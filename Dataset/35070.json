            "review_text": "This is a surprisingly thought provoking game. On the face of it a USA developed fruit farm themed time attack game from 2009 which employs the characters of Flora and Old Jim (who is an Uncle Sam figure in the tutorial passing on the old ways to the young, vivacious, hard working and obliging Flora).   Every good resource based game echoes the struggle for survival which humanity faces and this game does do that.  What I liked about this game is that it has on the face of it an almost educational potential to prepare the young for a career in a service industry and help older players laugh it off. I was curious that it embraced the almighty dollar and could teach gamers of all ages a thing or two about free market economics which also had a slightly dry edutaining feel, when games like this usually opt for gold coins or piles of gems. Also I liked how cheap it was to buy and how the fruits make a farty noise when they turn bad.  What I didn't like was what was left out of the game, which is as thought provoking as what is included if not more so. One gets the feeling that, intentionally or otherwise, Honeyslug created an ironic microcosm of power struggles within the US bread basket, which raises questions about modern forced farming techniques and the validity of the free market as an overseer of the long term health and happiness of the human race. Flora's Fruit Farm provokes thought about all that and more because it isnt anywhere to be seen, if you can make sense of that. Let me explain.  Maybe the games fruity theme was an in joke about fruit themed hi tech gadgetry, I dont know. But if it was it doesnt show and instead is thoroughly innocent agricultural gameplay in the sense it includes no references to gadgets or to controversial biology which is instead represented as 'magic' growth, shine and vermin removal tied to dollar purchases of 'fairy dust' and no hint of the related ecological or health issues arising from hormones, GM and pesticides which were the first things which sprang to my mind when I played it and imho should be seen in an agricultural game because it is part of the public debate today. The subversive nature of this innocence can be seen as acting subliminally for big chemical business in the way it neglects the inconvenient truths and responsibilities of agriculture, which speaking personally is why it fails to catch the whiff of the zeitgeist which Angry Birds for example didn't, giving as it did, players the chance to attack the greedy fat egg stealing pigs head on instead, which I think we all enjoyed. Flora's FF is just a bit too innocent to have that kind of appeal and studiously avoids any hint of the controversy which could make it funny.  I ended up wondering whether it was designed like that unconsciously or in irony because it feels like such a Macdonalds ready staff training game. But I am not sure if in the artistic process of true artists it is even possible to tell these two kinds of inspiration apart. Either way it ended up being just a little too innocent to be believed.  In addition the pacing and balance of the game make it something of a repetitive grind of mouse clicking, perfect for testing mouse to eye coordination and preparing the uninitiated for the arduous realities of holding down a job in a service industry but not actually that much fun to play for long periods given my life long aversion to such modes of employment, though in short bursts maybe if you like that kind of time attack thing its engaging uncomplicated fun. I do love how the trees grow so tall and full.   I was only a little disappointed that it lacked the glimmer of hope for the future which every tech savvy gamer knows robots will one day provide, assuming they don't try to take over the world first that is! ;o) What it did have was lots of fruit and we all know how food items go down well with the punters.  It is a curious early game from Honeyslug who went on to produce such amusing timewasters as Ric Rococo : International Art Thief and it would seem success changed their perspective on the work ethic somewhat when comparing Ric to Flora. I preferred Ric tbh. I cannot condemn them for what they have made here, its just too sweet and innocent and I dreamt about Flora all night long, in a very innocent way I hasten to add, for some reason I was lecturing her in forest pool ecology and she was a very good listener.   I can say that there was only one minor bug apparent when I played it in Win7x64 and I was able to reload the game and play on without major issues (just one tree not appearing in the plot map after restart, but it was there when you played the tree spot).   Because I am Flora's friend a thumbs up. Its sweet if you like that kind of thing. There is at least one gameplay video on YouTube and I advise prospective customers to go take a look at it, it is the ethical thing for me to do :)",

There are HUGE visual bugs, game-play bugs, it's just impossible to play for me. Trees are just growing by themselves when I alt-tab'd the game, my user profile just dissapperaed with all my progress, etc etc etc, it's just... argh... I don't even have words for my frustration. I would demand refund if it was possible, it is THAT bad of an experience for me.  PS: This is MY experience obviously. It can work perfect for you, I don't know.",
