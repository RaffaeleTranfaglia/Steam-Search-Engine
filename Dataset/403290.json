The art style is so simplisticlly unique and the soundtrack itself deserves an award. It's not about getting through the game, it's about the narrative that guides you. Well done Brain &amp; Brain. I'd love to see more of your work in the future.",

It definitely deserve a better exposure, the adventure will be short but you will want to replay it to see the different narrative path.  If you dont get charmed by its graphics, yopu will fall under the charm of the soundtrack!  A unique experience!",

There are branching paths, sure, but each one barely takes more than 20 minutes to sit through, at best. If you're looking for a game that you will enjoy looking at, and nothing else, get this. If you want a game that's fleshed out and worth the money, don't get this.",
