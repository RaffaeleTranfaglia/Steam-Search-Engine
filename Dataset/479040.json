            "review_text": "I finished the game in about 6 Hrs while being lazy. Only truly stuck on lvl 14 for second which made me think outside the box. With all that said, the game is smooth and polished... I died many times, seemed like the only way to progress at times. The game has various glitches that leave XYZ area boxes still visible from the mouse left over.   The game relates to Qbeh-1, Stephens Sausage roll, and Portal mixed as one game less than 20 levels.  Price Point: at $13, it's okay, in all honesty I think $6 is what it's worth for time vs puzzles. $1 per physical hour.  Either way, the game was an enjoyable twist on first person puzzles.",
