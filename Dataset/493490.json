            "review_text": "  City Car Driving is a very robust driving simulator with a ton of real-world scenarios and situations that will help you deal with a large amount of situations in real life driving. A large focus of this game is definitely learning, but they managed to make learning very fun.  One of the things that really helps it stand out to other games especially in it's teaching of things like defensive driving is the AI. You can't predict how other drivers/pedestrians are going to act which might seem a bit basic or dull, but when it's combined with the nice car handling and some nice scenarios, it's definitely one of the things that adds depth to the experience and tons of replayability.  Another thing that shouldn't go without notice is the notification system. It notifies you on absolutely everything you're doing wrong in real-time. An absolute necessity for some of the more complex scenarios where you can kind of get lost in your errors if you're not careful.  The career mode is where you'll most likely pour most of your time into on this game, it's where you do everything from practicing basic maneuvers to attempting to drive through insane weather on a timer. Although those things are nice, I do think there should be some more complex tasks, but mastering the current tasks has been enough challenge for me so far.  For what i've read to be an older game, the graphics are really nice and although i'm only just over the minimum system requirements by a bit, I can still run the game with well over 60 fps on high settings. While the graphics are nice, they obvious aren't the focus of this game.  Overall this game is definitely worth a look. I don't play many driving games and for that reason don't own anything like a digital steering wheel, but even without one I can still see myself spending many more hours in this game just trying to get all my tasks up to three stars. This game is great for both experienceddrivers and someone who barely drives at all, there is a lot to be learned and a lot of fun to be had.",

            "review_text": "This simulator is one of the best driving games i have seen, even rivaling games like Euro truck simulator 2 for driving. The missions are good for helping you understand the basics of driving. My only complaint about this game is the region settings. In this game you can select different regions to base the road laws off of, like American, European Australian etc, and on the Australian setting the map selection you get is less than the others and very few cars are right hand drive, but appart from this you can still have fun in this game.",

            "review_text": "Playing the game with american rules   Driving aimlessly through the city while drinking some beer and whisky.  Noticing a police car right behind me with two bad looking cops in it.  Panicking...  While trying to hide the beer and whisky i accidentally hit an afroamerican pedestrian.  Getting shell shocked and awaiting my deserved punishment.  The two cops behind me just keep sitting in the car, stare in another direction and do nothing.  Some moments later they drive away, acting like nothing happened.  Everyone else on the street just ignores the situation too.  I call the emergency hotline, but no one comes to help.   10/10 for realism  Would drink and drive again.",

            "review_text": "I have been playing this game since 2012, although i bought it today on Steam. This game is really good but has a few problems. The biggest problem is the Steering sensitivity and the confusing controls.  The steering is over sensitive, and if i set the deadzone a little high, the steering does not function properly, for example if i turn 10% in my steering, in the game it will turn 30%.  Graphics are okay and the loading time is terrible and i have no idea why. Euro Truck Simulator 2 loads faster actually. I would rate this game 4/10.  Please fix the sensitivity.  ",

            "review_text": "Wow! From reading the negative reviews I wasnt too sure if I should bye this game or not. But I was write, it ran very well on my PC which isnt bad but isnt Incedible. I was stuck at settings up my wheel but worked out I had to hold down my pedals and wheel to set it up. The Steam workshop fro this game is alos very and good and i like how they use real life cars ingame which can recognise but just wihtout the logo. Overall if you want a good driving sim and you feel it may not run on your PC I would still give it ago but make sure if your unsure not to stay on it for more than 2 mores or not do anything about it for 14 days or you wont get a refund! Well done to the publishers for making such a  Great",
