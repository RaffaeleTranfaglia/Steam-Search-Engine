            "review_text": "This a small TBS worth due to it's simplicity and effectiveness in its mechanics. It is a Risk styled game, where you control a faction that must destrtoy all enemy factions in a hexagonal tile base map. In order to do thta, players must generate income, done so by placing Harvesters accross the field; the important bit here is that harvesters generate income by smashing the tile where it was placed, in addition to all adjacent tiles; every time a tile is smashed, it lowers it's height, reaching a point where the tile fractures and subsequently collapses - what this means is that, as income is generated, the battlefield gets eventually destroyed, and by the end game, its rather common that only a couple of tiles remain in the whole battlefield.  The game is entirely deterministic - no dice is rolled at all. A duel is resoleved by the size of the attacking force, with the casualties determined by simple substraction (invading force unit count - defending force unit count). Addionally, all maps are perfectly symmetrical. This leaves the game's conflict to be entirely resolved by player's strategy and nothing else. This is easier said than done, however, as the tile destruction inflicted by harvesters (and player-deployed artillery) constantly change the battlefield, your strategy is in an ever constant need for change.  The game lacks a bit of variety, so it can easily become a little repetitive - this is not Chess nor Go in regards to depth. An expande sequel would have been indeed welcome, but this never came to pass. I still recommend it heartily if you are a fan of TBS.",

While you naturally want large forces, the production of forces comes directly from destroying the ground beneath your own feet. This turns an otherwise aesthetically pleasing but unoriginal game into a very compelling game, and also opens may types of attacks and force build ups. As an added bonus, it's (or sometimes is) a very cheap game to buy, giving hours of enjoyment in medium sized battles for pennies on the dollar.",

If you look at a screenshot, the menu on the left with 8 buttons are literally all the possible actions. I havent played it much, but in my experience this far, games consist of an early game where you mine away most of the map as fast as you can, and then you just poke at each other from the remaining islands for the rest of the game. This has all been vs AI though, and the game may be different against a human player.  I really like the general idea, but at the same time there's some fundamental things I'd like to see different.",
