Unfortunately I cannot recommend this as a simulator of mining or, if you don't care about mining, a simulator of business. The list of problems is too long to list, but any first year economist could tell you there are a myriad things ridiculously broken in the business model.",

            "review_text": "This game is just a numbers simulator, which is fine, that's exactly what I wanted. But some of the game balance is so hilariously off that its hard to play it very much. Contracts give you far less money than the open market? PR tanks and takes 6+ months to build, impossible to keep up with. Played a beat many of the objective missions and overall can't recommend this. I got it for $5 on sale. Definitely not worth the full $20.",

If you can stand working with figers and compeating with the demands for supply &amp; the stock exchange messing around with the prices then this is the one for you. You will need a clear head to succed and the knowledge of heavey plant as well as the safety matters of Mining and increasing demands for minrals!   Great Have fun!",
