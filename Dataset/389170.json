            "review_text": "This game comes up with a pretty wild idea: A game where all that you do becomes a part of the song. Then you might think 'hey, Bastion had this idea long ago!' and similar thoughts... But let me clear one detail: What changes is the song on the background. It might seem such a simple detail, but it actually creates a very impressive atmosphere. And the gameplay itself is that classic, good ol' 2D platformer we all know and love. There is a good deal of exploration to this game, and the items make the gameplay very interesting. Of course, there are a few parts where there's simply nothing much to sing, but that is actually better than if they decided to go full on looping the same parts that you've already heard. For now, this game unfortunatelly does not have an English version, meaning that only those who undestand Brazilian Portuguese would be able to play for now... However, there apparently are plans for an English release later on, so I recommend, yes, for those who already understand Portuguese and for those who don't, look forward for the (possible) English release later on and I guarantee: You won't regret. It's not too long, but the difficulty might keep you playing for a while.",
