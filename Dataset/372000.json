This issue was reported by dozens of people, over the past month+ of time and yet the only responses from any sort of administration were poor english automated 'GM' messages saying they were 'looking into the issue and working on a fix', which everyone knows is a load of bull when you only use automated messages for such things.  Now as a person who gets completely bored of solo play quickly and thrives on co-op fun... a critical game breaking issue like this, that doesn't get resolved and only gets met with automated trash breaks the game and I simply can not reccomend this for anyone who dislikes solo or is looking to play this with a friend or friends.  That aside there are other issues as well but alot of the people here have already addressed that.",

It is essentially still a BETA and I suspect that on 04/28/16, when it goes F2P, it will still be in a BETA stage. Needless to say, there is a LOT of problems and issues with this game. If you can think of an issue, it's here somewhere.  That said, despite all the problems, all the issues, all the frustrating bugs and more, this is still a really good MMO. I can't recommend this to people who never played nor enjoyed Ragnarok Online or similar games. But those who did, should definitely give this a try at the very least.  To the developer, IMC GAMES. Please take these reviews heavily into consideration. You have a gem in your hands. It just needs an aggresive polish.",

            "review_text": "I spent a very large amount of time on this game and I can say without a doubt, I do not recommend this to players. I listed pros and cons at the top with a brief explanation based on my own experience. Keep in mind I am a primarily pve player so my opinions on pvp are based on what I heard from friends and players in-game. I had 16 characters and 4 pets, 3 characters at rank 8, 7 at rank 7 and the other 6 at rank 5.  Pros:   Pretty neat and cute, typical anime-style mmorpg aesthetic. There a lot of panty-flashing swordsman and archer classes if that's your thing (personally it's a turnoff for me)   The art style of the npc portraits unique, with exaggerated proportions on most   Large variety of class builds with the unique class system (also a con)   Some classes have neat interactions with each other, such as ice railgun from Cryomancer's Ice Wall and Monk's Energy Blast. Or the skill of Dragoon 2 to double the physical attacks done to a monster through a debuff   A large majority of Cash Shop items (including premium tokens and costumes) are purchaseable from other players with in-game silver   Every 4 hours you accumulate 1 free tp (cash shop currency) to a max capacity of 5 free tp, so you can purchase cheap cash shop items (megaphones and revive crystals) each day   An ok amount of events to help the players, ex. leveling tomes, gem abrasives to improve gems to improve gear, sometimes tp   The first time you experience bosses can be exciting, especially world and field bosses which can take many players to kill depending on the level   It's not standard point and click gameplay. Blocking, walking out of AoEs, action-type gameplay  Cons:   This game is VERY POORLY OPTIMIZED. Even if you have a high end machine do not expect to play the game at 60+ fps all the time, IMC stated over a month ago an optimization patch was on the way but it still has not come yet   There are a large amount of bugs that go on for weeks, or even a month or two without fixing, such as game-breaking ones like friends list crashing game or questing in a party getting you stuck (this one was fixed)   Content updates are extremely sparse especially compared to the Korean version. We get their ui fixes before any content always   Your looks are based on your class choice costumes, weapon, sub-weapon/shield, hats, and hair. Finer things such as eye lenses, some hair dye and expensive hair styles are cash shop only   You need a Token \\ premium status to access ACCOUNT and silver storage, get 0 cooldown on attribute training, gain one extra run for daily dungeons and one extra reroll for cubes (The main source of rare gear)   *Having a large variety of possible class builds means that there are a ton of terrible to lackluster builds out there   You start with 4 character slots, if you want to explore builds you need to keep buying character slots    Pets also take up a slot so you need even more slots if you're using a pet class   There is currently a gacha system in the game, as of this moment I would not consider it pay to win, however it could go that way whenever the contents of it switch every 2 weeks   Premium outfits used to be able to be directly bought out of the cash shop and now they are locked behind the medal store which requires you to exchange gacha items for medals   A ton of reused models, textures, recolored enemies, reused bosses but with more hp, from levels 1-280. Variety finally pops up at 280+ content   The difficulty in this game feels artificial. Instead of giving monsters new moves to use, all the recolored higher level monsters are just given a enormous hp boost or enough defense or magic defense to render attacks useless   *Pvp is largely unbalanced, only solo queue is possible so you cannot play with your friends on Team Battle League   Depending on which server and region you play, the population could be absolutely terrible  Good or Bad? You decide:   To a certain extent you can solo your way to rank 7 via questing, after that you either need to do daily missions for a long time or grind in a group. At rank 8 it is no longer an option for most classes   Guilds require a rank 7 class to create with a current maximum of 35 members in a guild at the moment, leading to a few powerful guilds and a lot of inconsequential ones   PvP is directly linked to PvE, your gear matters, and doing pvp won't get you better gear, only abrasives to improve gems for gear   The game never evolves from 'kill stuff, ok kill stuff within time limit, ok defend this thing now' even in the endgame dungeon Earth Tower   The game is not finished yet, the rumor is that there are going to be 10 ranks of classes with a supposed level cap of 600 (330 and 8 ranks right now) and continued introduction of hidden classes   *Regarding class choices, because of the large variety of classes, there is also a huge chance for making a mistake for your class choices. You cannot undo your class choices without restarting your character. There are a few classes that end up with dead ends such as Corsair 3, without logical and good choice for the next class at rank 8 to take. There are also classes such as Highlander and Featherfoot who have their DPS literally cut in half because some of skills dps only work with certain kind of monsters. There are some straight up broken classes such as Sadhu which can cause a desync bug. Or flat out ineffective classes such as Sadhu again because their main damage skill can be interrupted by a single attack. There are support classes whose function is only to be a repair shop or buff shop. And then there are overpowered classes such as Plague Doctor which has a skill that lets allies ignore rank 2 debuffs. In PvP some class choices completely invalidate others. Such as Plague Doctor's Bloodletting completely shutting down all Wugushi's poisons. Or Sage's Missile Hole blocking all ranged and magic attacks.   The Steam version is the International version containing 2 servers for North America, 1 for South America, 2 for South East Asia, and 1 for Europe. Obviously where the company is based (Korea) they get the latest updates first, Japan second, and International last. The amount of disaprity between our versions is huge. Despite a few months ago a huge update to the system to allow patches from the Korean version of Tree of Savior to come faster to our version, we are still 1-2 months behind. For some reason IMC has been extremely hesitant to port over actual gameplay and content patches to our version, instead favoring cash shop updates and minor UI improvements.   All the fun I had in the game was in experiencing different classes. The first time experiencing some monsters was fun, but after that the game just didn't have any substance other than the class system to me.  And with that I'll leave you a checklist whether or not you should play the game:   Are you okay with artificial difficulty?   Are you able to invest time in the game to earn a premium token through silver if you cannot afford one with money?   Are you willing to reroll a character if you make a fatal class mistake?   Will you be able to stick with your goal despite it being stagnant for months? (PvE, PvP, GvG)   If you play with friends, are they devoted enough to play with you?   If you reach the 'endgame' will you be okay with waiting months before getting actual content updates?  If yes to all, give it a try, and I wish you good luck.  ",

Bugs are ignored, major player restrictions are put into place (trading restriction, auction house restriction, party quest restrictions) sometimes with the 'intent' of stumping botting and bot-to-player transactions while collaterally damaging the majority of players' gaming experience.   BUT THANK LORD FOR THE NEW $20 PENGUIN MOUNTS! We have enough resources to pump out selling material, but not enough resources to reduce losing our current players!   But legit, this game is in big trouble right now. Within the 2+ months I've played, the players I've seen in town have drastically reduced and the maps I've explored and re-explored (on new characters) do not have as many people questing or grinding as when I first started. If the top paragraph didn't make it clear, I don't think IMC cares enough about keeping its player base strong and unless they make a drastic change and start clearing up problems that the remaining players are complaining about, this game will die sooner than later.   Like what others have been saying, Until IMC gets their priorities straighter, PEACE!",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Tree of Savior isn't for everyone to play with as where it stands, Gameplay wise. Overall its a game with potential to grow but with its current state and management, I wouldn't recommend it.  Hello, Just writing down a review for Tree of Savior.  Let's start off with Graphics and Music/Sound:  Graphics: 7 The game being 2.5D is quite uncommon from most MMO's. Characters models shows decent and distinct design from each class and to each gender. Though at most times you'll be finding yourself to be looking similar to other players for Tree of Savior doesn't go indepth into character customization. Due to the character style and maps, this does give off the 'RO' Nostalgia for most veteran MMO players.  Art for NPC's are good, it gives of a different feeling from just being another 'Anime-esque art'. The environment and Map backgrounds are decent, they give off the right feel for each map for their theme.  Music: 9  BGM, Here is one of the good things from Tree of savior. The BGM for each map are different and gives out off the right vibes depending on the map and its theme. Boss Battle BGM makes you feel that you're fighting something extra ordinary, THOUGH this wil get repititive until later on for each boss fights.  Here but not the least: Gameplay, Community and Management, and oh also Replayability.  Gameplay: 7 The game starts of quite good to decent until you hit poor, rock bottom. Tree of savior revolves MOSTLY around on auto-attacking. From each class, to swordsman, to cleric, to wizard, and archer based classes will be relying on auto attacking whenever their skill rotations are in cooldown or as such until they reach the cherry on getting their supposedly rank 6-7 classes. Skills and Combat gets really stale for a while since Characters to Enemies, from mobs to Bosses will all likely be using/re-using the same skill animation and combat animation.  Progression in the game is very, linear the only spice that adds to it is that some quests are hidden from the quest log, in which A) You either consult a guide online or B) You spend the time exploring and talking to every NPC you'll be seeing in one map. Questing in the game can get REALLY STALE until the higher levels, in which some are riddled with RNG-based item fetching and etc.. Dungeons. The Dungeons in Tree of Savior are either your to go to for EXP at lower until high level grinding but as how it is the the entrance limit for such instances are limited to only 2 runs globally for all dungeons, and 3 runs for token users. Though I do not find any necessity to even limit such runs to a minimum to 2-3 runs daily globally tied to exactly just 2 tickets to use for once a day to a dungeon, which you wont be able to run others after.  Tree of savior possesses a number of different classes branching from their main class from Either, Swordsman, Cleric, Wizard or Archer, with a total of more than 80 classes. Diversity for each class in a game is a plus to me as it divides classes into roles in a party. This is a plus in my book, BUT at most times thanks to the META only a number of class builds and combos are gonna be significant for end game or PVP, in which making a number of class combinations irrelevant. Another thing, Diversity, like I've said just now; Diversity in roles but the issue is that each class branch either feels the same feel in regards to combat or skills, only difference are in terms of bonuses, weaponry used or gimmick.  The game's cash shop is quite empty as many would wonder but most of the part it doesnt have any pay-to-win niche items aside from the enhancement scroll that boosts RNG-based stats on a headgear accessory. Though one more thing, at early levels you might be bothered that some features are locked from the usual free to player, such as trading, storage being shared between your characters, limited amount of items listed on Market(Auction) and having an outstanding 30% tax from selling anything in the market. Not to mention taking money from the auction takes up to 48 hours. Premium, aka Token is the answer to most of these locked features and limited slots but it doesnt reduce amount of days to take out the money from the auction/market but reduces the tax to 10% though! I can't really complain much but this is quite a wall for someone starting from the ground up which maybe inconvenient for the new player in the early levels. The good thing about Token(s) are they aren't exclusive to paying players only. They can be sold in the market by other players, but they cannot be traded amongst token users thru normal trading means. Even though Tokens can be sold in the market/auction, The Price for it stands near the point where you should already even invested where their price stands. Which would take you either to be around getting near Fedimian or already around level100+ to even afford one through silver means. Although Tokens and auction/market are riddled with such walls, they did help combat RMT at some point of level but RMT/Bot users are getting smarter each day and are still eager even with the ban waves from IMC (Good Job IMC for being active in doing so!).   Community: ? In terms of the game community, The game itself has a friendly bunch but at the same time there are hardcore white knights in terms of either light or heavy criticism; Ranging from the Developer's stand point of deciding things and from the game's core gameplay. But overall the game's players are friendly enought or either too quiet enough. Oh for the love of all bad things, the game also has bots around.  Management: 6  IMC has been 'transparent' and been working hard to serve the game to the international audience. But with decisions made in the past in announcing Open Beta to be free from sometime ago into a sudden change of plans into deciding hosting an early access with a price tag of 50$. With such action this suddenly took a great turn into dividing the playerbase, though in light of the majority of the community disliking the early access model. IMC had rather made tiers of purchase for it, In which the community has approved.  One more thing, the fight against RMT and Bots. IMC has stated the reason for having the early access was to combat such illegal activity but the community are divided into either thinking they're just doing this for PR or are actually honest about it. Though no deterrent really last that long if it wasn't really supervised or well made, as bots and RMT were rampant during the early access and with some exploits on the background but IMC has been doing quite well combating them.   Though at the current state of management IMC has really been sloppy with assisting the game's needs and stability. Which I hope be improved upon in the future.  Replayability: Game gets really stale even for a grinding game. It doesn't offer much any feel of accomplishment or triumph. PVP is unbalanced for most of the part and it needs to be polished. PVE aspects as like I said it gets stale as it doesn't offer other gimmicks or necessities besides stated above even with Guilds.  Conclusion, The game may not be for everyone to play on but it does have its own gimmick and perks. It also gives off the same Nostalgia from playing RO from long ago but it just doesn't feel the same way. The state of the game and how it's being handled is quite so-so.  The game right now feels unfinished and still needs tending to. Gameplay and Management-wise, 'Premium' aspect of the game feels like a necessity more than a 'want'. Overall its a game with potential to grow but with its current state and management, I wouldn't recommend it.  Well, That's pretty much it.. Thank you for your patience reading until down here.",

I mean, the gameplay itself is fun... for a while. The artwork is fine, has that classic Final Fantasy Tactics feel to it, and honestly the storyline isn't bad if you pay attention. But once you get through the quests you can even do, reaching the next ones is a chore and a half. The UI leaves much to be desired. Lot of restrictions on random things. I really, really wanted to like this game, but its charm is ultimately overwhelmed by its flaws.  And from what I'm reading, they're not really doing much in the way of patching lately, and end-game still sounds boring. I also hated how there's no ACTUAL guild system. Can't keep in contact with your friends very well. It's just blah. It had so much potential, but let this one slide, the remorse is real over here.  Edit: I will say one positive thing that hooked me (and hyped me), it plays very well with a 360 controller.",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty fun. I first read reviews and saw the first 70 or so were all negitive so i decided i was not going to play. Then one of my buddies picked it up and got my curious.  This game is not complete. There are only 7 tiers of job classes taking you to about 225 for the last one. As far as i can tell, they do not plan to stop there and stuff will be added in the future. That being said its very similiar to releasing a beta of the game. That is not as bad as it sounds though. The game is pretty solid with what it does have and gives you a pretty wide range of classes to play. Thousands of different job combos for each of the 4 classes. And different ways to play through the game.   In this game you can grind like a mad man, or you can do daily dungeons and quests and level multiple guys at the same time quite effectively, or you can quest. If you quest, instead of getting the exp reward instantly they give you exp cards. Those cards can be saved up and used to push you through tough levels for you class or however you want. A neat and varried system.  I have a coin, but i can say that i played about a week without one and the difference it makes it pretty insane. Can't really imagine playing without one ever again. The coins unlock many features that are used to limit and frustrate you into supporting the game. I'm not sure if this is the best tactic, but it got me to buy it.   The crafting, item upgrading, gems, cards and pets are all pretty well done. Crafting is actually relevant for obtaining some of the best gears. Upgrading makes almost all peices of gear better in some way. Gems provide neat buffs depending on the peice and can be leveled up to provide bigger buffs. I like these systems.  The worst part about this game is bots and how they are trying to handle them. Atm bots are to a degree ruining certain farmable crafting materials prices by having them constantly farmed. This sucks but it also makes those mats cheaper for those looking to buy instead of farm, but it makes the farming yourself harder. The restrictions on trading and the AH can get pretty frustrating. They were put in to stop bots, but not really working. They are however semi frustrating to real humans. All in all though, they have already patched and made quite a few of them better.... provided you are using a token. The most frustrating part is that you can't move gold between your characters, and if you buy any item off the AH that has no potiential, it becomes bound to that character. These are not that huge as far as negitive impacts go.  I've only had lag for 1 day. It was the day they split servers. Can't really say its an issue at all.   TL:DR Its a solid start to a game with many many fun choices to explore and play out. Bots suck, but aren't that big an issue atm. Alot of the complaints i see are solved by supporting the game and getting an in game Token for premium features. That doesn't mean its pay to win, just lowers frustration level with trade and item limitations. Meaning if you don't have a Token you must be patient.  ",

You can't even trade silver so this restriction just bring stupidity to another level - It took 30 minutes to 2 hours for item to register in the market - It took 48 hours to retrieve the money from selling things in the market - Each materials are limited to 32 per item for the whole (day/week/month not sure about this) and the materials traded will become untradeable.

            "review_text": "Whew where do I begin... To start off I had played Ragnarok Online for a couple of years an had plaed other MMOs as well. So let's start off with the Pros:  1. Good Graphics - artistic and unique 2. Satisfying gameplay - gameplay is really satisfying since most skills will often have a substantial effect on opponents and allies. There are still some skills that need tweaking and bug fixing; however, I woudl say that the game's gameplay is still really solid.   Cons:  1. Grind- I have reached level 190. I can tell you that I have reached several grind walls already but the grind in this game is absurd. What happens if you're 10 levels above or below a monster? 10 levels above a monster = less exp (starting from being 5 levels below or above a monster); however, being 10 levels below will make the monsters hit you harder in addition to having much less exp gain. It's gotten to the point that you really have to read on guides on how to use the exp cards efficiently due to the nature of the grind of this game and how unforgiving it is in terms of gaining experience due to leveling restrictions.   To top it all off, skill resets are only allowed through the use of premium currency, which is extreemely poor taste due to how much grind is involved and how the skill descriptions are really poor.  2. Trade restrictions - My god... I have never seen a game so heavily restrict on it's trading before. You can list only 1 item on the market (non premium user) and you can only trade with other players without the use of the in game currency, which prompts you to barter. Access to the market is only in towns as well. This makes market use cumbersome and often not worth using for the most part, at least from my experience.   3. Pay to win- sever items from the cash shop give combat advantages. Token = movespeed. Enchant scroll = provides you headgear with stat increases. Mind you that these increases are quite substantial, regardless of what people tell you otherwise.   4. Techinical issues- bots, server instabilities, etc. Can be fixed  5. Class Balance and equipment balance - can still be fixed; however, I really will say that the items and class balance are really out of whack right now. As an example for equipment, I am loaded with recipes but I have no materials to craft them even though I keep killing monsters, which often have spawn rates or mob densities that want us wanting more in normal maps. Not that the materials have any value on the market anyway nor can I actually sell them anyway due tot he trade restrictions hahaha.....  Overall, the game is still really rough around the edges and has still to go through a lot to improve. Currently, seeing how this is going to lift it's limited access soon to F2P players, I want to warn prospective players that this is brings in a lot of the archaic and not so good aspect of past MMOs and fails to bring the sandbox feeling of RO in the game with all the restrictions involved.  TL;DR - remove restrictions, improve archaic and obsolete MMO design (e.g. old world boss design, market access, bad spawn rates, etc.), make the grind more bearable, and balance issues in terms of skills and equipment aquisition.",

Lag. The lag is awful and I don't think it'll get any better once the game gets out of the 'month early access'. It'll only get worse. Not to mention when I played earlier, channels were crashing, leaving a lot of players to go to 3 channels. I ended up logging out because getting any quests done was next to impossible.  2. F2P players are at a disadvantage. You can't do trades unless you have the 'subscription' aka token active. Like really???? Trading is a basic feature in nearly every mmo! Account wide storage is also behind this wall, which can be a real pain if you're playing more than 2 classes. You get extra speed too, which is useful, but this could be a problem in PvP down the line.  3. Shoutting gold spam. Every night I come on, I have to block the wall of gold spam. It wouldn't be bad if the chat wouldn't lag the game. ~_~ At this point, just turn shouts off.   4. Quests are boring. Very generic quests, but how many ways can you make kill -insert mob here- interesting? Also, make sure you cover every base on a map, quest NPCs are not marked, so you have to watch for a npc anc click on them to see if it's a quest. Can miss out on exp because you're not combing every corner of the map.  5. Research is a must. Before you play, I would highly suggest you goggle the game and see what builds are recommended. Granted, there's a skill/stat reset, but you might save yourself money/time by doing some research yourself.  6. Some bugs. I came across 2 quests I could not complete. Both of them, I could not interact with the object I needed to interact with.  7. Combat is rather boring. As a cleric, I lay down heal, lure monsters in to attack them, and if the monsters are 'floaty', I have to bash it to death with my mace. Rinse and repeat. I'm hoping there's more involved at later levels, but so far, I'm not impressed.  The good about this game? It's a very pretty looking game and the music is there. But as they say, graphics cannot save mediorc gameplay.  Could this be a good game? Yeah, with some polish, it could very well be a good mmo. But in it's current state? I don't see myself playing it long term. I might use as much as I can on the token I used and just move on to something else if nothing comes.",

There is a lot of grinding to the game and to all the people complaining about camped zones, I have a few tips. If you are in a heavy populated channel, change channels and start inviting or requesting invites for a party. When a party member kills, obtains, activates a quest item it gives credit to all nearby party members. I have not had any issue finding the mobs or quest items needed.   The biggest problem and turn off currently is the LAG. If you have to pickup more than 1 quest you have to change channels and wait for load screens or you end up sitting at the quest person for minutes waiting for server to respond with the NPC dialog box. This goes the same with most quests that require you to activate items. The first action on a channel seems lag free and then it goes downhill fast, making constant channel switching the most efficient way to play. This is garbage and servers need to be updated asap. Also because some channels are constantly being restarted by the server causing a disconnect when you join a mew one, you can end up back into a waiting queue if you do channel hop so be careful.  TL:DR - In the current state of things I would not recommend this game due to the shoddy servers. Please save yourself the trouble and do not start playing on F2p release because you will end up frustrated and disgusted quickly by the server states. Wait maybe a month or 2 after release and then give it a go. It is a beautiful game but the lag issues were present in both CB's and its doubtful to be resolved upon f2p release.",

            "review_text": "The game is not bad, and it has its potential, buts sadly the more you play the more you see that its broken. The nature of that damage could be easily fixed, but despite the tens of thousands of player who have quit because of it (from 50k when it opened to the 4k average of today and still decreasing), its seems developers seem to be focus in leading it to death.   Of the many problems this game has, which the tons of reviews and forum threads make clear, allow me to give 2 very simple examples: Guilds: In my opinion on a MMORPG Guilds are the core of the MMO part. Its the family that you can chose and that makes playing something more enjoyable, they accompany you on it, you talk and play with them, etc. A player with a guild (much more if is a good guild) would have a greater gaming experience and would be much less likely to leave the game.  BUT In this game, guilds are such a high commodity that almost nobody is on one. They are late game content, and extremely restricted to the players, so the great majority of the players can’t access to them. They require dedicate pjs, lots of money and grinding and still only allow few players leaving the baste majority without options.   Partys: Another core element on an MMORPG that its damaged here. While in most games you can have around a 10lv of difference from the 60 to 100 max lvs between the player and mobs, here with 280lvs you can only fight evenly with a 5 high lv difference. If you pass that 5 lv difference penalizations start applying, which increment highly after the 10lv difference and leave mobs with more than 20 lvs almost immune. As you can imagine, with such a low playerbase with decrease each day, on many different servers, distributed over those 280 lvs the chance of finding players which less than 5 or 10 lvs difference its bad, making almost impossible to enjoy most party content.  But the worst part of all that is the ¡¡WHY!! What do the developers have to gain by leaving the players guildless? What do they gain by making partys hard to find? Those two obvious things many have complain about could be fixed in a minute, but after 5 months and tens of thousands of player lost, nothing has been done. Players are still guildless and partys hard to come by with no reason for it at all.",

Can improve the system Trade? - You can't even trade ur silver(game currency) with ur other characters on the same account. The restrictions are to prevent bots and silver seller. Or so they said There are also penalties when u trade items  The restriction and limitation are to prevent bots and gold sellers(silver) So,now u can't see any silver seller. No bots in the game.

The largest problem of the game is trading restrictions: free players can not trade at all and premium players are limited to 30 trades per month, furthermore once an item that isn't equipment is traded, it becomes untradable, which kills the game for merchants. The auction system isn't any better − free players are limited to one auction slot, while premium players have 5, which isn't nearly enough to sustain a healthy economy. Furthermore, there is a 48 hour delay before silver can be withdrawn from the auction house, which makes a lot of players not want to bother with it altogether. The only ones who don't deem to suffer from all of these restrictions are bots and gold sellers, for whom it is a dream come true, considering all the extra clients they're getting because players aren't able to earn silver fairly. IMC has promised to soften the restrictins, yet have done nothing of the sort for two updates. And now to make things worse Steam regional pricing has been removed without warning, making the already expensive premium currency unaffordable for the majority of players.

The spawn rate is still terrible in ftp they completely ignored this issue outside of one patch note early that had no real effect on the mob respawn problems.   IMC did not fix much of anything from the early access to the free to play release. This game has so much potential but it feels like IMC is trying kill it with poor support.

It's marketed as a spiritual successor to Ragnarok Online, but I really don't feel the resemblance besides being 2.5D and having somewhat similar art.  From a technical standpoint, the game is somewhat poorly optimized and starts lagging considerably at around 10+ players on-screen, dropping to a janky 40 fps for a medium setup like mine. For reference, I can run something like The Witcher 3 on max settings at around the same framerate. For a 2.5D game, this is very concerning.  Gameplay-wise, I don't think it even captures the charm that RO had in its time. The overworld there was huge and exploration was fun... plenty of towns and dungeons to explore in no particular order. Here you've got like 2 towns and levelling is as linear as it gets. Go to this map.. level up a bit and do some quests.. now go to this conveniently adjacent map.. level up some more.. rinse and repeat. As for the quests, whereas RO's quests were hidden and scattered like easter eggs with interesting rewards, the quests here are a dime a dozen and either just kill, fetch, or click quests for some amount of XP and disposable gear.  I won't even get into the player trading, auction house, and botting.. a lot of people already have those covered.   Who knows.. maybe it all gets better in the late game. Regardless, the journey to get there sure is boring as hell though.",

It is littered with bugs, server lag, poor design choices and a lack of variety and content past level 120ish.   Pros: +fantastic art style - this looks very unique compared to it's modern counterparts while at the same time feels familiar to anyone who has played ragnarok online +satisfying combat - combat feels fast and fluid and attacks have a very satisfying feel upon use  Cons: -Server lag/crashes - when you are limited to 2 dungeon runs a day and the exp gained contributes a signficiant part to leveling, it is stupid for the instance to crash and boot you out while consuming a daily dungeon run -Horrible way to counter gold sellers/botters - gold sellers and botters are still rampant and doing a google search on gold sellers, it is easy to tell that all the measures this game has in place hasn't worked. On the down side, it is terrible for actual players. Non paying customers can only trade playing customers but any traded item becomes character bound (destroys resale value once you outlevel your gear). You can't trade money to anyone - friends included. Auction House allows only 1 item listing for non playing customers with a 30% AH fee (10 items with 10% ah fee for paying customers). You can only collect money from the AH after 48 hours. -Lack of content for progression past level 120 - unless you count endlessly grinding mobs for 0.01% or doing daily dungeons as content. Current max level is 250 - 300 so there is a huge grind wall ahead... -Dungeons become painfully long and repetative - dungeon design is uninspiring and only worth doing a handful of times but most people go for full clears not because it is fun but because of the vital exp needed to continue the grind -Though it is free to play the game is severely gimped without a subscription. It becomes impossible to meaningful play the AH without a subscription. For a grinder, efficiently killing things is ontop of the list of priorities but withouyt a sub your character moves significantly slower and receive 30% less exp  -Character stats cannot be reset as of today and while skill points can be reset - job changes are fixed. As such, without a lot of prior research, there is a very likely chance that you will need to reroll if you want to play something that is decent.  Overall, this game starts off being alot of fun with it's nice visuals and initially fun combat but soon devolves into your standard korean grinder. Implementation feels old and dated (something from 10 years back) and the sad thing is...there was no reason to make it as bad as this. Taking queues from say GW2 - you don't have to gimp non premium player progression - just add alot of visually pleasing cosmetic goods in the cash shop. IMC didn't need to lock down trade features so heavily to try and prevent botters. Worst of all, there was no reason to make the grind wall as severe as it is...The game has an enormous set of classes and builds to try, I would much rather play a variety of different classes and builds rather then grind a single character ad infinitum.",

And the devs do nothing about this, they could have a mute function, chat cooldown, GM monitoring,etc but no, they're too busy thinking of new way to restict legit players  + As I said, they punish regular players, not bot. They're trying to reduce human interaction to the minimum. Everything is restricted, no trade between players, only 1 item on market without token, 48 hours wait before you can get the money from the items you sold, team storage requires token, etc. You're no different from a bot playing this game, grind, do quest, upgrade equipments, repeat. No human interaction needed except for partying.  + LAG! LAG! LAG! Even in the least populated channel the delay is horrible. Your character attack twice on screen and only one damage tick appears. And don't even bother with charging skills. Fully charged skill with minimal damage is the norm in this game.  + Stupid AI and ridiculously short buff duration. I get that they want to prevent bot from afk farming, but dumping down the game just for that is ridiculous. Your pet, your summoned, your converted mobs, etc are stupid as hell. They do nothing and have no damage. The only thing they do is making your lag worse. Buff duration is too short to make support classes worth while, most of the time the priests don't even bother buffing you because it's such a hassle to rebuff every minute. And did I tell you that the buff aoe is so small that you'll miss most of the time?  + A lot of game mechanics are not explained in the game. You have to read on the forums for that.  + The game is no where near polished enough for open beta. This is more like early access. You literally have a dozen quests with descriptions like this 'Kill %s', 'Find %s', 'Get %s'.

Also, no resolution setting for fullscreen? Had to go into user.xml to change that..  Also felt like my character kept getting weaker as I progressed, I chose cleric which understandably will have lower attack but still, it just felt like the attack did barely any damage even though I kept putting points in int which it said increases magic damage, the cooldowns on Heal and Cure were waay too long, they also heal too much considering you can set it to only heal and not damage. I'm not sure if you can use a range autoattack but my character would hit the rod instead of casting a ranged attack, I had to switch to shield and sword, on a healer to defeat a random side quest world boss thing....  I don't understand how this is fun.  And let's not forget the rmt spam bots..........

Most of the time you hunt items or materials for the equipment you like but there are BOTs that you can see every map and its getting your materials. So yeah you wont get it unless you but it from Market which is most of the time overpriced and controlled by boss hunters. They list the names of BOTs in the forum but I dont see the one i report because its still there. What I think is they just write names just to say they 'ban' something or they dont ban just suspension of account?.   Server is lag most of the time. Your animation is delayed and talking to npc is horrible when questing. They seem cannot fix it even they said 'they transfer the server already' which makes it worse. Every tuesday they get 5 hrs maintenance but nothing seem to optimize and still get worse. If your archer you cannot auto atk on this.   I will leave it for now.",

I've gotten through what I understand to be 1/6 of my levels after 80 hours. (I believe the cap is 600ish and I'm in the 100's) It is the same repitition over and over. The bots are horrendous, the spawn times, even after the buff, don't allow for the current amount of players in the map to progress. The classes are underwhelming, especially if you stay within your 'Circle'. Also, PVP is pretty much restricted to end game only. The only PVP that I've even seen this game have is GvG. I was excited, as the game has the same art style as Ragnarok Online did. The gameplay, though, is a joke.",

Lack of unique customization - No hair color, limited choices on hair styles, no skin color, as far as I can tell your class determines your looks unless you purchase an outfit, armor doesn't change the look of your character so everyone loks the same other than class.  2. Limitations - Starting the game I am going around grinding and grinding and grinding just to try to make a little silver cause you can't buy or sell on the marketplace for three days, you can't trade for three days, you can't do anything that's not relative to you vs. NPC. It's too limited and I can't stand being limited.  3. There is no option to purchase in game currency for Premium, another fail.  If you're going to open up the game via Steam have everything ready... and don't limit the users willing to purchase your product and play your game... just the way I think.  The game play is okay, lags a bit, but other than that it's okay I suppose, i've put a good bit of time into it and have a lot more to see.",

            "review_text": "Summary  TOS is a beautiful 2.5D game with amazing artistic designs. Customization creates depth in the game-play. However, players interaction could be further encouraged. Game play needs to be more balanced. More varieties need to be implemented. Given the momentum of the developers, the game has a lot of potentials to be greater.  Pros  This game is an eye candy. The maps and character designs are amazing. It truly stepped up its game in the artistic department comparing to Ragnarok, which was a beautiful game to begin with. The map has different layers of backgrounds creating such depth. You may be crossing a bridge high up in the mountain while finding other players fighting monsters deep in a small valley underneath. A 2.5 D game with such style puts even many 3D MMORPG in shame.   The game offers an enjoyable RPG experience. It allows so much customization. The number of classes and skills in each allows two late game characters of the same class to have completely different play styles. The drop rate is decent. Gears are easy to get. I never find myself short of resource to buy merchandises. Free users are at little disadvantage comparing to the paying ones.  The devs are still actively fixing the game's issues. The lagging issue which was causing huge uproar was fixed in a week. The trade system has been brought back. The developers listen to what their customers want and they make it happen. This game is being constantly improved. Hopefully the user experience would be even better in the future.  Cons  The game struggles to create a cohesive experience as a MMORPG. It does not encourage players to cooperate. For example, doing quests alone is far more rewarding than anything else due to the low difficulty of the game. This results in every player focusing on playing alone rather than being part of the greater world. Remember the merchants on the streets of the major cities in Ragnarok making the world so lively? The market place is a cheap replacement to that formal glory. Even though there are plenty players, it lacks a spirit of a living world.   The classes are not balanced. Despite allowing customization, certain build provides far better leveling experience comparing to another. It requires user to do their homework before actually playing the game. Some skills are traps by being completely under-powered. It is not that kind of game which rewards you for being devoted to a certain path. Hence stepping on to the wrong path means either starting over or buying $ item to reset the character.  Lastly, behind its pretty face, the game gets repetitive really fast. All minions on every level feels the same from lv1 to lv50. It is great to fight a boss every now and then, but it feels like the same boss with different skins/animations except a few. Quest comes in different formats, but all too trivial. They should be more distinctive and memorable. However, the hidden ones are really pleasant surprises. I remember finding a red gem which took me to a boss battle against a monster guarding it. Make these more common! Overall, the grinding experience feels a bit bland.  Conclusion  It has been fun, but I am stopping playing this game because the cons outweigh the pros. I will not enjoy the same experience for another 35 hours. The game is still worth a try for new comers.",

There's no such parents who don't love their child, I also had believed that this could be applied to developer and game relationship as well, but God I was wrong.

I'm one of the most tolerant player you could have seen, I even don't mind if classes are unbalanced or the game in not open world, but 2 cardinal sins in MMO have been existing since beta which are worst optimization and rampant botting, and I don't see it will be resolved in the future or if ever at all.

            "review_text": "(For people who just want a quick summary, pros and cons are listed below. )  Do you love the original Ragnarok Online? Was Ragnarok 2 a bitter dissapointment? If yes....you can download this in a hardbeat because this is pretty much it's spiritual successor. This game was conceived by Ragnarok's original project lead Kim Hakkyu who founded IMC Games when he left Gravity game studios. This game just has the original Ragnarok vibe all over.   If no this game is still pretty compelling. You see I love MMO's but I'm not that fond of endgame. What makes this game pretty unique is it's class system. You start with one of the four base classes Archer, Cleric, Swordsman or Wizzard. Your max class level is 15 and every time you hit this you can either take a second or third rank in your current class or you can take a different class. New classes get added each time you hit class level 15. This makes your character very custimizable to your own taste. Currently there are 7 total class rank (including your base class) but more will be added in the future.  Tho not all class combinations are optimal all of them are pretty much viable. I personally think the class system adds a lot of fun to the game.   Honestly I did expect a lot of grinding from a Korean MMO but it does not become grindy until level 130-140 ish. Up until then there is a lot of content to go through. There is a sort of subscription you can either buy with real money or either with ingame currency which gives extra benefits. But nothing game breaking, of the group of friends the person with the highest level was the one that did not have premium even tho premium gets you +30% mob experience.   Yes going full free to play has it's limitations but nothing mayor....some of the limitations are imposed to make the job of Gold Sellers more difficult. Tho I think it's a nice try it does not currenly have the desired effect.   All in all I can give this game a recommendation, especially when the games free to play launces. I will list some of the pro's and cons below. Just give it a go once the free to play launches because well...it's free. This will definitely be one of the better free to play MMO's. It has been able to keep my attention more then any other MMO is recent years and I've tried many.  I don't get a lot of the hate this game is getting, frankly it's a lot of crying about nothing.  Pros -Undeniable and unique charm -Some fantasic music scores -Downtime gets you free cash shop items as compensation -Premium can be bought with ingame cash -Collections, map completion, mission dungeons give you a lot to do.  -Lots of content -Lively community -More content and less restrictive then most asian free to play MMO's  -Players get rewarded for playing with others  Cons -Other music scores can be throwaway and lackluster -Some of the measures against gold sellers do not hit their mark -PVP is lackluster and needs a lot of work -Party Search for dungeons needs work -Gold seller bots are still a problem (tho they are currenly working to resolve this) -Say goodbye to your social life",

Quite a bit of negativity going around lately but just keep in mind that it is still early days so of course improvements will be needed. Despite that, I've had a very positive and enjoyable experience so far and I don't see that changing anytime soon.  The devs are also constantly taking the voice of the community into account when releasing their frequent updates. The most recent update will alleviate the complaints on trading and team storage restrictions that you've all read about. If they continue on this path (I've witnessed no signs at all that says otherwise) then ToS will only get better and better.  Pros:  -Gorgeous art. Very unique in a saturated genre. -Fluid combat system that works great with a gamepad. -Tons of class choices (around 80) and even more are planned. -Stat points to customize your unique (or cookie cutter) build to your liking, leading to many different play styles. -Pleasant soundtrack. -Dev team that is adamant on fighting bots and gold sellers. -In-game bot reporting system complete with rewards and punishment for abusing the tool. -Cash shop pay to win aspect is extremely minor so far. Mostly cosmetics. -Good amount of crafting available. -F2P. Premium token can be acquired with in-game currency, which has been fairly easy to accomplish thus far if you know what you're doing (a few days grinding for your average low to mid level players, even less if you're higher level or skilled).  Cons:  -Needs optimization. Very sluggish in crowded areas, especially main cities even though you may have a boss PC. -Very linear quest system. Only a problem when you decide to make a few characters. -Price of premium (~$18 USD) is very expensive even when compared to AAA titles and their subscriptions. -Some premium token features (team storage, less restricted trading) are available as standard in most other games. -The sheer amount of classes can be punishing if you take a misstep somewhere along the line so plan wisely. -Low spawn rates (although this is always subject to change). -Huge item market selling tax without premium token (30% vs 10%). -48 hours to retrieve silver after selling item in market (to fight gold sellers).",

            "review_text": "Given that I speak from experience ranging from iCBT2 and, as of this time of writing, the early access my views of this game is pretty limited. But here goes:  The game is, despite the staggering amount of people throwing down 10 dollary-doos or more, a work in progress. We got in early to both actually play the game and to see if IMC can handle the numbers we're currently throwing at thim. Needless to say, its been...rocky. CommanderLoadFail and his gang have not been kind to us but given past experiences, what MMO has had a flawless launch? Not too many.  Still with little than less of a month left to go IMC has been dealing with the rampant issue of RMTs, Bots, and possibly the developer's curse of fixing 1 bug and spawning 99 others in its place. As a player I'm generally patient, I don't entirely understand or pretend to know the inner workings of a company when it comes to managing an MMO, so I put my hopes in the team to know what they're doing and not entitle myself to anything. I don't particularly hold this game up to other standards as, again, experience has shown me that I can't expect Game Y to be like Game X, otherwise why not play Game X.  Give this a shot if you have money to spare, if you don't then feel free to wait until Free to Play to give it a dip, Tree of Savior's experience is reminiscent of Ragnarok Online and hitherto vastly different from the MMOs in the current market. Which may in fact be one of the factors that drew so many into this game.  Just keep in mind that it's early access, it basically means an open beta so you're bound to see bugs galore and run into trouble every once in a while.",

            "review_text": "It's a decent game to turn your brain off to.  It seems like your typical grinding F2P MMO but somewhere along the way the rollercoaster derails. The quests will outlevel you or glitch and tou're forced to stay in particular zones grinding out mobs for 10-20 levels, some of which are being 'camped' by 5 person parties. It's easy to get invited to one of these parties but it gets very boring to grind. I can spend hours grinding with no objective and level up several times, and this is just 30-40... there are hundreds of levels. Not to mention leveling up your job as well which is a 15 level grind that is objectively slower than leveling regularly. Once you reach level 50 you can begin doing dungeons, I haven't actually made it to 50 yet. I made it to 40 just doing quests and grinding out level 30-40. If you have that kind of patience, to each his own but I need some faster gratification!  The game really suffers from FPS problems, the fps meter they conveniently place on the screen shows 60-100fps then quickly dips to 6fps when the screen gets busy. This really sucks because you're consistently grinding, and if you're smart you're in a party which makes the screen busier. The game is very demanding apparantly and I don't think it has much to show for it. I really support the idea behind this game but I thought the execution really needs some work. It's hard to be immersed in your character and creating an alt because that's a million more hours grinding which actually feels hindering.  ",

I wish that this game continues to grow and thrive, and that more people will come to know it. This is a wonderfully unique game with so much class customization, unique gameplay between classes and sub-classes, as well as a living player run economy of all kinds of crafted weapons, recipes, items, armor sets, monster cards, gems, hats, and more!   I am on Klaipeda (NA) and though the population has declined since launch, as all MMO's do, there are still plenty of people in town and you bump into people while out leveling all the time. Some sub-classes are able to sell class specific buffs that normally other people couldn't use, but you get to rent them for coin. Others repair your armor and weapons over the typically limit so you have to take less trips to town, and there are others as well who provide services to other players when they aren't out adventuring.   There are just too many things that are great about this game. I wish that you would give it a chance and learn to love it like I do. Whether you want to have a few minutes soloing and grinding for 'zen' feelings, or you want to get into a group to farm experience or items or run dungeons this game can accomodate many different feelings.   If you need friends or are looking for a guild, please check out the  Treeofsavior.com  forums as well as Tree of Savior Fanbase which is also a great website for mapping out your Class builds and all your skill points. There is also an item search database on that website for when you are having trouble finding something or someone.   This game has been touted as the 'spiritual succesor of Ragnarok Online' and it holds true to that, but It's also so much more including much more varied class choice, customization and an incredibly more fluid movement and combat system.   Good luck, and may the Goddess watch over you!  Eldaran - Klaipeda Server (NA)",

The base classes feel weak, auto attacks are VERY important to all classes DPS (just give us something more interesting to do!), attacks and spells are unresponsive and randomly fail. But I think okay, I'll give it a chance - level an Archer to Hunter.  My Companion AI attempting to autoattack can animation cancel Coursing or Rush Dog, putting the ability on CD and using the SP but doing no damage and having no effect. And not 'every once in awhile', but due to the awful AI of the companion anyway he'll pretty regularly decide to input a move command or something after you use an ability and nothing happens.  I could deal with the game if it was just 'some of the classes aren't that strong' or 'the game is really grindy' or 'there's a lot of bots' but 'this class feels bad to play because the abilities randomly fail' shouldn't be a problem for a game that had any sort of beta testing.",

(i7/980ti) The game design turned lazy at one point with their map bonus introduction. Lots of useless classes, thus in the end while having the illusion that we can combine all sorts of classes, in the end only 2-3 combinations are viable. When it went f2p, I've started a new account to level extra classes and teh only thing that changed is that they gained way more bots. The saddest part is that they aren't even considering to do anything about this. They have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bot report system that shows no effect what so ever. Same Macro users and Bots have been here for over a month now. Every 3rd player you see out there is a bot. Even players themselves are macro afking in multiple grind spot zones. In fact, they should just rename the game to Bots of Savior. This game looks like it still needs another good 1-2 years to refine and finish.

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game, but the experience was extremely frustrating.  First, the good:  1. The cash shop is no big deal. Mostly cosmetic and convenience items. The EXP bonuses for cash are small, only 30%. They don't create an immense divide based on shelling out loads of cash. Leveling doesn't take terribly long. The onyl thing worrying is the item that allows you to instantly revive where you died.  2. There's a large variety of classes, so you can play how you want to play. If you can't find a group, you can easily solo.  3. Cutesy anime art-style, if you like that kind of thing.  4. Getting round the map is convenient with warp scrolls and warp points, so you won't spend all day running all over the place.  Now .. the bad.  1. This game takes the primary purpose of an MMO -- having lots of other people to play with, and basically flushes it down the toilet. It takes far too long to be able to find and join a guild. Unless you're level 100, you are wasting your time even trying to find one, because of the pointless requirements to create one -- only ONE character class is allowed to create guilds, and that character has to be level 224. Why would you ever do that? It boggles the mind. Guilds are limited to 20 players initially, and can be expanded to a max of 35, further worsening those artificial restrictions. It will take you about 50-75 hours of play time to reach level 100 on your first character, BTW. So you basically won't have a guild to join until you've played the game for at least 50 hours.  2. All social aspects of this game are grossly lacking. Finding people to play with in the game is a pointless exercise in frustration. There's no system to look for groups except when queueing for a dungeon, and you have to stand still at the dungeon entrance while waiting in the queue. There is no region chat or way to create custom chat channels for people to join, like an LFG channel. The only way you can reach a large audience is by purchasing a 'megaphone' for real cash and sending a server-wide message that scrolls across the top of everyone's screen with it. A large chunk of players in the maps I was doing quests on were bots, anyway. All emphasis on being social and playing with other people is void. There is none of it. This is a solo-MMO game. Why would you play an MMO if you want to solo everything?  3. Buffs, buffs, buffs. This is another MMO that requires you to constantly manage copious amounts of short term buffs in order to be effective. You have to spam your buffs on yourself every 30-60 seconds, and you need to frequently return to town to get buffs from player character vendors to be able to beat enemies in a reasonable time frame.  4. The battle is rather simplistic, with really long cooldowns on your good abilities that you need to use to defeat monsters in a reasonable time frame. I was playing as a Hoplite, and I had to run around, gathering big groups and smash them with a skill on a nearly 30 second cool down. It made combat feel very slow.  6. Melee classes, once again, in yet another MMO, are mediocre at best. This is a constant issue in MMOs, and almost every new MMO that comes out suffers from this problem at launch.   7. Gold spammers. Bots. They've had an embargo on players for creating a new account for almost a MONTH and there's still tons of bots and gold spammers. Cripes.  So, overall, lotsof potential - but it falls extremely flat on its face due to truly confounding choices by the developers. I REALLY wanted to like this game, but the issues are just too glaring for me to stick it out any longer.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to love this game but...  I'll start with some developmental flaws: the performance is unreliable/buggy even on an overpowered PC - it is not optimized. Lots of 'rubber banding', frame rate drops and mysterious lag as well. The controls are shoddy, especially when trying to execute a directional move. This game has been in development for over a year now, there is little reason it should not at least be optimized. That being said, most of the flaws I will further point out are not developmental ones, but design flaws.  The economy. There are instrinsic mechanics set in place to devalue items, thus eventually rendering them useless. Trading between players requires a token. Tokens are purchased with real cash. This can be circumvented by buying one off the market, but the economy makes this difficult since prices keep climbing as silver-farming zones become more congested. You are restricted to selling one item at a time, unless you have a token. I would describe the real money transaction system is 'pay to make it bearable'.  Swarming with bots: This contributes to the poor economic conditions of the game, and high prices on the market attract a lot of RMT activity. This cyclical problem is represented well here. These bots will also be competing with you for farming items and money as they are seemingly an integral and permanent obstacle of the game.  There is a VERY restrictive cap on the amount of dungeons you can run for loot and experience. 3 mission dungeons + 3 loot dungeons (if you purchase a token, otherwise this total is 4) per day leaves you with little to do aside from grinding. There is not much raiding going on here.   The community. The game does not incentivize teamwork. Most things can be done solo, aside from running a few instances a day with strangers. The field bosses are on static timers, and thus are 'poop-socked' by the grand-fathered few. The lack of a socially dependent community results in lots of name calling, greifing, and general unhelpfulness. Asking questions will typically incite a response with the maturity level of a 'Your Mom' type insult or a snarky antisocial retort. New players are looked down upon - This is just the norm here. Perhaps all the flaws in the game leave the community feeling bereft, and they take their toxicity out on one another.   I put over 200 hours into this game, as well as founding donation cash, believing that it would improve, but it seems that the aforementioned issues continue to spiral downward and compound one another. I really wanted this game to succeed. In my experiences as an MMO player, poor communities and economies stem from bad game mechanics, pay-walls, unchecked exploitation and a pure lack of moderation. This game is a hot, steaming pile of everything that can possibly go wrong in an MMO and a sad dissapointment. Aspiring game developers should use this as a template of what not to do.  It is easy to fall into a habit of complacency when tolerating a game's broken issues in the hopes that things will progress. However, do not fall into this phsychological pattern and squander your finite time on this planet over this game. It is just not worth it. There are many great, finished products out there that can offer what this game falls short on.  My advice: find a stable, subscription based MMO with a helpful community and active GMs.",

Game has a lot of flaws, most major atm are server issues, euro server is not even that populated and it constantly lags, i am playing archer and i do double dps when it doesnt lag.  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ auction system - you cant buy/sell anything for 72 hours when you start to play, when you finally can start selling tooltips on items you put on auction(average price and stuff) are completely wrong, you need to check every material(and after 72 hours i had about ~90 of them) manually. But that isnt everything, even if you manage to sell something you need to wait 48 hours to get your silver. This makes absolutely no sense to me. Other major issue is forced party play. Being in a group gives you more xp then solo. In full group you can get 450% more xp per monster, considering half of the areas are dead/close to dead this makes no sense again. Why should solo gameplay be punished in a grinding game, i have no idea. Next issue is dungeon queue. Considering you get even more bonus xp(600%) if you dont make premade group for dungeon, you need to queue for some to get good xp. Well, 99% of the time you just gonna stare at 'Searching for party' window for hours if you have nothing else to do. Also game has no info on dungeon locations, but that is tolerable considering queue mechanic itself. Queue should be long distance and not require you to wait at dungeon entrance, period. Oh and 1 more thing about dungeons, 90% of the time you get nothing, there are total 2(+1 when you get premium token) entrances COMBINED per day. Actually its not that bad since you cant even find group for 1 dungeon, lol.  Now about good stuff, art/locations/quests are actually pretty enjoyable, characters are really cute.  But considering party play will probably stay same and I am really not a fan of grinding normal monsters with other people, i have doubts i am gonna enjoy playing this game further.",

Lag issue was mostly solved for me, so far I'm not having any issues. Gold Sellers stopped spamming shout since they tweaked a few things. One thing you need to understand is that we can't trade silver in game, so there's no silver selling. Gold sellers are there for scams. Bots can be a problem, but they'll have to be very creative to bypass the restrictions and ruin the economy (Edit: I can see now that this was very optimistic of me. They'll still need to hunt bots aggressively, and I hope they do.)  Looking at the market restrictions I understand why they did it. If you played Ragnarok Online (and albeit a different game, ToS is similar in many aspects) you'd know that game was infested with bots. They grew so large the staff couldn't contain them. They ruined every aspect of the economy, so much you thought 'since everyone is doing it, I might as well do it.' The trading and market system in ToS probably has that in mind, and that's why, even though I won't say it's a good thing, it is a design choice that could end up working with some effort. As for tokens, they're as low as 350k right now, maybe they'll drop even more. I hope they will allow some simple form of trading, but I can say that not playing this game only because of that would be your loss.  Tl;DR: Game is a lot of fun, the most fun I had in years in a MMO. And I played most of them. It has flaws, it has grind, but so far it has been worth it. Just play and enjoy. If you're waiting for f2p, that's okay, there'll probably be issues again but you will still have a good time.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR It's a very long story, but this company doesn't care about its players at all.  The long story: I purchased a founder's pack to Tree of Savior and was there the moment the doors opened (after having stayed up all night to secure a desired team name due to them not being prepared to launch their game on time). While more games are managing to launch without any issues, it is still relatively expected that there will be some kinds of hiccups at launch (although I expected this to be less likely since they've already launched the title in South Korea).   Due to even more issues at the moment of launch, I could not log in to the server my friends wanted to be on (Klaipeda). However, I could log in to a server called Orsha. At the time, the FAQ on their main site mentioned that team names would be unique to each server. I figured I could go ahead and grab my desired team name on Orsha since Klaipeda didn't seem to be online at the moment. I grabbed my desired team name on Orsha and soon found out that their FAQ was not accurate; They had changed team names to be unique to each region. They also changed the official FAQ a week later (after the early access launch) to reflect their new changes.   I have sent in six tickets asking what can be done to get my team name from Orsha to Klaipeda. The first ticket was automatically closed without a response. The second ticket was given an autoresponse that did not at all answer my question. With the third ticket I was a bit rough with the customer support and basically said 'You are wasting both my time and your time by giving an unrelated response rather than trying to work through the issue'. I then asked if it was possible to do a server transfer for the team since they had said they would allow a one time free server transfer for all founder accounts. The customer support answered and said it was not possible at this time to do server transfers. I waited a long time to file a fourth ticket; The ticket was filed when the EU servers opened up and they were allowing transfers from Klaipeda and Orsha to the new EU servers (but were not allowing Klaipeda to transfer to Orsha or vice versa). I did not receive a human response to this ticket; however, I was given an auto-response saying:   'Q. Why is my ticket still 'Unanswered'? A. The transfer tickets will be answered after the transfer process is complete.'  I received this response on the night before the server transfers happened. I had filed the ticket on 4/15/2016 and the auto-response was given on 4/25/2016. I was excited that it appeared that they had manually transferred my team during the maintenance, but upon attempting to log in I found that my team was still on Orsha. So this is when I sent in the fifth ticket.  I asked, once again, if I could please transfer to a different server. They replied:   'We understand that you want to transfer to a different server. Unfortunately, we regret to inform you that all request for server transfer has ended. We are no longer accepting request for Server Transfer. For future news and announcements regarding server transfer, kindly visit our official website'   For my sixth 'ticket', I sent a private message to a CM politely asking what my options are (even if that option is to hang tight for another ___amount of time___). I expressed that I simply desired to join my friends on Klaipeda with my Orsha team name. (I have not made a character and I have not redeemed any of the founder's pack items). I sent this private message on April 27th, and the CM did not bother responding to the message. The 'free server transfer' that was advertised with any founders pack has been amended to apply only to server transfers IMC wants to do. Originally, there seemingly weren't any constraints on which server they would allow the free transfer to apply to. Now, it seems they will only allow you to go from Orsha or Klaipeda to the EU servers, or the SA server.   I'm not necessarily upset about their lack of ability to do something that at the moment they just can't do. I'm upset about how they've been flaking me off for well over a month without giving me any answers as to what can or can't be done. In my ticket responses they've made me feel like I'm the one entirely responsible for my predicament when they're the ones that had an incorrect FAQ entry on something as important as team names at the moment of launch. If anything, it is a shared blame, but they have done NOTHING in an attempt to cooperate with me and fix the situation.",

Lots of classes, really interesting as well and a good diversity of classes and abilities, sadly the game doesn't tell you much about them or what they do, so it's almost hard to put this in the plus column. And there is no respeccing, so if you mess up, better reroll.  My friend plays it, no really my friend likes it, that's the main reason I play this game.  Negatives  Well the community on the games forums are completely horrible people, so don't bother going there for help when you need to find out the information about the game which should be included in the game but is not. Not only that but they take pride in the fact that their game tells you literally nothing about how abilities work, or actively tells you the wrong thing. They see nothing wrong with the game telling you an ability does one thing, but it does another, or Nothing at all.  Stats are pretty meaningless, they don't matter much at all. abilities scale so poorly with stats it's humorous, you'll have maybe 300 in a stat if you dump most of your points in it by the time you hit the cap, most abilities will do X + stat damage or so, of course in the later levels X is usually about 3-4 thousand. so your 300 in your stat is about 10% scaling. Not very useful, dump points in either DEX for crit, spirit for mana, or con for HP.  There continue to be huge problems with optimization, control, and server stability.  The 'translation' is actually a fan translation, no literally the company made their text available and said hey translate this for free. They didn't bother to hire a professional localization team, and it shows, it really shows.  The information transparency is TERRIBLE, just plain awful, You can't really learn what abilities do, there is some nebulous stat called 'aoe factor' which does something to do with AOE, it looks like it should increase the size of your AOEs, but going from 2 to 7 did literally nothing to my abilities/circles. Not to mention that it is a completely useless statistic that is 100% arbitrary and has no comparison to what people already know. Incredibly poor design.  You cannot join a guild until the end of the game, and only if you are the correct class to make a guild, yes making a guild is a class decision, so I hope you didn't want to be the other class at that tier.  The cash shop is the worst kind of garbage I've ever seen. It's beyond even pay to win ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it's pay for features that should just be part of the damn game. Combined with Draconian lockdown on gold sellers which of course haven't stopped gold sellers at all but have screwed all the regular players. 30 trades a month, IF you buy a subscription. 5 auctions if you bought a sub. It's ridiculous.  There is no respeccing, if a class doesn't play the way you thought it would, better respec. This is fine if it's a tier 1 class or w/e but if it's a tier 5 class that's like a week of playtime right down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Of course you only have the most vague of ideas of how a class will play because of the complete lack of information or help you will receive. The response from the community is 'just reroll it's fine' ♥♥♥♥ that, seriously. I don't mind rerolling if I want to try something new, or I had a cool idea, but rerolling because the game is garabage at conveying information that should be conveyed is just not acceptable. I'm not even asking for respecs, I just want some idea of what to expect. (if I have to look something up on a wiki about the basics of the game, then the game has failed.)  Overall this game is pretty, it wants to be ragnarok online, but holy ♥♥♥♥ is it just a completely half ♥♥♥♥♥ attempt to gouge you for 10-50 bucks.",

The reasoning is that this will deter bots from entering the game. Black Desert Online EU-server has done this, and their worldchat is still flooded with advertisers. Surprise, surprise, look what is happening. Surely, in all their infinite wisdom, there must be some smart programmer out there who can create a way to identify and neutralize these botters without infringing a necessary human component of a social experience? Oh wait, creating a system like that would cost money. Why spend that?  I still feel this game has a lot of fun for players, but cannot recommend ToS for executing this emerging, bad industry practice. Price was not a concern for me-- if the game was monthly-sub or buy-to-play, no complaints. If MMO features are going to be removed, why keep it a MMO? Why not just make it a co-op game with focus? The simple answer is, 'Will not make as much money as Nexon Cashshop MMO'.   I'm confident the game will do well and find its audience. Numbers will be fantastic when F2P launches. No crashing and burning like other AAA disasters. The playing community's culture will grow with the game and create wonderful artwork.

            "review_text": "Game at it's current state is barely playable.  - there are game-breaking bugs present at every turn - server latency is worse than you'd expect from an indie game running out of somebody's garage - at least half the content is either disabled or unplayable - there is literally no balance in either PvE or PvP (with the latter being non-existant except for guild wars) - several game mechanics introduced mke the experience even more unpleasant then it needs to be - there is literally no endgame to speak of  If you are looking for a game that will allow you to create a character and solo through 280 levels of killing monsters and occasionally clicking on an NPC to pick up a quest then this is the game for you. If you are expecting social interactions, a free market, balanced content, finished content, WORKING content or even PLAYABLE content - this is not the game for you.  I'm not saying you can't get several hundred hours worth of playtime out of this - you can - I am a good example of that. However you will find that it amounts to nothing in the end. The more you progress the more you notice that the game makes no effort to keep you playing, but rather just teases you to start and then says 'oh well, you got me, I got nothing'.  Not to be called out on empty words let me give you JUST A FEW examples of what you might expect later on:  - for those familiar with RO (Ragnarok Online, which this game tries to be but fails on all accounts by the way) you will remember that gear was enhanced with cards to add interesting ways of grinding monsters or make fun builds. In this game the concept is copied using 'monster gems' that add 1 skillpoint to a skill. That's it, there no variety or special effects to that. Most importantly those gems cannot be traded and as such you are forced to look for a 0.01% drop for yourself each time you need one. And yes they do drop off monsters that are as rare as a decent MMO.  - If you played any MMO you will be familiar with the concept of an Auction House / Market that allows you to sell items to other players. In this game however the developers decided they know better than you , and as such you are not allowed to set a price above or below what their algorithm picks up from the game. As such, given the fact of bots, RMTs and simply people not knowing the worth of items in the beginning you are now unable to sell most items simply because nobody will pay the set price and you are not allowed to sell for less.  - Recently the game has been moved from the Eastern US to several servers across the world. I can only speak for the server I play(ed) on, which is the EU one (located in Germany), but the latency varies between 20 and 800ms. (yes 800!). This issue is omnipresent and does not in any way limit itself to people with poor internet connections or located in specific places. It is also not at all dependant on the server's current capacity, since you will get a ping of 20 at midday and a ping of 600 at 3am seemingly at random. Latency changes (spikes/drops) can cover a variance of +-300 over a span of 20 seconds. It's a true rollercoaster ride of lag.  - Game mechanics itself is beyond unfinished. With several ways to control your character (mouse, keyboard, mouse + keyboard, pad) depending on the class you choose to play you will end up with a multitude of issues. Skills will not register, skills will lock your character in place, switching weapon will lock up the game for several seconds, latency changes will make you rubberjump all over the place. Most keys on the keyboard can be used to bind skills, but only a handful will work properly. Attempting to bind most skills to keys on the right side of the keyboard will render them unusable or make them trigger once/10tries if used in combination with the movement arrows (does not depend on your keyboard, just on the way the game handles I/O requests).  - Optimization and stable FPS are things that will not be found here, even by the likes of Sherlock Holmes. Simply turning on the map can drop your FPS to 5 for several seconds. Turning on the map AND trying to run or attack will plummet the FPS to a grinding halt almost always. At this moment over 90% of the players are using the lowest available settings and the developers have since added several options to disable most of the graphics 'fanfare' you might have seen in the videos - it did not help a lot. The game still uses a single core regardless of the CPU you might have and will (while still laughing at me with 30fps) force my Intel i5 to encounter temperatures that it has never experienced before. After several hours in the game (even if only at the login screen) your PC will be ready to serve as an oven/hearth for all your culinary desires.  I could go on, but honestly, try it out for free and leave as soon as you can. Do not spend money on this heap of camel dung. Don't get swayed by the first 100 levels that look and feel almost fun - check all the issues I've described above , and if they all pan out just know they are only about 5% of it.  1/10 would not get scammed into founding again.",

Even though this is a positive review, I'll concentrate in giving my opinion about what's bad in the game and what needs improvement.  I think if an MMO is to succeed for many years, leveling and gaining experience needs to be extremely hard. It should be almost impossible to reach the maximum level, so that the game could be more competitive and people wouldn't get bored of it, if everyone reaches the maximum level, then what's the point? So far, from what I've seen, it's way too easy to level up and gain experience.  The game suffers from bad lagging, it's very annoying, even with a fast internet speed such as 100mbps which I am using, the game lags way too much. It's so annoying to be running through a map, and return to the same place over and over again because of the lag and server connection. Also when killing mobs this happens, and for several seconds it's unresponsive until it finally responds and it's too late and you're dead, especially when you're killing bosses.  24 hour maintenance seems like a little exagerated, no matter how much transfers they have to make, at least this was their excuse, 24 hours should never happen. Even though, I believe that if great work and improvements are being done during this time, then it's worth the wait, but if they keep making such long periods of maintenance with no major improvements, then this is a no no.  Finally, this is the point that annoys me the most... We are playing an MMO, with stunning environment and story rich, so what's with the electronic dance music? Seriously?!? NO ONE wants to play this game and listen to dance music... A game such as this should have classical mystical background music... I don't know who's behind the music scene on TOS, but seriously, you have NO IDEA what you're doing. This is definitely the point that, to me, is more important. This kind of game needs a great soundtrack, definitely NOT electronic music and most definitely NOT dance music... Even the almost 10 year old Flyff has a much better soundtrack than TOS.  This is it, apart from these negative points, I have to say that TOS is very promising, and with work and effort from it's creators, will be here to stay for a few years to come.",

Play-wise, you can solo (even support classes can do it but depends on how you made your build) except for dungeons. Due to the looting system and being unable to trade (unless you buy a Token), it's better to solo when trying to hunt for certain items/equip because you don't want to risk the item going to your other mate. On the other hand, to make your quest progression faster, partying up is best. If I'm not mistaken, you are granted a party EXP bonus too.  For now, I'd rate it 6.5/10.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoy the core mechanics of this game but it's honestly being choked by lacking some very basic MMO features. This is caused by either cash shop nonsense, futile attempts at stopping bots, or a combination of both.  There is no trading. Not unless you use a token, which costs around $20 and only applies for 30 days. And even then, you have a finite amount of trades, and they only work with OTHER TOKEN USERS. And they DAMAGE THE ITEM'S POTENTIAL, meaning you can only trade it so many times without it being DESTROYED.  This means I, a DPS swordsman, am stuck with 3 staves in my inventory (because the loot sorting is random), while my mage friend has two scimitars. Both of which would be upgrades for the right class. But since we don't want to pony up extra money, those items are functionally useless unless you want to attempt a pseudo-trade on the market.  This is meant to stop gold traders and their bots, but the game is nonetheless full of them. You can't go into town, even on Orsha (the less populated server), without three alts standing there spamming links to a gold selling site at any given time.  THERE IS ALSO NO TRADING BETWEEN YOUR OWN CHARACTERS UNLESS YOU BUY THE $20 TOKEN. And it acts as if you're trading with another person: only allows you to trade ONE SLOT at a time (log on.. log off.. log on.. log off..), takes away from your trade limit, and ALSO DAMAGES THE ITEM'S POTENTIAL. And 'untradeable' items such as realmoney hairstyles are not tradeable between characters, as far as I know. Which means if you want to delete a character but have something valuable yet untradeable on it... you're out of luck, aren't you?  But honestly my biggest qualm isn't even the trading. It's the fact that skill resets cost realmoney and stat resets aren't even possible ingame without the $50 founder's pack (in which case you get One. Just the one). There are a TON of classes and skills and some of them are COMPLETELY USELESS right now. You chose one on accident, or just thought it sounded cool? Hope you like paying money to fix the mistake, or remaking your entire character.  Considering level cap is over 200 and this is a grindy mmo, as well as the fact that skills are constantly going to be being rebalanced, that is completely unreasonable. It is super easy to screw up your character permanently with no recourse. Skill resets only give your skillpoints back, too, they don't undo your class changes - once you swerve into Barbarian, there's no going back without remaking. I'm totally fine with skill resets costing money... but for god's sake, make it INGAME MONEY. This is a basic feature. I should not have to pay real money if a skill that defines my build gets nerfed.  A game with class diversity as a highlight should include the ability to reset and freely play with all of the different options, rather than expecting a player to carefully plot out a build beforehand and hope to god they don't get nerfed, don't you think?  The graphics are gorgeous, the game plays well and a lot of the combat is genuinely satisfying. And the class system is a really interesting concept. The staff has proven they're willing to work with the community to fix the problems, even if they're a little slow about it. But I would recommend waiting until it goes f2p at the end of the month. I can't tell anyone to spend money on this game when it has this many dealbreakers that are really simple, reasonable things to expect in an MMORPG.  We shouldn't be punished for really simple things like 'picking the wrong skill' or 'wanting to trade an item to my other character' and forced to pay money for them.",

NO! Kirito-kun is a myth! This game boasts its party system... which is useless early game. There isnt even a main quest that recommend you to party-up.   =If you came here for the dungeons and the bosses.. --Have you paid attention? Dungeon. Its basically, clear mobs, kill boss, get loot. Strategy not required. Except maybe for luring mobs. Same goes for world bosses.   =If you came here to play as a swordsman.... --Rethink. Or change class.. the weakest class tree is the swordsman tree. Later in the game, your skills become... weak. So weak no one ever wants you... unless of course you have a certain skill or youre a tank. Trust me, please. You dont wanna be wasting time leveling, building and in the end feel useless. Also, unless youre a monster riding swordsman, mobility is your basic problem when it gets to PVP.  =If you came here for the PvP.... --Its SO balanced! Physical damage can be blocked, dodged, or can miss. Magic damage doesn't miss but it also doesn't crit. Magic damage has magic amplification basically adding damage to your magical damage. But of course theres element resistance and magic defense, surely you can increase that to counter. Yes you can, wear CLOTH, low pdef, high mdef. Or have insane resistance to all SPECIFIC element damage. Or use all your skill points raising the SPR stat which basically only gives you SP, SP regen, block penetration and magic defense, sacrificing damage and HP just to counter magic. Not to mention the lack of CC, and mobility for swordsman tree. Seems balanced to me :)  =If you came here to be a rich man.... --You cannot be a rich man unless you can have what paying players have... a TOKEN. But even with that, it wont stop the market system's roof and floor pricing. But of course. selling and trading items are not the only mechanics to get rich. theres also selling services right?

Most of the core 'stuff' is there but text will be poorly translated, vauge, confusing and flat out formated so that it is unreadable. Want to know how long your upgrade will be? Fat luck, its hidden behind another text box. Currious what your monster kill stats are? Well... its readable but the infomation is all overlaping eachother. Oh what was that item you just picked up? Oh, no you cant see that, you just finished a quest objective and that alert box is taking up your screen for the next 2 seconds no matter what you press.  Most of the systems in the game are bare bones with no quality of life features or feedback. The marketplace is useless, you can put up one item at a time unless you are paying money and you can not even search for anything. Want some cloth armor? Too bad, you cant search for it unless you know exactly what the name of the item you want is. How about browsing the gems that are available? Nope, there are too many search results and you get an error message. What about that Magic Amplification property you wanted? Alas, that is not even a search feature. Then lets just try to buy this thing and click the buy button, wait what happened? Nothing? Lets try again... still no feedback, lets try one more time, CONGRATS NOW YOU HAVE BOUGHT AN ITEM PLEASE CHECK THAT THE FEATURE ACTUALLY WORKED (Paraphrasing).  Then if you try to leave the map you have to stand in a specific zone but again there is no feedback, is it the ever present lag causing me to not warp or am I not standing on the right pixle? Oh, and I had to run by that doorway to get to the blacksmith but now I'm warping, I didn't want that to happen!  *sigh*  The lag is ever present, if you have a full party your frame rate will tank (on a freaking PS2 quality graphics game) and your sound will chug no matter what your settup. Even if you are not in a party your game will periodicaly freeze for half a second, and if you want to open your map it may freeze your game for up to 5. Its incredibly frustrating to have a combo-oriented class that has 1-2 second windows of oportunity to deal large ammounts of damage but any little lag hiccup ruins it.

            "review_text": "TL:DR at bottom This is a review from someone who has not played the majority of the game and is still in the process of levelling, so if you're looking for some details for endgame content you might want to skip this review.  Review: The game brings an odd mist of nostalgia from Maple Story where you had to pre plan your build in order to min max and had to spend tons of time grinding but yet the grind is done in a way where it doesn't feel tedious.  The class system is where the game tries to draw in its players, there are a large variety of builds created by mixing classes together so you can enjoy a play style you like however that is also a big downfall, if you specifically wanted to play a druid you would have to trudge through grinding a cleric to level 170ish just to see if you like the spells, this can cause a lot of detraction from the game as people don't want to spend 100's of hours to become the class they want. Having said that in my opinion the classes are all different enough that I can enjoy the experience of levelling just about any of them.  The combat is simply fun, I don't know what it is about it but it just feels great to fight the enemies. Once again it's kinda like a Diablo styled combat version of Maple Story.  You always feel like your progressing because your always levelling up and working towards getting to your next class or circle, rather than the end game being where the fun starts the fun is levelling.  There is a mostly cosmetic premium shop, the 'token' however does give some small benefits such as more move speed and trades but can be purchased from the auction house for the standard game currency.  The OST is amazing, bosses especially have epic tracks which almost make it sad if they die too quickly as I would gladly listen to their theme all day.  The art style is one which could live like that forever its not limited by the engine it is exactly how the devs wanted it, cheerful but not distracting.  The game seems to have quite linear levelling options, all level brackets only seem to have 2 choices for maps which you can grind or quest in depending on your starting city.  As with all MMO's there are a lot of gold spammers and bots however the devs do seem to be actually working on resolving this unlike some games. (Blade and Soul)  Due to how you acquire stats / skill points which can't be reset unless you make a new character (Skills can currently be reset through premium currency) it is not an entirely noob friendly game, I had a friend who was levelling a mage and put quite a few points into Dex because he thought dodge would be more useful to him.  You can't level yourself down to help lower level characters and if you're more than 20 levels out of range of someone experience earned is halved, I understand this is to stop power levelling and such but it's annoying if you have to have a main character and a character for when friends are on due to work etc.  Rant: I dislike having to post a review, however this game is getting a lot of unworthy negative feedback regarding the 'F2P' aspect as of the moment, People don't seem to realise that you are paying to get into a beta version of the game and you are getting a month's head start along with relative premium currency. You could alternatively just wait until the 28th where the game will be free to play for all.  PROS: Classes. Combat. OST. Art. progression.  CONS: Finding a class you want to level. Not entirely noob friendly. No levelling down to play with friends. Choices of areas to level in.",

They are putting ALL new and old cotumes into this RNG box which will cost 30TP unlike kToS which keeps some costumes in the TP shop. There will be an exchange shop where you can exchange costumes/items you don't want for Exchange points. Some of the older costumes will be put in this exchange shop amongst other items like stat reset potion and some p2w BiS necklaces/rings (which is a negative).  Game still needs more optimization. They are working on little things here and there but it isn't always enough for some people and their PCs. They made an announcement about multi-threading a month ago but there hasn't been any news since then. We'll just have to wait and see.  I still enjoy the game, but I can't say everyone will and that it is without many problems. Just try it out for yourself. Most of the pre-lvl 200 content is easy and you might be mostly finding yourself soloing around those levels, unfortunately. It has become slightly faster to level though unless you're leveling some Full Support, no dps at all build.  --------  This game has terrible optimization and needs some work still. It's also terribly fun and I'm addicted.  I am a very tolerant gamer.  Servers still lag on ocassion, maybe more so for other people.  They need to fix the fps dips when there are a lot of people on screen casting skills. (Like in GvG and world boss situations.)  They also needs to up the quality of their customer service.  There are more things, but overall, I am still enjoying the game.  -------",

Being a F2P game makes it very prone to bots and hackers. Trading system is pretty messed up, and the servers are unstable.  That being said, this game is a Korean MMO so be advised: grinding is inevitable. Although the questing system helps you along the first few levels, you must grind eventually if you want to reach endgame material.

They're everywhere, and even the Korean servers have them. The developer either doesn't care, or does not have the ability to deal with them. Also, they teleport, and some aoe attack whole zones at a time and silver scoop.  2) Game-breaking exploits. Namely, a form of currency that can be refunded/cancelled before steam catches it leading to a mass-hoarde of cash shop items that are illegitimately obtained and in the hands of... you guessed it... flat out fraud tier-BRs.  3) Restrictions are placed to combat bots that are (obviously) 100% ineffective, and damaging to players as a whole. Add in the other locked features, bonuses... and the end result is this game is NOT free to play.  4) Things seem to actively be getting worse, not better. Simple fixes are not implemented: too many to even list. Pets covering NPCs, no way to kick players out of dungeons or find more from inside, a party matching system that is 100% random, ignores class and level, and does not guarantee a viable party... etc.  5) There is no real communication about any of this at all. Even basic information about future plans is inconsistent, at best.   It's this bad... and supposedly the game is ready to release? You kidding me? This is just awful. I could be a more viable gaming company as a one-man show hosting this out of my garage.",

One thing people trying to decide wether or not to play it need to know is that most of the hate is not aimed at the game, but at the bugs plaguing it and some quality of life choices that are easily changed (and, in my opinion, WILL be changed due to the community outcry and the way IMC has repeatedly shown that they're willing to listen).  CONS - The game is very buggy. I've escaped most of it due to being on the EU server, but I've had problems like not being able to log in until after a few tried, the game freezing during a dungeon (and losing me a daily run)/when someone tries to enter my lobby, etc. Nothing that makes it unplayable, but you WILL encounter bugs as it stands - Trading: you can't trade unless you buy a Token, and even then only 30 times. I have one but I don't know how I feel about this - The Market: you can only put up 1 item as a free user and 5 as a VIP, but this seriously screws with the economy because it's not worth putting cheaper items on the TH. I don't see how any crafting classes could earn money  Now, onto the...  PROS + The game is actually FUN. As in, if I was playing it, I would enjoy it in the same way I enjoy gameboy releases of Zelda or Secret of Mana... and that means everything for me. + A lot of great ideas have been implemented, like bonuses from collections, varied secret quests with great rewards, prizes from adventuring achievements (incl 100% map completion), chests hidden in random places, etc... it's GREAT  I won't make this any longer but the fun factor just makes the whole game worthwhile. I'd play it even if it was offline. So this gets a thumbs up from me.",

Cons - Overprice DLC (No way to topup TP just yet) - Game Engine is not optimize, roughly 20-40 fps even on high end pc - No good PvP system (class balace) - Laggy at peak hours (double on weekend)  Although there is many flaws, I still really like this game I do enjoy playing it and discusse which npc is the best waifu on world chat.

            "review_text": "Tree of Savior is a really great game with a lot of serious (but ultimately fixable) flaws. I'm just gonna do some bullet points on it quick.   - The gameplay is fun and addictive and if you like action RPGs at all you will probably have a blast with it. It sort of harkens back to games like Secret of Mana, Legend of Mana, and Seiken Densetsu 3. And, of course, Ragnarok Online. My only gameplay-related complaints are that it's really really unforgiving when it comes to your character's build so it's easy to make mistakes that will haunt you later on, and also that around level 30-35 and again around 70-75 it's easy to get lost and confused and lose track of what you're doing.    - The artwork and the game world is beautiful and colorful. The characters are well-animated. The portraiture is just awesome. The skill and spell effects are pretty cool. There is some flickering going on with things like fog and lighting and foreground objects (pillars, trees, and so on), and there are some clipping issues with the character's hair while jumping, but overall the game is really kind of gorgeous and I'm sad that I don't see more art like this in modern gaming.    - The game's music is super milquetoast and there are a limited amount of sound channels so sometimes when there's a lot going on sounds can sort of abruptly cut off and it's kinda messy.    - It's one of the most poorly optimized games I've ever seen in my life. I have an i5 4460 CPU and a GTX 960 video card (not impressive, but not terrible) and Tree of Savior chugs like crazy in towns and in maps with a lot of people. I'm talking 5-10 frames per second, here.   - The game is plagued by an ever-increasing number of bots and RMT spammers. There are literally dozens of bots camping out in popular farming zones using hacks to attack enemies at long range with melee weapons. It's a growing problem, but IMC seems to be aware of it, at least. They've taken a few steps in the right direction WRT the chat-spammers, so let's hope they keep moving in that direction.  - On the other hand, IMC has also taken a bunch of ABSURD measures to combat botting and RMT that are entirely ineffective and ultimately cumbersome to legitimate players. Trading is restricted to premium accounts and players cannot trade money. The auction house takes a 30% (!) cut of any money you earn from sales, ON TOP OF the normal posting fee. When you sell something on the auction house, you are forced to wait a full 48 hours until you can retrieve your money. AND you cannot trade items between your own characters (although they recently posted about this and might be changing it). Unfortunately there's no right click &gt; report function in the game, which kinda boggles my mind a little since it's a pretty standard feature in modern mmos.   - There aren't many hairstyles or costumes in the cash shop yet, so after level 90 people all basically look the same.   - In stark contrast to the beautiful artwork, the game's story and dialogue looks as though the localization team just ran the korean script through google translate and cleaned it up a little. It's bad. It's really bad, and I hope they fix that someday.  - There's a non-optional profanity filter in TOS and it's the worst and most invasive/annoying I've ever encountered. It checks words, it checks parts of words, and if you have a flagged word or syllable in your message, the entire message is deleted. Words like class, encumbrance, titan, etc are flagged because they contain '♥♥♥', '♥♥♥', and '♥♥♥', respectively.  - People in the game aren't very social, and on the NA servers there are a lot of non-english speakers. Which isn't a bad thing necessarily, but it can make it hard to make friends with anyone or find a group.   - Even now, before the official F2P release, the game's cash shop has some pay to win items in it. Enchanting scrolls allow players to enchant their cosmetic head items, and the stats on the enchantments (despite what the game's die-hard fans would have you believe), can be quite significant. Enchanting can add 20-40 attack power or magic potency to a hair ribbon, which is the equivalent of dumping 17-34 levels worth of stat points into your strength or intelligence. To put it a different way, 40 attack power or magic potency is around 15% of the stat on an endgame item. It's a severe advantage that you can only buy with money, and it has to go.  In spite of all this crap, I still love the game. I have almost 100 hours in it already as of the time I wrote this review, and I'm still having fun. So I totally recommend it, but I do want to stress that it is a flawed game. I am hopeful for the future, though!   See you in...uh...whatever this game's world is called (I've skipped most of the dialogue since the opening scene).",

I'm not going to go into too much detail in this short review but I've put enough time into the closed betas and the 'finished' release to say that I can honestly not reccommend it. It will hook you for a while but after some time the flaws about how unfinished &amp; unbalanced it is stick out and you will begin to question if the game is/was worth the time sink once you hit mid-game.   Right now 70-80% of the classes are not viable in the late game with no way to respec your classes other than make a new character, monster spawn rates are abysmal and you have to contend with bots (which there seems to be less of now so I'll give IMC some credit for that), IMC's methods of dealing with botters &amp; gold sellers also restricts legitimate players too much, frame rates can be horrible even if you have a rig way above the min/rec specs, the player to player market place pricing is a freaking mess. IMC being slow and incompetent when it comes to updates &amp; fixes with very little interaction with the community, the game still feels like it's in beta. I could go on and on and on.  The things I liked about it was the music and the graphics. Very nice animations &amp; artwork and some environments were very beautiful (the jungles, anyone?). I like that IMC finally added a report button to combat botters &amp; gold sellers however it took 3 weeks to implement it. Why it wasn't there to begin with is beyond me. Same can be said about them fixing loot distribution for groups.  Anyways, the game needs A LOT of work to win me back.",

Soundtracks are actually good. (No sarcasm here, really.) 4. It makes you cool because you (think you) are relieving Ragnarok Online days 5. It's free on Steam (aside from those microtransactions to make the game ♥♥♥♥ing work)  This game used to be fun until I realized that the management sucked and the game actually sucks in terms of the following:  1. In-game Mechanics  If you actually research how the mechanics go, aside from Block Rate is actually ♥♥♥♥ing useless, defense values ('DEF') are actually ♥♥♥♥ING useless. Ever figured out why most builds have CON? Because HP lets you survive, but DEF does not.  In short, 50000 HP + 1 Defense &gt; 10000 HP + 500 Defense  Also, most damages are flat-numbers which mean scaling is like hoping for the lag to disappear (a myth.) oh and I'm using fiber optics and playing in my region.  2. Class Balance  Other classes are literally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T (looking at you, entire Swordsman tree). If you compare rank 7 classes that fall under 'Damage Dealers', it's just a ♥♥♥♥♥torm.  &lt;&lt; Rank 7 Archer Classes &gt;&gt;  CANNONEER (Level 1 Cannon Shot) Attack: 150% + 1847 Attribute Damage: 0% The damage is halved against airborne enemies. (75% + 923.5) Cooldown: 5s LONG RANGE SKILL  MUSKETEER (Level 1 Butt Stroke) Attack: 881 Attribute Damage: 0% Cooldown: 8s MELEE RANGE SKILL  &lt;&lt; Rank 7 Cleric Classes &gt;&gt;  PLAGUE DOCTOR (Level 1 Incineration) Attack: 553*debuff on target Attribute Damage: 0% Basic Duration: 1 seconds Cooldown: 20s LONG RANGE SKILL  &lt;&lt; Rank 7 Wizard Classes &gt;&gt;  FEATHERFOOT (Level 1 Ngadhundi) Attack: 1132 Attribute Damage: 0% Duration: 13 seconds Cooldown: 12 seconds An enemy stabbed by this bone fragment will be afflicted with [Decay]. Enemies affected by Decay receive additional damage from Missile attacks. MELEE RANGE SKILL  &lt;&lt; Rank 7 Swordsman Classes &gt;&gt;  DRAGOON (Level 1 Dragontooth) Attack: 477 Attribute Damage: 0% Cooldown: 17 seconds MELEE RANGE SKILL  TL;DR 'Damage-type' swordsman is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T compared to other archetypes, considering most swordsman skills are melee, damage-build swordsman players can kill themselves. A melee skill from a Archer archetype deals more damage than any swordsman skill in the entire ♥♥♥♥ing tree.  3. Misleading Hype 'Spiritual Successor' of Ragnarok Online is a euphemism for 'It's made by the creator of Ragnarok Online, but it is NOTHING like it, aside from the mechanics that EVERY MMORPG game has.'  4. Free to Play, but you'll probably be playing forever and going to play with gears 100 levels below you.  PLAYER: I need to sell stuff to make money, but the game gets 30% of your profit, and you can only post 1 item at a time... I need to have more dungeon runs since I'm at a level where there are NO GRIND SPOTS, and I used all my XP cards... I move too slowly...  IMC: No worries, you can use a Token! (For 9.99 USD, you prick)  PLAYER: But I thought the game is F2P and not pay to win?  IMC: ♥♥♥♥ You.  5. And so much more, every reviewer has specified them.  P.S. I have played Ragnarok Online for 10 years, and NEVER got bored of it until last year. So it's not like I'm new to MMORPG.  ==================================================================================  tl;dr Not going back to Tree of Savior unless a massive re-haul (let's be honest, the game has potential) but for now...

This game learns the lesson by using fun combat that is satisfying, and starts where you have already gained your powers (example wizard already has a staff and does magic) and doesn't ruin the flow of the game like most new 3d mmo's do. I like this games camera and graphics, really nice art style. Optimization needs some work, frame stuttering issues near alot of people which is weird since theres nothing graphically demanding compared to something like a battlefield 4 match with more than the same number of people.  overall i find this game alot more fun to play alone, in a lonely channel. but if you do want to find allies you'll definitely find.  Rewards from are a bit different this time, instead of getting exp, you get a scroll that gives you a specific amount of exp whenever you wish to use it, this is unique because it lets you grind and save an specific number of exp scrolls untill you want to spend them on a level that you're really having trouble on.  Controls are great, everything feels just right.  Music is alright, nothing you've never heard before, but it does fit the flow of the game and is nice listening to. I was a bit dissapointed of the graphical options, i wish i could change resolution in fullscreen, or change rendering settings, how about low-medium-high-ultra and not just few checkboxes to select that are pretty much ultra-settings of the graphics. Another thing i have to point out is the controller support, finally a way to use the controller in an mmo without slow downs and stopping in combat. This might be surprising but i actually prefer to use my logitech 360 styled controller for this game, it's very fun.  to sum it up   PROS: *Eye candy - beautiful graphics , nice style. *Gameplay - Satisfying combat, fast and fluent, platformish with some beat em' up, if you do like the style of maplestory, *and dislike the slow combat of most mmos' , you'll definitely like this one , and this one even more because it's not *button mash 1 skill to grind, variation does matter and is satisfying. *Quests are fast and fun to do. *Music - i guess i just listened to everything that this just doesn't excite me anymore, but it is good. *Controls *10/10 Controller support in an MMO *A spirtual 3D successor to pre big-bang Maplestory &amp; Ragnarok Online  CONS : *Optimization issues *Not many graphical options, like rendering % settings or resolution on fullscreen, it's 2016 and every game should have that *Long loading times on some areas, distrupts flow of gameplay",

I can understand that this game is not for everyone, but as a f2p game I think you should give it a try.   To clear something up that I've read alot in other reviews: - Trade and market restrictions: the first few days I suffered from those as a free player. But I can do both now, it is an account restriction against bots: your ToS acc/character must excist for 3 days before you can trade/use market!   With every equipment you trade ingame 1:1 without tokens (premium) it will lose 1 potential. Potential is what you need when enhancing items, when it hits 0 potential it will break. The item will also lose 1 potential if purchased through the market.  If you sell something on the market it will take 48h before you get the silver and you have to pay 30% of the profit as commission fee and you also have to pay to get the item on the market. Premiums pay 10% commission and have more market slots to sell stuff.  - You can't trade silver 1:1! The only way to gain silver is grinding and selling items to NPC or on market.  Now for recommendations for people that want to try the game out: - Search for a good guide for the class you would like to play and if you want to go PvE/PvP/hybrid. There is no STAT reset currently in the game and the skill reset will cost you 88 TP (TP can only be purchased with real money, 100 TP is around 10 USD but don't kill me if I'm wrong). - I heard Klaipeda is the better starting city.  And some things that are still broken in this game: - FPS drops/freeze. Like, often and it has nothing to do with your computer/laptop.  - There are some bugged quests at least in the early levels. It could be that you're underleveld and get the main quest back after leveling up but there are still some weird bugs in it. - Marketplace with its set prices is messed up; very common herbs on sale for ridiculous prices. Silver sellers are most likely to blame for this. - I haven't played PvP yet so I can't say anything about it. I do like the PvE, though it can be grindy and the respawn rate is too low in crowded maps/channels. - I'm still quite a low level at this stage (level 65 rank 3 wizard, max level cap currently is 280 with 7 ranks) so I can't say anything about endgame.",

            "review_text": "  Before you begin reading note that most people here tested the game before it was even avaible for public, currently it's f2p and most bugs and issues have been fixed and no lag seems to affect the servers anymore, so forget about that, it's all good now, botters are also gone, Ave maria.  Cons: 1. The way I see it what matters is the experience itself and not the game's features, if you're looking for a good time with your friends, this might not be as fun as Ragnarok, and by that I mean, you don't get to stick to your friends, the questline will push you further and further into more missions rather than make you grind mobs in a group, eventually you will find yourself teleporting from map to map to complete your missions and so on, so forget about team work unless you're running a guild which is incredibly expensive or dungeons that you only get to do past level 50 twice a day.  2. If you like to play by the market and go full merchant shekelstein, go ahead, but not without premium, so forget your profit because you won't get any with a 30% tax and no currency trading or whatsoever, you can only trade items and with premium you get a 10% taxation on the market, which is still a great rip off in your profits, IMC crippled us good here.  3. Another problem you might find is leveling up, not that it's hard but you'll have a hard time figuring out when to use your exp cards and knowing what maps you should clear first, also, you must clear all maps and do all quests otherwise you stagnate late game and get stuck with no cards and no missions, you mustn't do them too late nor too early, otherwise you'll have hard time grinding less than 1% exp mobs, worst case scenario your equipment gets trashed and you are left broke with no money and no conditions to come back.  4. Unfortunately, aesthethical customization is an issue, you don't have many options besides your hair which you don't even get to choose the color, you'll have to grind mobs to get different colors, and hats are mostly either expensive and hard/impossible to get or they're so common everyone has them, very limited in my opinion, a waste for such a well detailed game. No visual diversity at all.  Pros: 1. Great characters, great animations and the music is simply amazing, it won't make your head ache and it synchronizes damn well with the map themes, the graphics are awesome and certainly drew most of the game base by it's aesthethic sense 10/10 for drawing efforts.  2. After the updates there is no lag and mostly no bugs, not sure if they fixed all classes but it's all good as far as I've gone through, the players in the brazilian server are quite friendly and will help you out, and most certainly will need your help in return sooner or later, goldsellers are unable to profit due to no silver trade and steam currency packs are now selected by server and will probably have different prices, so no more exploiting, no need to ♥♥♥♥ everyone equally like before, IMC disposes of a bad decision making team shame on them, but it's fixed for now, I hope.  3. The game simply offers you many features and builds, you'll find yourself immersed in your class, be it a full highlander glasscannon or a supporting hybrid tank heretic gypsie druid, althought some classes are useless as far as I'm concerned, you can ♥♥♥♥ up your character easily so don't go around doing stupid ♥♥♥♥ pretending to know what you're doing.  4. Just go and see for yourself, it's grindy but fun, everything about it is well done and the gameplay feels really great, the PvP is pretty fun too, the game is one of a kind, go check it out!",

A lot of children play this game because it's easy to learn. Complaining about beta bugs, and crying about spammers (even games like WoW still have them) don't warrant or justify a negative review. You have to look at the fact that this game IS good enough to get MANY people to play for over ONE THOUSAND hours. If it truly IS a bad game, people wouldn't play it for so long. So please take these salty tantrum reviews with a huge serving of extra salt.  --------------------------------------------------  I spent almost 150 hours playing the CBT and OBT of Tree of Savior and I can say that it is an amazing game that isn't remotely without its flaws or issues. However the most important thing is that it is fun, unique and a refreshing change from all of the MMOs that are mass produced these days. In addition to this the publisher (IMC) have moved mountains to try and accomodate players from various walks of life and parts of the world.  Since the Head Start was announced IMC had added not just an EU server to accomodate EU players in having low pings, but they have even realeased an SEA server for players from South East Asia. These are 2 choices that no one really expected them to do even after we campaigned so hard for more servers, so it was a fantastic and positive surprise for us all. Furthermore they even compensated players for the downtime at launch with many premium items.  Honestly no matter what way you look at it or what game you come from, the publisher (IMC) has been trying really hard to uphold a higher standard of customer satisfaction.

IMC does nothing on bots, has no rules for kill steal (KS) and some high end players can monopolize field bosses, which all suck. Also the whole game system should be re-designed. The maps are very cramped and the way that mobs spawn are even worse (like spawn in a fixed place every minute or so) with extremly low spawn rate.   It is very boring and linear after lvl 50, you will fall into a circle of dungeon, quest, dungeon, quest... Those quests are long and tedious, and always makes me feel sleepy. The dungeons give good experience but you need to learn how to survive first (especially when the boss are close to death, otherwise you will gain zero exp even if you do the most damage).   Also, IMC handles tickets in a very unprofessional and unresponsive way. They just find excuses to reject your normal requests with very ridiculous reasons. They just want to enjoy everyday as weekends.  Tree of Savior is the worst MMO I've ever seen (not even one of) and again, I DO NOT recommend this game.",

I don't really have an issue with this. Visually stunning, the story is OK, this isn't Bethesda wete talking about, but it isn't terrible. If you like old-school Asian MMOS you'll probably love this game   Cons: server lag and spawn rate of enemies are problems yes, but I expect the developers to fix these, the beta just launched for Christ's sake. I'm open to the possibility more people are playing than expected.   My only true issue is the trade and storage system, I'm ok for paying for these, but damn, don't limit me to how many times I can use it if I pay for it.   Aside from that, I see lots of positive potential for this game provided the developers listen to their players.",

Self explainatory, lag can make or break a game. If anyone knows what the term 'rubber banding' is- when you walk forward, you will be teleported backwards several times until the lag spike(something that is quite frequent in this game) ends. This makes any kind of movement in a major boss battle IMPOSSIBLE, as you will take every hit regardless where you move on the screen.   - God spammers. Although they're really in every game, this game has a global chat that is endlessly spammed by so many different accounts that blocking them is futile.

The map doesn't rotate but you are still able to see your character at all times unlike RO where you can hide your character behind something and have to rotate the map to find them. The skills in this game are simplified compared to RO where each class can have roughly 10 or more skills to use on top of each tiers skill set of possible another 10 or more. In this game you are given 4 skills each tier. This is one of the few games for the PC which has a decent joystick control. To activate each level of skills is just a trigger or tab button plus your gamepad buttons away from executing.   Dislikes: The maps are wonderful in their illustrations but I feel to much is going on. While my laptop isn't the greatest, dropping from 20+ fps down to 0 in towns is just to much. Having to run to pick up an item that drops from a mob is tedious at times when the coins they drop come flying at you on their own. Not having an option to change the graphics from high to low is a bit weird. There are things you can turn off but it's not the same as a graphic scaler.  Overall, I feel this game is nice but somethings need to be improved. Would I recomend this to a friend? Yes, because it is an enjoyable game.",

No trading for F2P or if you do pay you get a whole 30 trades per month. PER MONTH. This is ridiculous. Auction house eats 30% of your sale price, you have to wait TWO DAYS to get money from items you sell, and you can't even use your storage unless you're a premium member. Even then, when you do trade items between your characters it eats a point of potential and one of your 30 trades for the month.  Until they adjust this, this game will get a negative review from me.

It took several hours to see behind that barrier of cute graphics and great art. Gameplay and system were lacking.

And then instead of healing the product, they started adding those ridiculous paid features and restrictions to player trades and auctioning. This was game over to me.

Lag - the game's FPS behaves strangely a lot of the time no matter how powerful your rig is. I've heard confliciting things about this issue from various people. For some it's fine but for others it's not. With regards to myself, I've experienced quite bad lag from time to time. E.g it'll go from 20 fps to 54 fps to 30 fps etc etc.  3. No trade feature - I was partying with my brother and there was no way for him to trade a weapon fit for me.  4. Incredibly linear - if you were expecting a comfy game with some nice exploration then I'd give this game a miss.  5. Music - pretty subjective but I expected the music to be better.  Something I did like about the game is the combat and the amount of classes though. If you're willing to put up with a few cons and you don't mind linear games then this might be for you.

Bots, those bots, that exist in every single online game, everyone seems to blame the publisher, complaining that they didn't do their job to ban them. I, however, feel that bots are there because of the players. The gold sellers use bots to farm their product, and we buy from them, that's why they are here, to fulfill our needs.  I will have to agree that compare to games 10-20 years ago, the bugs are intolerable. There was a time when a game is officially out, they are supposed to be no bug, only minor glitch. Again, who can we blame? Give it a thought if you bother, ignore if you don't.  Overall, this is a game that I will keep playing for a long long time ever since RO, RF, WOW.",

There are also so many senseless reviews, like players who gave overall negative review yet they've continued playing for dozens or hundreds of hours after that, and there are players who try to play this game with stone age calculators and complaining how the game can't run properly.  Anyways, I think this game is something people might want to give a shot and if you're unsure or low on extra cash to spend on games, the game goes f2p after few weeks.   F2p limitations seems reasonable to me btw. I'm planning on going half time f2p half time buying tokens myself. After the next patch apparently trading will be less limited for f2p players too.",

After that you need to hold your cards from 130-160 (Dungeon + Mission).  Then use your cards from 160 to 175. (because dun160 sucks)  Keep your cards until 190 (Dungeon + mission)  Hold your cards until 206-210, then use then for reach 217.  Keep your cards until 230+-, then use then to reach 240.  After that, the game dont have quests anymore, so just play dungeon+mission and get some cards from Battle League. -Also looking in the world map in tosbase website helps a lot.",

Cons: Bots : are very bad, so far nothing to bad what am I kidding Bots are aweful man you have no idea. Blocking up instances. I am sure it will be taken care sooner or later. Less talkitive: There is few people that really talk due to the way the game is dont try to join a guild at a low level. Most of the time they will spit and laugh at your newbieness Con: Klaphia server has Kirito and desu guild bunch of ♥♥♥ holes lol. Trades: If you trade with a tnon token user the item gets locked.

I was extremely hyped and waited for the game, i didnt slept because i wanted to be one of the first to secure my character names and grind level. The founder pack was to give experience to players who bought it yet it was all a disappointment. First of all the delay, then the in-game lags (FPS drops and high pings cause of different regions) and now? I have to wait for 2 hours plus just to play lol I waited for 2 hours to play just now then disconnected and i have to reque again. I have to que like 1600 every time i disconnect. Out of 1600 players? Seriously? My point is, you already know your server is going to be flooded, yet u cant handle it. Damn waste of money &amp; time. Disappointed. I suggest players to think twice before buying the DLC pack. Would not recommend it. Oh and please not be fooled by 'You can choose to change your team name afterwards'. It costs you penny to just change the stupid name. I thought character name was to be secured but then it was the team name and i have to spend money just to change it. Im a person that rarely give negative reviews yet this is so disappointing. At first i was so hyped and so exicited ya know but then it all went down the drain.  UPDATE : I WROTE IN TICKETS IN THEIR FORUM. And i got some replies day after. IMC gave me a 150 TP refund and im so happy with it ! Probably did they read my review or something? LOL because everything i stated up there was fixed few days after.. SEA region came out and was smooth af (no more 1600 que) and i got a tp refund as well.. sooo for now im enjoying the game with my friends.. probably will update my review again..

            "review_text": "I played this during one of the betas a few months ago. Maybe I'm just too old and jaded for nostalgic video games now, but I didn't really enjoy it. I made it to about level 100 (which admittedly isn't very far in this game) and all I ever did was get shuffled around from area to area doing quests, then stop and do an instance for a couple of days to load up on exp from that. It got boring VERY quickly. The instances are fun at first, as they don't really use the 'trinity' system from normal MMOs. You can go with the standard tank/healer/3dps setup or you could have 5 dps classes and as long as one or two of them has a few ranks in a heal skill normally your party would be okay.  There isn't really much point to player interaction outside of instances which is kind of sad as this is supposed to be a multiplayer game. Most MMOs seem to be going down this road though.  The class selection is vast and I think that will be the draw to this game for a lot of people. There are I think 50+ classes and HUNDREDS of combinations you can go with as each class is a 'tier' and as you climb the ladder so to speak to the upper tiers you can take any class you want. If a class is really good you can choose to take that class again to make its abilities better and even get access to new abilities in some cases. There are classes even focused on non-combat stuff such as potion makers, scroll sellers (you can take any ability you have and sell a single use of it to other players, really useful for buffs and stuff) and even a class that can repair gear and give out buffs with a meal table wherever you are in the world. This is probably the high point of the game. There is so much variety between players that even if two people are the same class they could be completely different due to taking a completely different path to get to that class.  In closing this game will probably be a lot of fun for people but it definatly isn't for me. Wouldn't reccomend unless you're into min-maxing, or creating the perfect character in a game with a ton of choice.",

Is this a Gameboy emulator?), incompetent asian voice actors not able to pronounce even 'energy bolt' correctly, nonexistent story, preposterous economy and the joy of competing to get the last hit which is nonsensical because any AoE skill can 'overkill' an entire group of monsters.  Character customization is absolutely null. There are merely 4 stereotypical classes to choose from. Don't let the '80 classes' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t fool you, each of them only add three or four skills and that's it (Assuming you get past the boredom of grinding and the class advancement quests). Also, you can't choose your hair's color and your clothes depend on your class.  In the game you play the role of a 'Revelator' (They never bothered to explain what a 'Revelator' is) and the 'demons' are after the 'light of salvation' (More gibberish they pull from their butts, go figure). Afterwards you will be randomly teleported to some random place where random NPCs will tell you random irrelevant crap, then the predictable 'kill this', 'get this', 'talk to him' quests begin.  I spent a long time following a misleading green arrow that kept teleporting me in and out from a building. Apparently that is supposed to be some sort of door and the marker for my quest disappeared, not intuitive at all.

The Bearkaras Fragment was restored to my inventory and I have started to play the game again.  Though there are remaining issues with the game as detailed by others in their reviews, I now feel comfortable recommending this game.   Original review fiollows:  I purchased the Founders Server: Exclusive Access 1 DLC and played the game to reach around level 80. The game is enjoyable for the most part but seems to have some major design flaws. I have stopped playing the game due to one of these flaws.  The major problems I experienced with the game are:  1. Support: I could not find a way to contact a GM or open a trouble ticket in game. I had to go to the website to submit a ticket. To submit a ticket or post on the forum, you have to login with a Facebook or Google+ account. Your Google+ user name is displayed in the forum post it you login using your Google+ account. I was able to receive a response when submitting a problem report via Email but it appears TOS support has ceased all Email responses.  2. Boss Item Drops: Many of the bosses can only be fought a single time and they provide a unique drop when defeated. Many of these unique item drops are necessary for recipes to create items critical to character progression. This is all well and good until, as in my case, one of these unique items fails to drop when a boss is defeated. My problem is that the Bearkaras Fragment was not received when I defeated Bearkaras (I defeated this boss around level 80). I am not able to craft the Zachariel Bangle which effectively results in my character status being 15 levels below normal. I consider the lack of the Zachariel Bangle such a detriment that the game is not worth playing any longer.   3. Inability to resolve issues: When I discovered I was missing the Bearkaras Fragment, I opened a support ticket. I did receive an answer that the information was being forwarded to the developers to prevent occurrences of a similar problem in the future. I did not receive any indication that the missing item would be restored in my inventory so a followed up with a forum post in the Game Bugs area asking if I could expect the missing item restored or the quest reset. I have not received a response to my forum post to date. I finally wrote an Email to the TOS support that included a copy of the forum post and ticket text. I also included screenshots to show I defeated the boss but didn't have the fragment in my inventory. I have not received a response to this Email.  I consider the game unplayable without the Zachariel Bangle and am disappointed as I was hoping to play the game at higher levels. I believe I have done my utmost to resolve the issue but have not received the appropriate response from TOS support.  I cannot at this time recommend the game due to the problems I've encountered. I will update this post if this situation changes.",

I really miss the tank type, but TOS is most focused in damage (even for the cleric classes), so making a full HP warrior is not recommendable. Really, I tried.  So, about the music, the aesthetics and landscapes, I have nothing bad to say. They are beautiful. It is like playing a better Ragnarok Online, the same thing as many people think by now.  No mentions about the story, what is easy and maybe a little plain. Quests are easy to understand, so you have no problems to start gaining exp.  There are some little bugs, however, that must be fixed, and some decisions that are a little… odd. Like the censure. What the hell? I’m not a native English, so my vocabulary may have “words” censored without any reason… IMC MUST fix that, because it’s so hard and tiring to TALK with your party.  There are other things that I hope IMC will change and improve (no trade of silver, 48h of delay when sell in the market, the incredible market fee…).

The openess of the world and the freedom to build gear sets for specific dungeons. And why was that desireable? Because the economy thrived on rare drops found only from specific mobs in specific places. Being able to gear towards +wind elemental damage and +damage to fish and water type monsters would allow you to farm Bib so much faster and efficiently than those who had genereic gear. Collecting drops which had a 1 in 10,000 chance became much more freequent when you had approreate gear - which in turn allowed you to finance more gear sets and higher upgrades on your armor.  I didn't catch any of that in ToS. Maybe there is more of that towards the end game but if there is; why do you have to play through so much of the world just to get there? None of the world seemed reusable in ToS. Once you out-leveled a zone, there didn't seem to ever be a reason to go back.   The way ToS has designed their class pathing, gear, item drops and player economy just seems more restrictive and more generic than RO. I'd have to even say their '80 different' classes is a bit of an overstatement. So many of the classes you only take for one tier as it serves as nothing more than a stepping stone to get to the higher classes.",

You can choose your skill and status points and other things that you don't see in nowadays mmos. It is an old and new mmorpg at the same time. But the game is recent, first week of early access, and because of it, it has a lot of problems, like some bugs. And they are trying to control bots and gold sellers with 'not popular' ways, like limiting trading. But I really think that in time and with the support of those who believe in the game, it will become a big, fun and beautiful game, where the journey until you reach the last level will be so important as the endgame. In my opinion, it is really difficult to find a good game, but this is REALLY a good game, that it is still incomplete. It is free to play, but for getting the most of the game you surely will have to pay, not because it is pay to win, but the mechanics of the game is limited for those who don't pay it. I personally don't mind, because most of the good game are pay to play, like WoW or FFXIV. So it is like they let you play it and test it, long as you want, but to play seriously you will WANT to pay it.  O jogo é maravilhoso! Algo que eu tenho esperado por anos! Muitas classes e niveis! Você pode escolher as suas habilidades e seus pontos de atributos (como força e inteligencia) de uma forma que eu não via a muito tempo nos mmos. Ele é um mmorpg com detalhes antigos e novos ao mesmo tempo. Mas como é recente, e está na primeira semana de ascesso antecipado, ele tem alguns bugs e problemas de servidor. Além do que a IMC está tentando conter of bots e vededores de gold com algumas medidas não populares como por exemplo limitar a troca de itens. Mas eu realmente acho que dentro de algum tempo e com o suporte de quem acredita nesse jogo, ele vai se tornar um jogo grande, divertido e maravilhoso, em que a jornada para chegar ao final valerá tanto a pena quanto o endgame. Na minha opnião, anda bem dificil encontrar um novo jogo, mas esse é um bom jogo, que porém ainda está incompleto. Ele é gratis, mas para se aprofundar no jogo vc terá que pagar, não por ser pay to win (p2w), mas pelas mecanicas serem limitadas para quem não paga. Pessoalmente eu não ligo, visto que os melhores jogos atuais são pagos de qualquer forma, assim como WoW e FFXIV. Então é como se eles deixassem vc jogar e testar o quanto tempo vc quiser, mas para jogar sério vc vai acabar querendo pagar algo,",

The character models, the background, the enemies, and even the UI. It just meshes together to really bring back a nostalgic feel that I feel a lot of old school MMO players would appreciate.  I also want to emphasize on another winning formula of this game; the music. Cerulean Wind, 3rd Wave, Due Solo. It's been a while since I played the beta, but I still remember the game themes clear as day.  If there's something they could have done more, is to provide a better information base within the game itself. While they've done an amazing job with this so far, there's still room for improvement.  - Show what upgrades do past not only the first level, in order to allow for better build planning. Sometimes, just increase in magic damage might not warrant the increased MP cost. - Include what stats do in the tutorials list, again, for better understanding of which stat to build from. No need for the standard MMO formula, just show that it 'increases max HP, increases HP regen' or whatever. Just basic text info. The formula should rightfully remain in the wiki for those who are curious even further. - The miscellaneous stats, like magic amplification and block rate, should also be explained like in the first point. - Include the name of the songs played while entering a new room at a corner somewhere on the screen. Will really help those who admire the music like me to get into the game more.",

            "review_text": "Note: This is a review based on a connection from east coast Australia on already shaky connections to servers.  TL:DR  There are issues with lag for me, that were made worse by shaky servers. Class balance was off, especially with classes that where objectively better than another. Mana and mana regen were really scarce, which makes class balance worse. It's a pretty looking and it sounds quite nice as well. I recommend if you don't get lag issues (or you can stand it).   After playing in the CTB2 beta, my opinion of this game was not very high. The majority of this is due to the bad connection between me and the server. The latency was so bad, that I could have been out of a boss's tell for .5seconds and still get hit by it. This is also exemplified by the fact you are stuck in auto attack animations that you fired off. So it could be that you fired an attack off, .1 of a second later a tell appears but .1 second after that you are then stuck in a attack that you can't move from leaving you stuck in an attack that you couldn't dodge. There may be ways of attack canceling but I didn't play around to find out.  Besides that; The art style for this game is greatly pleasing. It really is just nice to look at, and the majority of it is smoothly animated. The pieces that aren't as smoothly animated do tend to be a bit jarring but often it isn't completely over the top. This game is a good looker and I sure as hell didn't mind staring at it the entire time.  Gameplay wise, this game is good. Not spectacular though. Once again, the game has problems with latency (further made an issue with servers). Only your movement didn't seem affected by latency while attacks and skills are. This leads to a lot of jumps with the character as it has to correct it's position to where the attack/skill actually went off at.  Fighting was really satisfying, however mana and mana regen is extremely low in this game. This makes it so every character needs to rely on their auto attack between chugging mana potions. At the time of CTB2, the only truly viable solo character, once again especially with lag, was the swordsman. This was mainly because the swordsman (barbarian class) had a skill that could 3 shot quite a lot of bosses making the experience much much easier than any other class. That brings on the next issue, class balance at CTB2 was quite horrid in my opinion. I can't speak from mid-late game, but early game there are some really big balance issues, especially with the archer class not having any piercing benefits (even though they are piercing type). I'll leave it there before making a fool of myself though. Leveling is alright, although with plans to drop exp bonuses it might become quite grindy to level even early game. If you like that great, but if it's too slow to me after launch, I might as well play other games rather than grind. The best part is the classes in which it allows you to choose your own path and take skills that you want. You could say play a defensive archer and have that work etc etc. However as mention before class balance is off, and there were clearly better choices in classes you should pick at the time.  Storywise? Eh it was ok, nothing truly great, but enough to keep you going. Most quests however are not shown to the player. You actually needed to ask people, this is up to you whether or not you find it good. The bad part is, NPC's will not tell you if you are too low for a quest they have, meaning you could accidentally skip quests and end up behind the curve for levelling.  Soundwise, it was quite good. I've forgotten most of how it actually sounded, but if I remember correctly the music was a nice sub genre of electronic. One thing however. Sound was orientated depend on whatever direction your character was looking rather than the direction of the screen. A very awkward design choice there. (May not be the case for 2 channel audio)  Do I recommend this game? If it isn't laggy, go straight for it and see if you like the grind. If it is laggy, you may get frustrated like me and end up quitting because of the amount of BS that you couldn't control without going overly out of your way to correct.",

Also the game doesnt spoon feed people the side quest doesnt have icons over them like the main quest does u have to explore and talk to npcs to fines which one gives u quest(which isnt to hard tho some people might disagree) this is something i personally like.  TOS is a quite fun game once u take the time to understand it. U Should do research What classes u want and Look and Lvling guides cause it can be punishing at times.Cause u to work harder to lvl. ToS Shouldnt Be compared to or treated like RO this is not RO This Is TOS some people need to get that. If u enjoyed Old School RPGs like The Mana Series etc give ToS a try.  Great game tho it can be troublesum at times i love it 10/10 cant wait to play some more.",

Someone said something the other day stating this game has really only been out for only less than a month. That's significant! I'm going to say let's go for it and hope for the best. I'll continue to update.  EDIT 2: Playing the game involves grinding. You can't grind when hordes of bots steal the dwindling numbers of potential kills. The potential kills that don't respawn for minutes at a time. Take for example, my favorite - nonexistant - item in the game: The Panto Spearhead dropped by a Large Panto Spearman.  Know who has the largest number of kills of Large Panto Spearmen on Orsha? I do. Probably shy of 500 over a period of 8 days of farming upwards of 6-8 hours at a time. At first it was sickening, fighting hundreds of people to steal the kill over 8 channels. Then 8 channels became 6 channels. Then bots flooded back into the game and suddenly the potential kills are all gone. This is only Level 35 content here. Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? You think I'm going to forge ahead for the last 465 levels of torturous content? I enjoy a grind, hell yeah I played the living HELL out of RO but I don't enjoy this. Don't stop by. Don't waste your time. And good god when free to play opens up their already limited servers are going to ignite.

It has a lot of classes that you can play, making it a pretty versatile mmorpg (even though the classes don't have that much of skills to upgrade), and each class has a specific clothing that you can change back to, even when you upgrade to a new class, if you like the older one more. It has this aspect of customization that is pretty nice.   The crafting, gems and etc system can be a bit confusing at the beginning, but it is also easy to use. It is not a very complex system, so those that really like crafting systems will probably feel a bit disappointed here (I didn't, but I still have to say that because I know that some people are really into this kind of thing).  The spells system is pretty straightforward, although the classes that use too much mana may feel a bit overloaded by the enemies, since their mana will go too fast and they won't manage to beat the monsters by pure sheer force. Classes like the Cleric are actually good to play alone, because it won't spend that much mana, be tanky and still have a bit of strength so they can continuously attack the enemy.  The game is pretty good for beginners, overall, it will help you a lot and also feel pretty easy at the beginning. Although it will be a bit hard later. When you reach certain levels it becomes a huge problem to level up and you will need to grind. I really don't like this aspect of the game and think it is a cheap way to make it bigger, specially since, in this game, you'll reach huge levels like 200 level and more than that. You shouldn't need to spend a whole life only leveling one character, it is more fun to have a lot characters and if you want to level each one to the 'max', it will take a whole lot of time.  But, the game is fun. And also pretty. Since it is a F2P game, you can play it for a while and leave when you want to. So I can't not recommend it.",

The Bearkaras Fragment was restored to my inventory and I have started to play the game again.  Though there are remaining issues with the game as detailed by others in their reviews, I now feel comfortable recommending this game.   Original review fiollows:  I purchased the Founders Server: Exclusive Access 1 DLC and played the game to reach around level 80. The game is enjoyable for the most part but seems to have some major design flaws. I have stopped playing the game due to one of these flaws.  The major problems I experienced with the game are:  1. Support: I could not find a way to contact a GM or open a trouble ticket in game. I had to go to the website to submit a ticket. To submit a ticket or post on the forum, you have to login with a Facebook or Google+ account. Your Google+ user name is displayed in the forum post it you login using your Google+ account. I was able to receive a response when submitting a problem report via Email but it appears TOS support has ceased all Email responses.  2. Boss Item Drops: Many of the bosses can only be fought a single time and they provide a unique drop when defeated. Many of these unique item drops are necessary for recipes to create items critical to character progression. This is all well and good until, as in my case, one of these unique items fails to drop when a boss is defeated. My problem is that the Bearkaras Fragment was not received when I defeated Bearkaras (I defeated this boss around level 80). I am not able to craft the Zachariel Bangle which effectively results in my character status being 15 levels below normal. I consider the lack of the Zachariel Bangle such a detriment that the game is not worth playing any longer.   3. Inability to resolve issues: When I discovered I was missing the Bearkaras Fragment, I opened a support ticket. I did receive an answer that the information was being forwarded to the developers to prevent occurrences of a similar problem in the future. I did not receive any indication that the missing item would be restored in my inventory so a followed up with a forum post in the Game Bugs area asking if I could expect the missing item restored or the quest reset. I have not received a response to my forum post to date. I finally wrote an Email to the TOS support that included a copy of the forum post and ticket text. I also included screenshots to show I defeated the boss but didn't have the fragment in my inventory. I have not received a response to this Email.  I consider the game unplayable without the Zachariel Bangle and am disappointed as I was hoping to play the game at higher levels. I believe I have done my utmost to resolve the issue but have not received the appropriate response from TOS support.  I cannot at this time recommend the game due to the problems I've encountered. I will update this post if this situation changes.",

It seems like the game was meant to hype up and grab cash then GTFO.  things i didnt mention. -commanderload fail -empty or overfilled servers leading to disconnects -large silversinks and not enough weays to make silver -grinding is terrible compared to other grinders youve played before. -males cannot have beards and look like 6 year olds in the body of a midget. -items are not seen on your character outside of weapons and most weapons are recolors reskins -you cannot crossdress female male costumes nor do youve a wide choice of skins / Looks -everyne is the same with slight differences the 80 classes is an illusion youve a moneymaker class or a pve / pvp class -pvp is a joke and is never going to succeed with current archer wizards clerics swordsman imbalance , no seriously its just dumb and unimaginative filled with 1hkos and massive cc. -i am sad becuase i had high hopes for this but i reached the 5th stage of mourning which is acceptance.  save yourself from tree of savior and save your money until its polished if it will be ever.",

            "review_text": "After F2P release, from an early access player perspective, the game has all the potential to be a good game, but IMC's omission and bad game/server/bot/forum management makes it quite hard to play. Up to date, players in Brazil need to use a VPN in order to connect to the server seeded in SP - Brazil. No response from IMC regarding all the connection and queueing issues, apart from 'we are currently aware of some generic issues and trying to find a solution' and 'hey, players, how about trying to connect through other channels besides channels 1 and 2?'. The last scheduled maintenances only corrected minor image and icon bugs, nothing substantial to increase playability. Many players still stuck on limbo (aka lodge) in SA server. All things considered, I maintain this negative analysis.",
