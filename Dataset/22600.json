            "review_text": "I don't think I've ever played a game more irreverent and wacky in its humor and design while also keeping to one of the most accurate and precise physics engines I've seen in a while.  Worms Reloaded is actually an updated rerelease of Worms 2: Armageddon  (Do not confuse this with Worms: Armageddon. They're actually two totally different games)  released in 2009 and while it's one of the older titles in the Worms franchise, it is definintely the one with the most features, gameplay modes, options, and overall fun out of the games I've played.  Up to four teams each control a squad of four worms with customizable names, voices, and hats (in fact the Steam version has TF2-themed hats just for this occasion) and an arsenal of weapons ranging from rocket launchers, grenades, flamethrowers, and air strikes to ninja ropes, teleporters, and magnets to a variety of exploding wildlife and grandmas to the mighty meteorific field-wide death of Armageddon. These worms will use said weapons to blow the living hell out of each other in a manner befitting old-school Looney Toons designed by Michael Bay. Each worm only has a finite amount of time to make a move, inch across the battlefield, use whatever weapon or item they wish and end their turn. A surprsing amount of things can get done during this time, but moves must be planned very carefully as just about any situation can be used against you somehow if your opponent is creative enough.  The controls on the weapons are all fairly simplistic but at the same time surprisingly complicated. The physics engine is very in depth taking into account, angle, power put behind the shot or throw, wind power and direction, and the presence of any obstacles. The precision in which things can be done is fairly impressive and a competent player can do things that might not even seem possible. It is worthy to note while keyboard controls are present, a controller is generally recommended for this game due to how strange buttons are mapped originally, but this can be changed. Gravity effects everything BUT the terrain you're standing on. The randomly generated maps and backgrounds will stay put no matter how many pieces are blown apart until you're either sitting in a crater, traverssing tunnels, or recreating Bastion. However, even a remaining pixel can be the difference between a hit or a miss in some cases so keeping track of what was destroyed how can sometimes work to your advantage but freak accidents can always happen.  One thing that's consistent throughout any worms game, especially in multiplayer, is that no matter how good one side is compared to the other, random chain reactions and other assorted problems can show up as a result of anything happening. A grenade could be thrown and throw an enemy worm into a mine, which detonates a nearby gas canister that lights an area on fire that eats through the ground and frees up a hole for someone else to fall into- right onto a health crate that fell down previously. But by no means is this a luck-based game. Freak happenings aside, the mechanics, complex physics, and sheer creativity allowed in the vast arsenal of weapons and tools requires quick reflexes, careful planning, and a good knowledge of how the game works and mastering these can take quite a bit of practice.  While this game is best played with friends, the single-player campaign is long and full of missions ranging from puzzles to challenges, to simply difficult missions and the AI at later levels is surprsingly advanced given how complex the rest of the game is. Unfortunately, the campaign isn't really worth playing more than once as each mission has a special 'trick' to it that can render it fairly easy in the hands of a skilled player. The actual multiplayer is where most of the action is. Randomly generated landscapes of a variety of colors, themes and backgrounds from ancient Egypt to Hell to outer space never makes for the same game twice and customizable maps and game modes allow for more exacting factors to be controlled ahead of time should you wish it. Due to the antics of how the game works, I recommend you play with actual friends either in person (It's worth noting that local multiplayer only needs a single controller) or online, but online multiplayer is also a perfectly viable option. Fair warning to those who care, however: There is no word censor in this game and enemy team or word names you come across online can be inappropriate.  Overall this is a fantastic multiplayer game that, if plugged into a large monitor, projector, or TV can make a fantastic couch party game that doesn't rely heavily on the RNG, but has just enough chance to allow laughs at a chain of explosions due to a misplaced land mine. There's enough customization to keep games from getting boring or samey and custom teams are always fun to deal with and it's very easy to personify the little guys and give each of your team a distinct personality or strategy type in your head. The single-player allows for a lot of time invested and makes for good practice and a rewarding experience by itself. Still, only get this game if you plan on playing it with friends.",

From the basic Bazooka to the Holy Grenade and the awesome Banana-Bomb. If you don't know Worms, just know that this game is one of the best local-Multiplayer-Games out there. The Campaign is ok and packs some challenges, but you basically buy this game for all the joy and frustration you will cause you and your buddys. The Presentation is nice, funny and timeless, but i can't emphasize this enough: Play it with your Friends, they'll love/hate you for it^^",

New weapons, new graphics, more diverse campaign missions, and more customization (hats, victory dances, worm colour on top of added sound banks) definitely see the worms franchise moving forward.  However, like I said, I'm a hardcore Worms Armageddon (1999) player and the gameplay mechanics (or the engine, I guess?) has been overhauled and it's just not the same for me. Also, teams can only have a max of 8 worms and the in depth scheme customization that I'm used to isn't present.  If you're new to the Worms series, I'd definitely recommend this game. However, I go back to the old Worms Armageddon to get my fix. I'll keep poking my way around this new one though, as I'm sure there are some pleasant surprises in store for me.",

            "review_text": "If you've never played a Worms game before, WHAT THE CRAP, MAN?! STOP READING THIS AND BUY IT NOW!!  If you have played a Worms game before, this is one is still a blast. I played Worms Armegeddon when it came out, installed it on my high school's network harddrive so that every student who logged on could access it and play wonderfully silly local games. And, boy, did we. All the time. And you could hear cursing and laughter throughout the computer lab (followed by everyone alt-tabbing or turning off the computer monitor when a teacher came over to question what we were doing).  Almost fifteen years later, Reloaded has been brought back all that hilarious joy that's definitely on par with Armageddon. Local and online multiplayer is wonderful. Lots of cursing and laughter with friends (we don't have to hide it from any teachers this time). And really this is why you buy this game. Hilarious, goofy weapons to blow up your friends and curse/laugh when you fail miserably and accidentally blast yourself to smithereens.   What? You're still reading? All right, I can say more. Good things: -Steam Achievements: a ton of achievements that make you work (some are ridiculously hard). -Multiple platforms: I play on Mac and Windows both. It's nice to have an option. IMPORTANT NOTE: You cannot play across platforms online (I have to play on my Windows laptop when playing with friends since most of them don't have a Mac). -Map Editor is fun.  Some Blah things: -The single player campaign is nice but it felt a bit short. For a really great extended Solo experience, you'll want to buy the DLC or the Game of the Year Edition. (GOTY includes all DLC and provides some excellent challenges.) -A LOT of Steam Achievements are linked to the DLC, so you'll have to purchase them separately or the GOTY Edition to get all of them. BUT DLC only works for Windows. So even when buying GOTY Edition, you can only play the base game on Mac and Linux.  The game is worth the money at full price, but it goes on sale pretty often, so I recommend keeping an eye open to snag the game for $5 or better. (~$6.50 for GOTY)",

There are Mac and Linux ports, but don't fool yourself - you can ONLY play with people who run the same OS as you. Yes, there are 'work arounds' (if we're being honest, they're more like extreme measures) such as WINE and multi-booting. I'm told also that the DLC doesn't work on the Mac and Linux ports (at best) and may even cause the game to simply fail to run (at worst).  This, combined with the apparently laissez-faire attitude of the dev team (which extends to the newer issuance in the series as well, it seems), makes this game (and other T17 post-1990s releases) a poor choice for your wallet-votes.",

It was the first Worms outing for Steam, and repaying homage to the 2D classics of Worms; but has curiously seemed to have taken a step backwards. Quite frankly, if you want good a 2D venture - Worms Armageddon is the one to get!  The mechanics are largely identical to the classics. They've added a few new interesting weapons (such as the Sentry Gun / Bunker Buster) but by the same hand have taken away several good'uns too (French Sheep Strike, Homing Pigeon, minigun...) - which I find a very perculiar choice to have made. I find the worms also look visually worse than before; and the menu is also quite drab and clunky (lots of text, several levels of sub-menus and no tool-tips) The campaign is also very disappointing and lacks the puzzles / challenges we saw before  Quite frankly - Now that the more formidable Worms Armageddon is back on Steam (and remastered): Get that one instead!
