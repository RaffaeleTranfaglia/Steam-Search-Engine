            "review_text": "What can I say about Ziggurat, one of many recent rogue-lites released on Steam? Well, for one thing, it's actually pretty good. In fact, I would go as far as saying that it's one of the best rogue-lites that you can buy on Steam. Though it borrows a lot from other rogue-lites (which in turn borrow a number of key concepts from actual rogue-likes), it also has some Heretic and Hexen thrown in, and not just in terms of visuals, but also in terms of gameplay.   The gameplay of Ziggurat is quite simple. It's a combination of a rogue-like dungeon crawl mixed in with an FPS. Along the way, you will be leveling up your character, dying from enemy fire, unlocking new perks and weapons (as well as the occasional character), and starting from ground zero all over again. When it comes to basic FPS mechanics, the game does everything correctly, and the controls are also well tuned. The perks in this game range from your basic 'magic meter increase' and 'better healing' to perks that can negatively impact one aspect of your character while improving another aspect of your character, which may or may not ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up. In addition to these perks, there are also rooms your character can pray at to gain temporary and permanent perks in the form of 'divine blessings', although these same statues can also give you 'divine punishment', which affects your character negatively, or a divine indifference, which affects you in both a positive and negative way. These statues can also refill your health or mana meters and give you new items. Although you will probably never be able to use or find all the weapons in the game in a single playthrough (assuming you managed to unlock all the weapons in the game), I was quite surprised over how many weapons there are in the game. There are four primary weapon types, and although the usefulness of some of these weapons is debatable, most of the weapons I have used have helped me in my playthroughs in one way or another. As far as characters go, you only have one to play with in the beginning, though you unlock more as you complete certain prerequisites. Each character has some variation in between then, with one character being the 'balanced' type, while another character being the 'speed demon' type, and some characters might be proficient in either one or more magic types. However, the gameplay still remains very similar even when playing other characters. The level system in this game is pretty basic, as it increases your mana pool and your HP and then has you chose a perk. Of course, there is an aspect to it that irks me, and that aspect is not being able to directly chose what perks you want. In fact, each time you upgrade a character, you have two perks to chose from (three with the help of an unlockable perk), and those perks are randomly chosen. Why does this irk me? Well, its probably because it doesn't allow for total control of your character in terms of character progression. I understand that rogue-likes certainly have a luck factor, and I also understand how some of that luck factor carries over into rogue-lites. However, contrary to popular belief, not every factor in a rogue-like is based on luck, and yes, that includes character building (assuming the rogue-like lets you control what your stat points and/or skill points go into, which a lot of rogue-likes do). This to me feels like a half-♥♥♥♥♥ attempt at character building with player input. Either give me full control of what perks and skills I can learn and/or give me full control of where I can put my stat points into, or don't give me full control of those options at all. Also, the traps are kinda lame, as they are not that difficult to pass through once you get their patterns down.  In terms of presentation, optimization and sound, Ziggurat is mostly good. The graphics are very solid, and most of the character models are pleasant to look at. The game also manages to be pretty well optimized, and has some essential settings. The only thing that I didn't like too much in this category is the sound, as the music is quite meh.   Even though the game has a number of quirks, Ziggurat is a well put-together rogue-lite that is definitely worth checking out if you're looking for a very good rogue-lite fix, and fans of FPS games and actual rogue-likes might enjoy this as well.",

            "review_text": "First-person shooter roguelikes are one of those things that sound awesome and obvious, but are actually incredibly difficult to do well. FPSes are built around carefully-crafted encounters where enemies can present interesting challenges for the player to overcome, so randomizing those elements leaves a lot of room for missteps. The developers behind Ziggurat somehow found a way to make it all work, and wrapped it up in a clean, colorful package that is almost impossible to put down.  The titular ziggurat is an ever-changing magical labyrinth that serves as the final (and potentially fatal) exam for your mage guild. Armed with only your trusty wand, you must descend through five sprawling floors of monsters and treasure to defeat the guardian and claim your place as a proper wizard. Defeating monsters (and exploring, on occasion) earns you experience that lets you pick a perk when you level up, which can range from a simple stat boost to a permanent mutator on your movement or attacks. There's a lot of space for different builds if you get the right cards, providing some welcome variety even on the same character. Even better then that there are a dozen different characters to unlock and choose from, each with even more dramatic differences right from the start.  And that's just your character! There's a huge assortment of weapons to find, spread across three different archetypes. You have spellbooks, which usually have short-range shotgun-style area effects, staves, which tend to be more accurate and rapid-fire, and alchemy, which covers all sorts of guns and grenades. Every level is guaranteed to have one random weapon and you can only hold one of each type, so a big part of the strategy is forming a complimentary arsenal out of your limited, randomized options. There are also amulets that provide powerful, sporadic effects, and shrines that can provide limited bonuses in exchange for certain sacrifices. The more you play, the more perks, weapons, and amulets get added to the pool, and after a dozen hours there's still plenty more for me to find.  So there's plenty of variety on your end, but what about the enemies? You'll encounter two dozen flavors of fanciful, murderous creatures on each run, as well as an assortment of challenging bosses. Pretty much any attack pattern you can imagine is represented, and enemy groups can be mixed all sorts of ways. Then there are champion monsters that are faster or have special auras, and room effects that boost EVERYONE'S damage or cause visual effects. Levels should take about 10 minutes each to finish, give or take depending on how much exploring you do. Part of that decision is going to be based on how you're holding up, because one bad combination of enemies can really mess you up... the rooms are all arena-style, so once you enter, you're not leaving until you wipe 'em all out.  With such a huge volume of content, Ziggurat is a shooter that can last you dozens of hours. The wide variety of characters, perks, weapons, and enemy groups to use them on will keep you busy for ages, and there are difficulty levels and daily challenges on top of all that. The bright, colorful fantasy graphics and rich sound are the perfect icing on this enormous cake. If modern roguelike Heretic sounds like a good time to you, and there's no reason it shouldn't, pick this one up as soon as you can.",

            "review_text": "The game was most fun the first time I played it. Afterwards I found the last boss to be unfair and the re-clearing of the rooms to be tedious. It looks great and is fast paced but I just don't enjoy playing it - even for a short dash.  The movement and aiming is fun and very satisfying however .. how can I show my skill, kite and abuse my freeze gun if some of the enemies have a burst/leap or cannot be frozen. This results in me running in circles and firing until my ammo is empty. And believe you me, using the basic wand is as much fun as shooting a tank in BattleField with a pistol.  I do understand the properties of a rouge-like game. However... most of the time I don't even have all three guns (i.e. max equipment) or only get the ones I already have. Finding the right ammo is random. Sometimes you just cannot win.  So far, I found the cards (skills or power-ups) you get for a level-up quite uninspired: more hp, more ammo, more xp, change ammo reservoirs ... I feel there was so much potential for interesting mods or trade-offs. Maybe you have to unlock them, however I don't intend to grind just to see it getting slightly better.  I think it is worth a try for 50% off (7,50€). I don't really regret buying it, although I'm not happy with it.  EDIT: 27.10.15 After some patches I dropped by again. Still disappointed by the dull perks. Unlocked new characters, however, e.g. it says 'learns faster than others'. Instead of simply telling you the characters starts with 'scholar' on lvl 4. The descriptions are all vague and give you no information to decide upon. Overall it feels better, maybe caused by balance patches. Still looks great. Still having no real fun with this.",

This game, while glossy and pretty, is fairly uninspired and rote.",

The pacing is pretty hectic, but once you clear a room you have time to resituate . I could easily see this as a retail game. Also, the game gets updated pretty regularly, with fixes and new content. Some people might complain that it is short, but they have added an Endless option to difficulty, which I assume means what it says (I have not tried it yet). This is the best thing I have played in a very long time, and it has plenty of replay value to satify those skeptics who think it might be too short. As of 3/8/15 it is on sale, and I highly encourage anyone to pick it up. Even once it isn't on sale, I still think it will be worth it. I can't wait to see what these developers do next!",

One person though made a pretty clear point about this game: the levels are not many, only 5 floors to beat the game (and yeah they are longer and bigger if you compare them to games like Isaac); the spells you get are just 'hidden guns' they are not spells that you would expect from a game like this.

Movement is very sensitive. -The weapon types (Wand, Staff, Spells, Alchemy) are all varied and interesting to use in different situations -Difficulty is pretty high but not impossible, it feels fair while still being a great challenge  My favorite thing about this game is the replay value. Each time you start a new game, the dungeon is randomly generated. Rooms can have different effects (weakened monsters, more xp, etc) and trap rooms with floating lava or treacherous spike traps are fun.

There are a bunch of characters to unlock, some of which drastically change the way you have to play the game.  The first thing a friend told me when I reccommended this game to him was 'Ugh... The graphics are so...' I feel like the graphics have their own little charm, and to say that a game should be judged by it's graphics is like saying World of Warcraft should have far less players than it does.

But if you were to point out that it uses random enviroment generation, ammunition resource management, a perk/item system like what The Binding of Isaac does, it would raise its hands and start trying to get as many words out of its mouth against that argument. It depends on how closely you adhere to the Berlin Interpretation of what a Roguelike is.  But what Ziggurat is banking on is its FPS gameplay. And I think it does it about 75% well - the gameplay reminded me of classic Serious Sam/Painkiller action, which is pretty damn great for a game made in nine months. The level design sucks like a hoover, though. I am not a fan of randomly generated level layouts for FPS games - they're an alright substitution if you can't sit down and create ten levels by hand, but immersion is my main complaint here. It's not too bad of a flaw, because while I can identify the type of level, the battle largely depends on the type of monsters. A little more variety definitely wouldn't hurt here, though!  I feel the same way about the bosses. 'Hey, mage bro! You sure killed all the monsters in the other nine rooms of this dungeon! Now shoot the bigger monster surrounded by the other monsters and you can go to the next level!' Again, this is fine, but I am getting restless and bored just because the biggest monsters want more punishment before they go down.  It's not a bad game, but it's left me a little wanting. I can't blame the developers for that, they made this damn thing with a four-man team in nine months. What I am surprised by is how solid it is and how well it's managed to scratch that old-school FPS itch. Definitely worth your time.",

            "review_text": "Think Binding of Isaac in 3D. This is basically a randomly connected set of 3D arenas, where you fight fantasy creatures with magical weapons. Throw in the occasional room with a new weapons or gods you can pray to, and the obligatory end-of-level boss that blocks the way to the next floor.  Permadeath is in, so when you're dead, it's game over. The only things that accumulate between runs are unlocked objects that add to the random pool of stuff you can find. So no built-in grinding like in Rogue Legacy or Full Mojo Rampage. However as I unlock stuff some sound really powerful compared to what I found previously, so I'm not 100% sure if the game is designed as a real roguelike, i.e. if you have the knowledge and skill could you possibly finish it on your first run?  The visuals are great with a lot of variety between floors.  If you compare it to Binding of Isaac the game has a lot of the features that make that game so great (even secret rooms), but there's not as much item variety and game-changing stuff to find. It has narrowed the gap with recent updates though.  Compared to classic shooters like Hexen from which it borrowed the combat, it lacks the complex level design and occasional interactive object or puzzle. Rooms once emptied of enemies feel empty.  I dislike that mana, xp and health drops from enemies disappear quite rapidly, but that's a design decision I suppose.  Overall this game has a few flaws but is a lot of fun and will get better if you give it a dozen runs.",

With a dozen characters and tons of perks and weapons to choose from there is plenty of replayability in this short but difficult game. Plenty of enemy variety as well.  Much like Heretic and Hexen you are presented with magical weapons and amulets that to use. Every time you level up or find a secret or chest room you can get a new perk selected from a random list much like Solomons Keep. The game presents you new weapons and secrets every level to keep you constantly trying new things, similar to Binding of Isaac. And every once and a while they will throw an elite enemy your way which has increased stats in some way, just like in Risk of Rain.  This game is a mixture of great ideas all put together perfectly into one package. The only thing I can think of that would make it better is multiplayer support and making the individual characters more unique instead of just giving them a different set of stats and cards. And maybe modding support, to let the community continue to add and expand on this game.",

            "review_text": "----------------------- Motion Sickness Tips -----------------------  When i first started up the game, the first thing that i noticed was the unnatural movement. You have motion blur, zooming while sprinting and above all, your camara wobbels to the left and right when walking. I turned off motion blur right away since this is a bad thing in any FPS game since you want clear view when shooting enemies, and to get good situational awareness. However for the first time i can recall i actualy got sick while playing a game, after a mere 40~ minutes, i started feeling dizzy.  Since not everyone knows what names gamedesigners give to camara changes (with an exepetion of motion blur maybe) i decided to write this to help anyone that finds the previous mentioned anoying or feels sick from it. You can turn all of it off both in the Menu but also while playing.  Go to &gt;Settings&lt; and then &gt;Game&lt;  Here you can turn off the wobbeling of the screen and sprint zooming. Turn off &gt;Vieuw BoB&lt; to stop the screen from wobbeling left and right when moving. Turn off &gt;Spring FOV Change&lt; to stop the screen from zooming in while sprinting. The last option is under &gt;Settings&lt; and then &gt;Graphics&lt;  Here you will find the &gt;Motion Blur&lt; that you can turn off to stop the screen from fading when moving. -------------------------------------- This is not a real revieuw since i have not experienced enough of the game to give you my opinion, however if you have motionsickness from games normaly, this might not be a game for you since it involves quite fast movements. I might come back to this revieuw to give my opinion, otherwise it stands as neutral. Hopefully this was helpfull to anyone that had the same problem as me, or thinks of buying the game.",

I waited a little bit to get it at first because I was worried it was going to be another stinker, but man was I pleasantly surprised.   The game uses a randomly generated dungeon that you crawl through in FPS style blasting your way through rooms of enemies using wands, spells, staves, and alchemy. The combat is fast paced, graphically pleasing, and entertaining everytime you pick up and play. You basically work your way from room to room attempting to find a key that allows you to fight a boss to progress to the next floor. As you go, you level up and collect new weapons/items to help you along the way. Death is permanent, so if you die your back to zero. This is a good thing though, as it keeps the game from getting stale or feeling grindy. There is just enough punishment in death to make you feel like you messed up, but not punish you so much you feel like you won't get back to where you were. You just start a new game and you will be leveling up and slaying baddies again within minutes.  Enemy types are varied and each one brings a different attack strategy and strengths/weaknesses to the table. You will have to constantly be aware of your surroundings and the type of enemies you are being attacked by to survive, always adapting your tactics to what abilities you have in your arsenal and what types of monsters spawned in the room.   One of the things I love most about this game is that you can pick it up and play for 15 minutes, or sit down and play for 2-3 hours and have a great experience either way. You are allowed to save in between floors and the early levels won't take much longer than 10-15 minutes so it works perfectly.  I feel like this game will only get better from here as the devs have already patched this game several times in the short week that I have owned it. They are fantastic and deserve all the credit they have gotten for this game and so very much more! Do them and yourself a favor by picking up this game and reccomending it to everyone you know!   EDIT: upate as of 10/17/15 this game just gets better and better. Every update is lovingly crafted by the devs and adds new rooms, perks, weapons, and enemies. I CANNOT reccomend this game ENOUGH. It is a blast and has easily found itself on the list of my favorite games of all time. I am very close to 100% completing and I have enjoyed every minute of it!

The game can be beaten in a couple of hours but will likely take you longer due to the random nature of the game and the increassing difficulty plus with all the unlockable content there is pretty high level of difficulty  Not a bad game for the price.

            "review_text": "It plays a lot like Heretic/Hexen would if they had Roguelike elements. Map layouts are far more arena-like and not as complex as they were in the classics, though. You must pick from a number of characters (you start with one, but can unlock others) and reach the 5th floor to win, and every floor is randomly generated from a number of pre-built rooms that are then strung together. A floor ends when you beat its boss, and you will need a Portal Key to summon the boss. The game has permadeath and you can only save between floors.  There is a good variety of weapons (the pool grows bigger as you unlock more of them) spread across 4 categories. The first is the basic wand, whose mana (ammunition) replenishes quickly and automatically for all characters. Different characters will have different properties for this starting weapon, such as faster or slower ROF, a differently-styled secondary attack, less or more accuracy. The second class of weapons are books, whose attacks are typically shotgun-like and don't consume too much mana. The third type are staves that function as rapid-fire crowd control weapons, and mostly have a primary attack with good accuracy and a secondary that excels at close quarters, burning through your mana rapidly while firing a barrage of projectiles inaccurately. The fourth and last type are weapons that deal area damage. These are usually firearms or throwable explosives, and often have a steep mana cost per use. Some weapons deal self-explanatory status effects, such as poison, stun, or freezing.  You can find usable amulets that must be recharged (by killing monsters), lore scrolls (these give a large EXP boost) and occasionally perks. You also get to choose between two (or three with the Bookworm perk) random perks on level up. In roguelike fashion, you can find statues in certain rooms that allow you to trade your health or mana (or offer nothing, for a lower chance of success I presume) for a possible bonus. You can get a random effect (Divine Indifference) or even a punitive malus from these statues.  I have thoroughly enjoyed this game so far. The challenge is markedly above average and you can extract many hours of quality gameplay from Ziggurat. The shooting feels tight and fast-paced, and the emphasis on dodging projectiles gives the game an interesting quasi-old-school feel. When I first played this game, I ended up stopping only six hours later, and in my book that's pretty high praise.",

A bit of time in menu systems, and a bit more time optimizing the game and this would be a solid release highly recomended.

Levels have to be more and more numerous, more rooms in each levels etc.   Here all is question of luck (perks, health drop, weapons looted, shrines bless / curse etc... Sometimes after 2 levels you'd better give up and give another try. (if the LUCK based status doesn't start to get boring, otherwise you just go another game that has a real balance / content).  Game is just a competitive ('Let's check my E-fame and see where I place myself in Pantheon '^^) luck based where fun is no point as you hunt for achievements and points like a Donkey Kong contest in a constant struggle versus your own luck. Don't expect dungeon crawler with huge scenario and vasts levels. It's more a solo contest (apparentlly they just gave up with multiplayer feature as they had real bad experience with a previous game... ) where you compete with others thru score and ranking. Not for me for sure.  The ziggurat should be a HUGE temple where apprentice would lost himself, with vasts levels of multiple encounters. Not a 10/15 rooms levels (15 with empty corridors ^^)  4/10 for lazyness and randomness that should add some variability in game and not be THE pillar of the game.

This is one of the design issues with roguelikes and they haven't solved it here. How are you supposed to get better at fighting a boss if you only get to make one attempt every hour? This is fine in a turn based roguelike because you have all the time in the world to think, but in an FPS you don't have time to process everything so it really hinders learning a bosses patterns.

Wouldn't it be nice if they built one around fun gameplay rather than mediocrity or super extreme fiddly RPG mechanics.  Then suddenly Ziggurat appears. Not the first roguelike FPS but this one nails the Doom feel. Lots of stafing, dodging bullets, a decent variety of guns. All wrapped up in a lovely fantasy motif that no game seems to want to truck with these days outside of a mindless clickfest RPG or Skyrim, but I repeat myself.  Fight enemies, collect weapons, level up and get random perks. Unfortunately, the game is hugely swingy on randomness, par for the genre. If you get awful perks or weak weaponry you likely won't see the end of the game so it's not something I would call a 'serious' game right yet. If I lose, I think part of that is the game's fault because of all this randomness. Plus, the late game monsters have so much health that the game loses the joy of the early levels and just becomes tedious 'hold mouse button against health bars.'  That said, it reminds me of Doom and any game that can do that is on the right track. Easily the best roguelite I've played but that isn't saying much. I still cannot recommend it. It's fun for a while but it just doesn't hold up in the long run.",

Ziggurat has instantly become my favorite game of the year. I've been looking for a Rogue-lite to capture my attention and entertain me and now I'm absorbed.  Game Features: - Numerous different unlockable Mages to to play. Each Mage has unique starting attributes and unique firing types for the different weapons in he game. - Four different types of weapons (Wand, Spells, Staff, Alchemy) with each weapon type also having different sub-types which not only do different types of damage but also deliver the damage in a unique way. - Multiple different rooms of type, sizes and design. Rooms with large horizontal space, vertical space, mazes, lots of nooks, traps, hazards, etc ...  - Interesting progression options and power-ups in the form of Amulets and Shrines.  So far I have enjoyed every minute spent in the game.",

An issue this game has when compared to other rouge-like games such as ‘The Binding of Isaac’ or ‘Enter the Gungeon’ is a lack of a feeling of constant progression. In the previously mentioned examples you feel as though you are constantly unlocking useful items and areas even when constantly failing. In Ziggurat, you unlock items at the end of your runs, but they don’t feel impactful. This lack of impact permeates the whole game. The level up bonuses feel insignificant (slightly more mana or health for example) and won’t ever effect the way you play the game. The same could be said of many of the weapons with few having a big impact on enemies leading to them feeling more like peashooters than effective weaponry.   But as I said at the start the game is fun and you can sink a few hours into it easily. If you are dying for a first person rouge-like experience then this is probably one of the best you will find. It just doesn’t stand up to other non fps games in the genre.",

You can't learn and master layouts because it is procedurally generated.  Procedural generation feels like it adds nothing, because the levels feel the damn same each time I try them. (Mind you, maybe the levels get better and more complex as you progress, but I could not be damned to get past level 2)  You can't jump and sprint at the same time. Don't even try and defend that.  You can't meaningfully dodge. Jumping can be used sorta sometimes, and you circle around the rest of the time.  The visual design is very tiresome in very little time.  There's the half life spitters and they are not well disguised.  Points for: People nostalgic for a game as objectively ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as Doom will like it. (PS. don't attach your ego to a game, please) ",

If you die, the game restarts (except for unlocked characters).   Health is a rarity.

Secondly, if you die even ONCE you have to start over from level one with no additional skills. Huge turnoff seeing as how there isn't a tutorial or even hints on how to play. Got to level 4 died once to a lava jump puzzle and had to start all over again. Whats the point of playing this game if you can't progress. Granted I've beat DS on NG+7 so if I invested the time I could probably beat this game. But the fact of the matter this game isn't quality enough for players to invest more than a casual interest into it. Let's not forget that the actual FPS part of it.. shooting is not bad but not ahh accurate. You shot in one spot on a mob standing perfectly still and it decides to become a curve-ball style shot.

Attempt to survive the Ziggurat, making your way through five floors, challenging the boss at each to open the way to the next.   Enemies slain yield XP gems that can be used to gain levels, but time sensitive pickups discourage meek play. Every level you gain your choice of a perk, chosen from between a random selection of two perks. These perks can radically effect play, and a choice that doesn't synergize well with your playstyle may spell your doom, or radically empower you. The incredibly disfunctional or amazing builds that emerge from this system make continued runs through the Ziggurat feel very different, giving some nice legs to a game that technically speaking, has only a moderate amount of content.   New weapons, perks, and characters are unlocked simply by playing, and even a very poor run will likely yield a few new perks and a weapon. This system rewards persistence as well as skill, even if you can't make it to the last floor your attempts may pave the way for an eventual success, making the game less hopelessly frustrating than most games with rogue-like elements.   Very fun, stylish, and competently put together, Ziggurat has a lot to love for a very reasonable price.",

The first time I ran through on Easy, as the Apprentice character I was like 'Cool, like an updated Heretic.' Perks were nice, the weapons well-designed, the levels were interesting, with the occasional modifier keeping them from getting too monotonous... then I died...  And I unlocked about 6 more items... Next go through, got a bit deeper, died, unlocked about 8 more items, including a new weapon. Played through again, died near the end, unlocked another 8 or 9 items...   The further you go, the more you unlock, the more you unlock the deeper the gameplay, the deeper the gameplay the further you'll go.   It's the details, the literally dozens, over a hundred unlockables, the various classes which tweak the gameplay, the variances in the various randomized weapons. The need to modify your play-style based on the randomness of your drops, the spawns, and your perks. It's what made the original ASCII rogue so cool, yes each game was a new experience, but the randomness ensured it was practically A WHOLE new experience, Pleasurable replayability isn't just a cool feature, it's an absolute necessity in this game.   Not too many 'Cons' here - bosses could be a little more unique, Cephus is pretty much the only one that truly feels like a boss, all the others just feel like Ultra-Rare Elites of regular mobs (though Audrey is fun too). My only other complaint would be some form of cooperative multiplayer... or even a massive deathmatch where you're not just competing against the monsters but each other. Only 1-life each, if you die you have to wait until someone exits the level and 'wins' that round. Sure the 'King of the Hill' would be higher level than everyone as when you die you go back to level one, but that would just encourage everyone else to do a little 'head-hunting.' Just a thought that would make the game more interesting, though straight-deathmatch in randomized dungeons, team deathmatch, and regular coop (with scaling enemies Serious Sam-style) would also be awesome.   Again asking for MP in what is essentially a single player game may be nit-picking in the extreme, but this game is so well-made otherwise, it's tough to find any other faults.  A+++ rating.

Ziggurat is a great throwback to the days of the glowing green crossbow...  A mix of frentic shooter and proc-gen 'rogue-lite', the game outs you into the robes of a trainee spellcaster entering the titular Ziggurat, an ever-changing structure that serves as the final test for your order- survive that thing, and you're a full mage. If you played Binding of Isaac or anything similar, the core mechanic will feel very familiar- you enter a room, the doors lock on you, and then it's shooting stuff until everything except you is dead. Rinse and repeat; occasionally you'll also come across treasure rooms, bonus-granting statues and challenge rooms that put a nice little goody into the centre of a trap.  You always start with a wand, a weak but reliable fallback weapon, and you'll randomly find additional weapons divided into three classes, each with their own unique setup. Spells, staves and alchemic 'firearms' consume mana from a finite pool, while your wand constantly recharges. Level-ups grant you perks that alter the game's feel significantly, allowing you to recharge health by breaking stuff, being faster, specializing on a weapon type and more- it's always randomized so each run through the Ziggurat feels pretty different.  The game itself isn't that 'long'- beating the Ziggurat once, however, is nothing, as you constantly unlock more stuff: Weapons, perks, character classes, there is a huge pool of things to unlock by wreaking havok.  And that is the most important thing: The game *feels* very great, and you *will* come back to challenge yourself again just to dish out magicks and feel like a badass wizard. Combat is precise and crisp, enemy types are aplenty, each with their own behaviour. There could be a bit more feedback on damage; you more or less know that an enemy is dead exactly the moment he drops to the floor, but that's about it, there's good oomph to the weapons and the game generally looks pretty amazing, with a somewhat cartoonish high fantasy style and a large amount of fizzy fx. Sound is not too bad either.  This is a game one can easily play through again and again, I feel, and apparently the devs are eager on tweaking and adding to Ziggurat. Just two days after my purchase I saw new room patterns and a new enemy type added, and that *is* service. There's never too many baddies to hurl magic at.  So, deep? Thoughtful? Strategic? Nope. A fast, furious, tight proc gen shooter? Yes indeed!",

NOTE: This is obviously an opinionated review, and as such I'd like to point out that my review is based on my personal experience with this game and most likely will not apply to everyone. Pros: First, the gameplay that is present in this game is extremely fun, precise, and difficult. The game obviously takes a lot of influence from games like heretic and DOOM. If that doesn't mean anything to you, DOOM and Heeretic were basically two games that defined the fps genre (evidenced by the term 'doom clone'). Additionally, it is immediately recognizeable that this game is tough. I died on the first room for my first couple of runs. After a couple of hours I finally beat the game on normal mode. This achievement holds significant weight and the feeling of accomplishment up to this point is amazing. In addition to beating the game, this feeling of accomplishment is tied to unlocking new perks (which are upgrades you can use upon leveling up) and weapons (should be self explanatory unless your an idiot).  Cons: I believe this game suffers from two main problems. For me, a roguelike should reward you as you play and get better. However, when rewards occur too quickly it can not only be overwhelming but also it can diminish the feeling of accomplishment. This is the first problem I believe the game suffers. After beating the game that coveted first time, I began to unlock up to seven things per run. While not necessarily bad, I found it a bit ridiculous when I started experimenting with what I could unlock with horrible runs. At the worst of it I unlocked five things without killing an enemy. The second problem with this game is that the gameplay has no variation. Allow me to explain. There is no duobt that this game contains amazing fps bullet hell gameplay that changes as you unlock more perks and weapons. However, other than those two things, the game doesn't change. The new weapons and perks change up the style of gameplay, but the core mechanic remains the same. Shoot. Kill. Advance. Additionally, the changing interior of the environments and weapons begins to lose its luster after you realize that all of the rooms and enemies are just cookie cutter copies of each other rearranged on the beginning of each level. Summary: This game has truly amazing gameplay heavily based on the frantic fps Hectic and DOOM. The initial feeling of accomplishment for getting better at the unforgiving gameplay is very satisfying. However, the lack of variation and overuse of rewards eventually undermines the the feeling of accomplishment that makes this game great. Overall, I believe this game is still very good and is definitely still worth a buy, but for the reasons stated above won't be a roguelike that I will be able to seriously commit some time to.  Extra: For other roguelikes that I believe are better suited for some serious commitment, I recommend: Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, Magicite, and Tower of Guns.",

Its what you are gonna get here, and if you are interested, don't even waste your time, and buy this game now!  The game has great graphics, with amazing colorful lightning and detailed (and varied) enemies. Sure, it doesn't look like an AAA game, but its one of the best looking Indie games I've ever played. And it deserves a bonus for having some of the best weapon designs in a game (reminds me A LOT of Heretic and Hexen, but with more variety). The sounds are also very good. Nothing is too loud or too quiet in here. The weapons sounds are good and varied, and the music is great, and uses a dynamic system (the music changes whenever you enter a room with enemies in it).  The gameplay is great. The controls are precise and very responsive. They are typical FPS controls, which means you'll feel at home here. But what makes this game shine are the Roguelike elements. The game relies heavily on the randomization. The map is randomly generated, the enemies are placed at random, the weapons you get are all random, the bosses you face are also placed at random... Even the perks you can choose when you level up are random. Speaking of perksm, the game has an enormous variety of them, and every time you play, you unlock new perks. This is a great incentive to play the game again and again. Oh, and let me repeat myself: THE GAME HAS PERMADEATH. I love games with permadeath, and this game is very unforgiving at first, but the more you play, more you'll learn how to keep yourself alive.  Anyway, this game is great. Its challenging, varied, its good looking, has an amazing replayability. There are a few issues here and there (like excessive fog on some levels, some first person platforming...), but there are so many good things here that its hard not to recommend this game.

I just wish it had more of a variety to the weapons and characters. A bigger difference between the weapons to make them feel more distinct. It feels as though the developers put a lot of emphasis on making it fair and balanced to the point that most runs don't feel very different from one another.  But for what it is, its a decent game. The shooting is alright and it is perhaps one of the few roguelikes that do good in full 3D.  Just don't expect to find it interesting after playing it as long as Binding of Isaac.",

            "review_text": "If you like the old school serious sam point and shoot intense FPS shooter with tons of enemies and twitch actions, then you will like this game. Very smooth. Very simple. It works.  It also has the graphical vibe of Orcs Must Die. The shooting component is similar but without the traps and enemies are more focused on you as opposed to hitting the exit. The AI is not complex, many enemies just stand or move around towards you in a predictable pattern/speed. They will shoot patterned shots at you, in mass, that with skill you can avoid. So in some ways this is also like a bullet hell, only as a 3D FPS.  There are bosses that will have unique spells/abilities.  This game is easy to drop into and out of. You don't need a ton of time to play. Overall I would say it is pretty casual. There is no story. No commitment.  You can upgrade your character with light RPG like impacts that have some effect on playstyle. You can also unlock new characters that also effect playstyle. Kind of like orcs must die skill trees really. There are definite things this and orcs must die have identicle. It is a great game, with a distinct feel, like a blend of serious sam and orcs must die is exactly what it is. If you have played both of those games, and liked both of those games, and you mashed them together, then this is it, and you will most likely like this as well.  But because of so many of the identicle components found in orcs must die, I have to deduct a star, even for the price.  Also it crashed on me when another program forced it into window mode just now. And there is no really noticable battle music, although that could be a plus for some, if there is any music, I don't remeber any, and while I didn't notice it detracting from the atmosphere, and generally the sound was good from the minions and spells, I would say the music feels non-existant.  I don't regret the purchase (got it on sale for around $5 I think), it is nice and casual shooter with solid mechanics, nice graphics, and smooth gameplay. I'd say the metascore in the 70's range is accurate.",

            "review_text": "Played 2 hours overall feels good.  You switch between 4 kinds of weapons, and each kind the game offers you several choice. But you can't buy them the weapons are randomly picked in the dungeon, so if you picked a powerful one at the beginning one the whole game became easier.   Everytime you level up you could choose one of two perks. Which gives you more advantage in battle or surviving. Feel like a bit repeated, enemies are limited but I'm only level 10, might be more to discover when I dive more hours. Would be better if the game could indicate where is the portal.  Even normal level is bit challenging.",

Cons:  Only con I have about this game is that I'm pretty sure the devs are done with updating the game and have moved onto newer projects.  Conclusion:  If you like FPSes or roguelikes, this game is a must.",
