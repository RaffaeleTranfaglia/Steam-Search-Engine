            "review_text": "Dishonored is a true memorable game. It does everything right. You have a diverse arsenal of weapons and powers at your disposal in your story of revenge. As Corvo Attano, you put the mask of an assassin in a city tormented by chaos. Your way of dealing with problems will influence the city, since killing will take chaos to new levels or being a pacifist will get you a happy ending. Level design is well thought, so being the good guy is not impossible but rewarding, while being the bad guy is really fun. The chaotic play style is the one where you'll fully enjoy your ablities and their upgrades, but as you progress that way, things get harder, as the game adapts to you to be challenging. Assassinating your targets is fun, but handlling things peacefully is actually more attractive, as you'll deal with fascinating NPC's . If you'll take your time to explore, you'll get to know an engorssing world. Overall, this game is a gem that deserves everyones attention and while it is kind of short(I didn't wanted it to end) the score of 9.4 does it justice.",

            "review_text": "I've been meaning to give this game a try before Dishonored 2 came out. When Bethesda announced that for a limited time you could get this game free with a preorder of Dishonored 2, I pounced on the offer. This game is really fun! The main appeal of it to me was its dynamic story; it can play out with a lighter tone or a very dark tone depending on how many people you kill.   You have a plethora of different ways to kill the enemy, as well as ways to take them down in a nonlethal manner. You can sneak up on them and put a knife in their throat, or you can put them in a chokehold and knock them out. You can blast them in the face with a shotgun, or put them to sleep with a tranq dart. You can summon a swarm of rats and watch them LITERALLY DEVOUR your enemies... or you can stick to the shadows and slip by the enemies entirely. The amount of tactical freedom in this game was staggering, both with how to dispatch your enemies and how to move through the level.   I'm trying to keep this spoiler free, but as a warning if you want the game to play out in a happier way, I highly, HIGHLY recommend you play as nonlethal as possible for the first half of the game (first 3-4 main missions). From what I could tell, the tone of the story was largely determined in that time. I'm rather disappointed with how depressing my story ended up; you are given a warning at the beginning of the game about the consequences of playing highly lethal, but I didn't take it seriously enough. I unleashed utter carnage in the first few missions and killed all of the main targets. After the first few missions I already started to see the negative effects that my actions were having on the story. I decided I needed to change my ways: the whole second half of the game I played very nonlethal, sparing all the main targets and inflicting very few casualties. But it was too late, and the story went spiralling down despite my best efforts to turn things around.  All in all I loved my time in the world of Dishonored, and am REALLY pumped for the second installment!  ",

            "review_text": "'Their fate rests on your effort. On the strength of your hands, and of your heart...'  Arkane Studios and Bethesda really outdid themselves with 'Dishonored'. It's an amazing stealth FPS that'll leave you wanting more.  You play as Corvo Attano, the Empress's Bodyguard and you've just brought news from foreign land in seek of help from the rat plague that has infested the city of Dunwall. Due to unforseen consequences, you are framed and became enemy of the state, hence the title.  The story of the game is not bad, but not great either, although I love the ending that I got. Some parts are predictable while others are unexpected. I do love the fact that your actions affect the outcome of the story. I feel as if I have control over the game and not just following a scripted flow of events. Plus, making wrong/different decisions add drama and tension to the plot which makes you careful in deciding what to do next.    Visuals are smooth and well-made. It's using the Unreal Engine 3 so you'll find it somehow similar to the cartoony nature of Bioshock Infinite, but darker. I honestly prefer the atmosphere of Dunwall to Columbia, for reasons I am not entirely sure of :/ Ambience wouldn't be complete without music, and it fits very well with the visuals. It's by no means the best, but it's just perfect for the game.  Now, I wasn't really a fan of the stealth genre but 'Dishonored' made me think otherwise. It's fun, smooth and rewarding. You wield a sword in one hand and a Charm/Pistol/Crossbow/Trap/Grenades in another. It's kind of confusing to sort them all out, but once you do, it's fast and easy ^_^ Speed and silence is key, this game rewards you for not attacking enemies head-on because once you do, they will outnumber you in a matter of seconds. I love how you can play the game at your own pace, you have to go from point A to point B, but it gives you freedom how to get there e.g. Use the rooftops and go unnoticed by ground forces, or use the shadows to slide past your enemies, or explore the area to find hidden passages. You're given the tools, and it's up to you, how you want to use them.  Overall Experience: This was honestly one of the best games I've played so far. I just love the freedom it gives you in gameplay and the astounding atmosphere it sets you in. You don't need a high-end PC to play this game, it's very well-optimized and that's always a plus for me ^_^ I highly recommend 'Dishonored' even if you're not a big fan of stealth.  Tip: Explore the surroundings..... you'll find untold stories that add to the ambience of the game.",

            "review_text": "Do YOU like loading screens? Well then you're out of luck, 'cos in this game, they're more of a subliminal message flash than a loading screen. I probably didn't even get to read the majority of the loading screen tips.  A very Assassin's Creed-like game, if Assassin's Creed were capable of producing a story you actually cared about.   As predictable as the story can be   (Really, we're achieving all our goals  this  early? That seemed a bit easy, I wonder!)  , I found myself connecting with it, with Corvo, with Emily, with poor, ol' Sam. The game isn't just about calculated choices to achieve ends that I want. I found myself passionately hating certain characters. I felt disappointment when I realised I won't get to put a knife through their eyes. I felt mercy after hearing the tale of another character. And so it goes.   And if you want a bit more challenge, play through the game without killing anyone, or being detected - and not just because of the associated achievements. There's genuine focus and thought necessary to clear out clusters of enemies. Figuring out the enemy patrol patterns, best angles of approach and the timing. Heck, I probably spent a good hour clearing out one part of Flooded District, home to the Assassins. I felt genius anxiety about there being an assassin around the next corner or on the next rooftop, and very overlapping patrols/sightlines.   Overall, it's a great game with a less-than-original story that is presented incredibly well. The combat mechanics aren't the greatest if you just run around with knife and pistol, but once you start being a bit more creative, you can have loads of fun decimating piles of Watch Guards. Just do yourself a favour and reconfigure the combat controls, blocking with Mouse2, Sword attack with Mouse1 and Power/Gadget on a thumb button of preference worked really well for me.",

Truely unique and original ideas by the developers have made this game feel very special and making you feel like a true hero as you take out many important figures using non-lethal ways makes this world really fun to explore, the only criticism i have is that the storyline can be hard to follow because it is SOOO in-depth so if you are playing while listening to music or not concentrating on the story-line you will miss out on a lot of the secret stuff and you will miss the entire point in what you are meant to be doing and why  Thanks Bethesda for the experiance! :D",

Corvo, the empresses bodyguard turned 'Assassin' by a group of loyalists that wish to put Emily, the late empresses daughter, in charge of the kingdom. How you do that however is compleatly up to you.  You will get missions to go Eliminate targets and you can do this by Killing them or 'Removing' them if you are the 'I can't be bothered to use stealth!' type of person you can run in there willy nilly and stab your target or you can be more creative. Poison, choking them out and throwing them into a pack of hungry rats, or using your magic to send them to the moon Or on the flipside, you're the type of person that likes stealth and to be as non-leathel as possible you can find alternitive means to eliminating your targets.  The way you play greatly affects the outcome of the story  This game is increadibly innovative. Good line of sight on guards, fun and interesting ways to kill and neutrilize people, amazing story with charaters you get attached to, combat that makes you think of how you're going to tackle groups of enemies, whilst still being a challenge to the player.  So far I've played this game through to the end 3 times and every playthrough has been different.  If you're browsing through steam for a good game to play at a reasonable price, £7.99 at the time of writing this, I highly recomend this game. ",

You play in first person in a medieval world with magic and science.  You will start a level with at least one goal, sometimes the goals change or you get more goals or you can decide which of the ways to reach the goals you want to use. Mostly it is the decicion: Lethal or not lethal. Inside the level you are free to go where you want.   You can play the whole game like DARK, you try to not to be seen, your only target is the mission goal.  Even if you do so, you can still decide if you kill at all. You WILL be responsible for dead/capture, but you can make it kind of... third parties fault.  The complete different approach is the killing spree. If you use knife, crossbow, pistol, grenades, mines and magic to the fullest extend you can do incredible cool things. You can freeze time and put a grenade in the hand of someone, take a bullet from the air, teleport behind an enemy to strangle him, send rats to eat your enemies alive or blast them against walls. You can take over a fish or another animal and use different routes, take over a human and walk him out of the sight of others, reprogram towers to kill your enemies and so much more.  So you can either play the I-do-not-kill-guy with a good ending or the kill-all-enemies-guys with a bad or at least dark ending.  Either way, the game is fantastic.  I really love the graphics, I love the music and the gameplay is very smooth and fun.  The only thing which is not so good: the character faces are... don't know.. kind of ugly. All of them.

It's not the same game or story but being able to sneak around through a game again is so much fun. No moss or water arrows but that's good because they got to be a bit silly with that.  As it stands, you have a massive number of options for completing your objectives in Dishonored. You like rooftops? You can be Spidey. The sewers and maintenance areas feel more comfortable? Crawl away! The myriad paths and the optional side missions make some of the missions exceedingly long when you don't know the maps but they are still all enjoyable. I can see real opportunities for speed runs when you know exactly where to go but you'd miss so much of the content.   The story is well done and detailed with believable characters though the end is a bit overdone. Even many of the NPCs are almost fully fleshed out with backstories - families, friends etc. You will eventually hear guard conversations repeat simply because you encounter so many of them but it often pays to hang out for a minute and listen to the guards because they are chatting about optional paths or things you are interested in...if you hover around.  All in all, I enjoyed the hell out of Dishonored and strongly recommend to anyone who remembers Thief or the old Metal Gear Solid when it was stealth focused.",

            "review_text": " Agent 47 meets Ezio Auditore and Booker de Witt in  City 18    Again, one of my reviews:   in short  This game blends quite succesfully a  First Person Hitman  experience with the verticality of  Assassin's Creed's Ezio Auditore . There is an evolved version of  Bioshock's Plasmids  which don't just copy the BS ones. The art director is the same as in  Half-Life 2  and sadly sometimes you feel really like in a  City 17  clone a century before. Through a  Low/High Chaos  system, the game ensures that there is a stealth approach, as well as a 'standard' FPS one and provides the enemy spawns needed. It caters to the Fantasy community, but after the first 2 chapters, it is even for someone like me playable. Recommend it, if you like stealth games, though w/o frustration due to supernatural powers and blood &amp; gore approach possibility. Recommend yes, but a 87-90 meta score would have been more than enough: Entertaining and a nice blend but nothing too special; still one of the better games, I guess.   in detail   story  Hm, personally I am not a Fantasy person and not really into empresses, mana and haunted castles, so forgive me being biased towards this game, but as mentioned, I nearly skipped the whole game after meeting the empress and all of that  Outsider 's gibberish. I collected all audio tapes (or  Voxophones ) in  Bioshock , which added greatly to the atmosphere and gave insides. Here, this abundance of audio diaries, notes and books either merely state the obvious or are simply boring ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t which is only loosely connected to the main story. Sometimes hints are buried under these tons of 'paper'. - The overall story is ok though and the characters themselves got personality, just the collectibles are hastily done. Voice-acting itself is brilliant, but the dialogues are flat but getting better towards the end. Background score is another plus.   gameplay  positive:   leaves many options and approaches   even in hardest achievement combo, w/o killing nor alerting anyone, nor using superpowers not frustrating (on  normal )   side quests are well integrated into the main story - this is a huge plus and only the  Half-Life  franchise manages that from what I played so far   few but distinguishable weapons and gadgets which I prefer over tons of the same  negative:    very short in a blood &amp; gore approach   unlike  Assassin's Creed  not open world at all - cannot understand some comments which state otherwise.    nothing really exciting level design-wise. Get from low ground to high ground and back down again    unlike  Notes ,  Books  don't disappear after being picked up and are often double, which is a pain when leaving all cover just to find out, you already got that one. Obviously should help to collect them, but no good approach.   graphics  Really, have to be mentioned because this might be the most controversial part of my review and again, before you downvote my review for not being  helpful , please accept my personal view on this: I found the graphics unlike HL2 very kitchy and the coffin like structures everywhere were a too unsubtle reminder of the overall plague situation in  Dunwall . Besides, the citadel structures next to the  Boyle  estate made me looking for  Alyx &amp; Dog ; sorry this was too much of copying  City 17 . Besides, and this is non controversial, the graphics also feel as dated as in HL2 and this was 10ys ago. Ok, one or two sunsets doesn't make much of a difference.  The characters lack polygones, but this is nicely compensated for by using caricature like expressions. Again, the ♥♥♥♥♥ are a disgrace like in any American video game's brothel: No ♥♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥ to see as usual but at least some shiny tattoos. Why is it an adult game then - nipples are worse than chopped off heads or what?   bugs/etc.  The game itself seems ok, but I had massive bugs in the Steam overlay due to failing synchronisation which caused game critical bugs (as in killing the game). Exiting and re-entring Steam helped as a workaround. Luckily, this only happened once in-game.",

Downsides:  - Stealth has been glitchty for me, before you say your doing it wrong, I compeleted MGS 1,2 3, 3DS, 4, twin snakes and Peacewalker all on Euro extreme/hardest setting stealth, no alerts and no kills, so I know stealth. But here, guards keep popping out of no where, and dark vision does f*ck all to see them, I know it has a range, BUT WHEN THE RANGE IS 2CM, THEN WE HAVE AN ISSUE, other then that, Stealth CAN work sometimes, most of the time guards just insta spot me while I'm hiding in the shadows, so I'm forced to go in guns blazing 75% of the time.  Also smashing glasses does f*ck all, not joking, I smashed a glass in a guards face and he did nothing, didn't move, didn't attack until I walked infront of him....  - The Story is unintresting, while in the beginning it plays the obvious parent is gonna die and the child is gonna be kidnapped card, thats the only intresting thing, rest of it is boring and I keep finding myself skipping them.  - Some powers are no where as good as the others, like I mentioned Dark vision works whenever it feels like it, Blink is broken and is the only power you should use, freezing time while fun, is only good for escapes or quick kills, Devoring Storm is nearly useless, and the Wind Power is decent.  - Some cutscenes can't be skipped, while others can..... why?  - All company logos can't be skipped.... why?

            "review_text": "I originally thought that Dishonored was an open world RPG similar to Skyrim or Fallout, but it turns out that it’s actually closer to Deus Ex Human Revolution (action/stealth). Since I only had the free weekend to finish the game I didn’t try to go for all the achievements that I normally would. However, the game lets you know right from the start that the fewer people you kill, the better the outcome will be. That means no hacking and slashing like I was planning to.   In the game you play Corvo, the chief bodyguard of the empress. When the empress is killed and her daughter kidnapped, you get framed for the crime and sentenced to death. Your main goal in the game is to rescue the daughter and bring the actual murderers to justice. Since the bad guys are high up in the government, this means you’ll mostly be fighting government soldiers and religious zealots. You’re not alone in your quest since a magical being called the Outsider gives you powers that you can use to complete your objectives. The game does a lot of its background storytelling through notes and books that you run across all over the place. The Dishonored world seems to be roughly 1800’s technology with magic thrown in, resulting in a steampunk environment. The graphics are very similar to the Bioshock games (including that annoying blur effect when you walk through falling water).  As I alluded to earlier, Dishonored is not really an RPG. You don’t gain experience or level up. There’s no big reason to kill or knock out enemies if you can just sneak around them (unless you want them out of the way for exploration). Your magic powers are upgraded by finding “runes” throughout the game world. Each rune acts like a skill point that you can use to gain or improve your magic powers. The main power you’ll be using is Blink, which is a short range teleport, which is great for getting around and avoiding enemies. The magic powers are generally not “offensive” meaning you’re not throwing fireballs or shooting lighting. Generally they’re for supporting your stealth (see through walls, killed enemies disintegrate, turn into a rat). Almost all your objectives have multiple solutions. You can run through fighting (not recommended) or find various hidden paths like climbing roofs or going through small tunnels. Similar to Deus Ex, when you sneak up on an enemy you can choose a non-lethal takedown or assassinate. Then you need to hide the body since enemies will raise alarm if they find dead or unconscious buddies lying out in the open. There is also a combat system which includes guns and the sword (you can block enemy sword swings). Since I played stealth, I didn’t engage in very much combat. And since I didn’t do a lot of fighting, my ammunition filled up really fast. You can hold a small number of healing/mana potions and arrows/bullets for your weapons.   Overall Dishonored is great and well worth your time. However I wouldn’t say it’s “must play” like some others (Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider 2013, etc.). If you’re not into stealth games you will probably get annoyed at times when the enemy random patrols just don’t give you a chance to sneak past. I’ve read online that some people thought the game’s story was weak. It’s not amazing but not bad either. The story mostly just drives the gameplay and tells you where to go. I managed to finish the game during the free weekend a few days ago and it took roughly 16 hours, probably because I was going for no-kills and no-detection. Failed both by the way :(  ",

While it was quite nice, finding alternative routes and hiding all the sleeping bodies, the second playthrough has been so much better.  For a game that rewards you for being a good guy (sneaking, not killing), being a badass warrior is too damn fun. While I don't use any magic on this run, the feeling of battling half a dozen guards at once is amazing. Blink behind, stab, shoot another one to the face, lob a sticky grenade on one, blink away from explosion, lock your sword with the last one and remove his head. It is frankly quite intoxicating.   Also, seeing all the differences between different runs make you appreciate the game much more, even if the differences are small.  The fact that you can be shot or stabbed in the back while swordfighting another guard, is really good compared to Batman / Assassin's Creed type of combo-counter brawl. You have to think ahead or be ready to use your weapons, you can't just jump in the middle of a group of hostiles.  10/10 would play again (almost did already)",

I love Dishonored because it puts me in a world filled with intricately linked systems and sets me free to experiment with them. Every item effects every other item in logical ways, producing a depth of interactivity that is incredibly deep, with combinations of systems coming naturally as you think about your environment as an actual world.  I love that Dishonored doesn't try in vain to deliver photorealistic graphics, and instead utilizes a gorgeous visual style of watercolors and caricatures combined with surrealist lighting. Where so many other games struggle for life-like detail and end up slipping into the uncanny valley, Dishonored uses a non-realistic approach that is evocative and suggestive, making every character and locale a joy to look at.  I love how Dishonored feels when I'm moving around. Every motion in the game is so beautifully smooth, from running to climbing, jumping to sliding. After playing Dishonored it's hard to go back to games where sprinting is limited and I can't jump up and grab a ledge to get over a wall. Mirror's Edge did running so well, and Dishonored surpasses it in every way.  I love playing Dishonored because of all the options I've given when approaching a situation. There are countless ways through each area and multiple solutions to each objective, making stealth and combat equally viable playstyles.  I could go on and on, but I'm going to cut this short. Simply put, it's a game that does nearly everything right. Every single aspect of the gameplay is masterfully crafted and polished to perfection. Buy this game. Buy it right now.",

If you enjoyed Bioshock Infinite then this game should be on your next to play list as both of the games play very similar making your experience fun and not too convoluded. The only reason this did not get a 10/10 is because it had some annoying texture pop-in sequences every once in a while which strained my eyes, but they happened only once or twice. The game included excelent voice acting and a script that was engaging when being assigned smaller tasks or even when talking to the citizens of the city of dunwall. Overall though the game had a great stealth system rivaling that of the Metal Gear Solid franchise. Many people would say that it was basically a first person assassin's creed, but it is much more than that. The game not only discourages killing but it rewards you with less enemies the next mission and less obstacles to overcome, this makes stealthing not only fun but also more satisfying knowing that it will be even easier for you during the next mission. The dlc did not feel as if it was a waste of money. in fact it was far from that. The exploits of the master assassin Daud were just as timeless as those of Corvo mkaing it a must buy for those that own or are looking at the game. Overall this was a fantastic game and was non-stop intrigue and fun that will motivate you to keep on playing even if you get frusterated. As stated earlier i give this game a 9.5/10",

            "review_text": "Actions speak louder than words in the city of Dunwall, a cesspool of crime, corruption, and plague. Corvo Attano, the hired bodyguard for the Empress, must use everything at his disposal to clear his name and rid the city of corruption and deceit.  Dishonored has surprised me in many ways, from its unique watercolor art style to its brilliant combat system. Ultimately, the game is not what I had expected after seeing the first theatrical trailer featuring a man in a jail cell. That being said, I wasn’t a fan after the first twenty minutes of play. Eventually, I put it down and moved on to other things – after a few months, I came back to give it another try. That was when I realized what I had been missing.  I’ll summarize my thoughts about this game in a simple pros/cons list, but I will elaborate on each item.    PROS :  &gt; Unique Art Style &lt; The brushed watercolor style that decorates a unique city called Dunwall may initially come across as outdated and technologically inferior to other games created during the same time period. Some players may view the style with that pessimistic attitude, and some may view it as a unique work of art. I chose the latter.  &gt; Interesting Story and Deep Lore &lt; The story is a special experience, and your actions will matter – remember who you are and whom your actions affect. Read the books you find and drop eaves on conversations to discover the surprisingly deep backstory.  &gt; Excellent Voice Acting &lt; You will certainly recognize whom you're talking to, because the voice acting is consistently stellar throughout the entire game.  &gt; Worthwhile DLC &lt; Although they rarely see big sales, all three DLC packages are worth your time and money.  &gt; Best Assassin Experience &lt; There is no better assassin experience in any game. I’ll explain this below in the sections on combat and stealth.  &gt; Brilliant Stealth &lt; The game can be completed without ever being seen by an enemy – ever. It’s a tricky thing to master, but it is a very fun way to play the game. The player may also rush into battles with guns a’blazing and blades a’sparking.  &gt; Combat Is Incredible &lt; The combat system is intricate, diversified, and very expertly crafted. There are many ways to go about clearing an area (it rewards those who enter a battle with a plan of action).  This game is much, much more fun if you are creative  – trust me.    CONS :  &gt; Game Length &lt; I would have loved to see more, but perhaps that’s why we buy DLC. Also, keep in mind that the length of the game depends on how you play. Fast and furious will make the game shorter, while slow and stealthy will make the game longer. Both are great fun.  &gt; NPC Animations &lt; Corvo's actions look swift and fluid, but the actions of other NPCs seem a little repetitive, stiff, and awkward during conversations. This may take away from how much you care for characters.  &gt; Story Vagueness &lt; Some elements of the story are a little vague, but this is minor. Plus, it is usually fixed by digging into the lore provided by books and conversations.   I would place Dishonored somewhere among my top twenty favorite video games. It’s a worthwhile experience that is always fun to revisit. Do the right thing and buy this game, already.",

Combined review discussing Dishonored, Dunwall City Trials, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches.*   I've never been a fan of the silent protagonist. Dishonored and its two DLCs, 'The Knife of Dunwall' and 'The Brigmore Witches' present an interesting opportunity to play as both a silent and a voiced protagonist within essentially the same game. The main game has you playing as Corvo Attano who has a backstory but is otherwise a blank slate for you to control. Both DLCs put you behind the eyes of Daud, an assassin that you first run in to as Corvo. It would have been jarring to suddenly strip Daud of the voice he had in the original game, so he retains it into the DLCs and, in my opinion, they are better for it.  As Corvo, you sit and listen as characters monologue at you or talk to each other. As Daud, you have conversations, relationships and motives of your own. Giving your protagonist a voice makes him or her interesting, allows for natural conversations and doesn't force the game's writers to avoid lines that would normally elicit a response. And it doesn't come at the cost of robbing players of making choices at key moments, as the DLCs demonstrate.  There are positives to get to, but let me get through one more negative first. Dishonored's primary story and characters are mostly predictable, standard fare. NPCs are limited to the aforementioned monologues that are generally kept short in favor of gameplay. Both DLCs are significantly better in this regard but don't expect RPG levels of depth. The voice acting, however, is all around excellent.  The main attraction of Dishonored is its gameplay. It's a fusion of stealth, parkour, magic, and both melee and ranged combat. All slickly delivered from a first-person perspective. Besides the blink spell (short range teleport), you are given the choice of what spells and upgrades you want to unlock first to best match your play style. There are two general play styles that result in different endings to the game: the nonlethal (often stealthy) 'low chaos' path and the 'high chaos' path that revels in death and battle. This is true in the DLCs as well. Whichever style you choose, the level design will allow you numerous ways to get around and sometimes multiple ways to accomplish an objective. Game length can vary wildly with high chaos being the quicker route.  While Dishonored's story may be lackluster, the atmosphere of the world it takes place in is wonderful. The art and sound design both excel at bringing this place to life. The soundtrack takes a more subtle, atmospheric approach that gets the job done but is otherwise unremarkable. You'll find notes and books scattered throughout the game that fill in the details of what goes on in this world. I hesitate to list this as a complaint, but there is a spell that significantly alters how the world looks for the worse but is so useful that I rarely turned it off. It allows you to see enemies through walls while tinting everything orange (similar to the Batman Arkham games' detective mode).  Dunwall City Trials is exactly what it sounds like it is: purely gameplay. No story, no impactful player choices, just arcade style pursuit of high scores. I would suggest replaying the rest of the game at a different chaos level than your first playthrough and then if you're still hungry for more, play these.   Dishonored: 7/10  --- 16 hours*  Dunwall City Trials: 5/10  --- 3 hours*  The Knife of Dunwall: 8/10  --- 6 hours, no alerts or kills*  The Brigmore Witches: 8/10  --- 7 hours, no alerts or kills*   (* estimated playtime for my single low chaos playthrough) ",

The graphics are wonderfully stylised, with a selection of interesting characters that aren't too out of the ordinary, but not bland enough to make you forget them. The protagonist in particular, Corvo, is wonderfully created, so you can imagine what kind of man he would be and play him to that image, whether he's the forgiving kind of killer or whether he just wants to see Dunwall burn. The story-line is intriguing and there's plenty of different turns you don't expect that I've enjoyed so far. Plus I love the man eating rats. The game has levels of customisation whether you want to use a gun, crossbow or the supernatural powers you're given early in the game, with plenty of collectbles to find each mission and requires a level of intelligence to find, as getting to them are sometimes puzzling. So far I simply adore this game and if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed, Thief and Bethesda's works, I can't recommend this game enough.",

Combat is fun. Stealth is fun. Replaying sections isn't obnoxious. AI is forgiving. Maps are expansive. Actually optional side-missions. Actually balanced gameplay. Immersive dialog. Immersive everything. This game has all the best parts from Hitman, Assassin's Creed, Bioshock, and somehow managed to stay original and not be patchwork of bad ideas.

            "review_text": "Dishonored sits high upon my list of ultimate favourite games. A beautifully morbid setting as Dunwall falls to a mysterious and infectious plague, you, as Corvo Attano, the body guard of the empress, is charged with her assassination. Starting from the bottom up you have to escape your execution and find out who really committed the assassination, as well as put an end to the plague that threatens to send the entire city into further ruin.  The graphics have always been one of my favourite points about Dishonored. An odd sort of soft cell-shaded that perfectly fits the tone and mood of the game. Granted some of the character's faces do look a little weird, but that could easily be down to artistic license to better portray the 'personality'.   As a previous consolefag who moved to PC gaming recently, I do have a few unfortunate downsides as opposed to the Xbox 360 version, which I played and completed first. The default controls have a half second response delay which is really noticable when you get into combat, or attempting to use the teleport ability and need precise, accurate aiming. Using a controller is slightly better, but there's still that moment of delay that could quite easily hinder someone. There's also this odd crackling noise in the audio that'll cause the music and any other noise from going quiet while it goes on, and occurs over a period of several seconds to a minute at sporadic intervals. Whether or not these can be fixed in the options menu I've yet to find out, as I've admitted before I am fairly new to PC gaming, but in either case I loved the game enough to buy it on Steam despite having it completed 100% on Xbox - you honestly can't compare it, even with its faults. It's definitely a game for people who enjoy a more unorthadox art style in gaming, a morbid, supernatural setting (a la Mythos of Cthulhu), branching story lines and clever stealth based systems. ",

Mood: Half Life 2 and accompanying episodes. Moderate anxiety stealth with enhanced sensory awareness and many choices.  Mechanic and special powers: reminiscent of Bioshock and inFAMOUS Second Son.  Sets: Beautifully designed levels.  Powerups: Rare but sufficient powerups dispersed throughout the levels. Health and special powers elixirs.  Special powers system: “Powers” that you can select and use with one of your hands as in Bioshock and Skyrim. “Bone Charms” that give you special personal skills as in Fallout 3.  Difficulty: Challenging missions, but very doable if you are patient and carefully plan your moves. Few boss fights and they are not crazy hard (on “Normal”).  Replay value: High. Many different options, different gameplay styles to decide upon, different routes to take on any given mission. High chaos: many encounters with enemies. Low chaos: avoiding enemies with meticulous planning and stealth.  Overall impression: One of the best games in my library. Compelling and immersive story that motivated me the way Bioshock Infinite, Wolfenstein: The New Order, and Half Life 2 did.  Final thoughts: With a little modification, this game could have formed a solid foundation for Half Life 3.",

The setting is a pretty effective low-key horror, macabre without being over-the-top. Story is unintrusive--you can pay as much or as little attention to it as you want without it affecting your experience much. It's well put together though, as well as largely character-driven. The main annoyance is the protagonist being silent for no apparent reason (though he'll apparently be talking in the upcoming sequel).

So, let's talk about the game now.  The sound design is good, the visuals are great with it's cel-shaded graphics and overall colorful world. Now, before you say 'Oh, it's just gray and brown' I'd like to bring up the difference between contrasted colors and just colors. Everything makes sense and fits there. I've found myself immersed in the game like a 12-yr old being immersed in the idea of big boobs so many times.  The combat is iffy for sure. It's fun if you're willing to make it fun for yourself. That doesn't mean that you should put in place restrictions, but kind of the opposite. You should be running, jumping around and using your powers to a full. In normal combat, the enemy will usually just stun kick you away and just doesn't give you a chance to fight them one on one properly.  The stealth is easy but keeps being satisfying. Thanks to the powers like blink, it's very easy to just teleport past the guards without much of a hassle.  The level layout is everything that you would like. Multiple entrance points. Multiple ways to traverse the levels and the abilities will make it even better. Now, the last thing to mention is the story. And all I can say is that 'It's a'ight!'. It's nothing special, it's not bad, some main characters are fleshed out, some are completely random and just feel like set-pieces. I still don't remember who is who and why they did something or didn't do something. It's an ok story that's not amazing.   Overall: With its flaws, Dishonored is still an amazing game.  8/10 (All games start off at a 5/10 and the grade will increase/decrease based on pros and cons)",

I then sat through the opening sequence of Dishonored. What Bethesda and Arkane do here is a slice of the steampunk cake, that makes me want to sit here and keep eating until there is nothing left. Albeit a story which really gets hacked off at the knees with a rather weak ending, the environment and sound-tracking for Dishonored finds me hard pressed to suggest another RPG outside of my FF comfort zone. I had also never dabbled in the stealth games before, but even though that wasn't my thing when I started, and I hacked my way through the storyline, Arkane built the game so that based on type of play the storyline sees real changes. If you are going to break out the digital wallet to pick up a new game, the game design alone had my steampunk and proto-industrial side poking like a nail, and everything else the game had to offer was just a huge plus. Don't buy any other RPG, except maybe what I remember as being a reformatted FF8 (New to Steam, but not the same without a controller) - Dishonored is it. Just exploring Dunwall was more than worth my money - so do it, and you won't regret it.",

Similar to Deus Ex and Hitman style games, you have a ton of options on how you want to play the game. Whether you prefer to sneak by every guard undetected, or rush through with guns blazing and sword drawn, it's up to you. You don't even have to kill your assassination targets; instead you can find clever ways of making sure they're never seen again. The music is also absolutely amazing, and I'd hope to see an official soundtrack released at some point in the future.

You are Corvo, the royal protector who was framed for the murder of the empress. You must then take your revenge on those who framed you with the help of magic from the Outsider and gadgets from Piero to aid you in your stealthing.  One of the main reasons I love this game so much is player choice. My playtime reflects that you can play the game more than once. If you're playing it once you aren't doing it right. At the shortest, you can play the whole game excluding the even shorter DLCs in about ten hours. However, the game offers many ways to play it through multiple times. In this regard, Dishonored is like an RPG. To compare to Fallout, another Bethesda game, my first run in both games is what I would do. In Fallout, I would side with the good guys (mostly) and be mostly nice. In Dishonored, I would use as much magic as I could, get as many runes as possible, not kill many people (murder wasn't out of the question though) and do other things I won't get into for spoilers' sake. I played a female psychopath in Fallout next, and in Dishonored I got all three achiemements for not killing anyone. You can play the whole game without killing anyone and in the sequel, you can do the whole game without magic.   Speaking of the magic, it's a great thing to put into a stealth game. In games like Metal Gear, it focuses on raw stealth in which you use distractions and funny looking diving to sneak about. With magic, you augment your sneaking so it becomes easier and more fun. It's optional however, except the first tier of blink. With blink, you can teleport a short distance to reach high places or traverse crowded streets faster. There is also dark vision that lets you see through walls. All of these powers make the game a very fun escape from traditional stealth games. Along with these powers, you get bone charms that add passives.   To get this magic you have to collect runes and bone charms. These are often placed off the beaten path and finding them leads you into interesting sidequests and cool lore to find. The game is rich in lore. Books are everywhere and audiologs explain a lot of things. You will learn about the seven scriptures of the overseers and why they name the months like month of nets. These sidequests and alternate pathways are different each time you play. If you seek runes early in the game, someone will ask you to poison a bootleg elixr distillery, and in the very next level, you are recruited by the person you ruined to do something.   With a story rich universe and fun mechanics and player choice, Dishonored is a must play for fans of stealth and story.",

I leave a skeptic as akways, but it is certainly worth the purchase for someone interested in the genre.   Gameplay: Dishonered lets you float like a butterfly, sting like a bee, almost to the point where you feel like you are playing Theif with cheat codes. This feeling of absolute power seems to stem mostly from the absolute power of being able to blink (teleport short distances) which is probably the most valuable power you could ever dream of controlling in a stealth genre game. The game manages to create a set of mechanics that allow you to approach a situation from many possible angles, allowing your individually crafted outcome to become something quite unique. However, I felt the environments were still stagnant, and never really forced myself to approach problems from new and unique angles. Dishonered throws you all the God like toys, but it never really forces you to get creative with them and really push the limits of the puzzle aspect it provides you. Overall the game feels a bit too easy, finishing in just over 20 hours, with the only replay content being some DLC and going scavenging for missed runes and charms which is simply no fun for someone like me. A note: games like this tend to boast their open ended approach, but in the end it still feels like you are being led along at the end of a leash. Each objective is tagged with an omniscient arrow, which if you disable, you may easily be clueless about where to go next.  Story: I found the story interesting enough, and it wasn't terribly difficult to sympathize with your character (Corvo's) plight. There were many missed and unread notes and many nuances I probably didn't pick up from the extended material, but it is all saved in your journal so you can go back and read. There seemed to be a definite morality system based on your action, big and small, and somehow I ended up being an agent of chaos, even though I felt like I tried my best to be a good guy. Some larger decisions feel rather forced, and since my gamplay was very intermittent, I felt like I didn't have enough information about who should be saved and who should be eliminated. I find games that constantly nag me to be the purveyor of some arbitary justice to be a bit forceful and annoying. In other words, I feel like they throw these situations at you because they know its this idea that theoretically all gamers crave weird difficult moral scenarios, so they throw a few random decisions your way because their producers breathe down their necks about it.  overall i give it a 4/5, worth it, but could be better.",

I think the game is too short to be $20, you may or may not get only around 10 hours out of the game as if you are a hardcore gamer you can blaze thru this in probably under 3 hours, then go back and get a different ending even faster.   The game had a great story, minus the outsider who had no real business other then giving you powers, and also the lack of in real time change of how your actions affect people (would of been great to see them react differently when I came back after slaughtering everyone) after a mission, because then I would of been able to change mission to mission to maybe get a different ending but no one reacted majorly so I just kept doing the same and then by the end I had no chance of recovery.  Everything in this game is fun and unique, some things seem really unrealistic to the era or even to anything but if you can get over it the game is really enjoyable.

The noticeable thing in the game is the enviroment that gets you pretty fast in the game. You can almost feel the plauge fear and the atmosphere of the game in your veins.   If we talk about the desing of the game, there isn't much to say: Perfect. You can smell the steampunk even in the very first minute of the game. Buildings, gagdets, paintings in the wall, scent of the dead, clothing of the people... etc. It just fits perfect when you combine these things! You can always find different routes if you play the game couple of times. I may be saying these because while Bethesda was working in this game, they transferred one of the main designer of the Valve to their team. (A Half-Life fan boy here- Give us the freaking HF3!) If you pay attettion to the enviroment, you can feel Half-Life-ish atmosphere. I'm not saying that this game is copy, they made their job pretty well.  Characters are pretty well, too. While playing the game you can find every type of person and see the war between the classes in the game. You can make deals with people that will change the game pretty much. You can use characters to make your ending brighter or even darker. You can make a person dissappear from the game -with a cost of course.   *Be wary spoilers start* With the DLC's you can play as Daud's -one of the main characters in the game you see within the first 10 minutes of the game. Playing the game from Daud's eyes made pretty different appreance about Daud, the Killer of the Empress. The main hero was Corvo in the game if you play in low chaos and sort of savior in high chaos, but this doesn't matter because with the DLC's you can see the true savior was Daud even though he killed 'Her'. *spoiler ends*  In the end all i can give to this game is my cosplay, my money and my sympathy. The things that this game can give you is much more than that. I even cried a bit in the end of the main game. Perfect gameplay combined with not bad graphics (I can tolerate a game without Crysis or Battlefield graphics if the story is this nice!), pretty good enviroment, characters and The Outsider! 9, even 10 out of 10 if you play the game over and over again.  9/10 -Bethesda, I'm looking forward for a new DLC to make things even better (Like a new person that has a Mark on him/her) or even Dishonored 2 i don't know.

The story was excalent and all the options, collectables, and differant play styles makes the game unuiqe, replayable, and downright great. Only thing I don't see as overwelmingly amazing is the combat, this could have to do with me trying to go without killing anyone untill I got annyoed and just killed whoever saw me while I was being stealthy, however, I won't let that object to my opinion of it being the best single player game I have played thus far. The game is very submersive and I finished in in an 11 hour single sitdown and I enjoyed every second on it. The end had such a good closer, even more so that it can change due to how you played. I enjoyed the experiance however I don't know if a sequal would be good for it. It's such a magnifcant game that another one in it's series could be watered down, not up to par with the first one and or our expectations, or just seem forced out and not somthing that was needed. I will still try a sequal though however I will have INSANLY high excpectations going into it. That may also be a reason I found this game so great, my original excpectations for it were quite low but it blew them out of the water. If you're looking for that obligatory and irrelivant numerical number to sum up all of what I just said, well first off go away and secondly 10/10 (I am really hesitant to give it a 10 becuase I hate giving things a 10 but I can not find anything that I disliked about the game from my playthrough, however I may have missed stuff but this rating is being created from that playthrough, not any random bs you can think of to show me after I have made my mind up)",

They are not prolific and in fact have released only a few games (Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic, Dishonored) and helped with a few others (COD:WAW, Bioshock 2, Half-Life 2) but those titles they do release are excellently developed and well designed.  Dishonored has large amounts of flexibility on how you want to play from stealthy to outright carnage and destruction. There are so many options and such interactivity that the game still surprises me to this day as I play around with the levels and see what others are able to pull off. You only need to spend 2 minutes watching some of the play videos on the web to understand how well developed and interactive this game is. I suggest taking a moment to watch StealthGamerBR or Volound videos, even if you have already played the game, to see what the engine/game allows for gameplay and the amazing amount of fun you can have.  Highly recoomend this game for all types of first person game fun.",

            "review_text": "A great first-person stealth game. Avoids being too frustrating (one of the things I don't like about some stealth games) by providing a nice quick save and quick load system. The level designs are very non-linear in a way I haven't seen in other stealth games, letting you make the most of whatever abilities you choose, allowing for discovery of all sorts of secrets and alternate ways to complete stages, and generally giving you a nice variety of options.  On top of simply completing each stage, they provide a wealth of optional challenges that can increase the difficulty of the game or give you something to go for with repeated playthroughs.  Some might consider this game to be short. I appreciated the short length. Some games try to drag the experience out and end up becoming repetitive slogs, and they tend to do this towards the end of the game so you finish the game on a less-than-stellar note. This game doesn't do that. You only spend a short amount of time in each new environment, and the story moves along at a constant pace. If you do find yourself wanting more, there's replayability in going for the challenges and achievements or in playing the DLC.  That said, while the game was fun, it didn't pass the same threshold of fun that some other games achieve. There's no Dark Souls-esque fiero (apparently it's a word used to describe the rush felt when accomplishing something difficult) at completing a difficult challenge or besting another person in combat. There's no grand 'aha' moment as you finally solve a difficult puzzle (like in many puzzle games). There's no sensory overload like you get with fast-paced arcade-style games (you want to avoid detection, so you just end up quick-loading whenever that happens instead of playing it out and adopting a 'run-and-gun' style of play). It's not an 'audio-visual treat' as some might describe games like Dyad or Fez. It has some elements of each of these, but not to the extent of other games.  As far as problems go: I was frustrated at how many options it gave you for lethal kills while telling you not to use them. I ended up only buying the movement, blink, and time stop abilities and relying on the sleep darts. That whole time, I was staring at all this other cool stuff that I was not supposed to use. I had fun playing in this way, but I wished, if I was supposed to be stealthy, they would provide more tools and abilities for such a playstyle. Also, the writing is kind of unintelligent and contrived. The characters do things that don't really make sense, in retrospect. It ruins the immersion of the game when you start to notice the ways in which the characters don't act like real people and makes you less invested in the plot.  So, it's fun and it has only a few problems to speak of, but, as a whole, it's lacking the 'peaks' of entertainment that you can find in other excellent games. If you're looking for something that reaches that level of 'amazing', I might pass on this game, but if you're looking for a solid first-person action game with an interesting story, I recommend this game.",

I didn't found any motivation, or something interesting to keep playing it, but it was all going by itself mission after mission, where the story got a bit more interesting.  Review doesn't contain storyline spoilers.   This game adapts as you play it. You have -tons- of choises within the storyline, as well as different approaches and ways to play it (stealthy, lethal, non-lethal, full rambo, etc). Everything you do has a huge impact on the ending, which is not always the same.   Going onto the gameplay and mechanics. They are fine for a 2012 game. Not really polished enough for my taste. NPCs are not so bright if you ask me :D (stupid as f*ck). If you're going on the stealthy side, you will have a challange not because they are intelligent or have eyes, but because they are many. If you are going on the rambo side, you will have a -huge- challange 'cause they are many. Combat is fine, although it gets irritating when you are like 1 vs 7.   Going onto the graphics and over performance, well, it will receive a 5/10 from me for graphics and 11/10 for overall game performance. Yeah, half of Steam Community will jump on my head, but for a 2012 game, the graphics are not what they should be. I maxed out every setting and had a stable 130FPS (which I think it's capped there, otherwise I think it would jump right to 99999999), and I felt like playing Left 4 Dead 2 on Low settings.  On top of everything, it was a nice game, although won't be my last time playing it. I still have to finnish the DLCs and I still want to re-do the storyline on a stealthy non-lethal approach :).  And for the 10Euro I paid for the full Dishonored game, it's worth it.  8/10 would recommend.",

Loyal and deadly bodyguard on a mission to avenge the Empress in Dunwall's darkest hour.  I mean the game itself looks stunning, the painting type effects make the game feel very dark and suit it very well. With cool side characters like Slackjaw you can really play the game how you want to to achieve your final goal, however the way in which you go about this will change Dunwall, for better or for worse is up to the player to use their head.  The combat for the game is incredible, you can pull off some pretty insane kills with the large choice of weapons given to the player, that's not even including the magic. There are millions of horrible ways to dispatch your enemies. Or perhaps spare them. Should they really be held accountable for the actions of those in command? This is where the game shines.   I would give this 95/100. The only possible thing I could say bad about this game is the campaign is quite short, but when there are as many ways to complete it as there are, who really cares?

Knowing that Dishonored 2 is currently in development (as I am writing this review) makes me happy.    My review when the game was still fresh in my head 2 years ago: [A really awesome, if not probably the best assassin game you will ever play. You can either play on two paths: Non-lethality, which means you will have to use stealth most of the time and choke your enemies to death OR; Lethality, which means killing EVERYONE because it is awesome. The combat of the game is great! And you have really cool powers so use them to your advantage. This game really makes you feel like an assassin. Okay maybe thats the sole purpose of assassin games, but killing key targets are pretty fun. Time would slow down a bit and music would play as you kill key targets with your blade, whether it is a stab from behind or a full-out frontal assault. A few downsides of the game are namely 1. How they poorly introduce you to Lady Emily, the daughter of the Empress, 2. The eyes of the characters dont really show any expression, they blink but they dont really change, and lastly 3. You will have a 'bossfight' later in the game, but it was so easy I dont think it's a boss fight. Overall great game. I dont care about the downsides I just mentioned. It's 10/10]",

Aside from that, the game seems to have a lot of emphasis on 'let's count the ways you can commit mass murder' for a game that has a pseudo-morality system, the graphics and aesthetic are very nice (if just a combination of Bioshock's aesthetic and Half-Life 2's aesthetic), the gameplay holds up well until the absolute last bit of the absolute last level (where the guards are combination of immovable and clueless, for reasons I can't come up with), there are a fair number of powers but not enough runes to go around and not enough powers that can be used non-lethally (most of them focus on lethality or cause needless death when used), and the audio is very nice.  Overall I give it a 4/5 (would recommend if it's $10-15, MAYBE $20), and it could be made absolutely perfect with modding. Personally I've had my fill of the game's mechanics (which for me, boil down to 'blink behind guard, choke guard, hide guard, don't get caught, ad nauseum'), so I'd skip the DLCs.",

            "review_text": "Dishonored has got to be one of my favorite games, and by far my favorite stealth and assassin game. This game gets you thosed in the middle of a kindom of choas, like a world about to crumble, and you have the job of keeping it together. The story sucks you in almost immediately, as after mostly watching and a little bit of playing the intro, I was already saying 'Wow' and wanting to playing this game. The highest point of this game is it's gameplay. Stealth and/or assassin games are both either do really really well or really really bad. This game was focus on what it should: gameplay. There are moments that are just so satisfing, and leaves you wanting more. The CPUs are very smart and only somewhat glitched, which I wish I could say about some games. They made the AI very well, and it's something you have to see to believe.  Now comes to the bad part. The bad parts. I though I recomend, I wouldn't rate this game very high. It is one of my favorite games, but there are just to many bugs. The CPUs I mention earlier, though they are well thought out and working on hard, I find it *small spoiler* the first 3 levels are easy, then the AI just skyrocketed. The last few missions where really much more challenaging, and each stage was 30x harder than those *small spoiler again* 3 levels. The whole game should have been like that! It offered challages and stituations that required thinking. There was 3 ways to do it on the *small spoiler again* first 3 levels, but the last there were a million, not counting the ones that didn't work. Getting over the CPUs and level design, lets talk about the story. Though the story immers you from the start to finish, and you always want to see what happens, it's to predictable. Nothing in the story truely shocked me like they ment it to. *small spoiler once more* The only time something the story happened that I didn't expect was small small parts in the end. My last complant is the use of magic. The game allows you to use magic that helps you out in some situations, which I'm glad they did, but they made it to hard to use. The only way to be able to have use for ALL the magic stills AND level them up AND get the other type of magic charm is by going out of way and spending another 2-3 hours on the game. Spending a much tolerence as possible on the game, I spent about an hour more collecting extra 'runes' and still I didn't have all the magic powers like I planned. The creators may have done this on purpose, but I find it annoying (the game is still beatable with out them, it's not THAT hard to beat the game without them).  So overall, I give this game a 8.5/10. It satisfied me, and in the end is the best assassin game to date. They could have just done so much more with it, but from there point of view, I see how at the time it did look perfect therefore was very understandable. For the price of the game and the DLC, It's worth more than what it's listed at or what it ever was listed as. Can't wait for Dishonored 2!!!!!!",

And observing and planning you will probably do, as it shines when played as a melting pot of Thief, Hitman, and Deus Ex, yet unlike those three if you go for a loud-and-violent solution, *that's* fairly slick too.

At the end of the day, sneaking around is nowhere near as entertaining as using all of your powers and weapons and even simply using your sword to duel guards is more fun than sneaking.  The plot is quite intriguing but it abuses collectable books to explain it properly which may not be of your liking, considering you want to play a video game and not read a book. The story progression itself offers a nice sense of replayability and the way your perception of a level changes whether you decide to use stealth or go guns blazing just makes replaying it all the more enticing.  The setting is superb ( seriously, the obsession with whales and the lore are a very interesting read ) and the graphic style is quite pleasing and refreshing, definetely not something you see every day.  The two story-based DLCs improve completely with regards to the level design and some of the mechanics of the game and it explains another side of the main story, definitely worth picking up. The rest of the DLCs are not as great but if you end up loving the game and you want time trials and things like that, it is okay.  That being said, it is not a long game, very replayable if you like it a lot but also very short if you do not. You could probably finish it in about 8 hours or less if you go for the main objectives and ignore exploring the levels and doing all the side quests.",

From plunging a city into chaos by killing everything that walks, or being a shadow in the night that is never even seen, the possibilities are infinite (well pretty much). Not only are the rich level designs full of choices and consequences, but your decisions also affect the storyline and future mission levels. The more people you kill the darker the outcome, making future levels harder with more rats and weepers to deal with.  With the possibilities being endless the game is for all play styles, so you can do the ol' run and gun, or be like me and not harm so much as a rat, and finish the game without killing anyone and attempting to go for the insane personal challenge of collecting every single cent, (trust me its hard). Beside the decisions the game offers, the level design is deep and well written, plus the art style is great, personally I quite like the art style, very similar to the graphics displayed in borderlands and such.  With multiple different areas from flooded slums to militarised islands, and the homes or lords and ladies. Large array of weapons and supernatural powers, some of the weapons include shrapnel mines, grenades, a crossbow loaded with different kinds of bolts and a gun which later in the game becomes killer. The powers range from slowing time, teleporting, summoning rats and other cool powers that can help you sneak about like the rats you associate yourself with, or you can be a whirlwind or blades and sneakily slowed time grenade placements. With all these choices the game is brilliant, containing heaps but not too much, and if this isn't enough the DLC's provide even more...  Wow I wrote too much...again..",

What starts off as the 'good intentions' of a player in trying to properly sneak around ends up with the Rambo'ing of an entire level out of sheer frustration.  Not with Dishonored.  I've yet to play any stealth based game, including any Metal Gear Solid offering (arguably considered the king of stealth) that supplies the level of fluidity, options, and satisfaction in not being seen or shedding a single drop of blood that Dishonored provides. So much so that any time I had my cover broken, and invariably forced to switch to lethal methods, I felt a sense of responsibility to the spirit of the story to load a previous save and try utilizing different areas of the level or player abilities to successfully get through said portion completely unseen. In any other game I would consider this a complete waste of time, and slightly insane. But like I said, the “cool factor” of the stealth here is so freaking cool that you have to indulge it.   The atmosphere, level design, and characters within the game are equally top notch. One thing I really appreciated was the fact that you don't have to suspend your disbelief too hard to get into the role of the main character, as the design decision not to make him talk (or see what he looks like) is absolutely the right one for a game of this nature.

A friend told me to do this, and boy was he right. Words cannot express how helpful this ability is- I can't imagine playing without it. I pretty much used only this and Blink throughout the game, and rarely used anything else. - Quicksave a lot (F5 by default). I got to the point where I quicksaved before doing pretty much anything, and now my F5 key doesn't work anymore after hitting it so many times (just kidding). But it takes just a second, and in the long run it'll save you a lot of time. - Remember that there's no reason to go after every guard. At the beginning I was doing this, but later on I just stared sneaking by. Also, if they have a key, know that you can steal the key without even touching them...for some reason I was about 2/3 of the way through the game before learning this.  Although it's a great game, I do have a couple complaints:  - I ran into so many spots where there was an invisible boundary preventing me from going a certain way. Frustrating when you have to rethink your whole strategy &amp; approach due to an invisible boundary that doesn't even make sense as to why its there. - When I needed to choke someone out, there were a number of times where the game wouldn't let me do this for some reason. Occasionally I'd be right behind someone and in perfect position, but the 'choke out' option wouldn't appear, and then they'd turn around and see me. Then when I'd reload and try it again, I'd do the exact same thing and it'd work perfectly. Very weird and frustrating at times. - More than once I encountered a tricky spot with lots of people where I needed to carefully plan an approach...only to find out that this particular group is friendly and/or otherwise not going to attack you. The game sometimes doesn't communicate moments when you're among friendlies and/or are free to be seen without consequence. - The game is short. I'm slow as hell and like to explore a lot in these single player games, and I beat it in 11 hours. I'm sure many people finish it in 8-10 hours, if not faster.  Like I said though, it's a great game overall. My letter grade would be a B+ or A-",

Gone from my mind as this reality became very much consuming. I found myself thinking of this game constantly, what I could've done better, what mistakes I could've fixed if I only saved more often to correct them, my noobish start which made things turn for the worse in the end... oh if only. It's been years since I've felt so immersed in something, so taken by another reality. Something I haven't felt since childhood.   This game made me have to think, and act swiftly. It made me think all were attackers, and would punish me when afterwards I'd realize they weren't. If I made a mistake like avoiding someone who'd offer a clue to the next part of the story, it wouldn't screw me over by never allowing me to progress like other games do. Most of all, it allowed you to choose how you would act, and take out targets and allow you to take multiple ways to get to one destination. That quality is what most games miss, and the option to choose peoples fates and your own is what made me fall so hard for Dishonored.   There were times, during the game where I got annoyed with certain things, mainly the guards. They'd repeat the same things over and over like a broken record. It's nice to know where they are, but perhaps a wider variation of what they say would be nicer next time. I don't want to hear harland garland 50 times in a row.... whatever the hell that's supposed to mean. Yes, the guards like to mumble that a lot.  Now the ending.... note I've only played this through once, so this might be biased due to multiple different ones. The ending for me was bittersweet. It honestly brought me to tears. I don't cry for a story unless it's good, and this, and the game itself, managed to do that. So overall, this game, from start to finish was amazing. I'm glad a friend got this for me, I'm thankful I spent the time I did playing it. I have no regrets. Please buy this game at the full price with all the dlcs so the developers can keep making more like this.

            "review_text": "It's April 19 in 2014 and I have just finished my first playing of Dishonored. I picked up the game of the year edition during it's last sale a few weeks ago. I don't know why I ignored this game for so long. I even played a demo when it was first released long ago. It is a complex game with a little learning curve and I didn't realize at the time that Harvey Smith was a creative director of Dishonored. Deus Ex was a taste changing landmark game for me. I wasn't paying attention and the demo didn't capture my imagination at the time. I must have been tired!  This is a great first person perspective game with lots of alternative map paths to complete the missions and lots of interesting game play mechanics to change up your approaches to the many missions. The plot was very involving for me with a great surprise twist in the middle of the game. The voice acting is great and the dialogue has lots of variation depending upon how 'chaotic' your play style. You are going to want to play this at least twice.  I am still waiting for that 'good deal' to update my video card for the next generation so I have played this with a 9800 GT nvidia with just half a gig of video ram. I can max out all of the settings and it still runs great. The art work is beautiful. It all works well and didn't seem at all compromised for performance at all. You can sleep dart your opponents, sneak by them, kill them with an interesting array of weapons all having attractive displays. I ended up using 'blink' and my sword a lot so it ended up being a great sword fighting game for me against other 'blinking' assassins. I was pleasantly surprised by this.  No one needs this review at this late date but I liked the game so much I just had to do it.  ",

            "review_text": "If you can get this game for cheap, I'd say it's worth it. It's got a 'Victorian era meets Half-Life 2' vibe going for it, which I think is nice. The gameplay using powers leads to some fun and interesting ways to complete levels. The swordplay is pretty awful, though, so this really shouldn't be considered an action game. There are definitely times where, even though you are lined up to hit enemies with a sword swipe, the game just decides you already hit once in the last 3 seconds, so you won't do it again. I can't say there's any memorable music, but the voice acting is okay. Having played this game shortly after it came out and again recently, I would advise against getting the DLC as it so far isn't adding to the story and the levels are not really exciting. The main game is good enough that even if you want to go through it again with a different play style, it's worth it and just barely wears out its welcome by the end.  edit: I really can't bring myself to finish the DLC. Save your money, just get the base game and call it a day.",

Game kinda punishes you with the ending if you get high chaos, but that's that's not too bad because I went on 3 killing sprees in the first 3 chapters and still did well enough to get low chaos on very hard, with a happy Emily!

A lot of the negative reviews say that the game is too easy. I will admit that compared to other stealth games that I have played (Another of my favorites being Splinter Cell Chaos Theory, an oldie but goodie) the stealth is a bit easier because of the supernatural powers Corvo (you) has. However, I don't think that this impacts the gameplay as much as others are making it seem. If you really take your time and try to do a completely non-lethal run (something I am still going to attempt) this game is plenty hard and changes practically every time based on the decisions you make in game.

Overall this game is a must play before the second game comes out, its great value for money aswell with lots of re-playability, if i had to give this game a rating out of 100 i think id give it a 94, it does have its flaws but there isnt many of them in fact i cant even list them off the top of my head.  But yeah this game is a must buy i highly recomened it. :)  ",

You need to move with caution, and kill with caution - as the ending depends on how many kills you do: no kills = good ending, and the boatman being nice; lots o kills = bad ending and boatman being quite rude (not that that matters, but hes like your only friend...saving you and all halfway through).

I highly recommend this game if you are into a stealth game or if you like to use brute tactics and force in order to achieve your goal.  Introduction: The game introduces you as the 'Royal Protector' Corvo Attano, which is returning back to Dunwall to meet with Jessamine Kaldwin; the empress of Gristol, to tell her that he has not succeeded in finding a solution to the rat plague currently infesting Dunwall. His reunion with Jessamine is made short however, since she is assasinated right infront of him. Corvo tries to battle the assasins, he is however knocked out, giving the assasins an oppertunity of escaping. Shortly after 'the royal spymaster' shows up blaming Corvo for the murder of the empress. You then have to find out who murdered the empress, and reclaim your honor.  Gameplay: This game offers diversity in terms of strategy. I personally found myself discovering new ways of infiltrating target objectives on my third and fourth playthrough. This game also allows you to choose how you want to play. You can choose if you want to kill someone, or if you want to complete the entire game without killing anyone. The way you play the game also affects how the ending will turn out. You are also able to use certain powers, some of these powers can be used for a stealthy approach, some can be used to kill.   This game has some glitches and bugs which I find a bit frustrating. Dialogue between NPC is cut whenever you are being detected by them. The dialogue does not countinue from where it stopped once they return back to their un-alerted state. There are also situations where something you haven not done is count as a kill, which is frustrating if you are trying to achieve a playthrough without killing anyone. It is also hard to recognize some of the NPCs' who will be alerted by your presence, and those who will not.  To conclude this short review: I believe this game is a good investment, since it offers great diversity in playstyle and player based choices. The story is also very good. The things I found negative about the game are minor. As a side note I want to mention that I have not experienced any major problems with this game (only very few crashes, as expected).

            "review_text": "As a TL;DR for this review, I absolutely reccomend this game for anyone looking for an alternate art style game that delivers compelling stories with perfectly crafted combat and movement systems.  Dishonored, a game created by Arkane Studios, delves into the world of Corvo Attano, a highly respected assassin who must take back Emily Kaldwin, the kidnapped daughter of Jessamine Kaldwin. Using stealth or outright combat, along with a powers tree that is determined by the player, Corvo must make his way through multiple levels to silence those who oppose him, or to find out information of Emily's whereabouts.  The powers allow the player to choose how they play, they can even play without them. But they supply a whole range of attacks and advantages to Corvo that will shape the game world. For example, killing multiple people will riddle the game world with rats that can attack the player, and harsher enemies. A pacifist style player will see less rats, and a calmer world to deal with. These choices of powers come at a cost.  Throughout the world, players can find runes and bonecharms, the runes will supply the player with powers that they want to use, and the bonecharms offer bonuses such as a certain skill lasting longer, or sneaking quieter. These are just few examples. There is also a currency in the game, to buy equipment and upgrade them. Stealing fancy painting or wallets off of guards without their knowledge is just one way a player can expect to make money.  Dishonored is a game that can be played in so many different ways, and can reward you for doing so. Such as achievements and equipment in the game that tailors itself to a specific playstyle. Anyone new or veteran to a stealthy game like this is easily going to fit in, with just a bit of training with the blade and powers, you'll be the next Corvo Attano.  For my summary, the game is rewarding to a player that likes good play or good story, as the game supplies both at a beautifully high standard. Whilst it may no longer be the best, most cutting edge game or engine out there, it is sure to blow the likes of gamers away with its sheer immersion.",

That's good if you liked DMMM but it's also bad because it makes Dishonored not as creative as it first appeared;  Arkane Studios reused 95% of DMMM's gameplay and mechanics. ---  Ah, Dishonored. A game that I was truly anticipating.  I thought Dishonored would be a pseudo-open world game where you roamed Dunwall and you struck at your selected targets like a vengeful spirit.  From the cinematice trailer, I was under the impression that the Outsider freed you, gave you equipment and sent you out to systematically dismatle a heartless, 1984-like, cruel government. Like a Robin Hood of sorts. You see Corvo smoothy parkour rooftops and be an unstoppable force.  Cons --- *Spoliers &lt;* What I got instead was a disappointing cabal who ordered you around and predictably, betrays you.  The Lord Regent is not a malicious, controlling man but rather simply wanted to revitalize Gristol's dismal economy by any means even if that meant removing the ignorant empress.  The targets for the most part have done nothing wrong to you personally and are only killed under the orders of the cabal to further its goals.  And finally ironically the cabal is the only target who should be killed (in high chaos)  Brigmore witches dlc's Corvo does not follow your Corvo's choices *&gt; Spoliers* Also certain sounds, esp NPC sounds are too loud and repetitive.   The AI also is incredibly blind, dumb and deaf: They don't look up, cannot see through glass, don't notice missing objects, don't see thrown objects, cannot hear explosions down the street and have never eaten a carrot in their lives.  The game is very linear and there is no 'mid-chaos' ending.  The levels are too enclosed, rooftops are usually inaccessible so too much time is spent on the ground and very annoyingly, the game often funnels you to certain areas - as in a certain objective/location is only accessible through one path.  Also you are not as 'smooth' as the Corvo in the trailer and are quite clumbersome and have to rely on blink much too often.  The AI can dodge, bash, kick and throw grenades/shoot simultaneously etc while you cannot  The swords reach farther than their models  The Knife of Dunwall dlc - you don't feel like daud  The lore can be easily ignored while still understanding the plot  too easy to counter attack via blocking  Pros --- Overall good quality  Swordfighting is brutal &amp; intense on the appropriate difficulty.  Brigmore witches dlc  Atmosphere and art design  Final Verdict: I was going to give it a 9/10 when I first started the game 6.5/10 by the time I finished it.",

You quickly gain access to a selection of tools and abilities that support all of the possible approaches such as sleep darts, proximity mines or mind control.  There are at least 2-3 really different play throughs here for those who want to try all the approaches and earn all of the achievements.

The story and the way it's presented is a lot of fun. Also unique is there are different endings depending on your play style. Keep the killing to a minimum and you'll get the 'happy' ending. Kill a lot of people and you'll get the not so happy ending. I went with low kills but it was a lot of fun sneaking up on guys and choking them out. In many ways, this a spiritual sucessor to Thief 2. The sneaking &amp; the looting remind me of that game moreso than Thief 3 did (and Thief 4 from what I understand). Level design is excellent with a myriad of ways to get through them. But SAVE YOUR GAME OFTEN. I can't stress this enough because there are times you'll get past a situation and you'll mis click or the blink runs just short of where you want to go and you're surrounded. Another piece of advice. The two story DLCs are completely worth it. I'd argue 'The Brigmore Witches' DLC has the best level design in this game period and is one of the best story DLCs I've ever played. Dishonored gets an easy 10/10 from me and I'll be interested to see how Dishonored 2 compares.",

I was in London for the Eurogamer Expo 2012 and, while the twin banners hanging over Earl's Court were impressive, I was more concerned with Mass Effect, Skyrim and more established games. Belive me, it was my loss. Upon getting Dishonored on a whim at a friends recomendation I can say I regret not having paid it more attention. Really the only down points that come to mind are the occasinal silly AI stealth mechanics (though what stealth game doesn't have such problems now and then?) and the Faces. Dear god's the faces! It's like being back in TES IV: Oblivion all over again. Those aside, I can recommend Dishonored wholeheartedly to any fans of stealth shooters with a slightly darker twist to them or fans of steampunk in general (though there's no airships I'm sad to say but your goggles are kickass) The stealth mechanics (barring the odd curiosity) are good, combat is ballanced (as an assassin/bodyguard you know how to handle yourself in a fight but you're not about to take on a whole army by yourself. Not with out some mechanical toys or supernatural help) and the story line and lore are engaging. I find myself wanting to find out more about this city, this world I find myself in. And, much like Oblivion, while the faces may give you nightmares, the scenery will take your breath away. Normally I'd advise against playing any kind of sneaky stealth game in the dead of night with headphones on and lights off unless you're a die-hard horrer fan for fear of what dangerous monsters are lurking around the next corner but, in Dishonored, you are the scariest monster in the shadows. But what kind of monster? One that slaughters indiscriminately or one that slips in and out of the most secure buildings without so much as a whisper?",

Stealth and assasination in most games end up being a side thing, something as an additional objective. Normally poorly implemented. Dishonoured combines both aspects into an integral part of the gameplay, however more importantly it gives you choice.   You can go through the whole game never getting involved in any stealth, getting into multi man fights and taking everything head on, you can play as a regular assasin hiding in the shadows waiting for the time to strike.  But perhaps the one thing that seperates this game the most from any other stealth/assasination based game is the fact that you can go through the whole game without killing a single person. A game The achievement 'Clean Hands' is also a reward for doing so, never killing anyone in a game all about assasination and extensive combat.  The graphics are stylised although realistic, they are generally very nice although not the focus of the game, all the areas that you will visit are extremely detailed  The story is also excellent, although as this is a spoiler free review I cannot go into depths of what will happen or why it is great. One thing to share is how you act directly influences how the game progresses, you have small dialogue options, although those options will be signifcant and even make you pause to think on how you want to respond. Your actions also play a big role in how the game will play out.   For those that don't want to read that I will also put direct stats of what I think the game holds up to   Graphics: 8/10, instead of going for a real life look they went a stylised version Combat Gameplay: 9/10, if you love sword fights, close quarter combats or the like, you'll enjoy it here Stealth Gameplay: 10/10, one of the few games to full on hit the mark in the genre Movement/General Feel: 10/10, The parkour system works perfectly with all the abilities given Story: 10/10, the story is excellent, and changes based on even your smallest actions   Overall if this game has interested you in even the tiniest, buy it, its very cheap too even with all the DLC, look around and pick it up.",

Be aware that this game does have some horror elements in it, and they are not the type that you have to dig into to realise that they are scary. Weepers are not the nicest enemy exactly.   You dont need to enjoy stealth games to enjoy this one as it can be quite fun to just run around and acting like a badass.

If you want to spend the best £10 of your life (currently £3) then this is the thing to spend it on. Huge replayability that means even going through the levels the same way is fun and interesting side objectives that allow you to explore the whole area.

Throughout the game the story is fantastic and all the characters you meet along the way feel very life like with great voice acting and animations. The graphics are absolutely amazing, the world of Dishonored is vivid and alive in front of you. The gameplay is where the game really shines though, although I mentioned that you play as an 'assassin' you do not have to take the stealthy approach, you can simply run straight at a guard and cut him down if you wish. Maybe you want to be stealthy but ruthless, that's fine because you can sneak behind your enemy and slit his throat before he even knows you're there, or maybe you're a kind person that doesn't see the need to kill guardsmen? Great, you can render them unconcious by strangling them and then hide their body so no passing enemy will see them. Obviously, the stealthy approach is far more rewarding, as you will not have to cut your way through wave after wave of guardsmen to reach the objective.  10/10 a must have. Note: To understand the story further and to have more playtime I would highly recommend the DLC The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, 10/10 for them as well.",

Just kick in the door and start shooting with your gun, slash with your sword and summon plague-rats to eat your enemies. Don't worry about being shot! Just slow down time and dodge the bullet, after that, just slowly aim your gun on the head of the enemy, shoot and resume time again. You can even finish the game by not even getting noticed and also by not killing anyone! It's all possible!  Remember, every method takes it's time and it's skills.

In the 3rd mission in the game, you beat it, and rescue Emily, your [spoileri]daughter[/spoileri] who is kidnapped at the beginning of the game. Then, the rest of the game makes no sense, as you try to clear your name as an assassin, by murdering/kidnapping/torturing your way to freedom! Speaking of freedom, you get a lot of it. In the ♥♥♥♥ing hub map, you get an entire open world to explore! And then, the powers are the best part. Get your infinite mana mods reasy, because these powers are amazing! Example of how I used powers to assassinate a target: I teleported into a window, through a door, poisoned the target's drink, and before his asssistant could call for help, I possessed a rat, and had it maul him to death, as I used slow motion to sprint past every guard in the area, and make it to my getaway boat before I got seen. Also, not killing isn't really that big of a deal, as the main thing it does is make more rats appear, and make more people get infected by the un-named plague, which cannonically doesn't even happen, so you can happily slaughter your way to victory. And the combat definitely needed work. The block/counter attack system works well, but punishes you if you want to play the game you want, becauase if you get ganged up on, you are ♥♥♥♥ed! You can't see what's behind you, and everyone has the same uniform, so you can't tell the gun wielding soldier from the normal minions, which makes sense realistically, but not gameplay wise imo.

I've killed or nocked out characters in multiple ways over and over just to see if there was going to be an actual consequence. I was under the assumption as i was playing the it was a sort of choose your own adventure style of gameplay. It's not. Ultimatly you are given limited choices, just to further the main story. There are some side quest but the don't affect the gameplay in the least. At most you'll get an achievment for it. Towards the end of the game, I was all out of supplies except for 2 grenades. Since your put in a ituation where you can't exaclty gear up near the end, I thought I might have to start at a previous checkpoint. Now I always play every game on the most difficult setting, even if I've never played the genre before. Playing this game though, it gives you multiple options to get through levels. I was able to sneak around and get the upper hand in the end. So in that respect I think this game is great.  The fighting is questionable at best. I don't like the fact that in order for me to go full assault i am required to buy upgrade after upgrade. At no time did it appear that any of my enemies feared death. I would be surrounded, hit the first guy and then get shot in the head. Since I was on a high difficulty, getting into a sword fight was not a smart option as the NPC's can dodge for days. I was usually reduced to sneak attacks. Tall boys were the bain of my exestince in this game. The only advice I could give is to get to a high vantage point or stock up on explosives.  Is the story worth it.... No. Not at all, it's nothing special and there are a lot of plot holes and unresolved questions. If anything if you want to play thing gme, play it for the powers.

After 3 hours, the most notable thing is that stealth is very slow as I'm still working on the first mission after the 'tutorial' mission. Stealth is also very unrewarding, for example a house I went into as a side objective had 5 copies of the same key in various places, one or two per floor. After carefully incapacitating the person who had the one I picked up hanging off his belt, I was somewhat unpleased to find more just waiting for a thief to snatch up.  About an hour later, after finally beating the side objective, I was moving forward to the next side objective and had hidden myself underneath a platform, in a dark crawlspace below. Opposite my entry point, an enemy immediately spotted me through the solid wood and engaged in combat. The mechanics are all there, but they seem not to function correctly.  I ended this playthrough when I encountered one last failed mechanic. I managed to sneak up behind an enemy, more than close enough to reveal the stealth incapacitate icons, and held down control. I blocked since it was bound to the same button, but never took down the enemy. Confused, I tried again, same results, and then this guy turned around to continue his patrol and found me waving my sword around like an idiot.  The man then began trying to dice me up, but I took him down easy. Oddly, even though he never once said a word and didn't scream when he died (like stealth kills produce) three other men showed up.  I am a fan of stealth games, having enjoyed a couple Metal Gear Solids in the past, but though this one portrays itself as a stealth game I will be going in guns blazing, else it might take a month to beat the game.",

I got close to completing the first mission where I was supposed to kill some religious leader V for Vendetta style, I did the ole' switch'a'roo of the drinks, and then waited. I waited, and waited, and went out, killed some more guys, came back in and waited. Turns out that if you don't play the game the way it wants you to, it takes all of its toys and goes home.  The religious leader guy and his compatriot he planned on poisoning just stood in their room the whole time, complaining about the weather, and about the progression of the World Cup. So they never came out, and after hours of play, I decided that for all its uniqueness, this game gets a 'thumbs down.' Sure, it's graphically stellar, but the missions were too linear, the story was bland and torn out of the pages of several different movies and games, and the dialog, oh lawdy, the dialog. Every character sounds similar, and the dialog felt stilted and disjointed.  It could have been an amazing game, but the dialog and gameplay were bland and boring, and the bug that broke my mission was the final straw.",

This really hurts when you hit the invisible walls at the top or sides of the map, or just look in the distance to find cardboard cutout buildings isntead of real models.   Many levels have really clear A, B, or C type choices for pathways, so where you would like to be creative and find new solutions, you kinda get kicked into the mold.

It takes a little from several games and doesn't really do anything special with it. Like Bioshock the world created is beautiful and the stealth mechanics are at least on par with Dues Ex, but no were as good as Thief (1998). While not exactly groundbreaking, Dishonored is still an interesting game for Bethesda fans or fans of Bioshock or Deus Ex.  Is it good? ================= Powers are interesting and the horribly overpowered Blink can be quite a lot of fun. The world does look great, despite the character models. There's also the option of neutralizing your targets by methods other than murder, which is something I'd like to see more in games. There is also a lot of story worth reading in books and notes scattered throughout the game, giving the world created a much lived in feel similar to Bioshock. There are a lot of great conversations and recordings in the game as well, with my favorite being when the guards were talking about how Corvo was probably hiding somewhere near them.   Does it have any problems? ======================== I can't really say it's boring, but the story certainly was. When the 'twist' came up, it was expected and I was a little disappointed that I had obviously finished that much of the game so quickly. It didn't help that we have yet another silent protagonist, which makes it tougher to care. The morality system was a major source of contention for me. For starters, it affects Emily's actions and outlook, and it bothers me that it's not explained how she or anyone else found out about whether or not anyone died. Sure, it could have been overheard, but with the ruling power being like it is, that's the sort of propaganda they're likely to spit out, regardless of what happened. Secondly, Corvo is frequently referred to as an assassin, but killing is what you get punished for. I should add that if you decide to go the non-lethal route, you'll be very limited in your choice of weapons.  Art style for the characters is pretty terrible with the exception of Emily and the Empress. Maybe this was done to reflect how monstrous the new regime is and if that's the case, congratulations are in order.   Final Thoughts! ==================== To sum up, it's not a terrible game, but doesn't really deserve to be compared with the titans that are frequently mentioned. Certainly not worth paying full price for, just wait until there's a huge discount on Steam. I'd give it a 3.5, but I don't have that option.  Edit: Personal insults don't explain why you like it or why I'm wrong. Secondly, these are opinions which will vary wildly depending on the experience of the user. I have received many personal insults for giving this game a ‘Not Recommended’. Any one leaving personally insulting comments will be deleted.",

Despite all this, this was by far the easiest stealth game I've ever played. The character is just so overpowered there's no challenge to the game whatsoever, even on the hardest difficulty. Those 12 hours I played? This is the time it took me to 100% the game on the hardest possible setting, DLC excluded.  The game also has a useless currency system in the sense that I used it once to upgrade my boots, and never used it again since there wasn't anything else that benefits stealth  Plus if you're an achievement fan, you'll be disappointed since the game is terribly bugged and decides randomly whether you've killed someone or got detected once you finish a level, so it'll take multiple playthroughs and a lot of luck to finally get that nice perfect run achievement... guess that's Bethesda's idea of having replayability value.  UPDATE: Tried playing the DLC figuring it'd be more functional but nope. Knocked an enemy unconscious, he burst into flames and died, a guard at the end of the map saw that and rang an alarm that wasn't anywhere near him.

At the end, what we got here is as entertaining as an average game for your smartphone, just a way to pass the time. It does not deserve its impressive rating.  Some dare to compare this game with Deus Ex. Did you consider Deus Ex has musics? The only one I spotted in Dishonored was when I was chased by rats. Did you consider Deus Ex does not have a 'Purchase downloadable content' on its main screen? That Deus Ex characters don't feel the need to pee every 30 seconds?  The main flaws of the game according to me:  The Dark Vision, a tool which allows you to see enemies as well as objects through walls is so essential for the game you have to always let it activated. Too bad it turns your vision into a monochromatic one which turns annoying quite quickly. Maps without it look good more often than not, and yet you're almost obliged to turn them into shades of orange.  The city watch guards are extremely annoying. If you choose to have a stealth/strategic approeach instead of them running into them and killing them, you'll have to see and hear them pee every 30&nbsp;seconds, repeating the same few sentences throughout the whole game ('Do you think you'll get your own squad after what happened last night?', 'Never doubt it.').  The game has a pseudo-freedom where you can choose to kill people or not yet you're often obliged otherwise incited to steal them. From the screen at the end of the map which display the money you found out of all the money in map without any distinction between found and stolen money, to the fact holding an inconscious/dead body makes you take their money without any choice, this game just offers a highly inconstistent freedom of having a moral or not.  Voice-acting is exagerated, sometimes unbearable like the voice of the heart, a feeling aggravated by the fact she says ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and uninspired stuff ('this place is the end of all thing… and the beginning').  Emily, a character you're obliged to help even though there's almost no reasons in the world not to hate her.   The level design, often great, is sometimes very repetitive.  Now the game gives you the illusion of freedom of movement, yet you're often blocked by invisible walls when you want to explore too much.  It also tries to make you identify to the character you're playing in the same way Half-Life does, except you lose the control of your character in some cinematics, seeing him doing actions which you may not have thought of (like holding the hand of Emily).  I genuinely tried to like this game, but at the end, the only thing I remembered from it was frustation and boredom.",

For a game that at the time cost between £30-40, this game really is not value for money.   The game itself starts off strong, seemingly offering a variety of paths, both in how to complete your mission and how to play the game.   You play as Corvo, the bodyguard to the Empress of a steam punky like empire who's main source of fuel is whale oil. Shortly after returning home from a mission, the Empress is assassinated (good work bodyguard), and her daughter and heir abducted. It turns out the assassins hired to kill the Empress and kidnap her daughter were hired by a triumvirate of high ranking members of the Empire who frame you for the crime.   Naturally, you escape and try to avenge the Empress, save the Empress' daughter and clear your name.   Storywise, the game is pretty solid, a little clichéd if you want to be overly critical, but nothing majorly is wrong with the story.   To me however, the story is the strongest thing going for the game.   Most missions can be completed in a variety of ways, ranging from killing people, which effects the game's ending, rendering them unconcious, which also effects the game's ending, or sneaking past them entirely. You can even choose to spear all the traitors who framed you, fancy that.   However, the game's combat is notably easy. You are given a pretty impressive arsenal of weapons, that means even if you are caught out of stealth, you can defend yourself more than admirably, or simply run off. Furthermore, the leveling system allows you to purchase spells, that only increase your level of power, from having people consumed by rats, to blinking silently around the map.   If you are really bad at the combat, constantly getting caught while hiding and can't get the hang of the spells there is one final tactic you can employ. Running. And I don't mean 'I'll run away, lose them and come back.' you can literally just sprint past enemies, most of which are armed with swords and you seem to be faster than them anyway, from start to finish. I found, even on the last mission, that I could simply run through enemies who took so long to notice me I was half way down the corridor by the time they began chase, and almost out of sight by the time they started running.   The endings also seem a bit generic, but I shan't get into them for that would be a massive spoiler.",

Dishonored is a fantastic mesh of old-school Thief games with a pinch of Assassin's Creed and possibly a few other great games I can't recollect or may have not played yet. The storyline, though others on the reviews will say is so-so, isn't so-so at all. It's not the best in the world, but it fits the world of Dishonored quite well, and that world is something nearly created from scratch. As a kid, watching fantasy-based Disney films or any other sort of animated or live-action movie not necessarily taking place on earth was a truly amazing experience. The experience of being transported to those other worlds with a child's impenetrable imagination to real life distractions. As an adult, I find it difficult to do that without a lot of effort, but Dishonored made me feel like a kid again in respect to losing my surroundings and traveling somewhere else for a spell. And the replayability is extremely high due to the multiple (more than two) ways to complete a mission. The nice touch being most of the assassinations don't have to end with an actual death, however the non-lethal route ramps up the challenge in a very fitting manner.   10/10, not going to say something that rhymes with ten at the end....here.",

You can ignore the time i have speant on this game from here, as i played it for a lot longer on the ps3  Dishonored is a supernatural stealth action exploration assassin simulator. And so far i still have not tired of this game. I have played all of the missions many many times. And i am still finding new rooms new places and sometimes even new side objectives. Even with playing it repeatedly i am still able to be creative 'sadistic' with my killings. And even creative with my evasion of detection. The graphics are pleasing to me. Very watercoloury ' thats not a word, i think' its like looking at art, All of the areas having their own aesthetics taste 'to a point'  The moral choice aspect comes in to play alot, and this is what i meant by peoples lack of understaning. SPOLIER ALERT POSSIBLY!!! The 'moral choice' aspect is not as clear cut as people think. Its not a matter of killing is bad and not killing is good. You can kill all of the main targets and no one else. And you can still get the low chaos 'good ending' What the Moral situations is. Is that You slaughter everyone. The dead bodies attract more rats. Those rats multiply Thus spreading more and more plague, All the while the empress's daughter is young and impressionalbe and all she knows is to slaughter literally everyone. This game does not speak against revenge. It more says. Don't be a ♥♥♥♥  THE DLC!! dunwall trails. Not for everyone, but i very much enjoy it. There is something within the trails for everyone, But they are only fun little minigames essentially. ' race train' Explosive pigeon shooting' Ultimate burglar simulator' Supernatural street battle simulator' Time stop chain reaction murder everyone simulator' And a few other, and even some tough to get achievments if you like that kinda thing.  Knife of dunwall. Without spoiling to much. but warning some spoilers The knife of dunwall Is a side story for Daud, the assassin who kills the empress at the start of the original game. Its actually really nice. But its much more difficult to play stealth this time, Which is either a plus or a minus. You have alot fewer ways to get from point A to point B. But you can look at it as a challange or a pain. I have found it to be both at times, There are 3 chapters with a surprising ammount of things to do in each chapter, Which may explain why there are fewer ways of going A to B because there is actually a ton of stuff that is easily missed. Its a very nice addition And as with the actual game itself. i am still finding new stuff.   The brigmoor witches. This directly follows on from the above paragraph. Again it has its challanges, Its diversity in things to actually do. And this time there are a few more ways of getting from A to B. And it nicely wraps up dauds Story as well. not too much to say other than if you enjoyed the knife of dunwall. Then you will more than likely enjoy This too",

There's not much of an emotional connection with the characters and even the world. The fact that low chaos and no killing is encouraged even in the storyline, but not rewarded with satisfying gameplay that comes from a high chaos run is also what holds this game back. This game is a good example of the inverse of Bioshock by having very fun gameplay (on higher chaos levels) with a poor storyline. Learning more about all the charaters and even the protagonist would help. Corvo either needs a stronger personality or to allow the players to project their personalities through him.  Good: -Lots of fun ways to kill people -Graphics are nice -Interesting world Bad: -Playing non-lethal is encouraged but boring -Bland story and characters, including the protagonist  I give it a 7.5/10",

After playing the game through twice there were far too many gameplay inconsistencies, idiotic development choices, etc. for me to give Dishonored a positive review.    Don't tell me I'm a badass and force me to play nice   If you've seen the trailer for Dishonored it is quite a sight. It's very well rendered, excellent voice acting, top notch action, raw and visceral both visually and emotionally. Gameplay footage showed Corvor performing unbelievably brutal assassinations, and when you play the game yourself, you over hear guards talk constantly about what an undeniable badass you are.  'You've never seen Corvo fight? The man is a whirlwind of death.' 'If you see Corvo don't try to fight him alone.' 'I saw Corvo go toe-to-toe with a weeper grizzly bear with nothing but a plastic spork.'  Then after getting out of the tutorial you realize there is a good and bad ending to the game. Every kill you do leads you down the path of the bad ending. Which is the same as losing the game in my opinion.   Don't tell me this is going to be a game about brutal vengance at the end of a sword and force me to play like a pacifist.  Playing the game this way is painfully boring as this locks you out of most of your weapons.     Dumb Development choices   Dishonored sports a power system similar to Bio Shock or Deus Ex. Runes/skill points are spent to unlock and upgrade ablitilies.  In addition to this you find bone charms which are amulets that Corvo can equip to give him passive buffs.  There are 35 charms total in the game and most of them are functionally worthless.  'Falling Star' Drop assassinating recharges mana by 20%.  'Clockwork Malfunction' Enemy grenades take slightly more time to explode. 'Plague Affinity' Damage by weepers grants a small amount of mana.  Falling star is incentivizing the player to do something that will hurt their chances of victory, ie: killing.  Clockwork Malfunction...if the enemy is throwing grenades at you, you're doing stealth wrong.  Plague Affinity? Who would deliberately get attacked by an  enemy to get a small amount of mana?  There are many more in the wikia but it's very clear to me  the developers didn't put much thought into Corvo's abilities or the kind of game they wanted to make.   This is further shown by the fact that this is a line-of-sight stealth game in 2014. No light meter. You just make sure a solid object is between you  and your target's vision.  Yet in the game Corvo can extinguish candles changing the lighting in a room...for some reason.  Also hand grenades and quite possibly the  loudest pistol in the world...in a stealth game?  The ending is pretty anti-climactic. Pick it up if it's 70% off or more. But it's just not a very good game.",

You have lots of 'easy' ways of doing stuff, but only a few hard ones will get you up. And yeah, it's a game, I would have definitly loved this was kinda like assassin's creed, killing and still getting the good stuff. But hey, it was totally worth it.

Both action and Stealth can be heart pounding, yet also immensly satisfying,   While Dishonored's storyline is not the greatest, it still holds its own, and is the King in terms of lpayer choice. Not only does dishonored offer different endings, but THE GAME CHANGES AS YOU PLAY, which means you get to experience the consequences or rewards of your actions first hand.

The Player - You get several cool powers and a large amount of minor player improvements achieved as side quests. You are also given several spy gadgets for a variety of ways to kill. The Story - The story is average, but cliche and predictable. The World - This is where the game is lacking. The world is not as open, interactive, or drenched in lore as you might like it to be. This game starts with a cool setting - an island empire, but you are confined to the handful of mission regions. In the game you have a base/home area which is much smaller than it shoudl be. The lore in this game is extremely wanting, throughout the game you can pick up TONS of notes, book pages, etc. (I read every single one for the first three missions until I realized they had very little to do with lore). Throughout the game almost no lore is revealed about key characters except that they had 'a very different and mysterious past'. The Missions - The missions allow you to get creative with your powers and gadgets, but overall they are linear. There are 9 missions in the campaign, they are each somewhat long, but it's that much worse for a game that is unforgiving if you are detected once. You will be forced to slay all the enemies that are called over to you, or reload. There really needed to be some kind of vanish ability, because blink really didn't cut it when the NPC can throw grenades at you if you try and get away to a rooftop. The Gameplay - Some of the game mechanics were really annoying. It is really difficult to act and stay hidden. You can't use many things as distractions like you would think, throwing a bottle or making something blowup far away from you can cause the NPCs to go straight to your location even if you are hidden away. I don't know why the game acts this way sometimes, while other times distractions work fine. You are given only two ways to incapacitate NPCs (not killing) shooting with sleep darts or strangling from behind. This game is mostly about waiting and being patient, (You need to save A LOT). The missions are long and one wrong move and the NPC guards are all over you. I would have enjoyed the game if it was more about stealth and less about winning fights with NPCs.  I give this game a 7.5/10",

The Action/Stealth aspect of this game can speak for itself. Gameplay is all about options: should you kill, or should you subdue? Should you act as a blood-thirsty spirit, wreaking havoc across Dunwall, or should you act as a spectral entity, accomplishing goals with minimal lethality? The options are endless; the concept is original; the combat is as fluid as you want it to be.   As for the story, I had a true sense of grief, a feeling seemingly unfamiliar to me, but strikingly nostalgic; the end of the game will also strike you the same way.

Afer completing the game using non-lethal takedowns, I found that the game was really enjoyable and found myself constantly thinking about getting back to that world, to discover more and just be part of it again.  The opening sees your lover, the Lady Empress murdered before you and her daughter taken and hidden away. Your put in prison, but you escape and that's where the game begins. It took me around 30 hours to complete the game, as I took my time and explored the world. What I found was a heavy detailed world, a world rich in history and lore. I often wanted to go and see the other places and see new people and have big adventures.  You play a High Protector uh Corvo... Jones! You play as Corvo Jones, basically a body guard to the empress and he daughter. After your escape from prison you join some others who want to get revenge on the ones that killed the empress and you are given nine targets to see fit as you choose. You can either play as a mass murderer or a silent shadow that leaves everyone alive except your targets and then, you don't have to kill then but choose to have them face a fate that would be worse than death.  After playing 108 hours, I found that the game was really quite enjoyable on three play throughts, 2 low chaos and 1 high. The sounds and art design is really beautiful, that oil painting look of the world is what keeps drawing your eye to the city scapes, or the people that inhabit the world.  Corvo Jones has a really nice movement, it's fluid and smooth and has a nice bounce when he jumps. The game ran at a steady 60fps and never crashed once. With all the details cranked up, you'll find that this game is rock steady. I use tiamat 7.1 headphones and the sound from this game is quite impressive, nice beefy lows and great stereo pleacement make this game a joy to listen and play.  What I didn't like about it was that it ended, I just wanted to stay in the world and be with the characters that inhabited my life and explore more of the city. I would highly recommend this game to anyone that likes open ended and fun gameplay.",

Each level provides a multitude of ways to gain access to the next area and complete your object, I went for the pacifistic stealth approach and tried to avoid killing, instead opting for silent non lethal takedowns, but the option is there to go in running &amp; gunning if you want. The powers system adds a great game mechanic that only adds to this, for example, you can use blink (a power that allows you to instantaneous dash/teleport to wherever your cursor is looking) to traverse rooftops and feel like a true ninja, or you can use possession to enter the body of a rat or a fish and find your way into otherwise unreachable areas through small vents &amp; tunnels. The sense of empowerment you get when fighting in combat is immense, there's nothing that makes you feel more like a bad ♥♥♥ than parrying an incoming sword attack, slowing down time to avoid a gun shot, using blink to close in on your opponents and clearing out a room without even getting a scratch. It truely is FUN to play with, and that's what the game is all about right?   The plot moves along at a decent place, unlike some games (Mass Effect 1's Citadel for example) you don't tend to get stuck in the same place for very long which avoids monotonous gameplay. The whole story of the game allows you to empathize with the lead character 'Corvo,' and really feel his desire for vengeance. My only gripe is I wish the game had been a bit longer, otherwise a great game and I hope for a sequel.",

Sneaking through streets of guards, exploring forgotten areas of an abandoned city and finding the most creative way to take down your target are the main ways to enjoy Dishonored. Getting into a showdown with a dozen guards is never anything but awkward to deal with and - quite rightly for a stealth game - has the self-imposed feeling of failure all over it.  While each mission takes place in a small open world, full of secrets to find, don't expect a massive playtime from this title; I've racked up 33 hours from two reasonably thorough playhtorughs. Speaking of two playthroughs, it should be mentioned that Dishonored proudly wears the ever-so-stylish shoulder pads of a Binary Moral Choice System. While it doesn't do alot to aid the story, it has the best gameplay implementation of a moral choice system I've ever played. Rather than basing the ending on cumulative number of kills throughout th game, Dishonored has a 'chaos' rating which can be raised or lowered from mission to mission. As well as subtly changing the game's challenge, this means you can go crazy killing during the first half of the game and still get the 'good' ending by going pascifist for the rest.  Overall, with its characatured art style, steampunk environments and truly stealth-focused design, Dishonored is a great gaming experience. Just don't expect to able to sink all you time into this title.",

Though the story is not original (you must avenged yourself and your murdered loved one), it was strong and interesting enough to keep the game going. What separates Dishonored from other stealth games is how it allows you to be as creative as you wish to complete a level. You can be either a dark assassin out for blood, a pragmatic avenger who kills only when necessary or a man who ignores the innocent but ensures that death is a gift far too merciful for those who wronged him. And that's only part of Dishonored's charms. You can use you supernatural abilities to get ahead or destroy your enemies without breaking a sweat, or simply use your mortal skills to stab or sneak past the obstacles that lay on your way or combined both if you please.  There are consequences of course for each action but that only ensures that this games replay ability. The PC version is quite decent and the art direction is amazing - combining steampunk with 19th century architecture makes for a beautiful and yet haunting City of Dunwall. Eschewing picture realism, the world is done in such a way that it evokes a paint like quality and that makes you feel as though you're playing through an oil painted canvas. The universe has its own backstory and all the little detail that makes Dishonored feel alive and creepy and so interesting to explore. This elevates the game from being just another AAA game. You want to know more than just Corvo's desire for vengeance, want to know more about the Outsider, about that mysterious assassin who murdered the Empress, why has a city once so great fell so low, what was in Pandyssia, why does Granny Rags is reduced so...and so much more.  The game mechanics are smooth and quite intuitive and despite having many abilities and skills under your belt, it never once felt confusing or bloated. The way it was designed ensures that you truly feel like a badass (sort off) assassin out for justice.   The DLC - especially Knife of Dunwall and the Brigmore Witches - are a must add. These two are what DLCs are meant to be, a worthy addition to the main game that improves the familiar and yet enhances it. I recommend for anyone who are interested to get the Dishonored GOTY edition for the fullest experience. Trust me, you won't regret it.",

Also to see how many different endings the game has.  Gameplay is smooth and easy to learn but hard to master. The stealth aspect seems to work really well and the action side of combat is great too for when you feel like running headfirst into danger. The music is spot on for building suspence as you try and stealth your way through the missions and the can cause panick when you suddenly get spotted by that guard that snuck up on you from around the corner!  Overall I would say that if you enjoyed Assassins Creed games and Skyrim (for it's combat/fps style) then this is a mixture albeit more linear of those two games in my opinion.",

            "review_text": "Dishonored is a beautiful game. The art style is magnificent and the graphics sense is phenomenal. The story is well-crafted and the gameplay is perfect. The story takes place in a plague ridden city called Dunwall, you are the bodyguard (Lord Protector) of the Empress, Jessamine Kaldwin, you, Corvo Attano, are wrongfully accused of the murder of the Empress and are required to set things right for the future of Dunwall and a 10 year old girl named Emily Kaldwin, whom you care for and protect with all your power. Dishonored has a very large variety of supernatural elements which have been given to you by an otherworldly being, The Outsider, neither good, nor evil and watches everything, including Corvo with 'great intrest' and sometimes gives you clues if you explore the world enough. The game has a very clever 'Chaos' system that is the pinnacle between evil and good, Low Chaos: your allies will be more friendly, there will be less guards, less rats and less weepers (plague victims), High Chaos: More rats, more weepers, more guards and allies will be less grateful for your help, this gameplay mechanic is very important, which I really like.   The game is ridiculously easy though, once you have collected enough Runes to buy all the Powers, you can kill everyone instantly before you can say 'The Outsider's Mark', but I have recently completed the game without killing anyone and it's safe to say the game offers a lot more challenge if you try the game that way without killing every enemy in your path, and I prefer not killing anyone.  Then there's the case of glitches which I'm glad to say that Dishonored has literally none, unless you count the ragdoll physics if you put them in a certain object incorrectly and a bizarre texture pop-in on peoples faces, even if you're staring right at them which is pretty weird.  Overall, Dishonored is amazingly made and deserves much more attention from gamers than it has since it came out, it may be very short and easy but it's damn well fun and in my all-time favourite games, well done Arkane. My final opinion and verdict for this game is a generous 8/10, if it wasn't so short and the texture pop-ins and the varius other minor problems, I would be giving this masterpiece 10/10, hopefully Arkane can fix all these minor problems in Dishonored 2, which I am extremely hyped for! (Don't mess it up Arkane, me and the rest of the Dishonored fans are counting on you!)  People who enjoy a gripping story, strong stealth elements and extremely open exploration then you guys NEED to pick up this game, you won't regret it, trust me. For new players, enjoy it!",

Gameplay: Definitely not bad. remaining undetected is pretty tedious and time consuming. The game rewards you for being stealthy and fighting is just the worst. The most thrilling part of gameplay is using your special abilities to circumvent enemies.  Graphics: A little dated by now, but pretty good for 2012. If my eyes don't deceive me, it's on the Unreal 3 engine, so it looks very similar to BioShock infinite with it's comic-book feel. I personally like the way it looks, but it's not for everyone. Just look at the damn screenshots.  Sound: Music and SFX are on point. Not amazing, but done very well. You get a very immersive experience, and the sound plays a huge role. Some SFX can get a little repetitive such as the 'See through walls' spell that makes the same 'RASH LICE!' sound EVERY TIME you activate it, which is frequently.

It's very different from most games out there, and you can tell that the developers put a lot of thought into it.  From a gameplay standpoint, I loved it. This game gives you the freedom to play it one of two ways; stealthily, which is always my preference, or you can go in 'guns blazing' and kill everyone that stands in your way. Either way, it's hella fun, and I didn't find myself running into too many bugs or weird glitches that hampered gameplay.  Visually and auditorily, this game is great. On ultra settings that game comes to life and looks pretty fantastic. The in-game sound effects are on point as well, and pair together with the graphics to create an immersive atmosphere.

You really feel like you're in a crappy, dying dystopia that's been struck with the plague.  Gameplay is pretty fun. There's stuff that you'd expect in a stealth game. Stuff like shadows affecting gameplay, sneaking, and detection from enemies if you're too loud. But the fact that you have magic to teleport, summon rats, stop time and other stuff at your disposal makes this game unique.  The levels for each chapter is one of it's best qualities because unlike other stealth games where the route is always the same, the levels in this game are designed to have multiple entrance ways, routes and methods of infiltration. With this trait, exploring the map is encouraged, especially if you're planning to do a 'no detection' route.  Another cool thing about this game is the chaos system that's implemented into to game. In a way, it could be compared to the karma system like in the PS3 game 'inFamous' (another favourite game of mine). The thing is... the amount of chaos you accumulate throughout your walkthrough not only affects the outcome of the game but it also determines the condition of the world. High chaos (kill lots) makes the world more crappier than it already is and more enemies are present (makes sense, cutthroat on the loose = more guards), while low chaos (no killing) makes the mood less depressing and less enemies are present. Long story short: your actions shape the fate of the world and its citizens.  But it's not a perfect game... it has a flaw: the story.  The story is decent, the classic 'I got blamed for someone's murder and now I'm out for revenge' type of story, but the problem is that there is only 10 story missions. Sure there are DLCs that sort of extend the story, but it just felt like it could've done better (like maybe add a M. Night Shyamalan-esque twist).   I would like to talk about the characters, but I suck at describing them.  Long story short:  Game is great  Go buy it if you haven't.",

Sneak around and diplomatically get rid of your enemies, or exact revenge with a bloodbath and plague of ravenous, infected rodents. The choice is yours.

There are almost always several ways to go about traversing the levels, or taking out enemies creatively. The only thing I wish was a bit more in-depth is the detection system; it's so close to being very realistic (it's the best I've seen in any narrative-based game), but there are slight occasions in which I feel like AIs see me too easily, or don't see me at all.

Don't get me wrong, it's a well made game, but put it on your wishlist and wait for it to go on sale, so if you hate it, you won't hate yourself.  When I first started the game, I tried to be all stealthy and get the highest scores, but toward the end I was so bored of it that I was just running through levels, slaughtering enemies as fast as I could. You won't be able to exercise all of your options with the first playthrough, which is where the replay value comes in. There are plenty of achievements for you hunters out there, but it's not my bag.   When it's all said and done, yes, I would recommend this game... IF you can get the GOTY for less than $20.",

As I've said, it's not because there's anything wrong with the stealth per se. It's difficult to play this as a stealth game because the combat is just so satisfying, moreso the later in the game you are, when you're blinking around the map, possessing your enemies to make them shoot their friends and jerry-rigging the traps that were set to kill you so that they instead kill everyone that isn't you.

The game can end in multiple different ways.  You can cast a spell where you can stop time and walk around enemies frozen in time, plucking bullets and arrows from the air. You can teleport from ledge to ledge, shadow to shadow, as you stealthily move closer to your objective. And you WILL feel a rush of wonderful excitement upon success in this game, a success that comes often but must be worked for.

            "review_text": "want to be sneaky? get this game. Unlike many stealth based games this one is actually really good. You have a lethal and non-lethal option and everything has an effect on how the city will be. The graphics are strange at first but you will come to love and truly appreciate the unique art style of this game. I am almost done with the story but have not unlocked all the powers to make a comment but the ones I did use/upgrade were great. At first I was playing this game thinking I was stuck to the ground. However this game has a very well implemented vertical aspect. The game is wondefully designed for you to think on how to approach each enemy (or walk around). The setting, the story, the gameplay is all wondeful. My few complaints would be if they wanted you to be able to go guns blazing and swords swinging a little more effort could have went to combat but I barely fought anyone so this is not a big deal. Also a little short so play on hard difficulty. Another small qualm would be to include being able to see your legs as this would make it easier to traverse thin obstacles but again minor and no impact on the game. This game has a great story and the bethesda charm: amazing setting and story, great supernatural powers, lots of hidden items, backstory upon backstory with tons of things to read, graphics that definitely are not the most realistic or the best but still manage to create an amazing world like most bethesda games. If you are planning on buying a stealth game or playing Dishonored 2 when it comes out BUT THIS GAME. I paid about 5 bucks and was one of the best summer sale games I purchased this year.",

Enviornements are nice and open, with several differant ways to complete your objective. I bring this up first, because that's one of the best parts of the game.   The story is about an assassin/bodyguard named Corvo, who's set out to right the wrongs that were done to the royal family he was supposed to protect. You get a sword, a gun, and plasmid-like (read: Bioshock) powers that let you do super human things. This leads in to the stealth aspect. All objectives give you a wide open path that you can choose to roll right up, unload your old timey pistol, and swordplay your way through a sea of corpses. You can also use your powers to teleport, possess people and animals, and slow down time to stealthily move past enemies. Or hell, do both. That's what I did.  This game is great. It goes on sale all the time, so you owe it to yourself to spend the 5 bucks or whatever and pick it up. It's a solid ten-hour romp with decently fleshed out characters, and a pretty good plot.",

            "review_text": "It draws immediate comparisons to the Thief series, but doesn't quite earn the pedigree. The problem with throwbacks is that they often dredge up vestigial gameplay quirks without managing to solve them in light of more recent game design. Mark of the Ninja, a standout among its stealth contemporaries, sees fit to exhume and discard most of its roots; what results is a much-needed course correction on how stealth games approach the ebb and flow of tension.  In the past, as it is with Dishonored, stealth games suffered from an emergent reliance on the player's foreknowledge of levels in order to succeed. Patient players who observed their surroundings could get by if they were not bothered by the glacial pace of such an approach, but the impulse to quick-load once spotted by a guard remained, especially in first-person stealth games.  Not that Arkane doesn't try to solve these issues; it's just that their approach is often self-defeating. Protagonist Corvo is is gifted with gameplay amenities such as Blink (the ability to teleport a short distance) and Time Freeze. He is also much more lethal than the stealth protagonists that came before him--a skilled player can dispatch several guards with ease, while such odds would mean certain death for the Thief series' Garrett.  While it is absurdly easy for the player to shoot and stab their way across Dunwall, the designers clearly want you to be sneaky. Killing people in Dishonored produces Chaos, the byproduct of the game's rudimentary moral calculus. So while the player can easily survive a run-in with a guard if they are spotted, the only real choice they are left with--despite the slew of abilities available to them--is whether or not to quick load the last save and try again.   In the end, the game's stubborn insistence on almost entirely diegetic stealth feedback negates any advantage the player might have had with Blink, etc. One wonders why they didn't go even further and write quick loading into the game narrative with a Foresight ability, ala Prince of Persia or Braid. At least then a game where the goal is to be stealthy--but getting caught is of little consequence--would respect my time.",

This is heavily thanks to the multiple aproaches and player freedom)  Negatives:  - It is a bit short ( As I said above I am 2/3 through and this was done in an evening and a day. there is dlc that will expand the game by quite a few hours each that I will check out in the future.

Definitely gonna try another run of the game to try out the different ways the game can end up.  The downside to stealth games would have to be the dumb enemies. Right now, pretty much all games can't do it, but it's probably because it would be more fun that way, so it can't be helped.  Would definitely recommend.

It plays similarly to Bioshock but has stealth elements. TL:DR No spoilers = You play through a semi-open world assassinating conspiritors, you can choose to spare them or kill them in cold blood. You also have the choice between stealthily sneaking through, killing everyone, or any mixture in between.  If you enjoyed Bioshock, Metro 2033, or just about any stealth game you'll enjoy this little gem.  I'm sorry for the original bad review Arkane, my computer was just dumb apparently &lt;/3",

It's like they designed this to be a first person shooter, then penalized you for killing anyone and slapped on stealthy so it wouldn't have to compete with Call of Duty.  While the art does have it's own intricate style, it's set back in the stoneage by cartoony characters which cycle through a very tiny limited set of animations.  My recommendation: play Thief instead. Even with the annoying loading screens and a story that wasn't as strong, the elements of actual game play were just better.

Dishonored is a first person stealth and action based game set in a steampunk universe. You play the role of Corvo Attano, a man who was in the wrong place at the wrong time and mistakingly accused of murdering the Empress. You will encounter many types of levels, all ripe with a wide variety of ways to accomplish the mission. Each level is filled with interesting characters that have unique dialogue options ('Shall we gather for whiskey and cigars tonight?'). Corvo has a large arsenal of weapons that range from his trusty sword to a pistol, all of which can be upgraded to your liking.  On top of the standard weapons, there are also supernatural abilities. These powers add a new level of creativity to an already stellar game. Just like the weapons, they can be upgraded in whichever way the player chooses. The story takes place in the city of Dunwall, an environment that is battling the rat plague. The environment that you explore will reveal the past of Dunwall and give you insight into individual's lives and how they endure the plague. The one thing that many people worry about on the PC is graphics and optimization. I am happy to say that this game passes with flying colors in both sections. The graphics are absolutely stellar considering it being released in 2012. You will also have no trouble running this game because the requirements are not demanding.   With all of this in mind, Dishonored is an amazing game. It is absolutely worth the $10 that the game is set at right now. Dishonored 2 comes out November 11th, 2016 and I would highly recommend buying Dishonored and playing it. If you want to save money, you can Dishonored 2 before it comes out and obtain access to Dishonored Definitive Edition which has all available DLC. Dishonored easily earns a 10/10.",

However, everything is clearly laid out and the age of the game doesn't hinder the experience at all.   The gameplay is very smooth and all the moves and actions have a nice flow to them. The skill-ceiling is also very high but it won't discourage bad players. You can be an animal like me and do every mission with 'high chaos' or you can improve your skills and be completely stealth. The game enables you to go either way both of which seem very satisfactory.  The story is great in my opinion and during the ending credits it left me hungry for more (good thing Dishonored 2 is just a few days away!). You do have to face some ethical dilemmas, however I don't think they affect the course of the game very much. The way the story is told is making you want to play the next mission ASAP as you want to see what happens next.   As for the duration, I did my first run in 20-21 hours, with lots of wandering around looking for coins, elixirs, runes etc but with almost no reading. If you start reading all the notes you find and If you are dead serious about stealth, this game will last you long enough.

Maybe it's because I'm more used to not hearing Corvo speak, or maybe it has something to do with Boyle masquerade where you can walk amongst members of high society without being reported to guards as long as you don't go places you don't belong.   Dishonored is definitely a game that I would spend more hours on, and I will spend more hours. It's something I always find new ways to play. It's a game that I would recommend to anybody.  ",

You have a lot of hours to play if you just bought the base game, but if you did get the DLC's then you are going to have a good time as the DLC's are very good and each one gives you a nice chunk of playthrough.

Corvo's blink is an idea of genius on a par with Half Life 2's gravity gun. Other tricks like summoning rats or the DLC's grab/pull are gifts that keep on giving, and the controls are bang on the mark. This is one of those games where you soon begin to feel like a god, toying with your enemies and deciding which swift, horrible fate each one will meet at your hands. 'Watch me take that blade from you', says a semi-friendly NPC in an atypical lull in the carnage. Just you bloody try, mate. You have no idea what I can do. 9/10.  DLC: I can't imagine why anyone would want to play Dunwall City Trials: it's no substitute for a game (1/10). Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches are better, but lack the gravity of the main game. Irritatingly, both steal levels from the main game to prop up the content. Frankly, I'd rather just play the main game again, but thinking back to the soulless tat of Thief 4, they're still getting 7/10.",

Was very pleasently surprised.  Loved the story, I could choose to take lives or spare them. That's a good feeling of power in a video game. In other games a lot of times youre pigeonholed.  Your actions actually affect how characters behave, change the world and how characters view you as a person.  This was awesome and realistic, vs other games try to give an illusion of affect. This felt genuine and made sense.  Some philosophical questions were raised, and the game made me think a bit between what was right, and what was wrong.  Sometimes whether revenge is worth the sacrificing of your own humanity?  I loved that I could play the game how I wanted to like the Developers said.  Didnt need to be stealthy, didnt need to be rambo. I chose to be inbetween and just use two powers whole playthrough.,  Overall, awesome game, what a surprise, and enjoyment. Make sure to play the Knife of Dunwall and Witches DLC, they set up story for DIshonored 2.  ",

The open levels and freedom to approach in ways you want to left me very satisfied. I've bought Dishonored 2 now, and then once I've played that as a pacifist, I'll come back to this and do a high chaos playthrough and then also play the DLC that I've heard nothing but praise about.

Or will you cut a swath of carnage until all fear your name?  The choice is yours...  The game does a good job, it doesn't railroad you into being a good guy, or a bad guy. Instead it has a moral system. Killing people leads to darker outcomes.  Yes, you can argue it's artificial, but the city does have The Black Plague, so the more dead bodies there are, and the more paniced the citizens are, the more chaos and disorder allows the plague to run rampant.  The only real criticisms of the game, are that it's short. So get the Game of the Year edition, which has like 3 times the content for only like $10 more.

Even once completed, the diversity of playstyles and methods of mission execution make a second playthrough a very different experience.   Dishonored came out in October 2012, but given that no real revelations in DX11 have transpired, the game doesn't look the slightest bit dated. The only things that in any way detracted from the game were very occasional points were music will play too loudly almost drowning out a narritive, or as I experienced at the end of the main campaign, a very strange area trigger causing the end boss to active their final speach before I was even in sight.  Despite getting the game on sale, I'd say it's worth the full current price.

Play this game as you like and enjoy its story, for which the two DLCs 'The Knife of Dunwall' and 'The Brigmore Witches' are more than suggested.",

The characterization, let alone amazing voice acting makes the world of Dunwall very enjoyable. The plot however seems a little too repetitive. Each mission consists of going to location of target, killing target, leaving. The stealth system is rather unrealistic. It involves walking a good distance away from guards, and, depending on your play style, either killing them when you have the chance, or avoiding them all together. A good distance from guards is so close to them that they'd have to be deaf to not hear you. They also don't have peripheral vision. As long as you don't stand in front of them or sprint near them, you should be fine. As for hours, Dishonored is a little short. There is no multiplayer, and the DLCs won't stimulate you for long. On the up side, Corvo and Daud's* powers make you feel powerful. Dishonored's game-play, maps, easy stealth, graphics, and characters make for a very fun stealth game. I would definitely recommend to stealth fanatics.   (*refer to DLCs)",

Dishonored takes the best things from Thief and Deus Ex and combines them into a original and beautiful game.   The city in which you apply your craft and upgradable abilities is inspired from London and Edinburgh.  I found myself playing a more stealth approach and have no complaints about the length of the game, however if you were to go around executing any moveable object you might complete the game rather rapidily. Even though i seemed to play with a more stealth approach, I did to stray from this path as you can kill in the most imaginable ways. Attaching spring razors to rats and watch them kill a room full of people is rather satisfying.  I wasn't expecting much from Dishonored, but was blown away.",

            "review_text": "Dishonored is a stealth action adventure video game developed by Arkane Studios and published by the very reputable Bethesda Softworks. I picked it up over the Christmas period and honestly, I didn't expect great things. I've played it on console and felt it was very slow and 'clunky'. Although I have been converted, this title is well worth your time.  In a nutshell, and without spoilers. Your a bodyguard, Corvo, protecting an Empress, and she winds up being assasinated on your watch. Her daughter (heir to the throne) is kidnapped and your framed for the crime. I have to say that although the plot makes sense and is somewhat enjoyable, is escalates to quickly. In a matter of two missions you have went from humble bodyguard to reknowned assassin, it's just unrealistic. On the other hand, the game is quite short so maybe we can forgive them this time.  Dishonored is set in a fictional British area with a theme that can only be described as steampunk. With settings on high expect great looking visuals and a very fluid gameplay experience. I believe this game is very open-ended in that the player can attack a level in any way he sees fit, as an extensive arsenal allows for both a covert and guns blazin' approach. During my first playthrough I have chosen to go with the former. However as with most stealth games, expect to be spending up wards of an hour and a half to do an entire mission in a stealthy fashion. In my eyes this is part of the fun and can be very rewarding when you accomplish a task that at first glance seems impossible. In some levels, I had compelted the main objective in 20 minutes, but optional objectives and side missions gave the level an extra hour of playtime at least. Side missions also add another flavour to Dishonored and can be easily overlooked without a degree of curiosity. They enable the player to attack objectives in different ways or gain advantages they would otherwise not have had.  The heart of this game lies with the gameplay, it is excellent. Few games in the sub genre can give the player so much freedom in the routes they take, the way they do things and even how they take out (or in some cases don't take out) the target. Arkane studios have achieved this through superb level design that beautifully complements the supernatural 'powers' Corvo picks up. These powers are the life blood of dishonored and enable the player to have an unique experience and mold their playthrough around their play style. Powers can be unlocked and later upgraded through the currency 'runes'. Runes can be obtained in a number of different ways, as a reward, bought from certain NPC's and most frequently through exploration of the huge levels. There are a number of abilities that can be unlocked such as blink, this enables the player to instantly travel a short distance to help slip by enemies. Another would be possessing animals, or other humans.  Furthermore, Dishonored has added a system that is not found often in these sorts of games. This system is known as Chaos. At the end of each level you are given a chaos rating that is simply high, or low. This rating is based on the way you play, if you chose to kill people and be a cruel and unforgivening assailant you will be given a high chaos rating. Obviously doing the opposite will give you a low one. The rating itself not only affects the world around you (a darker world, more plague victims) but it also changes the ending to the game and to how some of the later missions play out. I see this as an ingenius way for Arkane studios to give their game replayability and overcome the issue of a fairly short story.  To conclude, the reviews here simply aren't long enough to go into depth about all the features that are an offer ( i.e.upgrades, blueprints, collectibles) but I highly recommend Dishonored to those who are fans of these titles and people who enjoy a challenge. At heart it is a fun, deep experience with a strong gameplay mechanic and a lot of replaybility. It is beautiful game and expect to be playing the game for 8 - 14 hours depending on how you play. The narrative may be lacking in length and plot but this is a very minor fault and is easily overlooked. Enjoy!",

The controls, powers, and gadgets all feel great and the mechanics themselves are awesome too short of enemy AI (then again it's a stealth game so this is fairly natural.) Ways to complete missions are varied and fun although do yourself a favor and play it through stealthily, it's no fun to rush it and fight everyone to the death. With that said there are a couple issues mostly dealing with your skillset. While there are a plethora of skills to use in your playthrough many of them can simply break the game or parts of it. One of them turns people you kill into ash that blows away which removes the purpose of hiding or disposing bodies. Likewise your gear for a stealthy aproach gets restricted as many powers are focused on rushing in and fighting and several weapons are the same. If they had simply given all the love and attention to stealth, and left fighting as a difficult yet possible alternative it woulda been better in the end. 9/10 for those who like numbers to their games.",

            "review_text": "This game...I really wanted to love. I really did, and in many ways I still do! It is a new IP, it has stealth and moral choice elements in it, The world changes in ways that are so unique and subtle! But...Why did I not care what happens? Dishonored is a game where you play a bodyguard who does horribly at his job, as in the first few minutes playing as him you do not save the Emperoress from being stabbed and her daughter from being kidnapped. Oh, and you are accused of murdering her for reasons no one makes clear...Okay. So you escape prison...a long time later, and gain supernatural powers from a guy (who might be the devil in this world, not sure) Who does it because EH, WHY NOT. So you go on a quest to reclaim your honor...whatever the cost. Now, the game is fantastic in so many ways. The combat feels incredibly fluid, in both stealth and direct approaches, and your ability to teleport across sneaking points above people creates a sense of tension and drama where you must time your powers carefully and wisely. The ways the world change are just incredibly unique and subtle in so many ways by what you choose to do, and the game's enviroment creates a truly unique experience. But my biggest problem with the game, and it is one that almost makes me not recommend it is the villians you are set against. I have never seen a bunch of the most sterotypical jerks in a video game since Hitman Absolution where you fight against a Fat Cowboy and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥/Racist Cop. Okay, I'll let you guess who the villians are from the beginning of the game. Are they the bald, old, big nosed creeps who constantly look mad and keep making statements in front of not only to their 'friends' but to the public in general to how evil they are? I mean...the target at the masquerade was someone who SEEMED very sympathic in a strange way, and seems much more like a victim then the artist/scientist who admits to torturing and experimenting on poor commoners to find a cure for a rat infestation which...is obviously caused by the villians. I know this seems really petty, as they are not suppose to be subtle or a mystery to why you should kill them or hate them, but when your roster of villians include at least 3 rapists, then you might need to give me a better reason to spare their lives then 'OH, but you are a kind soul'.  Otherwise, I remember the devil character in this game...is just so fascinating. He is a creature that gives you powers for no plot or specific reason. He just wants to see WHAT you will do with them. He doesn't care about what happens to people, he just enjoys what people do with what they are given. If they use it to create puppies for orphans, he will enjoy it. But if they also use it to create rabbit puppies that eat children, he will enjoy it just the same. I want more characters who are just that amoral.   DO I RECOMMEND THIS GAME: YES With a complex stealth system as well as a fighting system, the world it allows you to explore and navigate is truly unique and deserves a sequel that will expand on the world it created.  SUGGESTIONS (FOR GAME DEVS): Please make more subtle or relatable villians! That way, I am more willing to put effort into silently taking them out.",

You feel like you actually do something playing stealthily, rather than just sprinting around at the exact time nobody's looking (I'm looking at you, Splinter Cell games)  Your actions affect the story in a way I hadn't honestly expected, but I won't spoil that. The storyline was really interesting to me, and the gameplay was great enough to keep me going through it. The only issue I had was that, with a lack of anything new being given to you late game, it did start to feel kind of drawn out. Having everything available from the start is a great idea in concept, but in practice not so much.  The visuals were beautiful, though in this case I'm not sure I actually like that. It has a more artistic than realistic style (reminds me sort of Bioshock), and I feel being more realism based would add some much needed grit to the combat. I was expecting a very gritty game and did not recieve that, though I was pleasantly surprised with how good the actual game was.  9/10",

The story is ok, it could be more dramatic in order to add tension and surprise, but instead it feels as you are following a series of events as the story unfolds, even the plot twist is predictable and feels meaningless. One very good feature is that context shapes up based on your decisions, you can either kill or spare key targets, the city and other characters are impacted by your decisions. The variety of which you can kill key targets is also great, it invites you to check all variations, like poisoning, possessing, etc.  The ambience is one of the aspects where the game disappoints, a stealth game like this one should be dark, but most missions take place during the day, the enemies cannot see a guy in black running 1 meter from them if you are just above their heads. The AI feels very simple, guards hardly ever patrol or notice missing bodies, and they also do not react very well to thrown objects.  Complementing the AI, the map design does not allow the player to evade the enemies undetected, you will either have to use your special abilities, or knock/kill the guards. If you are playing stealthy you will find yourself spamming the blink ability, which allows you to teleport a short distance, and this feels as breaking the stealth purpose, if you do not do it, you may not proceed in certain areas due to map design and enemy placement.  Regarding maps, half of the game takes place in a small district, which is recycled for several missions. By the second or third mission you will have memorized all shortcuts and important locations, which in turn will make the following missions too easy and feel like the game is repeating itself.  The game overall is good and has a lot of creativity involved, but it is far from a true stealth masterpiece due to forced special abilities and ambience.",

Controls and smooth and fluid and so satisfying pulling off a perfectly-timed sword block or firing off that gun.   My only gripe for the game is that some of the RPG-style upgrades are underwhelming. Perhaps they didn't suit my stealth style but I didn't find I really needed any of the equipment upgrades. The ability upgrades are much the same story - several are great. Perhaps if I were to go through it again and blast my way through the game it'd be nice to have more health and more ammo for the items. But the next replay I make will be very quiet. The way it is now, they seem to really emphasize stealth and no-kill completion with rewards for such after every level and badges for completing the entire game that way. So why not add more upgrades to facilitate that when you may not ever fire a shot through the entire game? I know when I have to fire a shot, it means it's time to reload a save. Anyway all that is disappointing but nowhere near close to affecting my enjoyment of the game.  The choice to finish as a cold brutal killer or as an unseen shadow is welcome and in a world of CoD sequels and copycats this stands out as a way to do action with creativity and beauty. Take all that and set it in a game with excellent art direction and you've got youself a classic.",

Instead, a save file is created when you start each level to serve as your waypoint for return visits, meaning you will always return to that level with the same upgrades as your initial playthrough. Also, the two endings you can achieve are pretty lame for a game with so many options. If you do buy, I suggest the GOTY edition, as the DLC helps with some of the replayability issues.",

Confederate post pre future dystopia, under 1984 influenced conspiracy. This game is rather generous when you structurize yourself, even on hard difficulty. I'd purely recommend only playing it on hardest difficulty to ensure it's stealth benefits are maximized. Plenty of potions, so if you suffer conservatist item attitudes, non worries for ourselves because most of the game requires only you to think clearly and effectively. This game is intended to be played three times, for OCD, never getting caught once and another as pascifist ghost, no kills. If you're a sadist you can do both at once. If you are a professional sloppy assassin like myself, I'd just rambosassin through, be sure to enjoy the rpg elements, I really got into character development and reading minds with the heart. I really recommend this game, it's really fun and great, good anti hero style characters, no pure good, no pure evil.",

I say this because you are a near silent protagonist that is presented with multiple open, non-linear playgrounds with which to stalk and eliminate your enemies (if you so choose) and as is so with many sandbox games, the fun comes primarily from your own mind.  Use your imagination and explore each level. There are little bits of side-story and side-quests on nearly every mission so don't be afraid to go out and put yourself into a little danger to get the full experience.  I'm on my umpteenth playthrough and it still hasn't gotten old. A whorthwhile purchase, to be sure.",

From what I understand, chaos reflects actual chaos you create, not number of deaths, ie silently killing everyone with no alarms would result in low chaos.  3] impose a restriction on yourself: total stealth, non-lethal, no abilities upgrades, etc. most are supported with achievements  4] if you like the challenge, you could turn off objective markers or start at a higher difficulty  The important question at the end of the day is whether it's fun and to that I answer: YES.",

Armed with an array of weapons and supernatural gifts bestowed upon you by the mysterious Outsider, you sulk around the grimy, plague-infested city of Dunwall as you seek revenge on the conspirators that murdered the Empress and framed you for the crime. Though the story is linear in progression, you are given the freedom to approach your missions however you see fit, capable of murdering every living soul on the map or completing the game without killing anyone at all and it is that freedom that makes the game a joy to play.  Featuring a heavily atmospheric world filled with dread and corruption, Dishonored is a great looking game with its own unique style that adds a lot of character. Levels are filled with books to read and resources to find, and you are able to achieve your objectives in multiple ways based on your own preferences and playing style. It can be difficult, but never fairs unfairly so, and it is always satisfying when you complete a mission without ever being detected. It is also refreshing that the game has no traditional boss battles, though your targets can be challenging if you go at them face to face.   The game has some weaknesses, mostly around the silent protagonist you play as, who would have benefited from having a voice to provide an emotional connection to the character. The voice acting is good and features some notable talent, but not as well utilized as it could be, and a real conversation system and some roleplay mechanics would have been welcome. There are also limited character models, so you will be running into the same faces a lot over the games running time. The game’s running time will also vary, averaging between twelve to twenty hours depending on play style, but thankfully has a lot of replay value as you try new combinations of powers and seek out new routes to achieve your missions.   The two DLC packs, Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, are also great expansions to the world, and both benefit from the dry, world-wary performance of Michael Madsen as Daud, an antagonist from the main game that you now get to play as. These missions help develop the world even more, especially the supernatural elements, and offers up new environments to explore. I totally recommend them, and anything to increase your time in Dunwall is always welcome.  ",

Stealth is rewarded in many different ways throught the game, including a MUCH better ending, less weepers (like zombies), and less plauge rats. The very few problems it has are easily overlooked by the masterful story, characters, combat, and aesthetics.There have been concerns about the length of the game and how much it costs, I can confirm that the game can be beaten comlpletly with stealth in about 6-8 hours. If you were to use purely Action orentated gameplay, you would probably finish the game faster. Since this game has two different paths you can take, a second playthrough is recommended.

This is another game that does stealth and player choice very well. It has a heavy Bioshock vibe to it, with the supernatural powers and ocean theme, but that's not a bad thing. Gameplay is fantastic. You can choose to sneak around everywhere, or you can use your sword, crossbow, gun, and all sorts of other gadgets to fight your way through the game's rather large levels. There's a real sense of verticality when you're running around Dunwall. This game has definitely taught me to look up more often, perhaps to find hidden items or an alternate route through a tough area. Level design is top-notch. Corvo's supernatural powers range from Blink - a short teleport that you start out with - to Posession, which allows you to posess rats, fish, and even people! My favourite power has to be Bend Time, which allows you to slow time when you first unlock it, but when you upgrade it to level 2 you can bring time to a complete standstill. During this period, try firing crossbow bolts at several guards, then when time starts again, watch all the bolts hit the guards at the same time! It's truly one of those satisfying game mechanics and it never gets old. I have only two complaints about Dishonored. First, it's a pretty short game - nine missions in total. Second, the PC port is pretty bad from a graphical standpoint. Muddy textures, low draw distance... They could have made more effort - perhaps an HD texture pack as DLC? It just doesn't look that great compared to other games that were released around the same time. Overall, Dishonored is a great stealth action game, and worth a playthrough or two.

Leading you to go on a journey to get revenge and get rid of the men that framed you for the murder of the empress. This game can be played without killing anyone at all, which is a real challenge.

Anyways, I really enjoyed Dishonored. Taking my time to explore was a blast. The stealth mechancs are perfect and I had a lot of fun turning each encounter into its own puzzle, trying to figure out exactly how to knock out each guard.   The DLC is also very good and will obviously expand.   This is great. Easily up there with Mass Effect, BioShock, Uncharted, Last of Us, etc, etc as a 'must play' game.  It is one of the few games I am about to replay on a harder difficulty, maybe doing things 'assassin' style to see what happens.   It has me wanting to go back to Deus Ex: Human Revolution, which I didn't finish either, and replay that.  Can't wait for a sequel.",

The sneaking, stealing, secrets and knockouts are a great homage to Thief. And then the powers and abilities that draw heavily from Deus Ex and Bioshock add an additional level to the game. Mostly them encourage lethal play (so I ignore them), but the Blink ability is the main selling point here, as it completely revolutionizes the stealth experience. Forget waiting in the shadows for minutes at end while surveying the room and taking out each guard one by one. Instead, just blink behind a guard and stab him, then blink silently back into the shadows to plan your next move. The powers here create a language of murder that allows you to mix up each situation by making the various systems work together: like possessing a guard shooting at you while slowing time and making him walk into his own bullets, or attaching a spring razor trap to a plague rat and then possessing it and scurrying into a group of enemies. The story here engages but misses on the chance to explore themes only hinted at: like power, corruption and duty, mainly because most characters are bland at worse, underdeveloped at best. The focus here seems to be on the cliched revenge plot. The game is of reasonable length, and the 2 newest DLC packs, which add some welcome difficulty and some new powers plus a new story, are worthy purchases.",

While the plot was fairly predictable, the fantastic setting and outstanding voice acting made the whole game feel truly big-budget. Similarly, the open-world approach to the missions and the imaginative range of special powers made for an atmospheric blend of tension and sudden violence that was great fun from start to finish.  One criticism that I've seen levelled at Dishonored is that it's too short. I find that a bit strange - maybe if you blitzed through it with crossbows blazing you could finish pretty quickly, but that would be missing the point. I played with a mostly-stealth approach, but without going for the extreme pacifist achievements and I clocked around 24 hours over a week - collecting most items without being a completionist. I guess I'm lucky that I can afford to buy new games fairly regularly - but I would much rather play a short, perfectly formed, game than something padded out just to make it longer (looking at you, Skyrim) And 24 hours isn't exactly short.  So if you're worried about value for money, don't be. If you're not a fan of stealth games, neither am I - Dishonored is definitely worth playing, especially at the discounted prices you can generally get now!

            "review_text": "Very highly recommended. If you liked games such as Deus Ex, The Witcher, Thief, or Dark Messiah, and you haven't played this game, you are making a mistake. If you've never played any of those games, this is a good place to start.   Dishonored is a first-person game in which you play an imperial bodyguard named Corvo. Your job is to do what the Empress tells you to do.   Then she gets stabbed to death, right in front of you. Spoiler: she didn't tell you to do that. So now you're in trouble. Nice work, Corvo!   From there you have to redeem yourself while protecting those you care about and deciding the fates of your enemies. Note that I said, 'deciding.' This is very important; you don't have to murder everyone! I, however, played Corvo as a man with a folding blade and anger management issues. Dishonored is very good at giving you excellent reasons to shank everyone you meet. Some of them are jerks, some of them are trying to kill you, and some of them are directly in your way. However, the game is quite up-front about letting you know that violence begets violence. And darkness in general.   And darkness is something the city of Dunwall doesn't really need right now. Their beloved empress has been brutally murdered (again, nice work.) They're also under the effects of a fairly mysterious plague that is killing people by the trainfull (literally.) The government's response to all this has been a draconian crackdown on freedom, which may or may not be some sort of analogue to what is happening in America, but I chose to ignore that statement, if indeed it is intended as one. Harder to handwave is your own effect on the city; your decisions directly affect the state of the streets, as you either pile up the body count, resulting in increased rat and plague activity, or you angelically save everyone, which probably does something else less horrible.   I chose to risk it, by which I mean I went into each mission with the best of intentions, but sooner or later I'd run out of sleeping darts, or I wouldn't be able to figure out how to sneak past a checkpoint, or a guard would cough, and the result would always be frenzied stabbing. But the point I'm trying to make here is that you can choose to do otherwise, and it matters! People's lives are changed, their reactions are different, and the game as well as the ending are affected by your choices.   I personally turned the sweetest most innocent person in the whole game into a Sith Lord. Perhaps you can do better.",

Want to get to that alternate path so you can avoid fights altogether? Blink up to the roof. That one ability really makes the game so much less frustrating than most other stealth games. If you're trying to go for a murderless run be aware that the rat swarm ability, dropping bodies from too high up and dropping people into water or other hazards will count as you killing them, things that I didn't realise at first.",

            "review_text": "Dishonored is a stealth-action game based in a Steampunk-like world. (things run off of whale oil, so I guess that makes it Whale-oil punk?). You play as a former bodyguard turned assassin known as Corvo. He works with a group of men and women loyal to the late empress who Corvo was framed for killing.  Dishonored plays like a blend of Deus Ex and Hitman. These are to game series I really like, so Dishonored is certainly my type of game. This games biggest strength is the amount of choice the player is given. You can go on a throat-liberation marathon, teleport and avoid guards, or just go crazy and murder everything. Granted that last option is very hard to pull off, but if you do make a mistake, you can turn it around without loading again.   Corvo can equip a crossbow, pistol, grenades, mines and a sword. These weapons aren't really all that unique feeling, which is somewhat disappointing. Despite this, the combat feels good, considering it's quite simple. The sword feels like it has impact, and blocking is a very useful tool.   What makes Dishonored stand out is Corvo's magical powers. To begin with, he can teleport, but he can also posses rats, see through walls, and summon a swarm of rats to eat enemies, just to name a few. You acquire these powers through runes, which are often hidden in out of the way places. You also get Bone Charms, which provide mild boosts in your abilites, but to be honest, I didn't really notice the effects much.   Movement itself feels smooth, which is important considering you're suppose to be a nibble assassin. If you can't climb up it, you can probably teleport to it. The insta-kill animations only take about a second, if that, which is great, as I don't need to watch five seconds of some dude getting torn apart. Just a simple knife to the throat.   Sneaking is fine for the most part. My only complaint is that in one level I played I was hiding in a bush but enemies could still see me. This bush covered me head to toe. Apart from that, the stealth was fine.   The story is pretty solid. I have a few minor issues with the story, but nothing went full retard. My only real complaint is that it felt a bit rushed, and honestly, the game could have been placed a little slower. This would have given the game a little more length, and that would have been nice. Granted, their are multiple endings, and choices/playstyles to add to replay value. This is also one of the few games that made me change my approach for moral reasons. For example during an early mission, I was given the option of branding a target a heretic, over killing him. This made me change my approach from a simple murder, to a chaotic attempt to get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ branded.  The atmosphere is great. I really enjoyed the world. My only complaint is that I wanted to see more of Dunwall, and the surrounding area. Even though I had to lower the settings a little to make sure it'd run smooth, the art style still carried through.   This game really does what it sets out to do. Tell an engaging story in a desperate world with fun, open ended gameplay. I really hope the sequel lives up to this game. I give Dishonored a 9/10.",

WHile there weren't really many 'magic spells' to use, the ones that existed were great fun.

The game's visuals were appealing, a mix of Victorian and future-tech that was not quite steampunk, with a touch of the cartoonish look from 'Team Fortress 2'. The game's design was surprisingly impressive and had to be experienced in order to be fully appreciated.  The freedom with which players could go about completing missions as Corvo was very enjoyable. Whether it be with aggression (high chaos) or with stealth (low chaos), there were always multiple ways to traverse the varied environments to one's liking. (But, anyone who had played 'Dishonored' would likely agree the teleport power, 'Blink', was the BEST aspect of the gameplay.) This individualized experience made completion of each mission very satisfying.  Two of the game's DLCs featured Daud, leader of a group of assassins in the main game, in his own side story during the events of 'Dishonored'. Daud's story was less engaging and consequential than Corvo's, but allowed for a few impressive set pieces and slight variations to his supernatural powers to make the DLCs somewhat worthwhile to play. Enemy AI seemed to have had a bit of tweaking for the DLCs, making the transition from the main game a bit jarring.",

My main complaint is with the Chaos system, which is pretty much just the same hackneyed morality system that infests so many games. Despite killing scores of people being so fun and easy, doing so will give you an ending that's very dark in tone, while blinking around to knock people out and deposit them in out-of-the-way places becomes samey, dull, and a bit silly.

I won't spoil a drop of this story. It's too good. Honestly, it is a driving story with the constant fear of being discovered by one of the many different kinds of enemies that keep this game playable more than a single go around. I'd gladly play this game again, and intend to purchase it to do so.  A few things to note:  -Some of the voice acting is... Well... Bad. The character almost seems disconnected from the world when they speak in certain segments. This isn't a singular character, and honestly isn't such a major issue as to make the game unplayable. -Non-lethal routes, though entirely possible (I killed a total of two people my second time through.), aren't as well set as the lethal routes. You're given mines, grenades, guns, crossbow bolts, and a few special ways to kill people, but limited ways to do so without so. Recommendation to anyone who can alter the path of future games like this, try to offer more upgradeable ideas for the non-lethal side as well. -If there is a body, it will eventually be found. If you don't want to raise alarms, remove the bodies. Simple as that. Non-lethal: If it's hidden, hide it better.  Aside from that, the game is a fantastic stealth shooter that allows the player to do quite a bit of customization and the likes.

So i found it in Dishonored. Stealth, Action,blood,Gore,RPG,graphics, gameplay, story,acting, setting......and the list goes on. It is like a 'all in one' game where i am concerned, it is a excellent example of what a stealth action should be developed as.  One small problem i found is the is that the main character didnt get much of an ingaging role in the plot or otherwise great story,but the friends and foes makes up for that, the exploration, weapons, non linear gamplay and combat is what got me into this one.

It has a unique style and theme, almost steam-punk-assassin-victorian amalgamation, a simple, clear-cut story with a few plot twists inside, and a host of characters and interactions that make it worth to play. What REALLY sets this apart from other FPS stealth games are the power combinations and manipulations you can have in this game. With a good variety of abilities, and good timing, you can make impossible tasks seem like child's play. In some instances, you can manipulate time, and other people, to make a man shoot himself. Combine that with the great variety of weapons available in the game, you can create a 'rat bomb'. This little trick involved summoning a few rats, freezing time, attaching a mine to one of them, taking over the mine-strapped rat, and then moving the rat into a group of enemies. Then, kaboom.   However, sometimes too much of a good thing can kill a game. This was almost the case with Dishonored, as it implemented a morality engine that forced players who wanted a good ending to find other ways to take out targets without killing people or being seen. While this puts great emphasis on an otherwise great stealth engine, it now limits the player from using all the cool weapons and abilities he's been given, for fear of not getting the ending he wants. This, in my mind, kills the whole mood of a game about an ASSASSIN. I feel like Dishonored tried to implement something unique, but took good ideas from others games as well (I.E Deus Ex: HR, Thief) and sadly killed alot of the amazing things about it.  TL;DR: Buy this game on sale, play it a couple times, gaze at it in your library for a long time until you forget all about the game.  6.5/10",

The first person stealth mixed in with a few magic powers, weapons and gore is really a good mixture. The graphics are amazing for the style of the game (Similar to bioshock series). The game has really good stealth mechanics but where it lacks is the 'free to choose between stealth or guns blazing' is a bit off. The game leads you to play stealthy which is a very positive aspect but if you do try to go guns blazing you're sure to die fast. I played through the game without using the hand gun or the bolts to the crossbow (I used the sleeping bolts and the knife mostly). I feel as if the magic powers you recieve are a bit over powered for my liking but that is just my opinion. The characters to me feel like they are a copy and paste with a few different voices but this is just my opinion i've seen better character design and voice acting. The story is really good so that is a plus. All in all this really is a good game and you should really consider playing it! 7/10 Just for the almost repetitive level design and character design.",

The latter proves to be more fun, and the World of Dunwall is GORGEOUS. Playing this game on its highest graphical settings is a must if you can. I slides past realism and goes for a cartoonish aesthetic that only helps make it feel more real.  Since it's an older title now (or rather, not brand new), you can probably get it for cheap during a sale, and if you're into single-player campaign games, then this is a must.

I only got that atmostphere when I put the difficulty level at very hard (the hardest difficulty setting). Other wise you can hack and slash your way through the game easily enough. Also I don't know if they meant to do this or not but your teleport abilities is way overpowered in my opinion. Didn't take much effort to beat some of the levels simply by teleporting around all the way to the end. Especially so for the last level. Good points I might add is that if you like the freedom to make your own choices, for the most part this game does especially well in that and you can see the consequences for said choices making a fun game when you can see you can have an affect on the world in the game. I do like how the game rewards you for choosing stealthier options so I feel a tad bit better when I don't hack and slash my way through. SPOILER FROM HERE. At the end at the Lighthouse I manage to skip all the guards and the 'wall of lights' by just ascending through the level with teleport which I leveled up all the way and agility for the jump.

Story: 8/10 You are corvo attano, a quiet royal guard to the empress of dunwall, a city under the effects of a plague during the course of the story. Around the first 5 minutes the queen dies her daughter is kidnapped, and you are blamed by some real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. Ok so in all seriousness this story has been done before i'm sure. However, what made it stand out is how you impact it. Are you killing everything you see? Well then your going to have a much darker ending. Maybe you didnt kill a SINGLE person? Well in that case good news for the future of dunwall.  Gameplay: 10/10/10/10/10 This is why I replay the game. In my opinion your story can be the ♥♥♥♥, your setting can be perfect, and your graphics, can match reality, but the most important part is the gameplay. Screw it up and all burn the game. How is it here? AMAZING. See in dishonored you have powers, and you can do stuff that is so creative your enemies wont see it coming. A good example? I saw some guy shoot a bullet, STOP TIME, Possess someone and put them in front of the bullet killing them. Also, do you not want to kill anyone. CONGRATS you can just knock them out or shoot them with a sleeping dart. This is what will keep bringing you back  Thats all im gonna say my final recommendation is to buy the ♥♥♥♥ out of this.

Only real problems are that there are some invisible walls and floors that will literally leave you floating in the air over buildings. Also, I wish there was a New Game+ mode for more fun high chaos runs.  I really like the fact that leveling up powers is simply done by collecting runes. It doesn't matter if you're merciful or psychotic during the game, your power is only dictated by how willing you are to hunt around for runes and bone charms.   9/10  Presentation:   This artstyle can be hit or miss. I like it personally, but sometimes I think of Half Life when I look at character models. I've never even played Half Life.   The levels are pretty damn cool though.   7/10   Story:   Unfortunately this story only really happens because the main character is a victim of circumstance. Making him a silent protagonist just kind of ruined the chance of me taking anything the story threw at me seriously.    I wasn't even mad or shocked when your loyalist companions poison you and leave you for dead. I was just left being completely apathetic.    The only real character that can make some kind of emotional connection is Emily, the one you're supposed to protect so she ends up being empress someday. Moments with her do feel kind of nice and cute, but they're short lived.   There's a moral choice system in this game, and it's not a bad idea (it actually makes a bit of sense) but with Corvo being completely mute, the only real consequences happen to the robotic companions you meet throughout the entire game. I really could not give a damn about them. Live, die, I don't care. I just wanna kill people in creative ways.  5/10  Fun:  9/10  Play this game for the gameplay, it really is that awesome.

There are numerous paths you can take to complete each level; you can choose to be stealthy, trying to sneak through without being noticed, or you can just rush in and kill everything in sight. The choices you make have effects on later parts of the game, too.  It's probably best to choose early on whether you want to be stealthy or violent (similar to how you can choose to be good or evil in, say, Infamous) as this choice will influence the upgrades and equipment you purchase as the game progresses. Also, if you choose to be stealthy, it will definitely help to make use of the quick save (F5) and load (F9) keys :)  You can definitely feel some thematic influence from Half-Life, especially in the later parts of the game. It's much less linear than Half-Life, though, and there are plenty of side quests you can choose to complete. I'd say these are worth completing, too, since a lot of the characters you encounter make appearances in later missions.  Overall, a very good game that made me want to play through it again using different techniques. Beautiful art style too.",

But then you keep playing and start understanding the genius behind the game. By mid-game, a singular level is more interesting and unqiue then most full games. It's just a fantastic game. It's art.

Dishonored kept me entertained for so long, and I know I'm just one of many people out there that understand where I'm coming from.  I'll stop talking about how delightful Dishonored is, and I'll tell you about the game itself: Dishonored is a Stealth game where you're on a mission. (No Spoilers beyond, don't worry) (One more thing though: If you don't want to know the storyline, move on please) Basically you play as the Empress's Guard, and as you're returning from a journey to learn more about the rat plague currently going on, the Empress is killed.  I will let you figure out the rest. As for the DLCs, I find the stories just as interesting. The DLCs are of course, shorter, but still have stories. But they mainly focus on missions, not storylines. The 2 DLCs I own are: The Knife of Dunwall &amp; The Brigmore Witches. Both of these DLCs are excellent, and if you buy Dishonored and enjoy the game, I would recommend buying these 2 DLCs as well.  That's really all I have to say about the game. As I mentioned before, I love Dishonored, and I have no complaints about the game. I know there are flaws in the game, but I was very impressed with the game, and had fun playing it the entire time. I won't mention any flaws in the game because I simply can't think of any at the moment.  On further note: I would recommend this game to anyone interested in buying it.

Even though another 2 DLC is kind a pointless but i highly suggest you play both The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches it's just really great DLC i think the story , characters in The Knife of Dunwall is actually a lot more interesting than the main story , The Brigmore Witches is okay still worth it but not as great as Knife of Dunwall for sure.  Still Dishonored is a really great game and it's getting sequel already !! So if you like what you see just buy it and you won't regret it.",

            "review_text": "I've played this game quite extensively on the PS3, and finally decided to pick it up on Steam too after one of the latest sales. so I could re-live it and play it more easily. I LOVE this game. It's a great game, the world has been so extensively thought out and built, you can tell they've put a lot of effort into it. The story is somewhat typical, but still good: you play as Corvo, who was once the Lord Protector for Empress Jessamine Kaldwin, until she was killed by the infamous assassin Daud before your very eyes and you were framed for her murder and the kidnap of her daughter, Emily. Knowing your innocence, and helped by those who believe your innocence too, you seek to find Emily to restore her to the throne, as well as seek revenge on those who framed you. There's a host of cool powers and weapons in the game, and it's worth playing with them all, but personally I think it's the stealthy approach where I think the game truly shines. The characters are great and well rounded. Dunwall itself is based around a steampunk-y England, but there's a definite dark and gritty tone to it. The main campaign can be played quite quickly if you want to, but there's so much replayability about it.   The DLC is great too. I haven't played much of the City Trials but they offer a new challenge for veterans of the game. But the real prize are the Knife of Dunwall and Brigmore Witches DLCs. Here you play as Daud (the assassin who killed the Empress), and learn his story. His story is so much more gripping and interesting than Corvo's, and he has so much depth to him, as he struggles with the guilt of what he's done, and faces his own enemies. Daud has his own powers to use, and visits completely new locations, and so it's definitley worth playing. Maybe I like a bit of a redemption story, or an anti-hero type character, but I really loved Daud's story and the DLC missions to the main game.  Overall, a great game, one I thoroughly recommend.",

Can be played guns blazing or as a stealth game (which I preferred and recommend as it makes the game a lot more challenging) with a simple and predictable yet well-crafted story and great believable characters. One of the best things about the game is that it manages to create a believable world that feels lived-in and real thanks to the gorgeous environments, presence of moving, talking NPCs that react to your actions as well as its rich lore that you learn about by listening to the announcements from the loudspeakers or by picking up and reading the many sources of information scattered throughout the game. The kick-♥♥♥ abilities that you get are also an absolute blast to use and experiment with and make this game unlike any other of its kind. Best.movement.aka.teleportation.ability EVER! You can also play the entire game without killing anyone and the manner in which you deal with the stage 'bosses' without resorting to lethal force is always different, creative and highly entertaining: bad people seriously get their comeuppance here xD. Add in a simple yet effective upgrade system and stage collectibles that serve to further enhance your abilities and you can stretch this into several hours of gametime. I also highly recommend the 2 story DLCs as they add more depth to the story and are a lot of fun as you get to learn more about Daud the leader of the Assassins and his road to redemption (or not). And if you've paid attention to the lore in the game you'll finally be able to encounter the Witches of Brigmore and they are badass. Also, the manner in which you can deal with their leader without resorting to lethal force and without being seen at the end of the second dlc is downright f***ing cool.  9.5/10",

You can turn your character into a demigod of meat-grinding-spinning-executions pretty easily; the most basic skill in the game is pretty overpowered. The REAL fun in Dishonored is never resorting to that- this is a game that makes stealth challenging but richly rewarding. You can literally go through the game and not kill a single person and watch as fate and karma catch up to the worst of the worst, or take their fate into your own hands and play the roll of the truly witty assassin and take only those you feel need to meet their end by your own hand.  Gameplay aside, the storytelling and environment in this game is immersive and both excessively beautiful and grim. Make sure you use the Heart often- its whispers are more than interesting.

The point is this game is awesome, it has great gameplay, wich is the most likeable thing about it. It gives you the freedom of choosing how you go through a certain part of the campaign, wich are either going in full guns blazing and murdering everyone, or just takin your time to go around enemies while trying to avoid detection. The only thing not so appealing about the game is the story, wich i dont really care about, and there are only a few likeable characters like the boatman samuel who is just a likeable and simple character, while the others are quite forgettable. And i don´t quite understand why the main character Corvo never talks for the hole game, and this is something i´ve never quite liked in video-games with a few exceptions like skyrim, where it doesnt really matter if your character speaks or not, because you don´t really care. But nonetheless this is still a great game and should be one that every stealth game enthusiastic should definitely play. It definitely earns a 8/10.",

That isn't just it, you have many ways to get to your goal like taking to the rooftops, going undewr ground, or take everyone out. - The people who voiced granny rags and the outsider are great. They in my opinion are the best acted in the game. - Through out the game I didn't come across anybugs. But, the game crashed on me 2 times.

Dishonored is one such game.  Don't get me wrong. this is a good game. Gameplay is smooth, PC controls works, graphics is cool, storyline is sorta serviceable. But it somehow lacks a spark somewhere. I'm not sure what it was myself. This is supposed to be some kinda stealth game, but frankly, you could just blast your way through the whole thing Duke Nukem(TM) style pretty easily. The lack of a 3rd-person view angle makes stealth gameplay frustrating. After the 10th time getting caught hidding in a place where i swear the guard can't possibly see me, i pray to 3DRealms, transform into Duke Nukem(TM) and never look back.  The game world frankly is also kinda weird. It's a sorta steampunk + mystical world where industrial machinery coincides with the mystical fantasy of the occult. The world is a bunch of island empires and you're in one of the biggest ruled by a monarchy. Whaling is the main industry and whale oil powers all the machinery. But there is the mystical 'Outsider' who is foreign by all accounts and deals with magic. Yup, magic.  Also, all the talk about empires and power struggle seems a bit odd when throughout the game, all you saw were discrepit buildings, soldiers or some zombie-ish commoners struck by the plague. Yup, they got zombie-ish thingy threw into the pot too :-|  While the game is executed very well, the content is a letdown. The world is shallow and frankly, a frankenstein of steampunk, magic, shooter, swordplay, stealth and zombies. They try to 'pad' the content background by having books/notes on the backstory where you can pick up and read and i read every one of them that i came across. Still, it felt like the content is really thin and you don't know much more about the game world after the first 2 levels. Neverthless, i actually quite enjoyed the game and did a run through but i wont be replaying this since the world/content just doesn't feel 'right'.  Still, i would recommend this game solely because it's a well executed game and also an enjoyable experience. Just don't expect too much depth from the game world.",

Now, I'm not really a huge fan of games like System Shock 2 where your character is really puny and helpless, but Dishonored is another extreme: you're virtually indestructible (once you reach a certain point in the game). I did not try to up the difficulty, but I doubt it would've made a huge difference; a Level II Windblast or a Bend Time/Bloothrirsty massacre would still probably wipe enemies with ease. Also, the High chaos ending is really, REALLY dark and depressing, so think carefully about what playing style you choose.  Another thing I've noticed about this game, which is a huge bonus for me, is that it has this 'Half-Life' vibe to it; I dont' know why, but it just reminds me of Half-Life 2 for some reason and even the original Half-Life. Perhaps it is the pacing: there's a really good balance between story, action and exploration.  All in all, a great game, one of those games sure to be on 'must-play' lists in the future. If I had to sum it up in one sentence, it would be 'BioShock and Half-Life 2 had a steampunk baby whose occasional nanny was Dark Messiah of Might and Magic'.",

            "review_text": "Unique, well-realized world, solid action/stealth with light RPG elements and an intriguing story. Solid purchase.   Dishonored is a first-person action/stealth RPG created by Bethesda Softworks. The player assumes the role of Corvo, personal bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. Corvo embarks on a long quest for revenge that takes the form of missions that revolve around assassinating various targets and gathering intel to help Corvo in his quest.  The atmosphere is awesome - the setting is pretty distinctly 18th century, but with some neat futuristic technology and magic sprinkled in. It's tough to talk about the story without giving anything away, but I was immediately sucked in to it, and I had a difficult time putting it down.  There is a nice variety to the missions, and they never felt boring or repetitive. The quests offer multiple means of achieving objectives that merit several replays (there is an option to replay individual missions). In addition to main quest objectives, there are always interesting sidequests and jobs to pursue.   Corvo has a variety of gadgets to aid him in his quest. Grenades, traps, a pistol, a small sword/dagger, and a crossbow with incendiary and sleep-inducing darts. Corvo also has powers that allow him to see through walls, teleport, slow time, and more. Corvo's gear and powers can be upgraded through in-game currency and through runes and bonecharms that you gather in each mission.   Generally, the player is offered lethal and non-lethal options while playing through missions. A lethal playstyle will lead to increased enemy presence and the addition of other obstacles to future missions; to be honest, it feels as if the player is penalized for a bloody playthrough, and stealth is flat out more entertaining and challenging.   Overall, I highly recommend Dishonored, and I rate it a must-play. The world is interesting, and the story engaging. The gameplay feels tight, and the content of the missions is wonderful.     ",

Rats and the plague spread more if you kill more. Yet...there are only two ways to knock out an enemy. 1 being in VERY limited supply and expensive to procure, the other being inefficient if you're near any shape or form of a group of enemies.  So you get two choices really. Be a murderer with a hard game, or be a cheater. Kill everything in sight or keep on reloading those save files/ running away like a madman.  Add that with the fact that outside the detail of the outfits the actual models of the characters are rather poor unless they are extremely important, and even then it's lackluster in comparison to the beauty of the environment.  All in all, it was a great idea, but the execution wasn't the best. If there were more ways to take out enemy non-lethally...instead of 'Here's you sword, gun, explosives, arrows, and everything you need to kill people horribly!' this could actually work its way really high up as a game, but as it is I cannot say I recommend this. In where it does things well there are things that it does horribly too in turn, and those horribly done things glare in contrast to the good.

I played the game and all the daud DLCs on a high chaos and a low chaos and it felt so much different playing on high chaos and low chaos. It had a great sorry line, the campain and DLCs, and the gameplay was amazing. i would recomend buying it with game of the year edition, because the DLCs are both really awesome. the game does not need an alien ware pc to play it, and i can know because i have a potato pc.

The stealth aspect of the game is amazing, IMHO. Playing it slow and careful, taking your time, planning several moves ahead, using the environment to avoid not just guards, but everyone and occasionally neck-stabing a deserving villain, it all makes this game one of the best I've ever played. The combat part of the game seems to be at the same level, but I won't guarantee for it, as I tend to either avoid the combat or flee from it.

I would say the base game is enough, although GOTY version is not much dearer so go with that, but wait for a good sale, not on full price. It has a very distinct art style, and I fell it really captures the human heart of a pandemic situation.   Dishonoured is not a long game. You will not play it throughg over and over again for the story. Do you know then, how I managed to put over 100 hours into this? I will tell you why and you might do as well:  Dishonoured has environments that are extremely rich with detail. There are these characters, and a mostly forgetable tale about them, but what really captivated me was the City of Dunwall, and it's story. It is the story of a town that was prosperous and powerful, then a terrible illness befell it, and it is engrossing how that affected the man on the street, which you see quite often.  In the very first level, I remember well there are two putrid corpses of a man and a woman hugging, one of them wrote a note about how they had to hide here and they have run out of medicine and they just want to spend their last moments together. In another level you find a house with letters wtitten by a woman who lost first her husband, then her daughters too, before she finally fell. These stories of the lives of regular people is the single most engrossing thing for me in Dishonoured, and why I explored every level thoroughly, strived to find every rune, every secret, pick up every coin, etc. When I played the game, I really felt for all those poor people, and it made me think about those who suffer similarly in our worl, for instance, from ebola, or smallpox in it's day.

So many small things vary based on your actions that you may not even notice, but when you do it even further immerses you into the game and it's story.  I personally love the art style. I feel like it really goes well with the era in the game (1800s)    I can't say enough good things about this game. The replay value is through the roof compared to most other games. If you are thinking about buying Dishonored, do it! I highly doubt you will regret it.  Anyway... 'Blow off, choffer!' ",

The combat is very basic, yet enjoyable, and you can make it more fun with the aid of your powers. Speaking of which, powers aren't just for combat, either. You can apply them in stealth and navigation, along with finding new and unique ways of reaching your targets.   And the way you play the game does affect the way the city changes around you. If you're a murderous psychopath, plague and the weepers (zombies) that come with it becomes much more rampant. This can cause problems for you in some circumstances.  If you're a sneaky peacekeeper, the problems you face along the way will be less dire, and the City Watch will not be as zealous.

Depending on which path you chose, it will effect the story in a profound way. The powers you are able to use are pretty cool, but some are much better then others. Blink, Dark Vision, and Slow Time were the only ones I used, and even if you plan to kill everyone, the more agressive powers are not all that useful.

But it's way too easy and short if you actually use any of these tools and abilities, and even trying to be mostly stealthy only increases the playtime by a few hours.  For the price (now around $20 prior to any sales), I still have to recommend it, as there's a lot of creativity in killing stuff. But the campaign is way too short unless you are a 100% stealther and 100% completionist. Really, I found probably 70% or more of the runes, goodies, etc., and did some side quest stuff, and even tried to rely on stealth as much as possible, and it still took just 7 or 8 hours to get through.  Overall, it's got a good story, and playing stealthy or playing brutally affects the ending, and it's always a fun playground for figuring out new ways to kill stuff. Missions themselves are also very well done.   But the length is very short, and without any DLC there's very little in terms of just going around killing stuff for fun. And certain abilities are just absolutely OP... teleport, for one, is super powerful, as I personally had 2 missions (of maybe a total of 12) where I found ways to simply teleport through or around the hardest sections. And sleeping darts are more scarce than you'd think, so, again, you would rather rely on some (admittedly cool) traps and gadgets, but this only makes the experience shorter.  Very good game, and now at decent price for it's length. At initial release it was too expensive for the play-time you probably would get out of it beating it while trying to find everything, but definitely worth it now.  EDIT: My total play-time of something like 14 hours actually includes beating it *twice*. It's that short. I played it mostly stealthily for about 8 hours while trying to find stuff and really get into side objectives, and it took maybe 4 more hours to beat it while playing it like it was Doom 2. Last two hours were spent re-playing parts just to mess around killing stuff.",

The story arcs are tasteful and well thought out, and the fact that Corvo is a silent protagonist only adds to the experience, as you are allowed to have your own individual perspective regarding the events that are occurring in-game without a scripted voice telling you what to think, like so many other games do. The gameplay is phenomenal, and the graphics are impressive while retaining a very distinct style, which truly sets the tone along with the magnificent soundtrack that highlights everything you do perfectly.   The emphasis on the Chaos system makes for an interesting experience while Corvo tries desperately to clear his name and remove the usurpers from the throne, while his parallel, Daud, the legendary assassin who slew the Empress, has to deal with his own brand of betrayal while simultaneously having to worry about The Royal Protector coming for him. Every character in this game is dynamic, and each one reacts to the level of Chaos in the world differently. The Victorian-esque steampunk setting is quite unique, and you can change that setting to be very dark or relatively peaceful, (compared to what it could be) and everything in between. On top of all that, the DLCs rival the main storyline, coming with new mechanics and a very different perspective on the world. Overall I recommend this game far more than almost any other, and if you have not bought this game this is an excellent time to do so. I very much look forward to the second installment in this beloved world of ours, and you should too.",

As I said above, every mission can be completed differently, every target killed with a different weapon in a different spot. The magic and the combat in this game fuse beautifully. Wanna teleport behind people and slit their throat? You can do it! Wanna slow time and kill everyone? You can do it! Though, I find the blocking a bit shoddy. Personally, I'm tired of games telling you what to do, this game doesn't!! You don't have to kill anyone, you can kill everyone, whatever you want. Use your environment to your advantage! Play the game however you want to play it. In my opinion the only dlc worth buying is the Knife of Dunwall and the Brigmore Witches. Those two dlc are like games of their own. The Void Walker Arsenal and the Dunwall City Trials. They give you extra money and some new weapons and well, trials. Personally I don't recommend the Void Walker but you might enjoy the Dunwall City Trials. I just don't like 'trials'. Definitely #3 on my top ten favorite games 9/10",

With your powers, you're laughably more powerful than any regular enemy you will run into, though the game can be completed without using them. My advice for a regular playthrough is to own your mistakes and only use autosave. It makes the game's Chaos dynamic much more meaningful, too. In Dishonored, your mistakes don't often end with your death and a reload, but with a room full of your dead enemies.",

Granted the developers of Payday are a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, but anyway this is not a Payday 2 review. Some of this is owed to the art style, which is amazing and really compliments the dystopian atmosphere of a plagued Dunwall. Everything feels smooth and instantly puts a smile on your face. Even off sale it's a god damned bargain because it's so damn cheap. Hell, I'd say buy it if it was £40 still.

With the exception of the very first gameplay section, all of the missions may be approached in different ways. You will likely do things the hard way on your first playthrough (unless you just shoot everyone), but there are many other routes and approaches to most of your targets, which keeps things interesting on later playthroughs.  Cons: 1) The game is quite short. You will likely finish your first playthrough of the game in well under 20 hours, which is a bit disappointing... That said, the game has a degree of replayability due to its level design and the moderate diversity of spooky magical abilities. 2) The story is mediocre in most places, and the characters aren't very interesting. It isn't a big deal since the gameplay is strong enough to compensate. 3) The morality system is dumb. It feels like someone pitched it early in development as part of a marketing gimmick, but nobody seems to have found a good way of implementing it. Basically, the plague gets worse if you kill a bunch of people. There doesn't seem to have been much thought put into this though. You are either a thoughtful and disciplined individual who puts aside their own personal troubles for the good of others, or you are a vengeful monster that only wishes to see the world die in agony. There is very little grey area inbetween. It is quite annoying and more than a little bit silly.  TL;DR : The gameplay is fun. The 'morality' system is absurdly black-and-white, and should arguably never have been included. Buy it if you want a fun stealth game, but don't expect much from the story.    ",

That is no exception to the target.Your playing style have great effect on ending.   Dishonored is a splendid game but I think if there is the new game+ mode, it become more fantastic.That is way, to acquire or upgrade supernatural powers, you need Rune.I enjoyed exploring stages and finding Rune in the first playing, but I felt slightly laziness finding them after the new game+.You can also collect Bone Charms which impart permanent boosts and buffs to your character, but the grate part of them are not effective, I think.  DLC There are 4 DLC. Dunwall City Trials, The Knife of Dunwall, The Bridgmore Witches and Void Walker Arsenal. Dunwall City Trials is like challenging mode which is appointed the task and equipments. The Knife of Dunwall and The Bridgmore Witches are spin-off stories features more of legendary assassin who play important roll in the main story. They help you with understanding the story more deep. Void Walker Arsenal is pack which gain immediate access to four content bundles previously available only through pre-ordering Dishonored.  To start DLC, you select 'MISSIONS' in the menu and sellect 'DLC' next to 'CAMPAIGN'. This is a littele perplexed in a system side...  Something extra To skip logos which you can't skip, you have to edit ini file.

Go break in the front door or sneak in as a rat, a fish, or a human. You could even disable the traps or rig and use them to your advantage. Not only that, but each of your actions have a consequence. Such as by murdering everyone, the upcoming levels will have a tighther security, more rats, and more weepers. The fate and treatment of the NPCs will also be affected depending on the overall actions that you've performed. There are also 3 different possible endings that will also be based on your actions, which I think makes up for its short game length as it adds a bit of a replay value to it.",

I must say, this game is amazing; I've waited so long for this game to be on sale, and now I'm really tempted to buy Dishonored 2.   This game has a rich storyline, with a lot of plot twists and leave you wanting more. Of course, a game this good is bound to have tons of bugs etc. One of them being a glitch where I think I attempted the mission wrongly, and was not given the subsequent missions even though I've completed it and had to restart just so that I could continue the game; and there are certain parts where it is really glitchy, like for example I tried to toss the body, and it glitched at the fence instead of being tossed over the fence. However, this game provide a lot of action (basically you can kill anyone) and puzzles to solve. The decision you make (be it killing someone, doing a favor for them etc) will actually affect how the game will be played (but the ending will be the same). I didn't know about the hagfish &amp; weepers until they attacked me, which should have been hinted to us, as well as the River Krusts which I never knew was a thing until I heard it's creepy noises and then it started firing at me.   Overall, a really good game; something similar to Thief, and a must have for anyone who is interested or have played Assasins' Creed before. I'm rating it 8/10",

If you're the type of person that gets offended by opinions different from your own, DO NOT READ OR RATE MY REVIEW]    I've heard some persons have some difficulty getting into the game, and I do agree with them as someone who also didn't like the game at first. It's clear that this game IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. I don't believe it's just one thing of it, but varying things I've noticed in the game. Before I get into the good, let's sit down and talk about what could be turning some people off about the game:     Story is  okay . As far as first impressions go, the story doesn't get you hooked either. At most, it's quite good, but there's only like ONE moment that will surprise you in the storyline.    Stealth kills are so...boringly unsatisfying. First time I prefered not killing an enemy in a stealth game.    The only character I can see people liking is Emily   (and she's only present like 7% of the game)  . The rest of the characters don't really bring much life to the game at all.    Also a silent/mute protagonist? Doesn't help the game's appeal when it could have.    The game punishes you for killing enemies by comprimising its already generic story.     For a game that wants you to NOT kill anyone, there's only TWO ways to do so: Stealth choke or Sleep dart.    Potential Spoiler:    End boss was underwhelming? Probably because I spared their life too.       Potential Spoiler:    Good ending isn't really that good. Just feels like a normal ending to me. Kinda disappointing if that was your goal for not killing anyone.      Now you're probably asking: 'It sounds like you didn't like the game. Why rate it positive then?'. That's because I found  MY own way  to enjoy it. If you find yourself not liking the game, then at least try switching your style of play like I did. Usually when I play a stealth game, I always aim for killing my opponents steathily, however, this time I enjoyed rendering enemy AI unconscious and aiming for nothing less than the 'Ghost' achievement. Will this suit you? Maybe, maybe not, but what's important is that you try.  Now there is really only ONE positive of this game:  The gameplay . To some that may not be enough, but for others, it's enough to justify experiening the game. As far as stealth goes, it's pretty good.      Satisfying to get the 'Undetected' achievement and the 'Didn't kill anyone' achievement.     Rendering enemies unconscious other than killing them, is a better experience to me.     Different ways to kill enemies.     The powers are AWESOME. More stealth games should have them. Once you get the hang of using them, they're very useful.    It's also fun to abandon going stealth and just rip apart enemies like a mad lunatic. Once you get used to it, you get better at using the game's weaponry, as playing the game for the first time can wield a challenge.   Rating: 7 out of 10.",

If you're the type of person that gets offended by opinions different from your own, DO NOT READ OR RATE MY REVIEW]    I've heard some persons have some difficulty getting into the game, and I do agree with them as someone who also didn't like the game at first. It's clear that this game IS NOT FOR EVERYONE. I don't believe it's just one thing of it, but varying things I've noticed in the game. Before I get into the good, let's sit down and talk about what could be turning some people off about the game:     Story is  okay . As far as first impressions go, the story doesn't get you hooked either. At most, it's quite good, but there's only like ONE moment that will surprise you in the storyline.    Stealth kills are so...boringly unsatisfying. First time I prefered not killing an enemy in a stealth game.    The only character I can see people liking is Emily   (and she's only present like 7% of the game)  . The rest of the characters don't really bring much life to the game at all.    Also a silent/mute protagonist? Doesn't help the game's appeal when it could have.    The game punishes you for killing enemies by comprimising its already generic story.

In Dishonored you can make your way through the streets and sewers of the city of Dunwall as you sneak or slaughter your way through patroling foes and plagued citizens to accomplish your missions and explore a city on the verge of ruin. To help you on your way you have a number of otherworldly powers allowing you to teleport, manipulate time, summon rats, and other useful abilities.  You also have an arsenal of equipment to assist in your endevors, state of the art weapons, high tech gadgets, and a telescopic mask that will allow you to choose weather to fight your way through your enemies, or take a more subtle appoach and mearly knock them out.  Choice takes a major part of this game as you must not only choose your appoach through the missions and their multiple paths, but you must also choose how to deal with those who wronged you and caused your dishonor.  All in all Dishonored is a great game that will captivate stealth fans as well as offer something even for those who prefer a more direct route, as you explore a wonderful world on the brink of collapse.",

        {
            "review_text": "Edit: Note* After playing the DLC, The Game of the Year Edition is well worth it  There is one thing that sets Dishonored above the rest: level design.  Throughout the 9 levels, there are tons of ways to play: you can sneak through the sewers and come up through the kitchens, get on the roof and jump through an open window, posess a rat and sneak through a tunnel, find a guard house and rewire the traps, or even charge in with a sword and pistol, flinging wind and rats at any who oppose you. If you take your time to look, there is always another way to approach a mission, with both slaughtering everything in your path and leaving no trace of your presence being equally viable options, with the game even encouraging two playthroughs to accomodate both playstyles.   Aside from level design, the implementation of a simple ability, Blink, is fantastic. You have it by default after the prologue sections, and it just completely opens up the gameplay and adding a lot of depth to the level design. You can go up, over, and around obstacles quickly and efficiently and, if ever spotted, can get out of dodge with a little bit of foresight to backtrack quickly.  Another strong aspect to the game is the atmosphere. Dishonored takes place in the city of Dunwall, the heart of an empire in a steampunk era running off of whale oil. A rat plague has engulfed the city, killing or displacing most of the population. The entire game has a sense of dread, with homes abandoned, corpses everywhere, and the City Watch enforcing martial law to 'keep the peace' (read: slaughter anybody infected with the plague and blackmail everybody else to line their pockets). There is no hope, yet you are fighting for a better future by toppling the corrupt government that stole the throne -- just kidding, you're just trying to get revenge for your friends with benefits Empress getting murdered and clearing your name so her (and possibly your) daugher can take the throne.  It's the little things throughout the game that really make the game come to life. The letters to loved ones, the street gangs trying to scrape together a living, locked chests and hidden compartments that send you scrambling to find little scraps of information in order to pop open a secret area. The potions that heal your health and mana are competing elixirs designed to fight the plague. Multiple factions exist, trying to survive in the rat-infested city.  Collectibles in Dishonored are better overall than most games, as they actually have a function. Runes allow you to unlock more abilities granted by the Outsider, Bone Charms add small little boosts to make life a little easier, and gold and ammo are everywhere, allowing you to purchase a crapload of upgrades that are overall pretty terrible (almost every monetary upgrade improves your fighting capabilities, which means that stealth be damned).  The graphics are extremely dated, feeling like a mid to late 2000s game. It definitely feels like it was made with consoles in mind, including controls. Speaking of, controls work fantastically for both keyboard + mouse as well as controller.  Overall, Dishonored is one of my favorite games from this decade and spurred my interest in stealth-first action games. I plowed through to a platinum on the playstation, and it's even better a second time on PC. I give it a 9.5/10, and highly recommend it for both the casual and hardcore stealth players, whether you want to assassinate everybody in the city or make the entire government disappear without a trace.",

            "review_text": "I avoided Dishonored when it was being advertised, years ago, because by one look at it I knew it would be 'Half Life 2 meets Bioshock'. The art by Victor Antonov was very clearly 'butthurt because they didn't use my ideas in HL2 so I'll take it over here'.  I was not off the mark there, in any way. In fact, many lines of dialog, all the vehiclular designs, color schemes, and whole battles, arenas, events, and visual constructions of levels are blatantly Half Life 2. (let's see, 'you were in the wrong place at the right time', the entire 'strider battle' with tall boys, 'nova prospekt', 'captive in the metal transport cage/battle at the top of a tower', every single combine-i mean sokolov- vehicle's appearance, the blue metal structure walls blocking off streets.... I could go on?) Throw in the visually steampunk Bioshock aspects, and add in the Plasmid use... Toss a pile of Thief stealth aspects, and you have Dishonored.  Oh yeah, I was kind of expecting Corvo to have a voice actor? I guess they wised up in 2 and gave him one. Yet Another Mute Protagonist. While Corvo can be pretty amazing, when you look at him he's absolutely the blankest of blank slates, and has zero personality aside from the clear adoration of Emily. All the rest of the characters in the game - and specifically the DLC with Daud - have far more attachment and engagement with what's actually going on. I find it hard to believe that Corvo himself isn't dumb as a bag of hammers, given that he, as the Lord Protector and lover of Jessamine... *went out for months* while the clearly devious Spymaster was busy engineering the Empress' demise. I mean, how about 'no, sir, this is my post and it would be completely insane to leave it' comes to mind. With the flimsiness of that plot however, it also seems like the rest of the city is exactly as vapid as the protagonist.  There is so much potential in this game's world for story telling. So much, completely wasted with this game. However all that said:  It was an enjoyable game, fun to play, and fun to play again. While the quirky specifics of the achievements are indeed pretty weird (i'm going through a second time trying for clean hands, but not ghost and definitely not flesh and steel) I like exploration and definitely like the stealth aspects. I only wish that they'd allowed for more of a non-lethal Corvo! Playing the DLC as Daud at least you get the ability to increase the number of sleep darts you can use, but Corvo cannot?! Well, at least that still plays well enough with being able to use takedowns.   Even though visually the game is shamelessly HL2+Bioshock, it's at least internally consistent. However the art itself is garbage, undetailed, might as well be low-rez in many cases because they don't stand up to close inspection. If I look at it as 'they're all paintings', that's not bad at all, because the character design and lighting supports that pretty decently.  The clunky UI is clunky, the radial menu difficult to use at best, and the lack of hotkeys for certain things was dismaying.   I think my biggest beef with it is that you just don't get one straightforward story even though there's a shockingly linear progression through the game. There are hints in all the books and notes you find that there's something much more deep and entertaining, but *none* of it surfaces, ever.   The DLC and challenge levels are actually far more engaging than the main game, though the level design of Daud's story is far less clever and much more limited than the main game. I wish that the level design had kept up in terms of exploration and complexity, but that the main game had the personality of Daud's dlc.  Anyway - I do recommend the game, but don't expect anything other than highly derived locations and visuals, and if you've played either Bioshock or Half Life 2 understand that this game WAS designed by the same guy doing HL2's work... and it showed.",

The missions are different from eachother and are good at teaching you new mechanics. The only downside of the game is that there are only 7 missions in the whole game. I'm glad that you can go back into a mission and change what you do. That gives the game a lot of replay value. There are some DLC's that add new missions and abilities to the game which also can make the game more interesting. Overall this is an amazing game and ost likely my favorite of all time just because of the awesome mechanics. *This game is amazing*",

Still recommend it for decent gameplay and really good story tho. During sale or not, this game still worths every cent. Dont hesitate to buy it.

The DLC adds a new perspective on the story and a few interesting new skills. The graphics hold up pretty well and I don't think I experienced a single crash or glitch.   Strongly recommend grabbing the DLC-included edition of this game when it's on sale.",

The whole concept of the game and the world it is set in is fascinating. The Weepers are terrifying and yet I pitied them at the same time. I wish there could be a sequel but I also like that there won’t be (so far at least). Lastly, this game is NOT for the faint of heart. It can and will turn your stomach.",

Some things that stick out despite all my enjoyment: The voice acting is distractingly bad, which is surprising considering how much polish the rest of the presentation has. There are also elements that either seem half baked (quest giving NPCs found around the city) and some balance issues (the rat summoning ability is way too overpowered, killing people with this doesn't alert other enemies which makes no sense). These are all minor complaints, though, sneaking around has rarely felt this good.",
