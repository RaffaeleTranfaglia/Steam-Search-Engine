            "review_text": "Yeah, I know. This game is published by the company that brought us two unplayable products before. All non-Russian reviews are negative. Even the two positive reviews hardly count as such - one is sarcastic (the reviewer seems to have refunded the game), the other one is from a guy who played for just 40 minutes. The almighty Jim Sterling has publicly called this game 'sh*t' and 'utter garbage'. So it must be complete trash, right? Right?  You know what? I approached this game with an open mind, and I really enjoyed it. Yes, it's pretty rough around the edges. But it also provides several deliciously surreal environments to explore. I liked how the artists used scale, transparency, and reflection to create interesting surroundings. The atmospheric sound-work was outright excellent in my opinion. The story, even though it was told in a very clumsy way, with text in broken English that sometimes wasn't even fully visible, touched interesting subjects. The puzzles gave me a sense of progression and accomplishment, but were also easy enough to not detract from the experience. (At two points I had to look up non-obvious solutions in the forum.)  That said, I fully understand why people might not like this game. If you expect a polished experience, then a game where you can easily wander off the map and fall endlessly into the void will hardly meet that expectation. If you expect a story with the philosophical depth and skillful execution of 'The Talos Principle', then this game's broken language and buggy text display will feel jarring. If you expect challenging or diverse puzzles, then this game may feel bland - most puzzles are simply key collection quests, or mazes to navigate.  But if you're the kind of player who likes being taken on strange journeys, give Invisible Mind a chance. If it sounds interesting to you to walk through a valley where transparent human silhouettes desperately slam their hands against non-existent walls, watched over by two massive skulls and a cross above a fire, then have a go at it. I found the journey enjoyable and inspiring, despite the flaws.  (Disclosure: Key was bought with a bundle. No prior contact to the developer.)  (Side note: I'm not sure if an army of fans will downvote this review if I mention this, but I really think that a certain video game critic could treat quirky games with more respect, instead of seeing them just as fodder for sarcastic comments. I'm absolutely fine with critics not liking or even panning games, and I totally agree that Invisible Mind is not a game that lends itself to be showered in praise. But, seriously - if a critic clearly shows no inclination at all to even get in the mood for an atmospheric game, and talks half the time about his unfinished business with the No Man's Sky community before then offhandedly dismissing the game he's (not actually) playing as 'garbage', then I think we're overstepping a line. Am I asking for too much when I say that a critic should, perhaps, actually give a game a modicum of attention before panning it?)",
