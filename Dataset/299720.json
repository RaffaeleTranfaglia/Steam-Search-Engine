            "review_text": "I've been playing TD games since the original StarCraft, and Terrorhedron is refreshingly unique amongst the genre. This is a fun and interesting take on Tower Defense which can be very challenging.  There are a variety of towers which you might expect in TD, such as single-target lasers, splashing cannons, and slow towers to name a few. Where it gets complicated is the limited numbers and orientations of mounting points along the map. This is when you turn to your 4-sided tetrahedrons and 6-sided cube pieces in order to expand your defensible area, which also allows you to place towers in otherwise-blind spots for coverage.  Upon the last enemy's death (or when it reaches the gate and you lose lives) the round pauses for building phase. Use this time to experiment with angles to maximize coverage of your turrets. Any pieces you place during this time can be sold for their full cost, but once the building phase ends, all of these pieces will only be worth ~50% from then on.  If you like TD and want a fresh, fun, and challenging new game to play, buy Terrorhedron.",

Some have a straightforward use such as the laser towers; just shoot at the enemies. Some have a tactical use and must be placed in a certain area to maximize it's effectiveness, such as the EMP tower.  The currency system awards you appropriate currency for killing enemies. You don't get under payed and you don't get over payed, so the difficulty is balanced. You must manage your money well however, or else you won't have the appropriate funds to construct much needed towers.   The one thing I need to mention is that the waves' difficulties are unbalanced. Some waves I handle no problem and I'm at around 80 lives. I build even more towers than before, thinking I'm ahead of the game, and then I end up losing. I don't really understand.  Also I play multiplayer on this game quite a bit and would like to see an option to give your partner some money. Like a 'loan $100' button or something like that.  I got the game for $0.32 and can say that it is well worth the cost. I would buy it again for full price if I needed to! I give this game a solid 9.5/10",

The online co-op works well and is a pleasant addition, every game is more fun with friends.  Worth it at full price and a total steal if gotten in a bundle.

Multiplayer is a PITA. They force you to type the IP address of the host every single time you lose. Copy Paste does not work and there is no obvious .ini or .cfg to edit the default.

This is an interesting change to the tower defense formula and adds a new layer of strategy. The other main difference Terrorhedron adds is the ability to build connector blocks to tower locations, meaning you can turn a single tower slot into a defensive megastructure.  The music is great and really adds to the minimalist tech feel that the game provides. The enemies are all colored shapes which change depending on how many hits they can take. Towers are unlocked throughout play at a reasonable pace, I never really felt like I was grinding for a new tower or being given too many options too quickly. You can also upgrade your towers which generally provides them with a new ability rather than just a stat boost, which is great.  I can't think of any real problems with this game. I have been having a ton of fun with Terrorhedron and if you are a fan of tower defense games I think you would too.",

            "review_text": "..... That dots above this text shows how speechless I am about this game. The game's screenshots is so unconvincing and looks like nothing more but another dirt cheap indie game (I bought it when it was around ~US$0.17 on my rates), but it REALLY has more than meets the eye.  Gameplay wise, there's nothing new about this game. It's basically place towers to shoot 3D shapes down before they reach their destination. You'll start with a single, unupgradeable tower and some money to build a few of them. You'll have to progress just with that. As you shoot more of these shapes you'll gain XP, unlocking new towers and upgrade levels for the towers, just like Bloons (in fact, the whole game feels like Bloons).  What makes this game unique and nauseating at the same time is that the map is 3D taken to literal levels. Enemies can move through planes just as long as there's road on the cube's sides and so your tower placements (as long as there's deployment zone). You'll need imagination and decent visual interpretation to make your perfect defense, as deployment zone's arcs will affect wheter the turrets can shoot them or not (the turrets can only shoot in half-ball area). You can also build turret platforms to build more towers (of course), greatly enhancing numbers of creation possibilities (feel free to use the screenshots as an example or maybe, spark some ideas).  For the sounds, the SFX's are rather generic (especially the firing sounds) but the music sounds rather kickass, and somehow fits the futuristic feel of the game (even though it isn't, I mean why there's such structure in the space in the first place?).  Visually, there's possibly nothing to say. It's just cubes, pyramids, balls, simplistic to say the least. The amount of health the object have is based on it's color. That's it, nothing else. Even the options only give you options for toggling fullscreen and audio volumes.  Worth one buck? Well if you like old school TDs with 3D twist, then this game is really worth it. Just beware, the learning curve is not for the faint of heart.  Pros: - Co-op (if you have friends to play with) - Old school TD experience with massive design possibilities. - Techno music.  Cons: - Confusing and nauseating map layouts (takes a while to get used to).",
