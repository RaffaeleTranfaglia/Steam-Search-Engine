This game is a lot of fun, and saved my sanity sometimes in multiplayer, however there are far too many issues that can occur. Lots of spots where I've gotten stuck and literally unable to proceed with no way of getting out. So after a couple play throughs I have been extremely upset with the bugs and glitches with multiplayer and certain aspects of the game that make you restart.  Additionally, the spells are glitchy and don't always target where you want them to.   If these issues were addressed and fixed, I would be completely happy, but for now I am unable to continue my saves and am upset with the game",

Being both an oldschool gamer and an avid Dark Souls and the likes fan, EP0CH appeased both my gamer sides equally. The game deliver every little bit it promises and definitely it is one of those games that I would recommend for everyone I know to play. I can heartfully certify that this was one of - if not the best - indie games I have played.",

            "review_text": "I'll start off by saying I can't stand dark souls, I think dark souls is the worst game ever made and as I started playing this game, it became very obvious the description isn't lying and it really is similar to dark souls.  I hated every minute of the tutorial because of this but then came the boss fight, as I roll and attack the boss, I actually felt fun, unlike the smaller easy monsters in the tutorial, the boss required some skill. Of course it wasn't too hard, it was definitely doable.   This very same experience was horrid for me in dark souls but somehow ended up fun in this pixel drawn world. If you like dark souls, it's for you, if you like zelda, it's also for you. There's something about 2D games that makes things better, perhaps we're too used to 3D by now that going backwards is entertaining.  Nevertheless this game accomplishes things other 2D games aren't even attempting, clever movement, the weapons are drawn with full 360 rotation unlike the common 4 direction frames. I only just started but it seems the basics are well done.  The developer seems pretty enthusiastic and already patched every bug mentioned, gotta love indie developers that care. ",

During beta testing I was completely inspired by the versatility in playstyle options. The attention to detail is stunning for an indie game. Nick has truly gone above and beyond to develop a masterpiece. The Zelda-like wonder combined with the challenge of dark souls blend together to offer hours of gameplay.",
