By this I mean you can send your entire army into an unwinnable battle just to see what is in he enemy base, then go back in time and cancel the attack. That, by the way, is called  Echo Scouting  and is one of the most basic achronal strategies in the game.",

Starts off slow, and you will be too frustrated at the game to figure out if it picks up. It seems like a time travel game would have amazing amounts of freedom to beat each level however you would like. But not this game. You must click exactly how it (very vaguely) tells you. Don't exactly understand how you were supposed to click? Then you can wander aimlessly for hours, because you aren't going to beat the level until you move your troops exactly where it told you. The second level is best described by the constant beeping (a bug that constantly checks to see if your units are in the right spot, and beeps if they are not), and slow wandering of your troops around the map. Also included are two unavoidable deaths so you can learn the game mechanics, one painfully slow click at a time. I was really excited about this game, but now I am just frustrated that I own it.",

The game is tedious, overly complicated, looks awful and does not give you anywhere near enough satisfaction for your actions because half the time it seems so random.",
