Beautiful, clean graphics, relaxing piano music, and 56 entertaining puzzles - yup, this is one of the best games to just chill out and test your problem solving skills. I'll be honest I'm not usually a puzzle gamer, but the creators made an irresistable atmosphere to play in. It made me feel like sneaking out at night as a child and playing in a field or jungle gym. Despite my occasional outbursts of 'Gaaaaaaaaaaahh!', I'm looking forward to beating all the levels and getting a perfect 3/3!",
