Usually I would start a review with some sort of story hook, an attempt to use my own words to evoke the kind of atmosphere you can expect from the full experience, something to show you at a glance whether it could really speak to you or whether you would not connect with it at all. In the case of  Narcissu 1st &amp; 2nd , I feel that no matter how long I try, I will not be able to top the original summary by  Insani  (quoted above and throughout this review), the fan translation group that first brought  Narcissu  to English-speaking audiences. Instead I will just quote their writing where appropriate and dive straight into the facts myself.   Narcissu  and its sequel  Narcissu Side 2nd  are rather famous kinetic novels (meaning they have no branching story or player choices) with a strong legacy in the VN community. They are known for their use of minimalist visuals, mostly showing  backgrounds with no character sprites  or even  just a gray void , with only very few  character CGs  inbetween. The soundtrack relies heavily on  piano pieces , but also makes use of  other instruments  in some places, and features two  title tracks  with Japanese vocals. The engine shows its age in some aspects and does not have a fullscreen mode for example, but apart from that it has everything you'd expect, including save states and a soundtrack menu. As a reader, you have the choice between two different English translations or the original Japanese script, and you can opt to listen to the Japanese voice acting if you so choose.   Imagine what it would be like to have your entire life -- your friends, your family, your interests, your loves, your hatreds, your future -- all taken away from you in a single instant. Imagine a hard, lumpy bed, a noise-filled ward, the sharp sting of needles entering your flesh at all hours of the day, the indignity of being woken up just as you are about to fall asleep for incessant vital statistics measurements, the doctors whose names you don't know (but that's okay, because they don't remember your name, either; they just remember you as 'the non-small cell lung carcinoma in room 6'), and your own name, your very own name, that you have just about forgotten.    Then you might have some clue as to what it is like to be dying in a hospital.   It would be off the mark to describe  Narcissu  as an 'emotional rollercoaster' since the concept would imply lots of ups and downs, but even though  Narcissu  ends on a bittersweet note of resolution, it is pretty much devoid of 'up' moments. VN connoisseurs might note that this places it in the  utsuge  genre, everyone else seeking more stories like it now has a keyword to search by.  The story is about an unnamed young man who  falls terminally ill . After all venues of hope are exhausted, he is moved to the hospice ward of the local hospital, where he meets a girl of about his age who conveys to him the unwritten rules of the inhabitants of the  7th floor , of those who are going to die. The two begin a series of awkward non-interactions that culminate in their decision to reject the dichotomy of dying either in the hospital or at home, which kicks off the main arc of the story.  The way that  Narcissu  hones in on its themes with every fiber of its being is both its strongest asset and biggest liability. Everything about it, from the background visuals to the character interactions, is teeming with the drabness that you would expect from a story about young people in palliative care, which is not at all a melodramatic 'woe is me' caricature of exaggerated sadness and self-pity, but a cold collage of loss and hopelessness rooted in questions that no human should have to ask themselves, such as: What does it even mean to be alive if there can be nothing to look forward to? Both main characters' actions and non-actions need to be viewed through this lens to have any hope of being understood.  In that sense,  Narcissu  as a piece of literature is more demanding of your sense of empathy than many other games and visual novels: It could easily be misunderstood as a story trying to show 'normal' people what it is like to be terminally ill by taking their hands and walking them through the experience, but in actuality it's closer to a slice-of-life story about people who are terminally ill, that asks you to make the necessary mental steps towards those people on your own if you wish to understand them. In short: This story isn't written for you, it's written for its main characters.  One example that I can give without veering too far into story spoilers is Setsumi's attitude towards the protagonist. She initially comes across as standoffish and rude, and there's the tacit expectation of a pivotal moment where she finally starts to open up so the 'proper' story can start, but that moment never comes. Where a less patient or empathetic reader might leave the story unsatisfied, we can instead take the opportunity to examine Setsumi's behavior with her medical situation in mind, and ponder the way that human relationships develop. Most of us go through life every day making small passing connections to people, but only once in a while do we meet someone we like enough to allow ourselves to be vulnerable around them (which takes courage) in hopes of forging a lasting connection that we can depend on in the future. But what, then, if there quite literally  is  no future? Suddenly there is no point in opening up to anyone new. Why bother taking the risk of potentially getting hurt if we will not live to see the reward?  The novel doesn't spell these details out to you, it asks you to understand the characters on the basis of their actions. Questions like why having a goal is suddenly such a big deal to the protagonist are left up to interpretation. The combination of strong characterization (which if you've seen my previous VN reviews you already know I am crazy for) and partially unapproachable writing is not for everyone, especially not if you are looking for light entertainment, but there is a lot of substance to it for people willing to make the effort.  In summary,  Narcissu  is a great visual novel that can be genuinely rewarding to read, but is ill-suited for those of us with short attention spans.   This is a story of so many things.    But most of all ...    This is the story    of a girl whose heart was standing still    and a boy whose breath was being stolen away,    both of whom die. ",

This VN has surpassed my expectations, especially for it being a free download (a rarity on Steam and for a VN). Some people mentioned that it's really dated, and I do agree, but it's not a bad thing. The simple graphics and artwork make you appreciate the story more, and leaves everything more to your imagination. The soundrack so far has been amazing, and ties very well with the very melancholy/gloomy mood that 1st is set in. I have a feeling that the majority of my gameplay time will be just listening to the OST. The story was drawn out, but I think that was for the better as well. It allowed you time to connect and sympathize with Setsumi and the Protagonist. I knew what to expect with the ending, as it's typical with Japanese stories and VNs in particular, but man, that ending hit me hard. Tears weren't really shed, but the feels did hit me once I realized what happened.   A very thought-provoking story, and I highly recommend it. Even if you aren't into the VNs, each story takes only a few hours to complete (Narcissu 1st can be completed in one sitting). Definitely worth the download. Read Narcissu 1st first voiced with English subs if you want to get the best experience.  10/10 would get the feels again.",

It's mostly novel-like in that it shows you the environment with music, but very little of the actual characters and they're not as young as you'd think. - 1 and 2 can be played independantly. If a tragic ending or Visual novel-styles don't turn you off, it's a really great game and overall very good quality for a free game.  - Once you've finished you can also just listen to the soundtrack for free and run it in the background like a CD and check out extras such as commentary on the game and development. - Easy achievements for those who want them.",

(though I have none of them)  What I want to write:  Actually I played Narcissu's app a while ago, approximately 2 years from now on an android phone. It was a warm May afternoon, and I got a 2 hours off after the swimming class and before after-class curriculum. I had only a mobile phone, no homework, no friends around, and nothing to do but waiting for the curriculum. So I found myself so bored that I have to seek something interesting - except playing games on my phone that I had cracked for several times. I checked google play store, with the keyword that I've forgotten, and my focus was caught by an app with a cover of white background and a smiling girl. Its name was “水仙” (shuixian, means narcissus in Chinese). I downloaded it, thinking it was some kind of Life simulation bishojo game, which was a perfect way of wasting time. That's how I found Narcissu, the Chinese translated version.   However, it's Narcissu. The result of playing this 'Life simulation bishojo game' was that I had totally forgotten what was around me for the next 2 hours, because all my focus was on this novel. No matter how loud guys were when the class was over, no matter how warm the sunshine was, what I could only feel was a kind of regretting, for something that I could not express at that time. That's Narcissu. I did not cry, but my heart was somehow hollowed at the time I finished it. That is Narcissu.",

            "review_text": "So I've played through the 1st game and probably halfway through the 2nd. So I felt like I should state my opinion. First I love the game (err visual novel) some dont like to just read but I do so this linear style suites me. Second the atmosphere of hoplessness you can really see and when people say a lot of it is pretty bland in hontsty they were pribably going for that. The whole process of sitting infront of a boring TV waiting for enevitable death fits that. Third to me its one of those games that for me didnt have a lot of emotion every time but when it was needed it really hit me like a train now I wasent curling up in a ball crying like when watching clannad but it really had very strong emotion behind it if you are a very imaginatinve reader and the texts becomes almost like a movie in your head. All and all I rate it a strong 8.5/10 for the first game, the second game as of now is a vast improvement of visuals and even including a sort of music video makes the overal package 9.5/10 (I wont give a full rating for the 2nd game since I havent completed it fully)",

There is a heavy use of piano in the soundtracks which adds more emotion to the story. We can clearly see that the writer didn't want it to be a tear-jerker, it made me cry, made me smile and at some place it made me think about my own life and my regrets.  I recommend the voiced reading with auto-play since Setsumi's voice acting is really great. Though I can't say the same for Himeko. Her voice acting, also written in the Narcissu 2nd side notes, is faulty in some places but if you can overlook it, it's pretty much great, too. I also advice you to read all the notes after finishing the story.",

Unlike most visual novels this one doesn't have the characters speak to you, and appear in the picture, it usually merely shows a picture of the current location the characters are at, but despite that it's more enough to let you visualize, probably because the story itself is good enough to pull you in. And also the music is really good. It fits the moods and settings perfectly.  I've played visual novels I had to actually pay for before that were disappointing both story wise and lenght wise. This one is free, and is at least around 4 hours worth of reading and the story is actually really good. Emotional, yes. But in a beautiful and inspiring way. I wouldn't have minded to have to actually have paid for this visual novel, it delivers a lot more than some you have to pay for do.",

Imagine lying on a hospital bed, with your friends and family slowly but surely moving further and further away from you until the day you become truly alone. What will you do then? What will you make of a life when you cannot help but to die, and even while dying you cannot help but to live? Narcissu answers those questions while teaching you about the meaning and value of life and death itself,   'This is the story of a girl whose heart was standing still and a boy whose breath was being stolen away, both of whom die.'  Just because it is certain that you will die, it does not mean it is certain that you cannot live. Being able to break the so-called fate of having your resting place be on 7F or at home and being able to be truly alive even as your life is slowly being taken away.  Taking all of the clichéd expectations I had of this marvelous experience and going into the story with a naive mindset, I was blown away by the amount of feeling and depth that went into this wonderful creation. It really struck to me that even in a situation where one could only await death, these characters were still able to continue being able to smile.   I will not go deeper into this review for the sake of having to spoil more of this bittersweet and overwhelmingly blissful experience.  10/10",

It had some nice images too, though this isn't really the sort of game you'd download for graphics. I like the soundtrack and it fits the story well. I would have paid for the game. And will probably play again in a few months time, just in case I missed anything the first time around. I don't think it will be everyone's cup of tea as there's not a huge amount of light-relief from the heavy subject matter but if you are fine with that, it might be one for you.",

It's mostly like reading a book but you can hear some voices of narrative and most of the people speaking, which is real nice. The voice actresses did a splendid job.  Such a gem of a free game.

Very unlike other stories in general which are usually about trying to escape death or living out life despite the main character's illness. Also unlike other stories, this is  NOT  romantic and instead the chemistry between the two main characters is very cold and somewhat uninterested, at least on Setsumi's part. Another thing to remember is that this is  NOT  a visual novel, it is a kinetic novel. There are no choices and you just read on.  9/10 only real problem was that the music abrubtly stops at scene transitions instead of fading out. The music is really good though and contributes immensely to the overall feeling of the story. Remember to play side 2nd first as it provides the backstory for the 1st story.  TL;DR : Depression/10 It made me cry, and It'll make you cry to. It's free, so why not try it out? also has really gud music",

The fruit are your emotions in this metaphor.  The drink is what you feel at the end of the game.   The game's storyline is truely amazing, although it's not a happy story. It's hard to explain but the feeling I was left with after completing both 1 and 2 was almost sad, although I felt something a little weaker than happy, but it was melancholy too. It's like a crack cocaine except it's not illegal.  The things you should know about the game before playing are that it deals with suicide and all that knowing you're going to die encompasses. It is depressing, yes, but it is also somewhat uplifting at the end.  You should play the game in the release date order, which would be Original game, Prequel, Epilouge (1st, 2nd, epi.) because it's much more impactful that way, although you CAN read them in chronological order, (2nd, 1st, epi.)
