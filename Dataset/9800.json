The graphics of the game are a bit outdated, and the AI isn't the best, but the storyline and the rather difficult gameplay make up for it. I'd definitely reccomend this game if you like stealth games. However, the game is extremely difficult, so be prepared to spend a long time planning how to solve a level.",

            "review_text": "In Soviet Russia, Man-Hit you! This is basically WWII Hitman with GLORIOUS MOTHER RUSSIA as your employer. Plot is irrelevant since it's more than likely the kind of WWII 'intrigue' story you've heard, seen, and had forced down your throat umpteen times. But really you'll be hard pressed to find a bigger bang for your buck on Steam. The levels are very large and give you lots of options to complete missions within the parameters you need to work with. Nice to play a game that understands how experimentation and problem solving make for a good stealth game, not just being able to set up several 'silent takedowns' with click of a button.",

            "review_text": "Plays basically like Hitman with a bit of Commandos. It's pretty difficult and unpolished, so I'd just recommend it for more hardcore stealth fans who can look over a relatively steep learning curve (I didn't have much trouble, but many other people seem to) and an overall lack of polish. If you can get over that, Death to Spies is a really fun game. I especially like the overall atmosphere. My only complaints are that it's relatively short (especially Moment of Truth) and that missions don't seem to have as much replayability as in Hitman. The story is also pretty weak and confusing, but I never cared for that in Hitman either.",

            "review_text": "Very interesting and intense game at times. I personally like stealth and espionage games therefore this game fell right into my domain.  Mission design is pretty good and allows for a variety of approaches. Voice acting is a bit off in the intro scenes of each mission in terms of quality. It is not carried out throughout missions which is a good thing.  Dynamics are added that will not allow you to wear an enemy's outfit if you put a bullet through it however sometimes it glitches out and won't let you change costumes even with headshots (I tested this out since I saved before trying to obtain an officer's outfit and I was able to get it in my 4th or 5th attempt).  Physics seem good and the graphics are not bad for a game that was created in 2007. The graphics are pretty good actually.  The AI is okay as well; not dumb but not super alert as well (this may differ on your difficulty settings).  The retail price of $4.99 seems to be quite a good price for this game. I got Death to Spies: Moment of Truth but I have yet to play and possibly review that game too so I cannot say if $12.99 is worth the two games or not; if it does go on a sale the 2 game bundle may be worth it.  Rating - 8.2/10",

Great game if you have the patience - just remember to enable the map overlay which shows enemy fields of view.  There are a couple of must-have mods floating around the internet. One restores cut historical symbols, the other replaces the bad American voice acting with the original Russian, with English subtitles. Atmosphere is improved ten-fold.",

For one I had an issue about the controls where the buttons would change at random (left becomes forward, right becomes backwards, etc,) now I'm not running it game on low spec computer, I have a good gaming PC (can play The Elder Scrolls : Skyrim and Fallout 3 with ever little lag). Another issue is that I keep running into invisible walls that shouldn't be there, like the door ways of the room where the objectives are. I don't know if you guys have the same problem I do or not, but I think the game has a lot of room for improvement and bugs to fix.",

Something as simple as walking in a straight line seems to be too much for this game to handle, as a common bug forces you to walk at a 45 degree angle until the mission is reset.   Indoors is your biggest threat, you will constantly be getting stuck in place by invisable obsticles and doorways.  The original release had some pretty decent damage models, blood, and also had swastika instead of blank red armbands and banners.  This release however is the good goy censored version of the game. This was done to be released in Europe because Germany thinks the best way to move forward is to deny the past and feed false information.  Wonder who thought of that great idea...  ░░░░░░▄▄▄░▐▄▀▄▀▄▒░░▒▄▄▄▄░▄░░▌ ░░░░▄▀░▄░▐▐▄▀▄▀▒░░░▀░░░░▀░▄▀▐ ░░░█░▌░░▌░▐▐▀▄▀▒░░░▒▌██▐░░▌▄▐ ░░▐░▐░░░▐░▌▐▐░▐░░░░░░▀▀░░░░░▀▌ ░░▌░▌░░░░▌▐▄▀░▀▄▒░░░░░░░▄▀▄░░▐ ░▐▐░▌░░░░▐▐░▌▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀█▄▄▄░░░▌ ░▌░░▌▌░░░░▌░▐▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▀▄▄▀  ░▐░░▌▌░░░░▐░░▌▀▄▀▄▀█▄█▀█▀█▀  ░▌▌░▌▌░░░░░▌░▐▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄█▄█▄  ▐░░░▐▐░░░░░▐▐░▌▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▀▀▄▀█  ▌▌░░░▌▌░░░░░█▐░▌▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄▀░▄▐▄  Rated 271,504/6 million",

After the arrest of Viktor Abakumov, head of SMERSH a counterintelligence agency, Major Semion Strogov is interrogated about his missions under SMERSH.  You play as the major in 10 missions during WWII, your missions will consist of kidnaping, sabotage, assasination, rescue, and intelligence gathering. Some examples are: Infiltration in Los Alamos Lab to gather intelligence about the nuclear project of US, and the assassination of Nazi officers in an Abwehr Intelligence School in Krakow.  A very interesting game, the interface may be a llitle clunky but you will get used to it, many people say that this game is hard, so I recommend to play on easy and use guides. I think you will find this game very satisfying even if you are not a fan of stealth games.  There is no much story in the game, the goal and end of the interrogation of Strogov is not revealed in this game and I am not soure if this is concluded in the sequel. In any case the missions are interesting by themselves so I recommend this game.",

The challenge is nice without being impossible, and you can salvage a situation as quickly as you can screw it up. One weird thing about this game is that it doesn't recognize MMB as an input. not too big a deal since there aren't so many controls that you'll be all over your keyboard.",
