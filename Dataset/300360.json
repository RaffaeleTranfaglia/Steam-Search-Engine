            "review_text": "Mixed feelings about this one. The presentation is good, nice graphics and music, with tolerable voice acting and limited animation. The story is original and interesting, too.  The areas are very interactive with hot zones that simply provide amusing commentary. There are also a lot of locations with very little backtracking.  A nice little extra is that you can buy items to decorate a back yard with halloween items.  However, this game contains extremely illogical puzzles that are almost unsolveable except by trial and error. On several occasions I simply had to use the hints button to progress and even then I remained stuck until I just tried everything on everything else to proceed.  It also begins to suffer from bad translation errors near the end, possibly because playtesting didn't get as far as often? ('Watter pistol' etc.)  What's worse, is that in some of the later hidden object puzzles in this game the descriptions and the item you need to find simply do not match up. Example: I need to find a knife, but none of the knives register. Instead, I needed to click a trowel as shown by the hints button. That's why I almost wouldn't recommend this, in a HOG you cannot lie to the player like this!  Yet the game does show a lot of care in other matters and is worth a playthrough. Overall therefore a careful recommendation.",

A couple of the mini games were irritating as heck, but they are skip-able if you get too frustrated. I did enjoy the plot too. I would grade it as a 9/10 for me.",

My suggestion here though, don't go casual, pick adventure and say goodbye to 99% of the hidden object sessions in it. Only one you can't avoid, but the point of that one cleanup of an area, so it's not that bad.",

            "review_text": "I appreciate they tried to do something different. I like to give me an option to play as a hidden-object game or as a more classic adventure game. I also have to admit that the mini-games and other game mechanisms were pretty original, not copied from other games. However, the gameplay is just bad. Half of the game actions make no sense, items have no description and the boy's commentary is anything but useful. The game gives you so little information about what things are and what you are supposed to do that you're forced to constantly rely on the hint system, map clues and on using everything on everything. This is inexcusably in this genre.",

            "review_text": "I bought Evil Pumpkin because I loved the concept of a Halloween-themed Point &amp; Click; I thought it would be a perfect game to sit down and relax with.  And, while the graphics and atmosphere are charming, the gameplay is all over the place - it's a MESS.  +  If you're not interested in reading a whole dialogue on the game, here's a brief list to help you out:   -Pro's-  *Interesting story (A young boy tries to bring back Halloween in a town that has banned it for years, lots of quirky characters and creatures along the curious journey)  *Nice, charming graphics (I'd say they were fairly pretty, it was good for getting geared up for the holiday)  *'Spooky' atmosphere (Cheesy, but fun for the spirit of things)  *A fast-travel map that saves time on back-tracking, and it gives hints on which locations have active objectives  *Fun, quirky activities (Baking a mysterious chalk recipe, rolling a tire down a hill to fix a tire swing, walking in the dark with a candle, lock-picking, etc.)   -Con's-  *Frustrating, nonsensical puzzles (Following a memory pattern for a piano with fourteen keys, ringing bells by pulling nine cords, coloring candles with different bottled color powders based on the zodiac, etc.)  *Poor translation/grammar (If you're not paying attention to the dialogue, the notes in your journal won't help much)  *Slow loading time for hint box and puzzle skip option (Waiting over a minute to perform an action is too long!)  -End Result: Buy on sale.  +  The HOG aspects are traditional and relatively enjoyable, and some of the puzzles are nice, as well. But, it was agonizing and annoying having to deal with certain puzzles that were purposely designed to be 'slightly' more challenging than the rest - such as having to repeat a pattern on a piano that had fourteen keys to remember, or a bunch of candles that had to be colored with a very specific color that represents a sign from the zodiac - to serve as examples.  Also, the timer for the hint box and puzzle skip option took far too long to load; if I was genuinely stuck, I had to wait over a minute before being able to use them.  And while the map was nice to use so I could see where actions could be taken (an item to pick up, puzzle to play), and it worked as a fast-travel tool, I still found myself getting lost and confused - I used the hint box quite often while playing just to figure out where I needed to go.   Another aspect of the game is being able to collect pieces of candy that is used as money to purchase Halloween decorations to decorate the main character's backyard. However, some pieces were difficult to pick up since a few were left just next to a door or at the top of some stairs - which required some back and forth traveling just to collect them. While this was a cute trait for the game, it's not exactly rewarding, so if you do buy the game - don't get too serious about collecting every single candy.  I don't necessarily regret buying the game, but I'm really disappointed that I paid full price for a game that I find difficult, and painful, to go back to - if it's frustrating, why bother finishing it?  (But, then again, sometimes I'm too stubborn for my own good)  If you like point &amp; clicks, and Halloween, you might like Evil Pumpkin - it still was fun to sit down and play on a lazy day, until the puzzles started getting obnoxious.  But, if you hate games that are purposely made to be frustrating and unforgiving, you might think twice; otherwise, buy it on sale. It's just not worth $10 in the state that it's in, I hate to say it but it's the honest truth.  *Update: I finally did finish the game and I can't believe that it ended on a cliffhanger, that just adds insult to injury. It's a cute game, still, but...Really, this game is still rough.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game for Halloween, hoping to enjoy a nice casual puzzle game with a Halloween theme, instead I got a game that is so illogical that it was nothing more than a chore to finish. The story (if that's what you want to call it) makes no sense whatsoever, it's like the guy who wrote it was on some kind of hallucination trip. Unfortunately, what's even worse than the story are the 'puzzles' themselves. Nothing makes sense, all you do is keep clicking all over the screen, hoping that you might get lucky to find what item interacts with another item. Normally, though, you just end up waiting for the hint bar to reset, and use that instead. Even after finding the right combinations, they just don't make any sense whatsoever. I'm stubborn, so I finished the game, but I really wish I had saved myself a lot of time and aggravation, and just stopped playing after the first few minutes.",
