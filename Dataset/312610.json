            "review_text": "Incredible for a port of an arcade game, just like Metal Slug 3 in many ways. New online multi like 3 has, leaderboards, and a new feature I love of unlimited token-play. As for the game, the Metal Slug franchise is SNK's attempt at there own Contra. Super C being my favorite Contra, the Metal Slug games are a superior throwback to a genre much under-appreciated. The difficulty is a one-hit concept per life, like the Contra series, and asimilair it can be beat without a hit and features many one-hit enemies. With blistering detail in every sprite, tons of power-ups (4, and vehicles), and enemies that surprise you. The only con in the whole game is the lack of multiple paths that 3 has. If you've never noticed, these games have a story going on that is pretty hilarious, no spoliers. A great game if you are dying for a good challenge and a great game for a kid or if you drink too much like me. At least a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "I still remember playing this game years ago and this version definitely hits a lot of nostalgic nerves. It's basically a very fun, very well designed arcade shooter with steep difficulty (It's one hit kills - for you as well as a lot of enemies) Not something that may appeal to the newer generation of gamers who've grown to use to regenerating health, but to people who like old school games that reward skill this will hit all the right buttons.   The new additions on this version: -online play. -the option of unlimited continues. -mission select mode.  Drawbacks: -This is obviously a polished emulation, there can be framerate drops when there's a lot on screen. This does not affect gameplay that much however, Controls are still responsive, making slowdowns seem like matrix esque bullet time. -relatively short, unlimited continues make this more obvious.",

With fun and frantic gameplay, a good sense of humour, and an art style that, in my opinion, has held up very well since 1998, this game is incredibly fun. BUT it comes with its own little caviats, firstly, like the sense of humour that the game has, the controller support is a little quirky, and it seems to switch between two settings. The second issue is that there is some pretty serious optimisation issues causing serious slowdowns during the more frantic sections. The final issue is that the game is quite short BECAUSE it was originally an arcade game. Where the difficulty would extend the play time in the arcade, because the player can just continue on the spot, there is no punishment for death apart from a lower high score. But, overall, I do recommend this game if you like the old school shooters.",

The video quality is awesome and highly customizable, along a brand new volume control incorporated.

The game seems to have been ported pretty well, at least for single player, but the menu's are a mess, local multiplayer didn't accept 2 controllers on my PC or quite simply didn't work AT ALL. These seem to be emulation issues that could easily have been caught in any half-competent QA-division, but then again the entire menu UI and the design of its backgrounds is about as low-budget as they come. At least it's not going to take you a couple dozen quarters to get through the game like with an arcade cabinet! This game seems to be a bit of a 'best of' of the previous ones. Should you still get it? In my opinion, yes! It features redesigned levels, added weapons, enemies and Metal Slugs and a complete redesign of the order of the stages. It's not really going to be anything new, ubut in my opinion it's a great 'remix'.",
