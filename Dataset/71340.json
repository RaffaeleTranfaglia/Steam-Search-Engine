            "review_text": " HowLongToBeat.com  lists this game as taking five and a half hours to beat. Compare that to my playtime. I've gotten to the point where I can beat most levels in two or three minutes and I still keep going back to them. It's not a hugely challenging game but the experience of just running through the levels is delightful and relaxing while still demanding your attention to successfully complete. Shaving off seconds of your best time or just messing around and exploring the alternate paths makes for a fun distraction of an evening.  I generally go back and replay Sonic 3 &amp; Knuckles at least once a year. I love that game and it was by far my favourite in the franchise. I say was because Generations is now a very, very close second. Only the final boss - which, in contrast to the rest of the game, is a trainwreck - holds it back from the top spot.  The nine levels from the game are taken from previous games. Revisiting some favourites from the old games is lovely, but these levels are great by themselves apart from the nostalgia factor. Each level is split into two acts, in the first you play as 'Classic Sonic' who is styled after Sonic's sprites from the very first game. He handles very much like the Mega Drive games with only minor differences in physics (though his spin dash has been upgraded to the point of being almost hilariously powerful and fast) and really captures the old feel in a way that Sonic 4 absolutely did not.  Also unlike Sonic 4 the game makes full use of its 3D environment while still playing entirely in 2D. The background scenery is gorgeous and used in ways that would not be possible in a fully 2D game.  The 3D levels play like an amazing mix of standard 3D platformer, racing game and rhythm game. It moves much faster than the 2D sections but the forward facing camera allows you to see what's coming up ahead and react accordingly. This half of the game is much more dynamic with far more buttons on the controller being used as Sonic runs, jumps, boosts, slides, stomps, sidesteps and drifts through the levels.  The levels, both 2D and 3D, are much more designed than those of the Mega Drive games. There is less general exploration and open areas than in the old games. This is not necessarily a bad thing. The rule of high route = fast and low route = slow is enforced strongly throughout the game. Failure to hit a jump correctly does not (usually) lead straight to a bottomless pit but instead to a lower path. These diverging paths periodically meet back up for the levels set pieces which provide some spectacle for the player before allows them to try and get to the top route again. It's a clear system that gives the player a goal on replays: Learn the top paths and get them down to a tee.  There's also a variety of side missions for each level. Only 9 out of 90 need to be completed in order to beat the game, making them a nice mostly optional challenge for those who want to get a bit more out of it.  The game features 7 boss battles which are all quite varied but all, apart from the atrocious final boss, are great fun.  As for the story, there's thankfully not much of one.  There's also some nice extra level mods for this game both released and on the horizon.  I foresee myself replaying this game for a long time to come.",

This game is an absolute blast for any Sonic fan to play! The game’s premise is you and the yesteryear Sonic the Hedgehog have to rescue all their old worlds they have been to. This means every iteration in the main Sonic line is represented with a level in the game! From Chemical Plant, to City Escape, it’s nice to go back and play all these classic levels.   The gameplay is much improved over the more recent Sonic games so no worries there. The music in the game is spectacular, and I have already downloaded the soundtrack onto my computer. This is actually the second time I have played through Generations and I can assure you it is just as much fun as the first. Only thing I miss is the surprise of which classic level is next.  I recommend any Sonic fan, platforming fan, or video game fan in general to pick this up. I promise you that you will love this game as much as I do! ",

I went into Sonic Generations with an open mind, but with awareness that I might be disappointed. Thankfully I can say that all my concerns were for naught. In short, I have had an absolute blast playing Generations, far more than I expected.  The 2D levels are a great trip into nostalgia as well as providing new experiences for me. I've only played one 3D sonic game and that was about 12 years ago. Some infrequent camera issues aside caused by intense speeds, I haven't had any struggles at all with the 3D levels.   The music is fantastic, I especially love the modern Chemical Plant Zone, Crisis City and Rooftop Run tracks (the latter of which is currently stuck in my head). There is also surprisingly high amounts of customization in the skill system, something I didn't even know existed before playing. I can pick between many skills to suit my gameplay needs such as recovery abilities or a single choice of a handful of powerful skills with gameplay changing impacts.   Add in the fact that there are multiple challenges and collectibles for both zones (evenly spread across 2D and 3D) as well as each level completion giving you ranks and the option to try to get the best possible rank for each zone and challenge and you'll find that for the completionist, there is a massive amount of content to be had.   I figured I would pick the game up, do a quick run through and then never come back. Instead this has been my game of choice for the last two weeks and I still haven't reached the end (partly due to time constraints). This is a great game and lives up to the standards set by the Genesis era.",

            "review_text": "I had bought this game when it first came out in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and the whole time playing was just such a nostalgia trip. When I got to the first boss, just sitting in the white space zone listening to the music, I instantley told myself that this was the Death Egg Robot from Sonic 2, when I finally got to the cutscene showing it was in fact the Death Egg Robot, nothing but chills in my body. Just thinking back to when I used to play Sonic 2 when I was little and when I finally beat the game, just seeing that boss be back again, with the music remade and everything, I had the biggest chills ever and I will admit that it brought a tear of enjoyment to me knowing that one of the hardest bosses I ever played against as a kid was back. I throughly enjoyed this game, the nostalgia from the levels, enemies, bosses and music remakes. The first 2 bosses, first 2 mini bosses and the first 6 levels were what really hit me with the nostalgia, playing through the levels I grew up on as a kid, fighting the bosses all over again, loved this whole game. Let me also say, the boss battle against Shadow, was amazing, I played the living hell out of Sonic Adventure 2 Battle on the GameCube and getting to play on City Escape and fighting Shadow in a slight change, really made me want to go back and play SA2B again. 3 years later when I have switched over to PC gaming, it was the same enjoyment for me again. I without a doubt, hands down recommend this game. Yes some of the bosses were easier than they were in their past games (Death Egg Robot, Perfect Chaos and Metal Sonic were the easiest for me) but still, basically going back and playing through the levels that were there when playing other Sonic games, was simply amazing for me. This game was very easily one of the best games I have played, there were times it was a little frustrating (only when going for achievements) but other than that, very enjoyable and will very easily go back and play it again in the near future.   11/10 will play again  Sega, good job on the game!",

            "review_text": "Sonic Generations is the 20th anniversary game and features both the 2D and 3D gameplay from past Sonic the Hedgehog games. So, to know if this game is worth to be played, let’s get down the road and review this game.  Story: The game starts as Sonic from the past (who is known as Classic Sonic is this game) running at Green Hill Zone when a weird monster-like creature appeared. In the next part, Sonic from the present (who is known as Modern Sonic) gets a surprise birthday party from his friends. But before they could start celebrating, the monsters-thingy appeared out of nowhere and kidnaps Sonic’s friends and Sonic chases the monster to save his friends. Modern Sonic travels throughout different levels that seem to be very familiar to him, and realizes that he had visited the zones before- he traveled back to the past. There, he met someone who look like him, albeit younger. Modern Sonic teams up with his past self, Classic Sonic, to save their friends and restore color to the world.  Gameplay: This game has two gameplay style based on your character. Classic Sonic represents the games from the Sega Genesis/Mega Drive and features 2D gameplay, while Modern Sonic represents the games from the 3D games such as Sonic Adventures and features its 3D platforming gameplay. You can choose freely who to use when you’re at the hub are of the game or when selecting a level. Act 1 is Classic Sonic while Act 2 is Modern Sonic. Classic Sonic features skills that he used before from classic titles. Classic Sonic uses skills like Spin Dash and Spin Charge to boost his speed and attack enemies. You could also use the down on the analog stick while running to attack enemies. Since he is in a 2D environment, Sonic could only move left and right to proceed throughout the level. Modern Sonic features skills that are used in 3D Sonic the Hedgehog titles such as Sonic Adventures. Modern Sonic can move freely on the field and can Auto Lock-On enemies to use Homing Attack. Modern Sonic can use the X Button to Dash at enemies at full speed and it has a meter that can be replenished using Rings that are scattered throughout the level. The goal of each level is simple: Run through the 3 stages, play the challenges to get the keys to the boss then defeat the boss to unlock the next 3 stages. Challenges offers different goals to complete it such as using a certain power up, defeating a doppelganger, teaming up with another character, and many more.  Graphics: The graphics of this game looks great even though it was released back in 2011. The art style is nice, as the stages greatly resembles its appearance from the game where it came from and the characters were created neatly. The water movement from water levels also has its graphics rendered very well. The animation for wind effects, fiery explosion, facial expressions were great and well animated. The aesthetics for the buildings and smoke in Crisis City Zone, the seafloor at the Seaside Hill Zone, the skyscrapers at Speed Highway Zone are very excellent, as if you’re looking at a piece of art. My only problem is the Hub Zone. It was very bland compared to the hub zones in Sonic Adventure. Also, you can only explore the hub in a side scrolling fashion, but not in 3D open world exploration. Although maybe it’s because of the game’s story? Oh.  Music: Most Sonic games’ soundtracks were a piece of art and give us thrills and excitement throughout a level. Well, guess what? Those soundtracks are back and some of them are remixed to suit the level. Playable stages had their themes remixed and both 2D and 3D version of each stage has its own remixed theme. For example, the theme for Green Hill Zone Act 1 (Classic Stage) has the music closely resemble the Genesis version while Act 2 (Modern Stage) gives an upbeat music compare to the Act 1 version. Other tracks from other Sonic games such as Open your Heart and Live and Learn can be collected and use that soundtrack to change the stage’s music. Who wouldn’t want to run on Speed Highway with Live and Learn as the background music?  Presentation: The game is divided into three segments: Classic or Genesis era, Dreamcast era, and Modern era. They each have 3 stages from the games of their respective era, along with a boss stage and a rival stage. You will see stages such as Green Hill Zone, Chemical Plant, City Escape, and so on. These stages are created to mimic their appearances from past Sonic games and has a major overhaul for 2D and 3D gameplay. For example, the Green Hill Zone’s Act stage is based on the stage of the same name from the very first stage of Sonic the Hedgehog game on Genesis. It has its 3 act combined into 1 stage for Sonic Generations in the 2D segment and created an entirely new version of the stage for the 3D gameplay of Modern Sonic. The game also features extra stages were you can do challenges like gathering certain amount of rings or catching certain number of Chaos. It’s a great and fun alternative when you wanted to replay a stage but with more challenge. Finishing them gives you unlockables such as artwork, concept art, and music from other Sonic titles. Characters from the Sonic franchise appears and although not playable, they served as Sonic’s friend/rival on different extra stages. Characters like Knuckles and Tails help Sonic in some stage like destroying an obstacle. They also appear as rivals, like Knuckles having a race against Sonic. Despite that, the extra stages were kind of repetitive due to the challenges mostly racing, collecting certain number of rings or reach the goal before time runs out.  Overall: After suffering from broken games these past few years (*cough* Sonic 06 *cough*) Sega managed to create a great game that gives both nostalgic and new feel to gamers. Not only that they presented and combined some amazing stages, but they also managed to recreate it without losing its touch. The stages are still awesome like their past counterpart. The story feels a little weak compare to the story of Sonic Adventure and Sonic Colors, but still is great since it was simple, unlike the Sonic 06 complicated story. The game was great and I recommend this game to you all gamers out there.",

This game gives you an awesome sense of speed that makes you strive to get the best time in each level, each mission.   That's not to say that there aren't any complaints though.  1. The game is VERY short, you can easily beat this game in less than 4 hours, which is a let down for a game released in 2011. 2. Despite trying to capture the best of Sonic's best adventures in the last 20 years, the game features only 9 stages, which, I mean, there are a good 60 Sonic games out there they could've taken stages from. 3. The bosses are embarrassingly easy.  But here are the good things about the game!  1. Each level is built with much love put into them, you will easily remember back to the days of the Genesis and Dreamcast with each and every reference and easter egg. 2. The gameplay is very fun, and it's always a blast to go at the speed of sound. Modern Sonic's gameplay is a vast improvement over that of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors, providing more emphasis on 3D gameplay, rather than 2D gameplay. Classic Sonic's gameplay is a remix of the original Sonic game's playstyle, although not a perfect emulation of the classic physics. This however, doesn't affect how much fun it is to still play as Classic Sonic. 3. Fantastic graphics, and the modding community is still alive for this game, expect mods just about every month, adding new stages, new characters, and new features. It's always fun to play ported Sonic Unleashed stages on here!  I highly recommend this game to any 3D platforming lover, and Sonic fan!",

This game offers a set of nine individual levels from three eras of the Sonic franchise, ranging from the Sega Genesis to Nintendo Wii.  The gameplay is a combination of Sonic Colors and Sonic The Hedgehog (Genesis Titles). Throughout Classic Sonic's stages, you'll be doing a lot of platforming in a 2D realm, whereas Modern Sonic you'll be doing a lot of boosting. The game offers two acts with every level- one for each Sonic.  The graphics are simply superb. Playing this on the consoles doesn't do it justice. The console version runs at 30 FPS where the PC port runs at 60 FPS. The attention to detail in the levels are stunning as well. Green Hill Zone looks fantastic, and City Escape is absolutely beautiful. You can really see where San Francisco was the inspiration for that level.   However, before purchasing this title, do realize that this game can get be very heavy on your PC at times. While I never experienced problems, my friends reported having some slowdown during some areas such as Chemical Plant and Planet Whisp. Also, it's recommended that you use an Xbox 360 and/or PC controller for this game.   The game is worth the price, and it's a must have for any Sonic The Hedgehog fan. I suggest giving it a purchase and playing it now! If you're not sure, how about you click that 'Download Demo' button up there at the top and give it a try.

Sonic Generations is a monumental tribute to fans; boasting large and beautiful recreations of iconic stages from past games. (FYI, said games are Sonic the Hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog 2, Sonic &amp; Knuckles, Sonic Adventure, Sonic Adventure 2, Sonic Heroes, Sonic 2006, Sonic Unleashed, and Sonic Colors). The nostalgia will be strong with this one; but make no mistake, the actual game here is genuinely good. You alternate between both modern and classic versions of Sonic throughout the course of the game; each level featuring both a classic and modern section.  Classic Sonic plays as you might expect. Entirely 2-D platforming and the lack of a boost successfully replicate the formula that made classic Sonic the Hedgehog installments so great. Modern Sonic plunges you into EXTREMELY fast-paced mayhem that made it's debut in the form of daytime stages in Sonic: Unleashed. Quick reaction time is needed to take full advantage of numerous shortcuts that riddle the maps.  Also, the mod community has actually managed to find ways of adding new content to Sonic Generations on PC. As a matter of fact, there is a mod out now that allows you to play nearly all of the levels from Sonic Unleashed, despite the fact that it is a console exclusive.  Overall, I recommend this game with complete confidence that most will enjoy it. If you have been discouraged at all by recent attempts to reignite the gaming icon that is Sonic, you NEED to restore your faith right now by playing this game. In all honesty, the story IS slapped on and completely laughable, but it's refined gameplay and undoubtedly nostalgic nature makes Sonic Generations a crowning achievement for Sonic Team.",

I have encountered a memory leak issue which I easily fixed by launching the game directly from the steamapps folder, and also a noticable fps drop on certain parts of Chemical Plant but in all honesty those things are so small and forgivable because of how good this game is.  SEGA, please keep up the quality. I don't care if the game has to be delayed a couple more years because of it, I am willing to wait if the end product is anywhere near as good as this.",

            "review_text": "Now for me the game was a must have, being a big Sonic fan and all. That last statement will probably mean I am extremely biased but man, this game is incredibly good. Firstly the levels when you play in 2D or 3D (depending on the era) shows a really faithful remake that makes you fall in love with many levels all over again, and when you play the other act, taking your favourite 3D stages into 2D and vice versa it ends up putting a new feel to the levels which most of the time ends up being really fun to play. Admittedly I did have some issues with some later stages as sometimes the level design messed up the smooth flow the game had before, but overall the levels are incredibly good (And hey, they made Crisis city playable. Not necessarily good, but playable.) The visuals are also really great, many levels in their remade form look lovingly crafted and really do make some stages (Like Green Hill Zone and City Escape) look brand new, hell I'd buy a Sonic 1 HD remake if they made it look like generations (Well I'd probably buy it anyway but still.). Now I would recommend when you play this game that you use a controller, as a keyboard admittedly feels awkward when controlling Sonic in 3D. In 2D I didn't really have the same problems. Overall this game is easily one of the best recent Sonic games and a must have for Sonic fans. P.S. Wouldnt it be awesome if Sega added bonus DLC levels (not like the Casino Night pinball) where you get to play stages like Mystic Ruin and Ice Cap zone? Just imagine the levels remade in HD with redone music. You're welcome.",

            "review_text": "This is a ridiculously good Sonic game. After playing all of these recent Sonic games that kinda suck, I didn't really think there could be another good Sonic game. I'm really glad this game proved me wrong, because this is Sonic at his best.   You play through the game as “classic” Sonic and “new” Sonic. There are many different stages that are all based on classic sonic levels. The look and music will make you super nostalgic if you played Sonic on the Genesis back in the day. When you are classic Sonic, you go through the level just like in the original game as a 2D side scroller. The graphics are great, and the gameplay in these sections is pure classic Sonic. When you are new Sonic, you play through the game in a racing style. It almost reminds me of Sonic R on the Sega Saturn but a million times better, because Sonic R SUCKED. Anyway, these sections are just as fun. You get to run through the level as quickly as possible and you lock onto enemies more like the new sonic games. These different game modes go together better then you'd expect it is super fun.  The game is pretty short, especially if you don't care about getting a high score. There are challenges after you have beaten the classic and new Sonic levels, and most of these are fun. A couple are pretty tedious, but luckily most of these are optional. There are some pretty fun boss fights in the game too, but don't expect anything too challenging. The game is very easy to complete, but you can always go back to the levels and try and beat your score which is where the developers obviously hoped you'd spend a lot of time. If you are the kind of person that likes getting high scores and short times, then you will be obsessed with trying to beat your old scores.  The bad part about this game is the port. The port is pretty awful. There are no graphics options, and on my machine which has specs that are way higher than the recommended setting it took me a lot of time to figure out how to get this game going at a decent framerate. It took me a couple hours and a lot of google searches to get this game running at a playable framerate, and if your computer is below the recommended specs and closer to the minimum specs, you may have some issues getting this game into a playable state. I ended up having to download some 3rd party software to even get the game to run at around 30 FPS. 30 FPS is a bit low, but I don't mind it on this game. The game was actually designed to be run at 30 FPS from what I can tell, so if you can get it higher that is great but 30 works just fine.   Even though the port of this game sucks, I still would recommend this game especially if you can get it on sale. Since the game is short, it might be a really good deal to wait for the sale. I got it for 7.49 and it is definitely worth the price. If you are an old school Sonic fan, you owe it to yourself to get this game because it truly is the best sonic game to come out this decade.",

Let's just say that you need to add control editing so not only me but other people can make the controls however they want. And add the ability to change the video settings, to remove some lag.

            "review_text": "Sonic Generations is a game that in large part takes players back to the old days of Sega and some of the darker hours. It's graphics are crsip with a strong and dynamic color pallet that makes the objects wizzing past you seem just as interesting and vibrant as the blue blur. However this strong graphical integrity also gives way to a a large degree of framerate drops as the game trys to catch up with Sonic's speed. The music in the game is on point and includes remixes and reworkings of many older tracks, and if you dare you can collect all of the extra 50 of tracks from Sonic games including some you may not have even heard of (granted not all of the extra tracks are as good as the remixes). My only qualm with this is that the ost was not included in the extras room, so if you like any of the level themes the only way to hear them is in the levels themselves. As far as the story goes the game is sub-par, but it's a sonic game so the story doesn't really matter that much. Sonic and friends are having a birthday party when a giant black monster swoops out of the sky and throws them back in time. From there sonic and tails have to reunite their friends with the help of some strangers, themselves. See, pretty basic. But don't worry the gameplay will keep you going. The gameplay by the way is everything we've wanted from a sonic game to date. it's fast and the controlls are tighter then they have been. Gameplay comes in two forms, the 2.5D side scrolling classic levels, which are just like sonic 2 in their design, with no exception. These levels are fair and each one introduces some new mechanic to the 2d movement, so it stays fresh. These are of solid level design (except Crisis City which has a floating on cars section and the models of the objects your riding are really poorly positioned). Secondly the 3d modern levels exist and while their controls are refined (no mach speed setions), they still go very very very fast. So expect to only play these for five minutes tops. Honestly I think other then Planet Whisp taking too long and the inclusion of Sonic 0'6 in the set of levels (as it leaves a bad taste in the mouth of anyone who played Sonic 0'6. ugh, memories) these levels were also very solid. Sonic can be hard to control due to his speed, but that's expected.   So to sumarize: - PROS - Great visuals - Great OST - Massive collection of Nostalgia - Improved level design - Classic and modern sections  - Cons - Mediocre Story telling - Framerate drops - Crisis City Refection level (sonic 0'6) - little to no replay value   However what about completing the game? This will require you to get all S ranks on main levels, beat hard mode on every boss, and collect every red ring. You will have to do every single mission (but you don't need an S rank), and my personal hell: Beat the final boss without taking damage. And you will get nothing for this, pas completing the collection room full of artwork and music from preivious games. And while this is cool it does nothing to encourage me to play again, or get the other random achievements. And all you need to get that 'completiton bonus' is S ranks on leves (for abilities), Missions complete, and all red rungs. You don't have to do hard mode or even beat the final boss. So in short, the completion of this game is hard fought at times ( as the final boss is played as supert sonic so you have no freaking idea what taking damage actually means since YOU HAVE NO HEALTH BAR) and it's just not worth it. So FINISH IT. don't bother completing the game.  So finally my rating for this game is 7.5/10 , Finish it.",

I found it enjoyable to replay levels that I had previously beaten to try to get a better time or find all the secrets, something that will take quite a while.   Anybody who considers, or has considered themselves a Sonic fan owes it to themselves to play this game. It's a bit short, but sweet.",

It has taken the best of both worlds of the entire Sonic series and put it into probably what I consider the best game for him yet. Plus, all of the challenges to do aside from the actual runs of the levels add a bit of variety to the game, so you never have to just constantly run through the levels, knowing exactly where you're to go next. I would've hated to be on the team that picked the levels to incorperate. There are way too many good ones to just pick one from each game!",

You'll blaze past ramps, jumps, hidden emblems and entire new depths before you realize that you could have been soaring through them with a second's more dedication. Then you'll return to right your wrongs, as a quicker and more deliberate blur of cold-calculated genius on the rollercoaster setpieces created for your driven demolition. Newcomers will flail as they collide with walls, obstacles and clocks built either to deter them from this franchise forever or beat them into determined masterminds. Dedicated gamers will, on the other hand, give this thing the asskicking it deserves, and they'll earn it by triumphing over gameplay that's both thick and balanced, instead of fighting against the insurmountably broken ideologies that weave their way into most Sonic the Hedgehog games these days. Generations is definitetly one of the best Sonic games in a while, and I highly recommend playing it.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

            "review_text": "Sonic Generations Review by nikfan PLOT 6/10 I liked the plot of this game... But it was really short and was not going anywhere! I really liked Classic and Modern Sonic as characters in this game and Time Eater was interesting before we saw the obvious reveal that the 'The Time Eater' was controlled by Eggman and the Dr.'PINGAS' Robotnik. GAMEPLAY 9.5/10 I must say... This is maybe the most fun I've had with a Sonic Game. I think the control is near perfect, the level design is interesting and not 'tunnel like'. It's a saferide that will give you a lot of pleasure if you are a Classic Veteran or a Modern Veteran(I can't say this for myself... I started out with the Adventure formula... But I still get enjoyment out of Modern and Classic Sonic) But I still think(For me atleast) Modern Sonic was more enjoyable, with all the speedrunning tricks and that speed. Sega got fast with this game...  GRAPHICS 9/10 Graphics look really good. It looks better than Colors and is somewhere on the same level with Sonic Lost World. But it's still not as beatiful as Unleashed. But you can add Unleashed Graphics thanks to the Modding Community. MUSIC 10/10 This is a soundtrack I really enjoyed. All of the tracks were enjoyable and nostalgic giving it that Anniversary feel. My favourite tracks are Sky Sanctuary(all of them), Crisis City(Act 1) and City Escape. I also really enjoy Speed Highway Act 1. That track just sounds like it should be played in a Night Club and I love it :3 REPLAYABILITY 10/10 When the game is pretty fun to replay and speedrun... I must say, one of the best thing about this game is the Modding Community. They work on outstanding mods and they do come out freaquently. So it's a perfect way to come back to the game and try out some awesome modifications people came up with...  OVERALL SCORE: 8.5/10 I really liked this game. But I wanted more from the plot... P.S: Perfect Chaos is... Awesome",

The game is also short if you concentrate on just playing the campaign which i tend to do since I'd rather spend it on other games.  i will probably play 1 strictly old school Sonic game and 1 new sonic game in the enar future ",

            "review_text": "Basically, except the 'remastered' core 2D gameplay and a few good music tracks, everything here is between 'mildly irritating' and 'batshit awful'. 3D-Sonic levels suffer from little to none playtesting, and so are flooded with both technical and design missteps. This situation tops at bosses -- they annoy and bore at the same time, and are completely screwed up with bugs. By the way, 'annoying and boring' is also true about cutscenes -- I can't call them a story, it's just that -- and every single character, both Sonics included (yep, the 'old' Sonic does alright with being unbearable and mute at once).  That said, gameplay is not brilliant at all. Levels for 2D-Sonic are mostly okay, although they suffer from several strange design decisions. Favorite case -- signs for death pits placed in such manner they rather mock your fatal error than give valuable info. Ironically, 2D-sections for 3D-Sonic (oh yeah, his levels aren't 100% 3D, with constant frustrating shifts of perspective) might play somewhat better because of 'modern' Sonic's moves serving as last chance of escaping stupid death. If you won't step into another glitch, of course.  But all could be forgiven (or tolerated) if the assets are great. Well, first of all, there are not much of them: only nine locations, each from a different series' entry, and each divided between two Sonics -- 18 levels, plus horrible bosses (and a miriad of challenge missions that reuse main levels). Decent amount, but certainly not a great nostalgic trip to all the places of glory. I don't give a damn about modern Sonic games, so I don't particularly hate them -- but only one location per each of the first three games? Come on already. That just doubles the bad taste from poor QA.  All in all, too much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for a few good moments. If this is the 'best Sonic game since Sonic &amp; Knuckles' as some internet folks say, all the others must've been flat out horrible.",

If you buy a Sonic game, it´s because you want to go fast. I shouldn´t have to wait for a platform to come back or for the level event to end to continue moving. If I wanted to do that, I could´ve easily bought a Mario game. Some levels are extremely long, and horribly paced, and at times when you want to go fast, the game will simply not allow it by placing an enemy that, unless you´ve played the same level over and over again (seriously, this game borderlines on trial and error, a lot), you won´t see coming, stoping you dead on your tracks.  I´d recommend it if you´re a hardcore Sonic fan, and if you can deal with bad level design. And yes, the music is great, as usual.  Also, why is this 2011 game so hard to run? Barely any graphic setting and no real way to adjust them. It´s not really well optimized.",

The controls for this game are atrocious. Usually I play fast-paced platformers with a controller to give myself precise movement when going from point A to point B, but the fact that this game can barely keep the button input to controller really bugs me. I can only play 10 minutes of the game before the game purposely messes up my controller scheme and I end up dying. The majority of my deaths in this game come from this problem.  SEGA, it's been 5 years since this game came out. Why havn't you fixed this problem yet?  You people might be saying, 'Well, why can't you just get used to the keyboard controls?' Because the keyboard controls feel wonky controling Sonic around; it works well with the classic stages since they are all 2-D, but in the modern stages is where the problem of controling Sonic comes in, since his stages switch to 3-D. Modern Sonic feels stiff controlling with 4 directional buttons compared to the joystick of a controller.  Overall, I would say just buy a console version of this game. You will enjoy it better than this version. Unless someone can find a solution to the controller problem, I will not recommend this version of the game.",

            "review_text": "Sonic Generations is the game that really took a good, long look at Sonic and answered the very important question: why did Sonic never make the jump to 3D successfully?  The answer, unfortunately, is that Sonic was never actually all that good in the first place, and this game merely throws this into sharp relief.  Sonic Generations' fundamental premise is a split between the past and the present - half the stages in the game are old-school, 2D platformer stages similar to what you would have experienced on the Sega Genesis, but with much nicer graphics, while the other half of the stages in the game are new, 3D platformer stages rather like those in the new Sonic games.  You would think that the 2D levels, being 'good sonic', would be better, and on the whole that's correct, but really, the 3D stages aren't terrible by comparison in many cases - sure, they do have some obnoxious things to them here and there, but many of them flow fairly decently.  The real problem is that the game is never really excellent, even though the earlier stages draw very heavily on the first few sonic games for their stages and mechanics. The sad truth is that the game really points out what is wrong with Sonic - that going incredibly fast and precision platforming are utterly at odds with each other, and while the loop-de-loops and other things that Sonic goes through were cool back in the day when the graphics looked really slick, nowadays, even with top-of-the-line graphics, you realize that it just is spectacle - there's no real substance to those parts, while the actually substantive parts, while okay, are not amazing.  The game isn't terrible, but it isn't great either; it is okay on the whole. If you want to play a 2D/3D platforming game, you could do worse - and would be, if you played any other modern Sonic game. But if you're looking for a great new game to play, I'd go elsewhere - the game is okay, not awesome, but, alas, Steam does not allow a 'meh'.",

The game is divieded into 2d and 3d levels. The 3d levels have abysmal controls, and minimal interaction. At it's deepest the gameplay most closly resembles temple run. The 2d levels are slightly better, but also suffer from sluggish controls, poor level design and just generally easy and uninteresting gameplay. I get that this is for the kids, but I struggle to belive that even an 8 year old, or someone who writes erotic sonic fan fiction on deviant art would find this game fun. After beating the levels twice, you get to repaly them again with the added gimic of chalenges, which basically play out exactly the same, except in some instance slower. In the knuckles chalenges, for example, you have to frequently stop and dig for coins as you play through a level you just beat so you can unlock a slow and tedious boss battle that's impossible to die at. After trudging through the first set of levels, I was unable to go any further. If you're thinking about getting this game for yourself or your kids do yourself or them a favor and pick up sonic 1-3, sonic and knuckles or sonic spinball instead.",

Green Hill Zone: Bad, a stage that makes you feel that you need a homing attack. But some sections were really fun to speedrun through (no classic feel at all) Chemical Plant Zone: Good, homing attack doesn't feel like a requirement and it for some reason gives me the serious, but at the same time cute feel of the original stage. Most played classic Sonic's stage by me.  Sky Sanctuary Zone: Awful, full of ♥♥♥♥ in the way (*cough-cough*EggRobo's*cough-cough*) and again the homing attack feels like a requirement. Speed Highway: Average, but an interesting stage. At some places homing attack does feel like a requirement, but if you can spindash right then you might start to actually like it. City Escape: Trolly, a stage that has a ot of ♥♥♥♥ in your way so I never enjoyed it. And the unexpected truck all over the place... Seaside Hill: Not recommended. I would definitely say that it's a lot more anjoyable to play the stage with the homing attack.  Crisis City: Trolly again... Orange Roofs: I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS ♥♥♥♥ Planet Wisp: I ♥♥♥♥ING HATE THIS ♥♥♥♥ Now for Modern stages: Green Hill Zone: Fits the gameplay, amazing music and cameras (and a beautiful Light Field). I've gotta love that Giant Chopper scene. I never imagined Green Hill Zone would be that great before I played it... Chemical Plant Zone: Awesome at the start. Both 3D and 2D sections are enjoyable. But it's hard to get on the rail at the last part. And again awesome music. Sky Sanctuary Zone: ♥♥♥♥ IN THE ♥♥♥! Speed Highway: Good at the start. If you can stay on the top pathways then it's one of the most enjoyable modern stages. City Escape: Y U DO THIS, SEGA &amp; Sonic Team? Seaside Hill: The stage itself is slow-paced but it seems to quite fit the gameplay. Overall average. Crisis City: *♥♥♥♥♥♥s* Orange Roofs: ♥♥♥♥ IN THE ♥♥♥! Planet Wisp: ♥♥♥♥ IN THE ♥♥♥!  Now let's talk about Super Sonic Classic Super Sonic: ♥♥♥♥ IN THE ♥♥♥! Modern Super Sonic: MEAN ♥♥♥♥ IN A MEAN ♥♥♥!  Bosses and rivals Metal Sonic: boring Giant Mech: The only boss/rival I like.

It has some corny cutscenes and the dialogue is pretty sub-par, but that doesn't detract from the engaging gameplay, graphics and music, and if Sega continues on this path (uh-oh, my scepticism is kicking in) the future may be brighter.",

They finally didn't screw this up, the gameplay is fun, addictive, and innovative for a sonic game, if you played sonic when you were a kid this game will take you back, its fast paced platforming like Sonic should be. The games major draw backs are its voice acting, dialogue, and plot. Tails's voice still sounds like a mouse getting ♥♥♥♥♥, it seems like sonic can only remember the bad sonic games and makes inside jokes about them, and the plot revolves around you saving those characters that you really never ever in your life cared about, im talking about Rouge, Amy and that Crocodile, you know, that one. But you aren't playing this for character or plot development, your playing this because Sega finally didn't ♥♥♥♥ up a sonic game by putting hedgehog on human bestiality.",

There are two different versions of each level, the 'Classic Sonic' one which is completely 2d and in which sonic only has his jump and his spin dash, and the 'Modern Sonic' one which also includes 3d sections and in which sonic has a 'boost' and a homing attack. The levels are great, sadly there are only nine levels for both 'modern' and 'classic' sonic, bringing the total to 18. There are special challenge level variations on these nine levels, but these mostly recycle from the nine main levels. There are also bosses and rival battles, which are decent. The game only has preset settings for PC, but 'high' looks pretty good.",

Fast forward to 2010 where my son, a newly indoctrinated Sonic fan due to the Sonic X DVDs his aunt bought him had persuaded me to buy him Sonic Colors on the Wii. As I watched him play, I was fascinated my the new formula Sonic Team had applyed to this game. A hybrid of 3D high speed reflex-based platforming and 2D precision platforming. Sonic had finally found a home in the modern era of gaming. Sonic Team has refined that formula to near perfection for my son's generation and was kind enough to painstakingly replicated the retro style of Sonic games of the past for my generation.

They definitely did this game right. It even got me a bit more adjusted to the Modern era Sonic games and how they play, so if I ever get Sonic Adventure (1 or 2) or any of the moden Sonic games, I'll be more familiar with them and enjoy them as well.

Running fast and moderate platforming. And not anything else.  No playing as Sonic's slow moving friends, no fishing, no lengthy treasure hunting for emeralds, no werehogs, or any of the other experimental gameplay that diverged from what makes the series memorable. Just running fast and platforming.  The gimmick is having a mix of oldschool 2D and modern 3D Sonic levels. Thankfully both are a blast and capture the best parts of their respective styles. While the game stumbles due to some frustrating optional levels that guest star Sonic's friends, overall the gameplay is well paced and pushes the strengths of the series.  Plus it features both Vector the Crocodile and Blaze the Cat! Vector because his 90's cool attitude can't be held down. And Blaze because the game had room for one cat character and she is clearly superior to Big the Cat in every way. At least as far as anthropomorphic cats go.

It improves tunes from your favourite sonic games, be it Sonic CD, Sonic Adventure 2 or even one of your childhood favourites, Sonic Heroes. Another great feature of this game is the stages. They use either 2D (When you're playing as Classic Sonic) or 3D (When you're playing as Modern Sonic) , so the fans of each era are satisfied. The only problem with this is that they did not have an option on whether to pick 3D or 2D. Sure, it may have increased the amount of development time, but playing as modern sonic, but playing as modern sonic against metal sonic would have been a blast. On the other hand, bringing back old bosses such as Shadow and Silver was an ingenious idea - going against Shadow was fun. However, the PC controls for certain bosses make them extremely hard, even if they aren't meant to be. On average, the Shadow boss fight is meant to be 3-5 minutes. It took me 22 minutes to complete it, because you can't use the 'change path' button (Like the one on the daytime stages of Sonic Unleashed). But it is a great game, and it temporarily lifted the par of Sonic game quality - that is, until the abomination known as 'Sonic Lost World' contaminated this planet. 7/10.",

Boss fights also alternate between the two sonics. Sometimes you come across a 2D part in the middle of a 3D course, but you never come across a 3D part in a 2D course. I'm not a fan of the 2D segments, so I was always a bit bummed when I would run across a 2D segment in the middle of a 3D level. The game already has you complete both 2D and 3D courses, why does 2D also get to invade 3D courses?  The level design is pretty solid but keep in mind they definitely change things around - so your old favorite level isn't 100% the same. The music is good and there's a lot of it. They've remixed a lot of old tracks from the other games.   If you like Sonic then you won't be disappointed with this game. If you don't like Sonic then this game won't change your mind.",

Even though there have been a lot of duds in the Sonic the Hedgehog series, Sonic Generations is a truly fun and very well-made. Unlike most Sonic games that are strictly 2D or 3D, Sonic Generations has you flip between classic Sonic (for 2D levels) and modern Sonic (for 3D levels).   The great part about is that you get a different perspective on the different stages, such as when playing the 3D version of a stage from a 2D Sonic game and vice versa. The game also has an RPG element in that you can equip different skills for classic/modern Sonic.   The stages in the game are fast paced and really fun to play. Holding the boost button while running through a loop de loop or down a straight path never gets old. The classic Sonic stages offer some great platforming whereas modern Sonic stages are a lot more action-oriented.   Like most other games, Sonic Generations definitely has some flaws. Just like the god-awful camera in Sonic Adventures 1 &amp; 2, Sonic Generations (in the 3D levels) has camera issues that can be frustrating. Additionally, the boss fights can be extremely frustrating and unfair. The first boss fight in particular was more difficult than it had to be because the camera angles were just terrible and it was hard to see what I was doing. Some of the challenge levels (especially those with Sonic's friends) can be very frustrating as well.   Even with those flaws, I really enjoyed Sonic Generations.

I've played the game passed the second boss and have literally had 9 of the 12 levels(both 3d and side scroller levels) involve some glitch that forces me to die and lose a life(btw no one uses lives anymore Sega) or exit the level completely and lose all checkpoints, and on 4 different occasions had the camera for the 3d levels just randomly flip to an angle where you couldn't see in front of you more than a few inches. I do find the game fun tho, It is probably the best Sonic game to come out in 2 decades or so and has a mildly interesting story and I loved the recreation of some past levels with both 3d and side scrolling verions. Once again tho, I can't stress enough just how buggy this game is, If they would make patches to fix the bugs this game would be gold.",

Many of the features that were frustrating in the past have been corrected and inserted into the remakes of the levels (Spin dashing in Sonic 1 for instance), for about 80% of each level that is a remake, it's exactly the same as the original, but they usually throw in a twist at the end of it which keeps things interesting.  I abandoned Sonic for quite a while after Adventure 2, but this game proves the series isn't ready to die yet, it's still got a lot of life and for the first time in a while, it looks like Sonic might have a bright future. Honestly, if they kept this formula and released a Generations 2, I'd buy it.  At the price, if you've ever enjoyed a Sonic game in your life, it's worth it, it's got it's strange bugs, but the levels are short and replayable, and the extra bonus challenges can teach you some pretty in-depth things you never thought about before.

            "review_text": "Sonic Generations succeeds in crafting a coherent game from a 'Greatest Hits' collection. Classic and Modern Sonic exist side by side in stages ripped from past and present games adapted to suit each Sonic's play style while maintaining the spirit of the original design. The controls are solid, the levels are gorgeous, and obstacles don't destroy momentum. It's everything you could hope for from a Sonic game because it's made up of every other Sonic game alongside modern sensibilities. The Red Ring collectables hidden in every stage give an incentive for exploration without requiring Sonic to rein in his mad dash just to complete the stage. Challenges present the stages in a different way, calling into focus the individual elements that made that stage/game special. And both extras feed into Generations' function as a nostalgia-fest by rewarding collection or completion with art, music, and abilities from previous games. Every part of the game comes together to support a celebration of the Sonic series and it all just works. This stops in the last third of the game, when the stages start to represent the games in what is known as the Dark Age of Sonic. These stages are chock full of random holes in level design, ledges that are just a little too far while maintaining momentum, and enemies that are timed to hit at the exact moment of contact. The simple fun of quick decisions made while dashing as fast as possible though beautiful landscapes drops away after the fifth life spent on a bottomless pit there was no way of knowing about or an enemy standing just out of range of the next jump. The final boss doesn't change the tone either. The previously tight controls kind of just fall apart with the rest of time and space which just so happens to be blocking any possible view of what the boss is doing. The flaws of the game's final third try to cloud out everything the first two thirds did so well, replacing an easy fun with frustration. But this hasn't stopped me from coming back to Generations time and time again. Maybe it's a good game with a few bad parts, just like the series it seeks to celebrate. Maybe I'm nostalgic and delusional.",

            "review_text": "So, I thought I should finally review this game. This is Sonic Generations. The game was made for Sonic's 20th anniversary and so they wanted to include stages from past sonic games. To mix it up, each stage featured has a Classic and Modern sonic act.   Classic sonic's stages are all 2D, taking you back to the Sonic 1,2 and 3&amp; Knuckles days. And I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised at the way they pulled it off. The control is good, the mechanics are familiar and the stages are beautiful. However, I prefer Modern sonic.  Modern sonic's stages are set in 3D. Like previous sonic games you are given the ability to boost, homing attack and lightspeed dash through stages. The control is perfect, the mechanics can be fun (although frustrating at times, I'm looking at you lightspeed dash!) and the stages look beautiful (although a little too linear). Although Modern sonic has 3D stages, portions of the stage are played in 2D. I feel this is to mix it up a bit, and it also adds a bit more complexity to the stages (albeit still quite linear). Sometimes you feel as though you don't need to do anything due to loops and straight paths. Overall, the gameplay is fun.   The story is, at best, ok. But, I don't really play sonic games for a deep story, I play cuz I wanna go fast! Anyway, the plot involves a mysterious being ripping through time and space, making you go through old stages to bring back colour. I won't go much further than that but you get the idea. The 2 sonics meet and work together to save the world. Moving on.  Now, this game is soooo much better than the abomination known as Sonic '06, however, it is incredibly short. You can complete the main story in just a few hours and the challenges are just another way to make you replay old stages with different objectives. Don't get me wrong, I like challenges. But, not when you are forced to do a few to progress in the story! That was annoying. But, meh. Whatever. Anyway, the other things to do are to complete all of the challenges, find all of the red rings and defeat bosses on a harder difficulty. This adds a few more hours (depending on how good you are). Red rings unlock concept art and additional music. Speaking of music...  The music is superb. Absolutely wonderful! Remixed tracks of old songs, updated modern versions and some awesome tracks that get you hyped! The soundtrack is amazing! I couldn't expect anything less from a sonic game! Trust me, it's great.  Now, lets move on to the thing I have been itching to talk to you about... MODS!!! Yes, Sonic + Mods = AWESOMENESS!!! This game has an amazing modding community and some incredible mods out there. Want to play the stages from Unleashed, well you can! Want to see metal sonic fighting a shadow android, well you can. Want to watch Hatsune Miku rolling around at the speed of sound? Well, guess what, you can!!!! WOOO MODS!!! Just download sonic gmi and some mods and prepare for a whole lot of fun! This is why buying games on PC rocks!

The modern gameplay is extremely fun and my personal favorite gameplay style to boot in any sonic game. All of these levels are fanastic roloercoaster rides with multiple pathways, memorable set-pieces, and controls that perfectly fit the level design. What my favorite aspect of this game is the fact that these gameplay-styles are in one game. There is variety but there is no one dominite gameplay style that is more polished than the others. In Sonic Adventure 2, I enjoyed the whole game very much, but the mech and treasure-hunting stages were clearly not as developed as the speed stages. The main problem I have with this game is that there isn't enough of it. The game feels just a tad to short and I wish more games got representation, like Sonic CD and Shadow the Hedgehog (if Sonic 2006 gets a level than Shadow gets one too) as well as an original final leve. The missions are fun but I wished the meshed them into more real levels. The bosses are fun, with the exception of the dull final boss, but yet again I wish there were more.

            "review_text": "I'll admit that most Sonic games aren't that good, but the few times they're good they're really good. Sonic Generations is thankfully one of those. There's 2 gameplay styles: classic and modern Sonic. Classic Sonic plays almost exacly the classic 2D games, which is a great thing. The major difference is that the spin dash is very powerfull. It's a more limited style, but it's definitely Sonic. The modern Sonic plays like the day stages of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors, with 3D boost-based stages mixed with some 2D sections. And this is how a 3D Sonic should be, giving a great sensation of speed. There's 9 stages each with 2 acts, act 1 for classic and act 2 for modern. The main stages are based on a selection of stages from past Sonic's, and they are greatly designed, even if i feel that the selection could be better. Each act has 5 separate challenges, however they're mixed. They feel a bit rushed and like a cheap way to add more game time. For example, 1 of these challenges is just a time trial of the main stage. But there's a few that i enjoyed. There's also 7 bosses in total, and they are generally good, except for the last boss. One thing that is missing here are special stages, but perhaps it is better without them. You can also get and equip skills with various effects, including Super Sonic. The story is very basic but it gets the job done. And the soundtrack is amazing, with great remixes from the original songs. As a whole, the game feels a bit rushed and incomplete. It's like the developers first put their effort on the main stages (thankfully), and then rushed the challenges and maybe the bosses, scrapping special stages. There's also an online mode, but it's just the main stages with leaderboards. There's also an addictive 30 second trial for each stage. The PC version unfortunately isn't well optimized, but there's plenty of mods out there to increase your play time. I personally recommend at least the Unleashed Project mod, but you should try some more of them, especially stage mods. While the game could have more content, what's here is mostly pretty good. If you're a Sonic fan, this game is a must have. Even if you're not but are curious, Sonic Generations is one of the best ways to see what (the good) Sonic games are all about. But get it on sale.",

A lot of cool action set pieces throughout the levels making the experience overall just more better. The boss fights were not as good as the rest of the game however, the final boss in particular is just awful. Story is generic and I could not care less about any of these characters but the game itself is very fun to play.  7/10 (Good) ",

No.  The levels are well designed and iconic, the gameplay is fairly solid, and the music is downright brilliant.  However, I have to say that this game is a bit short.  Also, its Sanic.

            "review_text": "This the best modern Sonic title to be released on PC thus far, and it's worth every penny in my honest opinion. I honestly haven't had this much fun playing Sonic since Sonic Adventure 1 &amp; 2, but those games are pretty much action adventure titles on crack instead of proper platformers..   The developers did an amazing job recapturing that nostalgic feel from the original Genesis titles while stll being able to incorporate modern graphics, well polished mechanics, and quite a few features such as skill customization and the ability to play as Classic Sonic on proper 2D platforming stages and Modern Sonic on 3D platforming stages.  The game has quite a lot of replayability when you account for all of the challenges, collecting all of the red coins, and obtaining an S-Rank on everything that you possible can, but wait, there's more to do once you start exploring the modding scene and checking out various mods such as Sonic Generations Unleashed and the assortment of adventure packs ranging from Sonic 2 to Sonic 2006 and Colors.  You honestly can't go wrong with this title if you're looking for a proper Sonic title on PC; although, the more severe cons that I can think of is the lack of the Chao Garden and a dying modding scene that will probably pick back up once stuff like Sonic Generations Unleashed 2.0 is finished and released.  Note: I have zero idea as to how the game plays via mouse+keyboard since I use my Xbox One gamepad for playing anything that doesn't require absolute precision such as games in the FPS and Strategy genres.",
