Pros: + nice design, different maps / locations + playable in singleplayer, coop, multiplayer + different modes (e. g. defending a barricade, survival, king oft he hill, free play) + convenient music, good sound + different survivors with special abilities + all options possible (graphic, audio and so on) + selectable level of difficulty + you can turn friendly fire on/off, collect exp together or alone + a ton of zombies and massive growing waves  + many different weapons which you get by killing the zombies + health kits, short-term skills (also by killing zombies) + levelsystem (you can choose an ability with every new level) + players can resurrect teammates at any time  + 140 achievements to hunt, leaderboards + IT MAKES FUN!  Cons: - no story (in Singleplayer you have missions, but no profound story)  This game is for people who really enjoy using many different weapons, having action all the time, killing non stop zombies without thinking much and without a break. So hm I love the game. lol   Original price: 8,99 € Summersale: 2,24 €",

It's a simple game of point, shoot, powerup and repeat as you mow down hordes of zombines across some relatively generic levels. While the addition of things like 'boss zombies' changes things up a bit, overall the experience is fairly repetative. It's fairly mindless and at times, frantic, which I guess makes it a good game to play if you want to get your mind off of things and just let loose for awhile.",

            "review_text": "Normally when I think of zombies I think 'oh no they're going to bore me to death'. Seriously, zombies are the most played-out garbage when it comes to videogames. There are so many and they move slowly and ZZzzzzz it's like zombie game developers give up before they wrote their first line of code.  Nation Red however is one of the few legitimately great zombie games. It's an overhead arena shooter, the closest comparison would be Smash TV. Survival isn't just about gunning down the undead, it's also being able to clear paths to get those necessary powerups. Leveling up allows access to numerous special abilities. Some are plain in their functionality like better armor, while others add firepower (venomous darts, acts of God, random explosions), and still others help develop a player's 'build' (stronger sentry guns, better stats at the cost of extraneous weapons). This is part of what makes this game so maddeningly addictive.   As the game progresses the zombie hordes become stronger, their numbers become overwhelming, and death is eventually little more than a bad button press away. At this point the game becomes immensely satisfying. The mechanics aren't as tight as I would like. Melee in general is very iffy and accidentally picking up a crowbar or an axe is almost as bad as diving right into an explosion. Otherwise I don't have any complaints. Online play and a multitude of modes are also nice additions.  Honestly the only reason I don't play this game all the time is because I still have 200+ other games on my Steam account to try. It's that darn good.  Give Nation Red a shot sometime. This is one of those games that tends to drop to 90% off during Steam sales so you won't be hurting for the cash to afford it.  ",

As a single player game, it's decent fun and offers a really solid challenge, though sometimes bordering on unfair. However, the random drops help to change things up a little, and you can lock onto a weapon when you find one you like (Steam Hammer, anyone?)  It doesn't have a story, it doesn't really offer anything new after the first 5 minutes, and it doesn't have the greatest visuals or soundtrack... but what it does offer is pure, explosive fun.",

It may not be for everyone and I'm sure that looking at some gameplay (single or multiplayer) videos will dictate to you whether such is the case for you. I think this is a nice and solid action title for an indie collector to have. Good number of characters, weapons, and modes all well designed and fun to play  The game-altering upgrades make it consistantly enjoyable to slaughter your way through zombies that get progressively harder, and therein more satisfying to avoid death at their hands. As you acquire new upgrades, you yourself will start to feel like a walking, zombie-slaying machine while you spit venomous darts and saw blades passively and friendly explosive strikes rain down on the zeds around you.  One of those titles that makes you want to beat that high score. whether it be a friend's, a stranger's, or just your own.  As far as negative aspects, I will say it can get repetative. It's probably not a game you'll be playing constantly or for more than a couple hours at a time, but I believe you'll be happy to have it at your disposal when the itch returns to slaughter something to cure a brief bout with boredom.  Anyway. I liked it. ",

You get infinite ammo, mega pickups, and hordes and hordes of zombies to murder brutally.  In most modes, you get to choose 'perks' for every score threshold you reach. Perks range from simple things like increased Armor or faster Reloading, to some crazier things like setting zombies on fire for being near you and causing the Turbine pickup to nom zombies.  There are perks that come in perk tiers to upgrade specific pickups - for example, the Fire Team perk upgrades the Ghost pickup so that your Ghost friend carries a shotgun instead of a pistol. Get both Mirror Image and Fire Team, and you get two shotgun ghosts for the pickup. Upgrade to Strike Team and Wild Bunch... and you get FOUR Auto-shotgun wielding Ghost friends to fight by you for a short time.  This game will keep you on your toes the entire time you play.
