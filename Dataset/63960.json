            "review_text": "Uh..... Best game ever. Recommended to those who love the Vietnam War and WWII, this games takes you in between those times and lets you take your first steps into Korea. Play as the North Koreans and crush the Americans under your fist, the Americans and beat the crap out of the North Koreans, or the USSR, and just be awesome. Gameplay is amazing, stunning graphics with epic units and stunningly detialed maps with mountains, rivers, and rice paddies. You can also create your own maps and campaigns, amazing indeed. Highly recommended 9/10.",
