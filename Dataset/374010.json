I originally owned this game on Sega CD. This game is short. Given that it was originally bundled with 2 other cases when it first came out. This game is alot better than I expected it to be given that I played the original version, either concerning video or the interface itself I came in expecting my experience on Sega CD and was suprised that it was better. Hopefully they might release Volume II or III. I did not hate the game and found it interesting. It's probably not for everybody and there are really better Sherlock games out there. I bought it for Nostalgia purposes. If you want to step into FMV history this is a good example of it. Would I reccomend buying it? Yes. But depending on what you want to buy it for. I bought it for nostalgia purposes. The game is decent, has it aged? Maybe a little....",
