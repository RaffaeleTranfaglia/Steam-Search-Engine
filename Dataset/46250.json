The thing is, it's quite bugged and if you dont tweak the graphic settings you'll get a blurred image..  Also, change the damn FOV, and remove things like motion blur! and ignore the ironsights! For most of the weapon is useless. This way you'll have a lot of fun :-)  tl;dr PRO -secrets -old style fps -tons of guns  CONS -glitchy -'strange'-'blurred' graphics",

I joined because it was a free game I stayed for the graphics I stopped playing in the first level due to over repetitivity ihe level feeling very long and the allied cadets randomly just disappeared (looked af they fell through the ground)",

            "review_text": "If Necrovision were doom, this would be half life 1. Slightly less killy killy, but a lot more interaction with neutral and allied characters, no lame stuff like story or whatever, but there are interesting characters that you see around the campaign, some of them last through most of the game. Others say hello, fight through hell with you, then die offscreen without Zimmerman paying attention to them. What I liked best was that you got to have a lot of fights with allies, which built upon the cool WW1 theme.  However, unlike what is suggested, you don't play zimmerman during his evil psycho necromancy phase, you play him up until that point. So you don't get to be evil in this one.",
