    "description": "Snapshot is the tale of a lone robot lost in an abandoned world. Armed with only his trusty camera, Pic sets forth on his great adventure. A camera might not seem like enough for a puzzle platforming adventure, but this camera is different from most: It has the ability to capture and remove from the world the very objects that it...",

            "review_text": "Really, I'm on the border line with recommending this game. It's visuals are stunning, the audio is great. The background music can get a bit repetitive, but the tunes are calm enough that you don't mind. The concept is wonderful, I'm a big fan of puzzle games and when I saw where this game started I was very excited.  But it sort of flat-lined. Even within the first world I was getting bored. There was just enough new concepts introduced to keep me playing, but I found the difficulty of the game to not be in the puzzle-solving but in the controls. I knew exactly what to do, but I couldn't get my darn keyboard-touchpad-click combo control madness to make it happen. Definitely needs to let you map your own controls. Also probably best played with a mouse, because with a touchpad it is near impossible.  The story could also use a little work. A good storyline can save a bad game sometimes. But this had little story, and relied entirely on the puzzle-solving, which as previously mentioned was weak. 100%ing this game would get really tedious. If you're into that kind of thing, this is for you. Definitely worth a try though. If you get it in a bundle or as a gift, cool.",

Pros: Creative overall idea  Cons: - Some items appear to need to be placed on slanted surfaces and there is seemingly no way to prevent the object you place on these surfaces from rolling due to the game's physics.",

The first few levels start off not bad, but then pretty soon you're hit with the terrible level design with no checkpoints. It becomes quickly frustrating to start a level all the way over when you fall into spikes right near the end of the level due to the poor floaty controls of your character. Also new mechanics are quickly added into the game, for example springs get added one level and then the next some elephants get added all which are implemented poorly and become difficult to utilize. Most people do not even progress far in the game, only ~11% of players have unlocked Chapter 2!",

But not only this, you can't really control your jumps and nothing is precise, resulting in this slow die and retry until your nerves breakout.  One must be not really objective to say this game is bad, because in itself, the design is well thought, the levels are interesting, I see all the efforts from the devs... Definitely convincing! And it's only pumping up my frustration against the metrics...  I wouldn't recommend that game for my friends or player like me. Maybe a beginner in the platform kind of game, or a kid (totally suitable for a kid with fairy graphics and mood, no violence, ...) who has a lot of patience.
