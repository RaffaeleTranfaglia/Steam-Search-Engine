I like the setyup of the game, it is older but acceptable graphics. Has a lot of content actually. Devs really should come back and add a card set and achievements to make the purchase a bit more 'worth it'. But if you can catch it on sale it's a nice litle game. I don't like giving a Neg to a 'medium' game. So I always opt for the UP vote. Again, it's alright, nothing to eb overly dissapointed with.",
