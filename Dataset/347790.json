            "review_text": "First: Do not mistake this for another Sim Earth! It is a puzzle game.  That being said, Terraform is a very challenging puzzle game with a lot of different elements that interact in plausible ways (shovels dig holes, hot weather dries soil, cold weather freezes water, etc.) The plausibility makes it easy to remember the rules of interaction. It starts of easy and gets pretty tough towards the end. If you like a challenge, this is the game for you. An editor promises unlimited puzzling fun.",
