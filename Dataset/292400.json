    "description": "Unrest is a role playing adventure game set in a fantasy interpretation of ancient India that adapts to death, failure, and the choices you make. Play as ordinary people in a struggle for safety, freedom, and a chance at peace. Use conversation, manipulation (and rarely, violence) to achieve your goals.",

            "review_text": "First of all, this is a low budget indie title. Doesn't hurt to know that before, because half an hour into the game you'll just forget that fact.  I went in without much of an expectation and ended up absolutely loving every minute of it. Great story, beautiful writing, a LOT of freedom to shape the characters personalities and their fate. Best of all: the ambiguity and inherent realism of this fantasy. Do not expect a conventional good vs evil epic. Or even better: expect it ;)  If you're infuriated by the rather unsatisfying end, do a little research about what the developers had in mind artistically and judge then. It is a matter for debate still and seems much less thought through than the rest of the game, but I get their idea. Unfortunately it reduces the motivation to replay a little. Also on the downside: Ingame movement could be a lot faster, I came to loathe staircases, because they slow you down like you're wading through a swamp. Having to stand in certain spots before being able to talk to someone got on my nerves too. But these are minor issues.  Clear recommendation to buy. I can't wait for their next title.",

            "review_text": "When I first got Unrest I was expecting it to be just another point and click adventure game based around storytelling, I was wrong. Unrest is not just 'another one', I'll even go as far as to compare this to the Walking Dead game from Telltale. If you're looking for a real RPG that focus on narrative instead of combat you should just get this one right away.  Unlike most RPGs Unrest doesn't let you create a character to your liking, instead it lets you play as multiple ones such as a peasant girl, a priest, a slum inhabitant, an ambassador from a mighty empire and a mercenary captain. You play all these characters in Bimhra, which to my understanding is a city located in a fictional ancient India.  Like I've mentioned previously, Unrest focuses on a narrative driven experience based around dialogue with NPCs. The dialogue is what makes the game in this case, the writing is fairly good however I felt like the English translation was abit off and I noticed some letters missing every here and there but nothing that really stops you from understanding what the game is trying to tell you. The dialogue basicly works like most RPGs such as Mass Effect and likewise, each NPC you encounter in the game will react different from another depending on which dialogue options you choose. The choices are presented in a single sentece and each one of them has like a 'title' or an indicator, if you prefer, that helps you better understand if you're being 'hard' or 'naive' or 'sarcastic', things like that.  You can pretty much be who you want with any of the characters, when playing as peasant girl you can be harsh on people or caring and nice, it's up to you, the game lets you play as you wish. However, playing in a certain way will have it's consequences. I'm pretty sure I can't explain to you how it works by giving you an exact example because that will spoil the story. Just think like this 'If I do X with one character it will have X effect later on.' and this creates room for some replayability if you wish to go back after beating the game and take other choices other than the ones you took on your first playthrough. It's also worth noting that some of these playable characters know each other and sometimes saying something with another character will affect another one. Usually, between the transition from one character to another some time passes by, if I recall correctly it's usually a few months so very often things in the world will be abit different from the time you played with the last character.   In other words the game lets you roleplay by choosing what your character says to someone and different choices will lead to different outcomes that can completely change the plot.  Upon talking with different people you'll unlock lore in your Journal which contains various types of information ranging from the story behind a certain location or information about someone vital to your quest.  Visually the environments look absolutely gorgeous but I really don't like the way the character models look and how the walking animations look. It's also worth noting that the music in the game does a really great job, right when the music kicked in I could feel myself lost somewhere in India.  If you're not really sure about this one just download the demo and give it a try. There's no way I can't possibly not recommend Unrest, if you're into narrative driven games or RPGs that focus on storytelling rather than combat or customization, Unrest is a game you should get your hands on!",

            "review_text": "You know...even if I am giving this game a thumbs down it does not mean its a bad game. I like the fact it has no combat and is completely dialog based. The problem is that it has no ending at all and is less than three hours long. Stay away for now, but, when the mod support kicks off and if the developers add more to the story..then go for it. Its a good start..but thats all. The conversations though are very well written and interesting, drawing some alagories to real life even though it uses a fantasy setting. Wait a few months and then buy this game..hopefully it will be more complete then.",

            "review_text": "Brilliant game. Essentially, it plays like a choose-your-own-adventure, but the situations you're placed in, and the decisions you have to make, really make you think. It cleverly has you playing a variety of characters on different sides of the unrest, making what appear at first to be black and white issues to be complicated dilemmas.  Games are usually about feeling powerful. The characters you play in Unrest are often powerless, or struggling to make a difference. It's taken me just over 3 hours to complete, and in that time I've felt helpless, I've made decisions I've regretted, and I've done things against my will for the sake of others.  It did end suddenly, but in a way it fits with the game that there's no definitive conclusion. I'm left with both the sense that things could have gone very differently, but also that perhaps what happened was inevitable.",

            "review_text": "Unrest is a very thought provoking 'game'. It's been mis-characterized as a RPG. It's more of a point n click visual novel with choices. The story is very engrossing and touches on a lot of socio-economic and political issues with modern day parallels. It's game that goes out of the way to de-glamorize various roles you end up playing during the game, be it a ruler, mercenary, priest or bride-to-be. It throws a range of gloomy choices at you and there's little escapism in sight.  It's a low budget title and that hampers it from achieving true greatness. While some choices do have irreversible consequences, it could have been done a bit better. The art style is folksy in a way that fits the story, as is the music which does get a little repetitive. However, the graphics, path finding, character models and animations are merely okay.  Overall, this is a neat little game with a big heart which tackles serious issues.  Sometime, I debate whether I should read a book or play a game. When I succumb to my laziness and end up playing a game, I invariably regret the decision. This game was so worth the 5 short hours I put into it. If you like games which deal with social issues and are short (think the Hate series or Papers, Please), then this is a must-play.",

It was implemented and written well throughout the game. I loved the charecters to, they were just written so well. The game will take about 5 hours to finish, yet you will be able to play it diffrently to have difrent outcomes. I would recommend this game to anyone who loves games with a story.",

And I love playing an RPG that doesn't have any combat. All in all, I'd be ready to recommend it wholeheartedly, despite it's slightly home-made production qualities. However, it crashes constantly. Every game session I've played of it so far has ended with the game crashing, sometimes after not a lot of gameplay.   Without the bugs, I'd say to check it out. It's a unique setting, the art and music are lovely within the confines of what the developer could manage, and an RPG set around a set of vignettes wherein the only real factor is conversation is a pretty unique idea. With all the crashes... I'm pretty forgiving, but it's really tough to say. I'll give it a guarded thumbs-up with a warning that it's only for the patient.",

It took me 2 hours to complete the game and i kept replaying the game because it was so good and it had multiple endings. my favorite character was the mercenary captain because of all the authority you have during his story, you dont get that in most games. it was a short game i have to say but when you think about it, 2 hours of mainly dialogue is pretty impressive, this game would be a solid 8 out of 10 for me because the graphics were also very good everything was good except for two things: the price for this game, and the fact that four out of the five characters you only played as once. just a little side note, a sequel doesn't need to be made in order for this game to be a hit, but i personally wouldn't mind a sequel just to see how bhimra turns out.",

            "review_text": "Unrest is an interesting interactive piece of fiction, and it has some really solid ideas regarding the issues it addresses (even if in a fantasy setting) and the way the narrative is told.  The most interesting to me, and a point that should be stressed in video-game storytelling, in my opinion, is not to always give the game a defined plot. Plots aren't very interesting to me. What is interesting, however, is giving you a setting, with questions and different approaches. Then, you can make choices and see how the world reacts. I can't be bothered to remember a plot. Knowing the world I was 'living' in, however, is something that sticks with me.  This game makes you stick with your decisions (although there's also a saving system, if you so wish to use), but it's not perfect in that regard. There were many occasions when the game blocked me some paths that seemed available... it's not very consistent with the doors it closes. One mis-interpretation of the dialogue and you'll have to play the rest of the game with a choice you didn't intend to make. Oh well.     But I'm giving it a thumbs down. Why is that?  Well, above all else, because you play many different characters, several of them in opposing sides of the conflict. It's really hard to 'role-play' in this manner. Also, with the amount of character switching that goes on in the game, it's really hard to keep track who's who. Regardless, the characters you play aren't all that well defined before you start, and will often be in conflict with your previous character.  It's... awkward, honestly. I'd rather play one character and commit to a certain persona, and then have a friend play another character, with a different persona, and see how the world developed.   I don't know, role-playing this many characters in quick succession just feels wrong, especially with the lack of previous characterization. I couldn't really 'defend a point', since the next character might defend the complete opposite.   The game itself isn't bad. The 'game' part is a bit amateur, with animations not really matching the background's perspectives and some clunky systems... but I think it's worth a shot. It's trying something different, and definitely something I'd like to see more of. However, after playing this, I've got to admit that it was completely immersion breaking to be constantly switching characters, often with conflicting views of the world. I just couldn't play all of those roles at once. Would be really cool to see a multiplayer version -- Each person chooses a character and makes their own choices. It would probably have me much more invested!  Still, looking forward to their other games!",

I can play games with much better graphics at 60 fps on this PC.

Just because you're an 'indie' developer, does not mean you can shove games on Steam which is no way superior than a flash game, except for it's story.
