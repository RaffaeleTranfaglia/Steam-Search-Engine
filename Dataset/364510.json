            "review_text": "An excellent game! I've played this since the 0.95 version came out, and it's been great ever since. The base game is actually free and will take about 1-2 weeks to complete. The Corporate Command and Eternity Port expansions add lots more ships, systems, enemies, missions and plot-lines to follow, and are well worth the 8 bucks. This is like Escape Velocity, but better. And a lot more difficult. One caveat though - you can't switch ships, so you're stuck with whatever you picked at the beginning. There's a mod called 'Playership Drones' I remember installing some time ago, it allowed you to buy new ships and even use them as wingmen.  This is really an open-world sandbox, where you can make your own decisions and do whatever you feel like doing. You can escort freighters, mine asteroids, work for the military, engage in piracy, smuggle drugs, even become a gladiator. Be warned though, your actions and choices will always have consequences both good and bad. Gameplay can be very challenging at times, especially the combat which requires good reflexes. Pick the Wolfen gunship and you'll see what I mean. There can be quite a steep learning   curve   cliff, and you'll get blown up. A lot. You can resurrect and pick up from where you left off, with no penalties apart from a lowered high score. On my first play-through I died about 25 times.  Some tips: Learn the trade routes, and how to profit from the black market. Don't hesitate to use exploits like sitting on a planet (they're invulnerable) while waiting for your shields to recharge, or luring enemies to a friendly station to be killed. When about to die, press (I&gt;1). You can attack salvager nomads (big brown ships) and smugglers (gray transports with small escorts) with no penalties. They are easy to defeat and carry good loot. Don't attack the Huari. And definitely don't feed the Teraton fabricator radioactive waste :) Also, remember to have fun and don't get discouraged by the amount of times you get blown up. It's very rewarding when you complete the game at last. Just resurrect and try again. And again.  10/10 would die again.",

            "review_text": "So I finally managed to save up enough money to buy a really powerful, particle resistant shield. Decided to challenge the gladiator arena champion. His blast weapons tore through my shield like it was paper. It was then that I realized, I hadn't upgraded my armor enough. So much for a permadeath run.  10/10 would get horribly outclassed again",

The game? Excellent action, good variety of choices on how to play out your adventure, 10-20 hours of play with incredible replayability thanks to the pletora of mods available. (search for 'Xelerus') And it still worked on. At this time, 'Part II' of the adventure that happens after the end of the game is in development.  If value for money is your thing, this game has you covered.",
