Since this has neither of those, I'd suggest you look elsewhere. This isn't like the NES version people play on Youtube. The UI is cumbersome AND DID I MENTION THERE'S NO SOUND OR MUSIC?! Unless you're one of those who played this back in the day, there are better options out there.  Not recommended even on sale.",
