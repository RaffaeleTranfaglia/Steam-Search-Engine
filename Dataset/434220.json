            "review_text": "Bear Haven Nights claims to be a horror game that's not simply another FNAF clone. The truth is, however, that it isvery similar to FNAF in many ways. Now this is not necessarily a bad thing and will depend on whether or not you liked the FNAF games to begin with. Interestingly, I personally was not a fan of FNAF, however I am finding BHN quite enjoyable.  BHN does a lot of the same things that similar games of the genre do, but it also has enough minor unique differences (at least in my opinion) that give it its own unique feel and style. Obviously, the first thing that is going to stand out is the ability to move around from location to location, which was not a feature of the FNAF series. It could be argued however that this in essence is no different than jumping from camera to camera, and there would be little I could say to refute that, though I'm perfectly ok with that.  The art style is where the game really shines for me. It's a very simple art style indeed, but it gives the game this immense feeling of surrealism as though you may be in the Twilight Zone or inside of a dream. The game is not 'frightening' and the jumpscares are not particularly scary, in comparison to other games that have come out recently (particularly Emily Wants to Play) but what the game lacks in pure fright factor, it makes up in its eerie and very well executed atmosphere. The motel setting no doubt adds to the atmophere as we've all come to associate desolate motels in the middle of nowhere with sinister occurences and crazy characters (Psycho, anyone?).  At the time of writing this, I've played the game for approximately 1.5 hours and am very satisfied with the amount of content and the way it was all put together and executed, and for less than $5, I can't help but recommend that anyone with a taste for these kinds of games give this one a try.  I popped up my first impressions and funny moments videos on YouTube and have linked them here for anyone that's interested in seeing more of the game played in English, as almost all of the videos on YouTube are in Russian, it seems.
