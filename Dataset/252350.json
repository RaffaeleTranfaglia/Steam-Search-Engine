It almost feels like playing a side-scroller Street Fighter game with RPG-esque elements thrown in with shops found throughout the levels. Dodging and countering are very meaningful and give a real sense of achievement when you can successfully fight your way through a crowd taking very little damage or using the environment to your advantage. In addition to your own ability to combo through a crowd, you are also equiped with different 'songs' that equate to abilities/magics, one being a passive buff and the other a special attack. I liked the brawler feel so I went with an absorb health/spin kick combo, it works really well to keep your health up and bulldoze waves of enemies. I really enjoyed the humor of this game, it really hit me in the right spot. The original version of double dragons was among the first games I ever got my hands on and played heck trying to get to work in our overused Nintendo. It feels even more fun to play it as an adult on here than it did as a kid. Even if you're not wearing rose colored glasses like me, this game will rock your socks.",

I like the sound effects too.   If you like these kinds of games 'bralwers' or 'beat-em-ups', you will like this game. I'd like to try the co-op at some point; it sounds fun with optional 'friendly/fire'.  It's one of those games where you get momentum early in the game with extra lives and it will be hard to progress through later levels if you die and need to 'continue.' It can be played casually but to beat it will take practice.",

The Sosetsitsu system is great for a variety of attacks like fireballs or a spin kick and the tape system is great for tweaking stats for different play styles or for changing stats for specific moments like a boss fight. The music by Jake Kaufman is top tier; you will jam to the music while playing the game. If you're a fan of past Double Dragon games, you'll like Neon with its callbacks and references to the past games. If you love the 80s, you'll LOVE this game for the music, references, aesthetic, everything. Neon also has plenty of humor with the Lee brothers one liners and Skullmageddon. All-in-all, a great game I’d recommend anytime.",

            "review_text": "I'm just going to start by clarifying that I have not played any of the original Double Dragon games, so none of my opinions are going to be based off of comparing this game to the original games.  Let's start with what they got right. This game both looks and sounds awesome. The soundtrack is a joy to listen to and the visuals are very pleasing to the eye. However I can't recommend this game because of what it does wrong. The gameplay is difficult in the worst way possible, the totally unfair way. Whether it is unstoppable attacks or not landing a hit because you were just a smidge off on the vertical, this game is massively unfair. Now I've played frustratingly hard games before, but the ones I actually wound up enjoying were the ones that I felt gave me a fair shake in the game, and that when I messed up, it was 100% my fault. This game does not do that for me, and it does help that the controls are a mess. Everything controls slowly. You walk slow, you move vertically slow, and even the sprint is slow with it's half second to a second delay before you actually start running. Plus the duck isn't all that effective, and using it feels more like a roll of the dice to see if you get hit or not.  To me the biggest problem with this game is that it seems that the devs put more focus on the art and music than on the actual gameplay, and that they were looking to make a great looking game instead of a great playing game, which hurts it in my book. Part of me also feels that the devs thought that they could just make the game really good and not worry to much about the gameplay because people are going to like it anyways because it's a Double Dragon game. Because of this, I can't recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "I played this game back when it first came out on the PSN. At first I thought it was going to suck, being just some dumb cash-in on 80's retro.   I ended up loving this game.  The first time I played it was with a friend and we co-opped it in a single sitting. Playing it again, solo, I still had a blast.  For anyone who doesn't know what Double Dragon is, DD was one of the pre-eminent beat 'em ups back in the day. Many series tried to emulate the simplicity of punching, kicking, kneeing, throwing, and spin kicking mobs of bad guys into bloody submission. Few achieved their goal.  And that's really all DD is about: beating the tar out of a colorful cast of villains. The plot is paper thin, and that's okay, we're not really here for the story. DD Neon updated the tried and true formula DD 1 and 2 perfected by adding a ton of special moves and character builds to the mix. That might sound pretty not Double Dragon, but it actually adds a nice bit of depth to simple gameplay. Want to excel at offense? Defense? Physical attacks or special moves? Want to throw a fireball? Some lighting? How about a head crushing knee drop? The options are varied and allow the game to cater to many different play styles.  The graphics are bright, colorful, and varied. The music is insanely good, offering plenty of original tunes as well as some sick remixes of classic songs. And the controls are good. A little slow, but it gives the game a nice pace.  A game like this is why Wayforward is one of my favorite developers. A Boy and His Blob, Ducktales, and Double Dragon: they take classic games and create playable love letters to them.   If you love DD, play this. If you haven't played DD before, but enjoy good arcade style action games, play this.  What are you waiting for? Hurry up, buttlord!",

I'd say about a third of the jokes hit and the rest are cringeworthy. Combat is fun enough and the game is short but there are 2 big problems:  1. The game stutters like crazy. I tried various troubleshooting, but to no avail. My system is powerful enough to play pretty much everything on high settings, but this game stutters. Seems like a really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port.  2. The final boss requires grinding earlier stages to get upgrades. It's the only fight in the entire game that will give you trouble, other than maybe needing an extra shot at a couple stages. Basically, the final boss requires you to have upgraded a couple of your skills at shops on earlier levels. This kills the flow and creates a lot of unwanted padding in a game that should be a play-for-3-hours-and-forget kind of game.  While I like the game itself, these 2 issues are deal-breakers for me in terms of recommending the game. A crucial bad design choice, and a game that should be playable on any system having bad stuttering.",

For the most part the Lee Brothers control fine, if a little floaty and a little slow, but that isn't much of an issue since most of the game is designed around the slower movement speed, including enemy placement and frequency. You'll note that I said, most of the game is designed like that.  This means that there are a few moments where, though 'gittin gud' really is the only way to beat the game's 10 stages, sometimes the game wants to be faster-paced than your characters really are capable of dealing with. Also it does take some cues from its coin-operated older brothers in that the bosses, particularly the final boss, seem designed to eat your quarters with how much damage they can deal.  But that's all offset by infinite continues, with the only real setback being you have to replay the level. This will be kind of discouraging, and might result in a few thrown controllers (please don't throw your keyboard or laptop), but since the game saves at each stage AND what upgrades you get through the game's Mixtape system, these setbacks are more annoying than particularly gamebreaking, and with some dedication you'll eventually get it.  Bottom line, should you buy this game? Well, the only way to answer that is by answering whether or not you like beat-em-ups in the first place. If yes, then yes, buy it. If no, this probably won't make a believer out of you, but if you're curious, get it on sale.  Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome. Just throwing that in there.",

            "review_text": "Double Dragon Neon revitalizes the classic franchise, but a few missteps derail the silly fun.  What would a magical skeleton want with an ordinary woman? The answer isn't important (and is most likely pretty gross), but the rescue mission that follows this kidnapping sure is fun. Double Dragon Neon is a smart update to the arcade classic from decades ago. By melding the iconic characters and traditional beat-'em-up structure from the original Double Dragon with an overhauled combat system that rewards precise defensive counters and clever skill manipulation, Neon is much more than a merry trip down nostalgia lane. Billy and Jimmy Lee do occasionally stumble on their way to vanquishing Skullmageddon, but Double Dragon Neon overcomes that clumsiness with style.  The opening scene sends shivers down your spine. The sultry Marian walks alone down a dark alley, only to be greeted by a gang of lowly street toughs. With one punch to the stomach, she passes out in pain, and the trio of miscreants march away with their prize slung over one shoulder. A garage door opens, and out walk Billy and Jimmy Lee, searching for vengeance. For anyone who has played the original Double Dragon, this situation should be familiar, and the remixed music ties into the 1980s hit. By the time you square off against whip-wielding Linda and the abnormally large Abobo a few minutes into your adventure, you might think that you have a good idea of how this game is going to play out.  But you'd be wrong. Although Neon makes many references to the original game, it doesn't take long for it to forge its own path. It's a side-scrolling beat-'em-up, so the basic left-to-right kickathon is kept intact, but the combat has layers of depth that make it exciting for anyone itching for a challenge. Your basic moves are punches and kicks, and you dole out flashy combos by alternating between these standard techniques. Once you pound enemies in the head a few times, they become stunned, and their vulnerability is your gain. Toss them into a group of enemies or into a bottomless pit if you wish, or you can deliver a crushing uppercut that suspends them in midair long enough for you to juggle them like a hacky sack.  Don't leave me hanging, bro!  Making smart use of these core mechanics leads to satisfying encounters. A half dozen or more enemies often flood the screen, and you need to attack with precision if you're going to keep the crowd at bay. Mashing buttons delivers jaw-breaking attacks, but you won't get far if you ignore your defensive maneuvers. The Lee brothers have a handy duck technique that becomes the foundation for your success as the difficulty ramps up. By hitting the ground right as an enemy attacks, you avoid damage and you gain a gleam bonus. This makes you twice as strong for a few seconds. Mastering the gleam makes even the toughest bosses pushovers, but it takes practice to get the timing down. Sadly, finicky collision detection sometimes means you get hit even if you moved well in advance. Also, you earn the gleam bonus only by ducking. If you roll or jump out of the way, you still avoid pain, but there's less incentive without the temporary strength boost.  The avoid-and-attack rhythm of combat is strengthened by perks you unlock as you play. Called songs, these add passive and special abilities to your repertoire. If you're dying too quickly, you may want to imbue your character with more health, or you could add damage bonuses when you land successive attacks. Super attacks are just as specialized. A screen-clearing, flaming dragon deals out a ton of damage but drains your magic bar, whereas the one-inch punch doesn't deplete as much health, but you can pull it off more often.  As rewarding as it is to mix and match the perfect abilities for your style, the leveling-up aspect drags the adventure down. Extra songs can be purchased at stores or collected from defeated enemies, and the more you have, the more potent the ability. But unlocking the full potential of these buffs demands tedious grinding. You need to kill bosses to earn the precious currency needed to raise the limit of how many songs you can carry, so you have to repeatedly play through levels to make your character strong enough to survive. This isn't a huge problem in the default difficulty because ducking at the right time and then laying the smack down is enough to defeat anyone, but things become significantly more challenging on the harder difficulty settings. When only one or two hits can take you down, you need your abilities maxed out, and that takes hours of tedious busywork.  Bimmy and Jimmy never looked better.  If you want to conquer Neon, you need to spend a lot of time punching fools, but just having fun doesn't take any investment. The over-the-top atmosphere not only taps into your happy memories, but introduces a layer of ridiculousness that wasn't present in the original game. Billy and Jimmy Lee are unabashedly bro, and they wear that distinction with style. They dole out manly high fives, shout outdated catchphrases like they mean them ('Tubular!'), and wear skin-tight T-shirts that accentuate their PED-defined abs. When Jimmy smacks a goon with a baseball bat, he shouts 'Touchdown!' without the slightest hint of irony. Neon is consistently funny and doesn't shy away from crazy situations. From a helicopter that hovers upside down, to the weaker enemies referred to as 'cartwheeling cannon fodder,' Neon is happy to make fun of itself.  Double Dragon Neon is a good update to the arcade classic precisely because it's not handcuffed to what the original started. By shifting the tone from serious to crazy and making the combat system rewarding for the most dedicated players, this is a beat-'em-up that fits alongside modern games. The downsides are noticeable. Grinding turns even the brightest games dull, and local-only co-op means you have to invite your friends to your house rather than partake in online shenanigans. But for the few hours it takes to reach the end, Neon is a satisfying brawler that's as deep as it is humorous. Double Dragon Neon doesn't quite live up to its prestigious heritage, but it's a well-made game nonetheless.  Did you enjoy this review?  THE GOOD  Goofy atmosphere with amusing jokes  Defensive mechanics reward skilled players  Passive and special abilities allow for smart customization  THE BAD  Tedious grinding in harder difficulties  8/10",

            "review_text": "An interesting little game. The rather goofy, 'totally radical' general aesthetic and Saturday morning cartoon plot (not that I mind these things much) belies an actually quite sophisticated, if also slightly unintuitive, set of fighting mechanics. Compared to the fast paced arcade beat 'em ups of Capcom and Konami days of yore, Double Dragon Neon is much slower and more deliberate in its approach, with slower attack animations and what has to be the largest input buffer of any fighting game I've ever played.   To explain what I mean: An input buffer is a mechanic, usually seen in vs. fighting games, where the game allows you to enter the input for your next move within a certain window of frames before it's actually ready to come out, instead 'buffering' it to automatically be used on the first available active frame. The Virtua Fighter series is well-known for this mechanic, using the buffer to make the game less 'execution-heavy' by giving you some breathing room to make your inputs rather than require frame-perfect timing. Double Dragon: Neon also uses an input buffer, but at something in the area of 30 frames, half a second when running at 60 FPS, this buffer is positively cavernous by fighting game standards. This severely punishes button-mashing playstyles typical of the genre, as you'll often keep throwing out attacks after you wanted to stop due to this, which conspires with the generally slow pace of moves to make it easy for enemies to counter you, and forces you to be careful in committing to any particular action.   This can make the game feel sluggish and unresponsive, but with some pacing allows for near-effortless dialing in of some rather deep combos, something not typically associated with beat 'em ups. This melds well with the evasion/gleam mechanic of the game, ensuring you can readily dish out highly damaging combos without worrying about precise execution thereof, and even adds some strategy to larger fights, such as using enemies that are easier to gleam off of to give you extra attack power for a combo against harder opponents like Abobos. Enemies and stages in general are also well-designed around this slower paced system, and it rarely feels like you're put into situations that require more maneuverability than what the game allows for as long as you aren't mashing buttons recklessly. If I could have added anything, it probably would have been more aerial combo potential, as there's one jetpack-equipped enemy (Roxy) which I felt the system didn't have enough viable moves against. Speeding up the pace of combat and reducing the input buffer might also have been nice to make the game more friendly to button-mashers, but isn't as big a deal relative to that.  As a rather straightforward game beyond that with only 10 levels there isn't too much else to say. The mixtape system has some customization potential, but feels a bit grindy at times, and generally speaking once you max out your preferred tapes there isn't much of a reason to switch. The soundtrack is pretty spectacular, especially its original songs, but that's going to depend on how much you like 80s throwbacks. One place I would fault Double Dragon: Neon in particular though, is its netcode. I've only had a few connectivity issues with it, but the bigger issue is that the second player experiences the game with a large amount of input lag even in optimal conditions, making it a lot harder to play the online multiplayer as player 2. I usually let my friends host the game so that they don't have to put up with that, but there really isn't a good excuse for it to have been this bad.  All in all, Double Dragon: Neon blends a very strong, if also rather subjective, audio-visual aesthetic with some actually rather deep fighting mechanics for the beat 'em up genre. It feels rough at times, but also very deliberate, requiring more thinking ahead and anticipation reminiscent of vs. fighters rather than the classically more straightforward arcade beat 'em ups of yesteryear. While bad netcode for online multiplayer is a let-down, the game isn't so hard as to make it unplayable, so I'm willing to overlook this flaw for the price. Fans of the genre's younger days may be disappointed by the reduced capacity for mindless fun, but for those who find the throwback aesthetic charming and are interested in the idea of a thinking man's beat 'em up, Double Dragon: Neon is worth the buy.",

I forget what stage # it was, maybe 8...? But it was the stage where after Billy and Jimmy ride down a long slide in a plant creature's lower jaw, they land in a graveyard-type area and fight undead characters. I had to return to the map and restart the stage, and the problem never occurred again. There was also some brief choppiness on some stages, but only lasted for a second or two.

            "review_text": "Double Dragon wasn't a game that needed revisiting. It's an old classic that, while time hasn't been kind toward (slowdowns are almost unbearable in the original), it's still highly regarded and considered a classic in the genre. The game has been released on a wide variety of systems, and even saw a faithful arcade port released to the XBox Live Arcade (slowdowns fixed). In other words, you've had every opportunity to own this game in some form or another.  When I first saw screenshotse for Double Dragon Neon, I immediately cringed and thought of the abomination that was Turtles in Time Reshelled. Upon firing it up, it was a relief that graphics were the only thing it had in common. Double Dragon Neon is a fun take on the series, with the 80s style turned up to 11 and an engine that actually makes it enjoyable to play. It's nothing ground-breaking, but it's still A LOT of fun to play.  You have a system that revolves around mixtapes, which grant you a boost to certain stats (such as power, defense, magic, etc), or allow your character to use special abilities, such as throwing fireballs, healing, or summoning dragons to crush every enemy on screen. You level up your mixtapes by collecting any that fall from enemies, or you can purchase them in store with money you collect from enemies. Once you max out your mixtape, you will want to visit a tapesmith to upgrade how many you can hold, which will further develop your stats.  And you'll need it. The game, while not terribly difficult, can be unforgiving for players wishing to play it like the 1980s classic and just mash out buttons. You have new abilities, such as duck, dodge, and rolling that you MUST learn to use in order to evade enemies and set yourself up to kill them without being hit. If you successfully dodge an attack, your character will gleam, which grants a bonus to your attack. Learning how each enemy attacks and what the best method of disposing of them keeps the game fresh, and fun. You may want to switch your mixtape stance to offer more defense in a particular area, or you may want to boost your magic to fight at a distance. Half the fun is figuring everything out and grinding to upgrade your stats (although non-RPG fans may not find the latter very fun).  Is Double Dragon Neon the best in the series? I think so (although the GBA versions are very good). Is it ground-breaking like the original? Not so much. But it's fun. Grab a friend for even more craziness.  8/10",

My biggest complaint were the controls; there are too many buttons for a beat-em-up, controller compatibility is grim (use JoyToKey to get around this), and the controls cannot be remapped. Worst of all, some buttons (M for magic) are awkwardly spaced away from the other buttons. Even with JoyToKey and a working gamepad, the controls are rather stiff and allow enemies to get in some cheap hits. On the positive side, the game does have a good soundtrack, and the humor is a nice touch as well.",

For the first few levels, I was treated to some pretty decent beat-em-up action that really reminded me of the original Double Dragon. The music is very 80's, the models work well with the artstyle, and the quips and general voiceover are great. The entire game has a great theme going on that certainly promotes the idea of 'Neon'.  There's some pretty interesting brawling mechanics, too, such as a sort of counter-attack system called gleam. It's certainly one of the most redeming parts of this game, and clealy raises the skill ceiling.  Only about 6 stages in, I started having issues. Hit detection technology has not advanced since the original release of Double Dragon in 1987; I often found myself standing inside enemies, mashing the attack button, only to watch my punches pass straight through.   Furthermore, there is a certain boss with a platforming mechanic that proves to be extremely frustrating and not fun (to the point where I decided to stop playing). The game's mechanics, while solid, are not at all conductive to platformer gameplay. There's about a half second of animation before your character starts running, for example, making timed jumps pretty difficult to make consitantly.   At the end of the day, though, Neon is an OK game. I wish I could give this game a neutral recommendation, but it's at least passable in my eyes.",

The art style, music, and other elements are heavily inspired by the decade that brought us the original game. One special move called the 'Bro-Dozer' has a theme tune reminiscent of Kylie Minogue's cover of 'The Locomotion'. The voice of the game's main villain closely resembles that of Skeletor from Filmation's animated MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE series. The game even pokes fun at the concept of the 'load-bearing boss'.  Nostalgia aside, the game is fun, if a bit challenging. Special moves and abilities can be acquired by collecting 'mixtapes' (another nod to 80s music culture). Collecting extras of a given tape increase the power of that special move/ability. After several plays, you'll become powerful enough to beat the first boss and collect chunks of 'Mithril', an ore that allows further upgrades of mixtape abilities. This means that a little bit of backtracking and level grinding is needed to power up enough to survive the final battle. Given the low price of the game and the humorous trip down memory lane it provides, it's worth a try.",

Went into the local files, switched to integrated graphics instead of Nvidia and the game works like a charm, no crashing at all. And I'm running Windows 10 too with no issues.   Probably one of the best games in my library, no joke, just under Double Dragon Trilogy. A great soundtrack for anyone who likes 80s music and easy to rock along with as you beat Williams and Abobo to a pulp. My only complaint is they didn't bring back Roper, except as a secret stage in the lab. Hit detection is fine for me, pace of the game flows with a proper beat em up and difficult enough to provide a challenge without being too hard.

Unfortunately, it was too true to the old quarter grabbing arcade systems, in that the difficulty curb was extremely unforgiving and a bit sadistic. It is too bad, as the humor was great and I would have loved to see it through without having to watch a Youtube walkthrough to do so. I got stuck after chasing the 'Skeletor' type villian into space and then coming back to earth. After that level, the difficulty is crazy hard to make it to a save point.  Even with playing less than half of the levels in the game, I still enjoyed what I did play. In the 21st century, it is really hard to find people willing to grind over the same level over and over for hours in utter frustration. Unless procedurally generated levels/worlds is in effect, and a lot of variety, most modern gamers just won't put up with this retro-style game.",
