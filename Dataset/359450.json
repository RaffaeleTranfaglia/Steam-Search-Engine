            "review_text": "Local multiplayer games are so hard to find, but finally here is one which brings MADNESS and FRENZINESS to parties with friends. Fast paced matches, funny game dynamics, many and many ships/weapons/arenas to choose: perfect match to humiliate in 1001 ways your buddies!  Personally I fell in love with the combo Striker + Quantic Slinger, with which you can launch wandering asteroids and create chaos in the arena. Who need the rules? WOO-HOOOOO!!! I think this game isn't designed for online multiplaying, and the single-mode with the 'bustard' bots is enjoyable, but not as the human one.  A friend's advise? Take your combination or a random one, and play it BETTING with your friends! And don't forget to try all the voice packs! :D",

            "review_text": "  XInput only. For a local 4 co-op only game. Yes, absolutely correct - the 4 players will all have xbox 360 gamepad. (nowhere on the store page it's says 'xbox 360 gamepad only'. Just 'full support' or whatever. If you know what that means please call me.) You with a keyboard and 3 bots.  Very  co-op.    No way to turn off the garbage that's flying around. Controlling the ship is ALREADY challenging, and with debris flying around you have to focus on it just to stay alive and keep shooting around hoping that you will hit something.    Zero options for any map to begin with. 8 total maps. Each one slightly different. In color and some details. Like 1 map has asteroids flying around, the other one has that AND a black hole flying around, slightly draging you there. That's it. Yes, it's 'interesting' but it just adds more garbage to dodge. The sole thing you would actually wish for is an option to turn ALL of that off, so that each of you could shoot each other. And actually play a game and not just dodge the space debris.  Perfectly, there should be  at least basic  options for each map - debris: on/off. Buffs: on/off. Wind: on/off. Warped space: on/off. But instead you just choose  'Location'  - which is the choise of a map itself, like 'Galaxy Core' (which is near sun, because the sun is the center of a galaxy, yes) - which just changes the theme of a map, in this case a map being 'Sun thematic'. And then you choose from  3 sizes of that map , so called 'Alfa sector', 'Beta sector', 'Gamma sector'.     Controls are bad. Yes, they are 'simple to use' -&gt; wasd (and should be D-pad or left stick on a gamepad) to move in 4 directions, but it just lacks control and precicion. You press 'A' (left) - the ship starts to fly left  in a curve . Whether fast ship or slow (like 'jugernaut') - makes little help here, because with the controls designed like this - dodging the space debris is very difficult. (not  challenging  but  difficult  because of a bad controls choise). IMO this game could benefit controls mechanic from LUFTRAUSERS, or at least it could be an option.     Voice actors should be fired... from a cannon. In options you can select 'Voice pack' which will make that voice 'yours' -&gt; when someone from your enemys dies - 'you' will say something. 90% of those voices ('voice packs') are just stupid and annoying, and treat you like a 12 years old. (The only one that was bearable for me was voice 'SZ 83-5'). And why the heck would you even implement a voice lines in such a broken game? There's so many horrible gameplay decisions made, - many things to actually  improve  and yet to stuff pointless voices in a game... When you respawn after being killed - you will have a hard time trying to figure out where you are, and someone saying something poitnless and annoying in a background is  not  helpful.    In Space We Float.  Desperately trying to dodge all that crap that's flying in our faces. Also, the xbox 360 gamepad is the only gamepad in the universe.  I actually refunded 1,79â‚¬. At least fix first two cons that I mentioned above -  then  this game will be worth something. Perfectly, all of the mentioned above. And then there will be more people that buy and recommend this game.",
