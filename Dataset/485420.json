During the short time that I spent in the game, I killed a poacher, almost fell into the trap, and died of thirst: D The only drawback of this game - bugs. They are quite a lot - I walked through the trees, fell through the texture. But all the same game fun and I liked!  7/10, will watch for updates!",
