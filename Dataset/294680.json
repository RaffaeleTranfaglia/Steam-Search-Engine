Another Personal Favorite game of mine in which you help Putt-Putt get ready for the Cartown 500 Big Race by finding by finding Extra High Powered High Octane Gasoline, a Safety Helmet for Pep, a Triangular Racing Flag with the Racing Number on it &amp; Earning Money for a Carwash/New Paint Job/Super Speed Radial Racing Tires.  And Remember: It's not if you Win or Lose, it's how you race around the Track.",

            "review_text": "The nostalgia is strong with this one. To be fair it's probably the most all-around competent of the series thus far. Not so much randomization but at least there are entirely alternate quests/objectives. The minigames are also actually put into the plot for once instead of being diversions, and they're not awful so it doesn't detract or anything. The game world is again pretty big all things considered (for this kind of game, basically) and it's decent fun and certainly good nostalgia. Don't know what more to say.",

If you like point-and-click adventure games, have a kid between the agest of 3 and 8 (although some kids might want to play this all hte way up to 10 or maybe 12), or have played this game in your childhood, you NEED this game.",
