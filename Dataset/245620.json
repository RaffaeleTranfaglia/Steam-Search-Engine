The content is filled with little jokes and puns and things to make you chuckle (or groan!) and the game is certainly challenging on the higher settings. I play the lower ones and am challenged quite enough, thanks! I have really enjoyed the DLC, which is on sale often enough to make it affordable for even my tiny budget. One of the things I enjoy most about the game, is the replay value! I can use the 'sandbox' setting to play any goal, a known or randomly generated map, and with any level of difficulty. Add some of the DLC expansion packs, and honestly it keeps me quite busy whenever I wish to play. Challenging, without being Frustrating, and replayable without being stuck with only select missions. Fun Stuff for the price!",

            "review_text": "I'm recommending this game for one reason: Multiplayer  Tropico 5 nailed the multiplayer aspect. Being able to play alongside my friends is the reason I love this game. It's the best multiplayer city building game out there. I have not come across any other like this. Tropico 5 lets you build next to players or with them. Cooperative or Competive, whichever you prefer. SimCity can hardly compete since you don't build together, you build in seperate regions.  Cities: Skylines is the best city building game on the market hands down, but no multiplayer.  During a multiplayer game you can share money, roads, utilities and military forces. It's very satisfying to share the love of these games alongside people who also love it. There are a lot of hilarious moments, especially if you're playing with friends. The rebels have basically become a meme among my friends because they're idiotic and easy to joke about. The only downside is being forced to send backup when a friend is attacked. If you get attacked while your troops are in a friend's city, all you can do is pray. Also, mandate is bs.  The game could give all the mandate to one player but not the other. Don't even get me started on roads. Roads suck. They're horrible.  The multiplayer is great and I hope it sets the foundation for future games. The dream would be this multiplayer on Tropico 4, Cities: Skylines or SimCity.  I personally feel like it still capted the same feel as Tropico 4, except it was watered down and made much more difficult. You will never truly defeat the rebels or please everyone, this game is best played as a warmongering oppressive dictatorship. It will give you the most satisfaction since your prize is blood and trust me, there's plenty so you might as well enjoy it.  TLDR: Multiplayer mechanics are great, game is a downgrade, still enjoyable.  Advice: Spam sugar plantations and rum distillaries.",

Every detail is thought through, and the game manages to keep you on your toes and interested as it progresses through such a long time period. You start in the Colonial Era, which gives you the building blocks on which your city will later stand. You then progress to the WW Era, where you are confronted with a new task of keeping up relations with the Allies and the Axis, or to avoid diplomacy and go down the route of a dictatorship! The next is perhaps the biggest transition, from the WW Era to the Cold War. You are, again, confronted with the two powers of USA and USSR. You experience new cultures such as tourism, industrialism and many more new features. You then move on to Modern Times, where you are put in the 'sandbox' mode and are left to enjoy the rest of the game!  Another great thing are the characters! You get Penultimo and Lord Oaksworth mostly, whos speeches are always a welcome surprise. They give you quests and tips, and notify you when anything happens. There are many more as you progress, each with their own distinct voice and interesting script.  I give this game 9/10!",

Of course you have to build and reach your objectives as usual but in Tropico 5 you have more options than before. From customizing your El Presidente, hiring manager to your building, finding technology and much more. Using the tutorial is actually a good idea to be honest.  But do not worry; you can actually set the level of difficulty easily.  Visually, this game is beautiful and run smoothly. The soundtrack is a pleasure to your ears as we would expect from this franchise.   My only criticism is with the control, I am wondering why the gamepad is the primary control. To me this type of game is so much better with your keyboard and mouse. Saying this, you can play with the keyboard and mouse but it is not smooth in my opinion.  Positives: ~~~~~~~ - Visually splendid - Fantastic soundtracks - Plenty things to do - Setup your levels of difficulties (political, economic, etc) before you start each mission - Challenging - Achievements - Trading cards  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~  - Gamepad as primary control  Overall this game is a solid 8 out of 10 (just because of the gamepad), Otherwise I would give it a 10 out of 10.  Well done El Presidente!    MORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE      FOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE  ",

I personally dont think so i clocked a whopping 140 hours into tropico 4 to beat it and all of its dlc missions tropico 5 only a mere 20 hours and by no means am i the best tropico player out there   Why you giving it a thumbs down? The games kind of dry it adds some stuff removes some stuff its an apple to oranges comparison to this and tropico 4 cant directly compare cause there different enough this game just feels like it has a massive lack of content and customization however it is fun though  overall: wait for a steam sale for the complete bundle with all dlc it will be worth every penny then and please dont play this game vanilla ether you will cry yourself to sleep at night i literally opened the game when i had it vanilla and said this is it? :P",

The mechanics and graphics are smooth and to a high quality, and the replayability is of course high for a game of this calibre. Whilst I have yet to successfully complete a sandbox game without utter chaos and uprisings against my dictatorships, trying a new approach everytime will allow me to spend countless more hours in this game. 9/10, definately recommend for any RTS / City Sim fan.",

            "review_text": "I was hesitant to buy this game at first because of the reviews but I went ahead and got it anyway because it was on sale and I love the Tropico franchise. This is now my favorite tropico so far.  This game got me just as hooked as the others, and hands down it is the most in-depth and complex tropico so far.  They have introduced dynasties so you can have additonal characters and vote other dynasty members in during elections and take advantage of their bonuses. Moving the character around to give boosts to buildings has been eliminated. I see this as a good thing because it just seemed like unecessary micromanagement in the previous game. Instead your character or dynasty members give global boosts to production or whatever else they do (military strength, effectiveness of services, etc.)  They have also overhauled trading and added trade routes which can be very profitable if you find good opportunites (Not every trade is profitable and sometimes settling for less lucrative ones is desirable.) They are very easy to manage and not annoying at all. Docks are now more useful to provide more ships for trade routes.  The difficulty of the game has gone up, which is a good thing for me because in previous installments I'd get bored when I had loads of cash and almost 100% happiness. In this game I've actually had to use my military AND do the voter fraud thing. I had never had to do that in previous games. You no longer need a secret service building to do certain things, which I thought was pretty annoying.  They've introduced a constitution which give you decisions to make that will benefit your country. There is no more immigration building but the benefits provided by one are instead on a constitutional amendment. Edicts are basically the same but some have to be unlocked through research. They've also added research, and it's not just buying blueprints like before. Building libraries and staffing them give research points.  Armies and military are very important now and are to be utilized. In previous games I would not bother with militaries until the militant faction complained, in this game it is very handy to have a sizable military, especially when declaring independence in the colonial era.  There are now multiple eras in the game. I did not have the modern times expansion from Tropico 4 so I will not compare them directly, but the eras add a whole new interesting layer. In the colonial era you should try to increase revolutionary support to buy independence from the crown and move on to the great war era. This is where the military can also come in handy, to declare independence the crown requests $20,000. If you have a sizable military you can refuse and fight off the crowns troops to save that money. It's not extremely difficult to do and is somewhat challenging but it was a lot of fun for me to do.  Farms and mines are also much different. Farms are much more asthetically pleasing and larger. The way building upgrades work has also been changed and is more relevant early game. It's not just a statistical advantage to get late game anymore. A previous reviewer has complained about the way the mine looks, but I think it looks much much better than before. Instead of a random patch of land being dug into, mines are now in preselected locations along mountains.   Wages &amp; rents are more simple to manage, no longer do you set individual rents or wages but you set budgets which determine worker prosperity. I do not think I can explain it well, but if you set budgets high, the workers income level becomes either poor, well-off, rich, etc. This determines what kind of house they live in.  There is now a 'fog of war' type mechanic on the island. In the colonial and great war era you need to explore your island to reveal what resources you have available. You use your military for this.  The game runs just as well, if not better, than the previous version of Tropico. I honestly think it runs better than Tropico 4 did on my laptop which is surprising. I also feel comfortable hooking the laptop up to the TV and playing this tropico from my couch with my wireless laptop &amp; keyboard. The GUI had been changed and is much better. I also like that they changed the portraits on the message screens. It's not as exaggerated and cartoony as it was before. I also feel like I can't zoom in on my island as far as I used to.   Cons: Only bad things I think is that there is no real additional building sprites. I thought this would be something easy to do. The almanac also has a little less info available but the data that it does show is much more useful and better organized than before.  I highly recommend it for anybody who likes the Tropico series. I have been playing since Tropico 2 and this one is my favorite so far. Definitely buy, even at full price.",

It ceratinly adds to Tropico 4 although doesn't take the concept any further than its simple formula.  What I like:  -The new buildings and a co-op mode that you can play with your friends, saying that the co-op could be better designed. The new buildings include one that gives you tanks and other jet bombers, so that's pretty cool.  -The new factions that change through the time periods. This keeps the game interseting as you have to choose a faction you would like to keep on good grounds.  -The trade system. I like this because I can choose trade routhes that suit me if I want to sell a specific resource at a certain time that I have an adundance of.  What I dislike:  -The dynasty system and the overall avatar creation. There are like 4 uniforms and the dynasty feels kind of out of place as they never really change. I thought it would add an effect where each dynasty member would stand for a differnet thing in the eyes if the people and that you could replace one dynasty with an other but instead it is just a set of different leaders.  - It could be just me but the AI feel a little worse than on Tropico 4, they feel like they have no agency.  Overall I would suggest for people who want a new Tropico, but if you are looking for this kind of game with all the things it brings I may still suggest it but I would also equally recommend Tropico 4 with all expansion.  I would give it a 7.5 out of 10 as it doesn't feel very fresh compared to 4. ",

It is by far the most interesting and tedious city builder there is to date which covers a lot of ground to keep you busy and reeled in for hours on end.  There are only two major complaints I still have about this game - read why below.  1 - The Multiplayer was horrible at first and because of that the game got a really bad wrap from the get go so players stopped playing it online due to the issues it originally had. On a positive note most of those problems were fixed and it does work very well online now. However, due to that bad start it may be hard to play it online unless you go to the community or get a friend to join you.  2 - One of my biggest problems that I have always had with this game with each of it's following game sequences is that the buildings are way too repetitive as in all of the building types are the exact same. So once you get further into the game you'll notice that you have lots of areas with houses and buildings but they all look exactly alike with absolutely no variance whatsoever. I have repeatedly complained to them about this in every series and nothing has been done and I doubt now that it will ever change either unless a ton of people start to do the same. One thing though that does make it a little better is the different building types and the added buildings from the dlc but still if you have a bunch of houses and similar buildings you will notice that and it may become an annoyance. If you can look past that then you'll enjoy it! On top of that the Eras also do help aid with that in changing the look of several types of buildings after upgrades have occurred from advancing in time but many do not such as housing unfortunately.  Anyhow though, aside from those two issues it is still an epic game and I definitely think it's worth the price in full but if you'd rather wait for a sale then I would certainly recommend grabbing it for sure to say the least!",

Positives: +Multi-Player +More being a Dictator / ♥♥♥♥ +More Tropico +Grid system +Eras +More Story like Sandbox games (They were the best part any way)  Negatives: -Ruined the paying system (Makes it impossible to make my Communist utopia as I have literally no idea how much I am paying people and if they can even afford houses) -Multilayer whilst fun is not to easy to work together on and an all for one system would be nice (You know like 2 people can work on one nation) -DLC Whilst a lot of it is nice to have it is overly expensive for stuff that could have been patched in / should have been in any way as well as most of it could have been mods but £2.56 / $4.00 is a bit much if it was more like £1 / $2.50 then it would be a lot better and for bigger DLC I feel that £15 / $25 is fair but more content should be added for how much you pay -I WANT MY DAMN PAY SLIDERS  Overall I really love the game but that’s more or less the theme and the series I just love the series so it is a shame the DLC that I want so badly is to expensive however the base game is still amazing so I would recommend it or maybe pick up Tropico 4 / 3 first to get a grip of it first.",

But not everything is perfect in Tropico 5.  The campaign was a bit short for my taste (took me around 8 hours) and it was pretty easy. (played on Medium Settings) Your mileage may vary!  They overhauled many of the mechanics and systems in the game and introduced a new 'era' system, where you start as a colony of the crown in the early 20th century and then need to fight for your independence to advance to the World War era. After that, it's the Cold War era and then the Modern Times era. Each era unlocks new buildings, new upgrades, new possibilities and new political factions and potential invaders. You also need to research stuff and edicts before being able to use them (reminiscent of one of the 'Extra Missions' in Tropico 4) This gives Tropico 5 a sense of progression that was absent in the previous entries - which is a good thing.  However, I think all these changes in the pacing and the mechanics are one of the reasons, why they played it 'safe' in the buildings department. While the new gameplay systems offer many new things to Tropico veterans, the buildings are mostly the same as in previous iterations... and there are less buildings as in Tropico 4.  The game features all of the usual buildings and infrastructure (houses, roads, Teamster office, factories, military buildings etc.) but it lacks some 'eyecatchers' and special buildings like the Golden Statue or the Eternal Flame in Tropico 4. Even the tourist buildings are a bit bland compared to the previous games - and there are no more 'tourist attractions', just hotels/lodgings and some general 'entertainment' buildings like the Casino or a Restaurant. No more Balloon Rides or Ferry Wheels or Ethnic Enclaves ... the only 'real' attractions are the new hover gliders and a circus. The rest is - as mentioned - usual 'city' stuff like the Casino, a Museum, an Opera etc.  Other examples of 'absent' structures: Weather Station, Radio Station (TV and newspaper are still there), Grade School (High scool and College are still there), Radar Dishes ... Also, there are no more foreign army bases, no more Aid Tents, no more Stock Markets or other 'special' structures with various effects or consequences.  Some buildings now have two functions: the Police Station can now be upgraded so that it is also a Fire Brigade. There is no dedicated Fire Bridage building.  But this does not mean that you cannot build beautiful and diverse cities in Tropico 5! You absolutely can build great cities! But in my opinion, even with the progressive era system, you will see every available building way to soon... especially since you'll know 95% of them if you played Tropico 3 or 4.  The game is however as addicting as the previous entries in the series. The Sandbox Mode will provide me with many more hours of entertainment and achievement hunting. (already played the game for 25 hours at the time of writing this review) They also added a Multiplayer Mode, which is fun but - at the time of writing - very buggy. You can play Versus and Coop and you can set your own winning conditions like 'first one to get 1 Million in Cash' or 'First one to build a Nuclear Rocket' etc.  Even though this review might sound negative, I absolutely recommend this game! The graphics are great, the gameplay is a lot of fun and addicting, the music is still awesome (I liked some tracks in Tropico 4 better, but that may be a matter of taste) and the humor is still there (even though I find the game to be somewhat less cheerful / over the top than Tropico 4)!  I'm looking forward to play many more hours of Tropico 5 in Multiplayer and Sandbox Mode and I'm also looking forward to coming DLC or Add-Ons! There's hope that they will re-introduce some of the 'over the top' stuff of Tropico 4: Modern Times.  Is Tropico 5 a better game than Tropico 4? In many aspects: yes. In some other aspects, it's not. The Tropico series always played it safe and so Tropico 5 is more of an evolution than a revolution. But maybe 'more of the same old' is actually not that bad. Try to change a formula too much and you end up with a mess. Do I have to mention SimCity here or did you get it right away? ;) (but I have to admit: I like the new SimCity, even with all its problems!)   If you played Tropico 3/4: Tropico 5 is a very, very good game but it won't surprise you much, as it is 'more of the same' with better graphics and a new progression system. Still, it is very good!  If you never played a Tropico game (or only the 2D versions): you'll be in for a treat!  In this genre, there aren't many competitors that are as good as Tropico 5! So grab your copy now ... or else!!!  Viva Tropico!",

This time that downward trend is taking a huge step, and the specialness of idea is really watered down to just another citybuilder.   Also the gameplay itself is really dumbed down, the noble goal seems to be reducing micromanagement, but it actually fails in that by giving away badly functioning building budgets, while taking away esential tools to efficient city-running. (Rent selector anyone?) Almanac, your primary source of information is also infinitely worse than its predecessor.  Some design choises like removal of essential buildings (jail?) or lack of missions points really obviously towards truckload of DLC coming up. There are lots of complaints about bugs, and i did experience teamsters jamming and sound glitches.   Seems to be that devs are running out of ides, or more likely the businessmen don't let them be used anymore. I guess it is the sad fate of every succesful game. No risks are allowed, everything potentially offensive is removed and for the sake of larger audience, everything is 'simplified'. Result is tasteless, bland and just riding on tales of glorious past.  If you get a steam special discount bundle with DLC included, it is worth it. For full price, definitely not. Already tropico 2 was better as game, and part 3 or its full-price expansion 4 is way better as story.",

The soundtrack doesn't have nearly the oomph that Tropico 4 did, I find myself muting it and going back to the 3rd and 4th soundtracks to keep the vibe.  Thankfully, glitches aren't as abundant as they were in past games, but when they happen, they break a game you worked hours on. Mod support is okay, it's only as good as the community making the mods, and right now it's definitely not as large as other communities like Fallout and Prison Architect.  All-in-all, this is a good vanilla gaming experience. Multiplayer is fun, and if this is your first Tropico game, you won't be set up for disappointment.

Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

And most of them will have at least tried one of the prequels, and yes to use a rather obvious cop out, if you liked them, then you will like this. If you didn't, the you won't.  The question really becomes, is there enough new material to jutify shelling out for, what is really, the same bloody game all over gain. Are Kalypso simply doing a FIFA and gouging their fanbase?  Well the single player campaign is a not unlikeable mix of pop culture and zeitgeist meme pastiches which holds together more effectively than the sort of rubbish that strategy games typically breach trading standard regulations by calling a 'story'. There is a not so subtle difference from previous games where instead of being installed on a new island for each 'level', you select between two different islands and every decision you make will carry over throughout the story.  Its an interesting dynamic, making you consider carefully each and every decision, though it can make subsequent levels really easy, or really hard, depending on how you performed throughout the story. Liberally dot guard towers around the island, and the 'Island Invasion' level (erm spoiler?!?) becomes a cakewalk,tank your ecconomy in the first level and you maywell be struggling for the rest of the game, or at least until the next island section is unlocked.  However the 'campaign' is short. A lot shorter than previous games, with a literal handful of islands to play on and a run time of maybe 15 hours. This sort of playtime is pretty much a given now for a FPS campaign, but strategy gamers tend to expect a bit more.  That said, there is still the sandbox mode, which will generate an infinite number of islands to continue your thirst for megalomania upon. The main substance of the game, the actual building, has been much improved in a variety of ways. Farms now show exactly how much space they will actually farm, and whilst you can still build on their land, this will have a subsequent impact on their production levels. It does make it much easier to judge exactly how close to the sugar plantation you can build the bunkhouse for its workers.  You can also assign managers from the general population to buff most buildings, increasing productivity, or happiness or even the standard of localhousing for example. Buildings can also be upgraded as time progresses increasing the customisation options available to you. And indeed time does now march on, with options only being unlocked once a certain timeframe has been reached.  Trade is also greatly improved, no longer reliant on simply shipping goods off the island, you can build a fleet of trade ships to export specific goods at inflated prices, or turn your island into a modern day Japan, importing cheap raw resources and processing them into more lucrative luxery goods for export.  The big draw that Kalypso has made a big thing of is the 'dynasty' system, which I cannot help but think of as an attempt to tap into the cult status of Crusader Kings. Unfortunately its the weakest new adition and really a bit of an abject failure. The characters in your dynasty simply exist to give you an alternative character to play as.   They don't age, or die, they don't enact their own plans to overthrow your rule, or assasinate their older siblings in order to inherit the presidency (eh? Presidency is inherited, just ask the Bush's!).   Its a bit like Nick Clegg.  They don't really do anything, they are just there.  Still, you are free to completely ignore them.   So thats alright then.  Tropico 5 is certainly a good game, I'd go so far as to say one of the best city builders currently available, and certainly the best entry in the franchise. If you haven't played the franchise since the second game, then its an easy recommend (provided you liked it. NATCH).   BUT  Even with the new additions, it really is just tinkering around the edges. It looks the same and plays the same as 4, and with the reuse of many building models and music remaining unchanged since the third game, a convincing argument could be made that you already paid for the game.   Twice.  It also seems to have been released with fewer building choices than either three or four, and theories of a DLC gouging plan cannot really be dismissed out of hand as the paranoid ramblings of deranged conspiracy theorists.   Now if you will excuse me, whilst my body may well be freezing its extremities off, at least my mind can be whisked away to, well if not a tropical paradise, a close approximation of.

It offers both 'campaign' mode with guided missions, and 'sandbox' mode with endless play where you choose the parameters. It also has the added play element of how corrupt to be, whereas in similar games you are apparently the Angel Mayor.  Furthermore, it has excellent DLC at reasonable prices, but plays just fine without that (unlike a couple games I could name).

It's more challanging and less repeatable than Tropico 4's.   Been really addicted to Tropico 5 for the last few days and lost serveral times beating by uprising angry mobs because I banished crime lords too often, or invaded by Nazi or Allies because export prices were raised too high...  And always remember to kill those filthy rebels rentlessly and build guard towers like what your did in Red Alert!  ----------  不扯太多，虽然我之前一直把海岛大亨系列叫做独裁模拟器，但对于海岛大亨5来说，这是目前最好玩的 社会主义模拟器 ，沙盒模式可玩性相当高。  之前一直觉得海岛5没有海岛4好，因为战役是4更好玩，以前的Penultimo更有趣、TNT Radio更“新闻联播”、可以造移民局（相信大家都很理解川普的心情-_-）等等。  但最近几天最难条件下玩了几盘沙盒（其中因为放逐犯罪分子太狠被刁民们推翻了N次，出口商品卖高价导致外交恶化被国外势力推翻了N次），终于体会到海岛5这种整合海岛4资料片高科技时代模式的乐趣了。另外，无论何时，对付刁民一定要狠，防御塔一定要像红警那样造！",

Most of these have to do with having several of the same types of building right beside the other. There is a patch in the works beyond the current 1.01 as posted today in the Kalypso forums. Other problems the military is dumb as bricks, you have no control over it. But since invasions always happen at your docks you can cluster some military buildings there and solve the 'military runs to building slated to be under attack.' This also helps with the military runs around the block and doesn't stand and fight problem.  Now to the game itself, pop culture humor? Check. New faces and old faces from the previous games? Check. Dictator style answers to problems including gunning down protestors? Check. Banishing, killing, discrediting and bribing? Check on all of those. The consitution system makes it more interesting as well, unlike with Tropico 4 where you could simply pour people in via a immigration office.   Will you enjoy it? Most likely. If you can get it on sale from your favorite game shop whether it's ♥♥♥, GMG, or the steam store buy it. I'm running around 40 hours so far and for the $29 I paid, you can't beat that deal.",

            "review_text": "Whilst officially a sequal to the Tropico franchise, the game iteslf feels at times more like a reboot with the amount of changes made. Nonetheless, all changes made feel for the better and while the game istself is not without bugs as of launch, it seems to run fine overall.   The dynasty system is well implemented and gives an incentive for multiple playthroughs . The fact that your fully upgraded dynasty can be used in multiplayer matches helps add an interesting, even competetive dynamic to things. Though multiplayer itself could use a bit of polish (but, as it is the first time it has been implemented in the franchise, it gets a pass).   Military units and buildings have been changed significantly, as have the way battles work. Your military units are no longer simply all the soldiers on your island, but a select number of 'squads' whose numbers and types are based on the functioning military building on the island. There is also the added feature of changing targets in battle, leading rebels, uprisings, mutinous soldiers, and even invasion forces (which may now be fought off, albiet only with a strong military) to choose muliple, and differing target during an engagement, eventually leading up to an attack on your palace. However, the introduction of tanks and a Tropican air force allow new methods of handling those who are not staisfied with your benevolent rule.   The singleplayer game is much more challenging and dynamic than in the past, as well as much longer. The eras not only extend the length of the average sandbox game, but also make it so that at no point can you get too comfortable with dealing with economic and political situations (a problem that made prior games quickly become dull). Each era has its own issues to address, but also new ways to address them (and previous problems). For instance, the colonial period is more or less a race against the clock to declare independence before your gubernatorial mandate expires, while the Cold War will see you plunged into a tug-of-war between the US and USSR, with Tropico serving as the rope.  Gone, however, are the humorous election speeches and dozen or so characters that made the humor of the old games stand out. That is not to say that the humor is absent, but don't expect it to not be as omnipresent as in previous titles, as more focus seems to have been put into new mechanics and gameplay, and less on hiring VA's for voicework.   Another issue is the lack of customization options as of launch. The new customization screen for your dynasty allows you to alter the outfits and appearance of your up to seven dynasty members, allowing for greater variety and reflection of whatever imposed personalities you dictate (no pun intended), this even includes cusstomizing the color of said outfits, a completely new customization option from previous games. However, as of launch, there appears to be barely (if even) seven outfit choices for male and female characters. This is gratly disappointing compared to previous titles in the series, which allowed for a variety of possibilites in the look and feel of characters.   Also of note is that while the graphical style of the game has been altered somewhat from Tropico 3 and 4, do not expect too much improvement. Buildings look to be rendered at about the same quality as before, as do the enviornments and characters. This may be because of the scheduled Xbox 360 launch (they had to keep it within the limits of the console most likely). Though one notable improvement graphically is the inclusion of a grid overlay, which makes city planning much easier and more efficident.   All in all, Tropico 5 (or simply 'Tropico,' according to the title screen) is a new direction for the series, with several new feartures added and refined. Yet all these many changes seem to be for the better overall, alowing for a more dynamic and challenging experience whilst still maintaining the overall humor and atmosphere of previous titles. A bit of polish and refinement is needed, but it will most likely be covered in coming patches. It is disappointing that many options for buildings and customization shall likely be held back for DLC purposes, but thus is the way of our times.   I give them game four out of five stars, for its number of (good) changes, but leaving one for the necessity of minor AI fixes and lack of certain promised features (like encountering tribes) and for a significant lack of building types compared to prior titles like Tropico 4 ( a disappointing things for a 'city-builder'). I highly recommend this title for any fans of the Tropico series, and also as a good starting point for those who have yet to play but show interest in the franchise. Overall, a strong entry into this classic series that serves as a breadth of fresh air.   Here's to a New Dawn in Tropico!  Viva El Presidente!  With all respect thusly owed, His Excellency",

It doesn't require a lot of focus like lets say an fps or moba, but it does require you to think politically and economically. For the amount of time I haved played this I enjoy teaming up with people like Germany and Russia in the world wars and cold war since they both support my dictator rule and my citizens don't get mad cause I am a nice one too. Also the multiplayer is fun when you want to work with your fiends (emphasis on work) cause when you want to fight your friends the combat really does embrace the idea of not having to focus on it by just playing out before you and you learn if your defenses are good or bad. So overall I would give this an 9/10 its a fun, relaxing, game.  Edit: Also an amazing fact about this game is that you know how you lose so you won't be mad that you lost, all you will be thinking is 'Well ok I did this and this wrong so I need to fix that the next time I try' and thats all making a perfectly stressless game.",

I'm pretty sure I found the guide, but I do not know if I recieved the DLCs. If you know what the DLCs are, please reply or message me to let me know.  Now for this review: *Game Budget* The price as of this review is about $40. Normally new games are $50, so this game being $40 is a nice change.  *Graphics* The graphics are a slight improvement over Tropico 4, and the character graphics are horriable. Granit, I have to play it in low settings or risk the game lagging out, but Tropico 4 character graphics were not that bad.  *Campagin* The storyline was funny and very SciFi orrentated, but was very short. I beat the campagin in under 10 hours. I might replay the campagin again, but I doubt it. All the missions were very easy, except for one (but that was my fault for trying to export gold too late in the game).  *Music* Unlike the normal Caribbean, this one had more of a techno feel to it. This only added to the SciFi orrented gameplay.  *Buildings* I have noticed that in a lot of reviews, people have talked about the lack of new buildings. I actually disagree. I found there to be a lot of new buildings and new abilities to make your buildings work better (or worst). Even the tourism buildings are diffrent and easier to manage.  *Multiplayer* The main reason I bought this game... and sadly I was a bit disappointed. First off their is no save function in the game. Second off, the game crashes way too much. And lastly, if you play on teams, and you win; your partner does not get the achievements for it. It was a great idea, but much like communism, it failed at the attempt.  In conclusion to my review, I shockingly do recommend Tropico 5, but only on this biest: I am a fan of the Tropico games and plan on owning them all again some day. I do hope the game devolopers improve the game and read the player reviews for I found them to be very helpful.",

What I especially liked in the campaign was the fact that player had to develop more isles over a period of time, which requires more planning and strategy, because consequences of past decisions lead to success or failure in present. Definitve a fun factor for me. As for multiplayer, the players compete to accomplish various goals and whoever has the more points in the end, wins. Players can use armies to attack each other to slow down their progress, but main focus is building and economy. There are more multiplayer modes, but the one mentioned is the best fun. Game speed is swift enough to finish the match in reasonable time.  DLCs are nice addition and come usually with a new map, costume, building, mission related random events and a challenging scenario.

The trumpets sound just a couple steps above one of those Casio keyboards from the 80s/90s. The voice acting is not on par with previous generations. The overlay for resources is not as intuitive, although it does have a nifty little animation as it loads. The UI has switched largely to icons instead of text labels, which made things a little harder to find.  But I recommended this game, right? Sure, it's still a fun game.

Graphics are nice but I have to say I'd like to have multiple models for (for example) houses and such, having every single house looking the same kills a bit realism.

            "review_text": "STOP. If you already own Tropico 4 you probably don't need this game and it will likely frustrate you. I'm writing this review in the days after release so my gameplay time of Tropico 5 has admitedly been limited. That said, I've played the Tropico series since the original back in the early 2000's. I get that changes need to be made to keep the game relevant, but in my opinion Tropico 5 changed largely in the wrong direction. However, if you're new to the series, you'll enjoy this game for what it has to offer. Here's my initial breakdown.  Pros:  Beautifully redesigned buildings, everything just seems to fit together nicely when you're trying to cram a lot of buildings into one space. The dynasty member function seems like a possible plus (haven't really fleshed that out yet). I like the concept of having manager's in buildings, but it's not clear how they contribute to the overall expense of the building. I like some of the new edicts like charging for healthcare! Finally those lazy peasants will pay or die. The addition of tanks adds a layer of badassery and battling rebels/other nations is more engaging.  Cons:  Can't set the exact wage for a worker anymore (it's done in an overarching budget system, so you set a budget for a building which somehow encompasses a salary for the worker and operating costs for the building). You want to pay your farmers more than your doctors? Sorry, can't do that... You also can't set the exact amount for rent anymore. The above two issues make it hard to become an uber-capitalist dictator. I know it sounds ridiculous but they've dumbed down the economic system so much it's actually complicated. Customizing your character is gone. I don't care so much about what they look like, but who thought an astronaut suit should be 1 of the 5 outfits you get to choose? I'm more upset you can't select negative and positive traits to create a more in depth character. I always liked choosing flatulence even though the palace guards got double pay... Am I missing the plants and shrubbery somwhere? You basically have a large park and a small park, that's it. No single palm trees to meticulously line your roadways... Statues meant to glorify El Presidente's and intimidate your opponents are non-existent. You have to pay to explore your island now which seems pointless. Options like 'paper plates' and 'cloth napkins' that used to affect the quality of a restaurant are no longer options. You adjust the budget of the building now to change service, but that raises the worker's wages. What if I want to increase quality without raising wages...  El Presidente is pretty much useless. He can't help rush construction or join in fighting the rebels like in previous games. No option to sway election with speeches either. Building progression through research/time feels poorly developed and arbitrary. You earn research points through libraries and observatories which give you tech upgrades for different buildings. Unfortunately, you can only build tenaments and country houses at the beginning so if you want to upgrade your citizens to apartments to improve housing quaility you have to wait until the Cold War era (and then destroy all your previous housing and try to make the apartments fit into your city layout). I wasn't a fan of Tropico 4's purchasing blueprints, but I think it works better than this option. You can no longer see who is actually visiting a restaurant, pub, doctor's office, etc. You're just given a 'number of visitors'. Searching in the almanac is painful. All I want to do is find the least happy person and execute them, but you can't search by that. You can find the person with the lowest approval rating, but they're not necessarily the most unhappy. I know this is knit-picking, but I liked when you purchased a building upgrade in previous Tropico's, the physical improvement would appear (i.e. skylights in the cigar factory). There's no visual changes on the buildings when upgrading now. You can't toggle a dock to accept 'tourists only' so I keep having my teamsters dropping export resources at the dock in my tourist area. I don't want stinking peasants mixing with the upper echelons of society.  Only a handful of island maps to play. One of the biggest negatives for me is the overall lack of buildings (where's the gourmet restaurant??? or El Presidente's childhood museum?). I assume this is so we can be sold the inevitable expansion packs.  Suggestions:  The ability to choose the placement of our palace and dock at the outset of a sandbox game would be nice.  Consider reverting back to SOME, not all, of the core game designs from previous versions. My big ones would be charging specific amount of rent and setting worker's wages (please change this back). True roundabouts would be great for improving traffic flow.  Even with all the above, I'll still play it because I absolutely love Tropico, but just a lackluster delivery compared to past game versions. Overall rating from me would be a 6 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "Ultimately disappointing  I was a big fan of Tropico 3 and 4. This one is still playable, but just doesn't feel like it has the depth of the previous titles. Some of the additions I liked and thought were interesting changes, such as:  - You know have a ruling dynasty and you gain new family members as you go, with different abilities and bonuses  - You have different eras that you move through and different building available in each era. There is also a constitution with options in each area. This is how you control things like open or closed borders, conscription vs high quality military etc.  However, things I didn't like:  - It seems much harder to really get a picture of how your society is going. Little things like : previously in a school you could see all the students and click on them, now you just get '5/10 students' and you can't drill down on them. You can't seem to get a list of your whole population by education level, only the unemployed people. You can't see an individual persons needs anymore, just their ratings. It's harder to watch or track a single person. You can see thoughts, but not what they are currently doing, whereas they used to tell you they were going to the doctor, or to get food. You can't see how many people are using a garage or railway station. Lots of small features like this that they have removed make it really hard to diagnose problems, like whether people are able to commute effectively, or have enough services around them.  - Because of the above, when things go wrong, you often have no idea why. Why is the happiness rating high but my approval rating low? Why do I have so many of every type of entertainment building but the entertainment happiness is still low? Why do I have lots of teamsters but my factories are full on un picked-up goods? It's often hard to tell if it is something you are doing wrong, inconsistencies in the game or bugs. Why do I have so many homeless people who won't move into the housing I have built that is in a good location and appropriate for their wealth level? Why do I still have people listed as 'broke' when I have the social security edict turned on. Why is there a group protesting against my government, but when I click on them many have 85+ approval rating and happiness? What are they upset about? No idea.  All of that being said, the game is still fairly easy to complete, but for those like me that like to not just finish the mission but build the ultimate society in the process, it is so frustrating seeing things like a low approval rating due to homelessness when I have dozens of houses standing empty and other similar things. I ended up giving up because I just wasn't enjoying it any more.  For anyone new to the franchise, go and play 3 or 4, they are awesome.",

I do like the Eras though, but I hate how they did it. You just complete a mission and boom automatic Colonial Era to 1920s to Cold War to Modern Times. The way they talked about the whole Eras was that it was going to be amazing and interesting, but what we got was nothing of the sorts. I do like the Tropico series but as always, it's now at the point of anything new is just going to be crap. Hopefully this is the end of series and they go on to something new or else make Tropico 6 over the top - I kind of personally hope for Tropico in Space or something, something a little different. Oh, and avoid the DLCs, they're stupid. You get a building an outfit and maybe a very stupid and short mission. Not even worth $2, at the quality they are it should be a free update - or just simply already in the game.  Not recommended. Get Tropico 4.  EDIT: I take back what I said about 'not recommended' I do kind of recommend it. It isn't horrible, it's just a bit disappointing if you've played previous Tropico games. But, like they did with the other games was they added in what should've already been in-game via DLC. Grab it with all DLC around $20-$30 (or lower) is a good price. No DLC isn't bad but you'll understand what I mean in my review, it's very lacking in buildings.

Almost all alternate building skins have been removed so every freakin' apartment or tenement, etc. looks identical. No ability to create a custom, good looking island. Heck, you can't even place trees anymore.  Is it all bad? No. They added some new stuff like research and the 'eras' that are positive. At this point, though, I have to say DON'T BUY NOW.

            "review_text": "Tropico 5 is a okay game. Tropico 4 is much better in my opinion though. The following concerns the game at medium difficulty settings.   The campaign  The campaign includes only 4 different islands. You start with two that you can (or need to) switch after each mission. Constructed buildings will persist between missions on each island. Thus you only really need to build a good economy once and you are done for all remaining missions. The campaign is also rather short.   Game mechanics  -  General buildings : Several buildings grant additional advantages if they are build on higher terrain. However, 3 of the 4 campaign islands are completely flat.  -  Housing : Compared to the previous Tropicos, the housing system has been improved. Even small buildings make sense now.  - Industry: Tropico 5 allows you to build larger industry production lines. You can start with a logging camp, then add a saw mill to generate planks and then use these planks to build furniture. That's quite a nice feature.  - Population: You can change a policy (~ every 5 years) that controls the number if immigrants. However, I never noticed any big difference between the options regarding the number of people arriving on my island. With open borders I got about 20 immigrants per ship. This leads to a problem, because you really need a lot of people on the island. The only other option is to increase the number of births by building clinics and hospital (up to 50% increase in births). But that's still not enough and I constantly ran out of workers (~200 workers missing in a population of 1400 people). This wouldn't be so bad if you didn't need to build lots of healthcare, religous and entertainment buildings to keep your population happy.  -  Unrest : The unrest system appears to be out of control. For example, even if the military faction loves you, they just might start a coup to get rid of you. Also, I haven't found any reliable way to get rid of rebels (However, they only became annoying in 2-3 missions, thus it might be due to scripting).  -  Military : The military mechanics are just horrible. Certain buildings are marked as targets once rebells or other forces attack. All your armys will then start moving towards these targets, ignoring any enemy forces that they may encounter on their way. The enemy will shoot at you though! This often leads to several causalties before your army even starts fighting back. There is also an option to build an aircraft carrier that does not work at all, because the aircrafts won't fire if the enemy is close to buildings, which is usually the case. However, you can set it on 'fire at will', which will make them shoot and set your buildings on fire. That would be perfectly okay, if the rockets would actually damage enemies that are moving, but it appears that they mostly do damage on stationary enemies. Tropico 4 gave you more control over the movement of your armies, which made it much better in this respect.  -  Dealing with criminals, rebels, etc. : Similar to the previous tropico you can banish, arrest or kill people that you don't like. Or... well, you can at least issue the order to arrest them. Apparently the police doesn't really care about it. It takes years for them to take them to the prison.  All in all it's an okay game, but I wouldn't buy it again. Get Tropico 4 instead of Tropico 5.",

New dynasty system basically results in up to 7 extra managers for your buildings with no personality whatsoever. Almanac provides less information than before and lacks any sorting features. Controlling building budgets got simplified and there are less buildings, as well as less variety of housing.

The worst part about Tropico 5 is the extent to which I don't care about playing the campaign missions. The campaign leaves you with two basic islands to build off of, and your progress carries over mission-mission. This means that the actual act of 'city-building' gets extremely limited - because missions are now about tacking on some arbitrary requirement rather than striving for the most efficient/aesthetically pleasing system. Furthermore, as there are limitations on the number of consecutive times you can re-use an island, both islands have to be able to accommodate any industry (as missions can often boil down to 'make x, y, and then z industry'). Accommodating every industry makes the islands generic - taking away the adaptation game of Tropicos past of dealing with soil/resource/beauty variances. The overarching plot is dumb, and political tweaks (especially over-militarization as detailed in other reviews) just makes things worse.",

Everything just happens somehow. - The needs of people and factions are not pointed out anymore and you can't hold voting speeches anymore. - The humor is lacking when compared to Tropico 4. - You again need some extra DRM account to play the game.",

The first thing you notice - right off the bat - is it lacks the charm and personality of the Tropico series. While Penultimo returns as hilarious as ever, all your old friends like Reverend Esteban, El Diablo and the Mighty Chinese Dragon (who's hungry for your goods) are conspicuously absent. As such, factions and foreign powers feel like numbers on a page instead of personalities.  The campaign is way too short with way too little variety. You can grind through it (fairly effortlessly) in a few days, during which you'll get to play on four islands. That's right. FOUR islands. Two of which are basically the same. As for the running of Tropico, in pandering to the needs of the crown, the people and the powers that be, you get the feeling of being a thankless civil servant rather than being a power-mad dictator in love with his own reflection, as was the case in Tropico 4.  While the implementation of Dynasties was a great idea - in theory - it was lacking in execution. Instead of three traits, now you only get one per Dynasty member. And a grand total of about four or five costumes. Thinking about sending el Presidente to a construction site to speed things up, or a building to boost service? Think again, as the option to do so is gone.  On the positive side, it *looks* nice. But as it's a Tropico game (and not a super-realistic bro-shooter), it doesn't really need to. If anything, the mandatory DX11 requirements have screwed a lot of people out of playing it in the first place. I'll have to double check, but I could swear the background music (with a couple of exceptions) is the same re-heated soundtrack from Tropico 4. Come on, folks. There's a wealth of Calypso/Carribean/Latin music to choose from. Get a LITTLE creative!  In summary, I REALLY wanted to like this game. I really did. Tropico 4 is still one of my favourite games of all time. It's sad to see what could have been an amazing game not fully realised and ideas not fully explored. Until such time as there's adequate DLC (I have no doubt they'll churn it out piece by piece in $5 increments) to give it a little variety and scope, I can't really recommend it. Go play Tropico 4. It's still a damn good game if you want to indulge your inner megalomaniac.  P.S. As if it weren't bad enough you can't build a giant golden statue of yourself any more, you can't build ANY statues. How the hell are you supposed to feel like a tyrant if you can't remake Tropico in your likeness?",

First of, it is rather shallow compared to feature packed games like Unknown Horizons or Sim City. Since I'm now used to playing high quality strategy games like that (some for free), I expect commercial titles to go the extra mile.  Placing roads is akward at best. Yes, you learn to work around it, but a user interface should work for the player, not against him. During multiplayer you can build roads that stretch far out, but they cannot be demolished leaving you no room to make a single mistake while placing them. That is a tall order considering how akward the road editing is. The game rushes you from era to era and I often struggle to remain in one era because I feel I haven't gotten to use my newly researched technologies enough. This combined with very small map sizes (even huge is rather small compared to other games) makes it a poor choice for the month long builds I'm used to.  There is supposedly a way to save/load multiplayer games, but it's not clear to me at this point exactly how. As with seemingly all modern games, it lacks a proper server browser, instead your left with some social network thing for matchmaking and remote hosting. I didn't like it in L4D2 and I don't like it in this game either. Really old games like OpenTTD (which is free) solved load, save and multiplayer features a long time ago. Just do what they did.  The game has also crashed a few times, not a segfault, but a hard lock forcing me to get a console up to kill it.",

It's not a bad game, it is a complex economics and politics simulation but much of what made the series chaming and fun is gone. There's been some subtle change in the UI and it does not feel as smooth as the previous titles.  At this point in the series Tropico has peaked at Tropico 4 so if you are interested by the concept of the game - a banana republic simulator full of humor- I recommend you get T4 instead.",

I can't believe the lack of effort put in, it's so sad because Tropico 5 does have potential.  Pros: -Graphics are better by a little bit, but not much. Although there are some awful textures I noticed like fishing spots having terrible looking 2D fish and the newspaper building having a buggy garden texture. -El Presidente customization is slightly better than the old Tropicos and Slightly worse. I like that you can now customize the colours of your outfit and there is a good selection of faces and hair, but the game is severely lacking in outfit choices(DLC money grab sadly) -WASD Movement!! Thanks for that Kalypso.  Cons: -The menus are awful, big step down from Tropico 4. -Less buildings, e.g. No more firestation(It's a police station upgrade now) -Still can't paint ground textures. Such a simple but important feature to fix dirt patches in your city, come on Kalypso. -Building variety is non-existent. What a step down from Tropico 3 &amp; 4 and they didn't even have that great of variety but it was better than nothing, which is what we have here. -Hardly any gardens or objects to place(the stuff that makes your city look alive) limited to 10 small gardens and 6 large gardens( DLC later I'm sure, gross) -Can't control El Presidente anymore, and he doesn't fight in battles either. -El Presidente's ability tree has been downgraded since Tropico 4. Limited to one skill now instead of 3, very sad. -Flags, they look nice but depending how you rotate the buildings causes the flags to look like they're blowing in every direction. Looks bad, trust me. -Time moves a little too fast. -Co-op is awful, nuff' said  Conclusion: Buy Tropico 4, it's an awesome game, if you want to buy this turd; I'd say it's worth $5 tops, buy it on sale.

From what I have heard, it does not run all too well, so I guess I am not missing out on any possibly redeeming aspect. I am a long-time fan of the Tropico franchise and had a lot of fun with 3 and 4. Tropico 5 introduces some interesting new mechanics, which sounded cool at first: For example, there is the ability to fight. Disappointingly, this boils down to building some Barracks, Army Bases and other Military sites, since you cannot really control anything significant during an invasion of your island. Your soldiers move out automatically (following the same annoying pathing that also causes Teamster's Office hickups), the only thing you can specify are priorities (works just as fine as with Construction Offices - for which I would have to be in a super-sarcastic mood to call it good). Then, there is a tech-tree which you can research subsequently using research points generated by various buildings (Libraries, Colleges, you get the idea). The main flaw in tech-progression probably is the fact that you get your hands on most interesting things rather late in the game (but at that point at an incredibly high rate). Have an airport? Well, that's cool, some minutes later, you will be able to build a luxory version of aforementioned. You can destine managers to your production facilities in order to boost efficiency or grant other boni to the laborforce and or building's vicinity. As far as I understand, these managers don't level up (even though a star rating is visible for all of them), unless they are one of your heirs (which you can upgrade spending money from your swiss bank account). However, character progression is not as fun as in e.g. Tropico 3, since the traits are kept very basic in Tropico 5.  I have never seen Tropico as a hard-core simulation but rather a feel-good game. Earlier titles did achieve exactly that. Tropico 5, however, does not. Not only because the additions in terms of gameplay mechanics neither feel well thought out nor turn out to be interesting in any way. It is more, because the current iteration offers little to no feedback. Also the prequels did not show all too detailed information on what's wrong or doing well on your island, but this time, the lack of feedback reaches an annoyingly high level: Imagine, you are on a campaign mission, trying to accomplish a specific task when an election comes up. No problem, you think, my supporters greatly outnumber the critics. 1-2 months in the election phase, your ratings suddenly drop from ~60% to 45% - time to act! Opening the score overview, you however notice that all your ratings are well above 50% - too bad, so take a trip into the blue and build a Cathedral, a Hospital and some Entertainment buildings (all that using 'quick construct' and taking a money penalty scaling with the building's cost, since Tropicans are still utterly incompetent when it comes to building stuff). 'Phew' - you tell yourself, seeing the rating passing the magic 50% threshold again. 1 month before election, Autosave hits. Afterwards you are told that only 49% voted for you.  Would this have happend just once playing the career, I would not bother. But things like that keep happening constantly. Even if your island's economy florishes, you provide food through numerous supermarkets, keep crime rates low using police stations, reduce polution,... Problems only rarely amount from a lack of money (you usually have access to some very lucrative products at any point in time, and at a surplus once you reach cold war ages). They result from poor feedback: If you check a police station, an overlay shows you current crime rates. Waste disposal sites show you polution. Religious buildings _do not_ show saturation, neither do supermarkets or hospitals. Then again, Newsstations show a 'Liberty'-overlay - is that what you would call consistency? I wouldn't.  ...And then, there is bugs. Your game will crash, your game will freeze. Just now, trying to finish the campaign, the game froze, killing the entire progress of that particular mission. Not, that it happens often, but considering other annoyances, this is the tip of the iceberg.  Bottom line: It plays like 3 or 4. It looks a little better than 3 or 4. The music is still nice. The game provides even less feedback than the predecessors. The gameplay additions are not worth it. The campaign is comparably boring. The early ages evolve incredibly slow. Just too many flaws to keep the constant 'holiday'-feeling up.",

My beef with the game is not about the bugs or the fact that content that should have been in the base-game are now locked away in DLC (although these 2 factors certainly contributed to the lack of enjoyment of the game), but the overall regression of the game: Gameplay-wise, Simulation-wise &amp; Humour-wise. This changed from Tropico 4 to Carribean SimCity/Anno/Banished.  What made Tropico 4 awesome was the fact that you could follow a single Tropican and really feel as though this is a live person with hopes and dreams and family connections. In Tropico 5, not only can you NOT zoom in all the way to view the Tropican (jobs now share same character models), they don't do any interesting animations even if you decide to stalk them. People no longer stagger out of taverns drunk. And mothers don't get pregnant and stop work - they pop babies out of nowhere. Old people aren't old in the overworld. They don't record a history of past jobs and job experiences gained. Tropicans no longer have individual stats that indicate how stupid/intelligent, courageous/cowardic or leadership/non-leadership material they are. People truly become aggregate statistics. Like resources I could use and dispose without any attachment.  Election speeches which gave El Presidente a personal touch and added to the humour of the game, are no longer present. The presidente and your dynasty members just bum around all day doing nothing, their existence justified only by the modifier buffs they have.  Even the new features introduced felt extremely gamey.  You pop out a dynasty heir due to your 'rrrolicking sex life' but we are never introduced to the spouse/partner. And you don't get to choose the name of your kid. Come to think of it, I don't think you can rename your Tropicans either. I don't know how trade routes work, but I was under the impression I had to fulfill a contract of shipping a set quantity of resources within a time limit of 5 years. But after shipping my first batch of less than 1000 resources the game decided I fulfilled my requirements and the active trade route disappeared.  The humour of the game was truly lost by bad voice-acting and lame jokes. Where is my Brunhilde Van Hoof? El Diablo? Where is my smarmy Penultimo? Instead we get characters that take themselves too seriously like Evita Vasquez, the Crown toad and that Illuminati guy. You also have to suspend your disbelief with bizarre choices like female soldiers and miners in the Colonial Era.   The almanac interface was also NOT user-friendly, as there were no back buttons to the previous page. Information was also presented in a clusterf**k of texts.

Wait for a good deal before buying it, because I enjoyed Tropico 4 a lot, too, and it's worth the money. Tropico 5 in basis version is not.  I did play a lot because I played through the campain and it was really enjoyable and challenging (due to the limited resources). And micromanaging all the jobs in such a way that the people don't starve is also important in the game. Otherwise the only thing you get to know in the game is about what to build in which order and where to leave room to expand later. I love that the game has the new ideas about different Times, the family managment is also a lot of fun. I just wish the buildings in the DLCs would be in the original game.  In short: This game is a delicious burger with meat/soja. If you want to have sauce, lettuce and bacon you have to buy the DLCs.",

You are helpless to sit back and hope they all don't attack the enemy force one at a time like a typical henchman. The trade system requires boats for special deals with different countries/sides but I was unable to find the unit prices of any of the trade goods to plan my growth accordingly. Then with the dynasty, it’s great to have some illegitimate children every once and a while, but can't I have legitimate children? Or choose their name or not get annoyed when I have to customize a dynasty member?  Besides spelling errors, over the top (and borderline racist) caricatures of the various factions, and general half way approach I've been getting used to, they game is at least a decent waste of time.

This is why: If you never played tropico it is basicly a game about being a dictator on a tropical island (without genocides or crazy Sh*t) So let's start, tropico 4 VS 5  In tropico 4 you want (economicly speaking) to produce much and high quality goods, or you can focus on MANY raw materials, mainly exotic fruits. in tropico 5 you want to produce only a certain thing beacuse you have trading offers which limit EXTREMELY and i mean EXTREMELY the potential of you building your economy, you can build a rum distilery but you can get 0 MONEY out of it beacuse you have no offers on your dock  In tropico 5 you can issue a lot more edicts like: no free food, contraception ban, social engieniring, socialsecurity etc etc In tropico 4 you can issue some eddicts like: National day ,social security ,food for the people not so many as in Tropico 5 and i have to give 5 this.  In tropico 5 you will be in debt every time, (but in the modern ages) and you should expect only forgin aid to help you beacuse without it you can't do anything In tropico 4 you will be in debt only if you can't manage the economy and when you are in debt you feel like : 'Ooops i have done some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sh*t' and you have to THINK on how to make the treasury full(er)  In tropico 5 PEOPLE ♥♥♥♥♥ REBEL TO MUCH, ok i understand you can be a rebel but at some ok conditions and food+shelter+a clinic nearby you become a rebel, i tell you, you can gave 5 rebel attacks in no time and, no problem you will crush them secound time you play, but the frist time after you build your stuff some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ people attack you ITS HORIBLE, you have to focus on armies and not on food beacuse of them. Frist time it's fun, secound meh BUT THIRD they ♥♥♥♥ you off beacuse they have 0%%%% REASONS to rebel against you. In tropico 4 people rebel for serious things, like: they want a hospital and you didn't bought one even though you could. or they rebel if you pay them very little and dont provide them with shelter and hospitals and that seems very ok to me if you can't take care of your people they should rebel, not if they are bored like they do in 5.  I can go on and on now but TRUST ME if you buy tropico 4 you will have a better time, all those positive reviews haven't played tropico 4 Goodbuy (------------ You see what i did there? :D ",

The Happiness is flaky too, something just doesnt tick in this one, jobs not being taken, homeless with empty homes, it just doesnt work, maybe it is the awful road placement?

No crime, no rebels, safe for the few episodes where rebels were part of the plot. Even the military part, was too easy, with the aircraft carrier and the towers being overbuffed.  The nice idea of guiding an island through a century was not as well polished as I hoped for. You can just hit 'upgrade all' at the start of a new age, and you will see nothing of a historical city core. The idea of a dynasty was great, too, but how can one El Presidente live for 200 years? Why did one El Presidente guide two islands at once? On the cover there were two El Presidentes, which would have been more logical.  The last major drawback was that this game was more serious than the previos games. The speakers were less funny, less random interaction. Even Penultimo sounded clinically depressed.  The core ideas of the game are great. Having islands that follow you throughout the times is nice.  Alas, the game was centered on 'newbs', with too little challenge. Also I guess many features were cut to have many DLCs later on. The graphics are very nice, but that is in my opinion only a minor part in a city-building game.",

While I'm sure they'll be fixed eventually, I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that a not-yet-ready product was rushed to market.  As to the game itself....  If you enjoyed the micro-managing of earlier versions, you're out of luck. An awful lot seems to happen without any input whatsoever. El Presidente seems to serve no particular role. (There aren't even election speeches.)  Most of the humor in previous versions is gone as well. This game lacks a lot of the fun that made previous iterations enjoyable.  Will any of this be fixed in future patches? Who knows? If previous versions are anything to go by, we'll have to wait until Tropico 6. (Assuming this version isn't a franchise killer.)  One person commented on Steam that it seems to have been dumbed down for console players, and it certainly feels that way.  As to whether you should buy the game, I share the comment of one of the reviews I've read: 'Maybe, but only if you like this type of game and are able to forgive some problems.'  Color me sad.",

            "review_text": "First off: the game is by far too easy, and far too short. The main campain took me ~20 hours, same as Tropico 4: Modern Times, whilst the main campain of Tropico 4 took me over 80 hours.  The economy is Tropico 5 far easier than in the previous games, no challenge at all. Effectively there are no factions in Tropico 5, everyone is always happy. No crime, no rebels, safe for the few episodes where rebels were part of the plot. Even the military part, was too easy, with the aircraft carrier and the towers being overbuffed.  The nice idea of guiding an island through a century was not as well polished as I hoped for. You can just hit 'upgrade all' at the start of a new age, and you will see nothing of a historical city core. The idea of a dynasty was great, too, but how can one El Presidente live for 200 years? Why did one El Presidente guide two islands at once? On the cover there were two El Presidentes, which would have been more logical.  The last major drawback was that this game was more serious than the previos games. The speakers were less funny, less random interaction. Even Penultimo sounded clinically depressed.  The core ideas of the game are great. Having islands that follow you throughout the times is nice.  Alas, the game was centered on 'newbs', with too little challenge. Also I guess many features were cut to have many DLCs later on. The graphics are very nice, but that is in my opinion only a minor part in a city-building game.",

The gameplay is fun and the humor is funny however the big addition of military and combat they added in 5 is why I would not reccomend this game. The combat is awful, you cannot control your troops, make any deployment decisions or really do anything with them at all. When you are invaded, your military buildings will spawn soldiers who will then charge into the fight and that is all there is to it, the combat is boring and not well implemented.",

Even more than Tropico 4, this game is a wastebasket which the publisher hopes people will fill with paid DLC. I can't comment on the sandbox play as I quit in disgust about 10 or 12 hours into the campaign, and simply exploring what the 'new' Tropico had to offer. I would recommend just getting Tropico 3 or 4 unless your expectations are really low and you really just want the persistent island / multiple eras stuff with little to no depth or strategy in setting up / leveling your Leader and his traits.  To me this game is essentially Tropico 4 with a much less satisfying and rushed-feeling campaign, less of the characteristic humorous missions and writing that the games are known for, less interesting gameplay, with basic buildings and features either entirely removed, or withheld so that they can charge for it later..

I started in tutorial mode and was enjoying my game, I had plantations for every crop, had built a catholic mission as soon as I could and had 5 military towers and a military base. I was even sending out troops on recon missions.  Looking forward to opening up the rest of the game, I already had tenaments and houses opened and had built several tenaments and mansions and houses. I had a second mine going, a clinic, casino, two restaurantes, tobacco and textile factory, Two lumber mills and two logging production units, parks and whole load of housing built as well as a police station and fishing dock. I had a power plant and was sending out experdition to get the ancient ruins discovered.  Then I was amazed to get warings in the tutorial about trades notices and other edicts. When my game came back into play, I had lost everything - I have the save to prove it, but each time I load it, - the tutorial interrupts my game.   I just wish they had told me this would happen at the start. If you know how to play this game as do I, my advice would be to start in normal mode- not tutorial mode.   I am now really dismayed at the thought of having to do all that again - it has just spoilt my enjoyment of the game.   Damn the Tropico devs for not letting you continue your game to normal play after starting in the tutorial mode. I don't think I have the energy to contiue playing. Really peed off.   It will be some time and I will have to be bored s*** less before I decide to waste any more of my life and leisure time on this game.",

It quickly becomes repetetive. Comabt has managed to become worse where your armies take weird pathing to get where they need to go. There are no cool statues to put out or decorations other than 'small park' and 'large park'. Worst of all is that it is incredibly frustrating to actually see what is going wrong on your island. The Alamanac is a wreck. This game needs a total revolution to get back to its roots. It has become an elderly El Presidente.",
