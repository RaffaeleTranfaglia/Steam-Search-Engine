            "review_text": "Hidden Object Adventure Category game.  As far as hidden object games go, this was a decent one. The graphics were clear enough to make out objects, the storyline wasn't really all that engaging, but it did give you some sense of urgency for getting to the end.  Highs: Decent amount of diversity in the puzzles Areas didn't seem reused or re-skinned Each area had a purpose and revisiting later in the game could lead to a hidden object area Purposeful hidden object games (you come away with something for your inventory to use elsewhere) There is a built-in strategy guide to walk you through the game if you get stuck somewhere.  Lows: Description of items is vague sometimes in hidden object games (I.E. Looking for a Horn that may actually be a bugle, or a kettle that may be a Tea pot, etc) The hint system really needs to be more specific. The ending leaves much to be desired.  Overall I'd recommend this game for hidden object lovers out there. Don't expect too much out of the story though.",

            "review_text": "The first impression of this game was very positive. The graphics in this game are well drawn and with animated water splashing around the cliffs it all looked quite nice and polished. The story of being stranded on a deserted island sounded intersting enough for a HOG.  However this game gets quite tedious after a while, the hint system doesn't tell you where you have to go next and there is no map for fast travel, that combined with the need to go forward and backwards across the whole island all the time really pulls the fun out of it. There is also very little sense of progression as you go through the same rooms over and over again. HOG scenes, that contain important items for progression, also frequently respawn a few rooms behind you, which feels really arbitary and just stretches out the game needlessly.  Nice production values aside, I really didn't found this one enjoyable. ",

Since there isn't a map or fast travel, you have to keep wandering around trying to guess which of the scenes you've already visited twice will randomly be active again. Also the sound effects are beyond irritating and the graphics are somewhat blurry in fullscreen mode.",

Not anything spectacular either, but if you want something to kill some time, this is a good option.  Spoiler alert.       For Mike's final puzzle the M shape is for the 'bad ending' the Y shape is for the 'good ending.'",
