The Hardy Brothers were a fun addition and I especially liked how I didn't have to spend large amounts of time wandering aimlessly around to find things as the train is much easier to get used to, in my personal opinion. If you're a fan of Nancy Drew games, or just want a fun mystery point-and-click to pass the time, get it!",
