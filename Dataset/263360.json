            "review_text": "This is actually quite fun. I've spent many enjoyable hours playing 3089 and 100% recommend it (even if it sounds like I don't!).  Positives: The screen shots are far worse than the game graphics. I cranked it up to x16 AA and everything is crisp and clean on the edges. (Unlike the SS's) Quests keep you occupied. The ability to build stuff like a radar, skill buffer, and teleporter (more on the teleporter later). Your weight affects how well you can move. Hundreds of pounds over your max and you won't be sprinting but movement won't stop alltogether or even slow you down that much. BUT if you want to go fast with a hoverboard, the hoverboard will not move if you exceed it's weight limit. Translocators shoot a sphere and warp to it's location grappling hooks shoot a line out and if it strikes an object you will be pulled up and gravity guns for moving stuff around like boxes all add to the game.  It's fun building your weapon. Rifle has a stock.. barrel.. mag.. silencer.. scope. Stock determines number of shots. Single shot will be more accurate and powerful (per round typically) while increases in the number of rounds fired with each trigger pull (think shotgun) will decrease the damage of the individual rounds, as well as accuracy of the weapon. In addition there can be effects.. like a percentage of dmg translating into an explosion or rounds homing in on targets.  Barrel determines base accuracy, range, damage and speed the round travels. Mag determines how often the weapon can fire, and how much ammo is consumed per shot. Silencer silences the weapon. You're less likely to be noticed. I haven't noticed a decrease in damage. As with any piece there can be additional stat buffs so less noise are more stats are always a good thing. The scope well.. duh.  I play a sniper. I had a 220 range barrel but the accuracy and bullet speed were a bit low and swapped out for a 160 range with a 10% accuracy increase and almost double the speed. As you can see this single weapon had MANY options.  The launcher's are just like they sound. Can be lob based, but also add additional effects like corosion (DoT) or Leech. Fire slower, fewer rounds before a reload and consume more ammo.  Negatives: This is going to sound like I'm being picky.. and I am. These are things that just irritated me a bit. 3 Types of guns. Period. Pistol, Rifle and Launcher. Each of those come in the normal ammo using version and the 'Energy' version. I've never tried the pistols so won't be talking about them. The rifle vs launcher, i've tried them in both normal and energy versions. Energy seems to simply use your 'energy' as a different kind of ammo. That will regenerate to 25% on it's own. You can recharge at a station or use items to boost it up to 100% (or higher if you equip an item with high energy, recharge, then remove it). Ex: I have over 1500% energy because I have a hoverboard that grants me ~360 energy. I've used items while on it to recharge it to 100% (while on the board). As soon as I get off the board I loose the 360 energy stat bonus but I keep the pool of energy. That said. I don't use energy weapons.  Why not? I don't see a point. It seems to use a % of your energy per shot. So at 5 energy or 500 energy skill, each shot from that level 7 rifle will consume the percentage listed on the mag.   While there are many ways to build a weapon, there are really only 3 ranged. I'm trying to build a bit of a shotgun rifle for close quarters but the most i've found so far is 3 rounds. Keeping it non explosive so i don't damamge myself. These numbers may increase later but it just feels like i'm hammered into a specific type of weapon due to lack of variance in the earlier part of the game.  Followers: Don't plan on doing any damage if you want an army following you. They will run around you, in front of you, and everywhere. They'll die to the daily meteor showers and screw up quests. It's a great concept and thats how I started out, till i realized i couldn't do anything at all as a ranged character with an Army. If a stray round hits one of your followers they'll ALL turn against you instantly.  Building a base: You can construct walls. Cool! But when I tried to set up a base inside the blue base, it was a bit disappointing. I had my gear like boxes, teleporter, radar all setup way in the back. I had created a maze on the 3rd floor with low walls for fall back points if I had to retreat further in. Every other time I go on a quest though I return to a bunch of bots already set up shop all throughout the maze just wandering around. Turrets and all. The enemy has always ignored my structures.. and are more of a bother than anything significant.  Quests: I can't stand the 'don't be detected' type quests. I try to avoid them but every now and then one slips in. The 'kill' without being detected by target isn't bad since i'm a sniper, but 'no additional detection' and the 'spy' ones where you have to sit there and watch or avoid all detection can be brutal.  The World: Now, the fact that the world is generated each time is good.. and terrible. After my first 'leadership' attempt the 2nd world I got was surrounded on all sides by an ocean. A good 300m straight down. I kept getting quests in the water. While you can go into the water.. it makes it far more difficult (at least in early stages) to deal with enemies that can come from any direction.. up.. down.. sides.. everywhere inbetween. Also, not a lot of cover in the middle of the ocean. Ever try protecting a bot? It's not easy. Now do that with zero cover and any direction of approach in a 3 dimensional plane. To get back again (this was before I had unlocked teleporters.. which.. charge money) was a 10 min swim to the nearest ledge that had a ramp.  What i'm saying is, once you start a game, look at your map. You may be in for a really difficult challenge starting out.  Other: Surveryors: Don't kill them unless you have a plan for dying a lot. They die EASY. At around level 6 area I decided to try my hand at them. I killed a few dozen and got some great gear, including a level 90 hoverboard. But for every one you kill, 2 more are sent to kill YOU. And they go up 10 levels every time they do. By the time they were up to level 110 I was dying WAY too much. They lock on at a long range and 1 shot me. So how do you get all those ones to stop coming after you? Each time you die to one, it despawns. You have to let each one kill you so that it despawns. Remember if you kill it, 2 more will spawn. (I'm pretty sure about the 2 spawning to kill you, I was kinda busy killing and looting to count each one. In the end I had to suffer around 12 deaths to make them stop attacking).  Held items. They have stats yes. But they do not apply unless you have them selected. If you have a rilfe and dagger equipped but have the rifle out, the dagger's stats will not apply until you swap from the rifle to dagger. So don't load yourself down with a bunch of stat based weapons. I go with my primary weapon which uses ammo, and a backup that uses energy (in case I ever run out of ammo.. which.. hasn't happened yet).  Wishes: I wish there were doors, or something to prevent things from simply spawning wherever they want. I wish turrets you placed were not temporary. What's the point of gathering all the materals to defend your base if the enemy can simply spawn inside and your turrets just go 'poof' over time? I wish there were some other options for rifles to make them more like a shotgun or sniper instead of a middle of the road rifle. I wish grapplers, translocators and hoverboards held WAY more than each level currently allows. I'm always over what they can handle in the level range i'm questing. I've accepted that fact since i'm a sniper/tank type with high agility. I can run crazy fast, carry a bunch etc.. but i'm not going to be able to translocate across a gap, or grapple my way up a cliff.   Edit: Spelling :P",

The visuals while maybe not stunning in the classic sense are really rather fun and it creates a unique and interesting to world to explore. The skill system seems like a nice idea but so far I have only found a few skills that really seem to change gameplay. If you want an open ended sci-fi quest game with unique visuals, simple crafting and a great way of sucking away the hours, go for this!",

People will complain about the graphics but hey, its voxel...what are you expecting. I found the game enjoyable if quite difficult. Melee is definately more fun than shooting as you can lock on your enemy and do a charing attack. Gameplay comes down to completing quests to earn skill points and then later assigning those sp's to skills. For 8 bucks you cant go wrong with a game that will play on any pc just fine and give hours of enjoyment. The developer is just one guy with some help from artists and such for publicity. The music is very immersive for a futuristic setting with the female singer adding a lovely melody to the exploration track.",

The game has great music, even though it's subtle the overworld music really immerses you into the game and kind of gives that Deus Ex vibe where you'd have one song going up until you come across an enemy where battle music would pick up,Speaking of enemies the AI is somewhat brutal with the player and is quite attentive so try to avoid going into direct confrontation when not in Quests. Quests run quite smoothly as well with it being a simple press of E at a Quest station to read what quests are available.  The game's graphics really don't hinder the whole feel of the game, at first glance you may say it looks bad, but when actually playing it grows on you as a cartoonish kind of style which makes weapons look nice and not always the dull weaponry you'd come across in other games.

When progressing through the story, new ememies are unlocked and become a common fight in your world that is unique to YOU. I definatly recommend this game expecially to those that dont have max settings and quad cores ect...  The main downside is that multiplayer doenst seem to work... my brother and I tried about 30 times to try to get it to work but we had no luck.

The graphics are a little on the 'meh' side, but the gameplay and soundtrack are both phenominal. The story is interesting, revolving around an experimental algorithm that gives robots emotions and a never-ending war on the planet XaX. Combine that with a randomly generated world that never ends, a variety of side quests, a large amount of enemies to fight, a good crafting system, and LAZORLEGS, you have a fantastic game that shouldn't be missed by any fan of the genre.  Like another review said, bonus points for friendly developer. Every update to this game has brought good changes so far, and I still recommend it to any RPG fan. Do NOT let the aforementioned 'meh'-ish graphics (though they have received some improvement) deter you from buying this game.  9.5/10 from me, and I only took 0.5 off because I personally find XaX Spirits (enemy from the game) a bit annoying to fight at times.",

Pros -stats for rpg fanatics like myself -a wide variety of weapon possibilities due to random weapon stats and interchangeable parts -well balanced weapon archetypes -a lot of gameplay due to randomly generated quests (they appear to be infinite, but I'm not quite sure) -the ability to build your own 'base' -possibly unlimited world -co-op multi-player  Cons -poorly implemented steam compatibility -poorly implemented multiplayer (requires port-forwarding, which really limits acssessability) -bad graphics (not sure if its a Con, it adds a bit of charm to the game) -base building could use some improvements -can't timerip bosses (the only percievable use for timeripping other than abnormaly large hordes of enemies) -you can really screw yourself over in your first world if you're not careful  Overall I think the game is a good buy, and hopefully the problems that hamper it currently will be removed.

On top of that, you can get other robots to follow you, kill any enemies in the way, and get slaughtered once they run out of health :'( . There are plenty of quests to do, so you'll never run out of things to do. You can choose your playstyle; wether it be completely relying on other team mates to do the work for you then coming in and stealing the kill, or going out there alone then realising the mistake you made. I have yet to try the multiplayer, but im sure it will be heaps of fun, being able to do everything i said above: With a teammate. Co-op is always great fun in games, wouldn't you agree?

This proved not to be the case as I was sucked in by the interesting world, free form character generation and the equipment customization. What expected to be a shallow RPG experience turned into a vast world of option surrounded by a procedurally generated landscape.    While it’s lack of direction is daunting at first it soon revealed a degree of freedom seldom seen in videogames. Despite this freedom the game does not lack content, the procedurally generated quests, while sometimes strange and nonsensical create there own little stories. You could build your character as a mercenary and take the quests where you kill groups of bots, or you could make a spy, sneaking around planting bugs and eavesdropping on the robotic citizens of Xax. Perhaps you want to build a pilot and fly around the world. Or you could be a leader and get other bots to do your dirty work for you.   What I’m trying to say is that 3089 is an amazingly deep and enjoyable experience that anyone who enjoys action RPG’s should give a shot. ",

It's nice to be in a world of triangles vs. all of the procedural boxy voxel games out there. The procedural generation makes exploring your world interesting, and even when things don't line up -quite- right, I never ran in to very many situations where a mission couldn't be completed. Combat works well, and scrounging for gun parts adds to the fun. The soundtrack fits well and never felt repetitive. Other pluses are low system requirements, multi-player, and the ability to build your own bases (kinda). Now for critiques; the procedural side missions can become repetitive after a time, and the procedural world can make it difficult to remember land marks. Still, I think the positives outweigh in my opinion. If you like the cartoon Reboot, you will probably like this game.",

Graphics aren't showy (aren't meant to be), but I have never lagged on this game (which is significant, because my laptop can't run anything well.). Lots of fun stuff to do, whether it be fighting, using the Hoverboard/Grapple combo to whizz around the map, successfully sneaking past a cluster of enemies, and far more. And all this was made by a, quote, 'one man team (and a busy one at that)', who goes by phr00t. I highly recommend this game.  Edit: Recently, I have found myself playing this alot less. Upon examination, I realized the game , unless all you do is mess around, boils down to a near endless search for loot with better stats. While I still recommend this game, I feel it might not be as good as what I posted above.",
