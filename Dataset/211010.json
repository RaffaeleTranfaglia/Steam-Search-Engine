Anyways, if you like to shoot aliens up in a tad old-school style, this is for you. Don't expect many hours out of it though. There are tad kewl mechanics, kewl weapons (can't afford the best ones that easily), many aliens, tasks you don't pay much attention to, stupid lines said by the zeroes and ones you're playing as, and many aliens.  All in all, this game isn't a 'must' in any possible way, but if you like these kind of games, you can give it a shot!  Lil' Sucky Gameplay to go with the review.

AVOID!",
