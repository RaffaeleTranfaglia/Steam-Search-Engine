The gameplay's surprisingly deep with locational damage, stealth mechanics and a variety of different player vehicles that handle very differently.   You'll probably need a moment to get used to the control systems and there are a few little details you might not notice straight away.   You'll learn which buildings explode from experience (if a building shows a health bar when lightly damaged you won't want to be near it when it's destroyed!), how to corral your enemies (they won't destroy environmental obstacles so you can carve out killing fields for them) and learning to manage your shields (blue bar replenishable from drops from slain enemies) and your health (green bar, when it's gone it's gone).  Then after about half an hour you'll have the basics down and be romping through the streets having the time of your life.  At a boom time for indie games this really stands out from the pack. Certainly worth the money.",

And the soundtrack is amazing.  I've heard some people complain about the controls... and I would just say stick with it and muscle memory will take care of the rest. there are alternate controls schemes available but I never felt the need to try them. once you nail how to move and how to lead your weapons fire, you'll be an unstoppable murder machine. buy Brigador, ok?",

            "review_text": "Brigador looks like a fairly straightforward action game at first glance, but it isn't. You can't simply rush in like an idiot stomping and shooting everything. Past the very first babby missions, you must develop situational awareness, tread carefully (e.g., don't back into a gas station while aiming across the map), take facing into account (flanks and rear = more damage), take terrain and map layout into account (and use it against enemies where possible), manage sound because it attracts the attention of enemies (an exploding space cannon makes a great deal of noise; firing a quiet weapon, very little), prioritize targets, conserve your ammo, aim carefully, and use your special equipment wisely.  There's quite a learning curve at first. Learning to steer and aim simultaneously takes some getting used to, as does figuring out the flow of the game and what does what. One mistake can get you blown up or swarmed and botch an entire mission.  The maps and terrain are quite varied, from landscaped suburban housing enclaves to open fields to neon-bedecked cities to pipe- and factory-filled industrial zones. The faction and unit composition of the enemy force also differs and makes for markedly differently play, especially during the campaign.  There are currently 52 vehicles to choose from, more-or-less evenly split between mechs, tanks, and agravs (hover vehicles), and further split between three factions. Their attributes and handling vary widely, and many have special traits; even their profile can have an effect (needle-like vehicles are harder to hit head-on, for example). The smaller, frailer vehicles cost more to unlock and are harder to play but grant reward multipliers at mission end. There are 40 weapons split between five hardpoint categories and 4 pieces of special equipment (smokescreen, EMP grenade, optic camo, and demolition blast). These can be mixed and matched however you see fit, although the type of hardpoints (each vehicle has two) are fixed. These options allow for a great deal of flexibility and variety.  Most of the unlocks after vehicles and equipment are for progressively longer and harder Freelance campaigns, and for pilots. Higher-level pilots increase mission difficulty and payout, and cost progressively more to unlock. There are also a bunch of Intel/Lore items to unlock that offer a lot of backstory for the game.  The game's almost purely skill-based. Taking a frail vehicle piloted by a high-difficulty pilot through a long, high-difficulty Freelance campaign is possible, but requires a great deal of practice and familiarity with the game.  A mech simulator it ain't, but it is a beautiful, detailed, well-made game that requires a lot more than mindless button-mashing and features hard (potentially EXTREMELY hard), but fair, difficulty.",

            "review_text": "Brigador is a tight experience done well. A bit remeniscent of the old Sega Genesis Strike series (Desert Strike and its successors), Brigador puts you as a lone vehicle in a big, hostile world with your choice of main objectives to complete as well as resupply locations and optional side missions that can help limit the enemy's ability to respond to you.   Simple controls- move, aim, shoot, and a defensive power- belie the underlying complexity brought to the table by noise, line-of-sight, variable armor facings (side + rear == more damage taken), a shield overcharge mechanic, and terrain offers varying degrees of toughness, resistance to being shot through, and hinderance to mobility.   When you start the game, you'll feel like you're undergunned and under-armored, with no way to do better. Give it an hour or two, however, and you may find yourself sweeping the entire map and leaving fully shielded and loaded with every optional objective completed, and ready for a harder difficulty.   Negatives? One complaint, and one warning.   The only real complaint I have is that there is exploding terrain that will do massive damage to you, and is relatively hard to see. Nothing like spending 30 minutes carefully clearing a series of maps only to fail because you didn't see a muted green pipe or muted yellow gas canister against the overwhelmingly dark gray-brown-green background. Realistic or not, these things need to be more visible.   It's also worth noting while that you could spend a loooooooong time unlocking all of the vehicles, weapons, pilots (difficulty levels), and maps that the game has to offer, Brigador is fundamentally a fairly compact experience. The vehicles and weapons do handle significantly differently, but after a few hours of feverently playing the game I find myself feeling like I've gotten most of what I can get out of the game. I would like to revisit it some more, but I'm a bit burned out.   Brigador is, however, a game that knows exactly what it wants to be and executes on it very well. If the potential that the map/difficulty unlock progression might not get its hooks into you and limit you to a single digit hours of play isn't a significant negative to you, I'd highly recommend it.",

Death comes swiftly if you're careless, and is a wrench after a long level.   Two ways to play - campaign missions are varied, short and hard, and unlock in sequence. Freelance lets you choose your risk/difficulty/reward payoff and play longer missions.  Fundamentally the gameplay is really solid - you need to plan your approach and get through without burning through all your ammo or getting cornered and obliterated. There's more than one way to do it, and it can take a few goes to find the approach that works for you. Getting the hang of aiming and using cover is key.  I melted a bunch of robots from the other side of wall using a black hand irradiator, it was great.  More hours in, I keep coming back for the fundamental gameplay. Because you're rewarded for risk, taking out the smaller vehicles and higher difficulty pilots and trying to get through the freelance levels alive is really good fun. Effective combinations of weapons tie in to your strategy, as does ensuring you can scavange enough ammo and shields to keep going.",

I don't know what game could fill-in that blank; this game has been a very novel experience for me.  However, there are at least three things I can say with confidence about this game...  1.) This game has a steep learning curve for at least the first hour. For me, this game was somewhat 'inaccessible' at first. It was hard for me to learn, and it was hard for me to get into it.  2.) This game is best for players who enjoy high-difficulty games in which they need to replay levels over and over before they get that satisfying buzz once they finally beat it. I am that sort of player.  3.) This game just *feels* cool. I can't pinpoint what it is exactly, but it just feels so freaking sick. I also love the retro aesthetic.

Shot arcs and elevation also come into it, and momentum is imparted from your vehicle to your projectiles. It takes a bit to get used to but it's satisfying when you get good with it.  Tactical details like weak side and rear armour on vehicles, and the way the AI responds to sound gives you some fun decisions to make.

It is probably the best, most accurate representation of one man versus an army and the best top-down isometric game I've ever played. TL;DR at bottom -&gt;   While I loved the difficulty I can see how it could be off putting at first. You can choose your difficulty but not in the traditional way. Picking a pilot with a higher or lower max difficulty, choosing a stronger or weaker vehicle and then a longer or shorter operation (how manyand what levels you want to play) all make the game easier or harder and affect your payout. Even if you choose an easier pilot and powerful vehicle this game demands a LOT of situational awareness and a fair amount of thought before you act. Learning what vehicle and weapon set ups complement each other is important. Part of it is also the controls. The default controls are relative to your vehicles hull and not to the screen as most top-down isometric games are but If you can get used to this movement I feel it adds to the games depth. If not there is a 'tank' style control option.   The sheer number of vehicles and weapons means nearly anyone can find a combination that they will find fun, suits their play style, or fits the challenge they've set for themselves. The vehicles vary wildly from tiny tread bikes to fortress-like tanks. Hovering fighter planes to floating school buses with a battleship gun, and last but not least mechs from basicaly a suit of armor to four story tall doom machines. The guns are just as crazy, machine guns, tank caliber shotguns, and gas cannister launchers to name a few. At the time of this review there are 52 vehicles, 40 weapons and 4 specials and the devs have added more than a few of those after exiting early access including new pilots.   The style of everything and the music work so well together to set the tone of a retro, somewhat dystopian future and as an added bonus, despite a rather simple premise of 'pick killing machine, destroy all enemies' there is an unusualy deep lore to Brigador. If you read the descriptions to the numerous pilots, vehicles, weapons and the info and lore available for purchase ingame the world really begins to come to life.  -&gt; It is very hard for me to find any faults with Brigador. The feel, the difficulty, and the variety of it all makes for a very satisfying game. The attention to every detail from difficulty to balance the atmoshphere and lore is amazing. The ONLY thing I feel is missing is multiplayer content or even just co-op but, honestly, it doesn't need it and that would just add a lot of unnecessary work. If you're thinking the price is too much for a simple 2d game, all I can say is its not as simple as it looks and the amount of work that went into and continues to go into this game makes it worth every penny of the $20 price tag. You wont be disappointed.  P.S. This is the first review I've ever written. This game is THAT good. Normally dont feel a need to write a review but this game and its devs need more appreciation.",

Since my purchase, Brigador remains a very enjoyable and cathartic game. The graphics are very detailed, with entrancing lighting effects, satisfying destructability and complex, but rewarding vehicles with which to to wreak havoc. The ones I have encountered thus far include tanks, various sized mechs and hover vehicles, with each class having unique movement, stats, weapons, etc. Admittedly, it takes a while to acquaint yourself with the controls, as most vehicles have separate movement and turret controls, which can be slightly disorienting at first, but these are quickly learned through addictive gameplay that doesn't punish failure. If you die, just start the level again, maybe with one of the different vehicles permitted for the mission and try a different approach (smoke to hide your movement, or camo to sneak into position).   Another point of potential contention is that the game doesn't feature savegames. The missions aren't typically that long, but are sometimes difficult and losing progress right near the end can be a little frustrating. This frustration has not stopped me from diving right back in however, and there is a clear sense of satisfaction when completing the level, despite having died multiple times in the session.  I must make specific mention of the excellent soundtrack done by Makeup and Vanity Set. It gives the action a great feel and I find myself nodding along, as I stomp, crush and smash my way through the levels. I have since bought the soundtrack, as well as two other albums by MAVS and it is definitely worthwhile checking out.  For what it's worth, I highly recommend Brigador.",

You can't just wade in and expect everything to be fine, you have to plan your engagements. This is honestly the best isometric shooting game I've ever played, and I played plenty of them when they were temporarily popular in the 90s.",

Then you start making money for blowing ♥♥♥♥ up. Still pretty simple. Then you find out about 'Freelance Mode' and now you can buy your own pilot and mech and loadout. Less simple. Now you realize that this is where the real challenge lies in the game. Simplicity gone. Now the real fun starts.",

It would be cool if they created DLC or another game that was related to Brigador's universe. As for the gameplay, It tends to be varied probably because of all the options available to the player once he or she has some mastery of the controls. Yes, mastering the control scheme was tricky for me and I still need more practice. However, the contols aren't complicated in the least so people willing to invest a little time into the game are bound to unlock more satisfaction than the intial frustration that may come during the early sessions.  This game isn't perfect. It could use a little more depth like a deeper managerial aspect. However everything that's in Brigador is top notch.   I'll leave you with a phrase that sounds foreign to my Steam filled ears. Brigador feels like a bargain even at full price.  ",

Brigador does have a steep learning curve, but, once you get into it, you'll love it. Also, the developers have added some additional control options, so make sure to try them out if you're struggling.  The story is interesting and nuanced, without being too heavy handed. If you want to bust through walls without thinking, Brigador's got you. If you want to sneak and snipe, that can work too. If you just want to blow up everything in sight, play this game.  I can't wait to see what these devs do in the future.",
