But after seeing how good this is developed and how hard the people at UTAH worked on this, i have to say... It's amazing. So i believe i am the first review on steam and I'm giving it a thumbs up!  Keep in mind i haven't played for so long yet i still think it's amazing!",

It is nearly impossible to avoid most obstacles, probably totally impossible in some songs and every time you hit one the music slows down to a near halt and gradually speeds back up, ruining your enjoyment of the music. A music based game isn't much cop if you can't even enjoy the music... A good option to add might be a (Lock speed) button so it plays a tad more like Audiosurf. Add the scratches, filtering and other effects when obstacles are hit, sure but keep the music playing at the right speed.",

Controls are fair and simple, and being able to add songs to the game is an awesome feature that doesn't say 'Pay us money for more songs via dlc'.  It's just nothing you'll play for long; The visuals are all over the place, and it really doesn't look nice in many areas. Has a weird twitch to the camera as it (tries to) go with the beat of the song. You can add your own music but really doesn't do anything different, and it doesn't seem to match the environment with the music. Just seems off when your playing; why is there a hill at that point? What makes those different points occur at that time? This game may give you headaches and blurry vision after looking at it for so long.  As I said though; great job by the students who created it. Hope they learn something from what is being said by people and use it in the future.  Since I have to give a recommendation; I'm gonna put 'no', but give it a go. You can't loss anything from it..... except maybe your health.....",

Honestly , i wouldnt recommend the game because of the bad layout of the game , the 'graphics' suck , i dont think theres a fullscreen , a HUD remake would be great , but theres the great part :  -You can add your own music.  -You can play against your friends to get a better highscore.  -Compete with Skilled players ( by highscores ) .  -Kind of satisfying when you finish a run without failing at all.  -Its free.  -No extra payment/microtransactions or hidden fees.   Devs , if youre seeing this , the only thing this game needs is better graphics ( Menu and the rest of the buttons ) , HUD replacement and a nice workshop to add your own music and see whos better at it. ( this would be my needs )   Well , might not be possible because money meh... but atleast try :D",

It runs weirdly and is really really all around terrible, anywhere from the graphics to the actual gameplay. 1.5/10, I would suggest this to that one 'friend' who isn't really a friend that everyone hates, not worth the 17 minutes I spent on it.",

            "review_text": "I found the idea of being able to change the genre of a song while playing the game to be incredibly intriguing, and easily the most unique feature of this game, and hey it's free so why not?  Honestly I cannot recommend this game to anyone to spend any time on whatsoever.  To start with, it takes absolutely ages to get it working. It seemed to crash multiple times during the initial load and then while trying to import music. Some songs it DID crash upon importing. It also seems to have inconsistent rules about what file types are okay. Seemingly .mp3 files, but many of them I tried either did not show up in the file browser or caused a crash everytime I tried to import them.  The game itself is basically a free to play version of Audiosurf, with much the same gameplay (though reversed - here you mostly avoid obstacles and collect a few, which is the opposite of Audiosurf) and a similar graphical style (mostly just the color scheme) but it's not as smooth and the graphics are very basic. There is a glow effect placed on all of the obstacles that seems to grow in intensity as the songs continue, so that by the end of a song your eyes will be hurting and you'll just want it to stop. It is the best way to make yourself acutely aware of how long a song is.  As for the genre switching, it's a novel concept and I was extremely disappointed to find that what it means, basically, is EQ. Really horrible EQ that will make the song a pain to listen to. No bass, ALL THE BASS IN THE WORLD, or barely perceptible changes that somehow result in a lot of clipping audio. A few of the 'genres' also provide sounds like drum beats and record scratches and though they seem roughly in time with the music they don't actually add anything and are just kind of there. The most that changing 'genre' does is change the texture of the track, which is nice, I guess, if it didn't come with those unfortunate side-effects.  It's also nearly impossible to tell what genre the settings are supposed to represent. The hand doing devil horns is probably metal, okay, and I guess the treble cleff is perhaps classical (despite the fact that it seemed to add the most bass out of all of them), but what does the vague rainbow icon mean? Or the microphone? I have absolutely no clue.  If you're looking for a fun rhythm game to kill half an hour in, just buy Audiosurf. It's cheap. You will not regret the few extra dollars required to play that rather than this. There is simply nothing in here worth recommending.  Though it does come with a Beastie Boys song pre-imported, so that's cool I guess?",

            "review_text": "Fun Game to Jam your favourite songs on. It has that same object-mechanics as 'Flappy Bird'. Sometimes it feels like you dodged, but in reality you didn't. Also Movement Progression could be better. However, the rewind feature/ability was a nice touch to counter these two things.  Pros: You can add your own songs (Supported Format) , Fun, Free and somewhat addicting. Cons: Music effects ruins the music while using abilities. Not a lot of variety when it comes to the content itself.",
