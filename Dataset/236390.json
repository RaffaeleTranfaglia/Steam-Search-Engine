            "review_text": "Don't be fooled by the high ratings of this game. As soon as you play for a longer time you will see the massive racism of the developers and sheer cheek of their pay2win greed.  +The game is pretty This is it.. it looks good and runs well. The only + in this review.  -Russian bias It's real, its totally real. Russian planes outright outperform lots of other planes and russian tanks downright deflect shells with magic armor. No surprise the developers are russian. Their response to the bias is that they have 'Secret documents' about WW2, probably saying Russia had magic infused armor made from Stalin's bumsweat and nosehair. Time and time again the community has provided declassified documents themselves, disproving the armor effectiveness and certain nerfs on especially germans, from MANY countries, even CCCP but devs/mods just ignore it/delete it.  I would also like to add that Steam moderators have CONFIRMED that russian bias exists about a month ago from writing this review.   -Pay2Win Certain vehicles are behind a paywall going up to 60 euro a vehicle sometimes. These are blatantly better than their free counterparts on the same rating. Special armor, non-exploding fueltanks, the list goes on. But most irritating are the rocketlaunching tanks. The Callioppe for instance has 60 rockets mounted ontop of a Sherman, each rocket is DEVASTATING for other tanks downright riddling the crew with shrapnel. Add to that a insanely high RoF and a 10 second reload speed. Also the rockets cannot be taken out by shooting the canisters. No surprise its a 50 euro tank.  -Map Design Partially to blame for the russian bias is the map design. Most maps are made specifically for close range brawler tanks ( russian ) and aircombat always at a low enough altitude to 'justify' the russian superiority as russian planes were best at low altitudes ( below 5 km ). Spawn camping is easily done as you only need to do a small drive of about 30 seconds on certain maps to be in enemy spawn. You have a brief spawnprotection but thats void as soon as you're alive for a few seconds. You drive out of spawn then and boom, someone shot you in your side who was hiding in a bush/behind a rock next to your spawn.  -Battle Rating The most agrivating and full on bias thing to exist in War Thunder. Vehicles are classed by a Battle Rating ( BR ) as to balance the matches so a lategame heavy tanks wont face 1920's tanks.  This is broken, there is no way around it.  Russian vehicles have favorable BR's to their opponents. Purposely classed lower than what theyre actually worth so they decimate other countries. ( Also outperforming specialised turnfighters with a flying russian brick and magic armor ) How it is supposed to work is your highest vehicle will be chosen and put into a match with +/-1 BR or 1.3 in planes. Seeing as i fight BR 3.3 tanks in my 1.3 tanks, I cannot kill anything.  -Developers As said earlier they are racist towards anything what isn't russian. Disregarding anyone not speaking russian as less important. Deleting and banning alot of feedback on their own forum and having Steammods delete any negative feedback. Steammods also actively downvote negative reviews reportedly. Also I think Gaijin spies on what you say via bots as I myself have been banned from chat while ONLY talking in Squadchat with my friends, badmouthing Gaijin. 15 day chatban for hate messages. Only hate against Gaijin though. Giving russian vehicles magic abilities, nerfing all other countries to oblivion (mostly germans), banning and deleting community for feedback and having a MASSIVE P2W mentality with 50 euro blatantly overpowered vehicles.  Edit: Gaijin forced a youtuber to delete a video he made with footage showing a hacker. They do not want the world to see they cannot handle hackers.  Shame Gaijin, shame. We complain to you because we want to see a good WW2 game but all you do is hide behind your nationalism and hate on us.  Also alot of members of the community are toxic.",

            "review_text": "War Thunder is fun, well-developed, and addicting. I hardly have any complaints about the game itself, which makes it a shame that I can no longer even stand it.   The moderators of this game are the WORST I've ever encountered ANYWHERE, and that's against every website, forum, or game I've had an account on since the age of Dial-Up. The false sense of superiority and lack of basic respect that these Mods exhibit is as angering as the amount of hours I've sunk into a game that I am no longer able to play. I am still in disbelief that EVERY moderator has blown me off, with the exception of the one that replied just so he could call me a Nazi. His empty accusation isn't just offensive, but it's pathetic. I am not a Nazi and I never represented myself to be in any fashion, the mod simply formed an opinion based on my German username and refuses to believe anything different. I have been nothing but pleasant to every moderator, even offering an explanation and a solution to the man who insulted me. Unfortunately, I have received nothing but disrespect in return from the people who are refusing to reinstate my account.  The bottom line is that Gaijin needs to increase their standards of who they accept as moderators before they lose even more players. You can have a perfect game, but no one will play if the people representing the game are rude and demeaning.",

            "review_text": "after 500+ hours on this game i can honestly say that i dont reccomend it. As much as it pains me to say that, in the current state the game is absolutely broken, especially german tanks and planes. The german planes are broken, and the german tanks are underpowered and completely outmatched by their american and russian counterparts, and the recent update to the BR system means that uptiered rank III and IV tanks get to fight russian T-10M's and IS-4's with 120mm of armor on all sides and literally unpennable from the front. all while the starting german tier V tanks arent even that good, starting tanks on that tier are the 10.5cm Tiger II (a Tiger II (H) with a slightly bigger gun), Panther II (Panther F with a slightly bigger gun), Coelion (SPAA so useless against most tanks anyways) and the Jagdtiger (Tiger II without a rotating turret and a bigger gun) which are literally no different from their tier IV counterparts besides the armament, meaning that you can be detonated with the force of a thousand suns from any direction, while you cant pen anything from the front unless its a light tank. The planes are also unbearable because of how slow the german planes turn, it takes close to 25 seconds to make a full 360 degree turn in the fockewolf, while the BF is better its still slow, you simply cant keep up with the meanuverability of other planes and as a result you are always killed. Russian planes are overpowered, shooting gigantic rounds that detonate your plane instantaniously if it hits your plane. As much as i want this game to be good it just isnt anymore, untill the devs get their ♥♥♥♥ together I cant reccomend this game.",

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER Played WT via the launcher +300 hours, just downloaded it here to write review I also solemnly swear to be as unbiased as I can and will try to see the good in every human  End of disclaimer  General:  I will start with this. I love WW2 themed simulator games. When i first joined up War thunder almost 3 years ago, it looked very promising. This was the first (♥♥♥ you Wowp) decent flight-sim/arcade that looked decent in a long time. War thunder is certainly a pleasure for the eye, worthy of the latest graphical standards set to date.   Progression:  Do you want to fly the most epic post war jets?  Do you want to know what it is like to fly an me262, hunter of the late war skies?  Do you want to drive those legendary king tigers and Pershings?  WELL TOO BAD!! (or pay up)  Progression is nonexistent. The grind is SO terrible that it if WW2 had Gajin mechanics we would still be flying biplanes to this day. The first tiers are okay i guess. But starting from mid tier 3 , things get grindy fast. An average match in planes gets you about 1400 rp and with tanks even lower than that (excluding boosters). When you need to research this plane/tank you want and its 75k rp or more, you are about to pull your hair out. Things get worse as you progress, as you are grinding your way through 5464 of the same planes with almost no real difference between them. Really, do we need to have 20 types of bf109, 25 types of yak and 57 types of spitfire? god please. Yeeeyy i just grinded a 89k spit for 3 months only to find out that the stock version of that plane is ten times worse that your spaded spit you used to get it. THE STOCK GRIND IS ♥♥♥ WRECKING. You have to be a masochist to enjoy this. If you like wasting your time and effort, like playing for weeks/months for minimal reward, you will be thrilled by this game. Unless you pay... Yes i do realize there is alot of difference between an bf109 F2 and a G2...  Balancing:  The BR system was invented by a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ platypus. You face plane/tanks that are + 1.3 - 1.3 compared to you. However, most of the time its + - 2.3...  For example: If I used a plane of BR 3.3, you are constantly matched by planes up to 5.3 or more. Happened 5 times this week alone. I suppose the gajin-lovers among you think this is impossible and will whine to try to prove their point.The BR system is broken as f***. Unless you pay... BR distribution is foul as well. Certain german tanks/planes and japanese planes face things they should not.. which  brings us flawlessly to the next point.  Bias:  Gajin has said there is no bias countless times. However, there just is. Tanks: The T34 and to extend the T34-85, is the single most OP tank in Gajin history, able to block shells from Tigers, Panthers and occasional King tiger. Deflection shells can happen of course, but when A T34-85 block 5 shells of a Tiger to the rear with no damage, uses his supersonic turret traverse speed to turn to you and one-shot you through the thickest part of your armor (NOT IN A WEAK SPOT) at a 30° angle, I just call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. KV's and Su's have this too, but not to the UBER-MOTHERLAND-PRIDELY way of the T34. Conclusion, don't play tanks unless you use a russian tank. Preferably a T34 or variants. If you really do have to play another nation, which isn't recommended for your mental sanity, use 50 - 60 ducks premium pay wall tanks of the Germans or Americans.   Planes: Not as bad as the bias in tanks. The real problem with planes (RB) is the over-preforming UFO's like the I185. Also the big spread on the BR causes poor lower tier germans to face higher Pay to win russian premium P63 noobs.  Pro's: - Swordfish  - Exit button  - AFK climbing  - Low intelligence level players, being easily offended or fooled.  - 1 byte/sec download speed gives you time to do the chores of the house  CONCLUSION: I would write down a lot more, but please refer to Crabman's review for additional information.   Only three ways to fully enjoy this game:  - be a pro russian rebel, with a secret shrine to Gajin and Stalin in his cellar, while doing ritual sacrifice on innocent germans. Preferably well spoken, as you need to carry out Gajin's orders on how to mute the critics of this game. Be prepared to crush the dreams of others. One day, Gajin might send you a hair of Stalins moustache as a reward.  - Be a millionaire and spend over 500 bucks on this game to get every single premium plane, soviets preferred, and buy 10 years of premium time.  - be mentally unstable, and enjoy to cause pain to yourself and are ready to face depression.

            "review_text": "This game has great potential, yet the Russian makers are extremely bias for their own country.   Before 1.53, it was okay, but afterwards, the power of the German tanks has utterly been demolished. the German 88 mm gun has virtually no affect on the Russian tanks, bouncing off T-34's front slope if not placed correctly. The Russian tanks however, seem to dominate the game, with one-shots on nearly every single tank they come accross.  A few years ago (before War Thunder groundforces) the American faction was experiencing the same problems. The American planes had extremely low max speeds such as the Hellcat having a max speed of 200 km/h. This was made note of many of War Thunder's fans and eventurely, (although not completely) War Thunder made American planes somewhat more operable.  Hopefully by next update War Thunder won't make such another mistake, although it is unlikely.",

            "review_text": "I have a very love-hate realtionship with War Thunder. Before I had a decent computer, this was the game that I looked forward to getting most. Hands down. When I got the game at last, I was very pleased.  The game looks fantastic. It performs incredibly well, especially considering the graphical quality and size of the maps. Additionally, outside of a few premium vehicles, there is very little pay-to-win. Unlike World of Tanks, you cannot buy special ammunition or consumables. I cannot think of a single aspect of the gameplay itself that is bad. In fact, I can think of little in that respect that is even mediocre.  So why not recommend it? 2 main things, that, between the two, ruin the game for me.  The matchmaking. Basically the balancing entirely. The recent introduction of mouse-guided ATGMs on (Surprise!) a Soviet tank broke late tier tank balancing. Similarly, there are age-old and unadressed issues with certain armor models, unrealistic shell performance, etc. that just make the game a nightmare for certain vehicles. Throw on top the bush camos that are just way too good. Even air forces has major problems. The addition of a (Surprise!) Soviet bomber that is basically the Death Star completely ruin my desire to keep grinding to the high tiers.  Along with balancing is the age-old issue of Russian (aka Soviet) bias on the part of the devs. Certain vehicles are and always have been completely overperforming. This transcends modes, but it is the worst in Ground Forces. Vehicles have balancing that just makes no sense, or have unrealistic performance that is not fixed by the devs. And I don't even know what they thought with some of the early Soviet planes. Do they obey physics? I con't tell, but I'm not entirely sure.  Throw on top of that the fact that, to account for shrinking player numbers, they compress the MM (which in turn means fewer players. No one saw that coming!) means that some battles are cases of give up, go back to the garage, and try again.  The second gripe is Gaijin Entertainment themselves. Not only do they make decisions that seem baffling (see 'mouse-guided ATGMs') but they behave in an almost authoritarian way. I seriously wonder if they know that this is the 21st century. They silence criticizm, they ban players, they have forum moderators that behave like kings on a self-built throne, it's atrocious. Never use their forums. Just don't. You'll be banned or your thread blocked if you do as much as fromn at Gaijin.  I would say get the game for Naval Forces. I still will give it a second chance. However, my optimism is running out. In Naval Forces, I thought, was a place where the Japanese could be exceptional at something (they have no tanks yet and few aircraft), where the Soviets would not be as much of a problem. Where we could finally have land, air AND sea.  Instead we get boats. I am preparing for Russian Bias as stong as the rest of their game, possibly worse. Broken machines, broken mechanics, terrible MM, and even more opportunities for these developers to pretend Gorbachev is still in power.  Maybe if they sell the game to someone else, it could be fixed. It still has some of the INCREDIBLE potential that this game had in the beginning.  P.S. I thought I already made a review, but it is possible Gaijin had it removed. If so I rest my case, and take that 'Mostly Positive' as nothing more that a Gaijin advertisement.",

You can check my in-game profile under the same nickname. Long story short:  - great engine, controls and graphics  - Matchmaking is frustrating and unfair due to the +/- 1.0/1.6 spread which probably favours Premium accounts. Population can allow for better.  - Ratings can be improved. But they mostly won't be.  - Russian bias is a fact, anyone denying there is one is being dishonest, deal with it. It has been multiple times uncovered by able players in game data, with bloated coefficient favoring russian models and ammo. Gaijin sometimes buffs foreign units to momentary overpower just to say 'that's stronk, there no russian bias, see? )))) ' but that's not balance, it's a poor excuse for one. Meanwhile, T34s dominate with 10x the kills of other tanks and Yaks/Lavochkins are UFOs firing turbolasers. They were very good designs, severely damaged by inexperience and industrial faults, but the models that made their way into the game are just silly. Bias leads to outright nationalist cheating as it extends to filtering historical sources and crew manuals until we have discarded 'nazi propaganda' and unshared 'sikrit dokumentz, comrade'.  If Gaijin keeps on their tracks, we'll soon have articles telling the tale of the glorious motherland who singlehandedly defeated the krauts with flying tanks and absolutely no help from the cowardly allies.  You can read plenty of stuff about this on the forums.  - Speaking of which, the dev team NEVER answers the pesky questions and instead players face the incredibly arrogant and downright jerks composing the moderating team who ban players posting perfectly legit questions or inconvenient historical sources. This is ridiculous customer care.  It could be an awesome game. It is not. Not because the devs can't fix it but because they don't want to. 6/10 would NOT be forced into playing soviets again.",

            "review_text": "While playing this game it occured to me that the more time i spent partaking in the tedium, and the grind, the less fun i had. Initially, tank fights were very fun to play - an experience (one of few) i was able to take away from this game that was positive. It was simple - you shoot them and they shoot you.   As i ascended in the ranks of both russia and US tanks (3.0-5.0), that same ideal stayed relativley intact; some tanks became more armoured than others but it wasn't impossible to kill them and a miracle shot wasn't something unheard of. There were clear trade offs with the tanks - Some offered more speed with a better gun, but less armour as a whole. Some were more armoured with decent speed but a crappier gun, and it goes on. No tank was without weakness in major areas, and the areas were very clear. This added a bit of interesting gameplay and it helped me learn how to turn my tanks in certain ways to block shots, or where to shoot tanks to get the maximum amount of damage and i reveled in that. It was interesting gamplay, and it was very immersive. I had spent a large portion of my time playing War Thunder at this metaphorical 'sweet spot'.   Then i got my first 5.7 tank and i started to get matched with 6.0 and 6.3. An occasional 6.7 would appear, as well. I would position myself no different than before and die instantly. I would fire away at tanks shot after shot, trying so desperatley to find a place to hit but die quickly after i was spotted after causing minimal damage. Most times, i would find fair matches but it was also the unfair matches i remember most vividly. I kept telling myself that once I was on equal ground, it would be more fun again. It kept me going to repeat that.   Then i got my first 6.0 tank. Long gone were the times where i could just shoot at other tanks and cause damage. I was finding myself dying over and over even though i had been doing nothing different than before. Constanty dying to a single shot even though my shots never got the chance to even penetrate. When i did get a kill, it wasn't satisfying. It felt owed to me - and after spending the better part of 10-15 minutes driving my slow tank, i felt that it should've too.  After some research on why my performance has suffered so badly, i learned that the game completley changes at 6.0+ with no warning to it's players. Instead of having huge killzones, tanks now had tiny weak spots to shoot and you were damned if you couldn't hit them. Some tanks were still thinly armored with guns equal to those of the slow cumbersome variety. There was no way to win for me but to sit and ambush or invest in these tanks that demanded tedium to drive. If i managed to get to a shooting zone that was profitable for me, I ended up getting bombed.  The game was stale. It wasn't fun to play anymore. The tanks - they were wildly cool. As an enthusiast, i was thrilled at the idea of getting to drive them. It's unfortunate that the game becomes so unbearable at the higher tiers becuase i was really looking forward to playing a simple tank game like it was when i started. I wanted more than World of Tanks... but i also wanted less than the complexity this offered. I only hope that in the future they make a balancing pass at the game. And i sure hope that the ships don't come out like this did.   I havent even started on the grinding process of this game. You will  not  get far without premium or a tank that costs money.",

Their system for the relative matchmaking between vehicles (their 'Battle Rating') is only initially based on expected performance, and is then ONLY based on player statistics. If players do bad in a plane it means the plane is bad and should get lower BR to get easier opponents, with absolutely zero investigation into WHY the plane does bad.  Couple that with strange ideas like low graphics quality completely removing some graphical entities from tank battles (like some types of bushes) and the CEO effectively insulting anyone that thinks it is a bad system to not make the world representation at least have the same objects rendered in different quality of graphics and you are in for a fun time.  Their interaction with the community is basically to tell us to give feedback, and then completely ignoring absolutely everything that's said. At the odd occasion that they don't completely ignore it they just completely misinterpret it and destroy the game that way instead.  It is tragic that the above happens, because the game's ENGINE is excellent, and the game has an enormous potential, but the management at Gaijin is so incompetent that calling them 'monkeys' is an insult to actual monkeys worldwide.  Gaijin doesn't treat this as a game. They are simply milking it on money for all they're worth, and seem to treat it more as a test-bed for developing a game engine. How fun the game is is completely irrelevant as the code works on a technical level.  There is no question about if they'll ever get the game on its feet.

Graphics are well rounded and can play on even a mediocre PC. It looks absolutely stunning at max details, but it will give you a severe handicap when trying to spot enemy tanks.  Now for the bad; The playerbase is absolutely terrible. Roughly half of players in this game do not understand the mechanics and seem too preoccupied with (trying) getting kills and thus tend to ignore the mission at hand, which will ultimately garner you a loss in the end. While the game doesn't reward winners and punish losers like in similar games, it is still quite demoralizing to lose ten or more matches in a row, because your teammates are running around like headless chickens.  Another concern is the abundance of russian players on the european servers. They refuse to use english and tend to teamkill you when you don't understand a word of what they're saying. From what I've heard, it is because the russian server is even more toxic to play on, so they go to the european server instead.  Russian bias; it exists in the form of favorable battle rating for russian tanks. There is no denying this.  Community: The community is congruent to poison and Gaijin is more focused on punishing than listening. It looks like Gaijin is actively trying to sabotage the community and what good is left of it, is slowly fading with each ban.  Bugs: A lot of bugs have been introduced over the course of the last two major updates - don't expect to have a good time, as wonky physics, horrible ballistic collision and missing tank interior will ruin your day.  Half a year ago I would definitely have recommended this game - not so much any more. Warthunder is slowly turning into a rotting cesspool of biased game design, bugs, horrible player management and blatant disregard of community feedback.  TL;DR: Don't get this game, just don't - you will regret it. It will seem fun at first, but then it will suck out your soul and leave your dried salty husk to write bad reviews.",

I'll be discussing the flying portion as I have the most experience with it.  The primary issue here is that the devs are Russian, and like all Russian devs who make WWII games the commie propaganda shines through heavily and the Russian bias is extremely tangible, either due to national pride clouding the devs' honesty or them being force fed Red Army propaganda as children.   The key to having fun in this game is extremely simple: ignore Russians entirely. Don't play maps that pit you against Russians, and you'll have few complaints. The other factions balance well against each other, but compared to the flying saucer-tier unrealistic flight models of the Soviet Air Force(whose real life achievements include the worst kill-death ratio in World War II, the most plane crashes in the war, and probably the most pilots flying under the influence of alcohol), you'll find yourself raging out due to blatant imbalancing to favor Russian players and Russian planes(like pitting post-war Russian aircraft models against early/pre war German/Japanese/British/American ones, which is extremely prevalent in the first three tiers but consistent throughout the Russian aircraft tree). A good way to test the insane imbalance is by starting the game as a non-Russian faction, and then picking up the Russian tree after you've learned the ropes to experience maximum seal clubbing as you can climb sharper, dive faster and turn quicker than anything else in the game.  The secondary issue is that these devs have added many types and classes of aircraft to the game, and any that aren't fighters or interceptors(70% of the aircraft models in this game) don't serve a purpose or benefit their team in any way. Bombers/ground attackers/fighters that focus on ground targets are nothing but a liability to/drag on their team and dog chow for opposing fighter aircraft. They do not serve a purpose in game modes that end 95% of the time in team wipes, even though there are ostensibly mission objectives for bombers to complete that almost never get done.  Flying anything that isn't an air superiority fighter is choosing to play 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'. Fighting Russians in anything that isn't Russian(with few exceptions) is also playing 'Getting Shot Down Simulator WW2'.  The Russian bias, wonky flight models/characteristics and horribly imbalanced game modes bring my score for this game from a solid 7/10 to a 5/10. As it basically still in 'active beta' release, I cannot recommend it until it is more polished and the devs learn English well enough to read their forums. If you DO play it, please don't give these devs any money.",

            "review_text": "Simply put: I don't have such love/hate relationship with any other game than I have with War Thunder. Also no other game has made me more salty than War Thunder.  That said I'll list some pros and cons.  Pros: -Different levels of realism from shooty-tooty arcade to much slower paced simulator battles -Lots of tanks and airplanes to unlock and new ones are constantly added -Very nice graphics -Free to play but not win to pay -Does actually require some skill, especially later in game  Cons: -Realism is sometimes more like 'realism', tanks ricocheting rounds in very weird way OR taking damage when they really shouldn't etc -There are lots of stuff to unlock but sometimes you'll notice that vehicles are very similiar. For example when unlocking american tanks you'll spend ages grinding through three different Shermans that aren't actually that different from each other after all. (Slight changes to armour thickness etc, don't really mean anything) And that's just one example. -Technically it's still pay to win, War Thunder has this premium system that gives you different kind of boosters to use and also provides you with a selection of premium vehicles. Not all of them are that special but some of them are seriously unbalanced and overpowered. -Does require skill but still most of the time it seems that it's not enough. Game suffers from serious balancing problems and therefore some matches end in minutes no matter how good of an player you are.  Some other things that need to be noted: Game has this Battle rating system or BR in short. This means that every vehicle has a rating, for example 3.7. Game then searches for players with same BR. Thing is that usually you have more than just one vehicle. Lets say you have three tanks with BR of 3.7. Things are good and you're having pretty evenly balanced games. Then you get a tank with BR of 4.3 Suddenly you're facing tanks that have BR of 5 or even higher. This leads to greatly unbalanced game. Also because of this game doesn't always feel rewarding. For example I grinded for some time to get legendary Tiger and Panther tanks but after I got them I really didn't feel like playing with them because I was fighting more advanced (prototype or post-WW2 era tanks) most of the time. That also takes away some realism.  Spawncamping. Yes, I do it sometimes myself too but still. Too often I see games where one team steamrolls to other teams spawn and kills everyone. Some maps even make it very easy by having the spawn points on open ground and easily seen from across the map. Already unbalnaced games become even more unbalnced because of this.  Lack of teamwork. It's extremely rare to see some real teamwork in WT unless you're playing with friends or are part of some clan. There are lots of russian players even on EU servers and they don't usually speak english and even less usually they give a ♥♥♥♥ about other players. Not saying that they all are like that, just like 80% of them...  Game modes don't really force you to be a team player. Okay maybe it's bit wrong to rant about this but I still want to point it out. With tanks game modes usually require player to capture and hold some point on the map. Even though you do get a reward for capturing a point and you do get more points and currency if you win a match it doesn't force you to play the objective or be a team player. WT would be a lot more fun with new game modes etc, maybe there will be some in the future.   All in all, War Thunder is somewhat hooking even though sometimes it makes you really salty. You might like it or not or perhaps you'll be like me and feel both ways. I chose not to recommend this game because right now it feels unbalanced and broken, maybe I'll change my mind after a while. Or maybe not.   ",

I've been playing from the launch of this game, and it has been a rollercoaster ride of fun, it runs fast on my pc, and there are no other flight games quite like it. Sadly, Gaijin are a bunch of idiots. They ruin the game by being abusive to their community, and displaying downright abhorent behavior toward their content creators. Russian bias is existant, but not as bad as it used to be, The Russians have the best jet and best tank, but all the midteir stuff is fine. The game has become more and more grindy has the years have gone by, and grinding out a tank is a month long process for me. The meta of the game makes no sence. You are rewarded more for killing other players, but for some reason that has almost no corrilation to winning the game. Also, a tutorial would not go amiss, as new players typically have no idea how basic game mechanics work, even at high teirs there are people that don't understand how to win a game or shoot down planes, or fight in general. Perhaps most annoying however is the fact that the CEO of Gaijin seems to think that abusing YouTube copyright rules are a solution to a very small group of hackers. There are bigger fish for Gaijin to fry, and hackers should be the least of the companies concerns at the moment. To sum up, the game is spectacular, it looks great, and its fun to fly and drive World War Two machines and fly with friends. However, I cannot recommend this game due to the fact that Gaijin are a bunch of idiots and they seem to be uninterested in their community and the state of their game. Don't start playing, you'll be lured in by the first few battles, then you find yourself at odds with Gaijin, and you'll care to much to stop playing, but hate every time you get on to get your spin to fly a few. I still have a glimmer of hope that Gaijin will pull their heads out of their asses and make this game live up to it's potential, and thats the only reason I play still..... What a shame",

For starters, once you enter tier 3 ground forces, the grind becomes unbelievably long and tedious. Even the modifications you have to research take quite a while, and it sucks that the game hinders you until you unlock these modifications. For example, not having parts or FPE can really screw you over, but if you play careful you should be fine. The problem lies with having to research adjustment of fire and the elevation mechanism. Your gun will be inaccurate as all hell until you research these two, which again is very frustrating. The whole battle rating system is confusing and unfair (Tiger E going against Tiger II's and T-44's when your line up is a Tiger E, H1, and a pz4 g). Some maps seems to favor certain spawnpoints, and the game can be a load of horsecrap sometimes with the gameplay. My main problem is the developers tactic of ignoring their community and making it nothing more than a money grabber pay to win game. And when I say pay to win, I dont mean buying premium tanks, I mean having to pay money to speed up a tedious research system.

            "review_text": "I don't usually write reviews for games, but in this case I will make an exception so as to lend my considerable time spent playing War Thunder to the decision-making process.  First on the agenda is the ever-present complaint of 'Russian Bias' or, as it's more popularly known, 'I suck at this game so I'm going to complain that the nation the company is based in is OP.' Seriously, if there is any Bias in this game whatsoever, it has been mitigated over time by the inclusion of more vehicles for other nations and the refinement of the game mechanics. Furthermore, this game is HIGHLY skill-based, which means you need to get good to do good if you play any mode other than Arcade. While this may require a time investment, it does pay off by providing the player with a FAR more rewarding gameplay experience than anything Wargaming could shovel out of their pit of despair.   I must, however, concede that the game DID have bias when it first came onto Steam, of that there is no doubt. However, since then other nations have been added to the game and the game mechanics (such as spalling, armor deflection, and ammunition properties) have been refined further and further. At this point, the only Russian Bias that might exist has to do with their aircraft, but I'm not familiar with that situation personally because I predominantly play tanks. In the case of tanks, I can confidently say that Bias is virtually nonexistent as Russian tanks are easy enough to knock out if you know what you're doing. Also, the Panther's gun eats T-34's alive because its shell normalization is so good.  Speaking of shells, you recall when I said that to do good, you had to get good? This includes learning what ammunition types do what and, especially in the case of Sim battles, learning what tanks belong to which nation. When it comes to ammunition and its capabilities, it pays dividends to know that APCBC rounds are more capable of defeating sloped armor than APCR. The first thing to remember is that this isn't World of Tanks, and APCR in War Thunder isn't the magical 'I win' button it is in World of Tanks. Furthermore, it pays off to know that loading a full load of ammunition is not actually a bad thing. Yes there are MANY people who will tell you otherwise, and in some tanks I admit that it may be true that loading a diminished load of ammo is actually a good idea, but if you are even halfway decent at War Thunder, you'll notice that you're surviving longer and running out of ammo when you really don't need to if you do load a minimal supply. It's details like this that make War Thunder so good; it makes the player think, and therefore makes them better teammates.  Moving on, let's talk about the devs shall we? Gaijin has been notorious in the past for ignoring their community and doing what they damn well please with War Thunder, and to an extent that is still true, but at the same time Gaijin HAS been making an active effort to pay more attention to what they're community says. On the one hand, I'm happy they're paying attention, there are problems that do need to be resolved. On the other hand, I'm EXTREMELY happy they continue to ignore the community for the most part. Why would I be happy about this you ask? Well, for one, the majority of the War Thunder community plays Arcade, which is just...not War Thunder's main mode, no matter what anyone may tell you. Unfortunately, the fact that the majority of the playerbase plays Arcade means that they tend to complain about game mechanics and balance that are really quite alright, and some of the REALLY hardcore elements tend to zealously campaign against the existence of Realistic Battles and Simulator Battles. I personally believe that Arcade is not War Thunder's main mode, it still feels tacked-on even after all the TLC that Gaijin has given it, but despite that I do feel it is a necessary evil as the mode keeps the most toxic and bigoted elements of the community contained.  Speaking of the community, it's not as bad as some people say it is. Yes, it does have it's fair share of idiots and toxic trolls, but they are not as prevalent as many would lead you to believe.  For those who may be interested, the graphics in this game are fantastic, easily besting World of Tanks or *shudders* World of Warplanes in graphical fidelity. The sound design is also quite good, with the tanks actually sounding like tanks and the planes, for the most part, sounding like planes. You still have the odd flying lawnmower and tank with the wrong engine audio, but those are easily ignored in the face of everything else.  Let's see, what have we missed? Ah, yes, the 'issue' of 'bad balance' that you see so many people complain about. I'm going to be brutally honest and say that I could not give Two ♥♥♥♥♥ if the game was actually unbalanced or not. I personally believe that if a game is unbalanced, it provides the player in a supposedly disadvantageous position a real challenge, and a chance to really shine as a player who knows what they're doing. I commonly say that there are no bad tanks, only bad tankers, and this game really demonstrates that by requiring a player to practice good situational awareness and intelligent decision-making. The game is one of those few MMO's that actually rewards good players for being good, though good fortune still factors in like it would in reality.  There are other reasons to enjoy War Thunder as well. Gaijin has created a detailed and comprehensive custom battles system that allows players to create entirely custom matches with settings of their own preference. This has allowed entire player-run tournaments to be created with special rule sets and custom vehicle lineups. That's not all however, as Gaijin has added the ability for players to create entirely custom scenarios in which the creator of a scenario can edit virtually anything about it. If you want to recreate the battle of Kursk down to every detail, you can. Unfortunately, the custom scenario's system is still single-player only, but Gaijin recently announced that they are actively working on making the system multiplayer-capable, meaning players would be able to create, upload, and host entirely custom battles with things like forced ammunition loads, vehicle choices, and preset trigger events. You could recreate the Normandy invasion if you wanted, complete with offshore bombardment, AT guns, Infantry, and specific tank spawn locations.  Some people will commonly complain about the number of premium tanks in the game, but those people also forget that Gaijin has to fund development of the game in some way, and the prices for premium tanks and Golden Eagles is actually quite reasonable compared to the way Wargaming extorts you.  I could go much deeper into reviewing the game, but I think I've made the majority of the better points towards downloading War Thunder and giving it a go. I highly recommend this game, and I suggest that you give all game modes a try before you pronounce it terrible and give it up. Every game has its flaws, and War Thunder is no different, but the game is being actively developed by a developer that is learning to communicate with its community more than it used to. Not only that, but the game offers a truly unique experience that doesn't subject itself to the whims of RNGesus as often as health bar based games. It is possible to get one-shot in this, but that feeling of blowing a tank sky-high with one shot of your own is something I have only ever felt in this game. War Thunder is unique, and I hope it doesn't conform to what other MMO's are doing just because they're so Arcadey and successful because of it.",

            "review_text": "Now that War Thunder is officially released as of update 1.65, I figured I should probably get around to writing a review. This is the state of the game as of 12/20/16.   War Thunder is a free to play vehicular combat game for PC and PS4, commonly described as an MMO. It's not an open world and there isn't one massive server with thousands of players playing side by side in the same battle, so I don't know if that's really an apt description though. The range of aircraft spans from just before World War II to the Korean War. The range of ground vehicles is from just before World War II to the Vietnam War.   Players face off against eachother in teams of 16 versus 16. Airplanes have three modes: Arcade, Realistic, and Simulator. Arcade is just that, and the mode most players should begin with. Most pilots fly with a mouse and keyboard in third person view, with a crosshair and lead indicator to help target enemies. Players can win a match by bombing out the enemy base, shooting down all enemy aircraft, or destroying all of the AI ground targets. Flight models are simplified and an instructor is present, meaning all planes of the same class (bomber, fighter, etc) perform relatively similarly and the computer will help you fly, eg, controlling the rudder in turns. Matches are typically ~10 minutes. Realistic battles have the same objectives, but the maps are much larger, flight models are not simplified (though an instructor is still present), and players must take off at the beginning of each match rather than spawning in the air. No lead indicator is present, and less HUD elements are present as well. A more comprehensive spotting system is included. Matches are typically 30-40 minutes long. In Simulator battles, players are locked to a first person cockpit view. A joystick is heavily reccomended, but not required (players can use a 'virtual' joystick with their mouse).   Tank battles follow a similar logic, with less HUD elements present as the difficulty increases. Aircraft play a minor role in tank Arcade Battles. In Realistic and Simulator battles, aircraft play a larger role.   There are five nations available: The United States, Germany, Soviet Russia, The United Kingdom, and Imperial Japan. Each country has ground forces and air forces available. Each country has a tech tree, divided into five tiers. Players earn Research Points in battles to unlock new vehicles and modifications for their vehicles. Five vehicles must be unlocked in a tier to progress to the next tier. Players also earn a currency, Silver Lions, that is used to purchase these vehicles. Each tree has several lines, such as Fighters and Bombers or Light Tanks and Self-Propelled Anti-Aircraft Guns. Each vehicle has a Battle Rating to determine what other vehicles it fights.   A premium currency, Golden Eagles, is available to purchase with real world money. They can be used to purchase a premium account (earning more Research Points per battle) or Premium Vehicles. As far as the issue of 'Pay To Win' goes, War Thunder is fairly well balanced. Premium vehicles do not have any inherent advantages. Premium vehicles are usually a certain pilot's aircraft, such as Alexander Pokryshkin's P-39, a lend-lease or captured vehicle, like a British F6F Hellcat or German P-47D Thunderbolt, or prototypes, like the Ki-87. Premium tanks are similar. They have higher currency and research rewards or offer a unique playstyle not available elsewhere in that respective nation's tech tree.  The game tries, and succeeds in most cases, to be historically accurate. Some late war prototypes like the Maus tank or Kikka jet fighter are present, but most vehicles fought in a war of some kind.  Visually, War Thunder is a beautiful game. Almost every moment is worthy of a screenshot. For lower end machines, the graphics can be lowered a decent amount.   The main issue with the game is the grind. While there is no hard pay-to-progress paywall, around the fourth tier of a tech tree the grind becomes sufficient to cause many players to lose interest. Again, it is possible to reach the top tier of vehicles for free. But without a premium account or any premium vehicles, it can take multiple months to research a single vehicle. At lower tiers, progress is fine. But for jet-powered aircraft or ATGM-equipped tanks, one has to be an extremely dedicated player or purchase a premium vehicle or account to have any semblance of progress.      War Thunder is well worth your time. For a Free to Play game it is visually stunning, and it's easy to have fun whether you're storming a factory in Stalingrad in your T-34, part of a bomber formation in your B-29 superfortress, enduring artillery and cannon fire in a Leopard I, or dogfighting over MiG alley in an F-86 Sabre. And with naval forces on the horizon and the release of update 1.65 adding numerous much awaited features like bomber cockpits and Japanese ground forces, there's never been a better time to jump in.",

It doesn't even ballance the team by vehicle types... so you get into matches (planes) where 1/2 of your team are bombers and the enemy are only fighters... that's an auto loose! Grinding to top rank vehicles is also useless becouse there is nothing to do with them, they have no other purpose that any lower rank vehicle and you have to wait in the quene for a very long time becouse very few players play them.   Don't get me wrong the game was good at patch 1.35 (more than a year ago maybe 2) but after that it just got worse!

But as the years have gone by systems changed to make the grind worse, more and more pay to win BS was added and the devs have made it more and more readily apparent that they don't care about their consumers, only making as much money as possible off of us.

I play both Tanks and Aircraft and it seems the balance goes down the drain the further you get and the matches get less and less enjoyable. Planes are great, although the Russian aircraft get really annoying as a bit less than half the players i it seems bring them into battle. I love American tech and Vehicles so I primary them, and then the Germans for both game modes and it from what I experience everything in the American lineup isn't as good as the others it's put up against - this is mostly directed for ground forces. A massive chunk of the earlier tree is made up of the M4 Sherman type tanks and its great at first but when you use the same gun for 5 tanks down the same tree facing tigers and panthers and broken T34 it becomes incredibly stale. Now that I have 2 6.0 tanks going into battle is now a complete waste of time, I usually when I play ground forces get 4-5 kills per match but now i'm getting less than 300 RP and barely a single assist. My advice is to either 1: pay for premium/golden eagles to boost your way out of the terrible 5.7+ mess of a matchmaking or quit and play another of the factions until you hit that point. It, after hundreds of hours of work is incredibly dissappointing.",

Here's a few reasons on how Gaijin royally screwed up, as they have done so many times before. You have to play Russia to win. I payed $10.00 for a dog tag to gain access into the thunder league to play the event. I was excited at first, in fact my first few games were goign well. We won more than we lost and even the losses weren't that bad because you could hop back in right after the game was over and try again. So thus day one ended and I placed 587, (you have to be in the top 150 to get the tank). So not bad, I'm thinking that I have all day Sunday to improve my ranking.   This is where Gaijin, once again, screwed over its players and community.   I logged back into War thunder to participate in the event. I like the American line and had been using my M46 Tiger and M26 Pershing the day before. I get into the event and my tanks aren't there. What? Instead, there is the M4A3 series of tanks such as the E2 Jumbo and the premium Calliope. So I go out in the Jumbo and We are paying against 2 IS2's and a T34-85. I get one-shotted 3 times and our team loses. No one on the enemy team loses a life. And it's not just this way for America, no no no. All countries are set to certain tanks to make the game more 'fair' So in other words, one has to play the Russian line to even have a shot at gettign kills because everyone who plays war thunder knows, Russian Tanks are OP.  So needless to say I had gone 24 wins and 8 losses the day before to 10 straight losses in a row with the same team the next because we could not kill the Russians unless we played as the Russians. And since I don't prefer to play the Russian line, and enjoy my Americans, this really blew.   So thank you Gaijin for once again trying to balance a game and making it worse. This hasn't only happened this one time but many others, I guess this was the final straw.",

Your Russian &amp; American counterparts have the same + better armor, better bouncing, and much faster speed. - Maps are most of the time just a race to the capture points. Since your German tank is as slow as a snail, you will loose again and again to the faster Russian &amp; American tanks. - For the love of god, don't use a panther tank, your turret will be disabled 99% of the time by a wisp of wind. Shooting your counterparts in the turret will just bounce it off, and even if you somehow manage to do damage, they will probably still be able to shoot. - Your German gun needs to time to get in position after a hard stop, it will slowely crawl it's way to the center of your crosshair. While you wait for that to happen your Russian and American counterpart, can just stop, aim and fire.  - And if you still want to play after all this negativity, don't forget to put your graphics as low as possible you will magically be able to see through trees and bushes.",

Fun!  This game shares considerable resemblance to the games made by Wargaming, namely World of Tanks and World of Warplanes. However, Wargaming's products tend to be very 'arcadey' in their gameplay, require an obscene amount of grinding, and seem to be heading into the direction of e-sports. And while it is true that War Thunder also requires lots of grinding to unlock the best toys and has tournaments of its own, it also leans more towards realism than Wargaming's products, for better or worse. The mechanics of grinding to unlock new vehicles and upgrades for them is shared, but while World of Tanks forces you to play mediocre vehicles like the M3 Lee or Jagdpanzer IV to unlock the much better M4 Sherman and Jagdpanther respectively, War Thunder allows you to get experience towards unlocking your next vehicle of choice regardless of what you choose to use. In other words, you can use the F6F Hellcat and gain experience towards unlocking the F4U Corsair, B-25 Mitchell, or even stuff much later in the research tree like the B-29 Superfortress and F-86 Sabre. So in short, War Thunder is like World of Tanks/Warplanes, but with less BS, less moneygrubbing, and  far  less vehicles that saw no combat or never made it off blueprints.  To answer the biggest question all people have about free to play games: No. War Thunder is not Pay to Win. Anyone who tells you otherwise is either a troll, an idiot, or a fanboy of the competition. And while you can spend money on War Thunder to increase your experience gain or to buy special vehicles, none of this feels like 'must haves' as Tier VIII Premiums do in World of Tanks when credit income starts becoming a severe problem in the light of rising repair costs. Some things will take a little longer, but you can easily get by in War Thunder without spending a dime. And besides, there are plenty of awesome vehicles to use in the early parts of the tech tree, so it won't take long to get to the good stuff. :D  Since the game is Free to Play, I feel as if there is little more I ought to say here. If the idea of a game where you can fly around planes or drive tanks and make people explode sounds appealing, then go ahead and give this a try. Who knows? You may end up having lots of fun! :D",

Gaijin Entertainment has certainly beaten its Wargaming counterpart - World of Tanks - with this simulator and I will tell you exactly why.  I - HEALTH SYSTEM There is no such thing in this game. You don't see no health bar that shows you how much damage you've taken or can still take, what you do see, however, is your tank's status. You can clearly see each part of your tank, like the tracks, suspension, engine, fuel tank, ammunition, turret and individual crewmembers. There is no way to destroy a tank just by shooting its hull continuously in areas you can penetrate (like in World of Tanks), but you can effectively disable a tank by shooting its engine, fuel tank, ammo rack or by knocking out its crew. The last option really pisses people off for a reason.  Same goes for air battles. Your plane can get knocked out when it gets damaged just enough that it can't stay airborne, or when its wings are clipped entirely off. Or the pilot is killed.  II - PROGRESSION While progression can be quite slow, it's generally fun and more rewarding than in World of Tanks. Why? Because it simply has a lot of things attached to it that are worth the grind! Namely, the more you earn experience, the more you can use it to upgrade your tank's modules, like, add fire extinguishers (which are free), add APCR rounds (More penetration at the cost of damage, also free), improve gun stability or your tank's turn rate which is a lot of fun. Sure, progression speed is based on how many kills you can rack up per match, or how good you perform (assists count too, and they count for a lot), but in general, it's fun and rewarding.  III - CUSTOMIZATION Customizing your armored fighting vehicle is free! You don't have to pay real money to attach a flag or a symbol, or some text to your vehicle, but you do have a limitation. You can attach two things at the same time, while, if you pay, you can attach four things on your vehicle. Customization options include camoflage, world flags, numbers, sentences that tankers used to write on their tanks back in WWII and a lot more. To unlock certain pieces to paint on your tank, you need to complete a few challenges. When you complete those challenges, you're free to paint on that text or symbol that you've wanted to attach for a long time!  Note, this is just a small review for the game and it's prone to editing, but overall, I recommend this game to EVERYONE who wants a good World War II tank simulator. Forget about World of Tanks and its grind and unfairness, War Thunder is the best WWII sim ever and for now, the best tank sim (Until Armored Warfare appears, anyway).",

            "review_text": "Fantastic WWII based flight sim, for the great price of free.  Currently there's 5 nations available to play (and you can swap at any time) with a whole host of iconic aircraft to play with in any of 3 different play modes which are designed to cater to those that want a fully immersive simulation experience, a quicker, faster and easier to control arcade experience, or for those who find themselves in between.  Tanks are due in the near future, with naval combat planned for later on in the games development cycle.   The game run's well on pretty low end systems, and looks absolutely stunning on more powerful gaming rigs, and can be played with mouse and keyboard or joystick well (in fact, mouse and keyboard is actually easier than stick for arcade mode)  An RPG style progression system means that you are always able to work towards either improving the planes and crews you have, or unlocking new ones, whilst having a very active developer means that there is always something fresh to try, and some new event or map, etc to try out, plus there's various in game achievements and decal/skin unlocks to work towards to give you a sense of direction when you want it.  Freemium unlocks are well balanced, and typically provide a better range of options to a player, than any kind of 'pay to win' scenario you can find with some other titles.  If you like flight combat sims, you need to give this a try. If you're a fan of FPS style games, take a look anyway, it's surprising how much fun tearing chunks out of aircraft, instead of people, can be.  ",

But, on the down side, the matchmaking sucks, the community moderators are complete DonkeyHoles who were born on Pluto, but the actual WT community itself is awesome. There is, however, one really helpful and nice moderator, his name is MaximeDelaroux. If you have any questions or advice about WT, I highly suggest messaging him.  Going back to that mod thing, I got banned for 5 days for saying 'grammar nazi' in a chat jokingly. I mean, WTF? This is a WW2 game for goodness' sake.   Oh yeah and I think that the absolute most important thing that needs to be said to any prospective new players is that this game requires SO SO MUCH grinding. You start the game with beginner planes that don't cost much and you're like 'huh. pretty fun' then like two months later you realize that it's taking you like 4 days worth of time in game just to get one plane, and the cost of each plane just goes UP and UP.  Now for the conclusion. Basically if you want to have a good experience, play the game, rank up, try to avoid fighting commies, better yet play as a commie, don't say anything in the chat, and always say something pro communist in the forums in order to gain the favor of the mods. ☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭☭    How to have a bad experience: Use common sense in the forums, say something anti communist in the chat, and try to give the devs useful advice.  Thumbs up for the WT players and the game itself Thumbs down for the stupid matchmaking and the Soviet moderators. 8/10 Would argue with drunk communists again",

            "review_text": "I'm Speedkillerr and I've Played War Thunder for exactly a year.I think this day is when I started playing for the first time and I was kinda excited because I liked the idea of driving a plane in WW2,which those kind of games is my thing.   This review is about other people's complains and opinions that i've seen in all over the game.From forums to steam reviews.  So on December 2013 is where the update 1.37 came out.I checked the game reviews and no one liked it for a reason.I kinda realised why but I still need help understanding why that update was such an issue.  One thing I realised why people hate this game it's because of the tank update delay. It was supposed to come out on december 2013 but it came out on may..7 months after.I get it,it's a pretty long time,but there are other games who take years to bring a trending update,which brings inactivity in the game. But tanks are out already, and I hoped I would see more positive reviews,but still..i saw negative reviews with the 1.37 update,i still don't get it.Can someone explain what was the 1.37 update about?  Other thing i realised it the XP research for vehicles...I realised that after the 1.37 update research became waaaay harder. It took me 2 months to unlock a mustang with about 100k research units. I thought that it was normal because as you level up and change Tiers,it gets harder to unlock stuff,but you get more XP in the latest tiers. So now normally you get about 500(and if you ace on battle 1000) research points on Normal Arcade. I had to spent 430 Golden Lions to get over 30k research units on my jet that I want to unlock with about 270k research points...which it'll take daaays and maybe months to unlock. There are events that pop out once in a while where you get tons of XP (range 1000-3000) and tons of silver lions. So I guess that's why people hate on WT now..?XP research?  Anyways, a particular thing I've realised is that russian Yak's and FW's became too overrated and OP. I mean..everyone is using em!But I don't hate em.Okay,sometimes it's annoying when a yak chases your back and their cannons do one shot one kill.Also Airacobra's from USA vehicles have cannons but there are higher chances that you're going to miss.By the way i've never driven a Yak so if i'm mistaken about all this,excuse me.I'm just explaining people's opinions.   About golden lions. I've realised they have really made an impact on the game. To make a squardon,you need 2500 golden lions which is about 10-15 US dollars.I think that's ''okay'' because the powered people can make a squardon,which means more balance to the game as giving power to someone. But let's say there is a bunch of noobs or bunch of people who don't purchase lions and they really wanna make a squardon, welp.. that's unfortunate. I think the price of making a squardon should lower a ittle bit. I think 500-1000 would be fair enough. Other thing about golden lions is that they should make free golden lion farming more often on events and missions. That's how i earned 400 lions once. And I had enough for XP usage, a 6th crew slot and XP crew points for upgrading it. So a review/update on golden lions should be happening.  Anyways, that's all I had to say on my review. I hope I covered every negative review that this game has or people complain about. In my opinion, this game is awesome. XP and updates should be a problem but other than that, I enjoy my time here. I play for fun really and not for trying to unlock stuff. An advice I have for all of you is to play with other people.If you are in a squardon, you are in a good luck to play with others. It's much better and much more efficient. And people who say that this game is made just for russians, that's bs. Everyone plays this game and no one has the right to make an international game just for certain amount of people, unless it's been banned in certain countries. By the way this is the first time i post an opinion like that online lol,so if i make mistakes, dont hate please :p just give me your opinions in the comments or help me out to understand some stuff that i dont know or i typed wrong on this review.  So keep playin folks. Fly your plane, drive your tank and soon enough... sail your ship!!!!  -S-",

            "review_text": "Where can I start with War Thunder? Well, I'll start with the basics. I stopped playing about 3 months ago and the whole game has changed. When I stopped, you had 20 plane tiers. This meant that when you go into battle, you were fighting people in the tiers one below you, same as you, and one above you. What this did, was allowed you to fight planes of similar ability. Now, you have this 5 tier system, which is ♥♥♥♥. No other word for it, it's just ♥♥♥♥. Seeing it on Steam, I redownloaded it and played in what is now called Tier 2. What happens now is that instead of playing 3 tiers out 20, you fight against 1 tier out of 5. This means you are fighting people in planes that could have been 4 tiers above you in the old system. For instance, you could be in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bi-plane just out of WW 1 and someone in a Mk 1 Spitfire can come up behind you and one shot you.   I really did love playing the short time I played. Don't get me wrong, I LOVED IT! But the problem is, I can't love something that has been developed by people who don't listen and don't think ♥♥♥♥ through. I cannot imagine playing it for more than 24 hours, which is incredibly short for a game. If you're bored and have an evening to yourself, definitely play it. It's f2p and good fun and the start. But after the 2 hours I played it as a Tier 2, I cba with War Thunder anymore.",

Stealth buffs to everything Russian and stealth nerfs to everyone else, awful balancing and totally brain-dead decision making at the Gaijin office.  Air combat was wonderfully fun at one point, the developers just couldn't stop messing with flight models and game mechanics. The developers just can't leave the German, American and British planes alone, they're uptiered in every battle where they can't compete and their flight characteristics are being screwed with night and day. Russian planes are always on the receiving end, they're always getting flight model buffs, weapon buffs, you name it. Japan is largely forgotten about, they're left alone (Thank God) and they stay mostly evenly tiered.   Bombers aren't even worth the effort. You spawn a whopping 2,000 meters above fighter aircraft spawnpoints where anything that has a decent climb rate can intercept and shoot you down. Your gunners might as well be useless. At lower tiers, aircraft don't yet have powerful enough weapons to tear you out of the sky but you don't have enough turrets to deal with them and at higher tiers, you have more than enough turrets but anything ranging from fighters to attack aircraft have laser cannons that can cut your wing off in the blink of an eye. Spare yourself the wasted time, people.  Ground Forces suffers from the same thing that Air Forces does, terrible imbalance and brain-dead developers. Tiers 1-2 are about as balanced as you're going to get, after that, the Russians take the torch. Tiers 3-4 are completely dominated by soviet armor. While German, American and British tank players have to put up with slow, heavy killing machines that take varying amounts of effort to maneuver around the battlefield, the Russians get insane ammunition buffs and super arcady feeling tank models, it feels almost as if you're playing World of Tanks. By the time you reach Tier 5, the playing field is mostly even again, barring uptiered Tier IV tanks. Everyone gets morbidly overpowered main guns. This is the transition to Fin-stabilized shape charge shells and Sabots. Everything is an instant kill fest at this point. This wouldn't be an issue if they would separate Cold War tanks from WWII like they said they would many years ago, but a lot of Tier IV players have to deal with this until when or if that time comes. I for one, got very sick of being one shotted by T-54s and Leopard 1s while I tried to play my Tiger II.   Overall, this game is a total trash heap. I could have recommended it a few years ago but this game is totally destroyed. I almost get a tear in my eye and a lump in my throat remembering what a jewel of a WWII game this was. I watched it self destruct, I've never seen a game commit suicide as hard or as fast ever before in my life. It makes me sad.",

I am finally at the point of uninstalling, so many hours invested to be ruined by bad development and a poor attempt at a FTP system.   This game used to be fantastic. Unfortunately now its a FTP cash cow in the hands of some extremely greedy developers.  I've sat in on their teamspeak events as well as been involved in the forum community, the lack of attention or care to the core gameplay mechanics and fixing them is abhorrant.   The paid vehicles outperform the non-paid ones at every level.   Matches are horribly imbalanced (have been for about a year now) with no fix in sight even with huge uproars in both steam and their forum communities. Beware having critical opinions on the forums as you will potentially be squelched or banned.   Their answer to the problems as of the last year: add more graphics/ physics, add more vehicles, add more content. Thus making it even more difficult to balance their game for themselves. Seems like backwards logic to me.   Once they prove they care about their audience and listen to their playerbase I will continue to recommend this game to people as I have for the past three years.  Until then I remain a very dissapointed fan of a once great game.",

Yes this game is a 'Free to Play' but that does not stop you from unlocking a lot of powerfull planes easily with out having to pay. Once you get to tier 4 its become quite harder to unlock your planes, and that is where the pay to win comes in. All in all i only spent $20 on the game and have almost every single plane unlocked, the $20 really made a big difference in researching and unlocking rest of the planes through premium mebership.   DOWNSIDE: The developers in my opinion are kind of stupid, they nerfed the crap out of bombers because the people complaining about them being 'OP' I have a whole fleet of [B-17] Bombers and it really sucks getting shot down after 3 hits.

The match-making in this MMO combat flight sim is brutal and unfair, and I'm already fed up with being cannon fodder for the veteran/paying players.  It started out fun for me. I've played a good number of combat flight sim's, both realistic and arcade, so I'm experienced with them. This one has nice graphics and gradual levels of realism and numerous control options and a plethora of aircraft to fly, customize, and tinker with.  When I first got started, I was flying a late WWI era bi-plane - and so were pretty much all the other players in my first dozen or so matches. Most if not all of us were newbies at this game. It was fun and challenging. I even found myself sometimes ranking among the top players on my team (this, due to my experience with other combat flight sim's).  But after I attained level 3, I started getting thrown in to swim with the sharks - that is, the veteran players of this game - and it got un-fun real fast. At level 3, then 4, I found myself being shot down quickly and repeatedly by level 20+, level 30+, and even level 40+ players. Not only were these players way more experienced with this game, their planes were way better too! I had to painfully line them up with my slow and jittery plane and fire away at them with my plinky 7.62mm machineguns, trying to whittle them down, while they could swiftly turn around and get behind me with their faster and sleeker planes and blow me away with just a burst or two from their 20mm cannons.  Oh, sure, I was able to upgrade my planes with the points I'd earned from my earlier matches, but the increments of those upgrades were painfully slow, small, and relatively insignificant. Yes, I knew that I could spend real-world money for a bunch of credits to accelerate my progression and buy better planes and weapons, but...   No thanks. I *hate* pay-to-win MMO's. And I especially hate the ones that appear to be free-to-play, only to lure in bunches of newbies to provide cannon fodder for the paying/veteran customers.",

            "review_text": "First off, let's start with the positives.  GROUND FORCES: It is very realistic, so if you want a game where your abilty to aim matters more than what tank you have (usually) then this will be a solid game for you. At the moment they have Germany, USSR, USA, and UK (the UK is a relatively new addition, and the Germans just recieved some new TDs); possibly more nations on the way, but I am not aware of which ones they would use (it is supposed to be a WWII tank sim after all).  AIRFORCE: It is fun, and if you get good with a class of plane you can be untouchable. At the moment they have Germany, USSR, USA, UK, and Japan.  The negatives, and this applies to both.  UNBALANCED GAMEPLAY: USSR Vehicles are MUCH better than they should be. The last game I played before I stopped playing, I was inta-killed from the front by a T-34, with my armor angled properly so the round should have bounced. The reserve Sov aircraft will survive encounters that kill any other faction's equivalent, lose a wing? No problem if your Soviet, you can keep flying for quite some time more than anyone else.  For Ground forces: Crappy 'realistic' physics. What I mean by that is, you will flip in arcade a fair ammount...But not die. And when you flip you can request aid, but it won't actually help you. The best they can do, unless they are in a heavier vehicle than you, will be to drag your tank out of the line of fire.  Basically at this point, I cannot recommend this game because how much better USSR vehicles are...Unless you play as USSR, in which case go for it. But if you want balance, wait until the devs actually get around to finally balancing it out rather than just glorifying the USSR's military.",

            "review_text": "EDIT: Bellow my new review is the old review that is still quite valid. NEW REVIEW I quit playing this game a while back due to huge balancing issues, I cam back to the game with it being perfectly balanced, Tier 1 and 2 planes, I start getting quite good KD (like 6-0 or 5-1) And I start to see NO tier 1 planes, just Tier 3 and some Tier 2. But I have at this point almost unliked myself a tier 2 plane, I am quite excited as I will finally have a chance against the enemy planes again. I unlock it and, suddenly tier 4s and 3s everywhere, I understand putting someone with a kd of like 5-0 with more planes of a higher level but this is insane, I can't even stand a fighting chance, I get nearly instant killed and it takes several minutes of constant grinding to actually kill an enemy fighter, Love the controls great game, but 100% ruined by a lack of balance.  OLD REVIEW  I would like to reccomend the game. It is a lot of fun, but it has fatal game breaking flaws.(Aviation Based) First off the first four hours were great, my only deaths were an occasional pilot being kocked out or me crashing. Usually about 8-1 KD. Then after about rank four, top tier teir 2 planes are the only planes I fight against, my poor tier one plane cannot take out enemies who can be faster, turn better, and are better armed. Of course whenever I am about to kill one, my own team member swoops in and steals the kill. Now I get 2-3 KD with about 4-12 assists (and some ground targets). I see the occasional tier one plane, they usually are the kill stealers on my own team. Fun game, bad balancing ruins the fighting. PROS +easy +fun +minimal cheaters CONS -Unbalanced battles -Pay 2 win -Slow to progress (hours of grinding.)  4/10 would be a 7/10 but the unbalanced battles take it down, because the games are frustrating rather than fun.",

            "review_text": "War Thunder........ I don't know how Gaijin could screw up a game like this so badly.  I would've easlily recommended this game quite a while ago.  Now, just because I have less than an hour of gameplay on STEAM, does not make my review invalid. I've played probably over 100 hours on the non-steam version.  Allow me to explain myself. War Thunder is a great game mechanically for planes. It's all there-probably one of the most realistic experiences you can get to flying mid-20th century planes. Mechanically, its all there, and it is super satsisfying to shoot down a plane in realistic/sim battle. But what's wrong with the game if it's mechanically there, and WT does it better?  What's wrong is Gaijin's greedy business model. Gaijin has not listened to their player base ONCE. Gaijin also has been tearing this game apart patch after patch, claiming that the non-Russian planes weren't as good as they historically were. However, they keep buffing all the Russian stuff. No Russian bias here.  Next, we have the horrible, horrible, and super compressed BR rating. This rating system is based on how well people have done in a certain tank or plane. Gaijin wants players in games, so they've been compressing the BR system more and more, to an absurd amount. Essenitally late-model WWII planes can face Cold War jets.  PhlyDaily, a youtuber that has done an insane amount of War Thunder videos, has a conspiracy theory. The reason why Gaijin is compressing their BR system so much is not to get players in games, per se, because they could uncompress and grow their player base, but rather, to make money. Golden Eagles, the currency you can buy with real money, lets you research stuff with free experience, which means that people can go through whole tech trees without actually grinding them. The theory is this: Gaijin is trying to fustrate the player base to the point that they will spend money to get to the end-game jets.  Honestly, I tried bringing myself to playing it again. However, my P-47 Thunderbolt feels SUPER sluggish in realistic battles. Yes, I know, its a heavy plane. However, before I stopped playing, it was much more mobile. This goes for all my American planes. The mobility just sucks now. I don't know what to do, honestly. Right now, I would tell everyone to let War Thunder die at this point by telling the people who still play it to leave. That is an unrealistic goal, however.   Don't bother on the War Thunder forums, either. The moderators are filled with Russian pride and can't take a single criticism about their game. They will literally throw the thread into the trash bin on first sight. Try it; I dare you. They are just a bunch of immature 20 year olds who, apparently, don't want to improve their game by not taking suggestions. 'Well, he's against the game, time to throw the thread into the trash bin and ban the OP!' The only reason I am writing this review is so that hopefully someone doesn't waste their time or money on this former-decent game.  Thank you for listening to my rant and reading this review.",

The Russian bias in the game is laughable. All the fanboys claiming otherwise are likewise laughable. Get the game if you want to see WWII vehicles drive and fly around with some nice graphics, but unless you play as Russia you will lose most games - the devs even hide the victory stats of the different nations to conceal this fact.  If you want a tank combat game that's actually fun for the most part, give Armored Warfare a try, it's also free, and free from bias toward any particular fighting force. War thunder on the other hand, has sadly gone down hill since launch - the missions for realistic air battles are the same broken pieces of ♥♥♥♥ they were three years ago, and the tank combat is becoming more and more like WoT with toybox sets designed for point-blank street fights that favor Russian tanks over everything else.  But whatever you do, don't point this out to the fanboys, you'll get told to 'get good' 'l2p' etc. I did learn to play - I played Russia with an 80% win rate. Germany? About 30%. America? About the same as Germany, maybe a bit better. But I guess for some reason I'm only good with Russian tanks, and that reason has nothing to do with them being far superior in the game to their counterparts.  Also; you think artillery in WoT is annoying? Imagine having player controlled aircraft dropping bombs directly on you with an actual crosshair that shows exactly where they'll land while they're in third-person view. Thought the spotted indicator from WoT was annoying? Well, same thing here now - added in a recent update you can now see the enemy through solid objects once their spotted. And all of this in Realistic Battles, which used to actually have SOME simulator aspects.   Just got a shiny new heavy tank with good armor? Too bad, you'll be pitted against tanks from between 3 to 18 or even 30 years in the future using Vietnam war era ammunition against your WW2 solid shot shooting ♥♥♥ thereby making you nothing more than an easy target. Unless you're playing as Russia, of course.  Not to mention the various pay to win vehicles, which are actually available to every nation, but I guess that's how you're supposed to win against Russia, amirite? And my god, are they ever pay to win. Especially the planes. But especially the tanks. But ESPECIALLY the planes. Want an american rocket ship armed with cannons that climbs as good as the actual german rocket fighter but 2 tiers earlier? They have you covered. Want a tank with practically the same armor as even the absurd German designs which never actually even existed evan as a fully built prototype - the maus - but are still in the game because otherwise German endgame would have nothing to fight the 70's era Russian bs outside of 1 medium tank? Just $50!   I mean, they have the me 262 fighting the mig 17. That should tell you everything you need to know right there.",

War thunder is my second most played game, and i think it's quite fun, it's got tanks planes boats coming out and a new game mode coming where all of them can fight against eachother on huge maps kind of like planetside 2. Any one person can enjoy war thunder, if you can put up with one thing. One thing alone is what ruins this game, the community. All of the talk of 'Russian bias' and horrible match making is, in most ways, wrong. I'm sorry if you're butt hurt, but there is no russian bias, to the point where it's become a bit of meme to say 'Russian bias' at everything. Though some people still take this seriously. but in reality, tanks are not dominated by russians, if anything they are dominated by germans, and in some cases the U.S too (M-18's and M6A1's). The only time russians really do good is around the third tier (T-34/85 and KV-220 kappa), after that it's really skill that tips the balance of a game.  First off, my point on the community, oh god the community. All they do is complain left and right, gaijin fixes something, they complain more, etc. I can't think of once were the community of this game actually credited gaijin for their game, that being said, there are some people who are out there just trying to enjoy the game, yet theres still the people who say 'But thers 2 much russian bias'. Yeah, i can get a little mad when i'm in my Tiger I and a T-34/85 kills me, but it's really all they're doing, i can just respawn, and get him back. Higher tiers can also be quite annoying in the 'russian bias' regard, mainly due to the addition of the ZSU-57-2 and the IT-1, which i hate just as much as the next man, but i always remember 'it's tier V, all i gotta do get good and move on'. Sure, those tanks can be cancer, but MAUS is a very good counter to these tanks, that is, if you're in Tier V.  My second point will be on the matchmaking, something i myself can say can be a bit annoying. Post war tanks against Tiger II's may sound a bit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, yet almost every game i play as russia with the allies at 6.7, we lose, guess theres too much russian bias for them to win games. though early tiers are acutally quite well balanced, when people start going up against post war tanks is when they complain the most. There is one thing i wish gaijin could REALLY work on, that being better communication with the community. I've been waiting so long for the T-32 to get to 7.0 rather than 7.3 (Trust me, it makes a huge difference) that it kind of pisses me off, though, they have been listening more and more lately (some small examples being fixing jet RB for 7.0's and nerfing the panther II's reload in arcade).  Then there's Aircraft. Planes are a bit of a mixed bag, RB is for someone looking for a more realistic take on an air battles, where as arcade is your go to gamemode for grinding and having a bit of fun. That being said, there are some problems with it. Some of the planes gaijin has been adding have been quite over powered for a while, then nerfed, then still getting called OP by the o-so-positive community, this mainly being planes like the TU-4 and BV-238 for example. Neither of these planes are that great anymore due to balancing of how they work (TU-4 now facing jets, BV-238 seems to be easier to kill for me.) which is what really makes planes something any new player should go to first.  Lastly, Since i've seen it i couple of times in other reviews, i want to touch on the CEO and his handling of the hack that (From what i can tell) isn't really in the game anymore from early on this year. What he did was stupid, nothing more then stupid, then i hear about what they did in regards to the russian youtuber who pointed out flaws in the game, I dought this will happen again after they were exposed, and considering i've seen big youtubers point out flaws and not get their channels deleted, it seems the CEO has finnally stopped drinking vodka for breakfast.  Over all i can say that war thunder is a one of a kind game here on steam, and that it really is something that a love to play, so if you're interested flying famous WW2 and cold war aircraft, or duking it out in heavy weight panzers, or even Sailing the fair seas in you're shiny schnell boat. this game can be your key to enjoyment. Best of luck, and see you in the battlefields of war thunder. (Cheese level overload)",

It doesn't feel as if the devs actually cared about the history or about the player enjoyment as much as they cared about profit. The game constantly asks you to buy things as it is the definition of a pay to win game.( actually you aren't even gaurenteed a win if you pay so think of it as 'pay to play better'). 2, I love the flying mechanics and the feel of the game. It can easily make the inner kid of anyone come out. 3. THIS GAME IS SUCH A GRIND! This game is the longest game knowen to man. Not in a good way because if you every invest time into one of the really nerfed nations such as America, then you end up in a grind that will last 10000 hrs+ before you even finish the first tech tree. I wish the game was faster so you could constantly be moving through the progress of the tech tree and onto other nations. 4. It feels as if some nations are nerfed so that the nations with large and new playerbases such as america wish attracts younger and less experinced audineces to be less equipped and thus spend more money. In total, this game is very fun, it is also very very agrovating as whenever you start to have fun, you get held back or the moment gets ruined by some pay to win/unballenced aspect.",

            "review_text": "You wanna good WWII combat simulator? I am sure you do, thats why you are here, isn't it? You want that game to be well balanced too, right? Yes I am sure you do You want a game with no nation bias? Of course! Then why the hell are you looking at War Thunder? Seriously, go play one of the Red Orchestra games, they may not have planes and they may not be free, but they are cheap and have really good tank gameplay that is both fun and balanced and still maintain historical accuracy. In short basically everything War Thunder is not.  The first thing you notice with War Thunder is what I call the 'shell', which is basically what you perceive, the shell is probably the best part of War Thunder. The graphics are absolutely beautiful, all the models for the tanks and planes are fully detailed down to every nook cranny and bolt; but then you play the game, the game is pretty fun at first but once you hit tier II-III, thats when the game starts to go down hill and that is when you really and I mean REALLY start to notice something is incredibly wrong with the Russian planes/tanks. Just to put it into perspective (this is a true story by the way): My Tiger tank was unable to penetrate the front of a T-34 at less than 40 meters and he was directly in front of me, he ended up killing me because the Tiger really didn't have over 100 mm thick armor and a ridculous gun, thats just 'western propaganda' according to gaijin (I dont think they actually said that but it wouldn't suprise me if they did because that is their reasoning behind anything that is not Russian being under powered) Another example would be the time I went into a head on fight with a Yak-9 in my Typhoon mkIB (Very historically accurate I know) and naturally I killed him since 4 20mm machine guns hurt, but while his plane was a flaming and wingless wreck he managed to get ONE last cannon round out which caused both my wings and my tail to fall off and my plane was a flaming wreck just like his. Now that that is out of the way; remember how I mentioned 'the shell'? Well, the shell is not really there for most people, and while this problem has been delt with in the past it still exists, but what is it? Well, all those lush trees, bushes and grass can just disappear if you go into the options menu and turn down your graphics, and while on your screen you are very well camouflaged in your STUG III some Russian guy across the map sees you with your pants down looking like a drooling idiot. So how is the game developing you might ask? Well, the devs are just adding content and not really fixing anything, and the drooling middle school-age masses that is the War Thunder community is okay with this. Speaking of the community, lets talk about them. Basically the type of brain you'll be playing with are ones that are not developed enough to use logic and reason and if the match does not go in their way they will spam the chat all caps screaming at everyone who is still alive, its to the point where reporting these people is usless since there is so many of them and Gaijin doesn't do anything about them, thats why they are too afraid to fix the bushes and trees problem, they are too afraid to loose a handful of players.  There are so many more things I could go over, but there are other reviews out there that will explain those things I failed to mention in greater detail than me. I will end on this note: I do not recommend War Thunder to anyone. There are so many promises that are unfulfilled it makes DayZ look like a finished product. And the sad part is: This used to be a pretty good game, but it has been on a steady decline ever since before they added tanks a couple years ago Well, goodbye my friends, thank you for reading this review and I hope it helped",

I used to play it every day, now I fire it up once a month for a single game and then leave after noting nothing has changed.   The Battle Rating compression is the single worst thing they have done in this game (among many), it seems implemented just to frustrate players in to buying premiuim and premium currency just to get to a stage where they can actually compete at their Battle Rating.  War Thunder as a concept is incredible and indeed it was for a few years, but the last year in particular it has been ruined by the matchmaking system and the devs ignoring community concerns with strict policing on the forms.

It sometimes takes me back to the brush back in 'nam... you never knew when Charlie was gonna take a pot shot at the column. Cept in this game, you get it from both ends, gotta watch out for your own team so they don't shoot you in the back.   I kid you not, I've been in a few matches where my own team dealt more damage to my plane(s) then the enemy. It takes skill and cat-like reflexes to dodge teammates that come out of nowhere and fly right into you, or enemy rammers for that matter. Dodging teammates is as important a skill as dodging enemy fire and planes.   Twice the challenge, twice the fun. I prefer to stay in 3.0 or below, because I gotta say it, those Ruskie biplanes sure are fun to fly. (I-153 with 20mm cannons, AND 8 rockets?!?!?)   Now that I got my legs back, I can finally use the rudders again!   By the way, that low bridge with just 5-10 feet of clearance on that one stage with the rivers CAN be flown under. Just saying. Did it twice in a row this one match, trying to see if I could get the guy on my tail to try to do it and crash.   He didn't try though. Oh well, as I always say, y'can't kick ♥♥♥ and have 2 feet on the ground at the same time. In War Thunder though, you can't kick ♥♥♥ while you're on the ground, period.

Repairs take way too long to work while ur engaged in combat.  Biggest problem with this game is developer Gajiin not listening to their players. While everyone is asking for additional tier matchmaking tier from 8.0 to 9 or higher and lowering MM spread from 1.0 to 0.7 for monts they do oposite and shrink tiers from 8.0 to 7.7 making cold war era tanks like T-10m and Leopard fight against IS2, Tiger 2 etc, its literaly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ move from developer proving not just that they dont listen to their playerbase but that they are clueless as ♥♥♥. Problems with this game could be solved quite easily if developer would separate tanks that use HEATFS shells, increase battletiers and shrink MM to 0.7.

The response to simple questions about how to learn the mechanics result in several replies of 'git gud' 'Alt F4' and 'Delete system 32' Any issue brought up about the game in a negative light is met with 'U mad' as well as a several day ban from the game from a moderator. If you talk at all in game chat people get angry and report you. One small mistake leads to several enemy planes on your tail, all taking well aimed potshots at you from outside your gun range.

Last but most important to me. German and Japanese tech tree...

It might sound stupid, but I propped a small piece of paper next to my monitor with a list of Tanks and there 'sensitive areas', whenever I came under fire or in a heated exchange with an enemy, I was able to instantly refer to my notes to see what areas to attack their specific tank. I can honestly say that this helped me 100% and I would recommend others to do too.

            "review_text": "WarThunder is a complicated game to judge. If we purely focus on the game itself - it's a solid game; bugs are minimal and mechanics are well thought through in the different gamemodes.  Now, what lets this game down is its developers. Gaijin have truly created something unique and accessible to the games market, by pioneering a mouse system for flight control that works well. On the other hand, Gaijin's priorities are in entirely the wrong places at the moment (v,1.37-v.1.39). Gaijin are investing more time towards addings new aircraft, new ground vehicles, and events, rather than going back and improving what they've already created.  As a result of this, we see flight/damage models which are either unfinished, or not correct. This truly is a game-changing factor when playing realistic/full simulator battles, since those difficulty levels require extensive knowledge of your plane, as well as the enemies; what they can do, how they can perform, how to approach different enemies/situations, etc etc.  On top of this, Gaijin seem to have developed a weakness, in giving into the communities desires opposed to their own; in most circumstances where this is the case, the group with the loudest voice often gets their way. This has become even more clear in patch 1.39, seeing USA and Germany gain planes which further give them advantage, whilst also seeing nerfs to the USSR, barely any changes to high tier British, and unecessary nerfs to Japan.  Finally, the match-making system is fundementally broken. At high tiers, you have the issue of 'super-props' fighting weak jets. Higher up the chain that this, you see very weak jets fighting strong ones. At the bottom of the scale, you see reserve planes (the first few planes you get) fighting against planes of tier 1; although this is not massively imbalanced, for those attempting to learn the game, it may become frustrating.  At the end of the day though, should you try WarThunder? Yes, why wouldn't you, it's free? Just remember, although it's not pay-to-win, it is pay-to-progress.  UPDATE: 1.41 has seen the release of ground units - but more appropriate to this review, some previous mistakes have been rectified. High tier USSR (Tier V) appears to be on the mend, with recent buffs to the Mig-15. As well as this, the German Me.163 has had its battle rating increased, meaning it can no longer pick on Mig-9's and Meteor F.3's.  On another note, it is slightly worrying seeing how many mini-patches are being released for the ground forces compared to the aviation forces. To be honest, this is hardly suprising, seeing as average player numbers have gone from around 30k-45k per night, to around 90k.",

By now its the most realistic WWII Simulator, I'm sure that WOT players will say the same, and 100% not pay to win. And about golden eagles (purchase them if you want to support developers which i would recommend), I purchase them only for crews, 8 crews in hangar is enough for every country, i put 5 planes and 3 tanks, 5 planes is much more than enough, and if you want to get better planes and tanks earlier than pay to research them, but I don't really recommend that because you will skip some tanks and planes and just forgot them. I started playing War Thunder nearly when it came out, after a year I started through steam so my time of playing is like a beginner.

(EDIT: I have 915 hours in-game, just recently added it to Steam)   Blew up a Yak-9U with rockets going 500+mph 8/10 will play all day long  This game is fantastic! If you love flying and don't want to pay for it, this game might be for you. There are Arcade, Realistic and Simulator Battles all with increasingly realistic flight models (FMs). There are, however, many problems with the game, and thiss will not be the most glowing review.  - FMs are HEAVILY skewed towards Russian planes, decidedly away from American planes. The devs have no intention of changing this.   - ALL of the nations have their day in the sun.  Whoever it is that balances the planes at Gaijin, is permanently drunk. When they make one plane in the tier better, they not only do so with a heavy hand, they also do it without regard as to how other planes compare to the plane being altered.  If your plane sucks today, wait until the next patch, when it will either become SUPER MEGA AWESOME or be slightly better than before. When I started, it was Americans that sucked, then Japanese, then Brits, then Germans, then Americans again, then Brits and Japs, then Germans, now Americans again. Russia waffles between 1st and 3rd best.  History is glanced at and then altered to fit the Motherland.  -  Russian Bias.  Those Russkies can skip bullets with their wooden-skinned planes, turn nearly as sharp as a spit, climb like helicopoters, are faster than God and typically carry (historically accurate) heavy cannons.  The weaknesses of Russians? They overheat really bad and carry just a tad bit of ammo. Not really a problem when all you need to do is nail your first few shots and keep the throttle down.  - Gaijin Hates America.   - Instead of fixing major issues, like FM accuracy or excessive Arcade ramming, they simply introduce more planes.  Not only that, they introduce more PREMIUM planes. Because nobody should have too much fun, playing for free. Not too terrible, however, because I shoot down those Premium planes regularly.  -They don't really announce what they are fixing and nobody knows where the development is going.  Gaijin fails at communication , although Russian players seem to get plenty of feedback. (I resisted the idea of Russian bias until I got my friend's Russian girlfriend to submit a ticket in Russian, instead of English. Got a reply 30 minutes later).  - The grind can take an eternity, and they aren't making it any easier to get the next plane.  At around Tier 3, you will stall out HARD on leveling up, which is some serious crap. I just got my first jet after about 18 months of playing and I only paid maybe $40 total for crew training and a single Premium plane. The Prem planes aren't particularly special, but crew training makes every plane you get have a better chance of surviving.  - If you only play Arcade, the you'll think whole universe wants to kill just YOU.  I only play Realistic and sim, because I have a greater chance of running away. There is nothing wrong with running away, if you have time to spare, but in Arcade, everyone is in a small meatgrinder and players that play too long will begin ramming. Plus they all have maxed crews and shoot the biggest cannons.  Arcade is heavily biased towards cannon size and doesn't care at all for the plane itself.  Might as well make it all the same damn plane with ultra-cannons.  If you can get past these flaws and accept they won't be fixed, it's actually pretty fun, and the planes look great. It supports Oculus Rift and has SSAO, as well.  The combat is super fun if you aren't flying the current underdog nation (often but not always America) and Russians aren't unbeatable, just unrealistically powerful .  They don't have BS like 'Premium Ammo' or other pay-to-win crap.  People gripe about it being play-to-win. It isn't!! Paying does help, but you can do  just fine  by properly leveling your crew.",

            "review_text": "Well this game is probablly the best one in it's class by far I'll give it that. But god damn every update just brings more inbalances and problems while trying to hide it with new vehicles, maps, game modes (that people are forced to play and alot don't even want), and cosmetic things. Their medicine for fixing things is usually revenge by making the nation(s) that got screwed in the last patch more OP than it needs too. They added these unessecary things call jets which werent supposed to be in this World War 2 game. But they did anyway... and guess what!? since they didnt make enough or whatever reason they are stupidly using to justify... they are forced alot of times to fight against late war prop planes that go over 100mph less than them and can outrun you whenever they want all you do is stand and try to joust them when they decide to zoom by you. Also they gave Russia post war tanks to fight against Germany 2 late war tanks which is seriously underadvantaged. As time goes on bombers become weaker and more unplayable as the community demands for them to be easy unchallenging score padders. Whatever is nerfed and screwed up and accidently OP takes MONTHS to fix. When they update things they usually do it in a 'ghost' patch that no one knows about and only those that play super close attention or have memorized stats can tell. All the top squads are russian aim botters or overly aggressive ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who play dirty because they are probablly weak nerds in real life and think they have big epeens in War Thunder. theres only 5 english speaking clans in the top 100 which thats BAD since there arent that many squads that actively play battles or well enough to score. Mother Russia is heavily favored in Tanks, and they have the most consistent and non-broken Air Force ingame. America is always given a huge FOTM every patch (which isn't their fault) and all you see are people talking ♥♥♥♥ about how awful of a country they are and that they are a bunch of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and freedumbs and every person uses 'murica' in a sentence like 5 times... Because what happens in a russian video game seems to reflect on the entire population of a country and therefore is such a good determinant for what kind of country they are in real life and must be true (sarcasm). You cant say anything bad or negative in chat AT ALL because the tattle tell patrol is always watching and most of the mods are too stupid, dont understand english, or dont give a ♥♥♥♥ and usually chat ban you for days and weeks for saying ♥♥♥♥ or something of the sort in chat. Most of the time if you get banned there wasnt even a legitiment reason for it as ive PM'd the head mod several times and he has reversed my ban saying there was no reason for it or it was super excessive and has drasitcally reduced it. You get banned for having anything in your name that an axis member has ever said out of their mouth. Its that serious! The devs rarely listen to the community and let the broken heap pile up as they refuse to fix any of the good modes and just add more new modes that break. Alot of people wish that this game design was given to a different developer and things would be alot better and i agree... Its a great game, a great design, and its a REALLY fun concept honestly. Its really beautiful and has great textures and realistic mechanics. Although the development team has royally screwed it and has lost their way with what they have created. I say alot of bad stuff about it cause honestly i fell in love with this and i care about it and the people that play it. Its just things rarely change and right things dont seem like they ever will. Thousands of people quit every month. It has been declining since summer and is now maybe a 1/4 of what it was. If you start playing you will probablly get hooked. but it will be more of a drug addiction hooked than a fun hobby hooked. I only recommend it if you have a high tolerance for pain, frustration, and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Or if you dont have EXTREMELY love tanks and planes to the point you can look past all the cheap things that happen ingame. This game is the meaning of insanity. But its the best this genre has. Play at your own risk.",

            "review_text": "After having put over 1150 hours into this game I believe I owe to it to write a review for it. Now, I wouldn't put so much time into a game if I didn't love it... and I still do. It truly is a great game, competitive/challenging, fun with GREAT graphics...and I admit I am a sucker for good graphics. I have played countless tank and plane battles and here's my take on some of the things people in the reviews tend to complain about:  Expensive premium items/premium account: I tend to agree that the regular prices for premium accounts and items are expensive. With that said, they have sales twice a year offering 50% discounts on premium accounts and items, and with the discount, the price is actually very manageable. The way I look at this is for most of the games that I buy for $60 - $70 CAD, I'm lucky if I put over 100 hours into them. Having spent over 1150 hours on this game, I feel like I owe much more than $70 to the developers for continually supporting this game, so when it comes to cost of the premium account - yes it may be expensive, but at the end of the day, if you play this game as much as I do, which is a lot, it is actually very justifiable in my opinion.   Toxic player base: Yes it is, I believe this game would have been even more enjoyable if players were friendlier and worked together. This game is mostly full of lone wolves doing their own thing and have no understanding of teamwork. This is definitely a negative, and aside from greatly changing the game mechanics, the devs are not able to do a whole lot to change this, so this is here to stay.   Terrible Matchmaker: Yes it is. This is my biggest issue with the game and has been ever since they overhauled the matchmaker 2 years ago. This plagues both tank and plane battles and it just makes 0 sense. When you're in an IS-1 in the same map as a T-10, you may as well pack your bags and go home. I remember soon after the big update, hordes of players jumped on the forums to let the developers know that they screwed up, and 2 years later... nothing has changed. It seems the developers stopped listening to the players and are just doing what they want...which is fine since it's their game, but is also unfortunate to all the players that have been complaining for the past 2 years.   This game is thankfully not pay-to-win. Having a premium account definitely does help to reduce on the amount of grinding required, but as long as you're enjoying yourself and not thinking of it as grinding, you'll enjoy the experience much more. At the end of the day, people have to remember that this is a BUSINESS and as a business, they have to make revenue. If you're out here spending hundreds of hours on a free game, and are complaining about getting a premium account pop up every once in a while, then you are likely very young and have no understanding of economics.   There is much more potential to this game if the devs got back on track and began listening to the players again, but it hasn't happened in the last 2-3 years, so I don't have a reason to believe they will change their ways anytime in the near future. Nevertheless, I believe the pros in this game greatly outweigh the cons, and I would still recommend this game to anybody.   8/10",

            "review_text": "Let me start off by saying War Thunder CAN be fun. However, you have to keep two things in mind in order for it to be so.   Firstly, you cannot expect a balanced fight. Certain aircraft and tanks that are the supposed same battle rating (and therefore roughly as powerful) seriously overshine the others. Likewise, the matchmaking system does not match up equal forces; not only can player numbers differ, but composition can be so slewed that one side doesn't stand a chance.  Secondly, you cannot expect to win. Although this is a team-based game, there is very little reason for the majority of players to actually play that way. If you're in a squad with friends, you can get bonus points for sticking near each other and getting a kill. Other then that, there is no reason to support the rest of your team versus trying to get kills. One kill will net your more of a gain then winning the battle; as such, rarely will you find a player who will try to win.  There is a lot more things in the game I could complain about (such as the horrid modification research grind, the silly repair times, and the monstrous amount of time they expect a player to throw into events for paltry awards), but if you're having fun, the rest doesn't really matter. If you can play with the two things I mentioned in mind and have fun, you'll like this game. If you can't, you probably should pass on it.",

Enemy tanks not being destroyed even though you hit their weak spots and destroyed their fuel tanks or ammo racks and they destroy one of those on you and you die immediately. Also moving around in this game makes a person afraid cause on a odd occasion you can go over a little bump and then your driver will get knocked out your tank will get damaged so on so forth even died from such crap like this. Even a tiny little tree that is so easy to knock over stopped my tank and damaged quite abit of things. The developers for this game just dont seem to be able to program so well. But the main thing even though this game is free to play it is not a pay to win. You can use your own money to help you advance faster but you thats about it",

The underdog of the office, Ivan, stands up and says 'I hav gud idea how about insted uf gud fair fite we compres br and t10 cen make big boom boom to kil facist ww2 tonk' The great leader of Gaijin himself, Joseph Stalin, welcomed the change greatly and promoted Ivan. Unfortunately Ivan was then shot for treason two minutes after the meeting because facist spy or something. Did I mention this game had horrible matchmaking yet? Well it does. Also why is it that groups of russian people that can all hardly speak english but all speak russian very well talk to each other in english? Like are you ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥?

Yes, WWII planes flew much differently than jets do now, however, when a pilot turned his plane left in 1944, it went God damned left and didn't slowly drift back to the right. Piloting in this game is so unrealistic that I'm surprised Steam let Gaijin tag this as a simulator. On top of all of that, this game is just like all the other awful F2P games, so grab your mom's credit card kids.

My rating is based on main key factors,EG graphics level,runability on potatoes(bad computers), General playstyle,and other important aspects. Smaller side aspeccts are factored in aswell,but weighted lower. Onwards with the review! Number 1 weighted aspect.   Playability and Feel. This game feels like what it is trying to do. When locked in dogfights I feel like i am flying a, well, flying machine. I use mouse aim,and love it. The aircraft feel like they have weight unlike another warplane game. WorldOfWarPlanes *cough* 9/10 for this section  Runability on a poor computer like mine. This game runs excellently on a potato of a computer. OK,my fps capped at 20ish in combat,but what do you expect? This is weighted a tad lower in overall. 8/10 for hiccups.  Physics-type things! I LOVE games that feel realistic. I'm not skilled enough for full real yet,but overall these aircraft (and tanks) handle excellently in arcade and historical. Aircraft when flown skillfully enough,cut through air like a knife in warm butter. 9.3 Repeating.  Graphics. Hardest to detail. Ultra LOW settings give it a crisp,arcade-y feel,and high graphics immerse you into the world. The smoke and flame effects are gorgeous even on low. 10/10 would get shot down looking at perty fiiiireeee. 8.5/10 for some irregularities.  Misc. These are the low weighted things that people who nitpick about detail should read. First, Microtransactions. -10/10. You can throw money at the screen to advance. Glitches. My potato has a rendering glitch when swapping to other players after being shot down,they appear to be flipping out all over. Glitches lower the overall score by rougly .25 points.  FINAL RATING: All nitpicks aside,this is an amazing combat simulator. I am hyped for when warships are announced. The Mighty Wolf final score is 8.75 out of 10. There are some bad things,and no game is perfect. I love the gameplay of just dogfighting with people. TL;DR This game is amazing get it Mighty Wolf,Signing out!",

It should be known im a die hard bomber player, don't have much in the way of patience to fly around constantly with someone on my ♥♥♥♥ as im trying to hunt someone else down. So eh just go bomb things at either very high or very low altitude.    Game is rediculously stupid. Like every game, the developers put in a couple of overpowered planes and the entire world decides to use them (i.e Yak) whether in any game time (Casual Realistic etc) you're going to run into a fleet of these things that, even in a heavy bomber airfact, will shoot you down in 2 shots. Not joking, not over estimating; I am writing this after just playing a game from not playing for about 5 months cause of this stupidity. Literally, two shots. Saw the plane at a higher altitude (Because it should be noted theres no place safe for a bomber cause the fighters can fly higher and get there faster, so you could (as I have) essentially spend 5-10 minutes getting to your highest altitude to be safe, only for this fighter to see you and get up to you in 30 seconds then eat you.) turned around in efforts to get to friendly fighters, see a couple shots miss as a bank and then bam! Hear a 'ting ting' tail end starts smoking and one of my wings goes flying off a big B-25j like it was nothing with the message (You have been burnt out of the sky).   Yay.. just wasted an hour in updates. 5 minutes refamiliarizing myself, 5 minutes searching for a realistic game mode, 4 minutes loading, and 10 minutes of gameplay to not even drop a bomb and close out. Thought I kept reading in forums bombers are hard to kill, definently not in my case. Because this is def. not a one time thing for me.  This is basically a airplane version of Call of Duty: World at War. World war 2 setting, everyones running around with mp40s like crazy and getting loads of kills from them. So great!  It should also be noted I have, regretably, put money in this game before. Even trained all my bombers gunners to %78 accuracy and such. Yet theyre no help against these crappy overpowered planes.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: frustratingly fun.  The main basis of the game is that you start with crappy vehicles and as you use them, you gain research points to invest toward unlocking your next vehicle. In addition, each vehicle itself uses research points to unlock upgrades for better usability. Eventually you break into the next tier of vehicles which enables you to fight better and stronger opponents.  However, this brings me to my chief complaint: balancing issues. It is all too frequent that you might be using lower tier 2 aircraft or tanks and you would think that it would pit you up against high tier 1's or other tier 2, but it seemingly loves to throw in maybe some higher tier vehicles. This very frequently stacks the game such that a lower tiered player would struggle to defend oneself. This is pretty frustrating in aircraft, but with tanks it can cause frequent rage quits when someone's vehicle is simply unable to pierce the armor of upscaled tanks on the opposing team.  The game has adapted a nice variation between arcade and realism modes. If you're looking to play the simulator mode, aside from a cyclic and throttle you're pretty much SOL in terms of cockpit configuration. However, the mechanics and physics of the game are relatively high quality. For example, each aircraft and tank model is loaded with a series of hitboxes which determine what kind of damage takes place on the vehicle making fuel leaks possible, weapon damage possible, engine damage, instant pilot kills, etc.  Fun game. Worth trying. May or may not be for you.  ",

It combines simulation with easy controls and it does so very well. There are a few various game modes that very in realism and subsequent difficulty. Arcade mode offers you quick and simple playability with various respawns and a nifty indicator that shows you the estimated strike point of your ordanence. Realistic mode combines semi realistic controls in a historical situation. You are pitted against enemy aircraft in a semi historical battle and real world map. Simulator battels are for the advanced pilots only. it combines near perfect flight models with a situation that will have you constantly zooming in on planes trying to figure out if they are hostile. In this mode you have to be careful of flat spins and stalls as well as trying not to get shot down. It is a grueling mode with the horrors of bad team coordination and friendly fire ending in your demise.  all in all it is a very good game and I definitely recommend it.  -DogSpit",

So after a few days playing I figured I might try to redress the balance. I didn't play this game pre-1.37 so I've got nothing to QQ about, and the question is, if you've never tried the game before and you're wondering whether it's worth the download, the answer is a resounding... YES!  First things first - the game looks GORGEOUS. Absolutely beautiful scenery, great models (I'm no aviation nerd, but they sure look a hell of a lot better than my benchmark flight sim, Mig Alley Ace) and frankly one of the reasons I've enjoyed playing bombers is it's just awesome flying at 5000m en route to the enemy airfield admiring the scenery for a few minutes without any annoying fighters buzzing you. Even at 10 feet above the ground, everything looks stunning.  Secondly, game-play - another huge tick. Want intense 300mph action as you scream around 180 degree turns trying to get a bead on that Nazi a-hole that's peppering your tail? It's got that in spades. Prefer the leisurely cruise at high altitude dropping precision bombs from several miles up? Check. Dive-bombing. Torpedoing ships. Strafing ground convoys. You can have several planes per mission, so you can go for all fighters, fighters and bombers, fighters-bombers-torpedos, whatever you prefer. Massively adds to the variety, and therefore longevity, of the game.  Next - is it p2w? A resounding.... no! Buying Gold Eagles, the premium currency, will speed things up massively, but 2 points need to be made.  Firstly, what's the rush?? Yes, if you spend hundreds of *currency* you could complete all the research and race onto level 5 planes quite quickly, but why? It's not that if you level really quickly you can have some super-powered jet fighter to poon all the crappy bi-planes... Level 1 planes fight in level 1 matches and level 5 planes fight in level 5 matches, and is there really any need to whizz through the first 4 levels in a week flat so you can spend the rest of the lifetime of the game at max level? For example, after about 3 afternoons of battles I got my first level 2 plane, so I can now enter either level 1 or 2 matches. Am I crying myself to sleep at night because I won't be entering level 5 matches for quite a while? Not at all.  Secondly, are the rich kids who spent hundreds of bucks totally pooning the opposition? Absolutely not. Again, if you buy premium content, you'll advance through the levels quicker, but you won't be dominating the level you're currently in. [There are a number of planes that are only available for cold hard cash, but so far I've yet to encounter them in-game, and to be totally frank a skillful pilot with a plane available to anyone is going to kick the ♥♥♥ of an unskilled pilot with a cash-only plane any day!]  So it's NOT p2w, it's GREAT fun, it looks gorgeous, and it's FREE ffs!!! If you played before 1.37 and the update cancelled your hard-earned research or reduced it or whatever, that's not good and we should all keep a close eye on the devs for nasty surprises in the future, but don't use that as a reason to put off new players: and if you haven't played before and you're wondering, is this worth my time downloading, is this fun? Then ignore the old-skool grumblers and give it a go, if you have the slightest interest in flight-sims you'll have a blast!   I'll end by giving this f2p game the highest praise I can... I love the idea of getting something totally for free, and often approach f2p games with a sort of 'come on, force me to spend cash so I can resent you' attitude. With War Thunder, I'm thinking after a few days play of buying a premium pack, not because I feel I have to because I'm getting pooned in-game and cash is the only way to prevent that, but because I've been given a fabulous game totally free and I actually don't resent giving the devs some reward for producing such a great game - I don't think that's happened to me since LOTRO. And isn't that exactly how f2p should work??",

            "review_text": "I started this game about 1.7 years ago. I loved it to peices (I don't use Steam for it) and am sadder every patch when they leav what made it great. In tanks, if you fire a shell and it hits, it has a chance (Not based on logic of any kind) to do some damage. Here is the table of it.  Russian German American British  85% 38% 25% ?  In planes some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shoots you on takeoff and you are left with 7 minutes of not being able to fly that plane again.  The grind is abysmal. You want a jet without paying $300 and taking up 4 hours every day for 5 months? (That is no exxagerated BTW) Well look elsewhere.  Jets are horribly imbalanced anyway. The Me 262 is whooped by all the later jets that get whooped by the later still jets. They have literally no advantages. Except the Me 262, it has the most raw stopping power in game. (But it is so innacurate, and if you get some hits a 'sparkle sparkle' happens, and your 30mm HE shells do nothing)  Modules are another pain in the ♥♥♥♥. Mostly at higher tiers, like 4 and especially 5, these modules are often essential, and a plane with them can feel like a differen plane to one that lacks them, even if they are the same type. This is compounded by the fact that at higher tiers these can become very difficult indeed to get.   Also, there is often very screwed up match making. Tiger 1s, for instance, face IS-2 1944s in most matches, and simply cannot penetrate them front on, no matter how lucky and well placed it is. The IS-2 1944 on the other hand, can blow the Tiger half way to heaven in one badly placed shot.   That and simular scenerio is far too common. Someone, decided that He 51 biplanes that barely exceed 250mph in a vertical dive, are great matches against P-40s that can easily reach that speed in level flight, have 3x as many guns with 6x the damage done.  Bombers are also very screwed up. If a fighter looks at you your stuffed. Any cabbagehead can send any bomber in flames to it's doom in almost any fighter with minimal effort. Don't even bother with escorts, fighter pilots are always too busy murdering enemy bombers.   A minor note, some guns sound funny. (This can be amusing) German 7.92 MGs sound like telephones!  But seriously, this game can feel like extortion if you can't commit thousands of hours in a re;atively short period. I think I have played 2000+ hours, You would expect me to have every plane with all the bells and wistles? Nope. I only have 2 jets, and that's because I paid for faster RP.  The forums reflect this, so deeply routed are these issues that no-one contradicts them, and thus conversations devolve into 'This is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! That is historically stupid and not fun at all!'  Hell, I coined the phrase 'Snakers and Ladders in 3D' simply because of all the luck. As long as you have a tiny bit of skill, you can get crazy ♥♥♥♥ because of RNG. (Random number generator)  And you know what? It has 6 modes, Tank Arcade, Air Arcade, Realistic Air, (Don't let 'realistic' fool you - it's not) Realistic tanks, Simulator Air, Simulator Tanks. In 'Simulator' and 'Realistic' modes (Often refered to as Arcade++) sometimes teams will not resemble any air force. I remember a game in my He 112*, I shot down a P-36 (American prewar fighter) and on the enemy team was also a Japanese bomber and two Spitfires, one on each team. Oh, and it was in Guandalcanal. (Pacific island, it was fought over in 1942 in a massive battle)  In tanks this is even worse, (This is Realistic and Simulator Modes) with T-34s fighting Panzer IVs in D-Day. Urban maps are also the norm, no tank battles were fought in cities IRL, and there is NO infantry. NOT ONE SOLDIER. Even in Stalingrad.  As Call of Duty, I rate it 3/10. As Simulator, I give it 1/10, for looking realistic for the first 7 seconds of play.  *German fighter, never saw service besides a prototype tank busting in the Spanish Civil War",

When you see on tier 2 matches people between rank 5 and rank 150, you just gotta pray that the high tier people are on yours side, as otherwise you just get obliterated. Then there is this Crew upgrading mechanic in the game to make players that have been playing the game longer than you to be statistically better than new on every aspect.   So, if two exact same tanks, other with fresh crew, other with fully upgraded crew, aims each other at same weak spot and fires at the same time, the upgraded crew wins 95% of the time. Even if neither are destroyed on initial shot, the upgraded crew recovers from the hit faster, repairs the damage faster, reloads the gun faster, and you can imagine the rest.  This would be totally OK if these two players wouldn't meet on the battlefield, but the horrible matchmaking makes new player's experience pretty much like I just said.  Obviously you can just throw money to Gaijin and get better tanks and upgrade your crew faster to make your life less miserable which is their business plan, but is the game really worth it?",

            "review_text": "There are lots of really great things about this game that amount to nothing for one reason: mouse aim. Mouse aim is a control scheme option that is ostensibly for newbies and those without joysticks. In practice, however, it removes every ounce of skill required to fly in this game. What it actually does is has the computer control your roll pitch and yaw in order to steer the plane towards where your mouse cursor is pointing. The end result of this is that people using this control scheme have an absolutely massive advantage over people playing with either joysticks or other control schemes.  This is the same as mouse+keyboard vs controller for a shooter, where the mouse has a very significant advantage over the controller. The problem is that the mouse aim control scheme does not, in any way, feel like a flight sim. It's more akin to early 90s arcade rail shooters with planes.  This control scheme ruins the game. There are modes where you can play where mouse aim is not allowed, but aside from the fact that no one plays these modes, they are nearly impossible to play without some sort of head tracking device.  This game has a great deal of potential but is ruined by the devs putting in what is essentially an aimbot.",

The game dislays beautiful graphics and detail of the landscape at max settings. The game is also in my opinion, challenging because the game is dependent upon skill mostly. In Warthunder, a good player who exhibits high skill in completing the objective will more than likely progress 2-4 times as fast as a player who is the opposite. Warthunder is a great game that is being updated frequently and should be tried out by players who display interest in WWII, armored vehicles, and/or aircraft of the WWII era.",

Its best to get off and do something else than to start spray acid everywhere, like some do.   What you will also notice eventually: Whining about certain races and/or vehicles. Some of that is true: War Thunder is -not- a symmetric game. Certain vehicles will be better than most of its competitioners. Thats just how it is and its hard to avoid with balancing. I would advise to simply learn about those vehicles and use them yourself - there is no shame in that.  Some of those complaints seem to just stem from people not knowing how to play their race, though. How to angle your armor or how your country works: Germany for example sports rather accurate and well-powered guns - in turn theres some dangerous weakspots in many of the tanks bodies, which can get you killed quick, if you dont use cover well.     // Now. If youre just getting into this game yourself I could tell you a ton of things and you would forget most of it before you even started your first match. So here are some basics:    1. Choice of Nation. When you start out, know that each of the 5 Nations has its strengths and weaknesses. Here is a rough guestimation:  US: Many fast Tanks but often with weaker armor. If you start with their planes know that Monoplanes will almost never outturn Biplanes - they are often faster than Biplanes, though.  Germany: Their early tanks are Glass-cannons. Dont trust on your Panzer 3 &amp; 4s armor too much, use cover and drive carefully. The Guns are often accurate and deadly - early HEAT-ammo is quite effective - especially on long range.  Russia: Thickly armored Tanks and often big guns make deadly combos. Some consider them overpowered. Their early Biplanes (I-15) are also very deadly and outturn almost any plane. Their guns can be somewhat inaccurate, though.  UK: Rather durable planes with lots of deadly guns - less maneuverable than other nations, though. I havent had much time with their newly introduced tanks, yet, but they seem to have medium armor at best, quick reloads and good damage but horrible accuracy.   Japan: Their planes are quick and nimble - but also very fragile. A few salvos and you break apart and/or catch fire. As of now they dont have any tanks introduced to the game - history tells us they werent that great with tanks and had plans to buy tank-tech from germany.    2. 'If you die too much, hang back!' No really - You probably want to reasearch all the planes and tanks - but feel free to hang back at the beginning of matches and watch where your teammates go and where the enemy is. Being aware of the map and where everyone is is your &gt;key to success&lt;. (No really, it is!)    3. Watch that 'Battle Rating' Warthunder lacks a bit in introducing you about its mechanics. Every Vehicle has its 'Battle rating' you can see when you hover over it with your mouse. Know that the highest battlerating of all the tanks in your bottom-row at the mainscreen - the ones you go into battle with - determines what opponents you will face. If you slot in newer, better tanks with higher Battle-ratings, your opponents will also be stronger.  Knowing that you sometimes might want to wait after researching a tank, before you let it take the place of one of your older ones. I would say: Have at least one more of a similar Rank. 0.3 points higher or lower.    Finally - play with friends, join a clan or just start a group ingame by chatting people up. If you can use Teamspeak or Skype to talk it will be even better - and you will get an advantage over your opponents. Teamplay really helps!",

Like the game has decided that you've got your win in, and now it's your turn to lose.   I love realistic mode, it really gives a feeling of tension, and you've got to keep your head on a swivel.

At least take it out for a free ride with friends after binge watching some aviation films.

Dying to fly in the Spitfire or the BF109? Wanting to jump in command of a Tiger tank? Heres your life sentence condemned to the exp grinding mine. Unless of course, you pay up and obtain a shower of special exclusively premium vehicles and booster packs, making your life and your crews' substantially easier on the battlefield.  Lastly, the non-existent paywall could be heaven or hell for you depending on your randomly selected teammates in each round and their squad of vehicles. The Battle Rating or BR system basically doesn't care about your puny Panzer II and will definitely drop a few Russian KVs or some higher tier vehicles in on both sides, hopefully. Basically, once in every one or two Arcade games, you might just unfortunately end up as a free exp buffet for the opposing team and if you do care about winning, its going to be frustrating to fight unfair and uphill.

Now, it seems that skill doesn't matter and you can just wanton shoot at a tank in any area to do damage (in realistic and arcade). Critical points seem to yield no more damage than a shot in the thickest armor, yet my 3.7 BR tanks are taken down by mere 3.2 BR tanks with one shot.  Airplanes are fine, but it's mostly just grinding to get higher planes and teamwork is non-existent.  I'm incredibly disappointed in where this game has gone.

The game is awesome, there is many historicly accurate depicted planes and tanks , the models are great. There are currently 5 factions to chose which offer different styles of play and their own advantages and disadvantages for example , American tank destroyers are quite easy to get early and carry a brutal punch while their beginning tanks are kinda bad compared to other early tier tanks , russian T34's have Great sloped armor and a hard hitting 76mm but a noticeable flaw is that its ammo racks are situated in the front and if you get a lucky shot , you can cause internal combustion. Germany have Decent beginning tanks such as the Pzkfw IV and III but all have short barreled guns and are weak until you get the long barreled version such as the G models , the same apply with their tank destroyers , the Stug . These are just some differences , there are many more . Overall the game is very fun and you dont have to grind that much which was surprising (as of this review being written , i have over 20 tanks and 10 planes without putting in cash .

That game was a great WW2 airplane combat simulator and War Thunder also is, but this time with tanks added to the mix.  Pros: + WW2 simulator. WW2 combat simulators are never enough. + Has arcade mode for those who prefer a 'WoT-alike' experience but with further 'realism' (will explain later) and better mechanics (because tanks having HP is lazy) + Tank customization the way it should be + Great graphics + Low graphics requirements for the cheaper computers + Free game  *The 'realism' is very debatable, because most people (should) know that german tanks and airplanes were the best in the WW2, while russia had cheap, fast and easy to build tanks and the other allies had numbers and strategy on their side. In this game however that can not happen because everyone would be driving Tiger tanks or piloting japanese fighters. Adding to this there something called 'russian bias', which will be pointed next.   Cons: - Rammers. People don't know how to shoot anymore, ramming the enemy fighter is WAY easier, specially if you have a crappy low tier fighter and want to take down a godlike high tier fighter/bomber. - Russian bias (although I have a doubt here because I've never seen russian airplanes/tanks consistently owning everyone like most people claim to have seen). What I have seen though is that the ones that usually do that are russian players, so can we really blame them for being good? Russians are the european version of asians, they are good, and they rarely play anything other than russian planes/tanks. - Tanks feel too fragile some times... A heavy tank CAN be destroyed in one hit if: 1º- You don't know what you are doing, heavy tanks are not invencible; 2º- The attacker knows what he's doing. Most tanks have weakspots and smart players WILL exploit them until you are dead! It's all down to skill and knowledge.    The most common Cons I see and why I think they are wrong: ~ Pay to Win: No. Just... No. I own premium airplanes and they are shot down as easily as other airplanes, and do as well as other airplanes. I NEVER use the premium airplanes I own because they are worse than my normal fighters. I can test drive premium tanks and they are as effective as normal tanks, sometimes the weakspots of premium tanks are even larger than on the 'normal' version. Just because some guy had a hard time fighting rocket launcher tanks it doesn't mean they are OP, they are just as bad as all other tanks, just don't pick paper-armor tanks and don't be afraid to push your barrel agaisnt it's hull. ~ Spawn-killing: For this to happen you are either losing HARD or you/your team has no idea how to play the game. Learn to play and defend your positions. Lack of skill CAN'T be replaced by blaming map layouts. ~ Battle Rating making russian tanks more OP: My KV-1 has been killed by a german medium tank in one shot. BR of both tanks was the same (KV-1 had 0.1 or 0.2 less). The next match the same happened with my T-50. Learn to play and stop blaming the russians.  TL:DR on the common complaints - This game is ALL ABOUT SKILL.  Also, do not try to blame the game for any difficulty you have because the biggest problem is between the screen and the chair, not in the code.",

'oh you wanted to do a loop? stare at the sky and stall out while I auto level you.' (from pretty much any veiw) the tanks are no different, if you got cash to burn you can buy all kinds of camo to make you blend in with the bushes, but fire off a shot and everyone knows where you are and you one-hit-kill dead from the credit card kiddies. not recommended unless you enjoy shouting obscenities at your screen towards people that can't hear you, game is a broken micro-trans mill to make the devs a bunch of money while causing you no end of angst. unless you got daddy's credit card and can afford to buy the over priced in game currency. go play Heros and Generals, it's much better, without the need to pay for everything (sure it has micro-trans but really not required to enjoy the game, unlike this one. AND they have tanks and planes and paratroopers and snipers and infantry all playing on the same field, alot like battlefield) bottom line, let them miss you with it, ********** let em miss you with it. 10/10 would not recommend this game to anyone.

Not only that but in games such as World of Tanks, higher tiered vehicles will have an alarming advantage against lower. In this game should your aim be true, a biplane could kill a jet. Anyone can kill you. This adds a level of concentration that other games, time after time fail to provide. Such games as COD you can go out guns a blazing and top a leader board. Such stunts are rare in occurence. With over 200+ plane models and soon to be available are the ground forces extension. This includes the tanks of WW1 WW2 and the korean war. With challenges realised on the odd occasion based on real events, prevents this game from repetition as every plane will handle differently from the last.

            "review_text": "Conceptually, a grand idea. 3 levels: Arcade, Realistic and Simulation. It is free to play, but if you want to avoid hte long grind you can buy your way to different levels of aircraft and armour.   The flight side of War Thunder is quite diverse and really provides some entertainment value if you like flying and historical aircraft.   Ground Forces however, is a different story. The basic metrics compared to historical data are far from correct. They are working on balancing matters, but it is far from desireable. The high end graphics are phenominal... however it decreases your visibility significantly. The developers have designed the game so the graphics level can accomidate your computer if its low end or seen it's time pass. The issue being those with high end devices run the lower graphics settings to allow for greater visibility at distance, which is a big plus in this game. Really, that amount of resources they must have invested in the spectacular landscape and maps could be diverted to other pressing matters. I am not the only one... watch the streams and see how many people show maps which are minimalisitc when it comes to foliage. Driving through the tall fields of wheat is epic... for the 1st minute of the match till someone one shots you as they have a significant view range advantage.  Another issue is spawn camping. Nothing more frustrating when you have the ability to respawn during a match and before you can even place your vehicle in gear you're destroyed. And sim these matches are mainly pugs... it really drags down the ability of good players if the team is not the best or lack experience.   If you have no desire upon winning or losing, commanding your own vehicle can be quite exciting... If you're frustrated by imbalance and ongoing issues, try one of the other tank sims.  Personally I play it as I like the 1st person command level and have invested some RL money into it. But as time has gone buy, the frustration level stops me from spending any more real life dollars here until they can provide a better sense of game balance, resolve the graphics issue and spawn camping.   Update.. as if the 1.51 patch matters worsen. The spawn camping is the ultimate fail for this game. Why allow multiple respawns when there are always a few whom sit outside the spawn area and sink shots into you soon as you spawn? I know there is a difference between getting basically over run and 3/4 of the opposing team is sitting at your spawn. It's when one or two go all the way around the map border then sit right off the spawn location(s).  I'll still play, but never more will spend any real $$ on this game. Watch twitch... you'll see the number of players on WoT outnumber this 500 to 1. Also, when someone like Jingles announces on Youtube that Gaijin has been taking down his commets due to the point he was pointing out the negative aspects and one sidedness in this game, that is the icing on the cake.  Update 1.5.5 December 2015 They have been about things, making some changes.  - Low end grahics They have introduced a new engine and it seems about 80% of the issues have cleared up with the visibility 'cheat'. Nice work - Spawn camping It now seems that when you rez you're invulnerable for a certain amount of time. Helpful. - Balance I guess the trendy would say Russian bias. However they have introduced the British line and they at this point in time are OP. Play them and you'll win 80% of the time. I tired 30 games the other day, 15 German, 15 Russian. As a German I was on one winning team. As a Russian I only lost 1 match.  - Marketing... egads... they need to be sacked and hire some people whom address the wants of the customers.",

To have game after game of ground battles decided by who is first to gain air superiority is stupid. If you do play the game dont waste money on it, there will be plenty of times you are betten in completely stupid ways that bear no resembalance to a proper ground battle tactic and it will make you angry more often than you have fun games.

Edit: The new tier and leveling system released today (12/19/2013) with patch: 1.37. Not too sure if I enjoy the new leveling and tiering system, because you REALLY have to decide which planes you want before you buy or even research them. As well, it seems to take a LONG time to acquire new planes. You seem to be able to fully upgrade 2 or 3 planes that you own before you can buy any new ones. I do enjoy the new tiering system, and the matchmaking is even faster than before, and the planes are much more organized in the research tab. Still don't like that the squad maximum is only 4. Interesting game so far; can't wait to see what lies down the road from here, with the tank forces in beta, and naval forces on their tail!  Re: Edit: (04 Jan, 2014) I am not enjoying this game nearly as much as I used to. The whole leveling up and plane purchasing system is unusual and still confusing to me. I don't like the way the planes are mushed together into 5 tiers instead of 20. More often than not, I find myself facing much stronger opponents with much stronger guns and armor from the same tier as myself. I am still playing this game, but only because I have friends I enjoy playing with. Not too interested to see the tanks or the battleships. Don't even want to recommend this game anymore.  Re: Re: Edit: (14 Jan, 2014) Another update, more unengaging gameplay. I am glad they fixed the ability of a tier 3 bomber to end a game in approximately 4 minutes (looking at you, Yer-2's), but am discouraged of the reduction of lions and research points awarded to bombers for doing their job (bombing). I don't even want to play if any of my friends are not on. It simply isn't fun. This research system just stretches out how long it takes you to get to the planes you want, and they even increased the points on some of the planes that i've already unlocked the ability to purchase, requiring me to re-research them some more in order to buy and fly. I had high hopes for this game, but everything they are doing seems to make little to no sense, as they try to exploit those willing to pay-to-play, and punish those who do not.  Re: Re: Re: Edit: (19, Apr, 2014) Finally! An update that makes sense! Thank you for lowering research point values on EVERYTHING! Lower planes was nice, and the lower modifications feels feels like a bonus!. Hopefully now I can play some catch-up to some of my friends. However, not a big fan of not being able to skip planes anymore. If I don't want something, why do I have to research and buy it to get something else I want underneath? Otherwise, I can't wait for the tanks. Tally HO!",

For the most part though, you'lll find yourself playing in the era of the second world war. That is unless you decide its worth your money and time to either purchase premium time or a premium aircraft (I recommend it).

But then I ran into the Yak-7k? something like that either way it was a russian low teir fighter with a thirty seven milimeter cannon and a good one at that in real life they made like two of things because if they fired to fast then they would stall out thier plane because of recoil. And it was manoverable as ♥♥♥♥ so it could one shot you and then get out of their in like five seconds. However I overlooked this becasue the game was still fun and it was only one plane right? Nope its pretty much all of them the IL2 is impossible to take out, the Russian 7.62s fire faster and do more damage then any of the others and their 50 cals are more like twenty mils. And then the tanks came along. An american tier one tank, a thirty seven mil gun and paper armor with no angleing and a big engine in the back. A german tier one tank, a twenty or maybe thiry seven mil gun and again paper for armor and huge armor. A russian tier one tank, a fast forty five mil gun mounted 45 milimeter angled hull and it takes on the two I mentioned before is just rediculous. Even in TIER FIVE when all tanks should by now be about guns and not armor the Russians still have the best, they have the T-10M which mounts a great gun that can pen anything and the enemy cant bounce it. The Americans and Germans get tanks with amazing guns and before the T10M pretty good armor but they added in new ammo and now armor means nothing so everyone can pen everyone right NOPE. The T10M, which is another made up tank, gets an angled pike nost at such a degree that it is almost an automatic bounce. So the game was fun but then wave after wave of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t came in and now its just a Russian eog pandering piece of junk, which they have stated that yes they do make Russian vehicles better than they historically were and yes they do make allied and german machines worse that they were historically were.

(Yes sadly it's a real thing in Warthunder, where tanks only render after one-shot you in the face!)  -Gaijin Mighty Nerf Hammer! (Don't worry comrade! If you are in a russian plane/tank and you get killed just cry in the forum! Russian Thor will bash the vehicle's nation that killed you, to trash!)  -Battle Rate system! *ping*   -Simulator Battles! You can play them but you need to play with whatever Gaijin wants you to play with! Because Freedom I guess...  -LazerCal for the Murican bombers (sets you on fire one-shot), NukeRailGuns for the Russian bombers (I'm looking at you IL-28).   How do they want to make the game good if they only find ways to screw it?! I'm looking foward to the Hawker Hunter, it is my favourite jet of all time, but at the same time I don't want it in game because I know it will get NERFED! Of course, this game has some good things like, it is still better than WOT :D ... Play at your own risk, it will cause you to rage like never before.",

However, with the current state of the game, I would not recommend it to new players due to the unfair Match Making forcing new players to face far better preforming planes from older players. Players who came prior to 1.37 also has a significant plane advantage which means a lot for arcade mode. New players will have to grind each plane individually while older players did not. In terms of unlocking new planes, it has been proven multiple times by players that the grind has increased over 250% even with the current patches.   Base bombing has been ruining arcade games since 1.37 while battles ending in less the 5 minutes even with the newest patch. Finally, the communication between the DEV's and the players is absolutely horrid, with little information about changes, fixes and solutions on problems.   As for Realistic Battles, many planes have current broken flight model's such as engine over-heating bugs which causes significant disadvantages. Finally, most Realistic Battles have more bots then actual players and these bots have broken flight model's allowing them to pull off feats that would be impossible otherwise.",

Just in general kicking its ♥♥♥. And then clean out of no where it fires, goes through a glacis basically horizontal to it, goes into some empty space and kills my entire crew instantly, knocking my tank out, no spall.  Aswell I was against a T-28 at one point and I watched a shell go clean through the gunner's face and I got a 'target undamaged'  A Chaffee ten or twenty feet from me in clear view was not revealed until it had practically ran into me and I was already dead.  A T-50 was not declared dead even after using a lot of my ammo reserve on it, it stood fast until I shot the headlight once and the thing just spontaneously combusted.   I'm deeply sorry Gaijin but I just can't enjoy a game when I actually have to worry that a crewless tank with an engine fire might be able to kill me.",

With the most aircraft available of any flying sim ever, and the devs 'trying' to make it as close to real life as possible, it's definitly worth checking out. There's also a tank mode, worth checking out for the novelty, but it will get bland fast due to this mode not being finished yet.  THE PROS: Loads of airplanes with each their own flight model to try out, there's planes for the USA, Germany, Soviet Russia, Britian, Japan, and in lesser extent Italians.  With 3 modes to choose from, being arcade, realistic battle, and sim mode, there's a gamemode for everyone.  New content being added by patches every so often  THE CONS: don't let this scare you away, at it's core it's a really great game, however, it hasn't quite reached it's full potential yet, here's why:  The grind sucks, like really really sucks, at higher tiers, when you think you've finally completed all aircraft, get prepared for an even longer grind for plane modules to make your aircraft even remotely capable.  Unbalance, again, at higher tiers you will have 1944 aircraft flying against post war aircraft and jets.  Dev team unresponsive/not listening to community. This is the main factor for me. Many people have ideas how to make the game better in their way, and of course, some of these ideas are crazy and not possible. But when an entire gaming community complains at once about certain aspects of the game, and nothing is really done, that's going to be a real negative.  All in all, it's still a great game, don't take the grind too seriously, because you will get frustrated, instead, just try and play for fun, and suddenly the game seems a lot better, yes, it has it's issues, but there's not much to be done. We can only hope our suggestion's/complaint's/bug reports will reach the dev's someday.",

The grind past teir 3 is awful , just terrible, im stuck at 3 cuz i dont want to go through it any more. But i can deal with a large grind if it wasnt for the biggest issue of all. The devs are either rascist or extremely biased as Russians . the best factions go like this .... Russia, america and germany tied, then britain and last japan. and thats jsut for planes , idk what ppl know about ww2 but russia had ♥♥♥♥ planes , they were cardboard that could be rivaled by mexicos airforce, that is why they a, almost didnt beat back germany and, b , is why every russian plane has 100 god damn guns on it, because their guns were crap.... now i could deal with them making the russian tanks better, but i dont have much experiance with the tanks and i just hear complaints about tht game mode.... Germany had the best airforce in ww2 , and i was playing with a teir 2 bf 109 and was chasing and shooting a il-2 teir 1 plane.....i ran out of ammo and got shot down before they evern were smoking, and im not bad at the game no matter what trolls say.... its rediculous no russian plane could EVER beat and american or german plane, and yet time after time they do. to me it seems like the devs are still russian cold war junkies that want to ♥♥♥♥ off the west, and tbh they are fools for it. no one cares wether russia was better than anyone else at anythign ever, we do care , however, if russia or anyone for that matter is being biased towards themselves in a VIDEO GAME . its rediculous ... they are pretty much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ everyone off who i talk to and that equals to loosing money. This game is NOT HISTORICALY ACCURATE and is biased towards their devs and it needs to end, either by them changing it or ppl getting fed up and not givingthem money anymore. so please dont play this game unless they change their attitude towards the western world .

(i'm personally not really into tank-battles) The planes feel really responsive and each have their own characteristics that make them turn, roll and shoot different from each other.     The tech-tree is interesting as it makes the planes/tanks less powerful when you first obtain it. After playing enough battles (and earning enough research-points) you can max it out and get the best version of that particular tank/plane. In my opinion, it's sometimes a bit tedious, but compared to getting new planes unlocked, it's a lot faster and more rewarding. also, it makes advancing through the ranks to get better planes a little bit more fun (since, you generally are not really paying attention to that due to the slow pace of getting new planes/tanks unlocked).   Gaijin Entertainment is frequently launching new tournaments that involve specific planes and tanks in which you can obtain limited edition of said planes (which usually costs lots of premium currency). The only drawback of this is that most of these tournaments involve planes/tanks of rank 3-5. Seeing that there are currently 5-6 different factions to choose from (and obtain planes/tanks from), you have to have put in a lot of effort to make sure you can participate in every tournament that is held.   This game has a free-to-play model and with this model comes certain limitations. To actually make profit, Gaijin Entertainment used premium currency and a subscription-service. The premium currency is called 'Golden Eagles' and is exactly as one would think: you can buy premium services, like extra crews, boosters, premium planes, etc. The subscription model gives you more regular currency (silver lions) and more research points. In all honesty, i can't review this specific part of the game, since i haven't invested real-life currency into this game.  In conclusion, would recommend if you like to have dogfights in WOII settings.  ",

I look forward to seeing this on a purpose built PC some day. Controls are very smooth and well laid out for all levels of expertise. You really don't have to ever have played a flight sim or MMO to enjoy this. It is a brilliant game. The only thing I don't currently like about it is that it is not friendly to the beginner. You start out with a rather bad set of planes and for the first hours of play you really have to rely on your team mates to work together to get anywhere decent. It's also in that respect really a bit of a grindy type of game. You have to spend a lot of time to get the basic stuff. I'm sure once you get some decent ranks it progresses very quickly. Still a great game though. I would definitely recommend this to anybody. I can see it working really well with a few friends.",

With Tanks soon out this year and warships soon to follow after tanks  The game has 3 gamemodes/flight models   ARCADE is for people who aren't fussed and just want to have fun featuring multiple respawns  REALISTIC features more realism such as engine overheating and the planes wings ripping off if you increase in speed. features one plane when you lose it you must wait for the match to end  FULLY REALISTIC BATTLE this mode disables third person camera and you are confined to your planes cockpit and must scan the skies manually like the aviators of yore.  The game is fully free to pay with the option to buy certain planes but these are rendered useless unless you know how to utilise them to their full effectiveness. There is very little buy to win here as anything can be countered if you have the correct tactics  I won't give it a rating number as I find that system silly but this game has brought me many hours of joy and I hope I have conveyed that whether an interest in flight, history or the wars spanning 1930-1950 I highly recommend everyone try this game.",

These are extremly powerfull for their level and therefore i cannot get any EXP due to me dying 24-7. Also since a recent patch it has made it hard to get the planes and will require more time put into it to get these planes.

Your goal is to either wipe out every remaining plane on the enemy team, bomb out the enemy team's base or destroy their ground units, or for tanks it may be capturing a position for your team to achieve victory instead.  Either way, YOU WILL HAVE FUN. I assure you, there is NOTHING more satisfying than setting a plane on fire in an intense dogfight involving literally, LITERALLY, 12 people.

Warthunders constant updates really keep the game interesting and fun to play.   Since my original review did not contain any criticism at all, these are the points which are on the negativ list:  1) You can not reach the highest tier of vehicles without a premium account. Yes it is possible, but for the average player having an average life including stuff like work for example it is not. The only way reaching tier V is to concentrate on one nation and one of element of the game (tanks or airplanes). But only playing one thing isnt really an option since you will miss a lot of interesting content.   2) Some nations are not beeing simulated historical correct to archieve a better balance. Some nations even seem to be buffed a bit. This is a bit disappointing if you are interested in the technology used in the war and would like to have an at least approximate experience using your virtual machine of war.  3) Just like its rival World of Tanks (and the other two) the prices are just crazy. But i guess we are all old enough to make a budget and keep ourselfs to the limits.",

Let me start off by saying one thing- You will never find a WW2 Arcade or Full simulator as good as this, its beautiful, historically accurate and you're always learning something new.   Arcade mode is easy to play and great for everyone, the controls are simple and the gamemodes are fast paced.  Realistc offers a fun game mode for people who want something close o historical accuracy and a more realistic mode without the full restraints of a full simulator game, game modes make more sense and are more team driven.  Simulator is for the pilot who wants to go all out and challenge themselves, gamesmodes make perfect sense and are even based off real battles, the planes act realistically and you're forced into first person.  This game is great for everyone because of its sheer ease of access, playability, the fact that it's free, and the range of dificulty.",

Stalin could compete with Hitler just because he has 40 tanks on 1 German tank. In this game you need 40 German tank to kill one T-34 and you still need hella luck too...

It is one of the best simulator games I had played since it has tanks (Expecting ships for all factions and ground vehicles for Japan.) It takes a lot of space in your PC but you'll love it in the end.  HOWEVER, there are some points to be considered. If you start off as the UK on the army then you'll get the Teterach tank from the start. Whenever I drive it, it keeps on wriggling and just can't get it on the track unlike other vehicles. The same applies to the A13. You will experience AWFUL Package Loss, which can be fatal to your battle specially in air battles since you'll crash onto the ground when you were flying 3,000 KM up in the heavens a second ago. It'll be good if they can add Fairey Battle to the UK.  ***The developer also made Star Conflict which is a similar game but Sci-Fi. In the both games there are Premium currencies- Golden Eagles in WT, which can be used to purchase some premium vehicles, modifications (instantly), convert *convertible* RPs into RPs and buy Silver Lions. In Star Conflict you get repleshments of the Premium Currency by completing missions. However, in WT, you must use real money to buy these premium currencies (Golden Eagles) ...still I appreciate that this game is free.***  Apart from that, this game is largely recommended by me anyways. Installation will take long but it'll be worth it. Just play it to try it out, if you don't like it then uninstall it- you wouldn't have to spend a penny afterall. Be sure to complete all tutorials and collect rewards since they are wonderful and have a good battle, Pilots and Tankers!!!",

In almost every game you are instantly blown to bits by a Yak-9. On top of this, they made the new exp system take WAY to long. The old one was perfect, you got lots of exp. For example, an aircraft would require 100000 exp to unlock it, and each game you got 1000-10000. Now, an aircraft requires 100000, but you only get 2000 max. So once you get to medium-top tiers, you either have to be the best player on the planet, or you have to divote your life to this game. I still like this game, but right now it just takes too long to do anything, and with the overpowered Yaks its hard to even play the game. Once War Thunder makes it easier to unlock aircraft, i will gladly give it a positive review.",

For me, the major downside is very slow research of last tier vehicles (that is unless you have premium accaunt) and sometimes unfair matchmaking, when you get spawned into a battle with vehicles 10 years older than everyone elses.  Still, I strongly recommend this game to everyone intersted in combat sims and WW2.",

            "review_text": "Having shifted from World of Tanks to this, there's a few obvious comparisons to be made. War Thunder has better graphics, which you can even see from the trailers, and is well optimised for varying machines. War Thunder's damage models, whilst initially confusing ('but I'm sure I hit them, shouldn't they be dead?'), makes kills hugely satisfying, as well as increases a skill ceiling that in WOT felt capped by the huge simplifications Wargaming made.  Pros: - Tanks (and sensible ones) - no starting with terrible pre-war crap in this game, you are straight into the Panzers. - Tiering System - seems far less arbitrary and random than equivalent games - There's Planes. As a tank fanatic, I was sceptical, but the air battles are actually hilarious fun, mostly because everyone is pretty bad, leading to aerial nonsense. - Good Damage Models - Modules and weak spots make blowing tanks up satisfying - Relative Realism - at least compared to other comparable games. Ammunition types abound. - Vehicle continuity. Comparison: War Thunder has five different versions of the Panzer IV tank, and modifications to each have only small effects. World of Tanks decided to lump the Panzer IV into three versions, in which you have to grind to unlock new equipment for each, which radically change the tank's performance. War Thunder thus allows new players in a tank to not be hugely overwhelmed when they fight their first battle in a particular tank or plane. - Less grinding/more sensible unlock system - While still in linear trees, War Thunder's vehicles can be unlocked by XP gained in any other battle, meaning you don't have to grind in a tank you don't like to reach one you do. It also feels like progression is more swift in this game. - Less P2W - Other games of a similar type often tend to hide specific vehicles (usually more powerful or unbalanced ones) behind pay walls. I have yet to encounter this, and I certainly haven't felt like premium vehicles are better than standard ones. - Tanks can Drift - No explanation really needed. If you want to slide 20 tons of steel sideways round a corner and try a no-scope, you do it. It probably won't work, but it will look awesome. - Maps are big - Another comparison to World of Tanks. WOT forces you down narrow alleys and specific kill-zones to guarantee combat. War Thunder does not, instead providing varied terrain, and satisfying across-map shots can occur.  Cons: - Some matchmaking seems ridiculous. Tier 1 German tanks cannot fight T-34s at all, yet can end up in the same matches. Really, War Thunder's tier structure should be more rigid, and keep to single tier games. - Russian stuff seems a little more powerful than it should. Particularly planes, which seem to have miniguns instead of machine guns, which never jam to boot. - The Community isn't poisonous, but it certainly isn't going to help you in game. For a team-based game, expect an astounding lack of cohesion. - Artillery in ground battles. Some vehicles can call it in, and its not very well balanced, because some matches degenerate into camping with artillery. - Some Tank matches also degenerate into spawn-camping. Particularly those with more open spawns, or single spawn points. The aforementioned artillery can also target these areas.  Despite it's flaws, War Thunder has thus far proven very entertaining. There's a nice blend of realism and gaming, with a satisfyingly high skill ceiling. It takes a while to get your head round it, and it is sometimes rage-inducing, like any other game, but I have not regretted transitioning to this game at all.  8/10 - Fun and well-designed, needs more polish.",

It has really in-depth mechanics that pertain to real-life, but also have some stuff that are in the game to make it fun.  It's a free-to-play game, and it runs GREAT. You don't need a good PC to run this above 60 fps, you can probably use an office computer to play this and get 40+ fps on min.  You can pick from various countries that were in World War 2. Japan, Germany, United States, UK, and Russia.  It's based on multiplayer, but there are some single player missions and some that you can play with your friends, and there's also a mission editor.  A lot of things can happen in this game, like, your wing being shot off, or your pilot being knocked out. You can even do a 'soft landing' and get XP for that in case you get shot down.  You can play with friends and invite them to your group, or 'squad' and you and your wingman can play in various things. You can even make a squadron eventually, but that costs a bit.  Also, the soundtrack is pretty good, it's a reminder of those WW2 air combat movies.  Also, since it's a free-to-play, there's no risk in trying.  If you've ever wanted a WW2 plane sim mixed with modern multiplayer elements, just download it.",

Gaijin have done all the right moves w/ this game, until recently. The matchmaking got so bad that i took a 7 month hiatus b/c it was just so broken, when i returned however i had one of the most fun experiences i've had while playing.  Now lets get into the actual review:  I'm going to start w/ just some pros and cons, then move on to gameplay, followed up by graphics, and finally sum up the main points and say my personal opinion w/ some facts.  Pros: &gt; Lots of WWII - Vietnam war era vehicles &gt;Accurate Damage Models and Rounds ( rarely) &gt;Nice graphics &gt;4 gamemodes and lots of maps &gt;Good realistic Aviation and Tank sim ( I'd recommend DCS or IL-2 Stumorvik for flyers)  Cons: &gt;Broken Battle Rating (I'll get to that later) &gt;Russian Bias (Again I'll get to it later) &gt;Paywalls for some game changing items (I'll get to it later) &gt;Lots of grinding (For some this might be a pro)  Gameplay:  Now War Thunder's gameplay is... unique. Sometimes you'll end up with a perfect match e.g Tigers, T-34 / IS's and / or M4 Shermans but other times you get a match which pit's Tiger II's against Matilda II's.  Now the battle rating system is quite clever it keeps certain era tanks / planes from fighting higher / lower era tanks / planes, but it has gone to crap these past few months e.g BR 5 vehicles going up against BR 6-6.7 vehicles.  Ahh... Russian Bias  Graphics:  Now the graphics in this game are stunning, presuming you are running everything on max and have a beefy computer. There is however a small, tiny, miniscule flaw, if you play on the lowest graphics it COMPLETELY REMOVES FOILAGE! Meaning that players who might not have the best PC have a distinct advantage but, of cause, there are the people who use it so they can have a easy view on whats happening behind that bush.  Main Points:  - This game is terrible for it's matchmaking - The graphics on a high end PC are great - There are small bugs w/ the graphic system - It is only for people who love grinding  Conclusion: I would recommend this game to people who don't mind spending 700+ hrs grinding, overlook the bad matchmaking, and WW2 enthusiasts  i give this game a ♥♥♥♥ blyad / idi nahui  7/10",

            "review_text": "Yeah, I hate this game. Not because of Russian and British bias, although it is kinda there, but for the obvious money-grabbing  Higher tiers make you lose money: In the lower tiers, tanks are easy to replace and destroying an enemy tank rewards you around 1000 lions, so you only have to destroy one or two tanks to cover the repair cost of your tank. But this changes once you get to around tier 3. For instance, a German Tiger H1 requires a whopping 4600 lions to repair, and killing an enemy tank is still only worth around 1000. That means to just simply COVER the repair cost of losing a Tiger, you have to destroy FIVE enemy tanks. And that's not even to make a profit, that's to get your Tiger back at the end of this ♥♥♥♥ stained road.  Premium tanks: What a suprise, an MMO where you can spend money to be better than other people. Pay us a large sum of real money and we'l give you a Calliope American rocket tank, filled with 30-something rockets that can be fired without reloading and can pen basically any armor of your BR. Have fun.  BR squishing: Recent updates have made it so tanks of absurdly high BR are now fighting lower tanks. So now light tanks with a battlerank of 2.3 are now duking it out with tanks having a battle rank of 4.7. You tell me who probobly wins.  Planes are dead: This is really, really sad. The game started with a really engenious system to planes and air battles and still remains decent. But recently, as War Thunder added tank combat, they left behind the GOOD part of WT with air battles and now make ♥♥♥♥♥♥, poorly made and obviously bias tank games. A waiting list for a tank battle will be around a few hundred people. For an air battle, it's around eleven.  Saddest part: These flaws are litterally the only reason people keep playing, because of BR squishing and the loss of the mighty plane, most players with high BRs are all too happy to go fight a bunch of players who have just started the game. In short, making the entire thing like the gaming version of a pyramid scheme. Those who played the game first get all the benefits, those who are just starting get slaughtered and then leave the game like I did.  If you're a masochist, have fun. Make sure to pick Russian tanks and British planes, they're the only ones worth playing.",

I went back to this game so I could practice with it. I suck with this joystick. It has to be 75% harder than using a mouse. It's frustrating when I have such a hard time while other players with a mouse are casually shooting me down.   However, since it is very difficult, once you finally shoot down a player, it brings one hell of a statisfaction. When you struggle so hard to play the game and you finally kill someone, my god, it brings an amazing feeling. This is the Dark Souls of aviation. Also, the opening song is absolutely amazing. It's constantly in my head. I feel like a champion while I'm playing this game. It's truely an exciting game to be playing.

For people who can't afford to buy ingame money with your real cash, stay calm, because so far I have not wasted any of my real money and I am often the best in my team. You have the option to fly a bomber if you want to erase the enemy base, I prefere fighters. You can also pick between the 5 countries: British(my favorite), Japan(fast, but the damage is as good as throwing rocks at them) German, Russia and US. But at the end of the day, if you pick any country its a win win situation. I am makeing it sound like you can only choose 1, no you can play with all of them. The costumisation on planes is nice, but you cant use very many different ''stickers'', you can always buy the stickers, but that will cost real money. (you can still costumise and make your plane unique). If you are new to the game, then don't worry, they teach you how to fly the plane very well in the tutorials. Also, there are many youtubers with helpful information. The game has tanks, I tried that, but didn't really enjoy it. Just the planes is good for me. Overall the game looks pretty and plane gameplay is the best I know of. The game is free (a true bargain), try it.",

Great game over all if you are into historical or plane simulators. In arcade mode the only thing limiting your respawn is the number of vehicles you have, and the time left in match. Realistic mode you only have one plane and one life. When entering realistic battles make sure you have the plane you plan on using selected before selecting the battle, for some reason, you can only use the plane you have selected ahead of time the others are 'unavailable for this mission,' not sure if this is a glitch or not but it does not affect gameplay when you are in the sky.",

Gaijin has added more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and its this new Activate Order thing were a player can challenge the other players to get a in game acheivment for a prize but the players who use are the best players in the match and they know they will get it and the prize is normally twice the amount of silver lions that is normally given for the acheivment and the match I was in the player using this was the top player in the match and he would set these up when he was in a perfect positon where he would be able to fullfill the requirements quickly so that is more B-U-L-L-S-H-I-T added to this game that is a large pile of it already. I have found in my recent time playing that some people are using illegal mods and hacks and i know this because i witnessed it on my team when a player shot down a plane a 10 km away with one shot from a 50 cal MG that is a illegal modding but Gajin is too lazy to enforce the rules so it became like those free FPS game with a lot of hackers and illegal modders. This game has also turned into COD with the number of achievements you can get for doing nothing my game lagged for the first 30 seconds of a match and I got 5 assists and when I got a kill on an enemy tank after I fired 10 shots into him it gave me the One Shot achievment which is given to people that one shot someone well I didn't one shot him but I still got it.",

The developers seemingly are the most biased people on earth. This is no simulator. This is a pure glorification of russian tanks and planes, i've never seen a game soo far from realism. Russian tanks have higher explosive damage. For example if you compare a russian shell and a german shell the russian one will ALWAYS do more explosive damage inside the tank.  Then there is that thing called 'matchmaking'. Apparently Gayjin is too ocupied with searching through 'Sikrit Docjumants' from the allmighty Ussr, written by Stalin with his own blood that they just think that throwing Post-War tanks against Late-War german tanks is fun. Is4 vs Tiger II, guess who wins.   Then there are these stats...So seemingly a Traktor engine is a more capable Aircraft engine than a engine exactly build for the purpose of being an Aircraft engine. Yaks are WAY too fast and manuverable.  I am sorry to say that I can't speak alot about the Japanese/American/British tanks/planes since I don't know alot about them. But an Me-262 was known for it's speed, but apparently those 'Sikrit Docjumants' they found said, that the glorious scientists of the most developed country in the world at that time found out, the Me-262 is worse in climbing and speed than a bomber.  I could go on and on and on about this ♥♥♥♥ they call realism. Maybe it is realism in the equal country of the free will where sometimes someone is a little more equal than other people.But please...if you decide to play this game..don't spend a dime on this..don't...just don't..I beg you.",

That aside- they treat these planes as if they're made of bubble gum and spit. A single burst from some planes will rip a wing off .. which only happened to the Zeros due to their lack of armor. Another plane you get in and the tail gets shot off by a single burst. Long story short, the game seems to have no tier seperation, if it does it needs to be tightened. A bi-plane vs a P-51 is a crap match up. The damage rates are stupid and not relistic at all. American planes were high in armor and could take several hits withut issue. A piolt getting knocked out in a plane with two piolts shouldn't cause you to crash. The loading screen tells about how a plane can fly with 1/2 a wing..but when you end up with 1/2 a wing and can still control it the game will boot you out automaticly after 10 seconds so what good is the knowledge? I've almost landed and repaired a damaged plane several times if the damn game would let me.",

            "review_text": "Warthunder, more like Grind-thunder, this game IS the definition of grind, ever played MMO's before? well this makes them look like a freaking casual game, grind wise. Hoping to get jets like phlydaily or baronvongamez? Lol, no, its impossible. Even if you do try to, the ludicrous amounts of research needed for one jet (almost 300K Research) is insane. Pair this ludicrous amount of research with the extremely low RP per match (around 1.5K RP, and thats if you are in first place with pretty much ALL the kills.). i did some math, yes, math, and it would take at that rate (assuming you DID get that much per match EVERY match) it would take aroudn 600 matches of arcade mode, YES 600 hundred. thats for one jet. one. Not to mention that there is SO much grind that even if you did manage to pull yourself together and grind through all 600 matches, its more like 1-2,000 because most matches you really only get around 500-700 RP. ALSO, dont exectt gaijin 'entertainment' to fix these problems , because they aren't, I have played in a TIER ONE biplane (germans) not to mention a reserve biplane, and saw an AIROCOBRA (last bit of T2, borderline T3) fighter plane destroying EVERYBODY. Why you ask am i being matched with an almost T3 plane? Only God knows, but oh, maybe, its their $h177y matchmaking system ( aka BR) meaning that if your a reserve plane (1 BR) you can get matched with a 2 BR plane, (T2) this is so incredibly stupid. This paired with russian and british bias, more on that in a sec, combines to make a incredibly unfair , and not fun experience. The russians and British planes (russian tanks later) Are SO over powered that is makes all other planes look like snails with peashooters, for example, the russian 'ishak' AKA turn faster than you and shoot you with KV2 shells, plane. This plane is so stupidly unbalanced that a few of them, yes a few, there are more than one, can turn basically faster than a biplane, and pack an insane weapon payload all of which are capable of one shotting/obliterating your plane. Oh and dont even get me STARTED on the spitfires, oh wait, i am, the spitfires are probably one of those planes that you see, and run away going NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE, because, the spitfires pack around 6+ machine guns of around 12mm calibur, and turn at around a biplane status (they also go into up to T3-4, meaning that your king cobra, (slow turn time) WILL get rekt by these spitfires, because they can quite literally turn circles around you) Note that the british tree basically consists of spitfires, and the only british planes you will EVER see in a match are spitfires, and wellingtons. Take note of this though, i will continue playing this game ONLY because there is no other game with this timeline with planes/tanks (no world of tanks for me) . I will never play realistic/sim battles JUST for the fact that they take around 30 minutes to an hour to finish (no joke) and there are NO bonus research / money in this game mode , take that into consideration when in arcade you can basically make 4 times the research in about a fifth of the time, HOWEVER im not saying that by any means you can make large amounts of RP 'fast' in this game. no no, you will waste away your life trying to grind away the tiers to get that one jetplane that you want, at the time of writing, ive spent 150 hours of my life on this terribly unbalanced game. All in all though, i cannot recommend this game for people who just want a quick bit of fun before you would go do something else (double action boogaloo is much better suited for this, and is actually FUN).

            "review_text": "Let me say that while this says I have only 20-something hours on record, I've been playing it for months and months before it came to steam.  First of all, I've invested hundreds into this game. DO NOT DO THIS. I bought the bloody eagles to convert to experience for my flight crews. Leveling them up creates no visible advantage over another player. You're essentially wasting your eagles. Buying the upgrades creates no visible advantage, with the exception of more guns, different ammunition and more bombs. Since the 1.37 patch, not only is your eagle now less valuable than a peso, you get far less return from them, which is more like a great big 'PlSS OFF' from Gaijin.  The new leveling system is the exact opposite from what they promised. Instead of making leveling up easier, they've placed all the aircraft into 5 tiers now, and you must now research each plane individually, instead of just having access to purchase the planes you level into. But don't fret: After you research the planes and parts, you still have to buy them. This has slown the previously percieved grind into the equivalent of pusing a car uphill. While in park. And with all flat tires. With six Ralphie May's sitting in it. And three dead bodies in the trunk.  COMMUNICATION. This is key to maintaining teamwork and winning any engagement. However, when you are in the middle of a dogfight, this is impossible, as they have STILL NOT IMPLIMENTED any form of voice communication. Typing in the middle of a dogfight equals death. Hence the term 'typekill'.  PLANES. Gorgeous planes. Beautiful selection(When you finally unlock one). However, most of the battles boil down to who has the most bombers. Not really much balance in that aspect.  This game is like a beautiful woman: No matter how pretty she is, someone somewhere is tired of her ♥♥♥♥.   Final Straw: After engaging in a conversation in the game's chat rooms with others, expressing our disdain for how abyssmal the grind and lack of true dogfighting this game contains, and how this game feels more like a chore now than an actual form of entertainment, I have been banned from chat for the offense of, and I'm quoting, 'Insulting the developers.'   UPDATE: So at the beckoning of a few fellow gamers, I reinstalled the game to test out the much anticipated tanks. Someone had mentioned in reviews that the simulator battles in the flying part of the game were broken, because they would go on for long periods at a time, and would almost exclusively be Germany vs Russia. Well, the only tanks available are from either Germany or Russia. Tested the tanks. The T50 is by far the most overpowered tank in Tier I vehicles. Almost completely covered in 40MM armor, there are only a few tanks that can actually penetrate the armor, let along damage the tank. The T50 belongs in Tier II at the earliest in the game, and if you find yourself in a match against three of them, consider the match lost. Don't get me started on that goddam ZIS - 30. Three DIRECT hits on one of the most lightly armored vehicles in the game, and it still won't die. Can't say I should really be surprised, that Russian tanks in a game run by Russian developers would be so strong.",

I can still kill you though. 1.37 changed a lot of things, but the core is still there. The BR system is not great, but still works and is changing all the time as they gather data. It is no flight simulator, there is a mode for it, but it is not to the extent IL2 is. The game is great and I recommend.

Pricing well below what you might find in other Free-to-Play games. Nothing in it is really 'pay to win'. The usual cosmetic stuff and some boosts to help you level faster. It really is dirt cheap for boosts, though.  The game itself is very fun. While the main mode is arcade there is a harder historic battles mode and full realism simulation mode. These modes are very populated.... getting into games is quick. (Especially if you choose to play on any region. Lag issues seem to not matter much at all.)  At the moment there is a very good selection of planes to fly covering a wide variety of playstyles. Bombers, fighters, dive-bombers, and so on. Damage modelling is very neat and immersive. Flight model in arcade is fun and easy to adjust too. Realism model is challenging for anyone who would enjoy a sim of this sort.  The game is fun. I think anyone looking to shoot planes could easily jump into this game and find themselves going back to it again and again. I know I do.  A+ would recommend.",

I thought I was extremely skilled since I shot down multiple enemy aircrafts while bombing multiple ground targets simulatenously. However, as maneuverable as my plane was, I was shot down by a far superior winged beast that had jet engines, my old ww1 plane was no match.   As I tumbled into the ground, I pulled my chutes. I landed on the ground, found a tank and drove around. Looking for enemies to shoot down but as an experienced pilot my skills had not translated into tanks and I was unable to control it, the tank was blown to peices. Unable to breathe, I blacked out.   I awoke in a hospital where the doctors looked at me, then at each other nodding their heads with disapproval. Many many years had gone by and I was unaware of how many battles I had been in and survived. I had won the lottery each time! Every near death experiences honed my skills, drove my ego, made me into a battle hardened veteran of the skies. I was invicible, until one day. I was flying around in my newly aquired jet engine plane and saw a poor fellow in a slow ww1 plane. I saw a reflection of myself, in my youth as I used to mindlessly rush the enemies and had no tactics or arieal maneuvers.   I hesitated for a brief moment, but realized this was an endless cycle of life and death. Mercilessly, I destroyed his slow and flimsy aircraft and put a huge distance between us. As he was plummeting to the ground and I was soaring across the skies, our eyes met for a breif moment, I saw the rage, the fraustration and the look of defeat in his eyes. I knew he wasn't gonna die. I knew at the back of my head, he would get his revenge one day.   Then I got rammed by another plane.   10/10 would get rammed again.",

I have spent around $300 on this game over a few years. I regret nothing. It is the best free to play game i can think of. Grindinf used to be easier pre 1.31 if i can recall but it is still easy to grind and you get free daily XP boosters that can boost you up to 500%. If you fork over about $20 you can get a high tier premium with a limited premium account and all you need to do is get one kill in an RB battle and you will easily make 11000 XP points. But the cool thing is you can go without spending money and still grind effectivly. The best part of this game is the historical acrruacy and the great detail in flight models, weapons, and damage models. Note tanks are not arcady and if you are looking for a really simple type of tank game go over and spend time at War Games World of Tanks. But if you want a beautiful looking game with amazing gameplay and intense tactical tank and aircraft combat you have come to the Right place.  Do not be scared to give War Thunder money, the updates are amazing and are worth supporting the devs. But if you cant afford it.... dont be worried its still easy to grind and there are often free events with easy tasks to unlock premium planes or even you get 'battle trpheys' which can give you discounts or even perminant 100% XP boosters (tailsmen) that are bound to a certain random aircraft in the country you are using.   good luck and have fun hope this review helped any one on the edge of wondering if they want to play this great game.",

I've made it to several Jets in American tree, and am almost to Jets in Germany and British. I've had plenty of fun and as I learned my planes strengths, even the planes people call bad serve me well. Later I bought some premium bundles for really cool planes like the BF 109 G-2, and the A6M5-Ko Reisn that also came with a whole two weeks premium time AND golden eagles that I saved for MORE premium time. Well, I bought the British Mustang Mk.1 because that Mustang is just a boss, the ONLY Mustang with Cannons and it kicks ♥♥♥!   Bottom line here is pick it up, have fun, fly your plane the way it's supposed to be flown don't try to turn fight everything after Tier 1 unless you pick a turn fighter nation like Russia or Japan.

I have a Logitech Attack 3 joystick and its buttons were not recognized by the game on startup so I had to reassign all of the bindings, but that was the only problem that I encountered so far. I seriously recommend this game to anyone who has an interest for historical aircraft, and its free-to-play, so why not?",

            "review_text": "I have to say that while i sometimes enjoyed the dogfights there are some issues that make this game unplayable for me:  1. utterly long pauses  when getting shot you have to travel back to base in order to repair, something that usually takes as long as the match itself, so there really is no point in doing so and throwing yourself into enemy fire is much more effective.  Sometimes when respawning the action is so far away, that you have t travel several minutes  2. controls There are a lot of different control modes in this game, and while it sounds great it's actually the problem. Playing with mouse-aim is so ridiculously easy compared to gamepad or keyboard that doing the letter just gets you shot down.  But mouse-aiming doesn't feel at all like flighing a plane because of the lacking difficulty and is just plain boring. The only game mode that prohibits mouse-aim is the simulator mode and seamed to be way too complicated.  3. untransparant leveling I am not an expert in aviation, i just wanted to have some fun flighing a fighter. but then there are so many different planes to lvl with no explanation but a LOT of numbers that don't mean ♥♥♥♥ to me although i am an aerospace engineering-student.  4. matchmaking I haven't played too much but it seemes to be a known issue. One game feels quite great and leveled, the next is like shooting fish in a barrel. But then i get thrown in a game and before I'm even in range i get shot down with 2 hits (usually takes about 10-15) and the enemys are unbelievably manouverable.   So NO, too many issues",

The level of graphical detail and attention to small things make this game visually amazing. Gaijin overall puts considerable effort in affording historical accuracy more or less to most of the game and does alot of justice to much of the content. Minor bugs or inconsistancies in menu's or squads is to be found wanting and some balence concerns among the differing nation's vehicles do exist. The new ground forces mode is really sharp and the graphics engine plus great sound effects and noise of war give the battlefield a new and sharp distintive view that no other game has yet to approach in this genre.   Overall this game is very fun and anyone even considering it should give it a go to see if it's for you. War Thunder offers a giant selection of planes and a modest start to ground forces availible for minimal effort to hop in and enjoy something cool. The real expection, personally above aircraft, will be the upcoming naval portion as there will be rediculous possibility on how Gaijin will execute this and how the balencing and damage model is implemented on a sharper scale than currently present with ships as-is. Hopefully the test for that will begin soon :D Fly Safe!",

And I have to say that in a superficial comparison between WT and World of Tanks, this game definitely comes out on top. There's more dedication to gameplay and detail, the damage mechanics are superior and the potential for individual input in a match is much greater. In WoT you play tier 6 and get into tier 8 matches ten games in a row, GG. WT never takes it's unfairness to this level and overall seems much less determined to crush and destroy it's players.  That said, the game is still trying to destroy you. The gameplay and business model has something fundamentally bullying and wrong about it. I can't play either game for more than ten minutes without raging.  The adagium 'All companies exist to make money, but you don't have to be a ♥♥♥♥ about it' springs to mind. It's not that I mind bullying generally. In PVP for Dark Souls or EVE online there are endless bullies; it's practically the reason people play. But even the maxed out bullies get taken down every now and then, the mechanics and psychology of the game lend themselves to that. There is no such comeuppance in WT, taking down a bully is nothing special.  Gajin crafts an illusion of significance, as is standard for any F2P experience. The mystery box is empty, you're not supposed to 'finish' the game and there is no reward for doing so. You only get rewards for logging in daily and playing one more match. They made their machine and it's working perfectly. They don't even care to cheat. By definition a cheater is still playing the game with you, they're still interacting with you in a meaningful way. Gajin allows for no such interaction. Pay gold or don't, git gud or don't, what's it to them?",
