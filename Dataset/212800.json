Grab your baseball cap and loosen your pants, it's time to fight endless hordes of enemies and collect every weapon crate you can.",

While 'free' means ALL of the FEATURES of the game) I don't see any part/weapons or stuffs that needs 'real money' to get it.  Gameplay's very simple; run, hide, shoot, repeat, don't get killed by those monsters/your own weapon (i.e: disc bullet, fire), and get those crates. Go for a highscore, unlock arenas, weapons, and random characters.  I have 1 problem. TOO SIMPLISTIC. If you've unlocked all unlockables, it would be boring to repeat gameplay. You guys should add another gamemodes in DLC/free updates. It's OK for DLC releases which would cost around 10 cents/1 dollar as long as it add gameplay, or maybe Storyline?",

The gameplay is really fast paced and is very fun. This is one of those games that I could lose hours to because it has that 'just one more unlock' feel to it. The weapons are pretty unbalenced, as mentioned by another reviewer, but I think that that ADDS to the game because you have to constantly change your strategy and it makes you more desperste to get to the next crate. It is also COMPLETELY FREE (to my knowledge) so there is NO EXCUSE not to pick this up right now and start playing it! It could use more player characters though, like if the developer could get some kind of license to Duke Nukem or Doomguy, it would be awesome to see those two again in a good game. Or if some kind of pixel 'blood' was added.",

It annoys you out of your mind especially when youve beaten your records or have a really high score and it crashes in the middle of you playing and you lose it all. This also makes it take much longer to unlock all of the weapons. However the constant crashing makes you want to play even more to triumph and say that you finnally beat the computer.   Also If you like this game go and buy the iOS game Muffin Knight. This is a copy of that game, even though that one is better.  All in all I give it 9/10 because of all of the crashing.
