Then you can help save them from sunlight, silver bullets and hired assassins by guiding them to their lairs.  - You don't? Great!! Then you can guide them into sunlight, silver bullets and hired assassins to your hearts content.   Whether you love or hate them, Vampires: guide them to safety is a fun and challenging puzzle game that's great to kill a few minutes or even spend an hour or two on. With increasingly difficult chapters which add new dangers and new tricks to use, it's certainly no walk in the park. More like a walk in a cemetary, at night, in the fog..... with odd sounds and a wolf howling.",

            "review_text": "While this is a puzzle game, logic will only get you so far in it. Finding a solution to a puzzle is but a small part of gameplay: you then have to implement it. It's real-time, and most of the challenge comes from having your attention divided and having to time your clicks just right, which is never something I want to see in a puzzle game. Results can be unpredictable, which means there's a fair bit of trial and error involved. It gets even worse when the game starts introducing randomization in the pathfinding, ensuring that you  can't  work out a solution ahead of time.",
