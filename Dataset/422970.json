            "review_text": "I've seen many reviews referring to Devil Daggers as a bullet hell. 'But why?' I said. 'There's no projectiles other than the ones you shoot.' I started thinking about it; and I came to realize this:  Instead of bullets, the squids shoot skulls at you. Instead of lazers, the spiders suck up your power gems and shoot spider eggs at you.  At this point, I figured that Devil Daggers was a bullet hell without the bullets, and the game's graphics, gameplay, and audio represent that well. Bullet hell without the bullets is just hell.  And God, do I love it so.",

Not unlike the modern DOOM, Devil Daggers forgoes multiple arenas for a single floating platform, one that you will exist on for the entirety of the game.   Constant action and a running timer lends itself to repeatedly attempt again and again, trying to best your previous time. Leaderboards with an intuitive UI allows quick viewing of replays of the top players, giving you the insight to the deeper strategy layer that permeates this game from the beginning. The sound design blends both an atmospheric and immersive experience while simultaneously giving off vital information. A tremendous game, and a must-buy at such a low price.",

            "review_text": "STATICKINETICS TLDR Review:  Devil Daggers is too cheap. This game is more entertaining than many $60 blockbusters I've played. Why? There is something so satisfying about a game that is effeortlessly fluid, precise, rewarding and punishing. Devil Daggers is a large middle finger to the AAA industry that wants to hold your hand and make you feel good and warm inside. This game is punishing but because the game's entire purpose is to challenge you to best yourself or your friends, it is satisfying to no end. It feels ♥♥♥♥ing great to clear a stage of the game, to do so faster and more efficiently than last time, or to beat your friend's score. This game will take you through an emotional roller coaster but it will also make you feel like you actually did something meaningful with your time.  Fans of the Dark Souls series or old-school Arena shooters will love it.",

            "review_text": "First off, extra kudos for the Linux build that works out of the box!  There are so many details about this game that keep me playing over and over, I'll do my best to list some of them.  The visuals are reminiscent of Quake 1, polygons seem to twitch around as if they can’t be contained, textures shift slightly as if it’s hiding something else. These minor details of 90’s 3D simply add to the vague details where you’re not quite fully sure of what exactly is in front of you. Your brain fills in the details with nightmarish extras where you don’t want to know what it is, but natural human curiosity demands that you must know, no matter the cost.  On the gameplay side of things it’s straight forward and simple. Moving/jumping around is smooth and there isn’t any time where I get skull’ed and feel like it was the controls fault, everything you do is on you. Shooting is a mixture of rapid and burst fire. While I don’t have it fully nailed down yet, there is a learning curve on how to use both effectively in whatever situation is before you.  Sounds, oh my the sounds. I find every sound that is in the game is in there for a reason to inform you about some horror coming your way. At no point do I feel my ears are getting overloaded and I’m always able to keep track of whats coming from where. There isn’t any music and I’m very ok with that, music might over do it and then make it hard to keep track of whats going on. If I’m ever in the mood I’ll que up my own music.",

            "review_text": "This is one of the greatest games I've ever played and also one of the most simple.  You start the game in an arena with a shiny dagger in front of you. Pick up the shiny dagger and chaos ensues. This title hearkens back to a time when all we cared about was high scores in games, and the funny thing is that I can't remember the last time I've been so addicted to a title. The other thing is that it's 5 bucks, I mean skip coffee or your favorite sugary drink for 1 day and you have the money for it.  There are no levels, no difficulty settings, and no special weapons. Although you can power up your daggers with gems that the bigger enemies drop, this is about the only thing that changes throughout the course of the game to help you. The rest of the game changes to destroy you as time goes on :)  This game reminds me of why so many games nowadays reach too far or are just too complicated. Who gives a crap how complicated a game is if the core of it doesn't stand up? Well this game is all core and no frills and I just can't stop playing. Every run is a chance to show yourself how good your reactions, strategy, and aim is. This is just pure game.  Get it. Now.",

            "review_text": "Devil Daggers is fast, snappy, frustrating, maddening, terrible, wonderful, and hellish.   The game is simple. Stay alive for as long as you possibly can while fighting off Hell's armies in a dim, dark, purgatorial arena, with nothing but your rapid-fire daggers and your (hopefully sharp) reaction times. Harkening back to late 90's games such as Quake, the movement system is extremely satisfying. Of course, you have standard movement with WASD and your mouselook, but once you get the general hang of the game, you can introduce bunny-hopping and dagger jumping into your repetoire. These systems reward you with speed and manueverability that can turn average, 'nothing special' runs into challenges to the world's top players. While not as snappy as one might like, its movement system just feels right at home here, and is immensely satisfying.   Truth be told, I'm not even that big of a fan of wave-based survival games. Sure, I've played and enjoyed games like Geometry Wars, (which, admittedly, is very similar to Devil Daggers IMO, just from an entirely different perspective,) but none of them have held my attention quite like Devil Daggers has. While a hefty portion of this addictive nature comes from the game just being fun as all hell, it's also partly due to the leaderboard system. Quite a few friends of mine picked up the game when it came out, and we slowly started ramping up our challenges to each other. Thirty second survival became seventy, seventy became one-twenty, and so-on and so-forth. I've swore up and down, I've shrieked like a small child upon near misses with skulls, and have had my feet tapping in anticipation beneath my desk, all because my best time was MILLISECONDS off my friend's best, and I was  so  close. Admittedly, they've all moved onto other games, and I finally hold the crown at 427 seconds. But... given that my record is about 70 seconds shy of the coveted Devil Dagger status, I can't just stop there, can I?  In addition to being one of the most fun games I've played this past year, it's an amazing looking and sounding game. I'm a complete fanatic for PSX-style graphics. The blocky style, abysmal render distance, primitive lighting systems and poor aliasing admittedly looks awful by today's standards, but it's incredibly charming to anyone who grew up with a Playstation One in their home. Devil Daggers effortlessly merges the look of a late-run PSX game with an aesthetic similar to Quake and a mid-90s Slayer album cover, and it always looks fantastic. At this point, with some research, I could probably write a scientific paper on why I love this visual style so, so much, but I'll keep that toned down for this.  If there's one aspect of Devil Daggers that absolutely must be talked about, it's the immaculate sound design. A satisfying sound is what makes the difference between a weapon being limp and forgettable, or powerful and an icon of an entire genre (see: the Super Shotgun from Doom II, or the AWP from any of Counter Strike's iterations.) Or, as another example, making the presentation of in-game reward boring and unfulfilling, or something that straight-up makes your day upon finding it. Sound is a big deal to me in just about every medium, but video game sound design, (especially in shooters,) is  extremely important . Devil Daggers sets a bar for what audio in video games should be.   Every crunch, splatter, and skitter has an unsettling bite to it that is distinct and clearly heard amidst the madness of the arena. Each enemy has a 'chatter' for when they are encroaching on your person, and getting dangerously close to ending your run for good. Enemy spawners have an ominous, low hum or a disgusting chitter to signify where they're coming from, or that yes, they are still there. Death rattles and screeches offer a triumphant, yet haunting finality to taking down a larger enemy. The sound of firing daggers grows from a machine-like drone to shrill screams of the damned with each upgrade you gain. And of course, above it all, Devil Daggers incorporates a positional 3D surround sound system, assisting the player in knowing where their next threat is without much difficulty. Everything is accounted for, it's satisfying, unsettling, and so, so good.  To make a send-up to 90's FPS games can be done by just about anyone with a Unity engine license. To make that same tribute by building your own engine, creating sound and art that is equally impressive and sinister, and designing one of the most immersive and entertaining arena shooters I've ever seen takes someone like Matt Bush, who did an incredible job with Devil Daggers as a whole.   At the end of the day, you can get either Devil Daggers or a nice burger for five US dollars. They'll both end up shortening your life-span in some form, and I mean that in the most sincere way possible.  UPDATE (11/23/2016): I'm awarding Devil Daggers my 'Just Five More Minutes' award, because, let's be honest here, I've put off class assignments for this game.",

            "review_text": " Robotron 2084  and  Quake  had an unholy union and produced a game Zdzislaw Beksinski would call beautiful.  You're a guy/gal in a small, dark arena with a glowing hand that shoots daggers, either in a steady, rapid stream or a shotgun-like blast (there's also homing daggers, but that's later). All around you are flying skulls, spider skulls, worm skulls, and more skulls. Destroy them in an effort to last as long as possible - high scores are measured in seconds (to four decimal places), and nothing else.  And it's  hard . Like, really damn   hard  . When you start out, you probably won't last much longer than 50 seconds for the first few plays as you learn the behaviors of the monsters, as well as the Do's and Don'ts of maneuvering in such a claustrophobic slice of Hell. It is a testament to this game's design, however, that with repeated play you will get noticeably better. There's more skill than luck involved in good play, and you'll start to wonder how you could ever manage the indignity of a 50-second time again as you start climbing to the 100, 200, 300 second marks and beyond. There is a method to the madness this game throws at you, one spooky wave after another, and it will pummel the method right into you.  Aesthetically, this game is  on point.  The art direction is a deliberate nod to  Quake  more than anything - I believe the developers said they were going for the feel of a ''90s shooter fever dream.' Sounds about right. The deliberately low-res graphics are brown and black and red all over (not a criticism - it fits right in), and the monster designs are as creepy as they are well-rendered. The sounds are of an auditory palette that is altogether eerie, otherworldly, and unsettling. Even the menu music is the sort of industrial nightmare that Trent Reznor could've whipped up.  The action itself is fluid, jank-free and suited to the pace this game expects of you. In further nods to  Quake  and its brood, there's bunny-hopping and 'rocket'-jumping (firing the dagger blast into the ground) to get around, though I've only found limited use for the latter. Top replays I've watched seem to reinforce this, unless I'm not watching closely enough.  If I have one knock against the game, it's that around the 500 second mark the game shifts into a sort of Thermonuclear Player-Must-Die mode which renders any times past that point more of a matter of luck than skill. Granted, the whole 'goal' of the game seems to be to last that long - 500+ second runs are highlighted in red on the leaderboards, and it's the requirement of the game's sole achievement, 'Devil Dagger.' I suppose that's just me wishing this could go on forever, or that the skill ceiling could be set even higher now that there's 5 players (as of March 1, 2016) who've surpassed the 500 mark, with two of them within just 15 seconds of 600 - I want to see just how far they can reach within this platform without it getting  too  unfair. However, for $5, reaching the 'goal' will give you a  lot  of bang for your buck.  If you like arcadey twitch-action shooters,   Devil Daggers   is probably the best bargain buy you can get on Steam. Highly recommended.",

Kill awful monsters, steal their crystals to boost your meager power, and NEVER STOP RUNNING.  It's a great game if you don't have a ton of time, but plenty of patience. Best part is, you can watch the top runs by the top players, learn from their methods, and get a glimpse of the insane fever-dream waiting for you beyond the ten-minute mark (which, as of this writing, only a few people have reached). Every bit of progress is sickly rewarding, and you'll find yourself diving in again and again if this game is your bag.  Devil Daggers: it's some kinda metaphor for adult life.

Gameplay is stripped down to the absolute bare minimum, there's only one goal; seemingly to stay alive for as long as possible. I think I would've enjoyed the game so much more if there was more to it, some levels to traverse instead of just a straight up endless wave survival mode, but for a game that's whole focus is being so ultra stripped down, it's hard to really fault the pure simplicity of it.

Paired with beautiful and morbid stylistic direction and art, this hearkens back to the likes of Quake, Diablo and DOOM, with it's gritty, enigmatic, demonic, occult, and somewhat Lovecraftian style.  This is a decently 'competitive', fast paced game that has tenfold more strategy and metagame than would would expect on the surface, especially for the small retail price tag of £3.99/$4.99 (which you can probably get for less regardless.). The game will test you, as you will test yourself, finding new strategies against the onslaught of demons with the very little and cryptic information that you are given. Learning nuance and piecing together the mannerisms of the demons. Learning sound cues with constant awareness as all of the otherworldly, demonic wails and cries mesh together (seriously, the sound design is stupidly well done, holy ♥♥♥♥) to create a brilliant cacophony you try to make sense of, marking your inevitable defeat.  Best of all? You will try, and try again until you rule out every single variable that you know to get just a dozen seconds more, until something new throws you off and makes your journey through hell even harder.  A must buy if you're into Quake, and if you crave an oldschool, hardcore 90s PC game vibe. A must buy if you want a game where you need to process dozens of different things in a handful of seconds. A must buy if you're looking for a game that will test your prowess.",

The first 20 deaths you experience will probably be within the first 45 seconds of the game. If you don't mind dying over and over and over and over just so that you can finally last over 1 minute then go ahead and buy this game. If you're easily frusterated, stay far far away. My only compalint is that the game is almost too hard. I haven't been able to experience a fraction of what this game has to offer because of not being able to last long enough. I want to see/hear all the monsters as they all have cool designs and make really eerie noises. But I'm afraid I'll never be able to last long enough to see everything.

There’s a fine line between fast paced and frustrating and continuously failing at the same point around 60 seconds in is very frustrating. This is long enough to make it hard to practice strategies against this specific enemy, and very bored of fighting the first few waves over and over. It also doesn’t help that the same enemy eats the crystals you need to upgrade the only weapon and it appears right before you have enough for the first one.  If you’re better at shooters than I am, perhaps you will enjoy it, but after over an hour I’m still no more than 60 seconds in, it’s more boring than fun. I’m sure there’s a lot more in this game, but I’ve only managed to see the first 4 enemies because the difficulty ramped up so quickly.  I would only recommend this for people who are hard core FPS fans that also happen to like retro Doom style graphics.

Which means wear headphones. This game is intentionally dark and the only means of knowing where the next swarm is coming from is audio qeues and the faint gleam of gemstones. The fantastic audio design makes me sweat even more balls as skeletors testicles are chattering mere inches behind me.  The gameplay is basic, and thats good. Its the Hotline Miami of shooters. You spray daggers faster than the beads of sweat will roll down your face or you double click to shotgun blast them.

You must kill everything the second it appears on your screen or die just moments later, the momentum of your 'lack of aim' will screw you over later on. I call it 'lack of aim' because the hitboxes of the enemies feels off and your bullets feel sluggish. Many times I have actually watched my bullets go through the target I'm trying to kill and I guess it just didn't register, pretty big flaw considering this IS an fps. You have to lead all your shots and your bullets feel very slow moving across the map, yet they shoot out of your hand quickly, doesn't really make sense. The game has a leaderboard and it does have some replay value based on that but this game needs some tweaks, the enemies need to move a little slower, the hitboxes of the enemies needs to be a bit bigger, your bullets need to move across the map a little faster, and they need to implement a toggle for crosshairs. I can't stand guessing where my bullets are going to go without some reticle. Until these changes are made I just can't really recommend this game. It gets very frustraiting to have your bullets just go through your target, and having to repeat the EXACT same 'sequence' over and over and over and over again to try and get back to where you were at. Even though the game isn't expensive I would still wait for it to go on sale.  Update: currently i am ranked 332 out of 73,102.

Again, none of that would have worked if it looked boring, but it doesn't look boring. It looks (and plays) like your own personal hell. However, it does have one flaw and that's the sound design. Some noises that the enemies make sound like people trying to imitate airplane and car sounds, which isn't as funny as it sounds when you consider that you are supposed to be fighting demons in an environment that could only be described as 'nightmarish'.  ...Okay I admit it, it was rather funny... but it didn't last!  There isn't much variety honestly, just the same area with the same monsters always located at the same spots.

The game is very fast paced and very fun movement-wise - you can for instance perform something called a 'dagger jump', which basically is a rocket jump, and it does seem like you gain some momentum by continously jumping (not sure though).   The music in the game is great (only plays in the menu). It brings back memories of Alone in The Dark and the old Resident Evil games. The sound design in general is actually very good. Everything really does sound hellish. The demons sound scary, the weapon sounds terrifying, the big spider skull enemy actually makes me uneasy. Different demons emit different sounds which makes it easier to telegrapgh where they are relative to your own position.  There are some issues woth the game though. The sound design is, as I just said, very good. Butt some sound effects blend in a little too much. There is a mechanic in the game where you have to collect red gems in order to upgrade your weapon. The game does not present how many gems you have collected (you need 10 for the first upgrade) and you have to count them yourself by listening to the little thump-like sound when they are picked up. However this sound effect is far from clear and it blends in with the background noise a little too easily.  Secondly the game lacks a proper options menu. The game would really benefit from some visual settings. Furthermore the games performance is rather iffy at times. I have an i5 4690k and an R9 280x and for some reason the game slows down a lot at times and at other times the game runs super smooth. It might very well be an isolated case.  Lastly the game only features one weapon (I'm not even sure what to call it). The weapon is upgradable, sure, but the upgrades don't really change all that much and it can get a little boring using the same gun over and over again.   I do recommend this game because I feel that I got my money worth and for 5 dollars you could do a hell of a lot worse.",

The game itself just starts up with you standing in front of a dagger and once you pick it up you are immidiately attacked by an array of 3 types of enemies which only get more and more difficult as the timer goes on, it can be extremely difficult for some people to even pass the 60 second mark.  Outside of that the game has no story, no secrets (unless you count figuring out how the game mechanics work) and nothing but the challenge of the game. In that respect it is a lot like super hexagon where the whole game is centered around beating your friends highscores and beating your own previous score. It should be said though, that the enemies do become predictable after some time and often you can tell immidiately when the new enemies are going to spawn so once you play the game a whole lot the beginning can become a bit tiring as you face the same pattern of beginning enemies again and again.  Altough i cannot verify one thing it does feel like the game is always using the same random seed per session, so you will always face the same pattern of enemies every round, i would count down the seconds between each enemy spawn because i had been repeating the same pattern over and over (3 spawners, 1 super spawner and then the skull spider with more super spawners).   However, despite that i have to say the game is exactly what i expected it to be when i got it and as such i am enjoying the nailbiting difficulty of it and i will probably play until i reach a point where i simply cannot beat my previous score.   Pros: - Really addicting and makes you want to constantly beat your previous score. - High speed movement and twitchy shooting makes the skill ceiling extremely high (tip: you can shotgun blast yourself up into the air) - The enemies are varied and are a constant challenge, however you can learn their patterns quite quickly - You will always want to dethrone your friends high score  Neutral points: - From what i've noticed the game seed is always the same. I cannot verify this but whenever i play the enemy spawn is always the same so learning patterns is sometimes part of the challenge.  Cons: - Everything you see in the trailer is all there is in the game. There are no secrets, no story no nothing so if you get bored of the base game then there is nothing to hook you back in - There is no fov slider and altough the fov is not bad it can still cause some people motion sickness and cause it so you can't see enemies coming from the side.",

The game itself is something of a reverse speedrun, where you are judged mostly by how long you can last, as well as how many enemies you can kill and the accuracy of your shots. If all of this is either acceptable or desirable to you as a player, than the rest of the game (art style, controls, fast restarts, etc.) is perfect, 10/10.",
