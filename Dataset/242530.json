The level of mechanics for such an old game is amazing. The diverse characters adds a lot of replayability. Steamworks integration allows Online Coop however, if you want to feel like a kid again, hook up two controllers and play locally.  Would definitely recommend picking up this game if you ever had it on older platforms, for those nostalgia trips and for those who love a good shooter.  Special power, FOOD!",

            "review_text": "I'm not sure if I am missing a large issue with this re-issue of this classic game, but the low metascore and bad reviews are something I just can not relate to or agree with at all. The Chaos Engine is a fantastic game that has a rock solid design, it is also one of the first games I ever played on the Amiga and was thrilled to see a remastered version released on Steam. Playing this again for the first time in about 18 years was the ultimate nostalgia trip. This game was way ahead of it's time, as was it's music.   Even though the game is still hard as hell, that isn't an issue to me, it just makes me even more determined to try and beat it again. With the addition of online play, leaderboards and achievements, the Steam version of this game gives you more of a reason to keep coming back to have a go at it.  There are some small issues with this port however, none of which are truly game-breaking but can be annoying. The main issue is the co-op play. 9 times out of 10 the game play is extremely choppy and make it very difficult to play properly, I believe a patch was promised for this and I really hope it comes along soon. Another thing that bothers me are some sound bugs that weren't present im the Amiga version. The sound of the the computer player teleporting to your location is elongated and high-pitched, it goes right through you now, especially after hearing it so frequently. The theme after completing a level is also bugged and doesn't play properly, instead it just cuts straight to the menu music, not a big deal at all but it's just something I noticed. It could just be my memory, but I'm sure that the monsters use the wrong death and pain sounds too, I don't ever recall the monsters using the same sounds as the player characters.   All in all, this is a good port of a great game and I definitely recommend it to old and new fans alike. There are some small issues but it doesn't make it any less of a great game. If nothing else in this game does anything for you, play it just for the soundtrack.",

A solid top-down shooter, adventure game that works great in 2 player, but sometimes frustrating in single with the AI player eating up lives and funds.  With 4 worlds, including 4 levels each, you rarely get bored with the content and start a new world just as you get to grips with the current library of enemies. The character classes are all fun in their own ways, with definite differences in firing coverage and special powers. Hours of fun!",

Still, I've always loved its steampunk aesthetics, cool mercenaries, killer soundtrack and of course, fun gameplay.  The game is best played with a friend and using Xbox controllers. I recommend investing on 2 controllers because it feels more natural to play it this way. It may not be ideal to some but since this is a classic topdown shooter game, the Chaos Engine demands it and trust me, it's worth it.",

The only reasons that I haven't uninstalled it are due to the nostalgia I get from playing it every now and then, as well as it's not taking up a lot of hard disk space. But seriously, you're better off downloading an emulator for the consoles and getting the rom if you're planning to play the game at all.  It's supposed to be a 'remastered' version of the original game, but little about this game seems 'remastered'. Pointless and useless features don't count, especially those that make the game look worse.  Online multiplayer is poorly optimized. The framerate drops drastically even if you're playing with a teammate sitting right next to you in the same room. As I have mentioned earlier, if you want to play with a friend, get the emulator and play local co-op. Unless playing Chaos Engine on 0.5x speed is a fine thing for you.  1/10 Would download Sega Mega Drive emulator and Chaos Engine rom again",

This game initially has everything going for it: Art style that fits in with modern indie titles, unique steampunk premise, local coop, brutal indie-esqu difficulty, interesting rpg-lite system of developing your character.  That being said, the game is only fun when playing with a friend. The combat is simply too devolved by today's standards to be worth a purchase for singleplayer. The perk of being able to use a controller with full 360 degree is a nice upgrade, but don't bother with this unless it is your mission in life to beat old hard games or you have a buddy who will sit down a play with you.   Overall, for what the game is trying to do (more tactical smash-tv with a campaign format) it is a 3/5 but I don't recommend getting it for the 10$ asking price.",
