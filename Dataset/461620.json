            "review_text": "The game requires a decent level of strategy, and is quite fun, but in its current state does not have much replay-ability, at least for me. For the price I paid (US$8), I am quite happy with my purchase, but am disappointed that I won't be playing much more of it.   EDIT: Having replayed this game since a MAJOR UPDATE, many of the issues I had detailed below have been fixed.    My experiences and criticisms are set out below:  I found myself identifying with many of the challenges faced by another reviewer (Saint Ceo de la Vegas), where in both my playthorughs, I started the game on easy, and in that setting I found the challenges within the 'settlement screen' difficult, but achievable. I managed to unite my region, amass (what I thought was) a substantial army, was constructing buildings quickly and in line with technological advances.   However, as soon the game shifted to an Egypt-wide emphasis ('fog of war map'), any progress I had made seemed woefully limited. The challenges to build, explore, unite and fight cities were just too substantial.   I completely shifted all production to military in order to attempt to build an army that could come close to taking on Seth (or at least defend myself against Seth, which I was able to do), but still couldn't come close to having enough soldiers for this. I was able to unite 4 or 5 tribes at this level, build a 3k + strong army, but I never felt in a position to even confront the smallest Seth settlement.   I was totally unable to build several of the special tombs due to lack of exploration at this point (despite having more than enough workers and resources) ... it just came down to timing and exploration, I wasn't fast enough and the game punished me for it, this can be good and bad.   In this case however, I felt that even if I had sped up my style of play and succeeded in building the tombs, I wouldn't have been able to challenge Seth militarily anyway, and this was confirmed in my second playthough.  I want to qualify this review by saying I enjoyed the game and would recommend it.   In reaction to the developer: I do not think a special mode needs to be created to make the game 'much easier'. I'd suggest within the current easy mode, just reduce scouting times, and reduce the size of a few of the enemy armies (or make building armies faster/easier... for instance instead of +6 soldiers on a site, make it +12, or whatever).",

            "review_text": "I guess you are reading all those reviews to see if this game is worth buying? Well, lets cut it throught, it is absolutly worth buying.  The game is actually very accurate on historical facts (for the much we know on the egyptian era). You walk throught the game and you wonder if you can believe and learn from what it gives you, well do not worry, you can totally learn from it.  You play or played games where you wonder what kind of button is this or that and what it does? Well you don't need to puzzle it out now because the gameplay is not needlessly complex but also no too much easy. You would totally drag fun from this one.  The artwork is awesome, seriously, they did a great job with it, and the animations are very beautiful and well articulated. I was quite impressed by that last one.   Anyway, in my opinion, this game is worth its 9.99$, even if not in sale. The developpers are one of the few left that actually care about the game they make, not just release a game half completed and patch it with expensive DLC's. Also, they tend to update the game on players requests.   Ok I'm done bye.",

I sometimes achieve the Chiefdom task and sometimes fail it but still have no idea what the criteria are. Needs more polish and clarity then it would be a good game. As it is, I would recommend it but with reservations.",

The game looks simple but it has a depth for strategy games that makes me feel like a much less micro-managy version of Total War. No need to deal with individual units, let the game play out and bring Egypt into a prosperous setting! Very fun! (And yes, I may only have 2.3 hrs of playtime currently but that will be rising).",

Egypt just multiplies the content, possibilities and activities but still keeps the same formula and fun (if you like this game style).   The price may be a bit higher, would prefer 5 dollar range but not sad paying a bit more.   If you are unsure about this game being your cup of tea, just go and try Marble Age (it's often on sale). Having fun with that game? You definitely should buy this one.   In case I find some problems, playing this game, I will update this opinion.  ",

Multiple levels of difficulty make for high replayability, too. Be warned: the game comes to a very abrupt end -- by design -- in about 3000 BC (something that I find quite refreshing -- some games these days can drag on far too long!).  I've played it through twice now, and lost both times (the second time by just one turn, curse it!). Each playthrough took me about ten hours, and as I'm sure I'll try it again, I consider this game excellent value for money.",

Potential is here but the game is just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly hard cause random ♥♥♥♥.  This is an updated version of my review. The new patch has made up for a lot of the problems i had with the game. I had two playthroughs and not once did i get more then two negative events in a row. The game is much more enjoyable now.   I have a complaint that i would like an easier way to be able to spot how i can earn bronze/silver/gold ratings on the missions. When you get a mission i would love it you could see what was needed to get those ratings.   Overall its a cool game.",

You make little gif cards for your persons to do thing and they repeat the little animation ove and over with repative monotny. There board is almost exactly the same every time you play it. It is actually easier if you dont play beginner mode but that make very different in the effort. The battles are decided by the computer is a completely uknown fashion and there is nothing you can do to make it come out differently.   Really I thought this was a game up my alley but since you can never get through it with what appears to be any amount of success then it become tedious. There must be a secret sequence like a puzzle to this game but what I wanted was a strategy game not a puzzle.",
