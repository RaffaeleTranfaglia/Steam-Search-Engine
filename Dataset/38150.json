            "review_text": "This is the one we've all waited for folks. The crowning jewel of gaming is here, gloriously adorned upon the heads of a rather overweight and pasty infantile manchild. Farm Frenzy 3 is perhaps the most compelling title to come out for the PC in well over a decade. Gaming has taken us from the arcades, to the living room, and now, to a farm. I don't think it's understating things to say that this game means we, as artists, have truly arrived. The sheer amount of animals, feed, and government subsidies in this game will have you entertained for nearly ten whole hours, which is a lot these days i'm told.   When you're done exploring this games deep messages about the struggles of everyday animals, humans, and Monsanto (whatever they are) You'll also find quality in the games deep economic systems. Now, this is by no means Farm Frenzy Pizza Party, which as i'll discuss in my next review is the most in-depth game since EvE, but this game will have you reaching for your Fischer Price Abacus at least once or twice. It really put a strain on the brain I haven't used in a decade of legitimate 100% objective gaming journalism.   All in all, i'd say that both as a message about the world travels we've gone through as gamers, or a sheep ♥♥♥♥ing simulation, i'd give Farmvill- Farm Frenzy 3 a 7.5/10",
