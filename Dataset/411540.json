            "review_text": "Overall, Hybrid Wars is a decent game for its decent price. If you enjoy mechs, tanks, helos and explosions, this game has it.   Pros: - Pleasant graphics at High settings, nice particle effects for explosions - Fluid combat, relatively easy controls - Mech combat is reminisent of Mech Warrior, one I enjoyed - Skill-Tree progression for Heroes, Vehicles - Heroes have somewhat unique abilities, each with different mechs with different weapons  Cons: - Story is meh, you're a mercenary working for some tech company. Narrator voice acting is mediocre at best, I can't stand his voice.  - A few graphical quirks here and there, could definitely use some polish.  - The vehicles you unlock are constantly available and respawn throughout the maps, making the use of your Hero pointless at times.  - Campaign is kinda short, been playing for a few hours and already 50% complete.    There are many things that could make this game better and increase its replay value, in my humble opinion. As it stands though, its an enjoyable game. Give it a try.",

This is more like something you would put together yourself while messing about with unity. Really surprised  wargaming.net  have associated themselves with this.",
