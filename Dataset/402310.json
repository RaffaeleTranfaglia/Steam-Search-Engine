            "review_text": "This must be one of the greatest games so far this year. With a very unique progression system, good writing and excellent learing curve I just keep coming back. Trying to figure out the best party/skill/weapon setup. The dark souls/FTL crossover (thats not really an accurate description but close enough) and generic turnbased combat really works. The 'noooo... I was so close and my party so powerful - how could I possibly loose?!?!' and the joy of figuring out a really powerful combo are great as well as the tounge in cheek writing.. 'He's become a peyon' as well as trying to remeber which quests lead to riches and which ones to certain doom is really great. Highly recommended.  Now, back to figuring out the clues to unlock my next hero combination!",

            "review_text": "This game is the very definition of a hidden gem among all these 'rogue-like' rpgs. I admit that when I picked it up on sale, I wasn't expecting anything other than a cute but typical fantasy rpg to pass the time, but I was pleasantly surprised. It's a lot of fun, and there are several laugh out loud moments that took me off guard. There is a ton of replay value. If you play this on Normal and stick to it, the game makes you earn each tiny step forward, but it's incredibly rewarding when you do.  There are times when this difficulty can be frustrating, especially on the quests where you can't jump back on your ship and sail away as fast as possible when you only have two people and they're on the verge of death (Here's looking at YOU, you 'I'm a grand master' story that unlocks the amazing Guardian character). It can feel a bit tedious when you redo the same quests over and over, but the game will give you different outcomes and reactions--which is refreshing.  The art style and music is wonderful. You really feel like you're on an adventure when you listen to it. Some of the quests are genuinely touching (the girl who though she was fire. Dem feelz, man) or amusing. This is definitely worth picking up if you're looking for a fresh take on the rpg, turned-based combat game with a fun, simple story.",

            "review_text": "Bought it primarily for the Story Builder feature. There is no helpful documentation in tapping into the complexity that seems to be present. The two PDFs provide a lot of color but no detail in how to actually build stories. Plus there were some really bad spelling mistakes that I found distracting, especially after the lecture in the PDFs about proper writing. I refunded the game but still have it on my Wishlist, hoping to see that the documentation for actually creating stories becomes available. I cannot recommend the game now because of this, but I look forward to purchasing it again when the creation tools are considerably improved.  Edit... I think I was too hasty with my thumbs-down, so I am making a positive change. When the documentation for the Story Builder is available I will purchase once again.  Edit2... repurchased the game. Wished the documentation is there for the Story Builder. I think it has potential but the developers have to be working on improving it. There is so much we can do in Story Builder. The few Youtube videos are outdated by revisions. I wish we could load some of the Workshop creations into the Story Builder. Taking a look at those would help those of us who are stumbling. OverfdrivePedal, looking forward to more documentation. Thanks!",

The only reason I played for as long as I did was because I wanted to TRY to get my money's worth out of it after accidentally playing past the 2-hour mark and not being able to refund it.  The art style is charming and the humor was cute where it could be found. Other than that, this game is just plain unenjoyable.",

Have been trying for 3 days, maybe 10 hours, to unlock Ranger class. There are no instructions, a wiki spreadsheet says must be friends with Hollows, and one character have Rapid Persona, then trigger on a Grassland isle. Have started over a dozen games where I just built up Hollows to Friend, then with difficulty get Rapid, then visit Grassland isles. Have visited over 30 Grassland isles with conditions met, Ranger has never triggered. So either the spreadsheet is wrong or this game sucks even more than I thought. Rapid persona keeps getting overwritten by junk personas, I have to look for an Inn. Random encounters surprise with way OP Everguards or Vorm, and no option to leave, just team dies and start over. Regret buying this game at Steam sale.",
