            "review_text": "Do not purchase the game! I just requested a refund for this game, since it has so many flaws. The Controls ar akward, combat is dull, level design is bad. And besides - there are even worse problems - the game keeps crashing after solving puzzles. You end up with a black screen every time you close your inventory and there are even some spots, where the game mechanic prevents you (!) from clearing the room.  The game has, on the other hand, charming optics and a beautiful soundtrack, I definitly admit that. But the game itself is so poorly executed, it feels like a pre-pre-alpha version. And so I have to verdict, that purchasing this game is a fraud! Save your money as I trying to get a refund from Steam right now.",

            "review_text": "To sum up my feelings for this game, it's just not that fun. Everything seems sub-par. The combat, the platforming, the puzzles. The intro's tutorial asks 'do you know how to walk?' and 'do you know how to shatter?' But it does not tell you, so I had to quit back to the main menu to enter the customize controls screen to figure out how to shatter.  This is a game that is in dire need of some hand-holding for the first parts of the game to direct players what to do next and how to do it, and then after that take off the training wheels and let them use this new-found knowledge and apply it themselves.  I'm not much for puzzle platformers to begin with so my review may be a tad bias. But I love the Trine series and found that series to be one of the most beautiful series in the genre to date, and loved every minute of those games. This was just a very stale experience overall and I'm a bit disappointed. I'm going to try and press on further to see if things get better, and if my opinion changes I will change my review accordingly, but as of right now first impressions aren't very good.",
