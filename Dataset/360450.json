            "review_text": "This is a very interesting and pretty little game with a simple premise. Samurai swordfights, 1 on 1, first hit wins. Its good at what it is, the problem with the game is that its very one dimensional. There is a bit of depth to technique as you get deeper into the game, but the game's lack of content hurts it from being something you will put a lot of time into.  Recommended on the cheap or if in a bundle.",

Fights are extremely satisfying as the controls are responsive. When you come out best you feel you've really achieved your victory (not just mashed some buttons) due to a solidly conceived and executed combat system. Great art design to. ",

            "review_text": "Excellent little fighting game.   Hotseat duels are the best part of game, with graphics and music. Challenges are fun, but done in 15 minutes and while computer offers some challenge, it gets old quite fast. Online seems next to impossible to play, as timing is everything in this game and having even 100ms delay is going to make a huge difference here. Even hotseat, it is extremely hard to time counterattack right, seems pretty much not possible over internet.  Next issue is that strike from j√µdan is simply bit too easy and powerful versus other techniques. Game captures the feeling of a sword duel in very nice way. Deflecting blows should maybe work bit better though, it's much easier to parry a sword strike in real life than in this game.  None the less, very entertaining game for a while. The price is just right at around $5. This won't last forever as an entertainment, but has potential to offer quite fun hotseat duels for a while.  With slight strike balancing and a single player sidescrolling adventure this would be very good game. I do not dare to ask decent online experience though, it would kill the spirit of the game too easily if timing was made possible with any lag. Maybe a slider for game speed could come handy for online?",
