If he joins your game, best to leave as they all have hacks and aimbot..  With that said, the actual game is like Black Ops 3, just magnified quite a bit, if you enjoyed BO 3, you'll enjoy IW... ok well actually you won't enjoy it, as the hackers are in about every 1 out of 5 games.. Normally they only grace you with one match, once you threaten to report them, they typically leave immediately... as if most of us are too stupid to know how to go to the friends/Recent player area and report them.  If IW ever decides to clean out, or perminant account ban hackers from every COD game from this point onward, you can continue to find them game after game, match after match.. Then Activision will wonder why their games are selling less and less copies.. Gamers are fed up with nothing being done to stop cheaters..  ",

            "review_text": "This is my first review for a game since conception of my steam account. Although there have been many games that have deserved good, maybe even stellar reviews, this one is negative for the most part. Although its worth noting that my pessimism for PC games ha only grown over the years with the shift in focus that has been catered more towards console gaming.   I think the most depressing thing about this game is the community or lack thereof. The most I saw playing at once on a weekend was around 7,000 players and that number is dwindling because 1 out of 2 games there is hacker there to ruin the fun. Why Infinity Ward hasn't a patch to answer this let alone something to prevent hacking in the first place?   I am going to bed tonight and the rest of the next week dreaming that somehow I get a refund so I can give it to a bum in need. Surely that person would have more fun than I have had wasting my time and frustration on what could of been something good.  I will however say that the feel of the game is worth noting, no mouse input lag and aiming just feels fluid. Gameplay is actually pretty decent. Maps could be a lot better. It feels a lot like Advanced Warfare which I actually liked a lot.  It's also too bad that MW Remastered didn't take off as well as we thought.  Sadly a waste of $80 and I hardly see PC gaming let alone this franchise get any better with the complete neglect of the PC gaming community.",

            "review_text": "This review will only be about the multiplayer; I plan to try zombies and campaign later.   IW MP is basically a worse version of BO3 MP, so I'll be comparing the 2 games often. Minor improvements in some areas, but not nearly enough to save the game.  Pros: - Decent optimization - Marginally better supply drop system where weapon variants are craftable with in-game currency  Cons: - Population is already low (about 7.5k when I checked) - 90 fps cap - Minor bugs in graphics settings - Distorted graphical effects when increasing FOV - Maps and camos don't look as good - Cluttered, claustrophobic maps   BO3 didn't have the best maps, but the ones used in e-sports (Infection, Fringe, Hunted, etc.) were good in my opinion because they were open enough but not too big either. In these types of maps, all kinds of weapons were viable. In IW, all the maps I played were very confusing as there are always multiple lines of sight you have to watch. They didn't really take advantage of the advanced movement either.  - Awful spawns   In TDM, everyone spawns at the same spot. This means that you can't find any enemies for 30 seconds, then suddenly 4 enemies pop up right in front of you at once. Combined with the maps, the core gameplay of IW felt very annoying.  - Boring Rigs   The combat rigs are basically the same thing as specialists in BO3, but with less personality. I didn't like the specialist weapons in BO3, but they were at least fun to use when I was the one using them. In IW, the weapons feel like they're copied and pasted, yet still annoying to die by.   I didn't hate BO3, and I actually spent a lot of time with it, but the TDM-fest bored me at the end of its life cycle. Since IW MP is a less enjoyable version of BO3 MP, I don't think I'll be playing it as much.  Edit: One more thing, the hit markers show up later after conencting your shot compared to past CoDs. Might have something to do with lag comp, but it feels like constantly playing in a 100+ ping server.",

Grabbed myself a beer, doritos and fire away!!!  First thing i noticed was the game doesn't support widescreen in the menu. Is this a deal breaker? No.... but bo3, battlefield etc do support this natively, so it feels and looks a bit odd.  I kept running to the fridge over and over again to grab some more beer because to be honest, the matchmaking and the quality of servers is BROKEN from the start. It takes ages, grew me a beard, to even find a game, not only the first day.....its just hard to get a normal match. It reminded me of Advanced Warfare..... Don't make the same mistake twice...well they did!  When i finialy got in a game:  What hit me in the face are the poor graphics, really....colours are not vibrant, lack of detail, grainy.... This is not what i expected from a Triplle A game. Movement is nice, speedy just what you expect from a fps shooter, but wait! havn't i seen this before? To be honest it's a bit of 'copy, paste' from Bo3 regarding specialties , characters etc. So the gameplay feels the same, however it would have been nice to see this to be taken to a newer level, not just 'oops i did it again'. It brings nothing new to the game itself. I found myself bored very very soon....  To be honest, it bored the hell out of me, that didn't took me hours. ....remember actual gameplay is even less, because i was unable to find a server in the first place.  I was always a fan of Cod, Treyarch did an amzing job on the series in general..but this is where it stops. There is no WOW factor at all, like i did have with Bo3 ( which still is an amazing game). When you play Battlefield for the first time it's cutting edge! Playing those both and coming to this ther's only one conclusion....  This just seems like a poor Copy Paste Game with no soul of it's own...  Bin there, done that (years ago)  i just hope the refund goes way faster then the matchmaking does......  ",

This is even more prevalent in MWR where looking towards the middle of the map on bog causes my frames to dip to 30 and below, even on the lowest of settings and FOV, with the latest 16.11.2 drivers installed.  On a side note; I personally believe this campaign is the best call of duty campaign SO FAR since Call of Duty 4.  EDIT EDIT: I've managed to improve performance by disabling the drivers I installed to make a ps3 controller work on pc, as well as lowering the polling rate of my mouse from 1000hz to 125, making aim much more consistent and allowing me to maintain a smooth 90fps on infinite warfare at least.",

            "review_text": "This game received a lot of hate the moment it was announced. Sadly a lot of it was cause people wanted to be apart of the club so jumped into the hate wagon. It is indeed funny seeing the same person say it's going to be garbage and then here come November 4th, they're playing...    Campaign   The campaign was a very amazing and was the best I've played in a long time. It gives a future feel but it feels real...for example, if our would was in the future, this is would it would feel like. Where as in Black Ops 3, it was all future based but it felt un-real. The story behind it all was just put together very well. You can tell the Modern Warfare story writers were behind it, haven't seen a good story since MW3.     Graphics   The game also received a lot of hate due to it's graphics. Sure, they aren't as great as Battlefield but it is still very enjoyable. With the right tweaks, you can make it look beautiful.     Multiplayer   When I first played IW's Multiplayer, I honestly hated it. The whole time I was comparing it to Black Ops 3 but after I got this through my head, 'Infinite Warfare isn't meant to be Black Ops 3, if it was all CoDs would be even more of the same'. After that, I was like 'okay, fine I'll keep with it'. Sure enough, after a few hours of gameplay I am starting to enjoy it. It defiantly takes time to switch over, but once you do it is a lot of fun.    Movement System   In my own opinion, the best way to describe it is a mix between Black Ops 3, Advanced Warfare and a touch of Modern Warfare 2. The sliding is pretty cool, jumping feels pretty light and diligent.     Zombies   Zombies is exactly how I predicted. Not as cool as Treyarch's zombies. Which I have to admit, TA has it mastered. But IW's zombies is still fun but it just feels kind of dumb. I was never expecting much of it to begin with, but my opinion could change with newer zombie maps to come.    Performance   I have had no issues what so ever. I'm running on a i7-6700K, MSI 1070, and 16GB RAM. Granted, those are wicked specs but I even tested on a Lenovo laptop with i7-4710HQ @ 2.5GHz / GTX 860M / 8GB RAM and it runs flawless on medium-high settings...50-60fps. So people who say it's optimized bad are most likely wrong and their issues have something to do with their computer. Now I am not saying it's all of their fault, cause there are some issues that Activision needs to fix such as some mouse lag, crashes, freezes, etc. But in my very own honest opinion...something on their computer is causing the issue.    Modern Warfare Remaster   To sum it up it is exactly the same as CoD4 but with newer graphics. Still a great game to play the 100th time, so for sure grab it if you're going to purchase Infinite Warfare. So if you loved CoD4, you'll love this even more.   With all of that said, the Infinite Warfare Campaign is incredible, Multiplayer is good but give it time to sink in, and zombies is fun but also lame. I still recommend it but keep in mind there are some issues that have to be fixed, if you're nervous perhaps wait to December for it to be patched up and working better for some people. Also don’t believe all of the reviews, most of them are based off of someone’s 30 minute gameplay.",

If this game was released under an entirely different title and name, maybe we wouldn't be so disappointed, but it all just boils down to overused concepts and ignorance from the devs about the player base.

It's saddenning to think that the companies consider the player base as a resource for income rather than a source of information to create a better game crafted for a better more innovative gameplay experience. I've hit 3 hours on the game, so it may be too late for a refund, but I'm hoping my request goes through.

Here's a few.   -Constant FPS stuttering and freezing on both games.  -Had to reset my router to get rid of my moderate NAT type -Using a controller can mess the menu's on both games.  -Some maps on the COD 4 remaster just do not load. Either endlessly connects or crashes.  -The load times for the maps that do load are comically long.   (Besides some frame drops and stuttering, Infinite Warfare runs decently. Modern Warfare remastered is just a complete mess for me however. Massive load times, crashing, and constant stuttering have completely ruined it for me.)   In addition to all this, the community for both games are already dead. Only Gamemodes you can play are TDM, Domination and occasionally Search and Destroy. Number of players on release are far below that of Black Ops 3. Also, as if microtransactions in a 60 dollar game with a 50 dollar season pass weren't enough, the supply drop system is now blatantly pay-to-win. You can pay to get gun upgrades that are significantly better then the base weapons. The keys that you get after each match drop at an insultingly slow rate, so people who don't pay are at a disadvantage.   Besides that, I have been enjoying the campaign. From what I have played so far I'd call it the best in years. Multiplayer is similar to Black Ops 3 but worse in most ways. For some bizzare reason, at the moment there are no leaderboards or stats in the game. COD 4 is great of course, when it's actually working. But the tech issues and the above issues are enough that I'd recommend against buying this one.   Edit - 11/14/16 - Just want to say Infinite Warfares campagin was the best they have made in years, probaby since MW2. It's far from perfect, but for the first time since the in 5-6 years they managed to put in some characters worth giving a damn about. Reyes, Ethan, Salt and Omar are all awesome and well written. They even managed to make some decent, memorable levels and setpieces. I'd rate it an 8/10. If you are buying this for campaign, then i'd recommend it. Otherwise, a garbage downgraded multiplayer, and a tech-issue riddled Modern Warfare remastered forces me to still give it a thumbs down.",

I always love cod multiplayer and this the main reason I buy. The game multiplayer here doesnt seem to really well optimize for pc or at least in my opinion. I been get a lot of lack despite the fact that bf1, overwatch, and titanfall2 are doing just fine. I read many of the review online and I need to say those are understated. The multplayer just doesnt felt smooth for this kind of fast pace game its is aiming to be. There are also many of the balance issue here. Im not sure if this experience with anyone but it seem like the submachine gun are completely dominated the game. I mean literally dominated to the point where I think it very op. Shotgun and pistol is doing fine. The assualt rife is out of it place and sniper rifle player seem rarely compare with previous cod. In comparison with BO3, the gamplay here is weird and awkward. The map doesnt suited for free-running. The game also have to many weird gadget that are annoying. Still, the game is playable and enjoyable if you not care about minor detail but It is simply annoying when play if you care.  Conclusion: Campaign awesome &amp; Multiplayer disappoint   PS.

Multiplayer could be fun, if it wasn't for cheaters in both Modern Warfare Remastered and Infinite Warfare. As a Call of Duty fan, I have to say that I don't think that I will ever buy a newly released PC version of CoD again. If I ever by another newly released Call of Duty game, it will be on console. At least on consoles, it is harder for someone to get access to cheating tools. Another benefit that console players have is that at least you can compete in CWL (Call of Duty World League) Sanctioned events. PC players don't qualify for the competition and that sucks. It pains me to say that I would rather get CoD on a console, because my first competitive first person shooter experience was born on the PC. I love the way I can snap onto an enemy using the good old mouse and keyboard. Even though I will be playing CoD on consoles from now on, I can still come back and play some counter strike and team fortress 2.   As far as the quality of the game and the replayability, it is the same old Call of Duty with some changed mechanics to how multiplayer feels. The core gameplay is the same, but the paint is different. The movement systems feels a bit like you are wearing weights on your feet. I think they did that on purpose because people keep using the phrase 'boots on the ground.' I like this game, but please, for the love of God, do not buy another game from these people for the PC. Go out and buy an Xbox One or a Playstation 4 if you really, truly want to keep playing this game. The population of users on the PC is pathetic. And that really sucks, since Modern Warfare Remastered has been awesome. However, they did add supply drops to Modern Warfare Remastered. That does suck, but for the people that really get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off about that, I advise you to find another game to play. There is a new WWII shooter called 'Days of War' coming out soon. Check out the trailers on youtube. It is possible that 'Days of War' will be my Modern Warfare Remastered replacement.    OVERALL VERDICT: It's fun if you like Call of Duty. It's not fun if you don't like Call of Duty. Please don't waste your money on the PC version of the game. Just please don't. You will regret it if you do. Guaranteed.",

Good luck finding a match, because they're rarer than a solar eclipse. I can boot up Black Ops III, find a match and within ten seconds, I'll be gleefully sprinting around the map at a bajillion kilometres per hour, shooting people in the face with my pump action shotgun. Yes, I'm that guy. Sorry.   Then there's the levels. They're too large for 6v6. If I wanted to spend that much time running around a map aimlessly, I would've bought Battlefiel- Oh wait, I did. Whoops. Anyway. For the type of game it is, the maps are just a little too large, and worst of all, they're hardly as varied as they were in Blops 3, with its reasonable range of themes and color pallettes.   What really grates on me about IW is the complete and utter downgrade in atmosphere in this game. You're basically shooting ♥♥♥♥ in space. This isn't Call of Duty. Blops 3 was pushing it with the sci-fi, but its semi-industrial, near-future aesthetic kept it fresh, familiar and a complete pleasure to look at. This, however is a leap too far. If I wanted to blow things up on Mars, or weird, unfamiliar planets I'm pretty sure I'd just play Doom. Or Halo. Or Destiny. Or any of the other bajillion intergalactic sci-fi shooters of the past five or so years.   If there's any lesson to be learnt from this, its that Infinity Ward just can't be trusted to make a decent CoD game nowadays. Treyarch need to take the reigns of this franchise and push out titles solely by themselves. It can't be any coincidence that my most fond memories of CoD stem from playing the Black Ops series.  In summary - Do you like bland, generic, Mass Effect style sci-fi? Space shoot outs with laser guns that sound like they're from the old Star Wars films? Horribly broken match-making and a shockingly low playerbase? WELL THEN. Pick up a copy of IW today!",

So far, the campaign is ok, but I feel it lacks some of the gravitas that the early modern warfare's had. The Sci-fi setting is ok, but the biggest thing it does for you in ground combat is give you sci-fi guns that fire energy rounds and lack some of the 'oomph' of the regular weapons.   Flight missions are a decent change of pace, and the 3D combat is interesting, but amplifies any issues that might arise when you're taking damage but aren't exactly sure where it's coming from.   Biggest issue so far is a game-breaking bug in one of the Titan missions that stops the game from progressing after taking-off to orbit near the end of the mission. The game leaves you hanging and the mission won't progress. Checkpoint revert is less than a minute before this point and doesn't fix the issue.   As of now, there's no way I can reccomend the game, especially at full price. I would certainly wait until the mission is patched before considering a purchase, but overall, if you're purely interested in the solo campaign, I would reccomend Titanfall 2 over this. The campaign is shorter but the characters are better and the story moves along more without getting caught up in more repetative battles.",

The engines of the two games are so similar that it is obvious that they didn't bother optimizing the game at all. Treyarch, on the other hand, improves their engine with every new game they make.  Tried the multiplayer twice. Lots of spawn kills and more equipment to spend the first 100 hours learning how to use and as usual, Inifnity Ward goes way overboard with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t gear that allows you to *see the other players without a UAV*. The entire setup of this game is just as bad as IW's previous installments, which again goes back to my point of lacking any actual advancement in the game's core functionality. The multiplayer is still an absolute pile of ♥♥♥♥ and that will never change for IW.  Zombies was an absolute joke. Think of how dissapointed true fans were with extinction and then just add zombies. A lot was copied from Treyarch, which is evident from the moment you see the 'Zombies' option on your main menu all the way to the addition of a Fire Sale power up in this game. The voice acting and opening cutscenes? Super cringey. Not to mention that this new 'demon antagonist' has the same actor as Ivor from Minecraft Story Mode. It really just shows how low their budget was in comparison to the expectations that were *supposed* to be met.  All in all, the game is just a copy of Ghosts with the same horrid multiplayer experience (the only way to win is with the most try-hardiest of class setups), dried up zombies to mooch off of Treyarch's idea, and a Campaign that simply lacks any actual change in the terms of plot; the protagonists have their backs against the wall, outnumbered against the enemy... Nothing we haven't had before with the number of games in the series.  My reconmendation is to stick with Treyarch and the masterpiece MP in Black Ops 3. The mod API lets you do pretty much whatever you want. Don't even wait to see if IW makes any positive changes, just keep this abomination off your wish list. It's not even worth getting for just to play the Remaster.",

            "review_text": "NOTE: This is a MW:R review. I just a few minutes ago went into IW to change around some video settings for when I play it later but all today and part of yesterday I spent time with Modern Warfare Remasterd (a little of multiplayer but I did an entire run-through of Single Player). At a later date I'll update this review with an impression of Infinite Warfare.   Alright, so, if you own Modern Warfare on any platform, do not buy this bundle. You have no reason at all to buy this bundle unless you have $80-$100 to literally throw out the window. Until it's sold as a separate title, do not buy this bundle if your main focus is the remaster.   The Remaster isn't a bad game by any means. It's actually a ginormous improvement visually over the original. A lot of the gameplay quirks are still there since it's still the same core of the IW3 engine, but visually it looks absolutely divine. On top of the visuals, the multiplayer feels very akin to the revamping of Halo 2's multiplayer. The only down-side being that you do not have access to the original game and it's multiplayer as you do in the Master Chief collection. The multiplayer is sound, fun and exciting. Though it is still the same basic formula from the original. It's a good love letter to the original delivered in an incredibly oversized box. The oversized box containing itself, squished in with a new, (honestly less anticipated) title and slapped with an $80 price tag.  Though there is a significant issue in Single-Player with the lack of the ability to change your FOV. You cannot change it in your configuration file because the game overwrites it once a level is loaded and you can't change it in your save file because the game recognizes a bad checksum when you attempt to load the save. Incredibly frustrating to play through the entire campaign at 65 degree field of view.  MW:R itself is honestly worth a $25-$30 max price tag. So in a way, if you find you do seriously need Infinite Warfare and you just happen to want this title, then the Digital Legacy is actually quite a steal for you. But for the majority of us excited with the idea of having a remastered COD4 and less excited by a Call of Duty space adventure, $80 is a no go.  (Will be inserting my IW review here)  Again, to clarify, MW:R is not a bad remaster at all. Honestly I believe it's right up there with The Master Chief Collection (it's online daubles aside) in terms of care and focus on the title. The only downside being the original is not included with the reaster so that we have access to both games' multiplayer (because who doesn't love a 48 player FFA on Bog?). Aside from that, the campaign is the same exact campaign as we remember it with amazing visual retouching and the multiplayer is sound and lightly retouched with all of its original appetizing elements remaining intact. I'll consider this a reccomended title IFF (if and only if) IW is actually a title worth buying on it's own. We are supposed to review IW and not MW:R anyway right? So what sense does it make to reccomend a package deal based on the smaller item in the package that doesn't even have it's own offering?",

I bought the game and decided to try it out: the campaign was simply brilliant! The characters were well-rounded and delved into. The only flaw was that this campaign felt too short. The multiplayer is not my type of multi, a bit too futuristic with the wall running and the overdrive and futuristic weapons. However, there is the UMP 45 and the P90 and M4(under different names). I'm not a huge fan of zombies, but as far as those go, this edition was pretty darn good. The gameplay is great, just like the graphics. To me, games are only as good as their stories, and this one is heartfelt and deep. A great mix of action, responsibility, and emotion in this game. 8/10 for me.

            "review_text": "Read the review of a hardcore and experienced COD fan :)  Ok guys, to start with...I owned every COD game and played all of them online after black ops, got 3000+ hours online. I love the franchise, it's the only multiplayer game I play online and I was really looking forward for this one BUT unfortunately, really hated this COD. I hated it at first so I have decided to play more till I like it. It has been 50 hours now and nothing new, I still hate it... So here's why;  First of all and probably the most important one is that, the multiplayer part is broken! I don't know if it's the lag compensation or the code but it's definitely not working out. If you're lagging or have a bad connection, then you have no chance against a good player with a good connection. Most of the time, I see the player and shoot but die instantly!!! So, I watch the killcam and see that I don't even fire before he put 3 bullets in me??? :) I'm a good(!) player. I had around 2-3 kd in the previous games so I'm definitely no noob and know what I'm doing and telling you that, this one is broken for sure. And I don't have a bad connection BUT I live in Turkey so my ping is always a bit higher than the players in europe, so in this game it just destroyed the whole experience...this one is the first and only COD that I had problems with connection, lag and lag compensation...whatever you wanna call it!  And... In bo3, you were able to see people's steam accounts so you can look whether they have VAC bans and such... This time, nothing! You were able to see your opponents kd's, individual kd's with different game modes, with different guns and so on which was great actually...This time, it's gone as well!?!? In bo3, you were able to see your ping, this time just some stupid bars which doesnt work at all! The menu part also feels a bit dated so with this game, it's like COD has gone 10 year backwards?!? Good job treyarch! Keep up the good work...  I'm not even gonna start with guns. It's highly unbalanced and smgs dominate. The hipfire with laser sight is also op which turns this game into rushing around, hipfiring all the way... Terrible...  The only think I like about this game is the new 'missions' part. Which is a nice addition. You can also get all the guns with working hard online. So it's not all luck like the bo3. Other than that, bo3 dominates this game in every aspect. Hell, advanced warfare was 10 times better than this!!!!  Shame on you COD for ruining smt that we've waited for 2 years since AW...Shame on you!!!",

This is below that at the moment.   The campaign is pretty boring, you spend more time talking, walking and opening doors, than actually fighting. (Why do I have to open every single door myself if i'm the highest ranking officer?)   Multiplayer stutters constantly, despite running at 60 fps constantly. Not to mention the horrendous maps and hit detection. Modern Warfare Remastered is even worse, it stutters so much the game is totally unplayable, despite running at 70-80 fps.   Zombies is this games sole redeemer. The New zombies is a great fresh take on the zombies game mode, with a great 'art' style and level design. The hit connection is solid and the weapons have a punch to them.   Overall, this game is ok but could be so much better if the game didnt stutter all the time.   I suggest waiting till a few of the patches come out to fix the performance issues before you buy this, unless all you care about is zombies.   ",

They take your cash and toss you a broken piece of software which is badly made and has some of the worst netcode I've ever seen. When there's no cheaters around, the host is king of the game. within the same lobby, I've varried from 0.1 K/D to 20 K/D and I've seen others do the same. It's all up to the lag, here.   Microtransactions with RNG. So, The loot crates are back and contain a lot of lootcrate exclusive variants. The scrap system gives you SO little scrap that it's practically unviable to use and the key system remains the same as in BO3. In short, a tasteless cashgrab, were it not that these variants do give you a real advantage. For example no damage drop-off at range, extra extended mags, etc.    All-in-all, it's a shame really. The futuristic theme may not appeal to everyone, but mechanically the game is allright. The lack of PC support and anti-cheat have ruined what would have been a somewhat generic but still very enjoyable CoD.   Would not recommend buying it until all of the above is fixed, if ever.   ",

Half way (or what is half way of seemingly eternity) I just wanted to switch sides really. The plot is absolutely mental.

You need to write him a reason to be so angst towards the earth people. The motives are all lost in this mess of a plot. It's just ♥♥♥♥ed.  Also don't try the multi-player. Really... I've played multi-player shooters and can handle a mouse 4/5, but after getting over level 5 at this point of the life cycle of the game, you end up matching with prestige-up-the-♥♥♥-level-who-knows-how-many, and you will find yourself trying to find cover time after time when you re spawn... never really getting to it.

Whether its aggressive aim assist even when turned off or auto flight when locked on in air combat, this game seems to find new ways to be that friend who says 'I'll just help you get passed this bit'.  The graphics and performance is all over the place too; certain textures are just low res garbage that is mixed in with amazing ones, the game decides it needs to load mid level on my 970 despite running at a mostly smooth 60fps. I have also run into a weird 'VAC' error that apparently was happening in Ghosts but is still happening and it stops you from entering in MP without a restart.   In summary the Single Player is pretty much press x to win, and the multiplayer is the worst fps mp i have played this year.

Now I will start off by saying this: do not purchase this game if you played other titles before Black Ops 2. You'll get very frustrated by the speed of the game, and will find yourself lost and confused. Just wait until Modern Warfare Remastered is released as a standalone title and play that.   This is the first ultra-futuristic title that I have seen that doesn't include aliens, a welcoming change to the FPS genre, though the game does heavily feel like that I'm playing Halo 5. The MOBA style specialists from BO3 is here, in the form of rigs. These rigs don't vary much in terms of design, and don't have any personality, designed to look as though they're ruthless killing machines. Although I do enjoy the mixup of payload weapons and abilities that they have, which mixes perfectly with the trait system.  The weapons, are a direct mixup between balistic and energy weapons. Some classic weapons have been thrown in as well, including my favourite the M1. Some of these weapons handle the same, offering little difference between them. After a while of using the same weapon, you'll notice the differences, however they are very suttle. All your typical lethals and tacticals are here too, with a couple of new varieties. Majority of the time, I don't find myself using these at all due to the speed of the game.   The camo system is of something to be of a serious challenge. Your typical primary weapon will exhibit 200 kills, then 160 headshots (yeah, worse than AW), then specific challenges. Though as you complete a certain number of headshots, you'll unlock the ability to unlock another task specific camo. I find the 160 headshots to be rather tedious, but hardcore makes this challenge somewhat easier.  Overall, it's a decent FPS with room for improvement. I have barely touched Zombies mode or the Campaign, but will update if need to be.  - Jockman",

The movement system has been refined from AW and BO3 and it's the best yet; strafe sliding? Yep, about time. COD is all about the gunplay and while this year's game has less than usual, the prototypes make up for this and then some.  Player numbers are currently pretty low for a COD title (BO3 has more players, but it has amazing mod tools to be fair) however if you're in Europe you'll have no issues getting a game, if you like TDM which most of the player base appears to.

Zombies: Atleast the zombies they did pretty ♥♥♥♥kking Gud in for there first time at the gamemode, and it seems like they actually put some time and effort into it unlike G@yarchs lazy a$$ (Plus theres David Hasselhoff).  7 Reasons why most people hate COD: Infinite Welfare.  1. No Kevin spacey.  2. No Eminem Rap Cover like other iw made cod (Even ghosts had one lmao).  3. No new dog models (No Doggo period).  4. No dank Drill Sergeant or Snoop Dog pack  5. This Beta is makes friends become enemies bc when on the steam store page for this Beta and you see one of your autistic friends 'wants this game' you have to kill them/ unfriend them (Im looking at you The Real Dank Meme)  6. This sad excuse for an Alpha costs more than Skyrim SE like WTF!?!??!?!  7. All the females in this Tech-Demo are flat as a Home Depot Card board  -1088/420 Mountain Dew Doritos  -Angry Joe    ",

All in all the game is great i mostly enjoyed the campaign.",

The rigs are not good ..the weapons are ♥♥♥♥ and as explained by driftor the recoil on guns is poor and varies heavily...the foregrip has almost no significance on guns ...

But if you look at Infinite Warfare alone it certainly deserved a warmer welcome then it got.  Campaign is very solid: the story is engaging, it has a fairly resonable foundation, level design and gameplay were well made and overall I've got a lot of pleasure going thought single player campaign. Sadly it has little to no replayability to it, but still it felt far from what other COD games have to offer in terms of single player experience. As for multiplayer the only complaint I have is the poor selection of mp maps, and well, playerbase is far from huge. Still got some fun out of it.  On the technical side of things as of now, two month after release the game runs fine enough, without noticeable performance issues and only once I've stumbled across a bug in story mode.",

It's basically a horrible ♥♥♥♥♥torm when playing against noobs. For one, it doesn't work, and secondly, it works even worse than you're currently imagining.  Do you want mouse smoothing on by default? Hey it's got that. Do you want to have to set launch options just to turn it off? Cool.  Do you want a game, where when you change the fov, it adjust to your mouse sensitivty too? Well its got that.  Do you like to type text out in the lobby to other players while you wait for the next map to load? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad, you can't.  Do like it when games are aware that certain items are still locked, so it doesn't add those locked items to challenges after prestiging? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad, the devs don't give a ♥♥♥♥.  If you like playing with turds floating around in the toilet, I highly recommend this game, because it is exactly what you are looking for.  Would you want a scoreboard to track how good players are in your current lobby, or in the MP mode you're in? You know, like Black Ops 3 has? Too ♥♥♥♥ing bad, there is no universal scoreboard.  Do you want tiny ♥♥♥♥ing icons when you presitge that look worse than the original 55 levels of your player, hey the devs made them for you.

Didnt seem to balance well, like OP3, for me the best MP (Next to BF1, the most complete MP Game)  However..... the tide has changed a bit on my stance.  The single player.... i think this is the best FPS (and i liked BF1) so far, been the best ive played in some time for the COD SPS (single player story).  The graphics are outstanding, the story line gripping! Ive put in a few hours and honestly loved it so far and hardly dented it.  Why they didnt just release the Modern Warfare game by itself, seems crazy.... bullied to buy a game that some dont want, which is why i think we are seeing so much negative feedback.  Without doubt, this game fails to be a complete perfect package, its like Pamela Andersons best features with a Honey G looks. BUT it doesnt fail outright. There is some savior....  If you are prepaired to play the game from a single player aspect, id recommend it.  From a MP? Forget it.   One last thing, was i havent mentioned Zombies.... they have smashed with this. really well thought out, very differnt feel and the nostaligic 80s elements (style, In house Games, Music (O THE MUSIC!!) is very fun.

It is very difficult for me to ads as the movement look I need is about 2x the ads speed I need.   I've been playing with the settings and turned off raw mouse settings and it has helped a bit but I think I can aim better with a control pad than my gaming mouse and I'm terrible with a control pad in FPS games.   I have been finding lobbies fill up fairly quickly but the PC is much slower to find players than my Xbox One. I usually buy the CoD games for both PC and console to compare and contrast. I think I prefer the console version this year which is fairly unusual as I game with a 1080 gtx and a 2k monitor. So if you have the choice I would recommend the console version  Finaly verdict - Not a bad game but Titan Fall 2 is simply better in almost every aspect. I can't understand why all these maps are so small. I really hope that future patches and maps can help make this game better.

Cinematics are great, multiplayer is addictive and fun, I played for 14 hours straight without losing 1 percent interest, whereas I couldn't play black ops 3 for more than an hour before getting bored. Zombies is very good, the maps are HUGE, we cannot comment on the storyline yet, but the game looks really good. I give it a 95/100. I take most of my friends agree with me. Even the party system is much much better. This game is tremendously fun, and I don't recommend giving up on it by other people's reviews, because it is very fun! It has an oldschool CoD feeling, because it isn't just point, click, shoot anymore, it is more challenging than black ops 3, and I see that many of you will get this game for MWR, but play this more.",

            "review_text": "Just a little bit of background info about how I felt about the other Cod games. 1 - Liked 2 - Liked 3 - Disliked MW - Liked, never got into the multiplayer on it WAW - Disliked MW2 - Loved and favourite singleplayer and co-op BO - Loved all modes MW3 - Disliked BO2 - Probably my favourite multiplayer one and zombies Ghosts - Garbage AW - Garbage BO3 - Really liked the mulitplayer, rest was ok.  I bought this (at a massive discount btw) based solely on my enjoyable experience with the BO3 multiplayer and it has been a very so-so experience so far.  SINGLEPLAYER -  It's just simply rubbish, it's the exact same game that is released every year. They have tried to add this sort of Mass Effect 2 mechanic (Cheeky sods even have similar background music) but the problem is the gameplay has not changed at all. I started on the hardest dificulty and after cheaply dying a few times I figured I'd knock it down a few notches and just swiftly play through the game on regular, let me just tell you this game is an absolute joke, you can simply run past entire groups of enemies and your 2-3 man squad will catch up and wipe them all out meaning you don't even have to really do anything. You get to a point where you choose what missions you want to do and I choose a stealth one which was hilariously bad, I had a massive pile of enemies on this second floor area, other guards saw them and did nothing. The other thing is you are fighting a lot of robots which I'm just not into that.  ZOMBIES -  The first game brought a smile to my face, loads of 80s music playing and references which I love and I thought it was a new sort of zombie mode. It's not, it's the same reskinned zombie game from the past few years, it's the same tired gameplay mechanics as all the others, yes the area is big and has some quite nice surprises (Roller coaster target practice + new mechanic for reviving which is really nice!) but your character for example cant really jump or climb over objects which is just horrible. They should make a really fluid movement zombie mode.  MULTIPLAYER -  This is the exact same multiplayer as BO3 with new maps. It's fast paced running, jumping and gunning mayhem. Team play actually means every man for himself, there are no tactcs or team work just kill kill kill and F everyone else in the game. It's just mindless fun, you pick it up for 10 mins have a game and thats it. I've been really loving the BF1 Operations gamemode, I think it's one of the best gamemodes I've ever played before but the problem is it easily takes 40 mins for a game, I had one last 2 hours before. The maps themselves are hit and miss, some set in space are bland foundry types, some set on Earth are a lot of fun and then there is this small one (not sure of the name) which is just insanity, you literally spawn infront of enemies as there is just no space on the map,   Do I recomend this game? If you like COD mulitplayer then yes you will like this one, to everyone else wait for a sale or free weekend.  Oh just to add I'm running on a 6700K and 1070 and can run it in 4K ultra no problems.

            "review_text": "  Take a moment and read this. THIS GAME IS FANTASTIC. Review based on Campaign and Multiplayer.  People are complaining about the loot drops, how its pay to win. Please show me where you can even purchase a loot drop. They dont exist. Only things I have seen for sale is the season pass. I'm sure there will likely be some type of packages for purchase at some point. For now, you can get every weapon with keys earned in game. Its NOT PAY TO WIN OR PAY TO PLAY ANYWHERE. Its just play the game, earn the points and trade for drops. At some point I'm sure there will be microtransactions, but right now, there isn't, everyone complaining about it, they are complaining about something that isnt even there. People are putting out a lot of bad info.  As for the game, the campaign is great, I love sci-fi and this has been a healthy dose of it. Its well written, the dialogue is good, not the typical cheese thrown into fps games as filler. I'm about half way through the campaign and there have been plenty of Holy Crap moments. I havent enjoyed a COD campaign this much since the first Modern Warfare. The campaign has been a pleasant surprise as it is much better than I had hoped. Now for the multiplayer, performance and graphics.  This game has it all, this is by far the fastest FPS game ever made. There isnt a single FPS that can compare to the speed of the multiplayer here, the only one that is close is Quake 3. I play HC deathmatch for the most part, so you only need a couple of hits on each player to move onto the next, this keeps the gameplay frantic. When you learn how deep the movement system really is, you will be blown away, its fast, VERY VERY FAST. You can play some maps without ever touching the floor, or you can play every map without ever getting off the ground. The weapon builds along with the perks and the rig classes allow for a HUGE amount of customization of gameplay styles. There is no overpowering meta build that everyone will focus on, you can build any type of combination into a powerhouse. , the map design is on par with the original MW maps. They just feel great, from the lanes of travel, to spots you can set up an ambush, or you can snipe from a good spot if you find one. The freedom of movement here is unmatched by any other games. It takes a little practice to master, but once you have it, it becomes second nature and sometimes you will pull off movement combos and say to yourself, 'did i really just do that?!!?' SMG play is best suited for high speed, high agility game play, sliding by an opponent to tag him when you go by followed by boosting into the air and hopping from left to right walls, passing other players beneath you, then turning and delivering some SMG Fury, it just feels too good. Rifles and heavier weapons are more suited for the larger maps and a little slower play, every bit as lethal as SMG's. Good variation with the perk systems, that allow for really, any combo and game play style.  Then you have rig specific PAYLOAD weapons and skills. I can tell you that EVERY weapon feels good, the weapon effects are impressive, from the particles, to the relfecting bullets and shrapnel. The very first rig's payload weapon 'the Claw' can clear a room in less than a second with a huge field of fire and an insane fire rate. It will leave you giggling. Then the heavier class, you have a heavy weapon that is a nod to Half-lifes Gluon gun. When you unleash the beam of death upon a foe, you get to see them pop, literally, gratuitous popping sound included. Then you have weapon variations, EVERYTHING can be unlocked in game, just by playing. I've already unlocked a few of the Loot drop box exclusive weapons. Without paying for anything loot boxes, There isnt a place to even buy loot boxes, as of yet. So please disregard people saying that you have to buy them. YOU DONT.   How does it perform? It runs great on my system. It booted right up and played with zero problems even before updating to the current nvidia drivers. The audio is certainly on point here. Every gun sounds good, there is no pew pew sounding pee shooters here. Everything is crisp, clear, and has the bass and thump when it needs it. There is a HUGE amount of customization and optimization options in game. Ive seen a lot of people saying they have had problems with frame rates, even on high end equipment. I think the majority of this is their own configs. Sure there are things that will be improved via patches. But there are many things that can be causing this on their end. A big problem people have had with frame rate with games on steam has been caused by the WIN 10 backround services, the xbox services that run by default in the backround has caused many a frame rate dip on many games. Disabling that may improve your fps problems. Also, disabling nvidia share, or shadow play may improve problems as well.   My only one gripe so far is the capped 91fps in multiplayer, the campaign is uncapped, but the multiplayer can go no higher than 91 fps. I'm sure there will be a fix for this shortly. But even 91 fps is pretty nice performance. You wont notice it at all unless you are running a high refresh rate monitor, like a 144hz. I run an i7 5820k, 64g of ram, and a msi 1080. All stock speeds, at 1440p everything maxed, I have a constant 125fps solid in campaign, and a solid 91 fps in multiplayer. I cant reccomend this game enough.  If you are looking for a fresh fps experience, that is fast, and feels great, THIS IS IT.",

This is a multiplayer and zombies review.  Multiplayer Pros-weapons, maps and everything has variety. game is colorful. guns and maps feel great. lots of awesome customizability for create a class and rigs. Rigs are much better than Black Ops 3's specialists with more option and variety. There is always a consistent number of people playing this game throughout the whole day.  Overall the game is great but there are still some cons that are prettty bad but will probably be fixed soon.  Multiplayer Cons-Sensativity slider doesnt have a number and the lowest possible sensativity was to high for me. Bad lag spikes every once in a while. constantly kicked out of a match when it is about to start. There are not a lot of people playing the game but it really isn't effecting me that much.  Zombies Pros-It is very colorful. It has tons of variety. They changed it up from traditional treyarch zombies. They listened to the community about things like PHD Flopper and Banana Colada. Has an easter egg. It is harder than traditional treyarch zombies. Makes you want to replay the map over and over again.  Those are some amazing pros and honestly I can't say the cons are that bad.  Zombies Cons-High round attemps are very hard to stay alive on because it is so much harder than treyarch zombies. The easter egg is there but it isn't much.   The cons for zombies really aren't that bad because it is a great game. Overall throughout the whole game I would say it is amazing game. Sorry I didn't do a singleplayer review but I just havn't played it yet but most people don't buy Call of Duty just to play the singleplayer.  Overall Rating-8.5/10  I would recommend this game to anybody who is a fan of the Call of Duty Franchise.",

It could be optimized a little better, but for the most part.... this is the best COD ported pc game theyve made. Havent played campaign. Multiplayer was rough for awhile, but like any COD game, you will get destroyed until you learn spawns and map. Once i hit lvl 30 MP it gets pretty fun. It doesnt have many bugs surprisingly for it only being out a few weeks. I am big Blops 1 zombies fan.... I can easilly say these zombies are even better. You dont have to be try hard entire time not to die, much easier to go to higher rounds. Easier to unlock PAP, weapon kits are OP, fate and fortune cards are pretty much like gobblegum from Blops3. Overall i woulld say MP 8/10. &lt; Coming from xbox one COD veteran. I have stout PC so PC port matters alot... Like i saidd its really not bad at all.

Still l know some people worked really hard to make this game so l have to respect the fact that it is a FPS and it is a well made game and runs extremely well on my 2 year old Alienware laptop. I must give Activision Kudos for their COD games as they do run really well at high settings on old rigs. Will edit this review once l have completed the game... Have not completed it yet but am a few more hours in...Really great game, l really like the Mass Effect style ship HUB where you can choose the side missions on the map and get upgrades ect. I really like the space combat, just dumb and fun. I know the sci fi genre has been done over and over again but man it just pure fun, Mass Effect, Battle Star Galactic...you name it, any Sci Fi hit you can think of is all in there. The only thing l find is the FOG OF WAR, in real life it is hard to know who is what in a fire fight unless you are in the fantasty of Halo Red vs Blue. In this game it is hard to work out because of the uniforms both sides are wearing are all set in a more grounded universe. Again in real life no Army would wear bright colours to be identified by the enemy. Hopefully l can finish the campain and finish this review. Just finished the campaign...really awesome. The end just ends though and 'John Snow or Kit H' was not what l thought it would be. The only downer is that the game is awesome but it is a 'Buzz Kill' when everyone *spoilers...dies. Most of the Modern space Call of Dutys (Ghosts Advance) do not have sequels. But it would be hard to have a sequel when both sides are all dead! Anyway great game and worth the play through.

I just wish I knew what they talked about in te cutscenes... because as I previously mentioned... they did not bother to optimize that part of the game at all. I espeically like how the campgain is no longer linear, wihtout spoiling too much you can pick which missions you want to do when (besides the main missions).

They are 100% wrong, the game does indeed have a built in Anti-cheat. The game is new, so there are bond to be some cheaters. Infinity ward are currently collecting Intel on the situation and will be doing a big ban wave pretty soon!  The Textures of the game are amazing, but that's not a surprise for them. The maps are totally different to what we have seen on the other generation of cod games. The guns and killstreaks are also pretty cool. They have added in some new killstreaks which I really like.  Overall I love the game &lt;3",

            "review_text": "(Will update when more hours played) I have bought all CODs (and Battlefields), except Black Ops III, and starting from MW2 I have hundreds of hours on each one. We as players were getting angrier and more hopeless with each new release because Activision does not listen to the players. Games were being released, and each time players had their own reason to complain, but in my opinion, this game does not get the credit it deserves. I believe this is the best one yet (based on my own criteria of course).  This game is not even closely related to Battlefield and should attract a different playerbase. The information you can find on the internet about this does not represent the opnion of individuals. It represents the opinion of only a few, and the rest will just agree without having enough experience and arguments.  Pros:  - Call of Duty is finally getting skill based. It's not a spray 'n pray anymore. Explosives are balanced. Grenade launchers as a weapon attachment are not available. Campers usually get punished. Jumping at the right time is advised to evade bullets. Targetting people is hard in this fast paced game. - The progression system is implemented very well in my opinion, and all is done to make you come back every time for more. The amount of personalization is insane. LOTS of weapons. Tons of badges and callcards (MP) and fortune cards (zombies) to unlock. There are also quite alot of SCOREstreaks. These are hard to get and balanced. Custom weapon (with perks) can be unlocked with either boxes, or salvage. You get keys naturally after each game. These keys can be used to open boxes. Each time three items (weapon, callcard etc.) of possibly different rarity will unlock. Most importantly: keys carry over between zombie and multiplayer mode! - The graphics are beautiful. There's not more to say about this. The lighting effects and postprocessing are better than ever before. The game is fairly well optimized, and SLI is supported. - Zombies are tons of fun, but not easy. It will probably require some time before you know the entire maps and all the items and perks. Dying is now not permanent anymore, and as long as another teammate lives you can ress. after a while. by playing arcade games :).  Cons:  - Technical issues that people experience either only happen once or are system-specific. Problems I experienced so far:  Can't use second monitor while playing fullscreen. Some random crashes. - Matchmaking in Zombies is a problem. You have to wait a very long time before being able to play. - The campaign is pretty good, but not great. This ofcourse is my opinion, and experiences with the campign have always been divided. - Modern Wafare remasted is not available as a stanalone purchase. This will probably change in the future. Aside from the amazing graphics and some minor changes in multiplayer not much changes here. Check the store page of this game for the best reviews.  All in all this is a good game, and it will probably be even better after a few patches.",

            "review_text": "Never really played much COD, found the game really enjoyable.  Fast action, stunning sights in the campaign, I've spent a lot more money on a lot worse games...  I'm pretty terrible at it but FPS games usually start that way &amp; make you step up. Used to play a lot of Halo &amp; it's great to see how far games have come. I got this wanting a true FPS, I feel I found one. Hope the campaign isn't as short as people say it is but these days people just put out more DLC.  For me the big pros are,   Shooting out windows in space so the enemies fly out the windows. Grapple hooking enemies then taking off their helmets. Using a gravity grenade to float the bad guys before blowing them apart with a high powered energy weapon. The campaign graphics are solid enough that you're not thinking where's that guys teeth... Attention to detail is astonishing, I like riding the elevator &amp; seeing what people are doing on other floors. Every part of the game has been smooth for me without glitches &amp; I haven't seen any hacks, just salty players.  Let me address some common cons below :P  Seems to be a lot of hate aimed at infinite warfare in other reviews but honestly reading them a lot of the reviews are from people with computers of poor performance or bad internet... multiple people calling wall running hacking for instance... (Learn how to play before posting reviews?) If you have an FPS problem or actions aren't smooth it isn't nessesarily the game.  Can't see any pay to win options sooo... Maybe i'm dumb there but that's been a complaint, also a complaint about levelling up your weapons &amp; such, the more you play the better stuff you get. That's funny as hell because, that's how you get a good player base and actually reward people who like the game.  Reviews also baggin on the COD community, how is that a review on the game son?  Oh with the good gear that you unlock, you can't use it straight away you have to lvl up sufficiently first so yeah a higher level may kick your bum, but go winge at league of legends for not giving you free runes or world of warcraft for not giving you the highest raid gear... Just put the time in if you want to play like every other game.",

            "review_text": "Alright, review time. I'll keep this as short as possible while trying to address a variety of things without skimping on detail (keeping in mind that it's release day I've only sunk a few hours into private matches with a friend so far and am yet to touch campaign, zombies or online play):  GAMEPLAY: It's Call of Duty. If you're new to the franchise, then you'll be in for some finely-tuned first person shooting with customizable classes and advanced movement such as wall-running and double-jumping. If you've played some of the older titles, the best description of how the engine handles would be to say that it's like if 'Ghosts' had 'Black Ops 3''s jetpack. There are a host of new features, as with every installment in the frachise, but for the most part they're overshadowed by the community and the game is just seen as another excuse to get more maps to play in multiplayer and a new campaign to play.  ENGINE: This is one of the finest releases to date. The previous three releases have all been severely problematic for me upon release. Usually I see things like memory leaks, servere connectivity issues or game-breaking glitches the moment I'm in and grow frustrated with the fact I'd pre-ordered for all this trouble. This release is completely different. I wasn't excited this time around - I was wary. I set aside a couple of hours for troubleshooting, fully expecting to have to reconfigure some hardware, reinstall a driver or patch a config file to get the game to run but that wasn't the case at all. My friend and I played together for three hours and the game didn't crash once, didn't have any unexpected errors and run beautifully. If there were any connectivity issues or any lag spikes, we didn't notice (whereas Black Ops 3 is almost unplayable lately because of similar problems).   REQUIREMENTS: I will say the requirements for this game are HIGH. I'd honestly recommend higher than what is suggested on the store page. I'm running a GTX1080 and was at the frame rate cap of 91fps for the entire game at 1440p, with everything on the highest settings. If I flicked it up to 4K, I started to drop into the 75 range. 5K yielded a frame rate in the 40-70 range. My friend was running a GTX750M, and despite turning all the settings down and putting the resolution on the lowest possible setting, he could only get an average of about 30fps. If your card is not in the range between these two, you'll likely have some difficulty making the game playable. Specfically, the 750M was playable - but not pleasant. This isn't a fault with the game though, this is just an advancement in technology that a lot of users in reviews seem to be not understanding, expecting older cards that could play other titles fine to be able to play this title to the same extent.  PROBLEMS: A lot of users are leaving harsh, angry reviews in the review section and without being too harsh towards the community (it's already negative enough as it is), most of the problems are on their side of the field, not the developers. As I've previously mentioned, the game has HIGH requirements. Your top-end gaming PC from three years ago is no longer a top-end gaming PC and a lot of people aren't yet accepting that fact. If you've got a card with less than 4gb of VRAM and have set any of the cache maps to ON, then your game WILL stutter and your textures will look muddy, washed out, and all kinds of terrible. Similarily, if you've got a card that could play DOOM on high settings - there's no guarantee that it can run this game on the same settings. A lot of users are just writing angry, illiterate abuse because their game isn't running on crazy settings when there's no reason it should be. The best bet is to turn everything down and see how it runs and then work your way up. See what kind of impact each option has. Textures, for instance, uses a lot of VRAM and can cause hitching but will have little-to-no effect on your frame rate. Render Resolution, however, will have a lot less of a VRAM impact but will have a severe impact on performance and frame rate. It's why these options are available - for users to be able to cater what they want prioritized and modify their visual experience to match both their expectations and their rig. I don't mean to belittle those with actual problems though, no game is without glitches and my experience is not your experience. Just be wary reading the angry reviews written along the lines of 'GAME IS F***ING ♥♥♥♥ I only got 12fps, I have a GTX960 I should be able to max this'. These people do not know what they're talking about.  FINAL WORDS: This game got a lot of hate before it was released and I completely understand why. I joked with a few friends last year making a comment about how the franchise had moved forward in time from past wars, to modern wars, to the future and said 'What's next? Call of Duty: Space?'. I honestly couldn't believe it when they announced it, my terrible joke was becoming a reality. That being said, this game is best seen as a refinement and a beautiful addition to the series. It takes what Black Ops 3 should have been, and amplifies it. After just a few hours of playing, all my doubts were proven to be worry over nothing. There aren't as many customizations and options as I'd like and some of the maps are pretty bland, but to have an installment in this franchise work so well on release date and to have an engine that has finally found the perfect balance between traditional first person shooting and advanced movement is an absolute blessing.  If you've had any doubts about buying this game, I hope this has cleared something up.",

I have logged over 200 hrs on bo3 and the initial transition to iw is uncomfortable at first. I realized that something was off on iw until I set the POV to 110 which is what I had on bo3. Then the 'feel' is just as good as bo3 if not better. Also iw sets the resolution to 4K supersampling when first launched which makes everything runs slow. I had to set it back to 1080p native than things are A-alright! The MP for is capped at 90-91 and had no problem on my 144hz monitor. I had 50% win-loss records for my first few games and I must say I loved the experience. It was exciting and as fun as when I first on bo3. I am not a long term cod player and I only seriously play cod starting from bo3 so I don't have the burden of nostalgic influence.

Yes its on the rails, predictable and cliched but much like a summer blockbuster film Infinite Warfare posesses enough epic setpieces and adrenaline fuelled action to be a good time.   Multiplayer is broken, but if thats your cup of tea then Titanfall 2 is a far superior 'CoD' like experience for 2016. IW is all about its single player and for that alone its worth a recommend.  - Graphics are competent. Not quite BF1, better than TF2 - Guns are varied and impactful, some interesting variations and 2 in 1's - Voice acting is on point, despite a underwhelming Kit Harrington - Three gameplay loops that are enjoyable when then come around, never feels like they overstay too much  - MP is broken.. - Classes are unbalanced, feels less unique and impactful as their BO3 counterparts - TTK is way too short - Spawns are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ - Overpowered abilities 'Wall hacks' - Miniscule population, especially in OCE.

To me, the game seems fairly optimized, and as such, should be able to run fine on most systems in the last few years. so to all those saying that thier 1080's and 1070's are not getting over 60 fps, they are completely wrong and just posting a bad review because its a cod game.  As far as the gameplay its self, the game seems pretty decent.Sure its a bit different feeling compared to bo3. However, after playing 3 hours so far on my main rig and messing around on the old rig for a few hours, the game is not as slow as i felt it was the first 5 minutes in. The longer you play, the more you feel the speed and overall mechanics tie in well.  The zombies mode, while similar and yet quite different form previous treyarch games, retains most of the core. You have a perk system, points system, powerups, etc. It does have its own feel though and is the main reason getting this game(and also the remaster, more on that in a bit). so far the zombies mode has kept me entertained and will put in more playtime and update the review as i see fit.   Overall, most negative reviews that i have seen are due to cod haters and the fact that the mw1 remaster cannot be bought seperatly at this current time. I really hope that they do the right thing and release the game as a seperate purchase.   Obviously campaign has not been finished in the 3 hours as of writing this, but was played to get my performance numbers. So at this time i will not comment on my thoughts of the campaign but will edit later when i finish.",

            "review_text": "So a lot of the negative reviews don\\t actually cover the topics of the game. Many are either upset that the publisher bundled Modern Warfare Remastered with the game or that the multiplayer communities got split. Others compare it with Battlefield 1, but still, those are not reviews of this game, just popular commentary.  so to start, this is my favorite CoD I have ever played. The controls are tight, movement is great and I genuniely like all the guns enough that I don't have any one favorite. The game has three parts, Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, though this is where the mistakes begin even with the genuine review. The biggest, and most tragic, mistake I have seen from reviewers is that everyone reviews the multiplayer with little to no play time within Campaign or Zombies as nearly all CoD titles in the past have been Multiplayer focused and this one was not advertised, really, any differently. So to put this clearly: THIS IS A SINGLE PLAYER FOCUSED TITLE. If you are coming for the multiplayer, the community is fine, the controls, weapons, game modes and maps are strong. However, this isn't the next innovative multiplayer experience - the multiplayer is fun, but is an add-on to the single player aspects of the game.  The campaign however...the campaign is astounding. Details, gorgeous, real and believeable: Infinite Warfare's campaign is the campaign I've always wanted, but never knew I did. From amazing missions, to a connection with you crew and characters that you grow to love to the gorgeous and varied scenes, you feel like a captain of a huge starship fighting through the solar system in believeable ways. No description, however, can give justice to the experience of the campaign. You honestly control your ship, from you and your fighter's loadout, to all-stealtjh assasination missions to dog fights, the campaign is as long as you want it to be. If you get CoD Infinite Warfare and don't play the campaign, you are missing one of the best FPS campaigns ever written.  Zombies is a fantastic and wide co-op or single player gamemode. Fun, great, huge map with interesting and funny story, great acting and good gameplay that the player can easily sink many more hours into. It's comparable to the Multiplayer and certainly just as large.  Given the size and quality of the Campaign, Multiplayer and Zombies, this is a game I have no issues sinking 60 USD into. This game is amazing: don't be jaded towards Infinityward and enter the campaign with an open mind, what you will experience is fantastic. Enjoy.",

Pros:  -Actually quite fun to play multiplayer.  -Awesome zombies map and new wonderweapon  -Run well on my pc FX8350 and Nvidia GTX 1060 no fps drop  Cons:  -Poor lobby match making in zombies and multiplayer. -Can only play TDM cannot play another mode at all. -Kill time is somewhat short and unfair -Not noobs friendly -Poor match making for zombies require 4 players to join the game instead of going with 2 or 3 people. -Lack of guns, using varient and supply drop to substitute for the better guns. -Mouse and keyboard sometime throw it self out of place. Poor mouse optimization for PC.  Bottomline:  I reccomend this game for players that love the COD series and wanting new experience in zombies. As for multiplayer there are not much difference at all from BO3. There are team mission for you to grind for better guns. But it's not as good as BO3 where every one can unlock everything and be somewhat on equal ground.  ",

Don't 'over think' it - simply drop in, shoot a bunch of stuff, (or blow it up) and leave again. Team work is advised, but quite unnecessary. That said, it's best enjoyed with a few like minded and similarly skilled friends.   Some people feel that this is too similar to the preceding games. I would disagree, because this definitly plays better than either BO3 or Advanced Warfare. That said, it does demand that you run and gun all the time - sniping iasn't satisfying unless you treat the sniper rifle as a sort of rail gun. (And I'm noit skilled enough for that.)   Overall, its a highly addictive experience, crammed full of tricks to make you crave one more go. Don't beleive the negative comments. It's a genuine blast.",

Game plays out like a mix of Starcraft 2 / Mass Effect / your traditional Call of Duty control schemes.  Plot's little bit dull, but the freedom of choice given in the game is pretty inspiring.  For instance, missions are no longer linear. You are going after targets one by one, in order you want.  Finishing missions will give you various perks and aircraft upgrades on top of equipment upgrades.  Out on the field, you have to pick up weapons in order to be able to use it in your loadouts later.  Aerial combat can be little strange at the first glance, but game does not penalize you much on collision accidents.  I had no expectation going in, and like many others, I was reeled in because of the Modern Warfare Remaster.  I am pleasantly surprised. Perhaps it's the low expectation talking.

The worst thing is mouse acceleration probably, but I kinda forgot it later on in the game. Multiplayer is as always regular CoD, fast-paced you get a few hits you die. The only thing I don't like about it is maps, and oh god they suck. While playing multiplayer for around 3 hours I found only one that I liked, but I never saw it again so far. Zombies... I've never been a fan of zombies, so I didn't like this type of zombies either. I guess it looks cool, and the whole card system is alright, but i'm not liking the whole zombies thing at all. Overall the game is probably like a 7 out of 10, but I wouldn't say that it's very bad, I liked the idea and everything, but when they release new CoD every year they lack something new.

I'm going to review each part of the game, and then review as a whole based on my review of the parts.  IW Campaign: Haven't played yet.  IW Multiplayer: I have to be honest here. It is miles better than what I thought it would be. Going in, I thought it was going to be a lot like Black Ops 3 and Advanced Warfare: Everyone jumps around and you die. But in Infinite Warfare, I felt like I didn't have to use the Exo abilities in order to win a close gunfight, or traverse the map. It feels like an optional ability rather than something that I originally felt was necessary in order to win a game. Overall, I've been having a lot of fun with this mode.  IW Zombies in Spaceland: When it came to Advanced Warfare Zombies, and of course Extinction (but I think we choose not to remember that) I was sort of discouraged when I heard there was going to be another zombies mode not done by Treyarch. Boy was I wrong. This mode draws a very close parallel to what can be experienced in Treyarch zombies, and honestly does not feel that different. Aside from a couple new gameplay elements, some new perks, and an amazing map, Zombies in Spaceland exceeded my expectations as a mode, and I have been spending a lot of time playing it. Also, David. ♥♥♥♥ing. Hasselhoff.  Modern Warfare Remaster Campaign: While most COD campaigns basically hold your hand through the entire thing, the graphics look great, and I can't wait to actually sink my teeth into this mode in more depth.  Modern Warfare Remaster Multiplayer: Not only does it look damn good, but it felt great to get back to the older style COD without having to run into hackers in every damn server I joined. I had an amazingly good time playing some TDM on this. The guns, movement, and HUD all stay very true to the original, and it feels very nostalgic to play. Really well done.  As a whole, the game(s) are really really good. They perform well (on my rig, about 65-90 constant FPS) and don't really have that many bugs if any to mess up the experience. One small thing that I dislike is preloading shaders at launch of the title, but the super quick loading times make up for it by a longshot. The graphics are really vibrant and pretty, and while not as good as a game like Battlefield 1 which runs on a whole different engine, they are still really nice for a Call of Duty title. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a newer COD to maybe get themselves reinvolved with the franchise/ Overall 8.9/10.

I have no interest in the multiplayer side of the game. My comp is 16gb ram, i7-6700k, GTX 980 Ti.  Technicals:  The game runs very well on my system. There are no issues what so ever. I was a bit put off by the graphics though. While they do pass for a AAA game, I feel they're missing some elements in the graphics. They feel a little too simplistic. I'm not sure whether it's ambient lighting, or god rays or something, but it's missing something or a few things.   Don't get me wrong. They do pass and therefore I can get on with playing the game. The graphics are what they need to be to tell a story on a modern machine. But I was expecting more. Doom's game engine has more in it than this game, so I'm a bit amazed that this is lacking.  Campaign:  I am enjoying the campaign. In fact, I am enjoying it quite a lot. Normally in these FPS campaign games there's reasons to run into a room and search out every nook and cranny - even though the NPC's are telling you hurry up because of some time pressing serious issue. In this game, there's no reason to look at every nook and cranny simply because there's nothing to interact with. While some people might find that boring, when combined with a campaign that is linear and in a war setting where you're playing a soldier, it means you can get on with the action. As such the game feels more realistic - as if you are actually the protagonist performing your role. In other games, you'd be expected to do x immediately, but instead you'd stuff about with currently irrelevent consoles and other computer terminals just to see what's there. I like this direct, focused, linear way of doing things for a war person - it makes sense and creates more immersion.  Overall I give the campaign a good thumbs up. If you like to look around for secrets and other hidden things, then this probably isn't the game for you. If you like in combat action with a focused agenda that leads you on a linear path without needing to explore every corner and you're interersted in a good campaign, then this is for you. I can't say whether this is a good campaign compared to other CoD games, because I've never played them. But I'm satisfied with this campaign.

The game has no micro-transactions, its not pay to win, its not super unbalenced, its not terrible buggy. If people actually gave it a try, i think that many people would enjoy it. So if you are wondering if the game is decent, i think its pretty fun. Just my opinion. i give it an 8/10",

The wall running and slide is not clunky it just has been slowed down for a slower pace then b03. Which in my opinion was needed. The guns all sound nice there fun to play with. The maps are nice cool maps good spawn points. It's a fun game give it a chance. Its optimzed people who said it it's not do not understand the concept of lowering settings to get it going.

            "review_text": "This impression goes off OT sometimes.. but this is because unlike previous years.. there are several good games released simultaneously. But the short version is: Campaign is good, but more like Wing Commander, and have nothing to do with CoD (rename?) MP? no.. skip this title for that. Get Titanfall 2, which is better than any other game released this month.  The longer version..  This game feels like it is party Wing Commander, and portions of Star Citizen. I don't know if this game is a kind of a field test in that direction, but I hope that it is. Because judging from the components they do have some solid ground to build on here. They would need to work on prodecural planets, and such. But all of those are connectivity issues. As for the main areas of interest. They seem to already have what they need to put something together in that redard. I know this is off topic, but I honestly want someone to put a bit of heat on Chris Roberts. He seems to be stuck in feature creep land. Anyway, back on topic... is this game good? Yes it is... I know the usual cry babies who are angry about the inclusion of the remake in the price... boohooo.. I'll give a perfectly fine game an -1.. because... I'm crying. No, this game is good... is it game of the year material? No, absolutely not. But it is OK. The story is like most mid range movies you would see off something like Netflix. An OK night, with some chips and a beer. I feel they could have spent more time working on the characters, and try telling a story with a bit more voice. I think BF1 actually did better this time, with their longer scenes. Although I think the BF1 'campaign' is woefully short. If it could be called a campaign at all? But the thing is, they fleshed their characters better, and did give them more space than in this game. Same goes for Titanfall 2 (I got it because it had a campaign this time.. I didn't buy the first one because it lacked it) which is actually really good. I think Titanfall 2 is actually the best game of all three I mentioned. It is such a shame it got so hurt by the placement between BF1 &amp; IF, and not to mention the lack of marketing by EA. A real shame... buy that game. Off track again, but there you go.. this game is enjoyable. But you need to look at this game as something new. It doesn't really have much in common with previous titles at all. And I do hope they try going after the void that Wing Commander have left... this game proves (at least to me) that they can fill those shoes. They should probably have called this game something else other than 'call of Duty' because it doesn't feel like it have anything at all to do with those games. This feels like a new IP, and should have been treated that way. I do recommend this game, because it is enjoyable... no matter what other issue you have about a remake being forced in a purchase etc..",

I'll tell ya what they did they went backwards with Infinite warfare and totally forwards with the REMASTERED copy the proof is in the pudding this time just take a look yourself The Devs have tripped over their own feet this time and laid all out to bare.

Here's what they need to fix/change:  -Time-to-kill : It's WAYYY too fast, i don't even know how they released a game like that. -Uncap FPS to atleast 144fps (It's pc man...) -Graphics (stuttering and sht, i know it's hard when they didn't have a beta for pc..Probly next update)  -Mouse sens settings and input lag.

There arent much to say without spoiling the story so you should really give it a try.  Multiplayer Personally, i like the Multiplayer. It is just like black ops 3, but better. In my opinion i dont think people should compare IW to BO3. They arent made to be the same. Yes, the games look and play simular but they are two completely different games. Infinity Ward in the past maybe didnt care about pc, but so far Infinity Ward has cared a lot about pc. They rewrote a whole update just for pc. if you ask me they learned from ghosts.  Zombies I could go on for hours on why Zombies in Spaceland is an amazing map. To start this map is really stupid and/or funny. It isnt serious at all compared to Treyarch Zombies. Here it is simple. It is basicly another der riese in some aspects. You activate Teleporters and go through them to get to pack a punch. all the teleporters lead to one place just as Der Riese. After you linked all the Teleporters you can go into the main portal and pack a punch. Infinity Ward's take on zombies is very good and i think you should try it if you havent.",

Its just plain not fun. Now let me say i only played the multiplayer, because im not a huge singleplayer guy, so i cant speak for the SP. But from the little i played, it was not fun. Alot of stuff is infuriating (the brecci 2.0), the gunplay feels weird, the stupid 'change mode' guns are stupid. Also, as insult to injury. its a 70 GB download. 70 ♥♥♥♥ing Gigabytes. How much extra useless ♥♥♥♥ did they cramm in this game. GTA V is 68 GB, and what do you think has more content and replayability.   TLDR: Dont recommend, unless 1.diehard CoD fan 2.Liked Blops 3. But still its a tough sell.",

As a brief background I would like to say that I played the earlier Call of Duty games (up to the first Black Ops) and this game is my re-entrance back into the series. After playing Battlefield 1 for a while it is refreshing to play an FPS where there are no vehicles and smaller maps. I can understand why some are tired of 'futuristic gameplay' but to someone just coming back to the series it is great to play a COD game again.  *I have yet to play with people who I felt were hacking **I have been a little dissapointed with the lack of people online",
