If you're farmiliar with musical lingo, and fluent in reading sheet music, then this game will become one of the most entertaining and musically stimulating experiences.   Have you noticed I've been refering to it as an experience? Well, I mean, this is one of the only titles I know in which you can import in speedcore techno and rock out while going through a horribly difficult bullet hell, and immediately swap over to something calm and classical while stil destroying interesting and yet heavily frustrating enemy types.  Pros: Can import ALMOST any song and play it to your difficulty level Awesome menu music Fun upgrades and weapons Replayibility Auto fire options  Cons:  You cannot import songs longer than 10 minutes Can get painfully difficult Bosses are spontainious and impossible to predict their encounters Enemies can be unforgiving if you lose a ship part Upgrading ship parts gets really expensive  Overall 8/10. Buy it if you like bullet hell shooters, or even just arcade style games.",

            "review_text": "Let me start by saying that I really want to like this game. I really really do. But I just cannot do it.  Starting with the good things: - The game does a very good job creating levels based on the music. I feel like it's really responding to the beats, tempo changes, and dynamics of a particular song. It feels like each level was tailored to that song. - At lower levels, it's a very good pseudo-bullet-hell game and more enjoyable because it has your own music. - The weapon customization and points scaling to the power of your ship gives plenty of challenge and allows for different play styles.  Now the bad things that make me ultimately not want to recommend this game all revolve around its status as a pseudo-bullet-hell game, mostly at the higher difficulties. Bullet-hell games are supposed to be hard--even infuriating--but they are also fair. This one is not. Allow me to explain:  - Your ship's hitbox is NOT equal to its visual size. Time and time again I was taking damage from enemies that did not physically touch my ship, but hit an outer corner of the (I assume) rectangle that makes up your hitbox. When there are 20+ enemies to dodge, it becomes really problematic knowing you have to clear out more space than your ship is big. - There seems to be no consistency for damage. Sometimes I can sandbag 4+ collisions and survive, other times it's a one-hit-KO. Or I can take 2-3 bullets and survive, other times I'm outright dead. I tried to pay attention to the enemies that damage me, to see if it was different enemy classes, but as far as I can tell, it's not. It seems honestlly to be a total crapshoot if a hit will kill or not. - The weapons, while varied, lack power on the higher levels. You basically have to use the 'furia' weapons (roughly a 5% drop rate per song) in order to stand a chance on the highest level. Often I was finding that I literally could not destroy a wave of enemies before they got to the bottom of the screen (and this is without contending with the other 20+ enemies on screen at the time). You basically have to grind until you get the rare-and-slightly-more-powerful weapons for the hard difficulty to be doable (at least as far as completion is concerned, maybe not survival). - Lots of enemies spawn behind you, which is fine as some weapons shoot backwards. But for some reason, while you can rotate your weapons, you cannot flip them to shoot backwards, so your ship is just naturally weaker firing behind it than in front of it. This becomes a problem when 1/3 of the enemies spawn at the bottom of the screen (especially the larger ones, which brings me back to the hitbox issue) and your strongest weapons literally cannot hit them.  So to summarize, I want to like this game, but I do not. If you're not so obsessed with the shooter aspect, you'll probably love it, and I get that. But I just cannot recommend it on these grounds.",

            "review_text": "In Short:   This game is for those who like 2D plane slightly angled from top-down shoot em' ups in which one is predominantly dodging and destroying enemies that move and act in response to the tempo and all else of ones' (favorite) audio over a minute and thirty seconds long (that is on the computer you are playing on), then this game is for you.  Note: The enemies rarely fire at you, but unlike bullet-hells, you're entire ship is the hitbox, so enemies can be smashed into, but it will damage your ship. Luckily you can repair it via collecting 'Music Notes' (dropped points) from enemies one has shot to death after your ship lost part of itself (took damage).   Notice, any audio over 1:30 minutes will do, so for you oddballs out there who feel like playing to audiobooks or whatever else you come up with, have fun.    In Depth:  Warning... there are probably spoilers (if you think there can be spoilers for a shoot 'em up that is not a bullet-hell)... they are more of descriptions of how the game works... which is why I think it is good...   Any audio over a minute thirty long can be used to play the game.  One have 4 guns that are individually rotatable, all of which they can individually be bound to left click to fire, right click to fire, or always (infinite) fire... the game can be really easy on the fingers due to the infinite fire mode.  One can move ones' ship around the screen with your mouse much like you would a cursor.  Each of those 4 guns and the parts of ones' ship they mount to can be destroyed, as well as the entire ship itself if the center of it gets hit. The ship comes with 4 stock guns. All weapons can be upgraded to level 5 (the higher the level the deadlier of course) based off of points/point goals on songs that you finish playing through.  Ones' ship usually loses parts/gets destroyed when you crash into enemies or on the occasions' they shoot you (or you get to close to certain units and they blow up). Luckily you can repair it via collecting 'Music Notes' (dropped points) from enemies one has shot to death after your ship lost part of itself (took damage).   When one dies one respawns seconds later (may feel like forever if your invested in the level) and as one defeat bosses that randomly get attributed to songs one plays. Each boss unlocks part of a sheet of the Symphony of Souls. Each page represents a higher difficulty level to unlock... so yes... one starts off weak, but sit back and enjoy the audio whilst it is easy if you are a Hardcore player, otherwise keep it easy or do as you wish.  The game comes with pre-stocked music from a handful of genres... but I shall not review it, for everyone has their preferences and it is limited compared the amount of music one loves that one will probably add to it to play.    The long opinion filled babble-esque review follows that might have as many 'spoilers,' if not more, as above:  You may actually listen to rather than just hear your songs for once since your focusing on playing your song rather than having audio in the background as you focus on something else.  Playing a game whilst having an excuse to listen to your (favorite) music without having to listen to the games audio... always grand... but there is nothing like playing a shooter that integrates and interacts with your music/audio files that are a minute in a half or longer. The proof the game interacts is the pace of the enemies, color of the background, and the subwoofer weapon...  This game is unique in that it has 4 weapon slots and one can customize which way the weapons face on the ship, the ships weapons (and ship itself) can be destroyed... but as long as the ship remains intact, one can collect music (drops) from deceased enemies to repair ones' ship. One can also configure any of the weapons to independently of one another fire with the left/right mouse buttons and infintie fire (2 guns on left click, the 3rd on infinite fire, the 4th on right click, sure, all on any of them, all the power to you, etc.)  One can upgrade weapons, but if one is not very good at the game, one simply has to play more songs on the lower difficulty levels to get the points required to upgrade weapons. 2 point systems, one is based off the score you received upon finishing a level, and the other is based off reaching set scores for that difficulty for that song... both of which are required to upgrade weapons... the former of the two is only required to unlock weapons... and there is only 1 weapon unlock per song.  Every song is processed by the game the first time you play the song, in order to generate that level (difficulty is irrelevant). The processing process also decides if a boss will be attributed to that song (thus there will never be a boss on a level you have not played). There is a timer to defeat the boss, if one fails to defeat the boss may move to a different difficulty level in the same song, but will still be attributed to that song.  One unlocks (parts of) sheet music... the Symphony of Souls... as one does so one unlocks higher difficulties. The bosses get progressively harder to defeat. When one defeats a boss that song is freed (no fighting a boss on that song again).  Is that enough babbling? Now go play the game to Portal's 'Still Alive' song(s)... they are free after all... Steam Music... and yes there is a way to download them without having the game installed... it is just a pain for it requires console commands... you might catch that the game is out of Beta on time... I never heard that before playing the song in Symphony.",

            "review_text": "You know when you just fall in love with a song that you can't stop listening to? But then 50 listens later you start to get sick of the song and shove it in a music folder that builds up of over years, and now you have a big folder of music you know every word to and every beat, that it's pointless playing as you can rehearse the entire song in your head? Well now you can play all those songs one last time but while killing a ton of visually hypnotic geometric 'things'.   Pros:  You get to play an arena whose visuals and enemies attack to the tune of your music. The visuals are very hypnotic and very smooth blending of colours and effects. You can customise what and how your ship shoots, by changing weapons or the angle they fire. Progression on ship upgrading and unlocking difficulties. Bosses that appear mid song that you must destroy. Leaderboards for the included songs, I believe there's one for own songs too but I guess you and friends need the exact same file in order for it to work. (Don't quote me on this)   Cons:  Only 2 colours, well main colours anyway, I would have liked to see full on rainbows or different colours depending on the music. I wish more geometric attacking 'things' would warp the music. Only encountered one that changes audio balance. OP square sniper things, I hate them! I hate them so much! Especially the smaller ones on Hard+  My cons are quite personal, I really enjoy the game and couldn't really find anything 'con'ish, but there could definitely be improvements.   General Opinion  I like the game, It's something you'll wanna keep installed and just play a few tunes every so often. It does start a little slow and easy but if you push up the difficulties a bit, at around medium you'll start to realise firing backwards becomes pretty important. Then by Hard you're just confused at where you need to shoot. Enemies become more difficult to kill and you keep getting hammered from the sides and behind. It gets crazy, but awesome crazy. I'd say if you have a big music folder you'll have a lot of fun replaying all your songs while murdering a really angry music demon from another dimension.  As a side-note; I played this on GNU/Linux (Ubuntu LTS), Only had one mouse problem where after each game I had to move the mouse to each corner of the screen otherwise it hit an invisible edge. Other than that the game ran flawlessly, and wouldn't hold a little bug like that against it.",

Do you enjoy bright, flashy poly style designs using whatever MP3's (without the addon) you have kicking around on your drives? Then take a look at this game. I got it on sale, for half the price and I played the heck out of it.    I'm reading people complaining about dying alot, and yes-you will at times on the harder settings. It gives you a large range of difficulty settings, you have to unlock them as you go, but it slowly builds you up to being ready for the harder levels. You don't need to play the higher difficulty, it's not required-but it makes the game more of a challenge and improves it, in my opinion. The levels generate around the songs, if you play a slow low ballad, you'll have enemies spawn out the sides at a slower speed, following the flow of the songs. IF you play some kind of heavy metal/speed metal or dance tune with massive guitar speed runs then you best be ready to move like a rabbit in traffic or die. But, it allows you to load your favorite tunes, which I enjoyed the most. You're not dependant on playing songs you don't like/listen to and drudge your way through them, it's not genre or style specific. I played the entire game from start to finish with my mouse and it ran great, I almost tried it with my Xbox contoller, but the mouse worked so well I couldn't be bothered. The other pro to this game is the tweaking of your ship, you can equip up to four different weapons, mix and match however you like. The weapons cap out at a level five, preventing over powered ships, different load outs help on different levels. Like.. a have bass song.. use the sub weapon.   The only thing that really bothered me was the intros to the demons you fight (trapped composers), they were overly cheesy and I get it, they're part of the attempt at a narrative here. But it doesn't really work. I as a gamer don't need a cheesy monologue from a pair of eyes to build me up for a boss fight, the bosses were enough on their own.    Is this game perfect? No. Is it a good-decent shooter? Yes.  Should I play this game if I dislike shooters or are no good at them and get super frustrated with them easily? No. You shouldn't, unless you feel like improving your skills and want to try something different.  Is it worth the money? Yes. You'll get a few hours of solid fun out of this, and you can load it up and play any time without having to worry about forgetting everything in between, because the story line is barely there enough to matter. (Note: Now, granted if you really only play games for the story then you'll probably feel let down here.)",

The game itself is pretty fun and entertaining, but the gameplay could use a load of improvements.  You can't control the ship's directional shots, you can only rotate the (for lack of a better word) 'cannons' before you start a song.  The enemies are so ♥♥♥♥ing Over-Powered, and most of the time, they come from behind you, and you can't do ♥♥♥♥, because you can't change the direction your ship's shooting towards, and when dodging enemies from above, I often go downward and ♥♥♥♥ing crash into the ♥♥♥♥ing ships that are below me that I can't ♥♥♥♥ing hit. The game does have Xbox360 controller support (Thankfully!), but not full controller support -- In the menus you have to use your mouse, and even to pause the ♥♥♥♥ing game you have to let go of your controller to press the 'esc' button on your keyboard. In the middle (Usually in the beginning, though) a ♥♥♥♥ing demon will interrupt your 'fun', and challenge you. It gets really ♥♥♥♥ing annoying when I just want to play a ♥♥♥♥ing song and not battle a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ boss. Seriously, what the ♥♥♥♥? Add a ♥♥♥♥ing 'Boss Mode' to the ♥♥♥♥ing game, if you really want to show off those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses. It seems as if all of the enemies have random amounts of health, because when I shoot one enemy 3 ♥♥♥♥ing times, it goes down, but another (Same kind of enemy) only takes 1 or 2 hits. The game is so ♥♥♥♥ing confusing. You can't purchase new weapons, you can only 'Unlock' them... And most of the time, the unlocked ones are complete ♥♥♥♥. It only has 'Story-Mode', and lacks a relaxation/free-play mode. (Free-play meaning no ♥♥♥♥ing story, relaxation meaning easier/no enemies and just to enjoy the view.) The songs have to be, at least, 1:30 in order to 'Create level.'  However, the game does look really radical... I'll give it that.  Bottom line: The game's only worth $4.99, if that.  Maybe if the game had: FULL controller support, Directional controls, (Doesn't matter, but it's always better with) Multiplayer, Easier enemies/less OPed enemies, And a ♥♥♥♥ing free-play mode, It'd be worth $8.99, But not how it is right now.  If you like the look (Or just) this game, try out Beat Hazard, if you don't already have it. The gameplay is better, has Full Controller Support, you can purchase perks, have less OPed enemies, (they do have bosses, but the game warns when one's coming, and it's not a ♥♥♥♥ing demon that starts talking and sounds like a broken record player being voiced by Mel Tillis,) the game is still getting updated, with new DLC on the way, and is just overall more fun.  P.S: Don't EVER use the ♥♥♥♥ing Shotgun, because it sucks more ♥♥♥♥ than a ♥♥♥♥♥ on a busy day.",

I got this version as part of a bundle sale. Anyways, on to the review.  When I first saw this game, I was fascinated by the idea of a musical shooter game because I loved playing Galaga as a kid and I love music games, including AudioSurf, Stepmania, and more recently, Sequence. So I bought this as part of a sale and needless to say, after an hour of playing the game, I was hooked... and then I lost interest. Just read the pros/cons.  +++Pros+++ + Great idea for a music game, but there's a catch. + Great visuals, definitely sets the 'music' tone. + Neat weapon customization, but, like the first pro, there's a catch.  ---Cons--- - Occasional textual glitches. - The weapon customization comes off to be quite dull &amp; limited when you realize how many unlockable weapons there are (I found like eight plus a stronger version of them) and only one unlockable power-up pickup. - Towards the end of the game, the difficulty becomes so frustrating that most of the choices of weapons will be omitted and you'll be practically forced to use a few certain weapons, and even those aren't good enough. You'll die and lose points a lot. - I don't feel as if the songs I pick really have an effect on the way the game is played. Sure the higher-adrenaline songs have faster/more enemies, but I feel like the beats to the music don't really affect the gameplay. Audiosurf had pickups based off the music beats and Sequence had you hit the arrow keys to the beat of the song. - Lots of potential that I feel went wasted, at least for a music game.  Did I like Symphony? At first I did, and even with all those cons, I feel Symphony could be a time-waster game, but it's not worth the $9. I'd buy it on sale for like $2.50. Unfortunately as the game gets on, it gets worse, and those flaws get more and more noticeable.",

            "review_text": "I'm sorry. I really want to recommend this game, but I can't. (TL:DR at the bottom)  First, let me say, the menus look great, and are easy to work with. There's tons of weapons to add to your ''ship'' as you fight against enemies.  Having said that: The graphics can sometimes become confusing. You don't always have fully control over everything, as you simply cannot see everything. Dying simply because you didn't see an attack coming might happen to you a lot, but, on the other end, you have unlimited lives. The controller support, which was later added, feels rushed and unnatural, and isn't without bugs.   The storyline isn't exactly clear. Personally I have no problems with that, IF there was a way to avoid it. I don't want to go all deep on that, because I haven't played through it for 100% yet, and there may still be stuff to come. I'm at 40% now, and I still don't know why someone would want to infect my music library. On the store page I can't find it either.  A bigger issue is when you try to play a few songs. It scans the song you want to play, and lets you. As an example, I've taken the songs ''3:45 - No sleep'' by the Cardigans, a really, really slow song, and Young, by Tulisa, a fast dance track, with lots of variation. The enemies were moving faster and coming in at a much higher rate in the song by The Cardigans (Which is also, looking at Beats per minute, a much, much slower song) than when playing the dance track. This didn't happen on 1 occasion: Loading up another few songs gives the same impression. Other than some detections in beats, used for weapons, the game doesn't really seem to be doing anything with the song, other than playing it.  TL:DR, Pros: - Nice menus - Lots of customisations - Graphics do look nice and run well on my mediocre system  Cons: - Graphics may become confusing - Game does not seem to actually be using the library - Controller support feels rushed in and unnatural - Plot might/has holes in it  Final verdict: It's good if you want an arcade shooter. If you want to be interacting with your music library, take a look at Audiosurf instead.",

You'll be using your mouse to move your ship around, while shooting from 4 different angles with your guns while the game generates the enemies based on your choice of music. If your music is (reaching an) up-tempo (part) then the field will become red and more enemies will arrive. Shooting down enemies will result in giving you points. These points will place you on a leaderboard when the song is over. Shooting enemies will also give you random, upgradeable weapons and power-ups.

Half the time I had no idea what I was doing in the game. Sure the main thing of a shooter is to shoot enemies, but even that needs to have a goal or objective. Symphony gives the story of how your music is being attacked by muisc demons and these mosnter are it's supposed minions. That's the context but I've not actually felt any motivation for shooting them.  This is an issue with the enemies themselves. They are not very memorable and are boring. They fly by in eradic manners that does not emulate the music at all and never seem to be very fun blowing them up. Sometimes it becomes a chore as they are not very difficult to put down but they have a high amount of health and require many bullets before they are destroyed  Music being the main selling point of this game, this game seems to use little or none of the muisc itself. Either that or the music annaylse algorithum is borked... I never felt like the game is influenced by music. Rock music has high ammount of muisc, quiet music has slow lesser amount of enemies.... Other than that the variation between songs is non existant.  The visuals at first was really pretty, I like the crystaline structure as it has a very clean serene feeling to it... unfortunately this gets boring and annoying fast. They never really take anything of the structure to create an environment, the enenmies conisst of boring shape that are repeated with no variations or imagination and the colour can be distracting and annyoing as it blends the bullets and enemies so that it becomes unnoticeable when they are shooting and ramming into you.  The weapon unlocking systme and progression can only be described with the pace of molasis. It's confusing, makes little sense, and doesn't feel very rewarding to progress. Why, because it unlocks more of the same thing without variations.  But the bottom line is, Symphony is not a muisc game, it's not visually appealing, and take away the gimmick aspect it's not a very well made game either.",

The leaderboards also work a lot better than Audiosurf's. If you're like me, you'll be saving your most epic songs for when the bosses are likely to spawn. Such a practice was worth it, I found.  Symphony is one of those games that hooks the player in and doesn't let go. A simple but effective sense of progression that relies on your awesome array of music, the concept is one guaranteed to grab ahold of anyone in love with their music. I did beat the game within about a day but most of that is down to how much I was playing it. And needless to say, you can still play through your music collection without the story after the game is finished.  As far as flaws go, nothing really crippled the experience for me. Some songs were harder to find so I think the menus could be improved. Maybe add a search/sort function. Also some songs get blared out by the game's sound effects as a result of the song being low in volume, so perhaps the game could utilise some audio leveling there.  If you've got a collection of awesome songs, definitely get Symphony. That's as simple as it is. An engrossing experience for a low price.",

The concept is pretty neat, the story gets you along without cluttering anything at all (albeit a bit short) and while the gameplay is simple, this game has the best replayability ever: every new song, every new track you acquire is a new challenge. You could keep playing this game for years. I know I will.  For a casual game, you can't get better. Infinite replayability (even once you have acquired all rare weapons) and a solid challenge for everyone.  Cons? No gamepad support, and you have to buy a $1 USD add-on to be able to play your iTunes songs natively.

The gameplay, I have to say, isn't all that innovative - shoot'em ups have been done over and over for decades, but this one is a little different. The music recognition system varies up the gameplay a lot - slow and calm songs will make enemies appear in an orderly fashion, fast and complex songs will make enemies appear quickly from all around, putting your hand-eye coordination to the test. The music recognition isn't perfect, but does its job - the gameplay gets more frantic with higher tempo, special enemies appear at fitting moments, and the subwoofer weapon fires stronger the louder a song's bass line is. You can play any song at any difficulty level, unlocking higher difficulty levels over time. This way, the game is easy the first time you pick it up, but can turn into a bullet hell shooter by the end. Plus, it has that 'just one more level' effect that makes it addictive - you want to find out how this song is gonna look like, what item that song will get you, etc. The graphics of the game aren't technologically mind-blowing, but look gorgeous and sparkling with colors. The music, of course, is the best there is - your own ;). The few tracks that are included are nothing special and you'll need to add more to unlock more and better weapons. Personally, I sometimes think of this game as an advanced music visualizer, not only displaying pretty shapes, but also allowing you to interact with music. I think of it less as a shooting challenge, and more as a fun way to listen to music.",

If that sounds like Beat Hazard to you, then yes it does, only this is nowhere near as fun as Beat Hazard.  Right of the bat the game loses points for trying to shoehorn story elements into a game that really don't need it and is happy to interrupt your game at annoying times with unskipable 'cutscenes', which is nothing but some glowing eyes popping up on the screen and trying to be intimidating before you get a popup message about 'how evil this thing is and it is destroying your music, you need to stop it'. Cheesy bad stories like that can have their charm, but in this case it's just unecessary and kinda lame. The tutorial of the game is also mandotory and also very happy to interrupt and annoy you.  I will give them credit for trying a interesting approach to the gameplay, by having your ship set at a fixed angle and the enemies coming in from the side most of the time, making dodging a bigger part of the game than in some other similar games where it is more about downing the enemy before it comes close to you, but all in all not being able to turn your ship becomes more annoying than a fun challenge really quickly. It's not even particularly hard, you have infinite extra lives and you regain health from picking up enemy drops, it's just mildly annoying. The weapons you unlock for beating songs really don't do much to change up gameplay beyond doing more damage or having different ammo either, and after 3 songs, one which included a boss battle, I was already bored.  The song setlist sorting is also poorly handled. Instead of the system used in Beat Hazard where you load one and one folder and can freely decide which subfolders to use, this game will automatically use ALL subfolders in a selected folder no matter what, so if you have all your music saved in the 'My Music' folder but have subfolders in there with song stems, multitracks, demo versions etc. look forward to having to scroll through pages of stems. This is somewhat combated with available filters for albums and songs, but that doesn't help when it comes to WAV files who don't have that info saved in the files. Oh yeah, you also need a arbritary additional login inside of the game for your scores to be uploaded, which is just odd.  I don't think the music gimmick was handled very well either, and I never felt like the music I picked had much to do with how the levels turned out. Seemed to be the same enemies and same lightshow no matter what I picked, and I wish they would have done more to make it feel like the music matters.  All in all, a mediocre game that I don't know why it exist in a world that already has Beat Hazard, a much better shoot-em-up spaceship game that uses the music gimmick to much better effect. It's ok if you like the genre and see it on a 70% sale, but it's not worth the current asking price IMO.",

It plays a bit like Galaga, although you have much more control over how you move your ship. The music you chose changes when the enemies enter the screen and how fast they move, and sometimes alters their firing patterns. It's kinda hard to pick up on when it's happening, though. The effect is far more apparent and noticible on something that focuses on a strong beat rather than other instruments (Teeth by Lady Gaga is a good example of where you can see it easily). Progression is rewarding, as you unlock weapons and items to buy after beating any new song, and then use those to customize your ship. The biggest downside is that, as of right now, it's still somewhat buggy and a CPU hog, but the dev is working with the Steam community daily to put out new betas and fix these problems.  Not the best .mp3 game, but still pretty good.",

I got to say i played a wide selection of music and it adapted pretty well. Not perfect but then again nothing is. Highly Recommend It, If you have a large music collection like myself and like video games then this stuffs both of those passions into one. Honestly what more could you ask for? Now please understand if you don't care for music then no matter how cool the game looks you just won't get into it. It comes with some free songs included but the real fun starts when you take music from your collection and play. It can get addicting because you are always wondering....What would this song 'play' like? I got this game on sale but even at the regular price it just can't be beat if this is the kinda thing that interests you.",

The second problem is that third difficulty and so on the game screws you up real good, enemys spawn right where you spawn, they keep cornering you and then they throw that insta-kill ball and BOOM you're dead... there are unlockalable items in the game but most of them doesn't help.

You move your ship around with the mouse, shooting enemies on static paths while avoiding being shot or run into yourself. The game comes with a series of music, which I haven't really listened to, but the best part is you can use your own music library. Each song is a 'level' where you earn 2 different kind of points in order to unlock better weapons and abilities. The difficulty also incresaes with each level completed, and you can even select various difficulties if your song allows it. The enemies, who have 'infected' your music library, basically react (speed &amp; agressiveness) to the music. If you're familiar with the songs you can somewhat anticipate when things will get a bit more rough.  Game explaination aside, I find this a pretty fun game to pass the time. Each level is literally the length of the song, and the occasional 'boss duel' breaks up the staleness of doing virtually the same fight over and over again. The only downside I found to the game is during the enterance and exit of a boss duel when the 'eyes' take over the screen but the action isn't stopping in the background. It's very hard to see what you're doing and stay alive when the voice is exclaiming 'Ahhhhh!'...  That said, because you can use your own standard MP3 music files, I find this game very enjoyable and would honestly recommend it to anyone who loves mixing music with gaming.",

The volume of the music volume when is selected full music and no corruption setting, the volume is not truly the max, based on my soundcard, the volume is around 6.5db softer than it is played on a music player.  3. There isn’t a good music library update system. If there are music tags being edited such as album title, the game re-scanning does not pick up such changes, even after resetting all the folders to be scanned. 4. When starting the game, please allow players to skip the introductions instantly and jump to the main menu. And the main menu shall be clickable while fading in. 5. While choosing music or selecting folders, there isn’t a button found to return to the main menu or rescan the library.  6. Currently it only displays English characters and all other languages or symbols are displayed as squares.   Gameplay 1. The current music analysis is not impressive at all, I thought this game can replace those music visualisation most players offer, but it is not. Please make the shooting more relevant to the direction where the music is going to. Its ok to have longer load time as current analysis time is really short. 2. The sub-woofer detection is not really detecting the base drum. Based on what I see so far, the sub-woofer weapon only detects sharp volume changes or it will just follows the beat(sometime is upbeat) of music, especially when the overall music volume is loud. Please make it detect base line rhythms only. 3. Please make more dramatic visual appearance when the music gets the chorus or climax, the 1812 overture blast shall spawn more like at least every 4 bar have some other explosions during such climax or chorus.

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like Symphony just like I do all my other beat matching games, but it doesn't make the grade for me.  Symphony is a beautiful game, for what it is. It runs smooth on even the oldest of toasters. Most importantly, like other games in its genre offers the potential for seemingly endless replay value by being able to generate new levels based on data analysis from songs you provide. Seems like a pretty good deal, right?  Well, it could have been. A fundamental problem this game has is the levels it generates are not so great. One the mechanics this game has is that it will speed up the flow of enemies as the song intensifies, and slow down as the song resumes normal tempo. The accuracy of this process can be really hit or miss, which can make some songs frustratingly difficult or simply unfun to play through. Sometimes this mainfests itself as a floundering between mid and high intensities when the tempo isn't changing at random intervals, and on slower songs the sensitivity seems to go up and you end up with random spurts of intensity change for seemingly no reason. Enemies often pop in at random off-beat unless you are playing a song with an extremely pronounced beat, but there is often still some fuzz that seems to account for the time it takes the enemies to pile up at the edges of the map.  This seems to go hand-in-hand with the spawning of the mid-boss enemies that appear throughout the songs. I'm not against the concept of having them in the game since it makes you apply some strategy to survive the song with them around. What does irk me is they often appear at random which throws off the rhythm of killing other things on the map.  But then, of course, there is the actual boss fights. Nothing is more frustrating than dealing with one of the 'demons.' They spawn at random after you have made a fair amount of progress into a song, and disrupt both the flow of the course you were running, and also make it impossible to get a high score for that run. I think I would have preferred if they had dedicated or marked tracks that become available after a set amount of runs between demons so you could both ready yourself and play other songs without being disrupted.  On top of all of those things, your only real sense of fulfillment is the high score bulletin board. However, since nobody seems to actively play or submit scores there, you could spend the entire time you play the game on and off for years and nobody might ever see or challenge your score. Even on popular songs! That kinda blows, but it also gives you a good idea of just how many people stick around to play this game long term.  I could also go into the vague story they tried to bolt on as a form of plot advancement and to make it not seem so grindy, but it feels very forced and that is reflected on the erratic behavior of how demons are fit into the game (see above).  I'd say if you're trying to get into beat games like this for the first time, consider another game like Audiosurf or Beat Hazard. If you have those and just want to experience something akin to Galaga on acid, then this might be a better fit for you. If I could rate this game as 'meh' I would, but otherwise I don't think I would recommend this game to anyone.",

The harder levels are pretty intense, but that makes the challenge and mastering how to get better in such levels all the more fun, and when you just want to relaxedly play through your favourite songs, that's always an option too, and is very enjoyable as well to do. You will earn points at any rate to get upgrades for your ship, and unlock a new item for each new song you play regardless of the difficulty.
