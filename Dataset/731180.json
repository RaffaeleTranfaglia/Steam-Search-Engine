    "description": "Coffee Run is a 3D endless runner game in which you run through the city and collect coffee, coffee, and more coffee. The more you drink, the faster you run. Don't let your caffeine meter drop too low or you'll slow to a grinding halt! Also, watch out for the oncoming traffic!",
