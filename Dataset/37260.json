            "review_text": "Quite a fun game, also worked on by Wadjeteye Games and it is interesting when they do with the wizard of Oz lore. I quite enjoyed this and it's a nice short adventure game that I recommend to most anyone willing to have a go with it, not to mention it's quite cheap and easy to find online.  Unlike other Oz based things I've seen recently, this game adds to the lore instead of alters it and holds a lot of references to all the many different areas of Oz that you get to travel outside of the emerald city. You soon find yourself getting involved in a conspiricy that could plunge Oz into danger.",

            "review_text": "Emerald City is a short but entertaining point and click adventure that is probably best for kids but can keep grown ups entertained too. It is quite short.I think it took me about 5 hours to complete. In that sense it probably is a bit expensive but it is good entertainment.   The gameplay style is like an old Lucas Arts adventure in the sense you are mostly solving inventory and conversation based puzzles. The puzzles are logical but a bit easy.  It has a light-hearted, mock film-noir plot that is (obviously) not exactly mature but still well written and chock full of geekery about Frank Baum's original Oz books and plays.  The art is nice, the interface very straightforward, nice voice acting and a forgettable but adequate score  One bad thing: I was worried at the start about how easy it seemed to be. In particular when the main character gets a new objective you get alerted with a properly in your face, fruit-machine style pinging and flashes of colour. The first objectives are really basic - they only require a step or two. I started thinking that of the main character succesfully managed to open an unlocked door I might get a ping, a gem and an overly sparkly achievement.  But it got better. The objectives got to be mildly challenging and the story is properly engaging.   So I recommend this game although I think the playtime should put it at £5. If you've got a ten year old who likes adventure games they'll probably be a excited as I was playing Monkey Island back in the day.",
