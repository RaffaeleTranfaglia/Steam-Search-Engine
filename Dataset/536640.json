            "review_text": "*Edit - I made a few comment updates to this review, the updates are in a single paragraphs wherever you see '*Edit'. There is a tiny bit of new information but nothing has been changed otherwise.*  There is a lot of misinformation about this game, and I'm only really posting a review to correct some of it.  First yes, it *currently* is online only because it was meant to be an online game played with others. Nowhere in the description does it say 'Single Player'. Nowhere. It says it's an online survival game and single player isn't listed anywhere in the tags. And yet people buy it and complain there isn't an offline mode because it didn't hit them over the head enough with the warnings that it's an online game? It gets all the data from the server for the areas and such you're playing in. It's not as if it is just needing an online connection for no good reason. The game was made to be multiplayer and doesn't list itself as single player, and yet so many down vote the game because it doesn't come with something it never said it did. Anyway they're making an offline mode, which I can't say if it's a good idea or not for a game meant to be played online but it's coming down the line.  *Edit - I do admit they could have done a better job explaining this is a hub based 'light MMORPG'- and I feel they would have had more sales if they had done that. You see other random people in game if you're in the same town areas as they are and can group up with them to play together as well as friends you invite. Still they never said there was a single player mode anywhere so to complain that it's not single player is odd to me. It would be like complaining Guild Wars 1 didn't have an offline mode. These hub based light MMORPGs usually don't...*  Next the cut scenes - this game is based on the lore from the TV show Grimm. Nick and Hank are looking through one of Nick's books of Grimm for information, and you're basically playing what they're reading about. The cut scenes some people complain about that are just 'two guys looking at a book' - that's the whole connection to the TV show and if you've watched Grimm you'll be happy with having that there.  On to the 'slowness' of combat. You start out with a huge piece of tree and then a giant club you're fighting with. They are slow because they are meant to be more realistic. You're a Grimm that's stronger than a normal person by far but still these are pretty huge weapons you're swinging. You also start with a shield that's slower because of it's size. Later on you can switch to faster weapons and a much faster shield. Maybe they should have started you out with faster equipment so people would see how the game plays with them from the beginning, but they are an upgrade choice you are supposed to earn as you play.   I've had no issues at all with server lag, but my play time isn't very long yet so I'll keep playing and update a comment here if I do start to have server issues.  *Edit - Still no lag issues for me. The game is made to learn the patterns monsters use and to avoid or block them early. Some people play and think the game is being slow when it's performing like it is supposed to, but others may be out of the two server areas so actually would be having lag. I've not had even the smallest amount personally being a US based player.*  When I connected there was a US server and a server in Europe. Yes, if you are not in those areas maybe you will have issues playing. There isn't just one or two servers that go up to 600 people - if a server in a region gets full another will appear, so you always get to play. You're not locked out if you buy it and there are already 600 people online.  On to character creation - this is a little weird but you do have control over the look of your character it's just you have to let it randomly assign your look and then keep clicking to go through random looks. If you click the gender button on the character creation screen it will randomize your look. To get what you want you have to keep clicking the gender button of your choice and wait until it randomly comes up with a look you like. It's weird and a bit annoying but not unheard of. The way they do it definitely leans towards the 'con' side, but you *do* have the ability to keep rolling random looks until you find what you like. So you're not just forced to look one certain way. I'm guessing some people just never pressed the gender buttons up top to see that it randomly changes the look each time you press one or the other.  The game is supposed to feel more like being in the real wilderness, so there are some open stretches without as many things to fight on them as some people are looking for I guess. Having played other 'survival' types of games it really isn't too much different than the way a lot of them are made like that.  If you're a Grimm fan you'll probably be pretty happy. Being a Grimm fan myself, I am probably influenced towards liking this a bit more than I would have otherwise. The game is fun to me and I would recommend it.   I can't really say if it should be $15 or $10 though yet because I need to play the game a lot more to decide.  *Edit - Yeah it's worth the $15. The landscape seems repetitive if you stay in the same areas searching for stuff a long time, but the environment does change around a bit as you continue further into the game. I do wish there was more variety earlier on, it's so beautiful, but it does change up slowly. The game also gets much more active as you go along with lots of dangerous creatures all over. It starts up a bit slow with mostly normal woodland creatures but it won't be long until you're swimming in harder and more interesting stuff.*  If you want the solo offline version you'll need to wait until they update it to say it's here. If you like playing multiplayer games with friends on Steam and you both get this, it's pretty decent though. It's also really cool for Grimm fans. Other people may want to wait for a sale to get it.  Like every game that exists you should go check out longer gameplay videos before buying to see if it appeals to you. That's pretty much a given but I felt I'd mention it anyway. The game is quite beautiful but you should see it in action to help you decide if it's what you want or not.",

            "review_text": "Played Iron Man only. Got to Iceland on my 3rd try. Got 1 shotted. The game's good but it gets old fast. I'm not doing another try - quests are too repetitive! Worth the price tag though, if only for the art.   That being said the game could be renamed: ''Eating &amp; hunting simulator 2016''.  -Pros- -Smooth controls -Amazing art -Music/soundtrack is fitting  -Cons- -Only 4 quest types (find a guy, protect villager(s), gather food, kill x mobs) -You eat non stop. For some reason your guy needs to eat far too much. Food also heals you after your full so you're always in need of more, it never ends. Even if you end up full you'll just get hit by something and have to eat half of your rations to heal up, which in turn means more hunting needed. -Hitboxes are ♥♥♥♥ed up, you can't really dodge everything, especially wolves/boars/witches -Some mobs deal far too much damage (Witches) -Bugs (beastiary, invite feature) -Can't move your food around in your bag, which means you'll always be eating the left most food if you hotkey eat, otherwise you have to open bag and pick the food you want to eat and drag it or double click. That's very annoying considering you eat non-stop. -Weapons are weak for the most part - you get most of em through quests (axes you get through chests) and most are fairly weak at any given time. To kill ♥♥♥♥, you use bombs. (consumables)  Aka: Have food, be full HP, farm bomb mats - repeat  You'll use your weapons to finish stuff off mainly. -Potions are like accessories mainly. Unlike the blacksmith (in which you can swap the gear you've made) if you make a potion it'll override the previous one and it's gone! This is a terrible feature seein as they cost quite a bit to make. -Food recipes are too expensive for the most part, that's unless they nerf hunger. -No bosses ( Think there's only 1 last stage)   TL;DR Game's cheap, worth what it's worth. Quests bland, weapons weak, not too many bugs, bombs rule all, hunger's ridiculous.",
