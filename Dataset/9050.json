A lot of people are complaining about original, because it's too much darker or screen resolutions problem, learn to open settings and set your screen size, BFG dummies. DOOM 3 is very good game, it's designed to be a dark horror survival game,but BFG maked more lighter which is just not fun to be scared. BFG Edition is just full of bugs and it has Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 which are in another words broken games. BFG versions of Ultimate Doom and Doom 2 are just f*****g c**p. Why? Because they censored red crosses of health packs with pills and removed in Doom 2 two Wolfenstein levels: WW2 Nazi soldiers, flags, Hitler portraits,etc. and it reminds like non textured level from Bubsy 3D. When I played Doom 3 BFG Edition at my friend's house, I thought is this another beta versions of all Doom games?! If you wanna get all DOOM games, buy classic complete and Doom 3 pack and stay the F**K out of the BFG Edition. BTW, DOOM 3 BFG EDITION HOW I PLAYED IT I THINK IT IS ONLY FOR GERMANS ( I'm, not against Germans, btw), glitchy and non-scary and censored, because it's designed for them. Nowadays people got so scared on some new games and don't like old scary games to be scared, get real people!",

            "review_text": "***I WROTE THIS REVIEW IN November of 2006... Found it on my HD and reposted it because I felt it still holds up- hope you enjoy it*  To set the record straight, Doom 3 is hardly a sequel in the sense that none of the events of a Mars invaded Hell ever occurred. Think of it as a Doom adaptation. You are a Marine landing on the surface of Mars at a military research base reporting to your officer for orders. When you arrive you find you are to report to a lab to escort a scientist back to the military headquarters. So you grab a weapon and make your way down the dark passages of laboratories where civilian crewmembers are ominously talking about people who have mysteriously disappeared or have heard voices; hinting that something BIG is about to happen. When you finally meet up with the scientist, something goes terribly wrong and the forces of hell are released while demons pass through portals and soldiers are possessed across the red planet. For the next twenty minutes the game unleashes the best scare tactics and sequences of events I have ever experienced in a horror video game. But not only is game brilliant in scaring the crap out of you, the dark facility level design is absolutely perfect. Lights flicker as your fellow marines are screaming over the radio. Muffled sounds of shouts and gunfire on other side of walls or even demonic arms reaching through the walls all cause you to walk through each corridor cautiously with an itchy trigger finger.  Gameplay: Upon your arrival on Mars, you are handed your very own PDA which you use throughout the game to acquire passwords to cabinets, open doors, read scientist's e-mail and voicemail and even watch videos that describe different areas of maps. Reading other scientist's e-mail is important throughout the game for they sometimes describe weakness in enemies and even reveal hidden stashes to ammo and health packs.  So you have your PDA, what else do you need? Oh yeah, a flashlight. A flashlight? Yes a flashlight. To make Doom 3 scarier than it already is, the creators equipped our voiceless, nameless marine with a flashlight to check out those dark scary corners. But the catch is you cannot bear any weapons while you hold your flashlight. This means if there is indeed a zombie lurking in the shadows you better switch to your shotty quick!  The weapons in Doom 3 are almost what you would expect from the original game. You start off with a meager handgun, upgrade to the shotgun, which upgrades to an assault gun, the basic 1, 2, 3 step formula in any FPS. What, you think they're gonna start you off with the BFG? As you progress, you eventually have the entire arsenal from the original Doom plus something special the creators added in the later portions.   About half way through the game, the brilliant scripted sequences start to fade away and Doom 3 becomes more of a repetitive brainless shooter. Demons become less scary (even the newer ones) and you will start to predict where doors will open and how to handle the situations that are supposed to be tough. (that occurs when doors close and you are trapped in a room with 37 demons) What happened to the dazzling writing we saw in the game's opening?  There was also one tribute to Doom the creators added that I absolutely love. Do you remember playing the original Doom, and sometimes when an imp fired one of it's fireballs at you and a possessed marine got in the way, the marine would start attacking the imp? Well I used to see how many enemies I could wake up and just run around the map for 10-15 minutes seeing how many enemies would die without me firing a single shot. Well Doom 3 also kept the same demons fighting demons portion, which made me laugh the first time I saw it. Too bad the maps in Doom 3 aren't square and rectangular like they used to be, it's a lot harder to run away from enemies.  Graphics: I can't begin to express my satisfaction when I double clicked the Doom 3 icon on my desktop and watched the opening cut scene. From that point on the smooth textures and unique dark/bright lighting produces an amazing environment to battle demons. I also loved as you approach a cut scene, the camera pauses as your character continues to walk forward giving you an outer body experience as the cut scene begins. This happens every time a new monster is introduced over the course of the game. The cut scene ends when the camera seamlessly zooms into the back of your characters head, into is current vision. Very well done.  Multiplayer: I know most people are not buying Doom 3 for the multiplayer experience but this is 2006 and games today pretty much come standard with multiplayer options. How many games today have an incredible single player story AND incredible multiplayer gameplay (or modification)? It is obvious Id concentrated entirely on the single player aspect and at the last minute threw in a small multiplayer option where you can join servers that supports up to 4 players. A tribute to old school Doom multiplayer maybe? Back when you had to dial your friend on your 14.4 kbps modem and run around shooting each other? Even if it is, the enjoyment quickly diminishes over time... exponentially! In fact, I can't find a reason to ever play Doom 3 MP again. The dark maps and quick paced gameplay does not translate well into multiplayer gaming even if there are only four players in a server. .  Pros: Corridor shooter with heavy emphasis on unpredicted scares.   Cons: Weak multiplayer, formulaic advance through game, well thought out scares turn into mundane annoyances.  Bottom Line: A dark and morbid FPS like nothing you've ever seen. Interesting story and impressive real time action shots that will make your jaw drop. The Doom 3 engine however has room for improvement in an environment that only works for this genre of gameplay. ",

In college, I had a room mate who was playing the game, when he suddenly jumped up from his keyboard, turned on every light in the room, quit the game, and said 'I'll try again tomorrow.' He scared himself back to childhood!  Doom 3 is one of the greats. It's critically underrated, it can be a ton of fun. Enjoy it!",

DOOM 3 employs more darker levels, horror and fear tactics (enemies popping out from hidden walls or teleporting around you) which works very well. The graphics and attention to detail all look great and the level designs are a lot tighter and have the player traversing through a lot of hallways and corridors. The campaign is ~8-10 hours long so it's a lot longer than most campaigns. During the middle it becomes a little repetitive as you constantly have to find PDAs or some item before you can open a door but then near the end the game really kicks into another gear and ends on a high note. DOOM 3 is a solid FPS shooter that also may have the player jump out of the seat once or twice!",

        {
            "review_text": "If you've ever played Doom, you know it's a fast-paced run and gun shooter. Doom 3 still is, but it is distinctly slower, putting more emphasis on atmosphere instead. The lighting engine was very advanced for the time and it really helps to set the mood when you see huge, menacing shadows fly by the walls cast by demons running through low angle lighting.   That said, the whole game is dark. You get a flashlight, but you have to choose between equipping it or wielding a weapon. That fact has garnered a lot of flak for the game, but I didn't mind it. Forcing you to hold your flashlight at the cost of disarming yourself made simply walking down a corridor feel intense.   The majority of the game takes place in a research facility on Mars, which grants a sense of isolation. You know that you and the few remaining personnel are on your own. Inside this facility, though are a bunch of tight corridors, and that's about it. Again, some people hate that, but to me claustrophobia is another plus factor to the atmosphere. The game is meant to be intense, even when nothing is going on, and the feeling of being trapped does just that.  With the exception of reloading, the gunplay feels classic. You have to put a bunch of rounds into the enemies to kill them, and some of the larger enemies will require multiple reloads with smaller weapons. Circle strafing is a must in larger areas, but you'll have to do a lot of popping in and out of cover or tactically charge or retreat in most cases. It has the same sort of feel as Doom, just a bit modernized (for 2004) and stylized.  The game has a few flaws, though, but they can mostly just be ignored. The AI is a little lackluster at times. There are small closet-sized rooms which serve simply to open silently behind you and release an enemy. The darkness might strain your eyes a bit, so playing for a couple hours might be a bit uncomfortable. To some, the gameplay might get repetitive. But for me, the strengths far outweighed these few weaknesses. This is definitely a recommend.",

            "review_text": "Though my play time says I've only played this for fifteen minutes, rest assured, I played and completed this entire game. It took me many years to work my way through Doom 3, on multiple copies of the game.  Doom 3 is a game that wants to be many things. It is good at basically none of them. Many of the things it wants to be contradict each other. It wants to be scary, but it also wants to be macho action. It wants to be Half-Life (and specifically Half-Life), but it also wants to stay Doom.   It is neither scary nor action-packed, its story doesn't make any sense, and its villain doesn't actually state any real intended motive. Demons arrive on Mars with the help of Dr. Betruger and want to use space ships to travel to earth. Think about that for a moment: demons have to use our space ships to reach earth. When the first 15 or 20 demons get to earth, what do they think will happen when they get there? Do they think they'll just order another shipment of demons from Mars until, 20 demons at a time, they've conquered the entire planet, unopposed?  And why does Betruger want to help the demons reach earth? He just does, because that's all the reason anyone needs, apparently.  The real heart of the problem is the gameplay. Flashlight issues aside, gun play is slow and clumsy. Weapons take forever to reload, and once you start reloading your gun, you can't switch to something else. Often I'd get in to scenarios where I'd empty the clip in one gun, try to switch to something else, and have to wait for my character to spend 6 seconds slowly reloading his shotgun first. This feels like a horror game mechanic designed to make you panic, but it most frequently happened to me during a part of the game where it's trying to ramp up the action. It just doesn't mesh. Getting cornered by 5 monsters in a tight space unable to use any guns because you're accidentally stuck in a reload animation sucks.  And then there's the ending, with one of the most limp final bosses I've ever encountered and a crummy cliffhanger to set up the expansion pack, Resurrection of Evil.  I knew going in that people didn't like Doom 3, but I wasn't prepared just for how bad it actually was. Curiosity killed the Cacodemon.",

So what can I say about Doom that hasn't already been said its gory, its bloody and just outright brutal but this game took it up a notch. You play as an unamed space marine stationed on Mars City run by the UAC (Union Aerospace Corporation) you happened to arrive on the same day something extraordinary happens where scientists decide to open a portal to hell but didn't think to shut it for some daft reason and it all goes to hell literally because lost souls, imps anything evil and nasty has come out to play with your body being their toy. This game happens to take a more survival horror approach with limited ammo, non-regenerative health and satan wanting to play a few too many pranks on you in many rooms and it works for the amount of time I have played this game which I mainly played it on the original Xbox I was really petrified and even more frightend on PC.

But even as a young lad back in the early 2000s this game was way too boring for me. The combat itself fell incredibly flat even compared to the original Doom games. Enemy bodies disappear before they even hit the ground. The guns sound like ♥♥♥♥. The level design may have gone over well in the mid to late 90s but by the time this game came out it felt anachronistically bland - basically just long metal corridor after long metal corridor. Say what you want about Halo 1's level design, at least you'd go outside and have a change of scenery every once in a while. In this game, all you do is plod around and shoot at enemies with your clunky Mattel toy gun and watch as the enemies disappear before you have a chance to see the ragdoll physics, set in a universe where light only comes in two forms - brighter than the sun or darker than space. I suspect alot of people are projecting their love of the series as a whole onto this game individually when they praise it.",

Ironically it seemed like Id software didn't understand their own creation as well as the members of the audience did, and it showd, it showd in the reviews, in the general opinion and view that people get even now while talking about it, it wasn't a bad game, it was just a dissapointing one, people generally espected a game where you felt like a soldeir of fortune, fighting your way through the runes of hell, ripping demons appart as others tried to reach and tear you apart, it was a wonderful reality but sadly it wasn't the real one.  The game fails to reach several different of it's own ambitions, it doesn't know what it wants to be, instead it always bounces back and foward creating a circle of apathy for itself, often times it tries to genuinely scare you while other times it tries to recreate that same dream that we all had. It's clear that there were problems in the beginning of the development of the game, the team probrably didn't knew very well what they were trying to do and it ended up turning against them. It's sad to see one of my favorite games shred into an uncanny delusion of horror and madness, but it was probrably something that i should have seen coming since the day it was announced, i just hope the next one won't fail to achieve the old natural formula that i miss so much, but as for now i will go back playing through 'The Shores of Hell'.",

            "review_text": "Without a doubt in my mind the best Doom game ever released. Doom 3 elevated the formula established by the original games and added punchier combat, the ability to look up and, of course, all out intensity. It's horror elements are, granted, fairly rudimentary, resorting to a (quite large) abundance of jump scares and spawning multiple enemies in tight spaces so that you aren't always prepared to attack. These actually get quite tedious after a while and you also start to expect them more as you move through the game.   Doom 3 handles intensity, however, like a professional and delivers a masterclass of suspense-filled FPS action. Importantly, it creates a sense of vulnerability in the player, despite arming them with all the original games' weapon arsenal; you often fight in the dark, against multiple adversaries and, without your flashlight, you'll often fire blindly at walls as the targets scurry off into the shadows. The flashlight taking up a weapon slot was honestly a great idea. I have no idea why people wanted to change this, as it was a fundamental part of what made Doom 3 such an uneasy and suspenseful experience.  For all it's gameplay strengths, the Doom 3 story is still worth mentioning. It's not amazing, and has a particularly gaping plothole revolving around a certain principal character, but is functional and enjoyable enough to provide enough impetus to slug through the dark demon-infested space complex. As with most FPSs, the boss battles are relatively weak affairs but even after 12 years, their designs have the power to creep you out.   I loved Doom 3 due to it's impact in making players view the Doom franchise differently. It built upon the original games' love of trapping you in a room full of weaponry and armour but spawning half a hundred demons, made it darker and spookier (and also more claustrophobic) but kept the running+gunning gameplay and weapon variety intact so that the essence of the originals wasn't totally lost. This new direction for Doom I welcomed and hoped the new 2016 game would follow, though unfortunately that is not the case.  This is a game that is certainly worth picking up and adding to your collection; although it's relatively old, it achieves both encumbering atmosphere and suspense, while retaining the staple 'balls to the wall' combat of the originals. It is different in enough ways that evolves the formula of the original games, yet familiar enough so as not to harm the series' character and established gameplay elements. Highly recommended.  9/10",

Regardless of this fact, despite being a 'negative review' you should judge my review on the basis of being a   Doom   game not a standalone or a spin-off. Basically put, as any FPS it's good but as Doom it's poor.  It considerably lacks the movement speed seen in Doom 1 and 2 with Run enabled, the game takes place mainly indoors and on Mars, not once allowing the player to experience the same level of immersion given to Doom 2 until you reach Hell. Quite lacking in the department of edge that gave the game that level of 'You're in Hell forever' and it's metalhead atmosphere, felt far more scripted and bit too grimdark for my tastes.   Felt more like playing System Shock with Doom Weapons but without the same level of depth as System Shock or Doom itself. It feels like the ID team were attempting to make an intelligent shooter but lacked either development time to implement them.  As a standalone, the sequel to ID's famed shooter, DooM. The IDTech engine has been upgraded graphically supporting some very impressive visuals for it's time and sikkmod immeasurably improves the visuals to such a photorealistic degree, it's quite revolutionary. Doom 3 does improve greatly on the survival horror aspect of the genre through directed narrative of a teleportation technology gone terribly wrong (prepare for foreseen consequences), lacking significant ammo for weapons, using sound effects in the dark to ominously warn players and using darkness as a way to surprise the players and the generally satisfactory level design and great lighting help aid it.   Expect to cack your pants often from a Demon Imp coming out of no where and scratching you to bits if you do purchase it.",

But this game gave me the same rush of horror and suspense as Alien: Isolation, which came out 2 years ago.  DOOM 3 is by far one of the scariest games I've ever played. I've played almost all of the FNaF games, and they mainly use jumpscares of things literally jumping out in your face, and I would say it is a cheap way of scaring you. DOOM 3 uses things like suspense and things popping out not in your face, but just popping out of somewhere you didn't expect or couldn't see. For example, something that runs really fast might start running at you out of the darkness, where you can't see them beforehand and it catches you off-guard. One of the scariest enemies in the game is the simple infected human because of the awful groaning they make as they, ever so slowly, make their way to you, and you can't see them in the dark without your flashlight, so you might not know when they will strike, and it's truly horrifying.  Apart from the horror, this game is also a great shooter. There are many weapons that you will use at least once, even the pistol. They all have their advantages and disadvantages, so there is no perfect weapon. There are boss fights, shootouts, demon summonings, hordes, and just plain enemies around the station. Overall, DOOM 3 is the perfect combo of shooter and true horror.  There should have been a horror game category in the Steam Awards, because if there was, this should win it.",

This game is, for me, an excellent merging of Horror Movie and RPG.   As usual, you have your God Mode cheats and such, gamers such as myself that aren't adept at Shooters may need to rely on them sooner than a gamer more skilled at a Shooter would, but any shame you might feel at needing them is nothing to immersive world that this DOOM installment offers or the extra tidbits like listening to audio recordings or reading emails on the PDAs that are essential to your progress through each of the levels.
