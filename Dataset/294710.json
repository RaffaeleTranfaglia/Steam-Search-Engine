            "review_text": "Honest Review for Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick:  This is a game I have recommended to all of my friends who I know, in fact i bought it for one of them. Who knew such a simplistic game could have such an impact on anybodys life. I think that all of the Putt-Putt games are a work of art, but Putt-Putt® and Pep's Dog on a Stick is the Mona Lisa of the Putt-Putt Series. The Gameplay is amazing and the how the characters act and talk make me feel like I am actually in the Game. Putt-Putt is such an engrossing character you cannot even begin to comprehend how much I love that car. If I had a choice between a Ferrari 458 and Putt-Putt as my first car, I would choose Putt-Putt.  This game has brought more joy to my life than you would ever know. Just Seeing Pep collecting those bones and getting to the checkered flag brings so much happiness and joy to my life. This game is a force to be reckoned with. If you have the money, buy this game, if you have more, buy the Complete Pack, I love these games. As DJ Khaled Said: ''Another One'' that is how i feel when I get money in my steam account, I will just buy another Putt-Putt game, another one, Another One, Until I have the Whole Franchise.  I suggest this game for everyone!",
