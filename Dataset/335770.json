            "review_text": "After playing this for a few hours, I've come to the conclusion that this game is sadly not worth a person's time. There's some genuine desire to make a game that's an homage to the Ultima Online style of gameplay and I can't help but admire that. Unfortunately, there's a lot of laziness going on here.  Let's talk about the elephant in the room here. That this is an RPGMaker game isn't a bad thing, but usage of stock sprites, sound effects, and music is always something that can and should knock points off. Pushing that aside, an RPGMaker game can still succeed well in spite of this by focusing on the gameplay. Here, Tkl starts off alright. The game's a little rough around the edges for the first hour, but enjoyable. You're getting loot from monsters and chests, exploring, learning new skills, all that good stuff. Then you clear the first dungeon.  Then the trouble starts. Exploring the world is something anyone does in these sorts of games, but when you do find civilizations away from Orbis? Half the doors don't work. No, that doesn't mean that there's nothing there. What it means is when you try to exit these doors from the inside, you fail to area transition. The game still thinks you're outside while you're stuck inside and then the game hangs. No save, no load, no quitting save for alt+f4. Given that you buy upgrades and reagents to progress, this isn't a small issue. This is a big issue.  Suppose you decide to forego this and grab treasure from chests? 75% of the chests in the world don't work. You'll open it, the game will play a tune and go 'You got an item!' and then... nothing. You get NOTHING! This is such a glaring flaw in a game that's emulating UO, especially how gear-driven this game is. With all the time saved by not having to worry about creating your own sprite sheets, one would think populating the chests in the game would be important to reward exploration.  Please show your games you make more love, as dedicating this game to the fans of T2A has got to be one of the biggest insults any UO player has ever had to endure.",
