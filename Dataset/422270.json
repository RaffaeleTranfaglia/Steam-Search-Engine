            "review_text": "Summary: This game is quite the bore, and quite horribly designed all around.  Tutorial --- The tutorial left much to be desired. It doesn't show you anything, it just gives you a description of what to click, and it's only about 15 messages or so long. The content itself doesn't actually describe what you need to do in order to get started in the game - it just gives you some basic information and tells you some things you need to click on.  After going through the tutorial, I was incredibly confused on what I even needed to do next. The messages lacked detail and I missed some very basic things (like auto-completing the building or *moving* the building to a different location on the screen). Then I sat there and wondered how I actually got people to come live there, as several of my homes had completed already but it still said I had no Free Homes. Eventually it just updated on its own, I have no real idea what caused it to do that though.  Controls --- Terrible. You can only move around the map by moving your mouse to the edges of the screen, at least from what I can tell. I wouldn't be able to confirm because there is no actual Options menu which lists out controls, so I'm assuming you can only use your mouse for anything. I would have expected the minimalistic idea of using the arrow keys to move around easier, because using the mouse at the edge can be quite glitchy, and is pretty terrible in this game.  The clicking action is also horribly bound. Clicking on something will click on *every single thing* under your cursor. This gets especially annoying when there are any messages on the screen, or if you're trying to click on something that is below one of the buttons on the right - it will activate both things you clicked on. The mapping for the buttons seems to be off too, as there have been many times where I've clicked something on the map that was just near one of the buttons on the right, but it still activated the button.  Even worse, if you want to start over fresh to see if you can manage things better this time around - too bad, you can't. There is no restart feature. Once you've started, you keep that forever. As far as I can tell, all of the information for your city is stored on their servers, not on your computer, so you can't do squat.  Countdowns --- The entire game is based on countdown timers for how long it will take for a building to complete or how long it will take for a new resource to appear. It's really quite boring, and all you can do is just sit there and wait. You can instantly complete your building if you have coins to do that, but if you run out you're boned.  Resources --- The resource system is possibly the most annoying part of this game. They make it incredibly easy to get all the coins you could possibly need by building shops, but they limit you to only 5 of each type of resource miner, and some of them barely pump out squat. Nowhere near enough to keep up a steady building pace. I had all five brick builders constructed and I was still having to sit around and wait for more because even with all five, you still only get enough bricks each round to construct one, maybe two more buildings.  Further, I'm pretty sure the stone mining building is completely glitched. It keeps adding a bunch of squares where it looks like it's generating more stone, but near the end doesn't complete the task and just stops doing anything. I had to keep moving my brick buildings around to new spots of stone because the stone mining wasn't actually producing more stone for those buildings. Maybe I was doing something wrong. Maybe that was something that needed included in that crappy tutorial I mentioned.  Advertised Game Features --- The description of this game is quite hilarious if you've actually been into the game to see how it works. Mainly, the list of 'features' that this game has.  - High quality building graphics -- I wouldn't call any of them high quality. They look ok, but they're extremely basic and nothing to be excited about. There's also a lot of anti-aliasing issues that make some spots look pretty bad. - More than 80 different types of buildings -- Most of which are the same. There are several different types of Apartments that all look similar, several Condos that all look similar, and several Row Houses that all look similar. You get the idea. There's a lot of different types of the *same thing* that are slightly modified to look different. - Changing vehicle traffic on the roads, animated cars and buses -- There's traffic, that drives around pretty randomly and doesn't really add anything to the game whatsoever. Might as well not even be there. - A unique road construction system -- Nothing unique about it. It's an incredibly standard 'put a piece of road on the squares and they connect together' road system with no curves and no creativity to it. - Fun game play in a unique tycoon game -- Fun is quite the overstatement. As is unique. - City builder game for all ages -- Maybe elementary school students. - Be a city building tycoon -- Were they just trying to make their description longer by adding bullet points? - Artificial intelligence based on real simulation of in and out moving tenants -- None witnessed. It's just numbers that represent your population and then a couple of bars that represent the number of free homes and jobs. I'm not sure they know what AI means. - Unexpected catastrophe simulations -- Never tried this because, well, why would you? It takes freaking forever to build anything up in this game, why would I want to destroy it all in a few moments? - Travis the city adviser will give you hints -- He's about as useful as the Microsoft paper clip. - Continuous updates and bug fixes -- Oh boy, I sure hope so.  --- ---  They should have spent quite a bit more time on this game making sure it was actually ready and would be fun. Spelling mistakes in your text is a HUGE no-no. I mean, come on, really? That's so damn easy to catch. Hopefully this game gets a *lot* of improvements to make it more fun and live up to its description. But right now, it's not worth the $3 I paid for it.",

As someone pointed out it does have a bit of a mobile feel to it and in my case it was very welcomed because this game fits the 'sit back and relax' type of genre. And hey! it costs less than 4€.",
