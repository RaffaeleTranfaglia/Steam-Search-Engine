But this one, I did. It was kinda like a good book or a thrilling movie. I just kept going and going excited to find out what's gonna happen next.  Well, at first I was like 'meh, it's 2015. Do I really want to buy something that looks like it could be made by Lucas Arts in the 80's?' Let me tell you, I am glad I did. Once you start playing the game, it simply captures your imagination. Writing and pacing are superb and neither story nor dialogues ever get boring. Characters are interesting and entertaining. The voice acting fits perfectly. This might just be one - if not THE - best game I have played in a couple of years! HD graphics? Never while playing this game did I feel the need for that.  Please, let there be a sequel.",

            "review_text": "If you are a fan of point and click games, dystopian fiction and/or cyberpunk, then forget the rest of the review and just buy the game. Technobabylon has the quality that is to be expected of Wadjet Eye Games and is perhaps a contender for their best game at the time of writing.   Technobabylon takes place in a dystopian future where genetic engineering is common and many people use 'Trance' instead of interacting with other people normally. An AI named Central powers the city and the CEL police keep tabs on just about everyone and everything. As usual with Wadjet Eye Games, the story is high quality and I do seriously hope it continues in a future sequel.  Developer Technocrat has pushed the somewhat divisive AGS engine further than I thought it could go; there are many sections involving people connecting to electronic devices and some of the best puzzles take place in this state. Whether it is just using these devices to obtain download attachments or solving far more complex puzzles, Technobabylon stands out when compared to adventure games using simpler mechanics. I wasn't expecting some of the puzzles and a few genuinely had me stumped for a while. So unlike many adventure games, this isn't just a great story based experience, there's challenge here and it's more challenging than most Wadjet Eye Games.  Wadjet Eye Games enjoy giving you control over numerous characters and I found that this could lead to some confusion as how to progress. I liked that this game rarely had any of these moments and when you were able to switch between characters, it would always be in aid of solving a puzzle together. It's these design choices that make Technobabylon a bit easier to swallow than a game like Resonance.  There's not a lot else to say, if you are really into Wadjet Eye Games, then you will already have your eye on this. Fans of Gemini Rue, Shardlight and Resonance will eat this up. A polished point and click game in that old-school style and a creative science fiction story that deserves some sequels.",

Played every single one of them and can't stop beeing surprised by the stories, the high-quality development and the small details in gameplay, which make every game unique.  Technobabylon offers a great cyber-punk story about 2080s, Trance aka 'The new internet', the idea of a humane AI keeping order in the city, cloning humans for food in luxurious restaurants, the price of groundbreaking research and sacrifices a man of future may stumble upon. It's very detailed and all the additional info is very interesting to read.  In terms of gameplay this game has some variety of choices to make and a bunch of different ways to achieve something you need. None of them left me saying 'that's irrational/illogical', so everything can be done without looking into the walkthrough, which is a feature of a nicely elaborated quest. I would totally recomend buying it. - Wadjet eye games fan",

            "review_text": "Traditional pointn'click still has its charm, when it comes with a well-developed story and interesting, well-integrated puzzles. Wadjet Eye's releases have proven that point time and again. Luckily, Technobabylon is no exception. It is not the first dystopia in the publisher's books (that would be Gemini Rue, and later they have released the post-apocalyptic Primordia), but it might very well be their best one. The technosceptical story builds a world that at its best moments is at par with William Gibson's Neuromancer and treads similar grounds concerning AIs, digital life, life in the digital and autoritarian societies. And yet, all this heady social critique does not become moralizing grouchiness. The multi-plot narration - done with very competent voice-acting for all dialogue- keeps players engaged with interesting, deep characters and some nicely staged twists (though admittedly some are not as twisty as the writers obviously thought them to be). The puzzles are exceptionally well done, notwithstanding one or two lesser specimen. No spoilers here, but should you get stuck in a kitchen, you'll know what I mean. But all of them are fitting with the characters and the plot; there is nothing haphazardly glued into the game to bolster playtime, no lazy logic puzzles, not much walking around and no backtracking. Top notch design! I only played it a year after release, but I have to say that all the laurels Technobabylon gathered in 2015 were well-earned. Definitively one of the best adventure games 2015/16!",

This bugged me a lot.   I did not like some of the puzzles either, as they were less about brainstorming and more about randomly using certain items on things until you got it. I also hate pixel hunting which game got in a few places where I got stuck and had to look up how to get past.  I also found the acting a bit jarring at times but it seems to be all over the place. For this, it has some charm that I like.  Like I said, the story is fantastic and I would much rather have read a book about the story than dealing with some of the pixel hunting and 'try all the items until it works.' puzzles.",

Every relevant piece of information was sufficiently developed &amp; clarified throughout the whole game.  Even though there were quite a bit of technical terms implemented in this game (which sometimes felt like I was learning a new language) I most definitely enjoyed the game! I found it very interesting &amp; exciting!  The puzzles were of a satisfying difficulty. There was a good balance of 'flow' &amp; 'resistance' in regard to game progression (for me, personally).  What I mean by this is that puzzle difficulty allowed for smoother progression at some times, and at other times I felt I was required to think a bit harder before I could proceed (without doing my head in though).  So I was very pleasantly surprised by how the developer team pulled this off!   I figured out most on my own, but did need to cheat about 2 times (hey!, that's not too bad!).  This game contains different fun elements: - beautiful character design &amp; environment + fitting music - natural voice acting (although the way it was scripted made some reactions seem over-the-top) - well written dialogue (made sense) - multiple &amp; meaningful character introductions - intuitive &amp; original puzzles (with some exceptions, but definitely doable) - flashbacks - choice &amp; consequence - virtual reality &amp; AI theme - ethnical diversity - taboo &amp; shocking details  There's a total of 3 main characters (which are each playable at some point, and even interchangeably so near the end, so as to have them act as a team - very fun!).  Just wished they had implemented that possibility sooner!  I pretty much loved everything about this game :). I could see myself replaying it over &amp; over again in a couple of years from now!  This game gave me the chills (in a good way), the way Blade Runner did back in the day! It's so refreshing &amp; different!  I'm hoping there will be a sequel to this! There has to be! The ending (as is) is acceptable, though I'd love to see more :)!  So worth the price!",

The game pulls you into a great story through strong and relatable characters with clear motivations that you can get behind. It dangles the mystery like a carrot on a stick, but gives you enough payoffs to keep you going. The real star, however, is the amazing sense of world-building and atmosphere. Technobabylon builds an incredibly believable world that builds off of our current technological and societal trajectory and takes it in some very scary directions. Its atmosphere and soundtrack are also wonderful, creating a completely cohesive and immersive world.  The interactions between the characters are well done, and there are some standout supporting characters that are a real hoot. The dialogue can get VERY expositional at times, especially when the plot twists start cropping up near the end, but overall the dialogue is very snappy and well done.  The gameplay is solid, using great puzzles and exploration that make sense but are still challenging. It doesn't fall into the normal nonsensical adventure game puzzle tropes, which I'm very thankful for. You can usually piece together what you need to do from your surroundings and resources, but you still feel smart for figuring it out. There are a couple of times when what you're supposed to be doing isn't made clear (as in, what your objective is or why you're somewhere in the first place), but these points were few and far between.  I picked this game up, and couldn't put it down until 9 hours later. It is a fantastic adventure game and I give it a wholehearted recommendation to any fan of of the genre.",

            "review_text": "Excellent game, I bought it at full price and I'm glad I did because the devs deserve it. Easily amongst the best modern point-and-clicks I've played, and good enough to hold its own with the classics too. Its engaging story is bolstered by stellar worldbuilding that strikes the perfect balance between drowning the player in backstory vs giving them nothing outisde the main narrative. You get to delve deep into many aspects of the dystopian cyberpunk future that the game weaves around you, but there are plenty of things that are only mentioned or implied. This dichotomy makes the game/world feel much larger than it actually is, which is a rare trick in this age of exposition heavy Wiki-oriented games. The end result of the narrative and worldbuilding is a game that you won't want to stop playing, and I was a little sad when I completed it just because I knew that was all I'd get to see of this world.  That said, it does have the same flaws as many other games of its type. Sometimes you won't be able to parse what the designer expects you to do next. Other times you'll overlook an interactable object and spend a good 15 minutes furiously trying everything in your inventory on all the interactable points until you realize you missed something. You'll be able to get hints from NPCs to help you past some of these issues, but they're still present and can be annoying when trying to complete the game without a walkthrough. I think it's worth noting that the hints were never immersion-breaking; the NPCs' advice always seemed to fit their characters and the situation at hand, rather than breaking the fourth wall and condescending to the player by practically telling them the solution.  All in all, this is a must-have for anyone who loves point-and-click or cyberpunk. If you like both then scroll up, click 'Add to Cart,' and free up the next 8-10 hours to be swept away by this masterpiece.  Disclaimer: I did not receive this game for free, nor do I have any relationship to anyone involved with the game. I do, however, have a raging nerd-on for cyberpunk settings.",

            "review_text": " Technobabylon  is an excellent addition to publisher Wadjet Eye's ever-growing catalog of gorgeously lo-fi adventures. The most striking thing about the game is that it does a far better job at building a fascinating science fiction world than most AAA productions; in this aspect it more closely approaches a good novel than a game, bringing to mind great cyberpunk authors like Rudy Rucker or William Gibson, while at the same time maintaining its own creative identity. Food, sports, cyberspace and IRL addictions, crime, criminal justice, politics -- it's all handled in an unobtrusive and intriguing way that draws the player deeply in. The puzzles, which are all of about medium difficulty, all make sense in the context of this world and its tech, coming across more as outgrowth than obligatory tack-on. It would be a shame for Technocrat's painstakingly crafted milieu to go to waste, and fortunately, there are indications, both in  Technobabylon 's narrative and in the developer commentary, that a sequel may be in the works.    There are a few questions that I would like answered about the mostly *very* impressive story (especially the import of a certain apartment bombing) but these gaps don't trip up the plot for me in the least; some of these can be left for the sequel I suppose, while the remainder can be left to player interpretation without strain on narrative continuity. The voice acting, as in all Wadjet Eye productions, varies from actor to actor. It is never bad, but never perfectly professional; it puts me in the mind of an obviously talented community theater troupe rather than a stable of career voice actors, and actually intensifies the hip 'indie' vibe of the whole production. I did encounter one minor bug in the game -- a wrench that I could not yank out of a gear because a partition blocked its hotspot -- but it only set me back about about a minute of playtime.  (There were many awesomely odd little incidents that really helped me suspend my disbelief. For example: in a scummy VR-hosting dive, the player character must pry off a layer of crusted old wetware -- signal-broadcasting, nanomachine-rich goop that people smear on devices to interface their own internal wiring to those systems -- before she can apply her own and access a machine. It's visceral details like this that make all the difference!)",

Then, I spent about an hour and a half trying to finish the last chapter, but it just didn't work.   I put the grenade in the drone and tried both ways; I sent it toward the power supply - machinery ate the drone. I sent it underneath towards the Mindjacker - machinery still ate the drone. I tried it multiple times with a little variation. I put the grenade in with each different character - even Latha. Never worked.

The story is well thought out and brilliant, and the voice acting consistantly excellent. The atmosphere is wonderful   The game is pretty story heavy, and I would have liked more and more diverse puzzles. The art style is one that people will either love or hate. Personally, I liked the pixel art style, and found it really worked with the atmosphere of the game, but others might not find it as impressive.   Overall, I found it a great game with well written characters, wonderful voice acting, good and consistant atmosphere, and a great story. Would recommend!",

If you are a fan of this genre, then this is a definite worth-while pick-up. Major strengths are the writing &amp; plot and a good balance of difficulty. Weaknesses are a lack of variety in puzzle type (a few too many based on 'hard to spot object) and not getting to use all main characters in the game at once until the last chapter.   On the while, I definitely enjoyed it for the low price I paid (under $5.00). If you like this type of game or think you'd be interested in trying it, it's a good buy.",
