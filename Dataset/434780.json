            "review_text": "During the recent years, there has been an influx of indie games like never before, and its rare to find something that you can just jump into and don't have to remember where you left off.  Pros: - Its a fun game which anyone can play at anytime, and on any PC as its not demanding at all. - Reminds you of old school dungeon games a bit, and for the older audience of steam (like me), it will bring back a lot of memories. - Doesn't looks half bad and you can really loose yourself in it.  Would have been MUCH more fun with a co-op option, as doing anything with a friend is enjoyable, and this is the kind of game usually does it.  Cons:  - Controls though, are NOT easy to remember. Takes a good lil while to get used to them.  This is not the kind of game you put a lot of thought into buying, so i'm going to keep this short.  Buy it, its nothing complicated or immersive, but its just a plain old fun time. Play this to take a break from your usual AAA titles. Well worth the very moderate price tag.",
