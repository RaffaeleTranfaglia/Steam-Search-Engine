I mean it has those nice graphics and loads of weapon skins, but hey we all have an opinion right?",

VOLVO is so affraid ppl will play it again [css $20 | csgo $15]. What can I say but a big bloody L O L  Guys seriously, this game is better then csgo, headshotting feels good actually in this game and it is more fun. It is more comic-like game, retro...decent graphics and great gameplay, also communities are relaxed...in csgo everyhting is so serious like omfg i deranked, who cares...it is just a videogame and should be played for fun. Thats why i stick with css, no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥et, i dont spend money on skins...i install them for free from  gamebanana.com . More over half of the csgo skins are just same thing different colors...in css you have different rifles and 1000s of skins that are custom made and each unique in its own way. Not to say that 60% csgo community servers are cancerous/racist places where you dont make any friends, only butthurt players that spent all their money on gambling skins and feel frustrated....in css you make lots of friends and you actually have fun.  If you search good place to play css, check out my servers,  www.awpclan.com  we kick azz ;)",

This was my first game into the legendary Counter-Strike series.  Pros: +ADDICTING Gameplay - This is what makes all CS games so fun. From the pluse pounding seconds of defusing a bomb with Terrorists hot on your tail, or the intensity of being the last man standing outnumbered by the opposite team where every move you make will determine whether you will clutch or be kicked. +Well Balanced guns - All the guns in this game are well balanced. Guns like the AWP or DEagle give you power but reduce your speed or mag size. All guns are good, you just need to master them +Fun Maps - All the maps in CS are fun. All maps are well balanced and don't really give one team an advantage over the other.  +Community Maps - The Community maps are easy to access and a lot of fun.  Cons: -...  Overall, (10/10) CS: Source is a really fun game. This game will give you endless hours of fun, love, pain, and glory. Also, the game runs smoothly on my PC. If your PC can't run CS GO, then this is a great alternative.",

Buying weapons very easy to do unlike CSGO where you have this pizza wheel and your re-buy gets deleted but that's a whole other review.  Re-buying weapons is easy.  If you are new I do recommend playing versus bots because it takes skill, paying attention to radar and sound is a big thing in this game, if you do not you are sure to be dead.  Weapons are balanced, people complain about the P90 a lot though if it had 30 rounds it still would be rockin.  Maps are nice, people make maps and mods its a big community thing and I do recommend this game 100%  Fun for all. Just stay away from the christian server and TrueGrit, they get sore about anything you say and that ruins the experience.",

            "review_text": "Whoo, CSS, my favorite of the series. I'll have to say, its gunplay is probably the best out of them. I know, I know, to some, it might feel like its too easy. But no, I think you still have to worry about recoil and such. Plus its just Counter-Strike with the Source engine, the only difference is that some maps from 1.6 didn't make it in and there are some new maps (that also happen to have not been carried over to GO.) Both the new ones and the old ones have great map design, however. Bot AI is alright. They're still kinda stupid even in Hard but I can't complain too much since I'm pretty sure the AI was carried over from CZ (Condition Zero). What makes them harder is their boosted reaction times, weapon preferences, etc. Speaking of bots, if you want to play with human players, there's no such thing as matchmaking or whatever, just a server browser which makes things...quite hard. Why? Oh, I dunno, could be UT2k4 sounds that are so repetitive that could stop you from playing on that server. Or maybe the fact that a server has 16k dollars whenever anyone spawns regardless of how many wins and losses. Basically, there is no tag for avoiding 'community' servers. Which is exactly why I don't play this game online much. Also because literally every brazilian player is some kind of insane pro that once he snags an M4 or AK you're pretty much screwed. Sound design...eh...I mean, most of it was carried over from 1.6 and for its time, 1.6's sound design was actually pretty good. In 2004?...Not so much. I mean, it's still well-designed for detecting enemies and the like, but I mean the quality of the sounds. It all feels like someone just edited stock sounds to make it playable. I'm probably wrong on that matter, maybe, but looking back, it feels a lot that way. The design for the weapons, the least important thing ever, since you can also just download a skin that at least makes it look better...For a Source remake, I'm actually impressed they managed to make the guns look like their real life selves in 2004! But if you're unhappy you can just do what I said above. Reloading animations are so wrong, though. Like pulling the bolt catch on the M4. That's just silly. Then again the animation was from the original CS and back then Valve didn't actually own the franchise. Ah, well. Skins also fix that. Hitboxes are actually spot-on, unlike GO. You have an AK and your crosshair's on someone's head. What happens? Exactly. That's why I love this game so much. I never complained about not having dealt enough damage, because I always did deal damage. Gameplay is balanced since its all carried over from 1.6. I won't cover the radio chatter since that's more for practical reasons rather than flavor. If you're wondering why the voice acting on them's so lame, it's exactly because it's one of the higher staff from the original CS dev team doing the acting. I'm also not going to criticize weapons I dislike despite them having a place in the game like everyone else. I hate the P90 and how overused it is, but if its in the game, its in the game. All of the weapons have their strengths and weaknesses, but the assault rifles by far have it all perfect, since, they don't have weaknesses and they're capable of doing what other weapons specialize in, best. Speaking of assault rifles, the 3-round burst is overpowered but I love it because of just that. It has pinpoint accuracy when firing, unlike 1.6 or literally every CS title as of yet, and it makes the AK seem like a donkey to use when you have the FAMAS' burst on someone's head. Literally 2 shots on one's head to get a headshot if they're wearing a helmet. You don't have to worry about the FAMAS missing one of those shots. The glock gets the same burst but it's not as effective, granted, as it is a starting pistol and doesn't have much in the way of armor penetration. Maybe for balance it breaks it a little what with the CTs having a much better cheap AR in comparison to the T's Galil. Oh well! People seem to enjoy buying deagles instead...I don't blame them. I think that's it. I hope I covered everything someone would need before purchasing this game. In my opinion, it is the best CS title as of yet. The only problem I have, personally, is the fact it lacks a filter for, well...filtering OUT the community servers. But if that's not a problem to you, you should totally get this one. If it is, well...you're probably better off getting GO. 1.6 is essentially the same as Source though, uses a server browser, too. Doesn't even have Source's Tags feature, either. Have fun playing it if ya do get it! :D",

CSS hammers in the mentality that skill will overcome luck and that's why it is so hard to switch from COD of BF because you can body shot all you want you can still get lots of kills, i'm not saying they don't require skill just they don't force you to use skill to get kills. This game combines competitive high speed action with strategic skill and i find it to be quite satisfying. This game can easily absorb so many hours from your life it isn't funny.

The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round on most servers. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay. Shooting while moving dramatically decreases accuracy, and holding the trigger down to continuously shoot produces severe recoil.

            "review_text": "Counter Strike: Source is the most time consuming game I've ever played. Despite that I never really played it seriously with the aim to play competitive in tournaments, I was more a fun gamer who would play for fun with a few friends on public servers and play various different gamemodes. Since there aren't any official tournaments for CS:S anymore, playing it for that aspect will not be possible anymore. The only thing you could do if you want to intensively play competitive is play in leagues in the ESEA or ESL. Players wanting to play in a team in a tournament one day should obviously get CS:GO and play that instead of CS:S. But despite that there is not a huge competitive scene anymore this game can still be lots of fun. But in my opinion the fun is only limited to the various gamemodes which are modded into the game like Zombiemod, Gungame, Bunnyhopping and a lot more which are too much to list. Some of them still include the original type of gameplay while others are completely different and can bring you a whole new experience. But it would be too nice if there would be nothing you can complain about, right? In this case it is the cheaters situation. When you casually play on public servers you will encounter so many cheaters that it is actually unplayable. Because of that there is less room to practice and you will get bored of the game really fast, because who likes to play against cheaters? The sad thing about this is that the majority of the cheaters most likely won't get banned at all by Valves official anti-cheat, and even if they do, they will just get the game again on a new account when it is on sale for small money. Overall I do recommend this game, but only for people who want to play this game for fun and are not trying to get especially good in it or so. The various different gamemodes you can try out were the reason why this game was so addictive for a long time, and I would definitely recommend to try a few out.    ",

There's a reason for its popularity and its gushing reviews. Everything about the game is simply very well-executed. It looks attractive while being easy on system requirements, matches are intense and give great shooting action, and the game is so well polished at this point that (as far as I am aware) there simply are no bugs. It comes with plenty of content to keep you playing for quite a while, and even decent bots for people who want to practice offline or just prefer them.  I do, however, have two personal gripes. One, the fact that the weapons will soon become bland and some of them look silly, can be rectified by installing new weapon skins, which are very easy to find and install. Seemingly countless player skins and maps are also available. The second gripe is that while there is reason to not have aiming-down-the-sights, as this would obstruct some of your view, I wish the game at least gave the option for ADS. It always feels like your shooting from the hip like an idiot, after you've played games like CoD and others that have ADS. The punchy,fun-to-shoot guns of CSS just scream for the immersion of an ADS system.  Despit my personal issues. If you like fps games at all, or just want to have something to scratch the fps itch with once in a while, I cannot recommend CSS more strongly. Just buy it and play it. You won't ever stop.",

As in the original, Counter-Strike: Source pits a team of counter-terrorists against a team of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won either by completing an objective (such as detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the enemy team.  Counter-Strike: Source retains its team-based objective-oriented FPS style gameplay. The aim of playing a map is to accomplish a map's objective or killing the entire opposing team. The ultimate goal of the game is to win more rounds than the opposing team. Once players are killed, they do not respawn until the next round, though this depends on which server people play on. This gameplay feature distinguishes Counter-Strike from other first-person shooter games, where players respawn instantly or after a short delay.  +Very competetive and skill-based. +Still a strong community that will exist for years to come. +Works well with many and few players depending on the map. +Lots and lots of usermade content.  -Somewhat poor weapon balance.",

Back then, I'd probably find difficulty in saying if the game was any worthwhile given how poorly it compared to Counter-Strike 1.6.  It has grown to be it's own game though. Counter-Strike Source may pose to be the successor to 1.6, as if a up-to-date recreation of the original game, but it's controls, weapon handling and pace are unique. It also holds up audaciously given Valve's support for the Source Engine, looking very impressive and able to run smoothly on most hardware - including intergrated chipsets.   Counter-Strike Source still has a rich community of players, custom content and achievements so I implore you to try it ",

            "review_text": "It really surprises me that there's still tons of people that play this game, but it also confuses me at the same time because how old is this game? 10 years old or something like that. There are only two reasons why I bought this game and I'm going to be perfectly clear on that, 1) I got it for Gmod textures just like everybody else that's buying this game now and 2) I bought it out of curiosity to see what the game was like back when it was in its glory days. After playing it for about a few weeks I can easily say I didn't have the fun I expected, mainly because I can't. If you're new to this game franchise don't expect it to be anything like Call of duty or Battlefield, you will get your ♥♥♥ kicked pretty fast if you play thinking that. Now I wouldn't go off and say that this is the most tactical first person shooter ever, it's really not, but it requires a lot of teamwork, a lot of patience and good aiming, mostly headshots, so if you can't hit anyone in the head you're not going to get anywhere. I really like how this game encourages teamwork and that if you can't do that you're going to get steamrolled unless you're a complete badass, I also like how there was a long list of weapons that you could use to customize and suit your needs. I also really like playing on those servers that allow up to 40 people on them that make for some really good 20 versus 20 matches, those can be very chaotic but at the same time that's what makes it extremely fun to play. Unfortunately I'm already running out of good things to say about this game and I really hate the fact that I have to say that. Overall the biggest problems with this game is its community, it feels wrong to really dislike a game because of the people that play it but in counterstrike sources case that's the truth. Just like you would expect the community is full of nothing but haters, spammers, trolls, screaming 11-year-olds and people who think they're on top of the world just because they can kill you with a sniper rifle and while there are some good people, the bad mostly outweighs it. It's not only that but most of the servers you will go on will have people that are only willing to play one map which is usually dust or office and to make it even worse some of these people have the most inappropriate sprays I have ever seen. To add the icing on the cake there are some people that of been playing counterstrike source for years and are completely relentless against new players. We all know who I'm talking about, the people that can take you down in an instant as soon as you round the corner or the people that know every perfect peeking spot that you never thought to look at, I can't tell you how frustrating it is to walk 20 feet away from spawn only to get headshot across the map by a desert eagle when everyone in existence would agree that it was an impossible shot to make, yet these 'veterans' are able to do it on a regular basis. It's even more of an insult when you light them up with the entire magazine of your gun and they can take it like a champ and still kill you by shooting you once, by the way this all happens normally in casual servers. If you're out there looking for a new first person shooter to get behind it's hard for me to recommend counterstrike source unless you're extremely confident, a unnaturally perfect shot or can deal with some of the weird/annoying people that play this game or you need it for Gmod textures. Besides this is an old game, like a 12 year old game, I think there are a lot of other multiplayer shooters out there that are new and way more worth our time. Don't give me hate, I'm just one person with one opinion.",

This game, based on experience and what I've seen fom others, is better than Global Offensive, and is, even when it's not compared to the others, pretty damn good. Allow me to elaborate...   Let's start with gameplay. It's an FPS, or a First Person Shooter. You run around shotting people, a bit like the COD series. However, there are no sights, and accuracy is dependent on movement. Staying still and crouching is the most accurate, while running and jumping will almost certainly cause you to miss. Knives have a 100% chance to hit, if it collides with a player's hitbox. Headshots kill instantly, unless with the knife, However, unlike in GO (global offensive), backstabs with the knife are not instant kills. There is an AWP, called the Magnum Sniper Rifle, that is overused to quite a point.  This brings me to the community. Lots of people use the Magnum, and there is camping in most servers with people. However, the community is much more laid back than in GO, more casual than the intesne clans that rampage through GO. There is nothing to buy using IRL money, and nothing to trade. People know this, so you won't have challenges. There are knife fight duals though, that you may be challenged to. But there is no MLG crap in Source, at least not that I've run across. Hackers are few and far between, depending on server.  Many serers have plugins that you can use. A popular one is increased player count, allowing up to 64 people in a server. Deathmatch is a fun server plugin that removes bombs/hostages and allows respawn. Bunnyhop is a fun asthectic that allows you to jump many times in rapid sucession. AWP allows use of the Magnum Sniper Rifle. Bots is self explanatory.  Visuals are decent, but not mind-blowing. The game has decent graphics for this day and age, and good ones for it's time. There is the option to spray an image on the wall, usually the crappy default one. You can change it, however, and you can do it for free. You may import an image from your computer into the game to use as a spray. I myself have a Donald Trump/Adolf Hitler cross set as mine. GIF files are even supported. The game can run well on most computers, provided they don't use stone-age technology (Exxageration).  Overall, a good game for the casual gamer, and defineitly a game I reccomend. However, buy it when it's on sale. 21 dollars is too much. Eni out.  For those who want a TL;DR version, here you go:  'CS:S is a casual FPS with a decent community and nice graphics, that many computers will be able to run. It is overpriced, but you should buy it as soon as it goes on sale! There are no in-game purchases, so you should feel like you got your money's worth.'",

            "review_text": "Following up on the massive success that the original Counter-Strike has had, a new game was afterwards rereleased in Valve's shiny new engine, Source. Is it a good game?  Well, that's a question that may earn you a controversial answer. You'll get a lot of differing opinions depending on who you ask. But you need only take a look at how many people play all 3 main games (1.6, CSS, CSGO) to see how popular and huge this franchise is. It's good. But whenever you do ask this question you're bound to find people who are 1.6 outspoken diehards and claim Source to be a catastrophe and the 'worst game ever made' because it's not made exactly like 1.6 was. You've probably witnessed arguments, either in chatrooms or in forums about which is better, Source or 1.6. The answer? None. They both have their fanbases and they're going to stay that way for a long time, even with CS:GO out there. With that said, there are reasons why 1.6 is as popular as it is despite its age, and why very few hardcore 1.6 have moved to Source.  For one, it has tight near perfect controls, fully justifying its status as an e-sports to this day, and yes, it is more polished in this aspect than Source is. Two, the gameplay changes that were made from 1.6 to CSS have turned off most of the serious players that have some modicum of skill in 1.6 and aren't willing to just throw it away, especially when it's a game they enjoy and has a huge playerbase. This is different from say, the Starcraft: Brood War to Starcraft 2 move. Brood War was an old game, looked like an old game, but had its mechanics down to a science, which made it possible for it to remain an e-sports title for years. It didn't cease to be a popular title all the way until SC2 released, and that's because the basic mechanics of the game have not changed which allowed veterans to move in with ease and forget the old game entirely. This wasn't the case with 1.6 to Source. Source was made in a different engine, resulting in different gameplay and different fanbase. Whether that was intentional or not by Valve is irrelevant.   Now you may be wondering why I even brought up the whole 1.6 vs CSS discussion, but trust me, it's a given whenever anyone brings up CSS.   Truth is, CS: Source is fine. It's a great game that will feel different to you if you've played 1.6 long enough, but for newcomers they won't mind the changes or even realize they're there. It keeps the game modes and maps 1.6 had, gives them a much needed facelift, and with its huge community gamemodes and servers will be around for a very long time and keep you entertained for ages. I've had my share of fun with 1.6 with friends, and lots of gungame matches in CSS, which were my favorite. I've no huge complaints about the gameplay changes as I wasn't that big or skilled in 1.6 anyway, but am able to see where 1.6 players complaints came from as there are indeed changes, both good and bad, but nevertheless I was able to enjoy Source a lot easier than most people that had played 1.6 first.  It has its place in the Counter-Strike family, should not be missed, and you will more than likely have fun with it. And whatever complaints people might have about this one, it still manages to be better than most multiplayer FPSes out there. I'd skip to CS:GO by now, but you could still have some fun playing this one.",

You actually have to click. This means, however, that you could miss some shots or missclick and shoot a teammate. Not too bad though. -HUD isn't to cluttered. -Maps are nice for the engine.

I probably played 2 hours a day for about 3 years until i finally realised i wasted about $500 on going to the internet cafe when i suddenlt realised that it was available to play on Steam for $20!  The graphics are absolutely stunning for a game made so long ago. It still amazes me. The action is sharp with great muzzle flash and swaggy sound effects. It's literally amazing! The guns and weapons support players with many roles such as snipers, sniper rifles, smgs, assault rifles, machine guns, pistols, knives and grenades!  So the whole point of the game is to kill all enemies you see and in some modes you can plant a bomb. There are two sides. Terrorist and Counter-Terrorists. Each team has its' own unique guns fit for each of their roles. Terrorists are pushers which burst through the door and cause calamity at one bomb site while the others Counter-Terrorists have to run to the other site. Once the Terrorists plant the bomb the Counter-Terrorists must defuse the bomb to win. If Counter-Terrorists kill all the Terrorists after they plant the bomb they must defuse it first to win. If Counter-Terorrists kill all the Terrorists before they plant the bomb then Counter-Terrorists win. Counter-Terrorists have defensive guns. Terrorists have guns which are loud and offensive such as the AK-47. Guns can be picked up if a player does not have enough money. When a player dies, they need to wait for the round to end before they can respawn.   This game is absolutely epic! Great guns, great gameplay and great graphics. Achievements are also well developed and the action is really realistic. I had great fun playing this game! Just another great old game pulled of by Valve! Well done Valve!  9.5/10 Chop 2014",

Believe me you will never have as much fun in CS:GO as you can have in CS:S. Now in terms of competitive play, obviously you should go for CS:GO since it's current. Find a good community/group of servers in CS:S and play a mod/gamemode you like and you won't regret it.  Edit: CS:GO is getting a tiny bit better with maps ported from CS:S, but playing them just makes me want to play CS:S to be honest. I've played all the maps on CS:S already, would be better if they made new maps. Most of my time in CS:GO is spent playing casual or comp matchmaking which is pretty boring after awhile.",

It involves the very simple concept of two teams, the Terrorists and the Counter Terrorists, facing eachother in different scenarios.  PROS: + Strategical gameplay + Many different game types + Can play fine on lesser devices + Great graphics  + Smooth movement and control  CONS:  - Death is permanent and extremely rapid; most of the time, you are dead within a quarter second, and there's no respawn in the round other than in deathmatch - Fights are often unfair, luck-based and don't feel satisfying - Hitdetection/boxes are very wonky and make little sense. If guns in real life were as accurate as in this game, gun manufacturers would be doing something seriously wrong; it's insulting how bad some guns appear to be - Very beginner-unfriendly; the only way to get better is to grind hours of frustration and being really tryhard - It moreso feels like you're watching and spectating others rather than actually getting a chance to play it yourself - Many servers have premium restrictions and giving premium users unfair advantages over players without premium. I find this the most game-breaking aspect of all the other cons I mentioned.  I'm not a fan of the CS series for its gameplay that only people who have played the game hundreds of hours can adapt to, as well as the premium department of the game chewing up a lot of fun simply due their artificial skill (read: pay to win). A possibly great game ruined by difficult to fully grasp gameplay and swarming elitists and premium-infected servers. Only consider buying it if you're prepared to sit down and make the hours.

CSS is a classic Counter-Strike game that features a lively community that continues to survive and thrive. But boy is it flawed.  Two words: Lag. Compensation.  This is the biggest issue I have with this game. Its lag compensation system really drags the game into the dirt, making all those BS shots around a corner a common occurance. I cannot tell you how many times I died while behind a sturdy wall. It's happened almost every time I've peaked around a corner, making peaking something near impossible if there's a good player shooting at you.  'Get better internet!' I hear as I type this paragraph. I have/had pretty good internet, with an average ping way below 60. It's the fault of the server and the other players, which is a nice segway into the next topic of this review.  The ratio of modded servers to vanilla servers is about 10:1, and I'm being nice. When I say 'vanilla' I mean that the server retains the fundamentals of a CSmatch: pistol round, (so you don't start at $16000) not deathrun, jailbreak, no shop of any kind, or any other gamemodes that belong in GMOD, and   When you find a vanilla (or close, because most servers have a stat tracking mod) server, good luck having fun. Between the aforementioned lag compensation, the CS elitists, the stacked teams, and huge player count, (ranging in the 30s-40s) you will be getting stomped if you are even remotely fresh.  The game is a testament to how long a game lasts, with its large predecessor, Counter-Strike, still racking in plenty of players with double the modded servers and $16000 to start. People (namely self-proclaimed pros) prefer the classics because they have found all the exploits and have established themselves in the CS community some how: through maps, sound packs, textures, or server mods.  The game is old and dated when compared to CSGO. CSS and it's predcessors are full of people grasping tightly to a game on its last legs, and would rather call players of CSGO 'scrubs' than move on.",

There is the AWP which has 100% accuracy, and kills you in one hit, no matter what. There are also many useless guns, like the UMP, which does small amounts of damage, has a low rate of fire, and a small clip. The only redeeming quality it has is accuracy, which is nowhere near comparable to that of a rifle anyways. Another thing that bothered me was camping. On CS_Office, for example, you will run in an open door, only to be shot in the back by a terrorist armed with an AWP who was hiding on the other side of the door. As you can see, in my opinion, the worst part of this game was the community, who resort to using cheap tactics in order to win. Now, for the positive. Doing well (rescuing hostages, planting the bomb, killing lots of enemies) is very rewarding. You will get a rush of adrenaline when you manage to clear out a room of 3 enemies using only a DEagle. The game also recognizes this at the end of the round with the MVP system, in which the 3 best players on the winning team are announced for the entire server, and you get bragging rights. The emphasis on teamwork is another good point. You are more likely to survive the round if you stick with a buddy, that way while you are vulnerable while switching a weapon or a magazine, he can shoot any terrorist that walks into the room and takes you by surprise. The custom minigames (gun-game, zombies, deathrun, jailbreak) are also another good thing about this game. If you are deterred by the community of the vannila version, you can join these and it's like experiencing a whole other game with a different set of required skills. However, theses can also be extremely difficult to learn, but once you get enough experience in each of these games, you will end up dominating the game. All in all, don't get this game. The graphics and the sounds are outdated. The balancing is awful. The community is made up almost entirely of pros and campers. If you want to buy a Counter Strike game, you should get 1.6 or CS:GO.",

Not only is the graphics on a lower tier (But still playable and 'good enough') but it is a popular game. What does this mean for you? Well that means that finding matches of all types will not only be easier, but they will be more populated. I view this as a 'lower tier' CoD. Maps are fairly small and tight. However, this opens up the 'faster' gameplay. As soon as you spawn in you are fairly close to some sort of action (assuming you are on a moderatly populated server) However...  I honestly do not understand the hype to this game. Horrible graphics compared to most other shooters, gunplay is scetchy, and even the movement feels rigid (other players 'look' that way too). I would rather play BF or even CoD than waste my time with this game... But that is my 'NEED MORE REALISM' kicking in... If my computer could not run other 'high demand' shooters like BF4, then yes, this would be a great option. (although I would go for the csGO which is newer but has the same feel)",

Before you ask why the hell i have 120 hours on this game, it's because i was young and naive and thought this game was slightly above decent at the time. I spent hours on it thinking i would someday get better enough to acheive a slightly postivive K/D, i was dead wrong.

            "review_text": "Counter Strike: Source  If you want an honest and accurate review of this game, instead of over-hyped and fallacious fanboy critiques, read on.  Positives:  + A lot of different firearms to use, such as pistols, shotguns, submachineguns and sniper rifles..great variety. + Plenty of multiplayer maps to indulge in with a massive community still playing. + Singleplayer mode versus bots, which is fun for anyone and ideal for a relaxing playthrough. I really enjoyed this.  Negatives:  - Overly simplistic and primitive shooting. Iron sight zooming on all weapons is non-existent and only sniper rifles allow a scope zoom. The game relies heavily on crosshairs, which is an outdated idea. Counter Strike: Source was released in 2004, but has never been adjusted with time by developers, so it remains backward. - This game's multiplayer is not in any way tactical. It is focused on camping, 'bunny-hopping' to avoid bullets and flashbang grenade spamming. This is not skillfull or realistic.  - The game is not team oriented, despite the very obvious fact you have players on your multiplayer side. Other than that, the teams do not work together or use microphone frequently for communication, so any chances of formulating an assault strategy or defence is utterly futile. - Poor graphics which haven't been updated since 2004 and it seems, never will be. - No storyline mode to the game, meaning it is a purely multiplayer or singleplayer versus bots experience. There's no background or explanation for why the counter-terrorists are fighting terrorists, I can only surmise it's because that's their job, but it leaves me dissatisfied.   Overall Score: 5/10  Counter: Strike Source is a terrible multiplayer game. But, it is a really good singleplayer versus bots game which I had fun with. The multiplayer pulls the score down significantly. You can easily spend over 100 hours replaying maps against bots and enjoying yourself. If you're looking for a good multiplayer First Person Shooter, it's probably a better idea to check out Counter: Strike Global offensive, a far more modernised game than this one, albeit I suspect it will suffer from similar shortcomings.",

I look forward to seeing your head in my crosshairs hahaha. 8/10 game only because CS 1.6 and Condition Zero existed which were both better imo.

The graphics in my opinion are pretty nice, especially for a 2004 game, even today they look quite nice. The gameplay features Terrorist VS Counter-Terrorists, and when you select a team, you have 4 different models to chose from for each team (Such as SAS and Seal Team 6 for Counter-Terrorists) and there are no classes. Instead of classes, you earn money to spend on guns and equipment in the next round, so as long as you can afford it and hold it in your inventory (I don't think you can carry multiple Assault Rifles e.t.c) you can pretty much make your own class. Want to be a Sniper with Night Vision? Go for it! Want to be a Shotgunner or Light Machine Gunner with an armored vest and helmet? Go ahead! If you are the kind of person who likes to communicate with the team or you have friends to play with, then teamwork will most likely be successful. Team work is the main point of this game after all. I'm not the kind of person who communicates with people I don't know, and I haven't played this with any of my friends yet, so team work hasn't been great for me, but that doesn't matter, it should be good for the majority of people. My only problems with this game, the maps can be a little too closed sometimes, but that's probably just me, and the armor doesn't feel like it does much (I know it does, it just doesn't feel like it (Probably because I keep getting headshotted)).  Graphics: 7/10 Audio: 6/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Overall: 8/10 This game is a classic!

Before you knew it, I had gave the guy behind the counter another $20 and played for 9 hours straight that day. I only stopped because they were closing. The next day at school, it was all I could think about and I couldn't leave school soon enough to give that guy behind the counter another $20 to play for another 8 hours. If you added those hours plus the hours I put when I finally got a CSS last Fall, I definitely had over 400 hours of this game logged. And I'm still not that great. There is someone always better than you in this game because 400+ hours is moderate to some of the people who play this game.

My rating: 10/10  Review: Counter-Strike: Source is a late predecessor of current generation First Person Shooters that has adopted and retained mechanics that are reminiscent of its former titles in the series. The level of skill required to master the game is in most aspects to a higher difficulty than that of other FPS games. Accompanying the base game, community made modifications including maps, skins or game modes can be found in the server browser. Unlike other common games however, Counter-Strike does not award players constantly with rewards or achievements nor does it have a leveling system. For a game made 10 years ago, the quality in development and execution is tremendous. These characteristics are reverberated throughout each of the Counter-Strike games and thus makes it one of my most favourite series of all.",

So the next day I started watching Garry's Mod videos and I totally fell in love with it. So the next weekend I told my dad about it. ' Dad, there's this cool game that I want. It's called Garry's Mod. You think I can get it?' I said. ' Well let me look at it.' He replied. So after he was done looking at he said to me, 'Buddy, you need a Source game for this to work.' 'Well, how much is a source game?' I replied. '20 dollars.' (he was looking at CS:S) so the next time I got the money to afford, I got the games. I instantly installed both of them and launched Garry's Mod right away. It kept me busy for a few weeks, but then the worst thing happened.... Boredem. So as I scrolled through my games I saw it; Counter Strike: Source. I was bored so I said that I'll give it a shot. So I joined a server that was hosting the office map (At this point in time I didn't know it was a popular map.) When I first got into the game I was in a garage. I looked up at the mission objective. It said something along the lines of, 'Secure all the hostages in the hostage rescue zone.' I then told my team that this was my first time playing. I fellow teammate told me to buy a P90. I followed his instructions as he told me to follow him. Once my team pushed the Terrorists back, there was a hall that had a couple of guys in it. My friend told him to do what he did. He ran out and sprayed his P90 he got one guy, but the other to murdered him. I was furious of watching my instructor/friend die. I then did exactly what he told me to do, 'Spray n' pray.' So I jumped out of cover and sprayed them down, watching their own blood spurt out of themselves. My first 2 kills. I felt so alive. But sadly the next corner I did it, I got shot and died because I ran out of ammo. Right when I died, I heard my buddy say, 'That's how you do it, man!' So I played a little more until I had to go. I told my friend thank you and that he helped me alot. I really wish that I knew about the friending system (I only got Steam for Garry's Mod.) But that day and that friend, was what lit the spark for my desire of Counter Strike. I would have more hours on this game, but CS: GO came out shortly. That's why I have about 500 hours on it. But this, was my CS: S life story.   Rust in pepperoni, First 2 kills",

In sixth grade, I would wake up for school at 5:30 AM, but then I started getting up at 4:30 just to get a couple rounds in before class. Call it dedication or a sickening obsession, but I was hooked on CS (nevermind my neighbor who broke into my house to play while I slept!) It was more than a game. It was my social hub, my iTunes visualizer, and my brief entryway into game design (which didn’t go very far.) It is and remains a standout multiplayer shooter that paved the way for things to come with Call of Duty and Battlefield.  Being eight years since the excellent Source remake, Valve has decided it’s time to give the game another facelift. What started as a Source port for consoles became a more ambitious project that included PC. While there are no radical departures in Global Offensive, it is without a doubt a reboot. Valve has just hit the reset button on the series, once again. As drastic and premature of a maneuver it may be, there is no denying that Counter-Strike remains an addictive and rewarding competitive shooter like no other. Counter-Strike was born on PC and it is there that its largest community of players will stay. Nevertheless, Valve wished to branch out and get their hands on some of that Call of Duty money. Even so, the game still plays like classic CS: this is white-knuckled gaming not for the easily impatient and frustrated. It’s true that the game has been rebuilt almost completely, but the majority of changes are superficial and surface level: A chime plays when you kill, you are rewarded with progress points and achievements that do nothing, and the game’s player models have become greatly improved.  If you are new to the series, here’s what you can expect. CS is a slow-paced game -- funny thing is that it was pretty fast in the days of Rainbow Six -- where two teams try to eliminate each other while attempting a secondary objective (rescue hostages or plant a bomb). The two defining features of the game are the permanent death that forces players to spectate until the next round begins, and the ability to purchase weapons and equipment at the start of each round with money earned from kills and victories. You can find these features in Call of Duty’s Search and Destroy mode as well as Shadowrun (2007), but outside a couple mods for Quake and Unreal Tournament no one has attempted to replicate the full package. What I love most of all about CS are the maps and Valve seems to know as much. Nine classic maps are included in this download, in addition to eight new maps for the two new game modes (more on this below). You’ll find some minor changes made to Italy and Dust, but it’s not exactly going to put a stop to your nostalgia or established strategies. Since death comes quickly, you’ll need to learn the maps inside-and-out so you can cover all your corners. You’ll also need to keep quiet, as this is a game where hearing nearby footsteps can change the course of a round. Above all, you’ll need to be incredibly accurate and control your weapon. This is where things get a bit rough for console players. Without accuracy and player awareness, you don’t stand a chance in the brutal servers of CS:GO.  ",

I have utterly enjoyed this wonderful game!  OVERVIEW Counter-Strike Source is a upgraded version of Counter Strike 1.6. Better graphics , better performence and so on. It is a skill based game that WAS taken seriously by a lot of people who enjoyed the skill-ness of the game. [No that is not a word.] Pros: + Amazing Gunplay Mechanics! + Last time this game's graphics was considered insane! + No level up system, [you don't need to unlock weapons by leveling up like in games like COD] + A kind community , even today there are tons of players playing!  + This game needs TONS of teamwork if you are playing PUGs. [Competitive Mode] + Legendary maps! + Hundreds of modded maps and gamemodes like surf , bhop , Zombie Escape and jailbreak! [The more popular ones]   Cons: - Nothing.  Extras:  You can hide bombs under barrels! NOTE: Valve doesn't support the game anymore , if you're looking for a game that constantly is being updated , play CS:GO , Valve has already left this game. But players are still playing!  I r8 it 10/10  To those of you guys who play CS:GO you'll get what I'm trying to say.    ",

I will give my honest opinion.  So, CSS. I picked this game up early in my gaming career when I started out playing games on a dell d630. At the lowest settings this game looks about the same as cranking the graphics up to high. Most of the hours I spent in this game was playing with bots on car rides and journeys. I enjoy the gunplay and the weapons are not as in depth compared to its bigger brother. The maps are very well designed and I didnt find a single one I absolutely hated. What makes me like this game over its bigger brother is the lesser competitive feel. You can definitely tell that CSGO was designed from the ground up to be a highly competitive game. However that is not what I look for in a game. I tend to focus on how much fun I have had with a game. Now it might be my nostalgia from playing this at 30fps at 480p but I still think this is the game to pick up if you are looking for a fun, brief round of shooty fun.",

A few years, and a few computer upgrades, and a cable internet connection later, I decided to give it a go again. Haven't gone more than a few days without playing since.  The bad parts:   The hit detection can be freakishly accurate or horribly inaccurate based on gun type, player skill, and the phase of the moon. If your moving, there are times you can't hit a guy at point blank range inside an elevator with a sub machine gun, but his buddy halfway across the map will stop and aim for a half a second and headshot you through the crack in the door with a pistol.

But, due to the control scheme of this game, its just pick up and play, the controls are that simple.  Maps are generally well rounded and there are maps which constantly force you to stratagise with teammates in order to win, going solo is not an option. Weapons gradually get more expensive to the degree of their power and rate of fire.  This is by all means, not an easy game and when you look on the face of it, not a very deep one, but look deeper! This is one of those masterful gems hidden in plain sight with some of the easiest control schemes and deep strategy. A must buy!",

But one down side of the game personally is the overall gameplay if you're excluding the many game modes, these are very similary played as the other counter strike games but the main difference is that source lacks creativity in that particular part, it's the exact same as the other counter strike games. It's still fun to play if you're going to play it with a friend or two but alone might not be the optimal choice especially for a game like this.  But that is when the game modes comes in. There's a lot of modes that are interesting to play making source have a very high entertainment value in comparision with all the other shooter games like battlefield and CoD. It's kind of as if source has subcategorized games inside the original one, and the game itself is cheap and it has a very simple learning curve (unless you  wanna become a proffessional player of course, that's quite impossible for me). That's why I recommend you playing it, even  if you're not very much into a competetive shooter game, there's modes like Zombie mode or zombie escape, surf too.  8/10, would buy again.",

If you want the full experience of what counter strike has to offer just start the game up search for server map fy_iceworld and enjoy the bloodbath. After an hour or so when you wonder 'is that all there is to this game?' exit the game and go play TF2 this will leave you with fond memories and a well rounded knowledge of everything the game has to offer.",

Even if you die at the start of a round, the most you'll have to wait is 2 and a half mins before you go off again for the next round, and i like the fact that when you die in a round, thats it, none of that 10 seconds then respawn nonsense that for me kills stone dead most games of this genre....

For example I think it took a while after the release to update the player models. It was also a bit too easy to get headshots at first. But when the patches came out these issues were addressed, it was amazing how you could see what each player was carrying. The grenades and explosions are much better than 1.6 as well thanks to the improved physics engine. Now CSGO is out though, which improves on this further, so not much point in getting it.",

The hit detection is specially designed to make some of your shots miss if you just spam shots. This is probably one of the most challenging multiplayer shooter games of all time.  That aside, the gameplay itself is smooth and enjoyable. You usually either go all sneak, or all rush. Either way, you absolutely must have good reflexes to get anywhere on the scoreboard. All guns have a great balance to them, and it's good, like any other well-balanced game, to find which one suits your style. Like I mentioned before, it's not a good idea to spam with most of the guns. However, if you get a weapon like the P90 or the MP5 this isn't as true.  The graphics, considering the game's age, are excellent. Sharp textures and realistic shading weren't really a thing back then (and honestly still aren't now, but I digress) but the game definitely holds its own against other games from the time.  The sound quality is on the low end, but this is merely in homage to the original version of the game/mod, back in the late 90's. That said, it doesn't take much from the experience and adds a bonus nolstagia to players of the original game.  Like many older multiplayer shooters, there isn't much in terms of progression. If you like, for example, the ranking system from CoD or BF, you won't find anything of that sort here. It definitely is a possible negative for some.  Last but not least, this game still has a large community to this day. There are many, many custom maps, mods, etc. I personally stick with the base game most of the time, but if you get bored, you can escape to them. Anyways, the community consists mostly of players in their late teens and older. You won't find many children in this game. Beware, however. If you are a child yourself (under the age of 16 atleast) you may find many grumpy people who won't like you and especially your voice. You have been warned.  Overall, this is a wonderful game. I play it on and off, but I have no doubt that is indeed a classic.",

To speak again about Valve, you'll do their teams more justice looking around their other games like Portals as I said. You'll have lots of opportunities, solo, speed run, multiplayer coo op. or even just alone on the Half Lifes.

Now, what's so frustrating about this is that you, well, die in one hit. It might not sound like a lot, but in reality, when someone peeks out from behind a wall for a split-second and you're dead, you're not going to be a happy camper. (Speaking of campers, yes.) Now that I have my AWP rant over with, here:  Pros: -Classic game, the best Counter-Strike in my opinion -Great playerbase, teaching and forgiving (Sometimes) -Tons of servers, some modded with their own game modes -Some servers ban AWP (YES) -A ton of fun to play -Never really gets old, always new challenges -Very difficult to master, gives you something to work for  Cons: -AWP -The same playerbase will flame you for missing a headshot at nine thousand yards with a Mac-10 -Some people think they are MLG because they can AWP -AWP -a bit more AWP -You're going to rage.

            "review_text": "This game was built using a economy system in order to balance the guns. The most powerful guns were hard to get, and if you lost them, you lost a lot of money. Which made your climb back up even harder. This made an instant kill gun like the awp, more reasonable as it was a rare and hard to acquire weapon. In a similar fashion, the AK-47, the M16, and the Deagle all made their respective ownership harder to come by.   This system is no longer in place. A majority, if not all servers at this point, give you the max amount of money possible which means you'll be buying a game full of primarily useless guns. As the best guns are the high damage weapons with predicatble recoil. The most popular still being the awp for it's infamous one hit kill status. Which renders the game rather simple, with an unforgivable difficulty curve.  Other than a poor balancing structure limiting gameplay choice, this game was made long before modern gaming design concepts such as silhouette recognition, colour seperation, or animation recognition were ever implemented. So you will struggle to decipher friend or foe from a distance, and that is after you manage to discern them from the often dark and mangy backgrounds.  This game made waves when it first arrived, and with good reason. But nowadays it's just old. Really old. And it has not aged well. Anyone who is used to, or learned from, modern design conviences in gameplay will simply not have an easy time adjusting. As well as an old engine resulting in things like bullets coming out of your head or your crotch, depending on how your standing. You could call this difficulty, but it would be difficulty in the same way that it is more difficult to find your location on a topographical map, then a map of a mall.  All of this really only contributes to the already large difficulty curve new players will face when coming into such a long lived community. The community is by no means bad, but their general high skill level means you will not have an easy time learning. Though that does deter small children from playing... so there's that.   TL;DR: ♥♥♥♥♥ unbalanced, competative difficulty is through the roof, overal graphic design is fugly and difficult to understand but hey! No kids. 10/10 If you don't already own it, don't ♥♥♥♥in buy it.",

There used to be a website called  www.theclq.com  that compiled all of your stats based on your gamer ID#. I at one point (glory days, and ealry stages of CS, ranked 113 in the world.) Play this game, and when you think you're done... play it some more. Master everything in the game. Become unstoppable - it's a lot of fun to dominate in a competitive FPS.",

Pros: 1.Good mechanics 2.Worth the money 3.Much more fun and easier than cs go(for me)  Cons: 1.Massive amount of people play only at a certain time. 2.Alot of Modded maps   Ofc.....the less players only happends to me....i get over it when i play at midnight or at 3.00a,m, in the morning.

At that era in time, we also spent time at our cousins playing the Commodore 64. Yes, those were the good old days, until I bought my first desktop computer in 1997. I played a lot of Starcraft, and Command &amp; Conquer in those days when internet gaming was pretty much non-existant.  Years had passed and I was into the wonderful technology of hardline internet gaming. I had played a tonne of Unreal Tournament and at that time I was introduced to Counterstrike. Boy, let me tell you my world changed from that point and I was instantly hooked. Every boy wants to play with real guns, and this was it!  I played CS for years before Steam, and Counterstike Source came along. I bet I would have logged 2000+ hours of gaming with all of the CS's together.   I loved playing Source, I spent my hard earned money for 2 years going to a network gaming cafe before buying my own cpu and copy of it. I remember playing people online and they'd always complain that I was hacking. A lot of times I would have a 9-1 kill to death ratio. Yes, kids hated me, but my clan of friends loved me.   So, long and short of it all...Honestly, I do have an addictive personality, but gaming is far from harmful compared to drugs and alcohol. I admit, Counterstrike, SAVED MY LIFE!!!!",

That should mean something for an older game.  I love that you can use whatever you want for your spray logo in game. I think Valve should bring back using your own Spray Logos for CSGO. Was dissapointed to find I couldnt just use my own spray in CSGO. I think in some ways with CSGO they havent gotten away from their Modding Roots. You dont have to, or feel like you want to, dish out money for extra things in CS:S and that is a huge plus!   5 out of 5 stars",
