    "description": "In Where is my Heart? you play the story of a family of forest spirits. The family lives comfortably in a tree in the woods until one day they lose their home and thus embark on a great adventure. Their journey will take them through the mushroom caves and even deeper down to the lifeless crystal pools and back up into the mountains.",

            "review_text": "So what is Where is my Heart? Is it a platformer? Is it a puzzle game? Well, it's a little of both. Okay okay, so that was a generic opening, but it is what it is. Where is my Heart is unique among puzzle platformers in that the levels are broken-up into fragments. As the player explores to the edge of one segment, they must watch the rest of the screen to see which segment the character will be navigating next. It's a little bit of spice that makes what would otherwise be a bland and straight-forward platforming game into a puzzle, almost in the literal sense as the player is required to look at a jumble of pieces, and try to make-out the greater whole.  Story-wise, I couldn't tell you what's going on. I remember reading a quick summary on the store page, but the game itself doesn't make much mention of it, and that's fine. During the game, the player controls one of three members of a monster family. One looking like a Domo wannabe, one orange thing, and a vampire, because of course there's going to be a vampire. The player must toggle between them to navigate the levels; using them as stepping stones to reach higher ledges, or unlocking character-specific locks that reveal a passage elsewhere on the level, and even forming a sort of totem to turn the top member into a special spirit beast.  Yes, each member can turn into a special spirit beast, and it's often required to do-so in order to complete the level. The brown monster turns into a forest spirit that can double-jump, allowing him to reach higher platforms; meanwhile the other two members of the family turn into spirits so that he can take them with him. This allows the player to reach areas that would otherwise require someone to be left behind after being used as a stepping stone without needing to leave anyone behind. The orange monster turns into a rainbow spirit that lets you rotate the segments while she remains in the same spot on the screen, thus allowing her to skip around the stage (though it has its risks if the player tries to 'teleport' into solid ground, or stays in a space without a segment). Finally, the gray monster (the vampire) turns into a bat spirit that can see hidden passages and platforms that he can use so that the other two can use him as a stepping stone.  The levels are short, but sweet. It's a case of quality over quantity, allowing the player to focus on a smaller playing field while trying to figure out how to navigate the heroes to the end goal. Every level has two goals. The first is to simply get each hero to the end goal, and the second goal is to collect all hearts without letting anyone die. The first goal is oftentimes simple enough, where some of the levels will really stretch the player's mind to figure out where that heart with very little context clues in its tiny segment might be hiding in what would otherwise be plain sight if the level wasn't broken-up into scattered segments. The only real hassle is that once the path to the end goal has been opened up, it can feel like a bit of a chore having to manually walk the other two characters over there to finish the level. Some levels require the other characters to take a new path, but for most levels it's just selecting the next character to walk the same path three times.  What few faults this game has are out-weighed by it's over-all charm, so I can definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a good puzzle/platformer.",

            "review_text": "For once in a blue moon I see an interesting puzzle platformer which plays tricks on perception. We see the scene like through a prism that divides a screen into several partly overlapping and sometimes disjointed fragments. Only combining them in our conscience into a whole we can predict the needed jumping power to cross a gap we don't see directly. We just can guess it through observing the dynamic of characters' motion in and out of those small parts. Feels very hallucinative. The product is clearly made up in a quality manner for calm puzzles lovers.  Интересная платформенная головоломка (в кои-то веки), заигрывающая со зрительным восприятием. Мы видим сцену какбы сквозь призму, которая делит изображение на частично перекрывающиеся или слегка разрозненные фрагменты. Лишь соединив их в своем сознании в цельное полотно мы можем рассчитать, например, силу прыжка через пропасть, ширину которой мы непосредственно не воспринимаем, а можем лишь угадывать по динамике исчезновения и появления героев на краях фрагментов. Крайне глючно. Проект явно сделан качественно для любителей спокойных головоломок.",

On top of the very unique gameplay the game features very enjoyable 8-bit inspiried art and a absolutely joyful musical track. I HIGHLY recommend Where is my Heart for anyone who wants to smile :)  If you want to see some gameplay I have a first look of it. I do however suggest you experience this gem for yourself.

It's short, but not excessively so and at a fair price point. mechnically, it's a well-made, disorienting puzzler. the mechanics don't wear out their welcome, the level design remains smart and varied throughout, the art design is stellar, the ambience and music peaceful and evocative, and the game communicates the ideas it wants to in the time it takes.  but most significant to me is that it made me feel way more than I expected to. it's got a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ beautiful, shining, heartbreaking soul underneath its innocent pixel art that grew wings and expressed an incredibly complex mix of love worn weary and desperate that still hangs on. it's abstract, but it's all there, and everything fit for me such that it's arguably one of the most meaningful games i've ever played.",

It's a cutesy platformer, but not a particuarly well done one. Your task is to navigate three little animal-like beings through extremely disorienting scenes, sometimes doing blind jumps in the hopes of reaching a platform that you have no way of knowing is there.  Unfortunatelly, I can't really recommend it for the current price, unless you are a huge fan of this particular kind of puzzle. There are many platformers that are both better and cheaper than Where is My Heart.",
