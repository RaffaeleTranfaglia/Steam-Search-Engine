            "review_text": "A disgustingly bad business model on an otherwise fantastic game..  It's such a shame when you come across a fantastic game that's ruined by one of the worst payment models in any game you've ever seen. TheHunter is one of those games. What can you do for free, you ask? Well, you can hunt Mule Deer. That's it. That's all you can do. Shoot Mule Deer with one gun, one type of ammo. The default stuff you start with is all you get. It says you can also hunt Cottontail Rabbits, ah but the catch is you need to buy the correct gun to use in order to be allowed to hunt it. So, Rabbits aren't even free either.  Can you earn enough to eventually buy another gun? Only one other gun is available for purchase using the game's earned currency (called gm$). Every other gun must be bought using real world money (called em$). And that's not all.  Want the privilege to be able to hunt something else? You need to buy licenses. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they come in 1 day, 7 day, and 28 day variants. Yup, that's right. They expire. So you have to buy them multiple times to continue hunting what you want. Buy a 1 day license but then get called in to work? Congrats! You've just wasted your money! You CAN buy these with gm$, but the costs are so high that you'll be farming Mule Deer for weeks in order to finally be able to experience something else.  Oh but hold on. It's not like each kill you make earns you gm$. Hah! You wish! Nope. The only way to earn gm$ is to complete 'missions' which range from tracking certain animals, spotting certain animals, and harvesting certain animals, among other similar tasks. Doesn't sound so bad, does it? Well, they typically reward only 100 gm$ for each mission, and your shotgun costs 6300 gm$, a typical 1 day license costs anywhere between 1800 - 2400 gm$. For ONE DAY, for ONE SPECIE. Let that sink in.  Would I recommend this game? Based on its business model at the time of writing? NO WAY. Stay FAR away from this cash-grab game, unless you enjoy having them grab at your pockets the moment you try their game.  Also, NEVER EVER EVER DO ANY OF THE 3RD PARTY STUFF THEY ASK YOU TO DO. You can do things like surveys, downloads, watch videos, etc. to earn some em$ (that's right, paid currency). But most of these third party 'offers' infect your computer with all sorts of malware, and most of them don't end up forking over the em$ at the end. You'll be turned away from most surveys because you 'aren't the target consumer'. For instance, when I answered that I was a white male on a survey, I was immediately declined and turned away, reward not given.  If the payment model is improved? I would recommend this game in a heartbeat. It's fun to play, all the shady practices considered. I just wish they had gone about their payment model better than this garbage. Oh well, someone else will come along and do it right eventually.",

This game would be great, if you just had to pay, say, $20 a month and have access to all content, but this is not the case. First, you pay about $3 a month to be able have infinite liscenses and shoot everything. But you can't shoot everything because the starting rifle only has specific species it can shoot. In order to get more powerful guns, you must pay real life cash. The conversion rate is rougly $1 to 100 ingame currency, but many weapons cost more than 500.  This means you must pay $5 for an ingame gun along with the $3 a month to shoot a virtual deer that will most likely see/smell you if you don't pay for ingame camo which is even more expensive than the gun.  *Edit April 11th, 2016, I accidently a word",

            "review_text": "I've got about 140hrs in this game before it came to steam, which gives a total of ~200.  I have also spent over 100$ for in-game items and licences. I'm guessing the only reason why I played it for so much was the fact, that there aren't any other decent hunting games.  Unfortunatelly I really can't recommend this game to any new players.  First of all, it gets more and more outdated because engine is getting old and has plenty of limitations.  Secondly, the game is not Free to Play at all. Free accounts have access to 2 terrible guns, one bad scope and can only hunt a few animal species. You might be able to spot a boar but you won't be able to shoot it. Frustrating.  You have to buy licences to hunt all the animal species, and you can buy a licence for 3, 6 or 12 months. Yeah, it's a subscription fee, to play this game. And that's not everything. Then you learn about ethical weapons and the fact, that you need different weapons to hunt different species. Quickly you realise that you need to buy extra wepons and you can only do that with rl money. So you spend extra 50$ on a proper rifle with good scope, a revolver, pistol holster, a bow, a backpack to carry all that stuff, maybe some camo clothing or a fancy binocs with rangefinder.  Now you can start to hunt and it's quite fun. For a while... Then you get to the same point I did. You have killed every single animal species, long range, short range, revolver kills, bow kills. What can I do next?  Misssions. Missions reward you with in-game currency that can be used to buy mostly consumable items. Honestly, there is nothing usefull that you can buy for that. Forget about buying guns or even callers. It gets worse. Many, many of the missions require you to use a specific weapon to complete them. You either spend rl money on some crappy gun (but I need it for a mission) or just ignore missions completly, since they are a waste of time.  Then you move to competitions. Some competitions require specific guns but there should be plenty available where you can compete with any gun. To win a comp, usually you need to harvest a highest scoring animal. Most comps last 48hrs, some of them have limited attempts. Winning a comp gives you a trophy and some em$. That's the currency that is usually only purchaseable with rl money! You might think that this is solution to all your problems. Win enough comps and be able to afford guns and items.  Sorry to disappoint you. Unless you are willing to spend countless hours, you won't win a thing.  You might get lucky and bag a winning animal on your first attempt, but chances for that are extremly low. From my experience: winning a comp that wasn't even very popular (not many players competing) required around 12 hours of playing (6hrs a day).  You will find out that most of the players, still playing this game, are massive no-lifers. MASSIVE. There are competitions that require you to bag as many animals as possible in 48hrs period of time. Regularly you will have players that are willing to spend up to 40hrs online in that period (forget about sleeping etc) just to win a reward that is worth 1-2$. Soon you will realise that you're better off paying 5$ for a new gun that spending 100hrs doing competitions.  Eventually, there is no reason to keep playing this game. You got every animal, had some fun. Missions are pointless and a cashgrab attempt, competitions are for people with no jobs, who can pay 10+ hrs a day.",

            "review_text": "There are so many animals in this game its like you are acually hunting. Spend hours hunting down animals alone or with your friends. Hunt down deer, bears, ducks, pheasants, rabbits, boars, ect. The amount of hours that any player could have put in to this game would have been amazing.  Sounds like a good game right, well if its a good game why am i not recommending it, well here is the reason why. The store page is lieing, to you there is nothing in this game that makes it free-2-play. The 4 hours i spent playing this game i was so confused on why i couldn't shoot a boar THAT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. Turns out you need a liecense for almost every animal. You can only kill 2 animals if you are a free-2-play player, which is mule deer and rabbits (which in my opinion the hardest animals to find). I spent 2 hours looking for mule deers, I looked up guides, I tried different approaches, and still couldn't even see one. i was following a mule deer's tracks for a full hour and everytime i would get close it would run away (now keep in mind I was crouching the entire time and I didnt even get to see the damn thing). Also, while I was looking for the mule deer i found a whitetail deer, a pheasant, and a boar, WHICH WERE EASY KILLS. So this the games logic, I have to pay in order to click on animals. Yes that makes so much sense, my god i would rather go hunting in real life. Oh and i didnt even get to the equipent, guess how many weapons you get, just guess, ONE. It makes no sense to me how you only get ONE weapon in a hunting game. Ok let me tell you everything you get when you first start the game. You get a sniper rifle, a huntermate (a GPS/tracker), a mule deer caller, a camera, and binoculars. Now you might think that that is exactly what you need to go hunting. Well your wrong, because the full 4 hours i was playing the game i kept finding everything other than mule deer. Oh and I almost forgot mule deers are only found on one map, and there are i believe 8 maps. So let me get this straight there are 8 maps in this game, the animals that you are able to kill are only available in 1 map, and you only get 2 animals that you are able to kill. Yeah this is definatly free-2-play. Oh yeah also, if you want to be able to kill all the animals in the game you have to get a license. If you want to know something similar to this system, its like Xbox Live. You pay 14.99 for a 3 month license. WTF thats criminal now a days, now if you are the kind person that doesnt mind paying, then thats great this game is for you. But its still very stupid that you have to do such a thing like that.  Hey Expansive Worlds and Avalanche Studios, let me teach you something about free-2-play.  In order to make a good free-2-play game you must be able to make sacrifcises. Sacrificises such as being able to hunt down every animal in 1 map (not 2 you greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s), be able to give the player 1 of every weapon, and a caller for those animals. Now is that so hard. If you listen to this review and do what i say this will definately make this game, The Best Hunting Game Ever Made. It has the potential.  The final verdict for this game is:  3/10  and if you listen to my suggetions it would probably make the game at least:  7/10  Think about it",

            "review_text": "Feels like a good game being hijacked by Wall Street.  1. It's a demo, not a F2P game by any regard. There's no logical way to progress without paying.  2. It's subscription-based despite being mainly a singleplayer game with token multiplayer.  3. Even if you subscribe, there are semi-arbitrary limitations on what guns can be used on what animal, forcing you to A. Buy two more guns B. Buy a shotgun and then continuously buy special ammo. C. Buy a bow, which is far harder to use than any other weapon. Either way, you either pay more or pay some and gimp yourself.  4. Even if you buy the subscription and then guns you've only made the game passable. Forget about accessing any other guns, utilities or clothing without paying even more. So be prepared for about $18 just to get the very basics, and at only a 3-month lease to boot.  5. The retail version of the game right now is about $16, for which you get 7 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. The 'Starter Pack' closest to that one is $32 for 4 weapons, 6 months subscription and assorted goodies. Here's a hint. The first one is a decent price. The second one is deliberate milking of its customers for even less content.   So yes, the game itself is something I'd definitely see myself playing, but even after subscribing I can't motivate myself to throw more and more money at it to get anywhere. It's a nice enough game, with well-made environments and soundscape, but without a campaign of any kind or more elaborate multiplayer experience it's more of a 'pick it up every now and then to relax' type of game. Which is fine, but completely hampered by the constant money grabbing - as a one-off I'd happily pay $25-40 for it, but for that kind of money now you'd barely get 10% of the full game and a subscription ending  to watch out for.  [edit] Turns out that even if you have the licensing and the appropriate gun, you need to shell out more cash for hunting some species (e.g. mallards) for decoys and whatnot, or get shafted. Neat.",

This wouldn't be so bad if there were only mule deers on the map, but no, every animal that is huntable, you can find and thats where it really gets frustrating. You are hunting a deer for 40 to 50 minutes, get to the best shooting spot you can find, only to find out when you pull the trigger, that it is a white tail deer and you dont have a license to shoot it. The free membership is a farce. It is a really bad demo at best. I guess it would be a great game if it wasn't for this ridiculous payment model. Please Valve, do something about this F2P Tag.",

            "review_text": "I am a long time player and will try to make this review informative and realistic.  *** Gameplay I tried this game and liked it so much that I purchased a one-year membership after a few days. The relaxed and realistic atmosphere is likely one of the biggest sellers for the game. You basically roam the woods looking for animals, or clues that can lead you to them. There are a lot more animals in the game than what you would see in real life. Also the animals are less shy than in nature, so that you will find plenty of them even in a short hunting session. You will discover traces on the ground or hear animals call somewhere in the distance. Once an animal is tracked down, you may opt for a kill or move on. Tracking gets easier the more you play. With the increasing number of tracks that you pick up, your skill level rises and tracking becomes easier. It also happens a lot that you see single animals or a group of them roaming around as you walk through the reserves. This game is not for someone trying to get satisfaction in a lot of animal shooting in a short time.   *** Memberships All players start as 'guest' and receives a free rifle and life-long free ammunition for this gun and some basic equipment. A membership is a time-limited license that will unlock all animals, free ammunition for all weapons, and also the ability to host multiplayer parties. A permanent license is not available.  *** Hunting Grounds The reserves in the western part of this world resemble of American continent-based areas, the eastern part holds areas that you could easily find in Europe. Currently seven reserves are available. Each has its own charm and of course its animal species. At the beginning of every hunt you select a reserve. You can start from a permanent lodge or from a tent that you have placed in the reserve before. The maps are very big and if needed there is a fast travelling system.  *** Animals At this point the game features 18 species. Some of them can attack the player. Many can be lured with callers, scents or decoys. Then there are baiting stations that will bring the animals to a certain location. Most bird species are only scored if shot in the air, which is always a fun challenge. For many species unusual fur variations can be found, some of which are truly rare. Shooting such a rare animal is just as special as a trophy buck. Shooting animals in theHunter quite demanding. The animals have bones and organs, and every shot should be thought through before the trigger is pulled. Hitting vital organs will lead to death, bad shots can result in a follow-up search.  *** Weapons A host of rifles is available, all of which can be equipped with scopes for longer shots. Using the open sights can be just as much fun though. Depending on the knock-down capabilities of these guns they are allowed to be used for larger or smaller game. There is also a selection of handguns, some with plenty of power to even kill a moose. Shotguns can be used with three types of ammunition, which makes them all-around weapons for all animals.  Shooting guns makes all animals in the area flee. Bows can be used as silent killers and will not alarm other animals unless they are really close.  *** Equipment There is equipment that can be permanently placed in the reserves. Tents let you to start a hunt where ever you placed them before, and they give you access to your entire inventory just like a lodge. There are treestands that can be mounted to trees for a better overview of the area. Ground and waterfowl blinds protect you on the ground from being seen, and a tripod stand provides some elevation for easier animal spotting.   *** In-game Money All game items are paid with the in-game currency em$. It can be purchased with real money, won in competitions, or earned by completing third-party offers. Also there are gm$ that can be earned by completing missions, allowing to buy consumables. Non-consumable items belong to the player permanently, even if a membership expires.   *** Missions Currently there are a total of 245 missions available. Most mission packs start rather easy and become increasingly more difficult. You will end up shooting pheasants or geese in air with bows, or try to make a moose attack you for an adrenaline kill.  *** Competitions &amp; Leaderboards Competitions are run around the clock for all animals. Players from around the world sign up and compete against each other. The top players receive a trophy which appears on the player's profile. In addition em$ can be earned. All animals of all players are compared during every season and represented on leaderboards. The best players will make their way into the Hall of Fame.   *** Multiplayer Multiplayer parties are client-based, there are no MP servers. In the game it is possible to chat with others. Players can hunt as team or on their own. It is advisable that people from the same geographical regions connect for such games, or there can be lagging.  *** Things I don't like - The website's style is not 'outdoor-like'. Also the font size and the line spacing are too large. There is a lot of scrolling to be done when going through statistics or the store. - The large antlers of the Red Deer are completely unrealistic. The red deer in the game does not look like the real one, and that is a real pity for me, being European. - Some animals have too large eyes and thus look like large baby animals. The most obvious ones are the Brown Bear and the Roe Deer. - It is not possible to jump or climb over the smallest obstacles and you have to circumvent them. Sometimes it would be handy to climb a rock and gain a bit better overview, but many rocks cannot be climbed.  *** Conclusion The game is constantly being enhanced with new content. It remains one of the best games I have ever played, and certainly played for the longest time. Playing long nights is not tiring even if it gets really busy around you at times. It is unique with its lively environment and ambient sounds, but can be just as much challenging when trying to pin down the trophy animal. There is a great random factor and unpredictability, which I think among many other things is the greatest achievement of the developers. I keep playing because every game session can be so much different to the former, and so the game just never gets old. ",

This investment is only worth it, if you enjoy a slow-paced realistic hunting game with hours of walking around, tracking and preparing. That is not to say that it will take you hours to make your first kill. With some due dilligence, a quarter of an hour is enough to encounter a deer that walks past your sights and gives you the opportunity to collect your first trophy. And that's what makes this game not only good, but at times even masterful. The satisfaction of landing a kill is immense if you spent a lot of work preparing for the perfect shot. If all this appeals to you, TheHunter is a great game. It is beautiful, immersive, dense, packed with wildlife and loads of equipment and weapons to explore; that is, provided you pay for them...",

Sadly, this game, in my opinion, fails at its F2P model. If you actually want to hunt all sorts of animals you will have to invest some money into the game, otherwise, There is only one type of animal that you can hunt.

It does not have a long and hard learing cruve, you have a 'Hunter mate' that can tell you what tracks it is that you just found and tell you where the track is leading. For me it took like 3 - 4 hours to really get the hang of the game.   Now, as a 'free' user you only get to hunt (i think its 2 not sure) 2 animals and you get 2 weapons. You get one hunting reserve that is huge. If you want to play the other 7 reserves and hunt all the 18 animals you need a subscribtion. When i started playing this game i first played as a free user and hunted for 1 hour per day just to see if i enjoyed it that much that i would like to pay for it.   And i did! So i bought the 300kr (29 euros approx) package that gave me 6 months sub, a ♥♥♥♥ tons of weapons and equpiment. When my sub was gone, i still had all my weapons and equimpent left, so i just bought another 3 months for 80kr (8-9 euros) and started to play again.   There is a lot of stuff you can buy ingame, for example callers, baits and camo. I have used the regular outfit for more than a year and been able to hunt in every reserve and any animal with out problem. Its just for looks and making hunting a little bit easier (even though i think its funnier to just follow tracks and shoot them, some perfeer to sit near an open field with a caller and wait for somthing to show up).   Anyway should you get this game? Install it and try as a free user. If you liked it, I recommend the 30 euro package, it gives you (in my opinion) the best rifle and some equipment.  ",

With that said, it's incredible. Two notes on this work -- one, there are few games with better gunplay and two, it is the best hunting game (simulator?) available. theHunter has it all. Unfortunately, most of the content is gated.  Want to hunt mallards? Well, you're going to need to buy a set of decoys, a blind, and a nice shotgun in addition to the license. Win boar hunting tournaments? That demands use of a hog feeder (and the feed), in addition to a tree stand for an optimal experience. And that's the key -- optimal. You do not need anything other than the permitted gun, ammo, and license to hunt a particular animal, HOWEVER, you'll have to work much harder to win competitions or have a successful hunt.  If none of this seems like it will dissuade you, and you've some cash to make your experience easier, it's well worth the value for what you get.",

'Running' because you run like...30% faster than you walk. and you walk really slow...  When i got there i found some poop and a red arrow above it ,wich pointed me to a direction where SOMETHING should have been. After another 10 minutes of following poop trails i finaly found a wild boar.  When i looked through my rifle scope and pointed the animal it said: 'you need a license to hunt this animal'  I couldn't belive it. I shot it anyway to see what happens.  My Bullet didn't do anything..... GREAT!!!!!  So then i found out that you have to BUY the license for REAL MONEY!  The rest of the time i tried to find another animal. I had some sort of 'Deer call noise can' in my inventory but it didn't had any effect what so ever.  So at the end i just rage quit.

While trying to noscope them, they rammed me. My bloodied and bruised rolled down a hill while I was injured. That was fun.    Day three:  :   I spotted a rock. I named him Jim. Jim was a floating rock. He could fly away to the stars if he wanted to. But he didn't want to.    Day four:  :   I found three rabbits - All of which fled like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Edit: i need to clarify, its the best hunting simulator that i have found  BUT this game comes with its choice of issues, and they seem to be becoming more abundant  the more popular the game becomes, for example theres an ongoing issue that started in december of 2015 and is ongoing as of june 2016, where some players are unable to play  some maps as the maps consistantly crash for those players (for example i cant play on  whiterime ridge) all the info we ever get back from this when sending in support requests is 'we are aware of the problem and are working on it'  Alot of the guns in the game are poorly programmed if trying to represent the real life counterpart and the animals dont act like they would in real life, and tend to glitch out in particular instances, such as running into tree's or around in circles.  that being said it is still the best hunting simulator i have found, especially for multiplayer aspects  and i have invested a lot of time and money into this game and do thoroughly enjoy it  it gives an immersive hunting experience, it takes patience and time but can also go on quick 30 min hunts and find animals when knowing where to look   Rating 6.5/10   i do reccomend this game, but only if you have lots of free time on your hands, are willing to invest time and effort in a slow moving game experience (similar to real life hunting) and if wanting to hit the leaderboards or test every item / weapon in the game you will need to invest a  relitively big amount of money for a single game (at current to buy everything in game weapon wise i think it would cost around $1000 and ontop of that there are items you need multiple of to have a good personal setup on a map, such as tents, tree stands, ground blinds etc, and each of those rack up between $1 and $5 each) if you dont want to invest a lot of money into the game you can still have a great time, grab a bow a rifle and a shotgun and you can do anything possible in the game, for the best play experience i reccomend buying the Trailrunner package to start, it costs at current $50 and comes with everything you need to hunt and also 12 months of membership  Edit 2: as of June 15th 2016 the crashes seem to have been sorted out, the only downside of this is to all previous errors or mass game glitches or pretty much anything that made the game unplayable for a time the players were rewarded in some way, be it either added membership time to cover the time of the game being unplayable or a free in store item, generally a unique item related to the issue or latest patch. How ever it seems that this time because the issues lasted multiple months (almost 5 months total) they may be working on what to give the players as compensation, but if not it is currently 5 months since the game was boarderline unplayable and there has just been a fix for the crashes and so far no compensation i will keep this review updated.",

This alone demands that a certain demographic -- those not looking for a hunting arcade shooter where animals pop up every ten seconds -- take notice.  Yes, it costs for a yearly license to shoot every animal in the game. And yes, there are new free animals available for hunt, rotated every two weeks. My suggestion to a new hunter just starting out would be to find what animals are free, then go after them to see if you like the game enough to pay fora license.  And yes, weapons cost money, as do callers, clothes, and everything else in the game. This is a part of what makes it a great game, in my opinion. There's a sense of ownership and challenge when you purchase a new weapon and bring it out into the field. Leveling up a weapon is actually fun when you know you've just paid for it. I've been in the game for years now and do not own every weapon in the game, nor do I need to: I've had a blast leveling up the ones I do have, and I am nowhere near to mastery with any save the pump shotgun.  To trash this masterpiece because of its aggressive business model is a real shame. For my part, I am happy to continue to support the devs with my money because they're constantly adding new things.  Bottom line: if you want a hunting sim, here's the best available to you.",

The downside to free to play? You can't host your own online hunting server/lobby. Your clothes are your enemy forcing you to have to either crouch-walk or sit still.  Pay To Play/Membership: There is great benefits with becoming a Member of the Evergreen.

When buying Membership purchase through the TheHunter website to prevent issues caused by Steam. ( This isn't a must as not everyone has issues but there has been enough people posting about it on the TheHunter FB Page that warrants informing. )  The Game Itself: It displays remarkable realism, Making it a one of a kind. When you get tired of hunting you can always go sightseeing as it masters the beauty of the land and while you're out there you can snap pictures of what you come across and share them.  For those that like achievements/leaderboards(maxing out), You will find countless hours worth of achievements in this game. However, This is no cheap endeavor and could be a game breaker. You'll need to buy every weapon that's released current and future. 5K EM$ costs $43.99, You'll be spending well over $250 dollars.  There's endless amounts of fun to have, From the cold Artic of WhiteRime stalking the thunder beast, To the Forests of Settlers Creek luring in a massive Bull Elk, To the Swamps of Rougarou making it sound like World War III shooting down Mallard Ducks with all of your friends.",

There's a huge paywall to really get into the game but that wall typically only comes if you like it enough to spend money on it.

You won't get the full experience but you'll be able to preview the meat of the gameplay, which is what this game is all about.  If you don't have a lot of free time there is no gameplay whatsoever. However, if you're patient enough to just sit back and immerse yourself for a while with the occasional distraction, you'll find the deepest hunting game out there. It's pretty much just like real hunting. You walk to a good spot or find and track signs of an animal. Then you carefully set up a shot and shoot it. There's a thrill to findind a big buck, grizzly bear, or a huge flock of fowl coming your way. Shooting it is a challenge, and pulling off a clean kill is rewarding. Adding it to your ever-growing list of kills and trophy-shots is merely the aftertaste of a good hunt.  As for the pay to play element, if you like the demo but don't want to spend a ton of money then drop some cash on a basic membership, a universal gun, and some camo. Expect to spend about $30~40 dollars if you really like the experience and want to play a lot for a few months.  TL;DR, if you want authentic hunting, this is it.

Such as draw distance for long range shots. and alot of the time when you hear an animal call it sounds like it is coming from the left. But shows up on your right on the huntermate 'GPS/Tracker' Also the fact that other people cant place larger items like bait barrels tents tree stands etc on a server and only the host can is disappointing. :(  But @ the moment i cant get enough of this game. but would love them to extend the draw distance for long range shooting as the graphics are superb on max abd allowing other people to place items like tree stands in a map'But returned them to the player once server shut's down' would be great.   love it aside from the above. :) ",

Part of the game is free to play...but the best way to experience theHunter is to get a membership pack like the (Trailrunner Starter Pack) because you'll get a lot of really good gear and a 1 year membership that will let you hunt every animal on every reserve in the game with unlimited ammo for all your weapons as long as your a member (but you always get free ammo for the .243 starter rifle even if your not a member). Now this would keep any hunter busy for a long time as it is, but the development team is hard at work on new stuff (new animals, reserves, guns, bows, camo, stands/blinds and callers) and updates are released all the time. With the constant development and the massive amount of already available content in this game I would say that theHunter is one on the best buys on Steam, and it lets the player pick what they want and how much to spend or not to spend on the game. I hope this review gives anyone that's thinking of giving this game a shot the confidence to take the plunge, because it's really worth it...especially if you like hunting and the outdoors.",

I have made good friends within the community and enjoyed thousands of hours in this game.  General characteristics of the game: The Hunter is a game trying to find a balance between a realistic simulator and a fun game. It is not fast paced and it might take some time before you understand the mechanics of the game. You can play in any way you want; some people focus on winning competitions or getting on the general leaderboards, others enjoy luring in birds or just walking around in a reserve, tracking and calling for the animals they love to hunt.  Downloading this game for free will give you very limited options, you will recieve a weapon that only allows you to hunt 1 species. However, if you are willing to pay for some licenses and gear, you can hunt all of the species you like and use the weapons you are fond of. The achievement system depends on the animals you shoot, and the weapons you use. Killing animals and using different weapons gives you HunterScore, which is the basis for your position on the leaderboards. If you wish to have all the weapons, it will cost you a lot of money. However there are some great bundles that give you good weapons and permission to hunt all species in the game. Buying licenses for specific species is something I would advise against. If you buy membership packs, you get permission to shoot all species for a certain time + some nice weapons and gear. Furthermore, this game has two types of current EM$ and GM$; the EM$ can only be bought with real money and allows you to buy everything in the store, the GM$ is earned by doing missions and special events, and can be used buy consumables that improve your game or a special shotgun.   If you are thinking about buying things from the ingame store, don't hesitate to message me on steam, I can give you some advice on what to buy.   Pros: - There are many different species (A-typical and rare colored animals can be found [albino, melanistic etc.] ) - There are many different weapons (incl. rifles, handguns, bows. Modern and old)  - Very nice reserves - Good graphics - Many competitions in which you can compete with fellow hunters - It's challenging - It will keep you off the streets for years if you enjoy it - Frequent updates - Many special events (Holidays with special competitions and store discounts!) - Many great people in the community - A very active forum, where all your questions can be answered   Cons: - It has bugs, it often takes a long time before they are fixed (Some of these have been around for a long time) - Server is down a few times every month for a few minutes to a few hours - It's expensive if you want to have a lot of gear - Very limited options for character customisation  Cheers, Gierenhart (Grafzerk in theHunter) ",

            "review_text": "*Please give this a read*   So, I had just taken a peek at the reviews for this game to see if others had been enjoying it as much as I have, and I was shocked with all the negatives there were.   A lot of the negative responses I saw were complaints on the fact that the game itself isn't really free to play or that it's pay to win. But you're playing the full game, you're just limited to what you can hunt, which is Mule Deer. Now, that doesn't sound like a whole lot, and it really isn't in comparison to what else the game has to offer. But I spent a solid 3 hours straight tracking and hunting mule deer and having a blast.   I quickly realized that this game was well worth shelling out some money for. The terrain is gorgeous, the way all of the animals behave is very realistic, the tracking keeps me very interested in the hunt and the overall experience is just amazing.   To those of you who were looking for a free hunting game with lots of guns and animals to shoot, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but this isn't it. The free part is just a demo really of the full game where you can hunt mule deer and get that taste.    But if you're looking for a great hunting game and are willing to drop 30-40 bucks on a bundle that gives you 12 months of unlimited hunting, a 12 gauge shotgun(comes with all different types of shot to hunt everything), a new stronger rifle with a new scope, a .44 and .357 revolver, some better camo'd clothes, some calls and a few other goodies, then this is definitely the game for you.   Seriously, if you enjoy the experience of just hunting the mule deer for a bit, drop some money into it and go for the full experience, it's really worth it. This game deserves to be paid for.  9/10 (Only because of microtransactions with all the rest of the items that don't come in a bundle, but none of that other stuff is actual stuff that's needed to enjoy the game and have the full experience)",

This is easily the best hunting sim I have ever played. Its beautiful, the maps are huge and there are many of them with another being added very soon. The animal behavior is excellent. Probably the best 'enemy' AI that I have seen in any game. There is a wide variety of weapons to choose from.   The leveling system does a great job of progression. It really makes you feel like you are getting better as a hunter. For example, the more tracks you read, the more information you can get about the animal you are tracking and the more accurate that information becomes.  The community is fantastic. It isn't a huge community, but there are always multiplayer games open, and those games are often hosted by higher ranked players who open their games to share the resources they have invested. Treestands, fast-travel tents, bear and hog feeders, goose and duck setups etc. There is also a lot to be said about the comraderie of MP games. Its always nice to get positive feedback from someone when you harvest a nice scoring animal.  For me, the best part of theHunter are the competitions and missions. Competitions usually last just a couple of days. There are cosmetic trophies and often in game currency rewards for placing in the top 3. The missions and competitions add just a little bit of focus to your hunts. Gives you a sense of purpose rather than just wandering around looking for animals to shoot (not that this isn't fun by itself).  theHunter is among my favorite games of all time. I have never bothered to write a review before, but I don't want people to miss the opportunity to play this fantastic game after being put off by reviews. You can definately spend some money to enhance your playing experience, but beyond getting a membership to be able to hunt all the animals, its not necessary to spend a lot of money.",

This game is a complete moneytrap, and I refuse to put more money into it. I have played it for around 6 hours, and after buying membership, have only been able to get a total of 4 legit kills.

For example: If you are a free player the ONLY things you start off with is a Mule Deer licence and a Cottontail Rabbit licence, the most basic rifle, a deer caller and a camera (which isn't needed for anything). The ONLY way of unlocking new things (licences, weapons, etc.) is by purchasing membership, purchasing in-game currency or completing HUNDREDS of hunter missions. I say hundreds because nearly everything you can buy using the 'free' currency (which you earn from completing missions) costs thousands and you only earn a hundred or so from missions. So, in reality, it isn't a free game because the main features require payment. This review was based entirely on a free-to-play point of view, I haven't and won't purchase membership or in-game currency. However, I presume this game is very good if you're willing to pay for the experience.",

I have spent over 200+ hours playing this and combining that with my real life hunting experience, it has become a very enjoyable game. Set aside the fact that you must invest $25-$30 just to start getting more enjoyment out, it starts getting better, especially if you find a good hunting buddy. If you do not have the patience to sit in a treestand or blind waiting for a deer for a couple of minutes, then you are better off going back to COD. Notice the game name is The Hunter not The Shooter, if all you did was start up the game load up your gear and instantly find something to kill, there would be no point. I love how they made this game as realistic as possible and i understand the frustration about the in-game currency but you have to understand no 'free to play' game is ever really free, there wouldnt be a profit to be made, so to all of you out there that are used to just getting handed everything and not really earning it, turn away now and keep scrolling cause this isnt the game for you. To all those that are looking for a great hunting game that is better than the cabela's games that are basically the arcade shooters from the bowling alley, then you have found the right game.",

Who know….there are games I have on Steam which I have completed in a few months and probably will not re-install.  12 months is a long period of game time so I have no problem with this setup.  So what is the game like?  For starters the game is the most beautiful and detailed world I have seen….sun splitting the trees, then the rain comes on and the world around you dulls down. I constantly get over 80fps on my GTX 880m laptop and it is a pleasure to look at. Tree textures and undergrowth are highly detailed and provide a lot of camouflage.  The animal models seem very good (from what I have seen so far) and the sounds a lot to the gameplay/environment.  I really enjoy this game and love the slow pace…………don’t expect to be running around at high speeds and shooting animals, Call of Duty style, this is not the game for you.

Hunt  You can find 18 different animals in the game, sub or no sub, but your guns are intelligent enough to hold their fire if you even dare to shoot something you don't have the license for.

Personally, I think that's ok.... but why the... do i have to be a member to invite my bro/friend/gf to play the same server as me.   In the game there are 2 types of currency: EM and GM. Em is real money. Gm is the game money which you can earn it from mission and mission only. Speaking of mission, there is very little you can do as 1 mission is 100 Gm-200gm(as far as i get to ) and the mission is very limited which requires you to finish the mission above you in order to start new mission. Now back to currency, Em you can buy anything, however with the Gm you can't buy ♥♥♥♥; no new weapons, no new lures, no new license...etc. And, the rate where you get GM is very slow process that it will take almost a month to earn 1 license for 1 day or 7 days depends on your schedule. Although, you can earn EM through surveys; however, i wouldn't recommand you do those surveys as people have reported virus/scam thus leaving  thehunter.com  to tweet '@mrcgames1 We don't manage those surveys, but if there was a virus in one of them, please let us know which and we'll ask to take it down.' Also forgot to mention, sometime surveys will not work.   However, gameplays very shine. Oh, the animial that you tracked and finally killed is an awesome feeling. You have to play it in order to experience it.  In conclusion, game is not a true F2P, thus not recommended for cheap people like me and for those who have money to burn: Welcome to theHunter. As for do i recommend this game? I would not because this game info is misleading; instead of F2P, it is more like Free to Demo. OK Grammar Nazis ... I Am Ready To Go With You Guys.",

Of course, you can learn to play the game *without* knowing how to hunt, but it will take a few hours. Now, to the gameplay: I'd give it a 4/10. The first gun you get is a simple one shot .243 bolt action. The gun must always be raised from hip to shoulder, and then you look down the scope/iron sights to fire. There is no such thing as hip-fire. There are no vehicles and it's a large world. Your character moves slow as hell. But, graphics get a solid 7/10. They're not the best, but damn they look good. Realism I'd give a 9.5/10. The game's gameplay is mainly so low BECAUSE of Realism being so up there. You wouldn't exactly walk around everywhere where there could be other hunters with your gun pointed straight ahead. Neither would you move very fast if you're trying to be stealthy (Still doesn't excuse slow running rate!) Straight to the point, the game would get a 5/10 in my opinion. It's got potential, but it's not quite there yet. Still, worth the time to play, if you don't mind chasing a deer for a half an hour for ONE kill",

Additional items such as weapons, species licenses and ammo can be acquired with gm$, the in-game currency that can be earned through play, or em$, the in-game currency that can be earned through winning competitions or purchase for real money. ' No game is ever truly 'free to play', the company must somehow recompense the capital they have put into developing and/ or running a game - usually there are shops where you can buy premium goods for real money and/ or a subscription model that allows more full access to features - theHunter is no different!  For free you can hunt mule deer all day long on one reserve ... yes, there are other animals on this reserve which you are unable to hunt without a license however, if you complete the mule deer missions you will quickly start earning gm$ (the in-game currency) with which you can buy licenses for the other animals ... my advise would be if you want to play this game for free then focus on mule deer missions earn some gm$, then buy licenses for 1 species at a time &amp; do as many missions for those as possible.  If however, you can afford to subscribe (which is actually very reasonable), you will be free to hunt whatever you wish as long as you are able to hunt the species with the weapon you have! I and a number of friends have played many, many hours on this game &amp; we continue to love it!  For me personally I would give the game 9/10 - it is something that I initially downloaded to troll a friend who played, and upon playing I totally fell in love with it &amp; now have a higher Hunter score :P",

If you could buy this game for 60 bucks and have access to everything via in game currency or through some sort of progression system this would be a great hunting game. Instead, they chose to make this the absolute worst implementation of a F2P game ever. You get 1 gun and can hunt 2 animals to start, however, you can really only hunt 1 since the 2 animal you have a license for requires a different gun. That's right each animal requires a license and specific gun all of which costs real money. This game has been turned into a system designed to milk as much money from you as possbile. Licenses, guns, clothes, lure, equipment, and consumables all require real money if you want them the only thing you can get with the in game money is ammo. You can get in game money or gm by completing mission, once again however, some of the mission require you to use a different gun which costs you real money.  So in closing this game would be a great game 8/10 or so if it had an upfront cost and then require you to progress through the game to unlock equipment, guns, etc. Whoever decided that this F2P system was a good thing needs to be fired ...... out of a cannon ...... into the sun.  1/10 because of the F2P nonsense.",

It's upsetting to see this title handled like this, when the actually quality of the full experience in actually not that bad earning between a 6.5 and 7.5 in my opinion With decent visuals, expansive map, a good selection of animals, guns and hunting tools, make it a surprisingly decent hunting simulator compared to its competitors......but, and it's a big BUT, the cost associated with the full experience is pretty ridiculous. Subscriptions, starter packs, and micro transactions gate off pretty much all of this game's content behind a rather dauntingly high pay wall for the average player. This game would be better served as a one time payment game of maybe $20-$30 where you could experience all the content. With poor optimization, almost all content locked, multiplayer restrictions, and some serious but not game breaking gameplay flaws throughout, this title has absolutely no god damn right to ask for the amount of money you'd need to spend to experience it. A decent hunting simulator, ruined so it can be exploited as a cash grab.",

Instead of giving me the same items over they could have given a backpack and/or holster for my purchase plus some starter in game premium coin. To add insult to injury, the game lacks any sort of serious gameplay. This game needs the patience of a saint, even worse, once you get into the game no only is your kills not worth anything unless its based on a mission but the ones you do get don't give much to begin with... This games need a little more thought as to what players get, not only for their dollar but also for their time and effort. 4 hours for 1 mule deer even for a beginner is not worth my time specially when you get nothing in return for that mule deer.

For new players that are sure to spend many hours on this game I would recommend buying the 'pathfinder' and 'callers' bundle directly. It offers enough content to play endless hours and it remains a reasonnable price to put into the game. Everything else is optional and it's your choice whether you want that fancy camouflage or gun.    ",

With that said, this is one of the greatest games I've ever played. Yes, it's freemium. Yes, that's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ business model. But if you put the same amount of money into this game as you would a normal game, you will not have any difficulties at all.  My background is in MMOs and Co-op games. I got tired of the survivalist zombie games, as the market is absolutely flooded with them from every direction now. theHunter adds an entirely new spin on survivalist. You don't actually die, but you still have purpose. Whether you want to just mindlessly hone your skills at something, do missions, or competitions, there's always something to waste time with.  After spending several hours playing, I totally expected to write a fully satirical review of the game. I, instead, fell in love with it.",

            "review_text": "  theHunter has always amazed me within it's visual experience. This game will make you feel like an actual hunter, but it has its downsides.  The game gives you a free rotation of animals to hunt (with three/two permanent hunts), a gun that can kill every animal within 'permits', an ability to buy winter clothes, and lures/scents, and some other things. There are many items within this game though, Dogs, Bows, More Guns, Ammo, everything you need to hunt. But you can't buy it. You can not 'earn' money to buy these items.  There are two types of currency, em$ and gm$.  Em$ is currency bought with real-time money, or earned through surveys. Gm$ is currency earned through mission completion, tournaments, etc.  Now, using that currency, you can only buy around 20 items out of a ♥♥♥♥ ton with Gm$.  (Lures/Scents, 1 gun, 1 type of ammo, basic artic clothes) Meaning, about 90% of the other items in the marketplace have to be bought with REAL MONEY.  The game gives you no 'ability' to earn these amazing items.   TheHunter is a great game, like I stated above. But it is based to get the most money possible. It averages about 1,000 players a day, and that is probably dropping.  The game is reviewed negatively by many people that play it, but the game itself is actually dope as heck.  I am recommending this game to others, but I hope the developers change the store of theHunter.  Everyone should have a chance for something, It's not good if 90% of the store is 'Real money only'.

The Hunter is an absolutely gorgeous game, so far the best in simulating a real hunting enviroment. You need patience, Skill and a good eye.  Now to the oh so hated 'High Price' of the game:  If you're interested in the hunting part and not so much which weapon you're hunting with, You can lay down as little as 14,99 USD for 3 months of membership ( Which allows you to do everything in the game ) and recieve the following guns :   12 Gauge Single Shot Shotgun 12 Gauge Pump Action Shotgun 357. Revolver  And an assortment of Clothing , Callers , and Scopes for your weapons.  The shotgun alone allows you to hunt every single animal in this game.  So summary of the price ? 14.99 Gets you to the full game for 3 months.    ",

I would recommend that the game should be put out as a FREE DEMO. That would at least stop all these childish 'Reviews' done by kids who don't have any money to support the developers. Within the first 10 minutes of exploring this game you can tell that a lot of people put a lot of hard work into the amazing details of the enviornment. Even the details in the audio are spectacular. The gunshots sound LOUD and realistic.  You start off with a handheld device that maps your hike and allows you to identify various animal trackings such as hoof/paw prints and droppings as well as audio callings. You can track one animal at a time by finding these track domes throughout the wilderness. Once you started tracking one of these animals you will follow a brighter traking dome trail with the freedom to switch trails whenever you wish. A lot of times, while you're tracking a mule deer, you will hear a different deer calling as you get closer to them and you have the option to switch tracks and start tracking this closer deer. That is a nice feature to the hunt, because I have spent hours tracking a single deer, determined to get this specific deer only to find that I've made a mile long circle through the woods. That can happen in real life though, so I'm not too frustrated with it.   My advice is, check it out and track a couple mule deer. You may really like the layout of the game. If you do, great, find an upgrade package that works for you or just explore the vast wilderness and keep tracking mule deer for free, or track other animals and take pictures of them instead of killing them. I wouldn't mind paying $50 to play this massive game for a single year. If you try the game and don't like it, what did it cost you besides some time and hard drive space? Chances are you will enjoy this game if you're really looking for a good hunting game. Just look at it as a DEMO, not a F2P.",

            "review_text": "FAIR WARNING: THERE WILL NOT BE A TL,DR TO THIS REVIEW. I am not a beginner at the game, nor have I been playing it for years. I am writing this from a 'I have been playing this for a month or two' perspective.  I am going to try to write a serious, honest review about this game. This game is not Free-to-Play. Do not think that it is. It is free to download, however. Although, to have a positive experience in this program, you will NEED to invest in the game. At the bottom of this review will be what I reccomend you invest in, in order, to have a legitimate, enjoyable experience with the game.  Now, I'm gonna explain the game.  At the very start of the game, you are allowed to kill three species of animals: Mule Deer, Pheasants, and Cottontail Rabbits. You also get one firearm: a .243 caliber bolt-ation rifle. This rifle, however, can only LEGALLY kill one of the animals I have listed, meaning you can only get a real score from Mule Deer. The .243 rifle is simply too powerful to qualify for pheasants and rabbits. At the very start, you can only successfully hunt one species.  Now, you can either go the F2P-grind route, or the 'I'll pitch in a few bucks' route. If you choose to be Purely F2P, you will be forced to do missions and receive gm$ to advance in the game. With gm$ you can buy consumables, and one firearm on the market: a crappy single-shot-shotgun, along with individual licenses. Now, to DO these mission, you will need licenses to kill animals in the mission, which probably cost 700gm$ EACH. FOR SEVEN DAYS. AND THERE ARE PROBABLY MULTIPLE ANIMALS TO KILL IN EACH MISSION. NOT TO MENTION 700GM$ IS ALREADY WORTH MORE THAN COMPLETING JUST ONE MISSION. Trying to play the F2P will just be like bending over backwards. You're stuck with bad guns, it's a grind, and guess what? There is no mission looping. If you plan to thrive off of just missions and buying ♥♥♥♥ with just gm$, eventually you will have to pay EIGHT DOLLARS to reset all missions just so you can continue being 'F2P'.   Now, if you have a few dollars to spare, and I mean this, the game becomes enjoyable. The game is fun. Especially when you have friends to hunt with. It becomes a game of coordination, technique, and risk. And you know what? Once you buy firearms, they are there forever, but only as a member will you have infinite ammo. So after you pitch in as much money as you feel satisfied with, you only need to buy new memberships as long as you feel like you enjoy the game.  All in all, 'Is it a good game?' Yes. I enjoy it a lot. Why? I don't know. Something about it is pleasurable. It isnt the most visually appealing, but when you spot a crazy looking deer and you nail it in the heart, there is a sense of satifsaftion that you will get that you don't recieve on an everyday basis. I reccomend this game because of the things like that that happen in-game. Also, there is a certain level of variety in the antler system of all animals that piques my interest. I don't know, the antler system is interesting. Random generation is fun, right?  Get it, put a couple bucks in, enjoy this game. It is definitely fun.  Now here's the shopping list:  1. Wayfarer bundle (NOT OFF STEAM) Includes a nice shotgun (can legally kill anything in the game), includes a three month membership, a .357 which is basically a lighter-weight .243, a hat(non-significant), and a turkey caller. 15$ 2. A 'Parker-Python' bow. Silent, one of the most fun mechanics in the game is bowhunting. Doesn't spook animals, can also kill every animals in the game, and effectively. $7. 3. A set of clothes that protects against all deer species. This should be bought in a bundle. Trapper, Army clothing, Doc Mosignor, or B&amp;C Bundle. $6.84 4. Some callers, to lure in animals. depending on which you choose to buy: $1.30-$2 each. One of the most valuable buys in the game. --- At this point these buys are just to put more money in the funnel, but these are the more valuable things you should purchase if you have money to burn.  7mm Magnum Bullpup Rifle--$6 Rangefinder scope for bow mention earlier (SO USEFUL)--$3.50 .22 Plinkington Rifle--$5.50 x3-x9 scope for both rifles mentioned--$3.50  OK. Shopping list over. Good game. 8.5/10 if there was a better economy, but 5/10 for being a mugging simulator.",

This rifle, however, can only LEGALLY kill one of the animals I have listed, meaning you can only get a real score from Mule Deer. The .243 rifle is simply too powerful to qualify for pheasants and rabbits. At the very start, you can only successfully hunt one species.  Now, you can either go the F2P-grind route, or the 'I'll pitch in a few bucks' route. If you choose to be Purely F2P, you will be forced to do missions and receive gm$ to advance in the game. With gm$ you can buy consumables, and one firearm on the market: a crappy single-shot-shotgun, along with individual licenses. Now, to DO these mission, you will need licenses to kill animals in the mission, which probably cost 700gm$ EACH. FOR SEVEN DAYS. AND THERE ARE PROBABLY MULTIPLE ANIMALS TO KILL IN EACH MISSION. NOT TO MENTION 700GM$ IS ALREADY WORTH MORE THAN COMPLETING JUST ONE MISSION. Trying to play the F2P will just be like bending over backwards. You're stuck with bad guns, it's a grind, and guess what? There is no mission looping. If you plan to thrive off of just missions and buying ♥♥♥♥ with just gm$, eventually you will have to pay EIGHT DOLLARS to reset all missions just so you can continue being 'F2P'.   Now, if you have a few dollars to spare, and I mean this, the game becomes enjoyable. The game is fun. Especially when you have friends to hunt with. It becomes a game of coordination, technique, and risk. And you know what? Once you buy firearms, they are there forever, but only as a member will you have infinite ammo. So after you pitch in as much money as you feel satisfied with, you only need to buy new memberships as long as you feel like you enjoy the game.  All in all, 'Is it a good game?' Yes. I enjoy it a lot. Why? I don't know. Something about it is pleasurable. It isnt the most visually appealing, but when you spot a crazy looking deer and you nail it in the heart, there is a sense of satifsaftion that you will get that you don't recieve on an everyday basis. I reccomend this game because of the things like that that happen in-game. Also, there is a certain level of variety in the antler system of all animals that piques my interest. I don't know, the antler system is interesting. Random generation is fun, right?  Get it, put a couple bucks in, enjoy this game. It is definitely fun.  Now here's the shopping list:  1. Wayfarer bundle (NOT OFF STEAM) Includes a nice shotgun (can legally kill anything in the game), includes a three month membership, a .357 which is basically a lighter-weight .243, a hat(non-significant), and a turkey caller. 15$ 2. A 'Parker-Python' bow. Silent, one of the most fun mechanics in the game is bowhunting. Doesn't spook animals, can also kill every animals in the game, and effectively. $7. 3. A set of clothes that protects against all deer species. This should be bought in a bundle. Trapper, Army clothing, Doc Mosignor, or B&amp;C Bundle. $6.84 4. Some callers, to lure in animals. depending on which you choose to buy: $1.30-$2 each. One of the most valuable buys in the game. --- At this point these buys are just to put more money in the funnel, but these are the more valuable things you should purchase if you have money to burn.  7mm Magnum Bullpup Rifle--$6 Rangefinder scope for bow mention earlier (SO USEFUL)--$3.50 .22 Plinkington Rifle--$5.50 x3-x9 scope for both rifles mentioned--$3.50  OK. Shopping list over. Good game. 8.5/10 if there was a better economy, but 5/10 for being a mugging simulator.",

If you want to actually test the game's central mechanics, you need to buy one of the 'starter' packs. These packs aren't actually starter packs, but monthly subscriptions that you need to keep buying into in order to continue playing the game. I am not opposed to the concept of buying games. I've bought many games, some of them good, some of them bad. However, none of them pretended to be a free-to-play game and locked off the core features of the game. Other common game practices are also missing, like being able to change video quality from the game's pause menu instead of from the launcher / main menu.  I downloaded this game with a friend to see what all the negative fuss was about, and now I understand. The community for this game acts as though paying for functionality for a free-to-play game is typical. There are fantastic free-to-play titles that allow for progression, or even being able to play the base game at all, without spending any amount of money at all. These games understand what the term 'free-to-play' means. This game is pay-to-win in that you can't even access the mechanic the game is centered around. Had this been advertised as a forest walking simulator with the ability to fire a non-lethal weapon, maybe I could understand how functionality is behind a paywall. However, the game is called 'theHunter' and is labeled as free-to-play, yet you can't do any hunting without paying a minimum of $15.  I don't even like hunting games.",

After that you can buy things for small transactions and spend about 10 dollars for 3 month membership, if you still want to play this game you need to buy more membership.  In my opinion however, they should add a full price of 60$ for 10 guns, 15 equipment of your shoosing and unlimited ammo and unlimited licence. This is because dedicated fans are forced to pay over and over again for licence they sometimes don't even use.  Overall. 10/10 - graphics, sound, realism and hunting experience. 5/10 - paying methoids, semi false advertisement, punishing dedicated membership players.  For those who say 'pay 2 win' it isn't since you can do well just by playing well with any gun in the game. For more advanced species like goose you might need a blind or something like that but you can always join a multiplayer game and use other peoples equipment. ",

I dont have enough patience to play the game properly so i cant blame the game on that, however instead of a pay-to-win situation, its a pay-to-play game. You can only hunt 3 types of animals in the game, a pheasant , a hog, and a type of deer, which you rarely see in the world. For everything else you need a 'License' to shoot, meaning you need to pay money per month. Trying to shoot it wont do anything as your gun wont fire. Plus, even if you shoot an animal which you can shoot, you need the right type of gun, which you never have, and need to buy. However, I will say the game is sortof pretty graphics-wise, not up close though.",

I am playing as guest rigth now, and enjoying it. With time, your skills and knowledge will grow and it will become easier to hunt, without paying anything.  CON  You have to pay for stuff like callers, lures, stands, clothes!, weapons and even ammo. And it's very expensive. There is in-game cunnency, but it is hard to get and it's very limited what you can buy with it (consumeables).  I understand, why it costs so much, as the game is not for everyone. These kind of games will always have a smaller community, but the creators still have to make a living. I understand that. I am just waiting for discounts i would like.

The Hunter is amazing, but not very noob friendly. Basically as a free player you can only hunt 2 types of animals (and you don't have the correct weapon/ammo to hunt one of those types). When I began playing the game didn't tell me this or let me know where I should hunt and what I could hunt for that matter. After some frustrating hours of running around I figured it out and started hunting Mule Deer. I did this for a few days until I got tired of hunting the same animal over and over again. I really enjoyed the game though, so I saved up money to buy the 12 month subscription and more importantly get a bow to hunt with. I've had a lot of fun with the game since then and I look forward to playing even more in the future.  There is one problem though, and it's a big one. The pricing is ridiculous. Every single weapon in the game costs money and the same goes for items, equipment and clothes. The subscription packages sets you up with some decent starting equipment, but it's really too bad that you have to pay more money to try out other hunting possibilities. Personally I think it would work better if you were able to earn currency to buy all these things for for every animal you harvest, because the current missions are way too slow for this. A system similar to that seen in Mass Effect 3's multiplayer where you can buy crates with random goodies would also be a great way to introduce players to the game. But again this is only if players were able to gain ingame currency faster than what the current solution offers.  This is all just my opinion though. I will enjoy my subscription while it lasts, but I will not be re-subscribing when it runs out. I don't feel that I get enough for my money.",

This will basicly unlock the full game for you. Then you get to track, spot, compete, shoot, do whatever within, not getting nagged about micropayments.  The user reviews saying 'mostly negative' is BS because they are mostly from ADHD kids who want to shoot and kill from the second the game starts. This game is ment for players with bit of patience to find, track, spot and shoot your prey. Again, the game is not free to play, it just gives you access to see the game world and nothing else, so prepare to pay 15€ if you really wanna get into this.  Its a fun game, the maps look awesome, guns are detailed and vary nicely from each other. Plus the creators are updating the game, so there are more maps, weapons and feature to come in the future.  Really nice game if you wanna shoot something but not feeling to play one of those boring and repeating COD/BF/ETC. bulk FPS games.",

But do know this... if you are not a patient person, you will not enjoy this game as I literally spent 6 hours tracking a group of deers over 10 KM (Got 5 of em and wounded 1-2 BTW :3). And the tracking system is amazing to me with the different tracks there are and the noises you can triangulate, though at running speed in this game you only got at 4 m/s so have fun. But one complaint is the fact that there is this massive paywall which is a huge turn off for me, with all these annoying license's you havee to get with in game money which is hard to earn, if they could make it so you can pull in animals and get money from them instead of just challenges that would be amazing,  Only tip for new player's that I have is trust your instincts, I know that sounds cliched but trust me it helps.",

This is a SIMULATOR, not simply a game.  I do think that theHunter is due for a graphical improvement. While it is still beautiful on its highest settings, it is now starting to just lag behind what systems are capable of. The graphics were impressive for 2009-2010, but I really do feel it is time for a polish up.   All in all, an excellent simulator, and a still beautiful, immersive environment. A 9/10 from me.",

You should feel obligated to do so, when getting enjoyment out of something that has taken years of hard work and an amazing dedication to the community to create.

Normal people don't have the money to be paying for a membership. I'll give you credit for the fact that you get to have a free trial, but this should be a one and done game. Charge $20-50 like every other game and be done. It would be a smarter approach too. Sure, you might be luring in a few suckers with your current tactics, but you would be getting a lot more paying players with my approach. And a lot more good reviews too, which means drawing in even more people.   While we're at it, knock off having to pay real money for every perk in-game too. You're already making people pay for a membership, but now you're forcing them to pay for perks in order for them to be a successful player? Instead, you should have a system where players can earn $em through kills in-game. The amount of payout would depend upon how the animal was killed, and how much the animal is worth. That would be a positive way to encourage players to work towards a goal while being entertained at the same time. If they're impatient or lazy, there's always the option to buy $em with real money. That way you'd still be getting paid.  In conclusion, it's a decent game and I'll probably continue playing it here and there, but it's not worth spending that much money on.",

If you were expecting to not have to at least pay for something in a Free-to-play game then no offense you're stupid. Other games may not have memberships but they will still make you pay for something, besides what's the difference from paying for a membership in an MMO? It's practically the same thing. Besides for all the people complaing 'walked around for 30 mins and couldn't find anything' are the people who didn't go through the tutorial or at least ask for help from other players.

A 'game' is when you can experience the whole in-game-experience... and in fact this doesn't occur with this specif case. For 'free' you are only allowed to hunt 2 different species, and this screws, IN MY OPINION, the game. I don't expect, like people say, that this I think it should be intirelly free... but I don't consider fair that I should pay real money for a membership that lasts a X number of months... or to pay real money to have differente weapons or different equipment.... My opinion is that this should be made as a regular game where you buy with a fix 'price tag', and I even would accept some weapons or equipment to be payed on the side... but this 'engine' screw's up the game-experience...  For this I don't recomend the game for any person who is looking for a very good free-to-play game, but I highly recomend to any gamer who is looking for a very-good title on the 'simulator' rank.",

            "review_text": "this is another game that's fallen victim to the f2p model done incorrectly. they use what i can only describe as an extortionist version of f2p. that's honestly the best way i can describe it.   the game is quite expansive, there are a deccent number of maps, a fantastic number of animals to hunt, and a good number of weapons and accessories to use. there's about a dozen maps, 2 dozen or more animals, a dozen guns, and tons of accessories from scents, to tents, to calls, to ammo, scopes, etc. LOTS of content in this game. here's what you have access to as a free player. 1 gun, 2 animals, 2 maps, 1 call. that's it. you can grind the in game currency by hunting those 2 starter animals and then use the currency to buy temprorary licenses to hunt other animals. the grind is unbearable. especially when you factor in the fact that on the free maps, the 2 animals you can hunt are fairly rare. it takes a long time to find a track for either one of those animals.   ok but let's say you're ok with paying money. you take a look at their packages, ranging from a respectable 10 dollars up to 50 bucks. ok fine i don't mind shelling out 10 bucks. but low and behold once you do shell out the 10 bucks you dont get access to anything other then licenses to kill all the animals and access to all the maps. you can't get any new clothes unless you spend money, guns? spend money, ammo? spend money, calls? spend money, tents? spend money. virtually EVERYWHERE you turn you have to spend money.    look the bottomline is, if you're ok with shelling out 100-200$+ for this game, it's a good hunting game with multiplayer features. but understand that at every turn in this game if there's something you need access to to play this game, you have to pay for it.   for comparison, imagine if you were playing league of legends or dota, except you're only given access to 5 hero's, and if you ever want to play new ones without paying money you have to grind out hours and hours of work to get temporary access to a new hero. you can pay but then the game becomes a monthly subscription. and with that in mind this game is NOT worth a monthly subscription. sorry it just plain isn't. you could buy deer hunter for 20 bucks and get nearly the same experience. there are many stand alone hunting games that are comparable to this game and those games dont' require hundreds of dollars to access the full game.   look i know f2p models are great for squeezing money out of excited players. but you're not going to expand your player base by crippling your game, ♥♥♥♥ even in the old days of freeware games they gave you more access to their game then this. you've got less then 10% of this game to try. this game is basically freeware, except with even less access then old DOS freeware games.  as for the recent surge of positive reviews, the dev's of this game made a post in the game's launcher talking about how they saw too many negative reviews of this game. so the players of this game went all white knight and trie dto skew the reviews by writing positive reviews. they're probably die hard fans of the game and can't see past their love of the game to give you a serious look at the game's flaws. frankly it's biggest flaw is the pay model. you cannot say that the pay model should be judged seperately of the gameplay, not when the gameplay is so closely tied to the pay model. if i didn't know better, i would have thought the game DLC quest was a parody of this game. that's how bad the pay model is.",

Well, i'll tell you it was damn annoying! He shook and shook and I about had enough. I aimed my gun right at the back of his head and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened though. I was confused for a moment and tried again, low and behold the same result. As it turns out you can't actually shoot other players in the game. Well i'll tell you that I'm a determined man. So, I drove over to Harry's house opened the door and sure enough he was shaking that damn cow farter in game. So looked right at the back of his head and ACCIDENTALLY shot him. Again.

Nothing beats the thrill of spotting a deer with a huge pair of antlers after such a long time of tracking it down. Walking around is peaceful and exciting. It isn't free to play though. The only thing you can hunt unless you pay is mule deer. I got to maybe 10 mule deer kills before I couldn't take it anymore, and so I bought 3 months of premium for 9.99 USD (or around 7€) and 1000em$ so I could buy myself a good weapon and rifle scope, and that in total cost around 15€.  I wouldn't say this is a game for everyone, but it sure gives me a super hard-on. Shooting animals is so rewarding, and the long walk isn't bad. It's peaceful and filled with excitement. You almost get a heart attack when you know you're really close, so you're looking everywhere, and then a moose roars from like 10 meters away. It's just way more exciting than you'd think. This game isn't really free to play though, you really have to pay a little, but it's not much; still less than normal games usually cost.",

I would rather actually go hunting and get a hunting license then pay monthly for this game. Also some of the scenery is actually dated now. And there isnt much variety as far as what you can hunt. Why cant we go fishing too? Might as well add that. For a better example of hunting, take a good look at how far cry 3 did their hunting.  I do like that you can fast travel. But why is our walking speed so slow? Why cant I run? Running feels more realistic and then Ill just suffer the consequences and the animals would then proceed to run away if I run toward them.  Overall, its ok but definitely not suggested for newcomers expecting a 'free' hunting experience.

This might not sound bad, but when you consider the fact there is a tremendous amount of stuff, AND you have to pay for membership... it gets pricey. I want to be able to get lots of gear for my character, but Im not spending hundreds of dollars to do it. Its would be nice to have a system where you can gain points for hunting, then use them to buy things free. Then just have gear that you can only get on premium or something. I like the way this game is set up, but i completely disapprove of how greedy they are. I would actually spend money on it if they werent so expensive, which is why I refuse to give them a dime.

But for people who actually want realism in their games (me being one of them, to an extent) this game is perfect. In real life, you need a license to hunt certain animals, and I am pretty sure in real life said licenses are temporary (maybe per season I dunno) and this game simulates that and MUCH more. The fact is, I got bored of the game on my first day, mainly because I was in a pissy mood and couldn't find any thing to hunt. on the second day, in a much better mood, I found a multitude of animal tracks. I was so happy, so I tracked it down for about 20 minutes. I found a Mule Deer in a field, lined up a shot, and killed it with a shot to the lungs. I was so happy, having tracked down and shot my prey much like a real hunter. So if you like to hunt for the thrill of finally getting that kill you've been tracking all day? This is the game for you. I definitely suggest this to any hunting enthusiasts who happen to be looking for something that hits closer to home than other hunting 'Simulators' especially since you definitely know you achieved something when you start to unlock extra perks (not CoD perks, perks like tools, weapons, extra access basically.) it really makes all your hard work show. It is also pretty good for if you want to just sit down, and walk around taking in the beautifully built environments in which you can hunt. There are even collectibles you can collect, recreational activities like shooting on the Firing Range, Skee Shooting, Hiking, and there might be more to come.",

My recommendation is if you feel like you need to buy a pack, choose the beginner one because it gives you more to do for less cash. Maybe adding deer and small game like rabbits as something the play can hunt without buying a pass would help this game out. hope the devs read this so they get the idea.

But on the flipside, when you get the kill, it's insanely rewarding. Now everyone here is complaining about the business model, which I can't entirely blame them. On the flipside though, this is the same business model the game has had for years, and simply, if you actually do enjoy the game, you'll be willing to pay the money. Does that make it any less ridiculous? No. But this game has been around for years, and the makers keep adding more and more to it, so if paying the money supports the game you enjoy, I say pay it.  Now the payment and a loss of interest has resulted in me not playing this game in quite some time, but the free membership gives you exactly what you need to figure out if you're willing to pay. Hunt some whitetail, get a few kills, if you like it, if you feel like the reward outweighed the boredom and learning curve, then drop some cash. In the end, give the game a whirl, it's a niche game for a niche community, but if you find out you're part of that niche, you won't find a better hunting game honestly.",

I've only played the free version, mind you, so I can't say much for the rest of the game.

If you have the money and you enjoy hunting simulators I highly recommend this game to anybody who would be willing to invest a small amount of money into such a detailed and well made game.  Now, the community. The community is 98% friendly when you meet players online, however there is those few 'odd-balls' out there. Most players who have played the game for a while will be willing to help the newbies learn the ropes of theHunter, as long as you are respectful of their hunt.

Although dont expect to get a shot at a large buck or fowl within the first five minutes of game play(unless you have a load of horse shoes in ur back pocket). Secenery and plant live are well done as well, my only beef/problem with this game is that of which all free to play games seem to have. Being that they have too much of a pay-to-win aspact then a level-to-win, which in this case it might as well be a demo for a more complete game. Since players who dont pay for the in game purchase-able currency(Em s) cannot advance past the first default rifle, this means your stuck with it for the entire gaming expience, the only default animals you can hunt are Cotton Tail Rabbits and Mull Deer. Which makes the non-paying players feel like a neglected spet child. Therefore I cannot fully recommed this game due to the overwhelming amount of unfairness and lack of gameplay options(different animals to hunt) towards players who choose to play a free-to-play because it is free to play.

You can get the same feeling in this game, as you can in the real world, stalking up to your favorite ridge that you spent all year scouting for the perfect deer trail to sit on. Unfortunatly, this is a negitive yet positive review. Not for the game, but for the micro transactions that rival Zynga. EA atleast has some compassion when it deals with micro transactions. To enjoy any aspect of other than hunting mule deer and rabbit you need to buy a license. Which is fine, the game is free after all. So, paying 31.99 for 6 months of play time seemed fine to me at first. Until I wanted to pack up and send it to the nearest duck pond to slay some Mallards. Come to find out, I needed to purchase a duck call, and a duck decoy to even have a chance at landing a duck. So, I proceed to the store, hopeing I could buy the items with in-game currency. Sadly, to purchase additional items you need to either succumb yourself filling out third party surveys that fill your e-mail with spam by the minute, and probably a cyber stalker. Or you pay for items. So after paying 32 dollars for this truely amazing game, I have to spend another 5 dollars just to get a chance at some ducks. Not to mention if I wanted to get bear bait, lures, scent covers.    If you are fine with paying around 150 dollars to unlock everything in this game to aid you in your hunts, than by all means. Buy it, it's a wonderful game.",

For an initial $15 (basic membership) you get licenses and unlimited ammo for three months and a shotgun and pistol. With this and your already owned .243 you can basically kill anything if you take the time, but putting just a little more money into it could make it even better. For example. I had been gifted a membership by someone I met in game which expanded my ability greatly, and with that $15 membership plus $15 for the .30-06 rifle and a scope I had three months of animal killing fun. The guns included with the $15 membership plus almost any rifle you can choose from will open a door to hunting any animal in the game.  I can promise anyone who is really interested in or already into hunting that they will like this game if they put a little money into it.

            "review_text": "This game is by far the greatest hunting simulation I have ever seen. The hunting, and tracking tactics are great. You can get the same feeling in this game, as you can in the real world, stalking up to your favorite ridge that you spent all year scouting for the perfect deer trail to sit on. Unfortunatly, this is a negitive yet positive review. Not for the game, but for the micro transactions that rival Zynga. EA atleast has some compassion when it deals with micro transactions. To enjoy any aspect of other than hunting mule deer and rabbit you need to buy a license. Which is fine, the game is free after all. So, paying 31.99 for 6 months of play time seemed fine to me at first. Until I wanted to pack up and send it to the nearest duck pond to slay some Mallards. Come to find out, I needed to purchase a duck call, and a duck decoy to even have a chance at landing a duck. So, I proceed to the store, hopeing I could buy the items with in-game currency. Sadly, to purchase additional items you need to either succumb yourself filling out third party surveys that fill your e-mail with spam by the minute, and probably a cyber stalker. Or you pay for items. So after paying 32 dollars for this truely amazing game, I have to spend another 5 dollars just to get a chance at some ducks. Not to mention if I wanted to get bear bait, lures, scent covers.    If you are fine with paying around 150 dollars to unlock everything in this game to aid you in your hunts, than by all means. Buy it, it's a wonderful game.",

Now I know what your thinking that sounds pretty good actually. But here's the catch you need to pay for certain animals to hunt. Which woulden't be so bad if you earned your hunting licences instead, or if you could hunt all the animals in one certain area. Unfourtantly that's not the case for this hunting simulater. You need to pay real money in order to hunt the extra animals that the game features. Not only that each animal requires its own licence to hunt. There's only two animals that can be hunted if you want to actually play it freely. Mule Deer and small cotton tail rabbits. However even with the extra rabbits you can't kill them. You need another weapon and since the game doesn't just give it to you. Than your stuck with mule deer.  Is it good atleast?  To be honest its not bad. But I only wished it had more to offer for anyone who actually loves to play these certain games.  I would recommend it just to someone who really loves hunting simulaters. Other than that it's not that special.  If you got the idea this game is a cash cow not a F2P  I'm going to extend this review to say its been nearly 4 years since this games release and its still the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ cash cow.",
