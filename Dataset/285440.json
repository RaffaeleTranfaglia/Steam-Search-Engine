            "review_text": "While most gamers haven't heard of it, Crimzon Clover is a bit of an icon to fans of scrolling shoot-em-up (or 'shmup') games, and widely regarded as one of the top amateur-developed titles out there: its original PC edition was so well-received, in fact, that the game was given a spit-shine and re-released to Japanese arcades on the digital Nesica format. Few non-Japanese gamers were destined to ever try it...until now, that is, since that version has beaten the odds and made it Westward as 'World Ignition.'  In case you needed to hear it, your goal here is to blow up lots of stuff, collect lots of shiny stars, and not die: you've got a handful of aircraft to choose from, each of which is armed with both a standard shot (which is always at 'full' power, so dying won't hamstring you) and an unlimited-use 'lock-on' weapon, which covers a large chunk of the screen and can zap lots of enemies at once, but deploying it slows your movement, so take care not to unleash it if you need to boogie. As you wreak havoc you'll fill up an energy meter, visible in the upper right: once it's got a bit of juice you gain access to a smart bomb, which will damage everything onscreen and give you a moment of invincibility to catch your breath: you can only stock one at a time, but refilling the meter enough for another one doesn't take too long, so definitely use it when you need it.  If you let the meter continue to fill all the way up, however, hitting the bomb button will instead activate 'break mode,' which is where things get interesting: while this state lasts, your firepower is boosted, and so are the points gained from blasting baddies (and if you can get the meter all the way up again before the 'break' runs out, you can enter a 'double break,' which juices things up even more). While surviving is just a matter of moving, shooting and bombing at the right times, racking up high scores involves constantly juggling your shot, lock-on, and energy meter to get the most points possible out of every target - enemies send loads of attacks your way, but only the small, shining 'hit area' at the very center of your ship can take damage, so if you can weave that tiny bit of yourself through the dangerous bits you'll make it out the other side in one piece.  While the basic idea of the game never changes, there are several modes here that put a different spin on things: aside from the standard 'Normal' mode, there's 'Boost' mode ('breaks' are activated automatically and don't run out until you bomb or lose a life, but enemies get tougher the longer you can keep it going), 'Unliimited' mode (an extra-tough challenge for veteran shmuppers), and 'Time Attack' mode (a fixed course where you have infinite lives but only three minutes to rack up as many points as you can). Normal and Boost also have 'Novice' variations, which are easier than the standard ones and well-suited for those looking to get their feet wet and build some confidence before moving up; you can also practice individual stages to shore up spots that are giving you trouble.  Though certain sections of the game will smack you down hard and suddenly enough to make you wince, don't let that dissuade you from giving it a shot: if you can manage to get through the front door without feeling intimidated by the screenshots full of unfriendly fire, you'll find one of the most polished PC shooters in existence waiting for you: moreover, it's a bit of a miracle that the gaming gods have even seen fit to bring such a little-known gem to our shores in any form, at a steal of a price to boot, and they deserve recognition for making it happen. If you still hold any love, or even curiosity, for the simple, deep, hard-edged and irrepressibly pure arcade titles of old, by all means look this one up: releases of its caliber are all too rare these days.",

            "review_text": "Full disclosure - I am not an expert shmup player. I can't beat games on hard difficulties, or on only one continue, and I don't have a vertically oriented monitor/television to play them on. But there's something incredible about playing a great shmup, when everything comes together - great music, varied enemies and bullet patterns, and game mechanics/controls that just make you feel powerful and make everything fun. This is what Crimson Clover is to me: a fun, extremely difficult bullet-hell shmup, but one that can still be enjoyed by the casual fan. I probably had to use an average of 10+ continues each time I've played through the game so far, but it was still a fun and interesting experience. The three ships have different bullet patterns and stats (Type III moved around the screen quickly but has a narrow bullet spread), and it took me a few plays to even realize that you could press a button that not only narrows your bullet spread to help concentrate on a larger enemy/boss, but also locks onto a bunch of enemies and fires off some lock-on missiles (reminds me a bit of Panzer Dragoon, or maybe Raystorm? I think it's a fairly common feature in a lot of shmups - and speaking of powerful, Type II's lockon attack is badass) - I guess I would have known it earlier had I actually watched the tutorial but I really was able to just jump into the game without having done so and it was still fun as hell. Bombs erase all bullets on screen at the time and destroying certain enemies also removes their bullets from the screen, and you can (and must, in many cases) use these features in order to survive. The first I activated Double Break, wow, talk about a bulletstream. There is an arcade mode with an Unlimited Mode available, and should be perfect for veterans of the series who might find novice mode too easy (novice mode still has a ton of bullets on screen at once, but even after 3-4 playthroughs, and as someone who isn't all too good at the genre in general, I was starting to excel at dodging/memorizing certain patterns or using my bombs/destroying enemies to remove bullets). Most of the shmups I've played are on the Dreamcast or Xbox 360 (or Jamestown or other indie ones on PC) and I have to say that this one ranks up there with one of the most fun I've played (I'd have to put it up there with Jamestown and Deathsmiles). The framerate fluctuated between just under and just over 60 FPS no matter how much was going on on-screen (and with the amount of explosions, stars and bullet sprites that can be on screen at once, especially with double break activated, that's nice). The only real complaints I have are that it took me a little while to figure out how to get my controls working (I wanted to use a 360 controller and start is not mapped to start [it's mapped to Y, which is actually helpful if you need to pause in the heat of the moment, but the game doesn't have button prompts for the 360 controller, hence 'partial controller support', but it works fine out of the box], so I had to press random buttons on the keyboard until it activated the menu, and it turned out I had pressed one of the second player keyboard buttons, so when I first started the game I had to select two ships and then just let the second player ship get blown up). It also took a few tries for the game to properly keep track of my video settings, and you need to tweak the stretch settings to get the game to fill the screen on 1920x1080 resolution. A patch to include native 360 controller support and to make the resolution settings a bit less cryptic would be cool, but are not really all that necessary since you'll probably get the hang of it quickly. Whether you're a casual fan of shmups or a hardcore bullet-hell player, I can't recommend the game enough. It is also forgiving enough with the continues that it could serve as a great introduction to the genre, mainly because it embodies much of what I like about any shmup (cool looking sprites, great music, varied ship types and the explosions, bullet sprites and the way the ships control and destroy everything in sight just makes you feel powerful).",

            "review_text": "If you're not the type of person who tends to like bullet hells, Crimzon Clover is unlikely to change your mind, but it's also not trying to. On the other hand, fans of bullet hells have little excuse to pass on this gem.   Crimzon Clover doesn't have extremely elaborate attack patterns like you would see in a Touhou game, but what it does have is bullets, lots of bullets, so many bullets that if you tallied up all the bullets in Mars Matrix, Jamestown, and Ikaruga combined Crimzon Clover might very well still have them beat - and that's on the standard difficulty. The enemies aren't the only ones with lots of firepower though as players can fairly easily fill up part a gauge to use bombs (though the amount the gauge needs to be filled increases with each bomb usage), wait until the gauge is full to enter the destructive and score-multiplying 'break mode' or fill up two gauges to enter the absurdly powerful 'double break mode'.  Crimzon Clover also provides a good chunk of variety for players. There are two difficulties (and possibly even a third, hidden difficulty of some sort) as well as four distinctive modes of play, three different ships, local and online leaderboards, and the option for local co-op. Crimzon Clover also graciously provides the option of unlimited continues for less-skilled fans of the genre (I lost track around the 30 continue mark on my playthrough) and comes with a customary 'true' endboss for anyone capable of performing a 1 Credit Clear. In terms of stages, Crimzon Clover is a bit on the low side at 5, but these are five fairly lengthy stages, non-boss enemies very much pose a threat and do not simply exist for the sake of points, and many stages even have a full-on midboss.  Lastly, Crimzon Clover is simply beautiful to look at. There is an astonishing sense of speed to the game as panoramas rush past the player and nearly every enemy has multiple moving parts and intricate animations. Add to this a fast-paced soundtrack and plenty of explosions and Crimzon Clover is nearly worth buying for the aesthetics alone, to say nothing of the fact that it is almost certainly one of the best bullet hells out there and possibly even a strong contender for outright being *the* best in the genre.",

With that said,  Crimzon Clover:  WORLD IGNITION   is the triple fudge dark chocolate chip cookie made with golden wheat flour, fresh eggs and just a little bit of cayenne pepper to bring out the depth of the chocolate.  I don't delve too far into bullet-hell shooters, but once in a while I absolutely crave these little morsels of gaming, and when the craving takes over I need a good shmup to take me over and  Crimzon Clover:  WORLD IGNITION   has enough deep mechanics, great style, and hand cramping, pants crapping moments to scratch that itch one-hundred times over and still have me begging for more.  If you're at all interested in  Crimzon Clover:  WORLD IGNITION  , and I assume that if you're on this page that you are, then buy this game! You'll be helping a Japanese indie developer and getting a crazy-fun rollercoaster ride of bullets!",

            "review_text": "This game is just overwhelming. It's one of those bullethells that goes out of its way to be over the top and flashy. It follows standard bullethell ideas, three ships, a stage where you go forward, shoot things, your overpowered, and everything explodes. What it does differently is that EVERYTHING IS BIG AND LOUD AND IN YOUR FACE! You can fire, shoot homing rockets, and do something called Boost Mode where you get even more overpowered and the screen becomes a deathtrap to increase your points. In the first stage alone there are almost 700 things to make boomies out of, and it has your fair share of difficulties. Well... 4 of them. You got Boost Mode which means infinite Boost Mode (Very Easy mode), Standard (Easy), Unlimited (♥♥♥♥ on a ♥♥♥♥ Extremely Hard), and Time (egh?).  Pros - Over the top madness mixed with standard bullethell ideas makes for a tasty treat of death and destruction. Very well made means good FPS, score is very large treating you with a nice 10 Billion points for no lifes lost so scores are more diverse, good fun all around.  Cons - Since everything is dying horribly it's hard to see your ship very well. Most of the time you caught up in killing everything that you commit suicide out of pure fun and it gets really annoying mixed with the very very tight controls. Recommend using something that will help movement, it's very wild and fast and sometimes unpredictable. Lack of settings mean smaller screens will be shot down, lack of settings to control to mass destruction of death from keeping you from suiciding, and last but not least only 4 modes and it wouldn't be so bad if the difficulty wasn't so wonky.  It has a lot of downfalls but the pros keep it standing firmly. Get it if it's on sale and your thing.",

Gameplay: Meth-infused explosive mayhem--don't blink. Also really solid systems, gotta love the feeling of unstoppable power you get from 'breaking'  Graphics: All you have time to look at are those sweet, sweet gold stars but from what I can see inbetween vollies of purple death looks gorgeous  Sound: Soundtrack is slightly less panic-inducing than the Raiden games which in my mind is a plus.

For the last decade and a half or so, I'd been intimidated by the direction shooters had taken when they started dramatically increasing the number of bullets on the screen. I still played old shmups on fairly elaborate retro setups, but nothing new. I thought the genre had left me behind. No way could I clear even level 1 of one of those 'bullet hell' games.  Then one day, after picking this title up in a bundle, I plugged in the trusty arcade stick, and gave novice mode a real try. Much to my surprise, I could play it. Hell, for the first couple levels, novice was too easy. I'm now gradually easing myself in, using the training modes to perfect my play and see boss patterns. Replay modes give me a chance to marvel at how long I actually managed to survive, and finally get a look at that fantastic background art. The soundtrack is another wonder--it never seems to get old. Control is simple (and should be), but there is a lot of nice complexity offered up by the risk/reward of the boosting mechanics.  I will say that I did have one (major) problem, however. Starting the game up for the first time on my 720p screen didn't work. I troubleshot it using tips from the forum, and after a few tries found a walkthrough of blindly changing the resolution that worked for me. I shouldn't have had to do it, but once it was done, it was fixed forever. Outside of that, the online highscore system is pretty slow, and I haven't found a way to disable the pre-game tutorial. So Crimzon Clover is just one major, and two minor gripes away from being a perfect game, IMO. So now buy it. For real.",

            "review_text": "I came here to get one thing off my chest (and my slight aching right thumb that held down both the fire button and the lock button for a long time on my PS3 controller/gamepad), and it is this:  THIS GAME IS FRICKIN' AMAZING.   I would've said that other word that starts with F, but that's not important to mention. That, and Steam would replace the word with heart symbols.   But why is this game, as you put it, 'FRICKIN' AMAZING'? Well, my friend, as per most modern day shmups go, this game is ridiculously fast paced, and on top of that, a vast amount of challenge and reward (in the form of big scores and shiny stars). Also, bullets and laser beams will be filling your screen around a good 90%-95% of the time in a playthrough.   The game comes with four modes: Boost, Original, Unlimited, and Time Attack.   Boost is a mode that adapts to your skill and playing style (but mostly the former), in a mode where you have unlimited Break Mode (there will be more on that later) once you get it activated. Truly a fun mode for those who are into earning big points, big stars, and firing gigantic, powerful lasers at a barrage of enemies.  Original, as you may expect, is a mode that emulates the original Arcade release of the game on your computer within the comfort of your home (or in my case, all over the place, given the fact that I play on a laptop).   Unlimited is essentially Original mode but with the difficulty pushed to the absolute limits. For those who can 1CC Mushihimesama Futari or reach the second run of DoDonPachi with ease, this is for you.   Time Attack is a mode that asks you this question (not in the game, but in the case of me trying to explain this mode): 'How many enemies and how many points can you score in the time given?' You have unlimited lives, but, as expected, you don't have unlimited time. If you ask me, it's one of my personal favorite modes in the game.  All of the modes are fast paced and fun to play around with. I suggest tinkering around with each one and see if you can find your favorite.   In addition to the four modes, there just so happen to be four ships to play as: Type-I, Type-II, Type-III, and Type-Z; the last one being an unlockable through playing the game and collecting medals associated with completing certain tasks in each mode; such as completing the first level without dying with each ship.  One mechanic that definitely had me grinning was Break Mode; a mode where you can wreak havoc on many ships with a temporary damage upgrade to your ship by filling up the meter (that also acts as your bomb once it passes a red line) in its entirety. There is also a narrow bar under the bigger bar that you'll be focusing on, and this can play a major role in storing up a Double Break Mode opportunity. Double Break Mode is essentially Break Mode, but twice as powerful as regular Break Mode and the Break Mode timer is twice as long; and from there, the points start piling up at a rapid pace.   If anything, all I can say is: BUY THIS GAME. And at the time of this writing (during the Steam Summer Sale), it's only $2.49; so there's no reason not to get it.  Happy shooting down ships! ...And insects. ...And tanks. YAY.",

            "review_text": "There's still something worth fighting for! Try beating the level 5 boss without using a continue!   Never before has a vertical scroller shoot'em'up been so powerful.   Become invincible and gain extra firepower when using the Break system, which can be activated to unleash a super powerful shot that covers the majority of the field for a brief period, deflecting most bullets upon activation. Charge it twice and you'll get Double Break mode, an even more powerful version of break.  Adopt various playstyles after shooting down enemy bosses, by looting the different power-ups released by them. Lock-on and unleash various types of damage upon the targeted enemy. The bosses are, in order of appearance:   Titanix  - A ground based mobile fortress defending the Armoured City,    Hecatoncheir  - A six-armed robot defending the canyon that leads to the secret cavern entrance to the base.    Maelstrom  - An extermination type base defense cannon protected by flower petal shaped armour, defending the exit of the cave the player entered from stage 2.    Diabolos  - A flying, modular mobile weapon with a a fleet of small carriers, protecting the base from the sky.   Gorgoneion  - A massive computer like device constantly absorbing data of unknown content and building new weapons to protect itself.    Crimson Heart  - The true final boss, unlocked after clearing through Gorgoneion without using continues. Little is known about it, except that it resembles the default sprite of Type Z, adding to the mystery of why it would appear after Gorgoneion appears and the player has apparently stopped a kind of apocalyptic event, as hinted at in the text that which appears before Gorgoneion.    Collect star points to unlock extra credits and the Type Z shot. Use three shot types. Type I, which is available from the start, and has a slow speed, but higher damage, Type II, which has a 'rolling' style of shot and higher speed, and Type Z (has a sprite identical to the Crimson Heart boss), which has a very wide and very high damaging shot. Hold lock-on while selecting it and the sprite will change to a re-coloured Type A, causing further mystery by sharing design with the Crimson Heart.   Play three separate game modes. The first is original mode, which uses the standard gameplay mechanics, with no modifications to the basic break, bomb, and life system. The second is simple mode, which works with a rank system. Break cannot be activated, but is instead triggered by filling the gauge all the way up. Fill the break gauge to also increase bullet speed in three intervals (0%-49%, 50%-99%, and 100%) and game difficulty as power increases. Shoot enemies at point blank in full break to cause massive star points to appear. Finally, unlimited mode, which is identical to original except performing a shoot down with fully charged lock on will release a shower of star points and greatly increase the difficulty.  These key features truly make Crimzon Clover outstanding. Its name is a reference to a species of clover native to Europe. An indie bullet hell game developed by Yotsubane. It was released for Windows in Japan in 2011, the arcade version was released in 2013 and WORLD IGNITION was released worldwide on Steam in 2014.

I also own most of Orange Juice Create games (AOS, Suguri, Sora QP shooting etc.). I also own a few other Shumps/Bullet Hells/Bullet curtains like Stellavanity, Exceed, Hellsinker, Kachiverse, and Astebreed. These days, when-ever I boot up a bullet hell, I would sigh as I would get smacked by a random projectile...on the first stage. Then I'd promptly turn it off and play something else.  This game though, it has a certain charm, it makes me want to try. So far I have reached the 3rd stage midboss on arcade mode. The scoring system is also very appealing, with chains rewarding good players, and encouraging mediocre players like me to improve, so I may reach a higher score (and those all important extra lives!).  Very satisfied with my purchase, thanks for re-igniting my bullet hell fire. With touhou 15 in 3 days no less, it is time to take up the good fight again!",
