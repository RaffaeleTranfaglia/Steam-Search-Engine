            "review_text": "Ok, so it's a review of a game that's almost 5 years old, but what the hell... Creating an expansion to an RPG that is as epic as Dragon Age: Origins was never going to be easy, and it's true that Awakening doesn't have as gripping a story, nor is it as detailed or as in depth. It definitely has the expansion 'feel' to it, with new features that seem more like they've just been tacked on than anything else. So things aren't off to a great start.  However, as you play the game you find yourself getting somewhat emersed in the story, which is still very good despite the lack of depth compared to Origins. The story itself is quite original, and your companions include one of the best character creations i've seen in an RPG to date (I won't giveaway who it is just in case you've still not played this). So while it is much shorter than Origins, it's still a lot of fun and well worth playing if you enjoyed the full campaign.  I do have one complaint, although i suspect this is more my doing than a mistake by Bioware. This adventure isn't particularly challenging and getting through it is fairly straightforward. I suspect that this is at least in part due to me importing my character from the Origins campaign though. Using a new character could well change this point of view... i've just never done that. Where it HAS improved on Origins is that it is now VERY hard to please all of your companions and the chances are at least one of them won't like you much. There are also a few missions that will put you in awkward situations which result in you not being able to do every single mission available... so choose wisely. I like this aspect a lot and is something that Dragon Age II took further (and by all accounts is being taken even further still in Inquisition).  Unfortunately one issue does overshadow the whole game, just as it does with Origins... The game is badly bugged and frequently crashes to desktop completely at random. There isn't much you can do about this, other than save your game FREQUENTLY and hope to god it doesn't crash right after a long fight, long dialogue scene, or worse of all, a long scene that contains both... This is infuriating, and yet i persevere because i am such a fan of the Dragon Age series. This is definitely a game killer for many people so if you have even the slightest feeling that potential instability will ruin the experience for you, don't buy this!  The final word is the same as i wrote in my review of Dragon Age: Origins.... Namely, don't buy this and Origins seperately, buy the Dragon Age: Ultimate Edition and get both Origins and Awakening together plus all the extra DLC. It not only works out cheaper, but much of the DLC does actually improve the game quite nicely... for once!",

            "review_text": "It's not in the same league as Origins, but it is still a fun play through.  It does introduce some characters that later appear in Dragon Age 2. The most noteworthy being the companion Anders who goes on to be a major character.  Don't buy it thinking it is a continuation of the Origins storyline. It is not. It is near enough a stand alone adventure.",
