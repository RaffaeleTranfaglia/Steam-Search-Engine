That looks like 'Dead Colony' a bit' -Watches trailer. -'...HOLY COW, it IS Dead Colony!' -Presses the crap out of 'buy' button! -10/10, would fire up Desura client again!  So, my 'time played' won't be very long as of writing, but had to point out that this is a re-launch of one of my favorite Desura games, now come to Steam under the name, 'Monsterland'. The new look adds a good deal 'character' to the game. For the price of $0.89 at the time of writing, you should defiitely give it a go!",
