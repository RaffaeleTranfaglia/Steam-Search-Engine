            "review_text": "Search and Rescue may not be for the hardcore flight simulaton gamer. It is not fully realistic, but still you'd better have a Joystick with some axles for it. It is somewhere in between of Simulation and Arcade. Compared to Sim copter this title is more simulation and more serious. Where in Sim copter you flew around in a city and things happened which you had to clear, in this game you can fly around on different Island maps and things only happen, when you start a mission with a specific objective each. For each mission you can choose one of the helicopters that can do the job (not every Helicopter is available in every mission). There is no career mode where you get better Helicopters after some time of playing. At least there is no career mode, yet.  What makes it absolutely worth it's money is the feedback of the devs and the overall communication between customers and developers. Main Problems that people had with the release version already are solved a few days after release. Other things are going to be implemented soon to improve the game experience.  There's a lot of crappy simulators out there, but it seems like the devs of SaR do everything for this game not to be one of them. And so far, they're doing a good job. A few improvements here and there, and in my oppinion this game could be worth more money. Graphic junkies might be a little bit diasppointed, but for everyone else the graphics are absolutely appropriate. The music is annoying after a while, so I already set it off.  All in all, If you want to extinguish fires, carry stuff around and rescue people with a helicopter, this game is for you. Could it be better ? Yes Is it still fun ? Yes Is it worth its money ? Yes Is there support ? Absolutely Yes",

At least I paid with Pap Pal so I am disputing the charge now. Again, DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS DEVELOPER!!!",
