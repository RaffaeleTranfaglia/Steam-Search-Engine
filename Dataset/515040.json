You have to handle the national debt, trade with other countries, defeat ISIS and you can even start wars with other countries. The gameplay gets pretty repetitive after a few hours, but for 3 $ you can`t really expect more. The way the game was done is pretty entertaining. So Trump give you advices how to govern in the best way and if you click on something you will hear some of his quotes. All the other countries are also described pretty funny, you just shouldn`t take it too serious.  And hey, in which other game can you a build a wall and make Mexico pay for it ? ;)   Pro: - You can make America great again - You can make America safe again - You can make America rich again - Valuable Trading cards and funny achievements  - Pretty entertaining   Contra:  -Very simple Simulator/Kind of repetitive -Not that long to beat",

Overall, nothing to write home about the graphics, voice acting, or game play. Mostly, the graphics looks like a flash game, voice is just a spliced and paste of Donald's speech to comedic effect (I'm like a chess grand master playing against a checkers child), and game play is about max/min mircomanagement with the point and click combat scenario thrown in involving Trump in the helicopter shooting at ISIS terrorists in CANADA (of all places).   Really fun and funny game as it is one of a fee that had me crying with laughter at the sheer comedic genius of this game. Easy achievements and should last 1-2 hours.",

I think the basis of much of the games confusion and frustation for me was the complete randomization of the market, coupled with how quickly fear and love for America deteriorates. I'm not going to change my review because, in essence, I still agree with what I said, but I do believe the devs care about the game and want to make it better, and I may repurchase in the future if any major changes are made. :)  Thank you again to Cavalry for being so kind in his response even though I was a bit of a ♥♥♥♥.",
