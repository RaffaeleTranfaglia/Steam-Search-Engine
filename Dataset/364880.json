Pros: The pros I found with this game which I immediately felt is that it's a very clean and finished product. Controls are nice and simple and it's gamepad compatible - which is a nice added bonus for indie games and I personally enjoy playing this way. Finally, the music is fun and nostalgic of this genre!  Cons: I personally found that things was a little too polished and that the artwork lacked the depth of classic retro games. It felt like not a lot of love went into the environment design or backgrounds. The enemies suffered with this same lack of imagination with the design or functions.  To sum up I'd say this game isn't for me but I can understand why people would enjoy Genesis of Drones, it's cheap enough that you can find out for yourself!  I uploaded my experience on YouTube if this helps you decide!         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  A Brief Case of The Tell a Phones | Genesis of Drones&nbsp;",
