            "review_text": "Disappointingly, just another badly edited RPG-maker game. I had such high hope for it.  + Somewhat original setting + Custom sprite with less-usual style + Custom ethnic music, though interspersed with standard RPG maker music.  + Cost less than chewing gum.  - Standard RPG maker gameplay without much twist  - So badly need an editor I want to cry. Seriously, discounting the obviously non-native english, author, dev, writer, I want to ask you something. Have you ever played any commercial, professional games, or read any commercial, professional fiction, that uses multiple exclamation marks (!!!) in every other sentence? Why is one exclamation mark is not enough? No, seriously why? It makes this game looks less like commercial, professionally-made game and more like some fanfiction script made by a 13 years old. Even if you ignore the awkward english, this, and the typos, are independent of someone's mastery of language.  And then the awkward writing...  I know that the writer is not native speaker, we should commend multilangual people. But someone who can speak a language doesn't mean they can write or translate. I know this, because I work in translation business (not actually as translator or editor though). Native speakers of multiple language is not always good at translating either language, and an english major graduate don't always mean they're good at translating english. That's why translator, editor, and writer, is a job.  Mind, I'm not saying the game has bad story. The good-ness of a story is independent of how well it's written. You can have a good story that's badly written. Especially since this is an RPG that heavily depend on the writing. Bad writing is easier to swept aside in an action game or puzzle game. Not in an RPG.  You see, the problem is, this is a commercial product. You're selling them. That's why it's held in different standard than something you make in your leisure for your friends. Imagine cooking. If you're cooking for you and your family, eventhough it's too salty, or charred, everyone will just laugh and enjoy it, and still thank you for it. But if you're selling your food to people, you're open to criticism. People are allowed to grumble or complain when your food is too salty or burned.  Summary: If you want this to feel like a professional work and not just hackjob, please find someone who can write in english and edit the script from ground up.   Or not, it's your life, I can't tell you what to do with your life. I'm just sad that a potentially good game like this is so held up with bad editing and writing.",
