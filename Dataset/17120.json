Then someone told me about Children of the Nile on a message board when I was talking about how much I loved Zeus. This is a worthy successor, a very well done game. Simply amazing! I have wasted countless hours playing this game. I've had it for a while and the game is very well made. It is a city-building game, and one of the few that are great. Children of the Nile and Tilted Mill had definatly rose the bar on quality city-building games, so much that I get disappointed by others and come crawling back.  This game is well worth it. Very well worth it.",

            "review_text": "Children of the Nile Alexandria is the expansion pack to Children of the Nile and where the main game survived solely on the fact that the city builder genre is almost dead, forcing fans to either suffer through it or starve, the expansion pack is starting to make starvation look mighty delicious.  Alexandria does not address any of the main game's problems or deficiencies, it simple adds a few campaign and a few new buildings.  Unfortunately the maps are few and broken, missing base resources making playing through them increasingly frustrating without fan made patches. The new buildings, the Great Works, serves little purpose, simply being prettier pyramids you can't get buried in.  Alexandria does however have one redeeming quality however, it is one of the only DLC's that can consistently be given away on Steamgifts without any entries. Even a month long giveaway will only attract 3-4 entries making it a great troll giveaway.",
