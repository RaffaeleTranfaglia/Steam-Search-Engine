            "review_text": "Commander the great war is an exceptional world war 1 tile based strategy game with an extraordinary amount of depth and replayability. After reading other negative reviews this game has recieved i was struck by how ridiculous they were. Well over half of them state that the ai cheats. That the ai has huge production bonuses and can produce three times as many units as human players. That the ai's units recieve combat bonuses that make them twice as strong as the human players units. All these claims are simply not true. However i can understand how many players have come to these false conclusions.  - The ai are very good for a turn based strategy game and may provide a serious challenge to newcomers.  - The strategy's you must use to triumph are so vastly different to all other strategy games, simply because the first world war was and still is so vastly different to any other wars that have ever been fought.  - The attacking unit will always take far more damage than the defending unit (up to four times in fact!!!) therefore to overwhelm a single enemy infantry unit is not uncommon to have to attack it with 3 of your own infantry units and only after you have weakened said enemy infantry unit with artillery bombardments and harried them with fighters.   Many players have also claimed that artillery, fighters, armoured cars, bombers, zeppelins and cavalry are useless and unbalanced. While there may have been some serious balance issues in 1.5 the recent release of the 1.6 beta patch has fixed 90 percent of these balance issues. As for these units being useless even prior to the patch this was never the case. Artillery may appear to do little damage but the small amounts of damage they do in addition to the damages in efficency they cause to enemy units are invaluable and are almost required to make any kind of serious pushes into enemy territory. Fighters and bombers function as aerial artillery and there large range and high sight values make them very usefull as scouting units. Zeppelins have the highest range and sight and this more then makes up for there lack of durability and the drain they will inflict on your precious ammo stockpiles. Armoured cars are twice as fast as infantry units can see four time as far. This makes them usefull scouting units. What cavalry lack in defense they make up for in speed, sight and offensive capabilitys.  Commander the great wars singleplayer will eventually get dull. However the multiplayer never will i hope you have enjoyed my rambling review and that you will like it to prevent any firther loss in sales this game may suffer due to false accusations of cheating ai.  Good day",

            "review_text": "I played the regular campaign yesterday. I chose the entente and squished prussia from both the french and russian sides while maintaining a pretty active skirmish in Serbia. I didn't get to the point of feeling the computer cheats, like I do with civ. I was able to win in 1915, which is early historically, but I was still satisified with my day long campaign.  You really get a sense of the different theatres of the war and it heavily emphasizes defence over attack, which makes sense in trench warfare.  Anyway, I'm happy I picked it up. Looking forward to trying out the multiplayer.",
