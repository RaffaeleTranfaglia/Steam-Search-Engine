The gameplay, based on point-and-click adventures, is minimal, but the same cannot be said about the content which is actually a deep and even disturbing reflection on human life itself. As such, this game quickly develops into a thought-provoking philosophical experience, loosely based on the classical myth about Sisyphus (who was ordered by the gods to push a stone uphill over and over and over, since it always rolled back at a certain point) with some extra thoughts by Albert Camus thrown in.  Usually, I'd skip through a game as crudely drawn as this one, with only the most basic of artwork. But the texts and the interactions - even though they mostly seemed meaningless to the absurd - quickly grabbed my attention, and I played through it at a leisurely pace. Though the game is very short (I played through it in half an hour, reading everything), it shouldn't have been any longer given its thought-provoking nature. The almost minimalistic sound track does provide the right amount of extra atmosphere at the right moments.  All in all: well done, and certainly worth trying out if you're into games that dig (excuse me the pun) deeper than most. You get a very easy 100% achievement game as a bonus, but that feels completely trivial after playing a game with this kind of content.",

            "review_text": "Sisyphus has to roll the boulder up the hill every day. This task is meaningless by itself. Sisyphus is not performing this task because something better awaits him once it's done. This is all there is. It is absurd. Sisyphus can embrace the absurdity of the task and choose to be happy in spite of (or even, because of!) it.  Similarly, life is inherently absurd. There is no meaning. We can either rail against the infinite injustice of this, or we can whistle and continue to push that boulder up that hill. Instead of looking for the ultimate meaning of things and being disappointed with what we find, we can, quite simply, choose to be happy. This a conscious choice that we have to make. Once we embrace the absurd, we can focus on the actions that will bring joy to us and others around us during our short time on our home planet. - Vandita Kapoor  To dig or not to dig.

I'm buying the collector's edition as soon as possible, no doubt.  EDIT: I bought the collector's edition, and I can only recommend it.

If this does not make you think and feel at the same time, then it's rather hard for me to be convinced that you have cognitive or affective empaty, if at all. This, by far, one of the most beautiful story I've ever experienced in a long time; my legs are numb now that I have finished it. The ending was carthartic, but not as much as it can possibly be; I'll have some jazz to pat me in the back anytime now.",

            "review_text": "No doubt a thought provoking, perhaps even disturbing or enlightening experience for some, coupled with an alluring, notably Beckettian atmosphere, the appeal of which, in my opinion, unfortunately constitutes what is the most prominent saving grace of the game in itself.   Rather than actually finding (or even reasonably ascribing) anything meaningful about this poor soul's freshly imposed existence (and by extension to our own), the experience seemed to have had quite the opposite affect, in that, for me, it only served to elucidate the illusion of choice, the fundamentally illusory nature of free will itself, and ultimately proceeded to champion the perpetuation of an empty existence, an existence which at its very core is quite apparently inherently meaningless, toilsome, and often almost unconscionably miserable, by rather subtly alluding in the very end to the potential for a better life (as represented finally by the growth of an actual living tree, in addition to the application of color to the environment), or at the very least to a justification for the perpetuation of this one, to be found in succumbing to the incredibly deceptive nature of the perceived 'hidden beauty' within the process of the struggle itself (noting that aesthetic beauty in itself doesn't necessarily imply an intrinsic objective value, and in some cases has substantial difficulty upholding even a subjective one), while also maintaining that this struggle ought to be considered beautiful because it is indeed our own. After all, how can we really claim to be the possessor of a process, much less of one so apparently driven by various forms of causation (sociological, psychological, physiological etc), and one of which we most certainly find ourselves to be consistently at the mercy of? Given the setting, I couldn't help but recall Samuel Beckett's final exclamation in The Unnamable: 'You must go on. I can't go on. I'll go on..'   Having said all of this, I want to be clear that I'm not attempting to be toxic in doing so; the game itself is astonishingly simple, but manages nonetheless to be quite compelling, and the overall atmosphere, the combination of this minimalist, low-fidelity environment alongside the lovely (albeit appropriately minimalistic) musical compositions, coupled with the predominantly disparaging tonality of its foundation in absurdist and existentialist philosophy makes for quite the interesting and, dare I say it, 'worthwhile' experience, especially considering the fact that it's entirely free of charge.   To conclude, I'm merely stating quite simply that I myself have reached a point in my experience in which I can no longer 'imagine Sisyphus happy,' as Camus so succinctly prescribed, without discarding my capacity to reason, without thus affirming that in doing so I can only have succumbed to delusion, as well as to the predominantly illusory nature of the human experience in general. So, even if it is in my opinion a failed attempt to validate the efficacy of Camus' argument against the prospect of suicide, against the will towards non-being, I must admit that the undertaking (or struggle, if you will) by the programmers, artists and thinkers themselves to attempt doing so within the confines of such a brief allegorical experience was nonetheless an ambitious, admirable, and generally well-executed one, and I would love to see more of its kind from them in the future. I would also most certainly recommend it to anyone seeking some semblance of meaning in their lives (as my opinion of its efficacy is entirely subjective), and it may very well serve as an extremely simplistic, nonetheless engaging introduction to the core philosophy contained in Albert Camus' 'The Myth of Sisyphus,' especially with regards to younger players. All things considered, I give it an 8/10, and think it should provide an overall rewarding experience to anyone who possesses some level of intellectual and emotional intelligence.  In addition, I must admit that I found it especially hilarious when I found myself incapable, whether by a glitch or by human error, of earning the achievement 'Not To Be' (choosing to do nothing), and subsequently gave up..  It's presently difficult to imagine anything more impeccably ironic.",

Well, this has joined that section of my brain-shelving system ;D   Seriously though, thank you so much for this experience.
