    "description": "Synonymy is a non-profit, educational word game narrated by Richard Dawkins where players are challenged to find a path between random words through their network of synonyms. By taking the synonym of a word, and then a synonym of that synonym, and so on, you can ultimately arrive at any other word in a language.",

            "review_text": "This game benefits by making one's vocabulary larger that is especially helpful for me who isn't a native speaker. Its gimmick is interactivity: all these leaderboards, championships, retweets etc. look like they're a natural and logic-based part of the game, not just an attempt to follow today's social network craze. Indeed, it is a good reason to communicate through learning and playing, and I'd like to see this game translated in other languages, as it's planned, to make its educational value even bigger, going beyond the English-speaking world. The bad is, that the game is obviously made for mobile devices in the first place, so this PC port isn't as great as we'd like to see it. Still, this game, even as it is, is definitely worth trying.",

If you're a fan of word-based puzzle games, especially old fashioned ones (lookn at you crossword people, you bogglers and scrabblers of words) you will likely enjoy this game. For the price, not much of question even if your not a huge fan; even going a few rounds will get your money's worth.",

I bought it on sale, and just didn't get my money's worth. I haven't played it long, and that is kind of my point. Just wasn't enough to keep my interest.   4/10",
