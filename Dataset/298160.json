            "review_text": "This is a indie MMORPG that has been around 8 years in the making. It has launched in November 2013. For a small team of artists, programmers and developers, they have done an amazing job with the game.  What I like about Eldevin:  You start off as your character - and Eldevin has a classless system, so you can choose/switch what class you'd like to be - from Warrior, Templar, Assassian, Ranger, Mage, Prophet or even a mixture. You gain talent points every time you level, and you can use those talent points in the tree of the class you wish to use. You also obtain points to increase your health, melee, mage, range etc.  The storyline is interesting, and some quests allow you to interact and some allow you to choose the outcome. There are also a few puzzles which is another bonus for me.  As long as you don't mind the graphics which kind of has a charming feel to the game itself. There is alot of content to do, from training skills, to questing, to doing dungs with a team or by yourself (story mode).   You can also explore the world of Eldevin, complete achievements, and obtain pets/mounts/vanity.  While exploring Eldevin, you can also use forms of 'fast travel' from using a dragon handler to travel to a place but requires money, to using a homestone which allows you to teleport to the one city that it's attuned to - with a few hours limit - and to buy portals to summon a friend to where you are - to instant dragon which immediatly teleports you to a place of your choice (but requires eldevin points). And yes, Eldevin is that BIG.  This game is completley F2P. There are suscriptions available if you wish to recieve bonuses like earning more money/exp from quests/monsters that you kill.  Eldevin also has a shop where you can purchase things with Eldevin Points - purchased with real life money or even in-game if you swap gold for EP with other players.  You can buy mostly vanity/pets or you can also buy storage like sacks which helps carry your gathered/crafted resources. Fear not, if you can't buy sacks, there is a baby version known as baskets - which you can buy with in-game money - the only difference that it'll hold less.   Same goes with backpacks (which gives you more inventory space).  There are other things you can buy like skill boosters (gives more exp in gathering/crafting skills).  Combat:  You can use auto-attack feature to attack NPC's quickly, with the two basic abilities - melee and range.  There is also abilities that you can use, either purchased from a NPC shop for in-game money, or unlocked from the Talent Tree.  Since it's classless, you are not restricted to one class, and can use abilities from other classes - like healing yourself.  Using abilities however uses MANA, so fortunatley there are ways to restore mana through potions/food or letting it restore itself.  PVM:  PVM can be found in dungs, ascended dungs (hardmode version) and world bosses as well as quest bosses.   PVP:  There is an area where you can fight other players, gather useful loot, and even fight a world boss when it spawns. So be sure to look out for Trapper's Atoll aka the Wilderness. :)  There are also PVP modes you can do as well.  Other Modes:  There are other modes then just dungs.  You can fight in the Eldevin Arena - facing against monsters in a team (not sure if its also solo), and fight in the Trail of Champions.   Skills:  There are 14 skills in total, which 7 is gathering, and the rest is crafting.  Gathering:  You can gather items in many places/areas in Eldevin. Different resources spawn in different areas.   Crafting:  The crafting system is a bit more in-depth, where you don't just need raw resources to make... mage gear as an example. You convert the raw resource and wool into cloth, then you use cloth/thread to make that gear.  However, some gears are basic. There are gears which require more resources in order to make it. You can either buy those resources, or obtain them yourselves from doing Dailys and dungs.  Another example would be cooking. You don't just need fish, but also items gained from Farming/Foraging. Each type of food has a benefit for a certain class. It can also heal you/restore Mana - but can't use during combat. That's for potions made from the skill Alchemy.  What I don't like:  Typically you can level up by doing quests, but you can also grind on mobs to gain experience to level up - and sometimes that is only way you can level up and continue doing quests which requires certain levels to complete.  Some quests can be boring, like kill that/obtain this for me, and bring it back. Those are usually side quests though.  There is no Guilds or Auction Houses yet but it's in the plans of the Hunted Cow Studio team, and thus the wait still continues :).   However the postives outwiegh the negatives for me, because the team is willing to listen to feedback - and theres alot of content to enjoy in the game.  &gt;  I would totally recommend this game to you, if you're looking for a new MMORPG to play.",

            "review_text": "The biggest complaint is that there are no people in the game and this is somewhat true there are considerably less people than other MMOs but the game is very fun it is a lot like runescape. I actually think that the lack of players works out in everyones favor. See in WOW the servers are very crowded and from a purely social standpoint it is very easy to get lost in the crowd. Here if you try you can make friends I mean there are some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but there are also a lot of great players. I find it easy to approach sommeone alone by a dungeon and ask if you would like to do it together. There are also only six classes to choose from so a player can get comfortable with each class and the strategy used to play it which is hard to do. It also can be difficult for some people to get used to communicating online and in MMOs and feel this game is great for that. I enjoy the game and hope the developers update it to increase the interest in new players. It is free to play so there is no cost which is good. They also have seasonal events which are quite enjoyable. I guess every MMO has its problems but It has decent multiplayer interface and I lot of quests. The dugeons are fun to go through if you have a good team of people. Again it is basically like runescape so if you like runescape you will like this game. The developers will hopefully continue to update the game and create tasks to keep players involved and hopefully one day they will have enough people to run PVP events. I personally found no trouble to find people to do dugeons with and if you need someone I would definitely go with you.",

Now, this may sound odd due to the graphics from 1999, but thats actually what I enjoy. It is a very 'busy' game that requires a lot of quests, but for the most part the quests are sprawled out enough to the point that it doesnt always feel repetitive, which is a problem I've noticed a lot in mordern MMOs. Nonetheless, if you enjoy MMOs at all, I highly recommend this game.",

One thing I think Eldevin does really well is that is very simple in a good way. MMOs now adays are overly complicated and convoluted.

This game has an engaging, imaginative storyline, a class-less combat system, a whole mess of crafting, all in a very large world.  The graphics...are terrible. I'll say that right now. But graphics shouldn't matter for a gem like this. If you liked OLD runescape, when it was good, play this. If you want nostalgia, play this game.  There are a few bugs, mainly around using WASD to move making your toon move at a crawl or suddenly switch directions or teleport a bit, but I've quickly gotten used to a diablo-style playstyle instead of a rift or SWtOR kind. (FIXED!)  All in all:  Gameplay-8.5/10 Story/lore-9/10 Combat-9/10 graphics-5/10 nostalgia-10/10  OVERALL-9.5/10, VERY good, I definitely recommend this to just about anyone.",

For a free MMO (well, mainly free, there is certainly an P2W aspect in here but it's mainly ignorable) this game has a lot of content and a lot of things to sink your time into, especially with a few friends. With a huge skill tree system and no locking into classes, the amount of customisation available to you from the offset it vast and interesting. Although the basic roles offered in most MMOs are also present here - Damage, Tank and Healer - there are other ways to really customise your character and class as much as you would ever want to. There are lots of things to do on the map, such as dungeons, and the professions system is quite in-depth and enjoyable. While there is a lot of grinding, the grinding in this game is among the most enjoyable I have ever had. Overall I would give this game about an 8/10 so far",

        {
            "review_text": "50 hours in-game:  Eldevin is a addictive, slow-paced and story-driven MMORPG that is similar to Runescape 2 in many aspects.  You have a freedom of choice when it comes to using your talent points and building your character - You can pick any role and switch later on. When starting out, you are given a bunch of quests - In fact, more than you need to level up. Quests require a lot of travel and in order to do quests you need to have combat stats. It doesn't take long to level combat, but if you just keep doing combat you miss out on various loot and skilling (profession) opportunities - there being 14 different professions.  Professions can be tedious to level up because of slow animations (that you have to wait for), having too little inventory space, requiring a lot of travel and the materials costing too much at least early on. The sell price for most items is too low; you are constantly low on cash if you decide to use the materials you find for training professions. Only quests seem to reward a good amount of money at least at lower levels.  Crafting professions can require 2-4x more effort to level up than a gathering profession. What I mean by this is that you'll reach the max prospecting level 3 or 4 times in the time you max Jewelry, Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing. I think this is rather stupid - it's just a time consuming grind to get to higher levels of each crafting profession for almost no benefit.  Even at higher levels, the time it takes to get to a level that matches your combat is better spent elsewhere. Instead of spending 10 hours to level 5 crafting levels, you could spend 10 hours questing and get 5 combat levels. Why should you do questing then? Because even if you get one crafting profession to your combat level, you'll only get that profession's specific equipment pieces; for example, a crafted heavy armor helmet to complete the set you just got from a dungeon, leaving rings/amulet/charm and weapons to be made with Jewelry and Weaponsmithing respectively. So yes, in short, the crafting professions feel useless and too tedious to level up.  Getting so little money from enemies and items early on creates problems because you need money for repair and training a profession. For example, from a level 10 quest you get 2 silver - it costs 2 silver to buy 4 butter (buy from npc) to go with your 8 ham (skinning/loot) and 4 garlic (farming) that you need to make 4 cooked hams at level 8 cooking. Yes, that's 2 silver or 1 quest to make 4 items.  There are a LOT of fetch quests with way too much travel; some are literally 'go talk to north, go talk to south, talk to northeast, talk to southwest..then visit these locations, but first go to the beach and then check out the very end of a dungeon' type quests. The quests are all over the place (which can be nice, but not when most of them make you travel back and forth so much).. There also needs to be more item rewards in quests - The only weapons you get from quests (or anywhere else) at level 5-10 are either: one level 5 rare (boss or quest), level 6-10 uncommon (crafted) and level 10 legendary for legendary quest and then again you don't get any other good weapons until level 15. Crafted items are useless here too because they are all uncommon up to level 10 or at least worse than your weapons found from quests.  The game is good otherwise, but indeed could use some improvements. I really like the soundtrack though, it's great. The graphics are good for a MMO of this type, but the game has some bugs. Your cursor can go crazy at random intervals because the game process starts to use more resources, your camera can start to spin in certain places and make it hard to turn it.  The controls are great, being able to either click or move with WASD like in WoW, but it'd be nice if your character tried to get to the given location. Sometimes when you click, for example to move inside a tent through a narrow door, the character goes back and forth. If you move straight towards a small object, your character doesn't try to avoid it either.. I'd think it'd be nice if it did.  The in-game mounts don't really feel like mounts with the small 20% speed increase at early levels and 60% at later levels. A small buff would be nice.  add later:  again a lot of travel from all of this equipment taking a lot of space if you want to save some of it as a outfit for later - no huge equipment bags (like vanity) there is no auction house and no place for trading actions take long to do enemies out of range even if in range events for veterans missable by newer players because quest starting points are all over the place and some quests are for the same area, its not uncommon to see higher levels in low level zones still completing some quests because of the reasons mentioned above, quests should be shown further to you on the map. soundtrack is awesome, but cannot be found anywhere. 5 loyalty points per login for f2p - full loyalty set = 9000 points there are some p2w items; subscription literally gives you extra exp, prestige, profession exp, removes gold cap (WTF literally) even vital skills such as skinning can get behind in your combat level because of so many quests at certain levels and not having enough space for quest items/skinning. this means you have to go back to lower level monsters and just kill them for skinning exp so you can continue questing with the ability to skin your level monsters. skill quests: for example level 16 giving tasks to get level 1 or level 8 gathering prof. items; can be annoying. abilities not powerful, animations take long which makes them very ineffective. certain abilities are broken and some descriptions are a bit off. at least the templar talent tree doesn't feel very optimized no third skill bar for alt/ctrl/shift + normal keybinds even though there are a lot of skills  level balance seems to be a bit off. lets say you barely solo a LV10 dungeon in story mode at level 11, then return after getting a new piece of epic boss dropped gear - you'll be able to do it without much worries.  most boss fights can't be tanked, but have to be taunt-kited instead; really need some work here...need aoe marks on floor and clear indicators of what the bosses are going to do (this one boss on 'dungeon' difficulty does 60% of a tanks hp on one melee swing and there aren't many healers playing the game (and if there were, they wouldn't heal much). this is extremely frustrating when paired with the movement / combat system of eldevin  there is an achievement for killing 100 000 players in the wilderness and another one for winning 2000 battlegrounds.  this is just pathetic because no one will get those legitly; they just take too long. As a comparison, I, still at rank 20 rogue on my realm in WoW ( even though i haven't played for a year), I had 44025 honorable battleground kills and played 1438 battlegrounds.  you have three options  1) quest and only level combat, do not pick up profession items - your inventory won't be full at all  2) quest, level combat and pick up profession items - your inventory will be very full quickly because two 4-9 slot bags aren't really helpful  3) pay 10ecash and get a 64 slot bag a long with other goodies and have no trouble questing, leveling combat and training professions.  why can't f2p system be more in between option 1 and 2?   Legendaries take too much space for f2ps. whats a legendary item when it has to be sold to npc for 10 silver because you don't have 2 to 6 space for it?  target out of range even if close issue  insane respawns at certain locations means you cant melee the monsters or you get overwhelmed  I'll edit this later...",

Art is like we're back in 1998, animations are very clunky and performance suffers from the Java coding (good thing the art is so simple that on today's PCs you don't notice it).  Then the community, or rather lack of it. The website states that there are over 400K players registered.

I can see how it might shoehorn me into a pretty specific build later on, but so far I have had success going glass cannon crit mage.   So ~22 hours in and I can say that, although its very rough around the edges, once you find your way around Eldevin it becomes quite a joy to play. I still haven't met anyone who I didn't like, so they are attracting the right community somehow so far. I have two characters who are completely different, and I have barely scratched the surface of what Eldevin has to offer in terms of character building.  I would have to say that there is a certain 3-way split in Eldevin's Talent tree that I have noticed: Templars, Warriors, and Assassins have beneficial talents which cross over reasonable due to them all being based on melee damage. Rangers are sorta stuck as a pure ranged class unless they really find a way to minmax there way out of a damage loss they will ultimately incur by going hybrid.  Mages/healers are pretty much the most capable of sharing parts of their talent trees due to the nature of healing being based on the same stat as magic damage 'Sorcery'.  As for crafting...its a bit tedious, but its tedious in most games like this. I will say that you can definitely gather enough resources to go afk crafting for a good half hour at least if you do it right. Best part about that is you gain xp the whole time. The balance of costs of materials and such is very tight. You wont have spare money early on unless you really try very hard to earn it. I enjoy the challenge, because there is some planning expected of the player here. Dungeons seem a bit easy when you have a full 5-man group, although they can be rough if you are all underleveled and utterly clueless as to how to use your character.   All in all I still recommend this game as a 'try me out' mmo. It's free, after all.",

Lastly the part that made me quit the game is because there is a gold limit for non paying players(though i never hit it once but i think it was 1100 gold), this made me think that at some point a non paying player cant upgraded his bag's space and bag slots. Game is actually very good if your willing to part with some cash but be prepared to play a game where you are most likely always alone (according to sources peak number of players across 3 servers is 100-200 players and this was like last year).

Which will give you those points that you need for smooth sailing. You can learn all the crafts and skills. So you can switch classes and take up professions that works with that class without losing progress on anything. The crafting system has got nice depth to it and still makes sense.   There are a lot of skills/spells for every class that allows you to build your character the way that fits your play style. You can even use skills from the other classes in your build.   Missions missions missions. There are so many. Dailies that for skills, missions for reputation, missions for craft rewards, side missions and main quests. So if you like missions you wont run out quick. Alternatively, if you don't, you can still dungeon grind your way through levels easy enough.  Finally, the community is nice and helpful. I have done tons of dungeon runs and never got called a noob or derp if I got stuck not knowing how to proceed when doing a dungeon the first time. People are friendly and helpful, which is rare these days.   I am likely missing a lot of things I wanted to add here, but I am rushing to get back in game.  There are a few hings that gets to me personally, like small stack sizes in inventory and a lot of back and forth running in quests, but I can also understand why this is so.

There are no bots, it is not pay to win and the story is enjoyable and reasonably unique.  Definitely give this game a try (it's only a matter of MB to install!) if you are willing to look past some dated graphics and a small playerbase.
