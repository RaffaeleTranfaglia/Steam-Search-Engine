But be aware that this is not going to be a walk in the park! You will meet your enemies after a couple of minutes on the island... You might face some controller issues, still. But besides that, it is a clear must have for horror adventure fans!",

The only things I will say that aren't so good with the game is that the voice acting ain't too shabby, but it could be better. The game could've also been longer and had a wider range of characters and setting.",

            "review_text": "The game had potential, but the backtracking and detours kills the experience... like many generic horror games these days. Making the game not particularly scary nor fun, just tedious.   At least they tried though unlike most indie horrors these days. The acting isn't too bad and the overall design is pretty good. Unless you're completely new to these types of games, give it a miss.",
