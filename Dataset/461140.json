            "review_text": "This game made me feel sorry for spending 16 cents for the first time in my life.  Pros: - Drops cards - If you have a friend you really hate, then you can buy this game and send it to him/her as a prank - If you like games with same fps as tetris, then this is just made for you - This game makes you realise that you'd rather go and spend time outside than play this game. For example going out, climbing up a tree and jumping off head first feels like a better idea over playing this thing.  Cons: - You can actually get cancer from this game - Controls are simply chaotic for item usage - Store sometimes makes the game freeze for 2min - For such a kids game, levels are incredibly hard and most likely you won't spend enough time in this game to complete the first level - Keeping in mind that it's only 16 cents on sale, it still feels waaaaaaay overpriced. Don't think anyone would play this 'masterpiece' even if it was f2p game. ",

            "review_text": "I remember when Klabi was announced at E3 for the first time and since then I had been waiting for its release. And this game did not disappoint me.  Now let me start off by saying that I've been a huge fan of Mystic Games since the very beginning.  (That means I am really important and I have a valuable opinion).  They have had some great releases recently like  Aircraft War X  and of course, who could forget,  ZOMBIE ZOEDS   But Klabi is a masterpiece like no other. People here giving bad reviews just don't understand such genres as  Action ,  Adventure  or   Psychological horror  . Klabi will show you what is  REAL  Action,  REAL  Adevnture and  REAL  Psychological horror. Games today try to mimic Klabi but fail by adding 'fancy graphics' and 'proper mechanics'. If you are a  REAL  fan of these genres and know what they are really about you will appreciate this game.   I have nominated this game for the 'I thought this game was cool before it won an award' award and I would urge you to do so too.",

Guess this passed green light cuz it has a cat as a protagonist. You have to move a cat around uninsipred blocks, dodging barber shop signs that sometimes kill you and sometimes dont through paths where you cant avoid them, and grab pasted .gifs of sucker pops and candy canes, ennemies are flat, most everything lacks even basic animations.
