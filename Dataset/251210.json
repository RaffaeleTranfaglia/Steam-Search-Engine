            "review_text": "The 'real' HIVE is a great board game, which is the 6th in the abstract games rank at BoardGameGeek; this videogame is perfect trasposition of it, so for the transitive property, we have a great videogame.  The interface is smooth and polish; the graphics are beatiful, the sounds are immersive and fit well in the mood of the game. On top, we have ALL the expansions available, hence mosquito, ladybug, pillbug.  Regarding other option, the multiplayer game works very well, but it's a great shame that there are very few opponents to play with.  The AI, considering how complex is a game like HIVE, is fairly good but I've played too few matches to judge it and I'm a novice player.  What I said until now are the PROS, obviously there are little CONS.  The multiplayer game is only syncronous, maybe an asyncronous mode will be very useful, considering the penury of online opponents.   The camera has an auto-zoom function that controls zoom-in/zoom-out in automatic way. Very often it works well, but I prefer the option to disable it and take the control of the camera to choose the % of desidered zoom level.  In concljusion if you like board games, abstract games or -simply- funny games, buy HIVE and join our little group of HIVE players!",

It also allows you to custom the look of the pieces (carbon, classic, animated). The only problem is that you have to pay extra for the mosquito, ladybug, and pillbug pieces. Overall very well done.",

To be honest, I purchased it only for make bad puns in a recension. Back on serious businnes, now with asyncronous play it should be easier to play with opponents, but I have to admit I haven't tryed multiplayer yet (too much games, too less time). If you love chess, buy this game. Also, the grasshopper sound in the menu could help you sleep better in winter, make you pretending it's summer.",
