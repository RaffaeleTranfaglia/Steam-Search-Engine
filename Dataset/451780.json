            "review_text": "Thiss game is a mess, and as such is really hard to judge. It tries a lot of new things, but fails at many of them. If I had to analyse it coldly and rationally, I would consider it a bad game. But I had so much fun that I have to recommend it.  The concept of the game is very interesting : it's a giant boss fight and not much else. There are a few mooks here and there but they all get one-shot easily. And contrary to other RPGs, the boss isn't waiting in his castle until you've grinded enough EXP to defeat him. He's at the doors of your castle, killing your civilians, and you're sending your Overlords (classic anime girls) to slowly deplete his 1 trillion HP bar.  Despite its colorful cute anime graphics, the game explores extremely dark themes : despair, primal fear against a seemingly unstoppable predator, grasping at straws using the little time you have to train your Overlords and bond with them, knowing that most of them will die before Trillion does - if he does at all. All this is well conveyed, and it's been a while since a game made me care so much about a character's death on an emotional level.  The story, visuals, music and writing are top-notch, with a very Disgaea-ish vibe (makes sense since it has some of the Disgaea staff). But it brings the usual Disgaea flaw in gigantic proportions : game balance is an atrocious mess. You allocate your EXP points in tons of different stats, passive skills, active skills, and most of them are useless, which you won't know until you've tried it and sent your Overlord to the death for nothing. You want a tanky biuld with high DEF and RES ? You'll get one-shot anyway. You want a magic build ? Useless, especially end-game (for reasons I won't spoil). It's Speed + Attack build or nothing, and since some Overlords have low base attack and high base magic they start at a huge disadvantage. On the other end, you can win much earlier than you're supposed to by combining some game-breakingly good passive skills. And why wouldn't you, when the life of characters you like is at stake ?  As a conclusion, I recommend this game, I enjoyed it a lot but it leaves a sour aftertaste to think how much better it could have been with some more polish on the game mechanics.",

            "review_text": "I'd like to preface this by saying that this review stems entirely from my initial play of this game. If the first hour of a game does not grab you that is a failure on the part of the game.  I came across this game because I'm a fan of tactical RPGs such as Disgaea, though which looking at that on steam directed me to this. The concept of Trillion is something I can really appreciate: There's one big bad boss waiting for you and it's up to you to deplete it's utterly massive health bar. The meat of the gameplay, evidently, stems from preparing to fight the boss through a training sim type part. Once you have used up the time allotted you (assumedly) would engage the boss and (again, assumedly) either succeed or fail and need to repeat the cycle again.  I'd like to address some core problems I had in my brief time.  1) Controls - The game utilizes a square grid for battle and implements the use of a controller. However the controls for combat are a little...unwieldy. It may be due to my own experiences with using a controller in tactical combat games but it felt awkward and unpleasant. You can move in any of 8 directions and, since movement is done via the directional pad on the controller, necessitates camera rotation in order to move exactly where you want to...which is what you need to do. The left stick is altogether abandoned in spite of its ease of use in such a movement grid and you are left awkwardly moving the camera before adjusting your position via the d-pad. It just plain doesn't feel good.  2) Gameplay - The training sim part seemed fairly standard. My only problem is that each individual training increased a statistic. No explaination was given for what these stats do or how they function (possibly explained later, but not when first doing such training) and they are separate from the more standard stats you see in RPGs such as attack and defense. What is most glaringly problematic, however, is the actual combat. While it is possible that boss fights outside of the initial prologue introduction are different, what was made clear to me at the time was simple. You move on a square grid and enemies move at the same time you do. You need to plan your movement and attacks so that you deal the most damage while taking the least, often attempting to destroy small enemies immediatley. Boss attacks are telegraphed and color coded to warn how much time there is until the attack commences. As a base, these are serviceable elements. Where this becomes problematic, however, is in the training dungeon between boss phases. You encounter a number of enemies of which they can have a number of attributes and effects relevant to how they fight and what they do. An example given is an enemies that is immune to attacks from the front, but there are also enemies that explode on death and those who leave behind harmful poison. This is problematic, however, as the only way to learn about these things is to experience them first-hand and, early on, you are given no tools to deal with these types of issues outside of a basic attack and skills you will likely be unable to use much if at all. The second enemy I killed during my first attempt at this training dungeon poisoned me, and the poison did enough damage to deplete 90% of my 7.5 million health bar of the course of about 8 turns. The only reason the poison did not kill me at the time was because I managed to get to the end goal before that happened. While the stakes were low, it seems remarkably unfair for effects you wouldn't know of beforehand to be so devastating on a first attempt...but this is my own personal view.  3) Progression - As should probably be obvious by the title, Trillion is a direct reference to the fact that the boss you fight has a grand total of 1 trillion health. Your characters have health totals around the 10 million point (at least at the start, potentially going higher than this, but I can't be certain with how little I played) and deal around 40+ million damage with basic attacks. While I can appreciate that the numbers need to be big given the scope of the boss' health total, it skews perception when a character with 8 million health dies in two hits from a random enemy. Even in older RPGs that start you off with much lower numbers (such as Dragon Quest, for an example) the enemies you encounter at the beginning are not so fierce as to instantly kill you. Basic enemies should present a threat to the player to be handled rather than an instant-death hazard to be avoided at all cost, at least within the scope of an RPG.  4) Voice Acting - On odd point for me to touch on, and I will freely admit this is my own tastes, but this was just another nail in the coffin for me. Immediately after starting a new game it prompted me to confirm if I wanted to play the game in Japanese. Since I don't know the language I declined...and I was almost immediately regretting my decision. Within the first hour I played there were words and names pronounced in ways that seemed wrong to me (ex. Baphoment pronounced 'Baf-o-may' instead of how I would expect 'Baf-o-met' and miasma as 'my-asthma' instead of 'me-as-ma') and character voices conveyed an...odd tone, it felt. It's hard for me to put into words, exactly, but it felt like the voice actors were trying to create a voice that was a character trait rather than simply give a character a voice. When I heard them I thought not 'this is X character with Y trait' but 'this is Y trait character' and it kind of detracts from the experience.  I've gone on a long tangent about this game, but I'd like to make it clear that I don't hate it. Honestly I'm positive that there's a lot to this game that has promise and is even done pretty well. The story, for what I saw of it, had promise and the concept is sound. Training up to fight a devastatingly powerful boss is actually a rather refreshing idea for an RPG. However in the end the execution just feels flawed and I, personally, can't ignore those flaws.  You might like this game, there's definitely parts of it to like, but I can't honestly recommend it with what I experienced. The first hour of a game should convey what the game is about and what you're trying to do and compel you to do those things...but Trillion: God of Destruction did not do as such for me. ",

Art's really pretty, 95% of the game's worldbuilding is done with 2d illustrations. Japanese voice acting is good... the scenes feel a bit long winded and the drama's more serious than I can deal with (don't expect the level of comedy of a Nep game) so I'm speeding through them rather than listening for the most part. Music is good but not as good as Disgaea series xD  Game has some decent strategic/tactical depth. The format seems pretty fresh - the game's journey is just to beat one trillion HP boss which is slowly rampaging torward the castle, damage done to it across fights is cumulative.  And like any game with resource management and a turn cycle, I ignore my increasing hunger as I strive to hit that end turn button again...and again...hour after hour...",
