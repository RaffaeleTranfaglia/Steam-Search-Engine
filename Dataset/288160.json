Atmosphere is great and very fitting the main theme, which I can't disclose as I consider it to be somewhat spoilery. Puzzles are interesting and varied and most importantly it lefts you wanting more, much more, especially answers! Are we getting more? That is the question.",

            "review_text": "Yes, believe the hype. The awards this game received... The 'overwhelmingly positive' Steam reviews... The Room is the best puzzle game I have ever played and I've been playing them since the 1990s. It's puzzling in its most basic form. There is no real story, you just tackle one big puzzle, although it's divided into five chapters. It's hard to describe in a few words why this game is so good, but simply put: it's fun! And playing The Room feels exciting and rewarding. They just got 'it' right - 'it' being everything a game like this should be, while being a completely unique experience unlike any other puzzle game I know of.  Maybe just a few short additional notes, though, that may help you decide whether to buy The Room if you're still not sure: - it's a short game: it takes only about 3 hours if you take your time, so you may want to pick it up when it's on sale  - it's a rather easy game: for me the game was just challenging enough but if you're the sadistic kind of puzzler who only likes being challenged to the point of migraine, you will not find that here. On the contrary, there is a hint system in the game so if you feel stumped at any time, you can click a button to give you some pointers.  - the Steam Achievements are the most basic: one achievement for completing each chapter of the game.  I would recommend this game to everyone, not just to people who like playing puzzle games. It's really that good. But since it's a pretty short game, you may want to wait until it's on sale to buy it.",

            "review_text": "The Room (note: not based on the films The Room or Room!) is a point and click puzzle game that will be familiar to anyone who has played a room escape video game or done a live action room escape. You are in the haunted attic of a mansion and you find an elaborate and ornate box. By flipping levers and dials, pressing buttons, putting keys in locks, and generally fiddling you slowly open more and more of the box and learn about the secret of the room. The plot is mostly flavour and mood rather than a concrete narrative. Puzzles are fun and generally fair. The game looks gorgeous. At 2-3 hours, I think the game is priced appropriately.  I want to emphasize two things for people considering the game: First, the built-in hint system is excellent. Automatically after fiddling around for a while, if you're not making progress, the game will help you by giving you a hint prompt. Click on it and you'll progressively get more information. In this way you never feel stuck or under pressure. If you're getting frustrated, take a hint. If not, that's okay too.  Second, while the visuals on the PC version are excellent, the controls remain optimized for touch platforms. The game is very tactile, lots of dragging and rotating and moving things. Although this is replicated here via mouse controls, I think it's probably a little more playable on a tablet for that reason. I beat the game on iPad a few years ago and replayed here. I believe the game is generally cheaper on tablets as well. So if you're a big Steam collector, prefer playing everything on PC, or just want to support the devs, by all means buy this, but if you're considering both the tablet version and this version. I'd go iPad first.  Looking forward to the third installment being released on Steam.",

You’re in a room with a well-locked safe and your goal is to open the safe. This however, isn't as easy as it sounds. You need to unlock a series of boxes, each with several hidden secrets and clues that keep you engrossed. Turn dials, pull latches, find safe combinations, unlock hidden compartments that contain keys, solve video, memory, colour and path finding puzzles and uncover the secret of the creator of the safe. I have to admit that I am not the biggest fan of puzzle games but 'The Room' is very unique. This game is really something special, don't miss it.  Pros: - great ambience - excellent graphics - mysterious story - very well balanced difficulty, puzzles are challenging but never frustrating - incredibly well designed  - addictive - clever hint system  Neutral: - short, three to four hours  Cons: - open ending (but there's 'The Room 2')",

Graphically I was almost in love! Some of the scenes and individual items are amazing and when you complete one thing you think hell, you just want more and more.  Moods change from from 'what do I have to do here' to 'What on earth was that noise'? It can get quite mysterious and as I am not an expert in 'Alchemy', I often was wondering what will happen when I do this.  Don't worry as you will soon find out and what evolves from your efforts will keep you interested, so have no fear of that.  Seeing as I normally and 'FPS' type person, this was a big move away from what I would generally play but am I glad I did. Not that I still don't love a good 'ol shootemup, but this offered a break away from the usual.  I definitely do recommend and give this a rating of 8.5/10.

That should be expected, as the original release was an iOS app. And there are optional hints that become available over time too; they did a reasonable job of nudging me in the right direction, when needed (which I used in several spots).  I personally believe that $5 for a 2 hour game is worth it; you're spending less than the average movie for about the same entertainment, and the hints are good enough while not being completely obvious.

Some puzzles are easier than others, but each one unique.  Essentially you rotate around an object (ie box, safe, table, etc) that has a bunch of mini puzzles that are interconnected to solve the larger puzzle. Similar to the way Nicolas Cage opened up the Resolute Desks in National Treasure 2, but way more intricate. It's unlike any 3D puzzle game I've played and it is a must have if you enjoy puzzle solving.  On a side note, I did experience one bug with this sliding gem on a circular sectioned platform where it got stuck on a little nipple/spike thing towards the end of the puzzle. To work around this, I did a few rather large and quick mouse drags across the screen at different angles and I got it to jump over.",

The game only has four chapters, and then ends with an abrupt tonal shift like it's suddenly a horror game or something. There's little to no payoff for the game itself, or satisfaction in playing it.   A bigger problem is that there are only two kinds of puzzles. Extremely obvious and easy ones, and ones that you are unlikely to get or understand because it expects you to notice tiny, insignificant details to discover things. Often, puzzles don't flow, meaning you will finish one, not get anything, and be left looking around trying to find something without any clue as to what it actually wants you to solve next. This is likely because, when they fall into each other, one after the other, they become obvious and easy. The issue with this game is that there is not challenge outside of being lost; there are no logic or thought based puzzles to make you think. It's essentially a game of eye spy in 3D.   And that's a shame, because the game is visually interesting. I do wonder, however, why it gives letters with some semblance of a story if it goes nowhere, explains nothing, and results in more questions of why I spent two hours playing through it.   So If $5 is worth 2 hours of your time, you'll probably like this. If not, I'd skip this one. It's not bad, but it doesn't leave you with anything other than a feeling of 'yeah that sure was a thing I played.'",

It's delightful to look at, with each puzzle 'box' intricately detailed, which is good because you spend the entirety of the game exploring them. Interactions with the puzzles have a pleasingly tactile feel, requiring you to twist keys and pull handles. That's probably a holdeover from its touchscreen origins, but it doesn't feel out of place. Some of the puzzles are brain teasers and some are simple exploration. A few are obviously simple enough to be merely brute-forced, though those are the exception. There's a plot, but it's mere window dressing. In some games you Shoot The Mans and a little plot happens sometimes; here you Solve The Puzzles and a little plot happens sometimes. If you're a veteran of puzzle games then you might make short work of The Room; I spent around 3 hours start to finish, but I got it on sale for $2.50 so it's hard to fault it for value.",

Can't forget to mention, the game is just beautiful. The hints(yeah I clicked a question mark that showed up, don't judge) don't just outright say what to do, but just act as if you are saying your 'thoughts' out loud.

I never expected such intricate details and textures in a 'simple puzzle game'! The objects just look real with the shadows, reflections, and wood grain, etc.  Puzzle-wise the game also delivers. The puzzles are numerous, unique and logical. None of the 'random connections' of some 'point-n-click' animated puzzle games. Whenever I completed a puzzle that stumped me for awhile (with only a few hints from the in-game system) I always looked back and thought to myself 'how'd I miss that' or 'I should have gotten that' and never once did I have a 'What? That makes no sense!' reaction. Great puzzles that are sometimes challenging, but certainly doable.  The only two minor 'negatives' that can really be said is 1) it's short, which leaves you wanting more of this amazing world, and 2) it's not replayable -- but that's the nature of this type of puzzle game and I accept that. So those aren't really negatives. However, even though I wasn't that interested or care for the mystical story-line, it also didn't interrupt or detract from the puzzles or the beautiful environment at all.  Despite being on the short side, it's an absolutely fabulous puzzler not to be missed! 10 out of 10.",

Visuals are quite nice if a bit sterile, and the sound design gives a nice sense of atmosphere.  Also of note is that this was originally an ipad (and iphone? Can't be bothered to look it up) only title. The port is quite nice and hasn't suffered too much from the change over, and it's clear at several points the puzzles have been tweaked to make up for the different interface. If you're hoping for acres of graphics and sound and FOV and resolution ad infinitum settings there's none of that, just your basic options. Throw tantrums at your own discretion, but I didn't see the need for any of it. It does pretend to have a story. Don't believe these lies. There may be a bit of vauge conspiracy going on in the background but it isn't up to much.

Its a puzzle game and the puzzles are entirely visual, that to me is a bit of a weakness. Really there is no brain usage for this game imo, its just put square on square to get triangle, then find where a triangle goes. Dont have all you need? well look around the box for stuff you can flip or turn or switch and there ya go.  The puzzles also often make little sense, its entirely in order and so certain stuff is linked ingame while it makes no sense that they would be outside of game mechanics. So from a realism perspective....it could do a bit better.  Also the game goes to the super natural, which is a tad generic and weak imo. It looks like you are working on a virtual version of some physical puzzle, with gears and cogs, like a complex music box or something. But in the end there is very little physical about it, there are big physical spaces in other physical spaces that in the real world would not fit.  Again, its a puzzle game which in of itself for me is a plus. Its a nice combination of oldschool and modern. I love the look and the atmosphere.

On top of the safe I notice a letter which I proceed to open merely to find a key enclosed with a very peculiar note. After reading the note I'm left completely perplexed. I look at the key I was given but I quickly begin to feel helpless when I search for a keyhole somewhere on the magnificent safe.  The key doesn't seem to fit into any of the strange openings or contraptions I spot on the safe. I start thinking less of the key and more of the safe. I begin to study the safe closely and analyze every tiny nook and cranny I can find. Suddenly, success! I found something! A tiny panel the size of a matchbox slides open...  The Room really shines in my world. I love a good puzzle game and this title certainly gets the job done. As you start the game, you notice the soundtrack playing right away. The soundtrack doesn't feel repetive and still manages to support the atmosphere it wants to create very nicely. Besides the sounds, the puzzles are fun. When you face a seemingly impossible lock with nothing but mystery, The Room challenges you to think outside the box and solve it's many riddles. The Room gives you a nice feeling when you solve a puzzle and coupled with very neat and detailed graphics, it feels genuinely satisfactory to solve a puzzle.

The puzzles were very simple, it only took 2.5 hours to beat, and the story, while not the focus, did not have a satisfying conclusion (maybe in the Room 2 it does, I don't know). The graphics and visuals were great, and that honestly the best part of this game. Coming from someone who isn't an avid puzzle enthusiast, I had no issue beating this game and never found myself stumped for more than 2-3 mins (which happened only once), I generally felt like the game was too afraid to let you try to solve any of it on your own, and any independent ideas that I came up with on my own were immediatley confirmed by the pop-up text which regularly appeared at the bottom, and the game sometimes panned you over to certain parts of the puzzle, instead of allowing you to actively find the next step (but it did this only a few times). I rarely had to actually guess what the next step was in the puzzle. There were puzzle types that were recycled atleast a few times (gears, lining up images, keys) and towards the end it felt repetitive at points.  But despite this criticism, I enjoyed how laid back and casual it was. I never got stuck, which may be bad if you enjoy challenges, but it also meant less frustration when playing through. Even though $5 was pretty cheap, I still feel like it lacked content, the whole game was 2.5 hours in total. Top marks for visual quality, sound design, and atmosphere, though. The complexity made it feel like you were unraveling steampunk contraptions, however sometimes when I got the impression that the contraptions didn't make logical sense, sometimes I felt like the creators didn't bother to try to think of how these contraptions would actually fit all of these mechanisms within its volume, instead opting to create a magical box which anything could spring out of, despite its size limitations. This is just nitpicking and I may have failed to convey just what I mean by this to anyone who hasn't witnessed the game.  I'm recommending this, despite this harsh review just because I enjoyed myself throughout the play through.",

The game lacks variety or anything resembling a difficulty curve that I could see, it's pretty much just variations on the tutorial puzzle until the end. It's a time waster. Just switch off and play the game.  I also now see that the 'fine individual' who recommended this to me has just 0.1 hrs on record. Seems like he was the smart one who fiddled with the tutorial and left with a great initial impression. The tutorial really is where this game shines.",

There is no real mental challenge in this game which I think is a serious defecit. The only challenge there is is to find the next thing you will have to click or drag. (Yea well not totally true, you have to 'reason' that a key fits a keyhole and a screwdriver turns screws etc., but that's it).  The story is aswell kinde unfinished, unpolished and way to linear.    To sum it all up: At no point during the game have I felt surprised, challenge, intruiged or anything really. The only emotion the game made me feel is annoyed if my lulled senses couldn't find the next thing to click.    If you want a game that provokes you to think; this is not the game you are looking for.  ",

I was hoping for logically intense puzzles and instead I was presented with a scavenger hunt for the next item that would open a door to give me a new item which would show this machine with more doors that needed more items… and you get my point. So as a puzzle game it didn’t really do it for me but as a point and click scavenger hunt it is by far one of the best if not the best out there. I just can’t recommend it because I was expecting something different entirely.",

As with all game reviews, please note that this is based on my own experience and is therefore subjective - I quite enjoy puzzle games, if you don't, you may not like this game.  You play as a silent protagonist, responding to a letter from a friend who has gone missing. Their behaviour has been increasingly erratic and secretive and you fear for their well-being, so upon arrival at their home you start to search for them, a search which leads you to the attic room with a small puzzle box in the centre of it.  That's the basic set-up. There is no exploration, everything takes place with a focus on the puzzle box as it is the key to finding out what has happened to your friend and it is entirely mouse controlled. You manipulate different parts of the box using the mouse and this gradually unlocks to become something that is visually surprisingly impressive - graphically the game is no slouch, despite being able to run on a modest XP setup, when put on my AMD Black/720 graphics card set up and cranked up it looks superb. Sharp, detailed and with wonderfful animations.  Sound is good, with a nice soundtrack, but I found it could be repetitive particularly when interspersed with sound-effects. It does change slightly over the course of the game and the overall quality of music is high. You do have the option to turn volume completely off and to window the game by altering the resolution using the options menu in-game or from the start menu, so you can stream music or video whilst you play if the in-game sound isn't your thing (or there's something else you want to watch).  Now to the main problems of the game, and these are two-fold: the length of the game is short and the puzzles vary wildly in difficulty. This is compounded further by some of them having slightly off controls or moments when an animation is repeated even though it isn't necessary. Moments like this feel like they've been left in as a result of padding to help fill out a very short game (I've finished it twice in 5 hours) or are the result of poor programming decisions. Later in the game some puzzles were understandly much more difficult but a few felt VERY easy and almost out of place in comparison to where I was in the game. The difficulty curve affects the game length as you can whizz through the easier puzzles once you've got the mindset for it and are used to the games logic.   The promise of further installments in the series, either as sequels or as DLC are something that I am looking forward to and I fully recommend buying this if you are a fan of puzzle games. If you want to test the water and are curious and a fan of a bit of Lovecraftian horror then you may also find a lot to like in this highly-polished, challenging but short entry to the puzzle genre.

The additional gimmick of the Lens adds a very different, almost creepy, vibe where you are peering into another world, one not quite visible to the stunted human senses and needing aid to see what is really there. The overall game is somewhat short and ripe for expansion. The puzzles are lengthy and can be obscure but you're left with an accomplished feeling (turn off the hints!) and a genuine curiousity to see the wonders that are in the next Room.

Wait for a sale - it's a good game, but I wouldn't call it a 'Must Play' But if it had more content? Hell yes. Sequel/DLC is something I would buy.   Overall verdict is that The Room is a fun little thought invoking (and immerseive) puzzle game, but is sadly short. So I'd recommend it, but getting it on sale (as I did).",

As it turns out, the game is a series of intricate puzzle-boxes. You focus on a particular part of the current box and drag the camera around to inspect. Turn knobs, lift latches, find keys, and use your special viewing lens to find clues you couldn't see otherwise.  This is the first puzzle-box game that I've really enjoyed. The controls are tight; I never felt like I was having a difficult time getting the camera where I wanted it, despite the game taking place in a 3D space.  I never played the mobile version, but the visuals in this version are downright beautiful. The wood and metal textures never look painted-on. The lighting, floating dust motes, and occasional glow effects are very believable. One of the featured tags on the store page was 'Horror', but while the music and ambient sounds add a sometimes chilling atmosphere, there's no danger or big scares in the course of the game itself. Seeing the tag made me think that the puzzle boxes might just be a vehicle for a scarier game than the trailer let on, and that wasn't the kind of game I was interested in playing at the moment.  Due to the way some of the boxes are lit, I recommend playing this one with the lights out. I also used headphones, but that was more to appreciate the atmosphere rather than having sound-based clues.  There is no achievement for speedrunning this game, so if you do play it, feel free to take your time. Being thoughtful and logical here feels more rewarding than trying to brute-force through all the puzzles. After all, the puzzles are what the game is all about.",

It's not ridiculously hard, but it's not so easy that it's boring.   Throughout the game, you are trying to unlock boxes. Sounds boring? Actually no. It's not. These boxes are so incredibly intricate and there's so much attention to small details that can benefit you later, especially with the eyeglass you're given at the start of the game. My only gripe about this game is that it's pretty short. Is there going to be a sequel or something? Because I really got into the story of the game and the ending was pretty vague.

While The Room isn't so much about THE room and more about the puzzle boxes you solve in each level, the high level of detail both in the graphic construction of the objects and how they work and the gameplay that feels as natural as if you were handling the puzzles in person is honestly amazing.   Each level gets argueably harder than the last but rewards critcal thinking that makes you excited and eager to play the next level once you finish the last. The only complaint I have is that it is so short. But bear in mind this is a very high quality port from a mobile game by a small studio that cut no corners in making and remaking the pc port and could reasonably go for 3 times as much making the mere $5 fee a steal.  Normally I would criticize a games lack of story, and to be fair there is story but it is sparse and somewhat... wanting, but it is refreshing for a game to be about to stand on its gameplay alone. Taking this under consideration, I would say, for me, this game is the best puzzle game I have played since Portal 2. Take that for what you will but, sale or not, BUY THIS GAME.",

What stars as a simple task quickly turns into a multistructured puzzle using point and click inventory system to gather items for future puzzles. The camera is fixed on one 3D object and you rotate the camera around the object and zoom in and out by clicking. This design choice is fantastic for focusing on the puzzles while still being able to build an atmosphere. The music in the game is foreboding and there is a great sense of the unknown creating tension the more you play. The puzzles themselves are top notch. The difficulty is just right being neither easy nor difficult. After about a minute a hint button appears that will give you a nudge in the right direction if you get stuck. The game length is 2-3 hours but for the budget price its well worth your money. My biggest gripe is the cliffhanger ending and the sequel not being on steam.

One down side to the game is that I needed to use the hints, not so much for the puzzles, but for finding hidden compartments on the weird safe, in spots you wouldn't expect them to be. All I can recommend is that every time you zoom in, you try and move things every way, press every spot, and spin anything that looks like it can. It may open a compartment for a key, cog or other toggle that will move you forward. This was the only thing that really held me up. Definately worth a playthrough though!",

There's already a third game in the making, and I'm hoping to see them all on Steam at some point, given that they are all connected by a single story.  The Room realises a childhood dream of many - myself included - of finding a strange locked box in the attic of an old house, and discovering something wonderful, possibly a well-guarded secret, hidden away for millennia, laying inside. Like any kid, however, I had to eventually say goodbye to this dream of mine, when, after dragging the heavy box outside of my gandparents' attic and then struggling with the rusted lock, my hopes of finding some lost treasure were mercilessly crushed by a bunch of dusty old shoes I found laying inside. This game, however, allows you to once again experience your childhood dream and make things right this time. No more dusty old shoes!",

            "review_text": "The Room, a port of an iOS title released in 2012 that has no relation to the cult film of the same name, is a puzzle game that sets the player through five stages with the goal of opening a box on each stage. With the aid of a lens that allows for the discovery of secrets, the player solves three-dimentional puzzles in an attempt to discover the truth behind the mysterious box.  The Room is a game that presents it puzzle solving with atmosphere, simulating the sound, visual, and mental state of various escape rooms requiring actual people to escape a room with hints and clues. There is alot of critical thinking that requires observation and memory in order to solve each puzzle. If by any chance a player is stuck or lost, the hint system will gradually point the player towards the next step without giving away the solution.   It is worth noting that the game is only going to be played through once or on occasion, as the game will be compleated in roughly two hours with no replay value after the end. It is also worth noting that as a result of being an iOS port, the game and actions are designed for touch controls, making the mouse support feel at times stiff. The stiff controls at times is not critical, but only requires the player to adapt.   The Room is a great puzzle game that is worth playing if you are curious about what the puzzle genre or escape rooms feel as an experiance. If you see it on sale, it is worth checking out and playing through for a day.",

The Room (note: not based on the films The Room or Room!) is a point and click puzzle game that will be familiar to anyone who has played a room escape video game or done a live action room escape. You are in the haunted attic of a mansion and you find an elaborate and ornate box. By flipping levers and dials, pressing buttons, putting keys in locks, and generally fiddling you slowly open more and more of the box and learn about the secret of the room. The plot is mostly flavour and mood rather than a concrete narrative. Puzzles are fun and generally fair. The game looks gorgeous. At 2-3 hours, I think the game is priced appropriately.",
