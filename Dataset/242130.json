            "review_text": "Let's start with a simple fact: this game is not perfect. It's not even amazing, nor great. It is buggy like hell, tedious with its menu interface, annoying when it crashes and, in all honesty, shallow with content.  But where Vector Thrust shines will be enough for people who are just looking for one thing - simple, plain, fast-paced dogfight action. The game is a perfect example of a title that you can play for an hour or so a day, on a break from duties or between other games. And to be honest, it has all the features it needs - the flight experience in Vector Thrust is just fantastic. The plane acts like you imagine it would, has the proper weight and feel to it. Guns and missiles are done really well and splashing a sidewinder into enemy's face is really damn satisfying.   There's a nice variety of fighters - even if most of them are reskins, or slightly different meshes, they all pilot differently and can carry a huge array of various load. And if that's not enough, then one of the game's strongest sides is the modding community - there's quite a lot of skins and there are even entire fighters (Morgan! &lt;3) that you can download. So far I had no problems with mods too.  All in all, I can't recommend VT to everyone, all the negative reviews here are a proof why. But if you turn a blind eye to the early-accessy feel to the game and give a little trust to the developer, who constantly, though slowly, adds new stuff, then you get a great relax-issuing title, with one thing that it does amazingly well. If you're a fan of fighter combat and don't mind the fact that the campaigns barely work, you might just get a few really good hours with skirmish or multiplayer. Especially if you find it on a Steam sale (recently VT was 40% off, that's a good deal).  Also, a tip: learn to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AOA Limiter. The game doesn't point that feature at all, unfortunately, but it's only when you turn it off and let the G-Forces flow through the plane that you feel like a real ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ace, swinging in aerobatics toe to toe with foes.",

            "review_text": "This game is an early access title that was rushed out the door. It fails horribly at being a spiritual successor to ace combat or being a clone. The controls are sluggish and they sometimes dont work at all. The game has so many bugs and it crashes a lot. The performance is horrible. Updates are very slow. Even for being on sale for $6.24 its not worth getting.  If you want a game that is even remotely fun get Ace Combat Assault Horizon on sale. Better yet find a PS2 and see if you have a store near you that sells old games.  I got Air Combat, Ace Combat 4, Ace Combat 5, and Ace Combat Zero at Vintage Stock.",

            "review_text": "Unfortrently, i can't recommend this game yet, this is something i'd strongly suggest putting on your watch list and buying it later. I feel as if the game has been released a little too early and there are still issues from the Early Access still plaguing today, due to what appears to be the publisher making the developer release the game earlier than he would like it. I'd wait a few months down the line and see what kind of shape the game will be then, it still feels very 'Early Access', even though it's been 'fully released'.   Honestly, I'm not too sure what to think about Vector Thrust right now, and it would require more experementation to figure out what the key issues is, if you come expecting this to be a direct Ace Combat clone, you will run into a few problems since the game doesnt play like a direct Ace Combat clone. I don't think it helps that your starting planes are so low tier that you won't have a real clue on how the flying feels like until you go through challanges to unlock each plane seperately, and there are a lot of aircraft to unlock, perhaps too much at a glance. Plus, there are some challanges that are either just pure broken or harder than it should be, that doesnt really help things.  I think whats throwing so many people off is that its not a direct Ace Combat clone, because of that. You end up playing this in the Ace Combat mindset and it ends up backfiring. This might have something to do with the flight model, or the planes. Or just the game in general. I'm not too sure.  Let me do a proper review in the future, i'd really need to put more time into it but as of right now. I really can't recommend buying this right now, especially with the asking price being nearly £20, in the state that its in right now.   Sorry, TimeSymmetry. I really didnt want to give you a negative review right now, seeing how you've been working on this since mid 2011, and what you have done is great. But it's still got some blatent issues that still show that Early Access mark, i hope you can fix up the game more in the future so it feels like a proper released game. I'll review the game near the end of the year and we'll see what happens then.",

            "review_text": "normally i really hate to leave negative reviews because i feel that all developers that know they only made a half game will finish it.  But as an air simulator developer my self and part of the development of many air sims (india devs)  i see it hard for this game to ever be finished, its like they update it every month but the update only works for a decent amount of people. becuase my version dont seems to get any of all the features that shows in the updates log,   and they seems to have been laying a huge amount of their time in the aircraft development and skins but somehow they never make it to the game?  normally this is the best part of an arcade aircraft game, but why make new planes when the old ones or the games basics isn't even half done yet?  it is like battlefield 4 that were making new dlc's even through half the game was buggy and unfinished, they did fininsh f the game now however after alot of people complained.   my solid point is, i think this game was made of people like me that loves aircraft games and wanted to make their own, to conmtrol it and keep it alive, but where they seperate from me is that i complete the things i began and dont stop before it is 100% ready.  ( and no i will not post any links to the games i developed or been helping with as that is against the steam policy to promote other products)   been following it since alpha release on steam and were following it, on moddb when they first began, were afraid to buy it on moddb as it looked like a casual half done work but when it came on steam i had to try this out, because steam's policy was quite good when this game came on here, but to end this review  It is a decent game, but too overpriced compared to it stability and development, and many other flight sims can be released before this actually gets out of an real alpha state, because this is not a full release or a beta, and i know that.   but try it out on a sale you will enjoy it for 4-5 hours and that is it,    And no it doesn't look like ACE COMBAT at all, and i've been in contact with them for a long time and been a fan of their games, since 1998  ",

Now... good points. -It can get fun once you get used to it -Modern jet plehns.  -Not as hard to play as DCS.  -Not as grindly as War Thunder, and no sparking for once.  I'd recommend the game, but only if you really want to play a modern jet game that's arcady and easy to play. If you want a sim and have money to burn go play DCS. ",

            "review_text": "Vector Thrust is an Ace combat clone that doesn't understand what made Ace Combat fun in the first place.   If I had to sum it up in one word: Tedious. The missions are long, boring, grinds that see you thrown up against seemingly endless waves of enemy fighters; which would be great if the combat was in any way enjoyable or varied. The frusterating, overly-long missions lack checkpoints, targeting enemies involves cycling through every single target on the map (no prioritiziation based on range), and your missiles are nearly inneffective against manuvering targets.   You're better off dragging your PS2 out of the closet, or buying one from a thrift store, and playing the real thing.   ",

I don't know why people comparing with Ace Combat, i've played ace combat:AH and i didn't like it at all...well it has 'flashy' grapihics, but that's about it. It has a nice collection of planes (and they'll introduce more).  Challenges to unlock planes are good (some of them buggy, but you can override or just pay pass points to buy the plane). Skirmish mode...i love skirmish mode, you can dogfight for hours (you make the settings about opponents/time/win conditions/type of match). You can create/edit missions in the editor...  You can edit everything...even tweak the fly models a bit and armament. So i can say someone can make it more 'realistic' ( not Realistic-realistic like DCs realistic) or even more arcade...  The only bad thing so far is that the campaign lacks things here and there...and...it just needs more. Also skirmish mode needs a ground strike mode or something (because i haven't found any if it has...but still you can tweak things in edit and create something like that). The other bad thing - if you can call it bad- is the lack of mouse aim control. So you'll either have to play with keyboard or just get a gamepad.  I really like it for what it is (arcade sim?)... and i think the developers are making a good job so far.   ",

The only thing I liked about the game was the design of all the jets and the amount of aircrafts they said are in the game. This game should have never left EA yet, but if they fix theses issues and add a workshop for mods I think it will be a success.  くそー、私は巨大なエースコンバットファン（1-5、PSPのバージョン）と蒸気の交流がガベージですけど、このゲームはあっても、交流のPSP版に近い来ていないということで、このゲームを愛したかったです。愛の物語＆ボイスアクターが退屈している、マップはコントロールがスムーズではない、死んで退屈している、詐欺、音楽は当たり障りのないです。  私はゲームについて気に入っ唯一のものは、すべてのジェットの設計、彼らはゲームであると述べた航空機の量でした。このゲームはまだEAを残したことはないはずですが、彼らは論文の問題を修正し、改造のためのワークショップを追加する場合、私はそれが成功になると思います。",

The Game engine panics in and causes problems executing OpenAL.  Did I mention game breaking bugs?  Sometimes the controls feel unresponsive or slow ( using a gamepad )    I would recommend this game on a sale but not full-price, it's honestly a bad business for a consumer to buy this expecting a fully working game and find that sometimes it just will not work.",

            "review_text": "Purchased this day one early access, and am appauled that this game is out of early access in such a bad state! There are so many issues and things that the dev's have said that they where working on many many many months ago that have yet to be patched in. The game features virtual cockpits, but the only one that shows up currently is the F-16's with no textures, there was also suppose to be better animations with the aircraft including thrust nozzle movement. We have yet to have those included/ fixed.   Also As the game the game progressed it became more and more rediculous with hit detection/ weapon stregnths/ missle accuracy/ gun accuracy. It only takes 2 - 3 bullets to shoot your plane down, but millions to down an enemy, to add, you can line up your gun piper with the leading target sight and miss due to the accuracy of your gun, it's almost as iff the gun piper is not centered to the gun. Now for the missles..... the most inaccurate thing in the game. The enemy doesn't even need to turn or drop countermeasures the missle just lose track for no reason and fly off in another direction. Enemy bombers take about 10 - 14 missles to shoot down, which in the second mission you have 12 of them to down and only 40 missles, mind you, bombers have turrets and 2 bullets to your plane equals sht down so don't even try guns.   With honesty, this is a huge let down because of the lazy dev team, it could have been a proper ace combat like game for the PC platform. Do not by this game, and those who have, I suggest we all ask for a refund, we did not get what was promised by the devs.",

Don't rush in to it expecting a full finished game. With that being said the game is being updated and is continually improving. From what I see, the developer is taking notes and listening to player feedback.  Secondly, forget everything about other flight games/simulators before playing this. Still images are used during cutscenes similar to older Ace Combat games but that's where comparisons should end. Everything is a mix of arcade and realism which I like but most other people seem to hate. Its arcadey with stable flying and a payload of about 50 missiles per mission but you're able to do things like turn off the AoA limiter to do post-stall maneuvers while launching chaff and flares to dodge a missile at the last second.  Its a unique game and it is a game I'm enjoying. The underlying game is brilliant, just needs more content and polishing. Looking forward to further updates!  EDIT: There are more similarities between this and AC series. The world is similar to Strangereal and ace squadrons have introductions among other things but it's not a clone.",
