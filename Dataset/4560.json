            "review_text": "(Something to quickly note first - Don't let the amount of time I have put into this game misguide you. This review was actually meant for Company of Heroes (New Steam Version) which I have put over 120 hours into but for some reason, you cannot do reviews of it and can only do reviews for COH itself as well as its two expansion packs.)  Alright, enough dilly-dallying. Let's get this show on the road.  When it comes to games that try to capture the hard, bloody and steely conflicts of World War II then one game usually comes to mind (my mind that is) and that is Company of Heroes.  A game I would easily consider to be one of the greatest RTSs of all time alongside the likes of Age of Empires II, Rome: Total War, Men of War and Dawn of War (So many wars!). I would also say it is one of my own personal favourite games of all time.   Set in the western front of the European Theatre of World War II. Company of Heroes sees the US Army (As well as the British Army with Opposing Fronts installed) and the Wehrmacht (As well as the Panzer Elite {Waffen SS in reality} with OF installed) battling each other for the control of France and the Netherlands in the numerous conflicts and engagements of that era.  Company of Heroes is a game that just does so many things right when it comes to strategy. It has a user friendly interface and easy to learn controls which are key to any strategy game in my opinion – both real-time and turn-based – and gives a really realistic and striking depiction of the war. It has easy to understand game mechanics and it is quite literally a blast to play as it takes little time before the action begins and gets intense real fast when there is so much happening at once in devastating and explosive fire fights.  When it comes to its gameplay, it seems fairly simple enough. You start off with a single building for a base and a group of engineers (your builders in the game), a big map to explore and expand into as well as using what resources you can secure from the area to use so you can try to build up your base and call in what units or support options you need to attain victory, such as infantry, paratroopers, special weapons teams, armoured cars, medium and heavy tanks, artillery barrages, P-51 strafing runs and V1 Rocket strikes etc. It’s your standard RTS mash up.  This game is the epitome of how a strategy game should play out; rather than just the usual strategy game method of having larger numbers than the other guy (Although that certainly helps in this game). COH requires you to utilise your given surroundings, putting soldiers in buildings and environmental cover to give them an edge in the fight while also attempting to use your units special abilities like throwing grenades and sticky bombs or using flamethrowers to try and maximise enemy casualties.   Maybe trying to exploit certain tactics like flanking maneuverers, suppression of an enemy squad, going around the back of an enemy tank and hitting it in its vulnerable sides and rear armour or trying to hold onto a strategic position with well-placed fortifications, traps and emplacements. That is what real strategy and tactical prowess is about and COH does it beautifully.   This means that you must be cunning and always planning for the unexpected, always being one step ahead of the opposing commander. Be ready for when the enemy comes charging at you with everything they have while calling in whatever long range assets they can muster against your forces.  Graphics are decent, they may not be all the way up there when compared to the likes of StarCraft 2 or the Total War games but they do the job as far as I’m concerned and still hold up pretty well to this day. When you see an artillery barrage devastate a patch of land, turning it into a series of craters while a nearby squad of soldiers gets blown apart (literally) by the shrieking shells all the while screaming that “They don’t want to be there, they just want to go home, man!” then I would definitely say that the graphics and audio department have very much done their job to the nth degree.  There are problems with the game though. The AI is questionable at times with enemies running entire platoon sized forces into fortified positions without trying to soften up the defenders with artillery or anything first, more often or not I saw the spamming of the same unit over again from my AI controlled enemies also while not trying to diversify their unit types to counter any certain units I had. The AI also cheats sometimes, knowing exactly where to call in an artillery barrage on your units despite that the fog of war would prevent them from knowing their exact location. The campaign(s) are quite scripted and often don’t present much of a challenge, even on the harder difficulties.   It’s not a perfect game by any means but I still recommend it for all the good I have mentioned above and hope this review can help your perspective should you think about purchasing it.  On the side as well, I just want to say that this game has some of the best voice acting I have ever heard with soldiers spouting some really emotional and funny dialogue with professional voice talent provided from the likes of Steve Blum and of course, dear old Nolan North. Somehow the creators even managed to work in some humorous fourth wall breaking dialogue as well, my favourite having to be from a British Infantry Section, “Excuse me, sir, would you mind not clicking me anymore?” or “Oi! Get your bloody hands off the mouse!”   And if you do ever think about getting Company of Heroes then I highly recommend that you download the Blitzkrieg mod which amplifies the game like 10 times in terms of gameplay and player choice, making it even more gripping and awesome to play.  So there you have it. Sorry about the length of this review but I simply had to put down what I liked about this game, which unfortunately was a lot….sorry.   Have a good day, sir or madam.   Quote of the day - “We’re f*cked, crew! Command is drunk again!” - US Artillery crewman.",

The modding community has also had its hand in making CoH fantastic, my favorite being the Blitzkrieg Mod which makes the game brutal and glorious.

            "review_text": "This is a review for CoH New Steam Version (You'll get it when you buy this game, New Steam Version is the way to play this old game, so that all element on the game would work)   I generally suck at RTS game. I think I can count on finger, how many RTS game I played and truly enjoy. I still suck on all of them   Company of Heroes is a RTS game that have element of building production structure and training your army. Upgrade is researchable, and each of your army unit may have an ability. Compared to other similar game like Man of War or Sudden Strike (I have minimal experience with those), CoH is lot less complex on unit micro management. CoH instead play out on the flow of battlefield, where your units are, where the enemies, what should you do after engaging a skirmish. Getting to know this is the way to win, at least thats what I (who sucks at RTS) thinks.  CoH have a lot of war element detail on a less unit-management game style. Infantry might get suppressed when they're in no-cover area, vehicle might be damaged on a number of parts that might hinder their performance, and iirc building that's on fire will have it's health decreasing as time pass by. A faction have doctrine subtrees, where a player can specialize on what tactic it brings on the battlefield. The range of infantry and vehicle the player can used spans from the early WW2 to almost the end of the period. It's generally a land combat type unit you can control. Fighter plane exist but only as a form of commander strike ability. Playing against other player is great, but those who prefer to spend a free time stomping out CPU/AI enemy will find good time battling them out. The vanilla game plays out really well, and if you're already bored with it, there are 1-2 mod out there that brings out new way to play.   I recommend to buy the CoH Complete Pack, one that have CoH and its 2 expansion, Opposing Front and Tales of Valor The full price might shy people away from this 2006 old game, but a discount will help alleviate this. Up to 50% cut is considered a good deal for me, with what the amount of hour you'll dump to this game.",

Company of Heroes manages to mix the two styles quite well, particularly the presence of structures makes the blend between macro and micro much more smooth than in other THQ new style games where it's all micro.  The graphics are strong and the music is decent. The single-player campaign is well made although the storyline and cut-scenes are something I could do without.  Company of Heroes is a good game, by no means a great game, but a good solid title that can be thoroughly enjoyed by any fans of the genre. The multi-player does get a little stale however.",

But that doesnt mean this game is bad, it just means its annoyingly difficult.  Oh and dont try to cheat - The one time I simply had to turn off the game was because I built tank traps spanning the width of the map and the AI - instead of shooting them apart - drove through them, It was horrible to see but I guess if you cheat the AI will cheat back.",

Besides the awesome next-gen graphics and audio (from 2007), the gameplay gets the golden hot doge award. There hasn't ever been a game with so much flexibility and open-endedness as CoH. If the terrain gets mangled from annoying-♥♥♥ Kraut artillery and your troops don't have cover, then it's time to build some cover! The terrain is very malleable and destructible; bridges, buildings, fences, hedges, people, trees, you can blow it all up! Or if you want to hold the line, fortify it! It's a dream come true for a strategy lover like me. Oh, that's another thing. Even though the AI is sketchy at times, strategy is a big key to success. The AI has a bad habit of spamming ungodly and relentless amounts of tanks or infantry (or both) should you provide the resources to them, so it can become a bit strategy-lacking at times unless you're an antisocial person who likes fighting computers. I love RTS games with all of my heart, yes so sweet and beautiful it is to command armies of people and watch them fight to the death. I do find the unit selections a bit 'limited' even though it's all you need to survive and get the job done. This is where the glory of mods come in! Mods add countless new units and functions into the game, a few even add new factions! Don't like something about the game or a mod? That's not a problem, learning how to mod the game yourself is easier than remembering 3.1415926535897932384! I've wasted days playing this game and I'm glad to have wasted my time with such a fun game. It's a legendary game in the world of RTS, and it remains my favorite RTS in the world to this day.",

Even though these points are vital for the economy side of the game, taking and maintaining these points requires a lot of focus on the size and positioning of one's military.   As far as military units go, the game is just like any RTS game. You have light (infantry), medium (light vehicles), and heavy units (tanks) and counter units to different units in those classes. There are also three different branches for the Allies and Axis factions to choose from that will support you in commanding your troops on the battlefield. Support such as off-map artillery, increased abilities for units, and special units can be utilized to give you that extra edge against the enemy.   Like I said, I would recommend buying this game not only because of the gameplay, but the amazing graphics and audio are a definite plus to the gameplay experience. Happy gaming! ",
