Nice story, cool intro and outro movies, well balanced puzzles: not too hard and not too lame, you can solve everything by using your brain, but you won't need to go into annoying pixel-hunting. A really great work from such a small group of game makers. Keep on bringing more titles like this!",

It is straight-forward, easy to understand, believeable story of using your wits to survive and escape the plaent you are marooned on. There is no pixel hunting, no filler puzzles, and no carzy 'who would ever do that' moments.  Atmospheric sights and sounds. Limited back and forth to locations, none of which is designed merely to fill the time. It includes trading cards amd achievements if that matters to you. The only negative I found personally is that it is too short. I would have happiily player many more hours of this game if I could.  If you like adventures you will like this!",

            "review_text": "Your starship gets caught in some sort of magnetic disturbance, and your ship is pulled down onto the surface of a planet that has a reputation of being 100% dead. Funny thing is that perhaps that's not completely true, but you are going to have to find your way through this point click adventure to find out what this planet has to hide, and are you going to be able to get off this planet in one piece.  Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock is by Red Herring Labs and will take you on an hour and a half ride where you will get to explore this 'Dead Rock' and try to find anything and everything you need to potentially get off of the planet. You will have to combine items, find items, and fix issues in order to advance the game.  The one thing that I can honestly say that ended up bugging me about the game was the EXTREMELY deadpan voice of the lead actor in the game. He definitely had the almost monotone approach of not getting a damn about anything as well as never being shocked or excited about anything. That's not to say that the other voice actor was that much better, but at least they gave a little bit of feeling to the game.  I liked the look of the game, and it was pretty straightforward in how you navigated around. You are going to see almost always 1 single view of a room or an area, there might be deeper parts of the area/room that you can explore and get a new vantage point on, but this is definitely not a game where you are going to have to search every nook and cranny to find what you are looking for.  Once again, perhaps its my time away from point and clicks until recently, but there is a hint system in place, and it was good to see that it was actually useful with out making me feel dumb. There were a couple of times where I struggled to find out what to do next, but thanks to the hint system I was able to easily get back on track.  I can honestly say the further I got into the game, the more I actually got into the game. What I mean to say is that it took me a little bit of time to find the pace, but when I finally found the pace of the game I was ready to move. It was unfortunate that once I got up to speed I found the end of the game, but hey it says something that I had no issue of playing the game straight through.  So I guess the question now is should you get this game... Well I think if you are looking for something light, has a futuristic space theme, is a point click adventure built around survival, you are going to enjoy this game. As I mentioned before the only big issue I had with it was the voice acting of the main character, and before anyone asks, there are really only 2 voice actors, so that sort of didn't do it for me, but then again it wasn't like he talked the entire time. This game gets a 7.5 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "Morningstar: Descent to Deadrock is a very good point and click adventure where you must explore areas of an alien planet in order to repair your crashed ship and save yourself and your captain.  The immersion factor is high, despite the static screens. It is refreshing to play a P&amp;C game where the puzzles are logical for the most part, requiring thought as opposed to madly trying every inventory object on everything. The game world feels realistic within the realm of intelligent science fiction. For the most part, the voiceovers (the player character and the injured captain) are solid with only the occassional odd line reading.   One caveat for prospective buyers is that the game is relatively short; I achieved 100% in three hours, and I don't believe any achievements are missable. However, I feel that this is actually a good thing; the game doesn't feel bloated with ridiculous puzzles and there's hardly any backtracking. The MSRP of ten dollars is definitely worth it for the experience, especially compared to the price of a movie ticket and the length of a typical movie.  There is a demo available (and a free Flash version of the original), so if the premise and trailer appeal to you, there's no risk to try before you buy.",

            "review_text": "Pleasing, simple, if short point &amp; click game. Figure about 2 hours to complet + all achievements.   Very nice artwork and a cool, not too over-dramatized atmosphere. Although you run across dead crew here and there, the game wasn't too gory and annoying, except maybe the captain's initial condition.   The voice work ranges from very good to quite poor, usually it's quite good but it boggles me when a voice actor doesn't know which word receives emphasis in a phrase... I can only imagine it's a general lack of reading proclivity. It happens in many games with voiceovers and this one more than usual. Still, most of the time it's fine.  The puzzles are generally easy but fairly satisfying. It's mostly linear but you do get to roam a few locations sometimes to look around and try things.   The rapport between the captain and protag is mostly good but a little cheesy at times. And a bit of animation on the captain woul have helped, it felt like you were talking to a painting at times.   Anyway I enjoyed it and finished it in 2 sittings. There was only one poor puzzle part I got stuck on, the ventilator near the generator.  But I can recommend this as a nice, short point &amp; clicker.",

The puzzles are a bit confusing sometimes and if you want to solve everything by yourself you will have a playtime over 6 hours. That´s cool if you like the genre. If you just want to have a time killer you should buy this game when it´s on sale. Sole minus: The voice actors could have put a bit more enthusiasm into their sentences. Overall a good 'rainy-day' game.",

The puzzles are fairly easy with a few tougher ones thrown in to keep you thinking (these normally involve using more than 1 part to solve the puzzle)   Pros; Storyline is fine, graphics &amp; sound effects are ok, easy game for you achievment hunters to score 100% as your progression through the story automatically unlocks them.  Cons; Very short game, even a thicko like me completed it in under 4 hours, more experienced players will be around the 2 - 3 hour mark.   No replay value so only buy it during a sale to get the best value for your money.",

I enjoyed the story for what it is - feels like they thought about the world, but it doesn't go too into detail beyond the scope of the game itself.

It may not satify someone who's looking for something a bit more challenging, and like other reviewers, I would definitely reccomend getting it on sale. It took me about 3 hours and I even the sale price of $5 that I got it for, may have been a bit much. Definitely a fun title though. I love the sci-fi genre in general, but I have never been a big strategy enthusiast and most space games seem to have gameplay that is mostly built around in-depth strategy. I wish there were more quality less strategy intensive sci-fi games like this on the market.",
