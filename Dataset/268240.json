After 4 hours of playing and getting 100% I was going to uninstall it but it turned out that there is one more final chapter. And well... That last one was challenging and definitely worth playing. I felt like it was a different game.  tl;dr version:   6/10, worth playing if you don't have anything better to do.",

            "review_text": "Mechanic Esape is a fun, but challenging, plaftormer game that follows the escape of what looks like a tv mechanic as they try to escape the world they are trapped on.  With four main worlds and different hazards in each one, the gameplay is varied, and the difficulty of levels is fairly well balanced with some easy and some quite dificult. Of course, the real challenge is collecting each and every one of the smaller tvs before finishing the level.  Played with a controller, I did find it difficult initially to get my head around the momentum of the players character. The gravity seems less present than in other games, but once you figure it out and get used to it the game plays pretty well. It can be frustrating at times when the character drifts in certain directions, but this game is meant to be played fast rather than slowly (this effect is less noticeable at high speeds). This is when played with an xbox 360 controller, which works great.  The graphics in this game are very nice, with differing styles in each world, and nice details on the player character and the enemies that follow you around. The music is nice initially, but I began to tire of it fairly quickly, as it plays on a constant loop.  Aside from the intially odd momentum and gravity the player has, I had no major bugs. worth noting however: If the flying enemy that shoots bullets is within a wall, it can fire bullets that pass through the wall without exploding. Watch out for that.  This is a veyr nice game, and definitely worth buying if you like platformers that play at high speeds.",

            "review_text": "I must say I have been thoroughly surprised by Mechanic's Escape. I expected something to simply satisfy my precision platforming itch, not something that, to some extent, blows me away and is so much fun to play.   So far, I've played 30 levels out of 80, so I can't talk about the overall difficulty, but I expect it to get pretty hardcore in worlds 3 and 4. The first world (20 levels each world) was pretty easy, and seasoned platformers should be able to perfect it completely in under an hour. However, from the last level of the first world to the first of the second world, you can already see that there's a marked jump in terms of difficulty. It's also worth noting that there are NO checkpoints, so you restart each time you die from the beginning. The good thing though is that the levels are mostly around 45 seconds long each.   The jumping is a bit floaty, but that's the nature of the game. In the first world, this won't matter much, but in the second, as things heat up and the collectibles are less straightforward, you'll need to take awhile to completely grasp it. I wouldn't count this against the game...that's just the learning curve here.  One thing I love about Mechanic's Escape is that (so far at least) the collectibles are 'get-able'. Some games tend to over-complicate the placement of the collectibles, but here, you can see most of them (none are really hidden) and it's usually just a matter of timing your jumps well or trying alternative ways to navigate the section to get them.   Art looks great. The cartoonish visuals and theme is simple and not out-of-the-world, but nice to look at all the same. Sound design is serviceable for me. Nothing particularly memorable, nor anything bad.   The mechanics here are just moving left/right, and then jumping (double-tap to double jump). So yeah, pretty straight-forward. But the game adds new gameplay elements from time to time, such as rails, canons, air vents and electro-circuits, alongside new obstacles and enemies.  One novel addition to other platformers of its kind is that each level here usually has one or two boss sequences. The boss starts chasing you, so you have to navigate said sections quickly until a laser zaps said boss. It doesn't feel gimmicky at all to me and actually adds a sense of urgency (and a bit more challenge) to the game.   Overall, I am plenty pleased with this. It surpassed my meager expectations, for sure. It has that addictive 'one more try' going for it. The nature of the game means that this is obviously tailored to the hardcore gamer that can withstand bouts of deaths trying to get that one elusive collectible, or making that one particular jump. Or well, to those who just love shouting profanities at their deaf monitors every 30 seconds!  UPDATE: I have played more now (50 levels already out of 80), and I can say with certainty that this is not as challenging as Super Meat Boy, Giana Sisters TD or Electronic Super Joy. This is good for me actually since I found the aforementioned games a tad too frustrating.   It is still a challenging precision platformer, just not as hardcore as the ones I mentioned above (which makes this an ideal game to start with if you've never played precision platformers). This could both be a pro or a con, depending on you. Getting all collectibles becomes much harder though, so it also depends if you just want to complete the levels or perfect them.",
