With its simple graphics, 12LoH2 uses old greek mythology to convey a simplistic story. But in all honesty, you're not here for the story or the graphics. You probably want a cheap game that'd keep you occupied for a few hours. It's a solid game that requires a minimal amount of thought. It took me 9 hours to 100% it. Also, it runs really well on almost anything.  During the sale, definitely get it. It even has trading cards that pay about 25% of the price by themselves.",

            "review_text": "  12 Labours of Hercules II provides two ways of playing through it. A casual path for gamers that like to relax playing easy games in their free time. Or a challeging one which will prove to be a very big challenge for all the achievement hunters from around the world, as they have think rapidly, beat time scores and have fun at the same time.  The concept is still the same as the first game of the series. A time management game in which you have to gather resources to help you build farms, workshops or gold mines. Which after, it will help you gathering more and more resources to reach the goal of the level. The funny part is that now Hercules doesn't sleep anymore but he's rather waiting there until you can send him to work, like moving rocks in the most part.  The second installment from the series prepares for the fans of the game some new features like new scenarios, 22 new achievements to beat, 40 more levels to play through, original minigames to keep you pumped, a new type of enemies and the ability to beat a score made by the very own developers of the game. But not only that, this time Hercules must confront against the goddess Hera, who has been set up as the new villain. Hera has released a wild Cretan Bull into the world and it's up to our hero and his workers to overpower various obstacles, find this bull and tame it.    Pros",

            "review_text": "This time management game continues on from where the last one left off. It focus's on Hercules 7th labor of penance according to the real myth which was to kill a cretan bull that was going around terrorising Crete. In the real myth Hercules stangles it with his bare hands. In game i think he gets it to roll over and gives it a belly rub or something. Must confess I wasn't paying much attention to the story.  The mechanics of this one if fairly much the same as the previous. The only exception being that a puzzle piece is hidden on each map for you to find. Which when you find them all will unlock four more levels.  44 Levels, 4 of which involve some sort of boss fight or minigame. These minigames are easy to get a perfect achievement on in comparison to how infuriating they were in the previous one. However this does not mean that achievement hunters like myself will not come across some aggrevating predicaments.   If you are an achievement hunter then i STRONGLY suggest the following. Place the difficulty on the easiest setting. Complete five maps and find the puzzle piece in that map. Do not log out when you have found the puzzle piece as you MUST complete the map you are on. Once you have the 5 puzzle piece achievement, turn the difficulty of the maps up and start earning three stars on all the maps. Remember you have to get all achievements on one profile. Hopefully that will save you from doing two or three walkthroughs of this game like I had to.  Last thing worth mentioning is the fact that they have added a Developers record time which you must pass at least ten times. This is actually quite challenging and makes a good addition for the game. In a nutshell a fun game to pass some time on if your looking for something that will have you in a click frenzy. With all the running around the servants do while wearing short toga's, all I've got to say is this 'thank God they wore underwear back then'.",
