            "review_text": " Disclaimer:  I bought a Desura copy of the game in a bundle a while ago and was provided with a steam key by the dev free of charge. Like other reviewers I was also approached by the dev via email who asked me to write a review of the game in exchange for several more keys -- an offer which I declined. I will, however, still leave a review so feel free to skip the rest if you think I am biased because of the above.  With that said, StarFence is a simple turrent defence game in which you place turrets (manually-controlled) to shoot down incoming ships to protect a space station. Progressing through missions unlocks more difficult enemies and other turrents and/or defences to use. The basic turrents all aim towards the mouse cursor and can be placed anywhere on the screen to plan out lines of fire. Turrets can be destroyed however, and enemies target them just as happily as the space station so some thought should be put into their placement.  There seems to be a decent variety of defences and power-ups available -- automated laser turrets, friendly ships, mines, asteroids (walls), fire rate boosts, double fire, station shield, etc. Each turret can also be upgraded for arbitrary 'upgrade points' which are gained during each stage and persist across the campaign stages -- e.g. with rotation speed upgrade since by default turrets rotate sooooo slow.  Speaking of the campaign -- things start off really slow. In fact I was not sure if I could be bothered to finish the first few levels, but the game picked up the speed a few stages down the line. It gets more frentic and challenging with each campaign mission, though I have yet to get to the end so can't say just what the end game looks like. There's no story to the campaign past a simple 'you're under attack, defend yourself with these'.  Game also offers a survival mode that pits a wave after wave of enemies against the defences and I can see this being a decent pastime for fans of arcade games.   In terms of presentation it's a simple 2D top-down game with static sprites moving across the screen or rotating. Laser-based projectiles look like glow-sticks hurtling through space and rockets resemble javelins with their long exhaust trails. It's not bad though, simple but agreeable and not too harsh on the eyes.  Would I recommend it? Yeah, kinda. I'd say it's a 'for fans of genre only' kinda game. If you like the sound of an arcadey turret defence game and need something to now and then offer distraction from other games then yeah, this might be worth the while at $5.",
