            "review_text": "Decent gameplay, the main reason to bother with it is for all the crazy 80's and early 90's references. There are a few internet meme's strewn throughout and it's all very welcome in my books.  The retro game references are just superb though, with an entire section dedicated to the original TMNT NES cartridge among others, it's a blast to just experience the game as a whole.  The game had a lot of love put in to it, the music is incredible and I had to download the soundtrack afterwards and I still listen to it every once in a while.  Definitely worth a sale price purchase in the 10 to 15 dollar range.  I can't say much about the controls as it basically plays like a slightly better version of the original top view GTA games (1 &amp; 2) mixed with an 8-bit NES style. The map can get a bit convoluted and collectables are a bit annoying to find even with a guide because of the shoddy graphics but it's still do-able with some focus.  The thing is you'll either love it or hate it... and if the references can't save you because you're too young to understand it, then you should probably stay away because it's all about the references, not so much about the gameplay.",

I wish more games like this would happen. Too often we get 8 bit ♥♥♥♥ with bad art and content that hides behind the excuse of 'but teh retro'. This doesn't. It's actually better than the original GTAs.  Also the music is awesome.",

            "review_text": "This game is a NES nostalgic dream. It isn't however, an NES game (just to make that clear)! It is a spoof of every game possible and it does a good job of synthesizing it together. Just get ready for both good and bad (lame) jokes.  The  storyline  follows a person named 'The Player' in which he is essentially a thug for hire. A bank heist goes wrong and The Player ends up stealing a time machine which flings him years forward. Doc Choc (another spinoff of a well known persona) comes in to help The Player recover pieces of the machine to get him back to where he belongs.The  gameplay  is like the first version of GTA. You are able to move in 9 directions and shoot relatively to your position. Weapons are in abundance and in variety from golf clubs to shotguns to the bionic commando arm. Why is there? Why not... why not. There will be situations where you will need specific weapons to accomplish certain tasks. I prefer to use the shotgun over automatics when it comes to being overwhelmed by a lot of characters. The player can choose to free-roam the city or do main missions or side-quests. The game is really over-the-top with everything it does and isn't scared to loosely knock off and ridicule other games.   Any car (or bicycle or motorcycle) can be stolen. Some cars can be modified to be given a jet engine at the back or some kind of armaments. The more you progress in the game, more modifiers become available. If you do happen to break the law, cops will chase you if you break but it isn't as tedious as the GTA series. To get the police off your back, the player needs to find a special police token that will rid them of their wanted level. This token appears randomly in areas or can be dropped by eliminating a certain amount of police forces. In addition to modding cars, the player may mod themselves as they please. Again, progressing through the story will unlock more styles. There isn't much the player can change but hair is definitely one of them as cut-scenes will show 'The Players' face. Throughout the game, there are power-ups that can be picked up to give the Player some neat abilities. These abilities can come in the form of speed or in some obscene form such as a Super Mario cape allowing your character to fly.  The  graphics  are quite basic and provide basic 8-bit fun. If graphics are imperative to you, this might bug you. Although the graphics are simplistic, it seems that the smallest of details were paid attention to. Sure, it is a simple color with a simple outline but the thought of including as much as one can is appreciated. The  sounds  follow a NES scheme. The music station can be changed (there are about 10 stations to choose from) and the sounds are appropriate for the setting. Don't expect to hear triple A explosions but you'll definitely hear everything going on in the game.  I like this game. I personally bought it on it's lowest sale price and do find the price slightly steep. If you do like this though it might be worth the purchase for you. It's good, it entertains, but doesn't try to attempt to break away from traditional gaming. I would have loved to see the game take a bit more risks with it's gameplay.    RATING : 7.25/10.

            "review_text": "Take GTA and make it 8-bit and silly as hell!  Graphics: Retro fans will drool over the 8-bit look of the game, which is nice to look at. Lots of vibrant colors and detailed areas to enjoy. And the cutscenes are well drawn and fit the feel of the game. Nothing much to complain about here.  Sound: 8-bit sounds all the way! From the sirens and gunsfire to the music, it's all 8-bit bliss. Much of the music is also nice to listen to, but you have the option to shut it off it it's not your thing. The game also has options for different filters and boarders to make it feel like you're playing it on an old tv back in the day, scanlines and all. Some of the colors filters, while nice options, can hurt the eyes after a bit.  Control: You can use keyboard/mouse or controller, but controller is HIGHLY reccomended. Controls are a bit of an issue, as the default keybinds feel weird and rebinding them is dificult. Once you get past that though, the game plays fine and control is responsive.  Gameplay: This games, despite the cartoony look, retro graphics, and hilarious story, is still a GTA clone at heart. You can mug people on the strees, collect weapons and carjack people. There are paint shops and pickups to lose the heat, and shops to buy skins and weapons. But you also get a few tricks that GTA doesn't, like speed boots, the ability to jump on enemies, add weapons to your cars, and even a time machine! The wackiness really sets this game apart from GTA! The story is also a full on omage to old retro games! The game's missions doubly so! You even have to go visit an imfamous dam from a certain turtles game! The only issue I have is that some of the missions are QUITE long and due to random difficulty spikes, will often take more than an hour to complete, and repsawns during the mission are unforgiving. I have ragequitted a few times because of this. Still, this fact does not limit the overall fun factor of the game.  I recommend this game to anyone who has or had enjoyed a GTA game, but want something more light-hearted and crazy!",

            "review_text": "This game techinically takes only a few hours to beat. However, the proper way to play is not simply to beat the game here. Nay, the true goal is to take as much tiime between missions as possible, thus increasing the playtime by at least twofold. That being said, other than the actual arcade-style games-within-a-game, the only game I've been able to come up with for this is 'See How Long You Can Survive the Police'. The story missions are quite enjoyable and provide the variety I cannot, although there really should have been more of them (especially the non-story missions). The endgame somehow manages to take away both the titular city and rampage, instead opting to throw in a tonne of combat. And then you reach the final boss. While I personally found it a pain to beat, I can only imagine the difficulty one would have with it if they hadn't played one of the aformentioned games-within-a-game. Have fun if you miss one of your incredibly specifically-timed attack opportunities!  In short Retro City Rampage is a fun game, as long as you don't put too much effort into beating it. It's fun, but doesn't have too much depth.  7/10",

Oh, and all around horrible person, Jim Sterling is in it.

Then you get to the last 10 levels or so (out of 64) and the game just becomes a bull ♥♥♥♥ sandwich. The dam level of TMNT, for example, is considered one of the worst of the NES era. So of course this game makes you do it twice. Road Blaster is one of my favorite games of all time, but the end of the game forces you to do it 6 times, wrapping up with a boss that you can only beat with luck. He has a specific pattern, but he 'cheats' in that sometimes his missles go where you are going to be, not were you were when he fired them. Sometimes, but not always. It's a violation of the boss pattern and had me throwing my controller and screaming profanities by the end of the night. The graphics are cute for about 5 minutes, then you realize you can't really tell what the hell is going on most of the time. The chiptunes are pretty good, but once the loop is over, the game won't start a new song unless you trigger a cutscene or get in a car.",

So then I decided to go and steal it from the Steam Store and it play it on my computer.  Upon actually getting into the game itself, I found myself attacked by a bunch of nerd-drawings all over the place! At first I was a little startled, then I realised that upon pressing my Xbox 360 controller's guide button, I was actually still sitting in my caddie playing on my Xbox 360! It was a little jarring to see that they had made another old game again.  So after about an hour of cursing at the game and making up my own words with the f-bomb attached to them, I decided to get really mad. I pulled the game out of my Sega Master System and threw it into my fireplace/smashed it with a hammer/made it 'explode'/cuss at it for an extended period of time/let Mike Matei play it. I then told everyone to never play this game and went back to making my feature-length movie about old games.  Thumbs up if you're an 80s kid.",

I love a good reference, but references alone do not make a game. The gameplay itself is average, and certainly nothing to write home about, but the humor was clearly supposed to carry it, and the humor just doesn't have any effort behind it. It just tries to throw thirty references at you a minute and hope that it overwhelms you with nostalgia enough that you don't notice that there's nothing else going for it.

Pixelated and chiptuned, you’ll know that exact feeling from the minute you start the game and hit the start screen.   Retro City Rampage plays more like an NES game than any other recent title I can remember, and not just from the style. The controls are tight and limited, but jumps are very hard to land. This becomes frustrating later in the game, as Mario-esque head stomps are required to dispatch certain foes. This does not translate well into 8-direction movement, as you tend to slide all over the place trying to land on a character the size of a dinner plate. Vehicle controls are fine, however, which is a benefit since you’ll spend an extended time zooming around the town in the various cars you snatch, GTA-style.   While I felt that Evoland took a good idea and didn’t take it far enough, Retro City Rampage doesn’t have that problem. The creators of the game seem to have first-hand knowledge of the golden era of videogames, and pop culture references come flying by – I’m very sure that there were several that I missed completely. Saved By the Bell, Back to the Future, Terminator, G.I. Joe, Sonic the Hedgehog – the list goes on and on, right up to recent memes that still managed to find a way in. With this amount of references, it would be an easy thing to feel inundated by all of the content being thrown at you, but I never felt like it was too much, or going too far.   There are a few difficulty spikes that are frustrating, particularly with the combat, as some enemies are simply bullet sponges that will require you to strafe and jump and shoot like a madman. There is a simple lock-on feature, but I felt it was somewhat unreliable as I tried to clear rooms of enemies. Wide-spread weapons, such as the rocket launcher, gained primary use for me, as I just had to aim in the general direction of some foes. When it came time for me to face those same weapons, however, I felt almost helpless. Plus, the end boss of the game doesn’t fit into the rest of the game’s dynamic at all – the end stages are completely based upon Rad Racer, which really serves as a knuckleball to the game’s pacing and would have served better as a side-mission somewhere else in the game.   The game has a healthy amount of content, with a few side-missions and some achievements to chase as well. You can play through the game once again in Turbo Mode once you’ve completed the adventure at least once, though personally I felt like I had my fill after the first play-through. I may return to the game down the line, for achievements, although I am satisfied with the time I spent with it.   Recommended for those who haven’t yet tired of the “new indie game in a retro style,” as long as it’s on sale. It makes for a good weekend play.",

            "review_text": "8-bit spoof supreme. Retro city rampage is a spoof of several games and movies and will throw you for a thrill ride. The easiest comparison to this game is 8-bit grandtheft auto/saints row chaos. You will classicly only have your 3 hearts as lives inwhich you'll need to find more throughout your world as you do whatever the hell you want.  This game is packed with random missions and mini-games for the player to do alongside the random main storyline of the player. Long story short, you're in a pixel world and your a ganster... GOOMBA STOMP. yes, they allow you to goomba stomp. Ontop of goomba stomping you have a large arsinal of weapons at your disposal that you will pick up between smg's pistols, cricket bats, baseball bats, crowbars and stealing peoples cars to run over masses of people.  Overview: Pros: The randomness and silly chaos of this game is exciting and never gets boring along with the dozens of chaos filled mini-games scattered about such as USE THIS TANK AND BLOW UP THINGS TO GET POINTS or use a smg to shoot as many things to get points ect. Its a relatively silly game and has spoofs that people will instantly know when they come up such as back to the future and mario's goomba stomp.  Cons: The only cons about this game that may bother someone is if you do not save frequently - this is a retro game you will lose all your things even if you have hearts remaining. This may frustrate some people as they lose their mass arsinal of weaons.  Final thoughts: when this game is on sale for a few bucks I would highly reccomend picking it up if you're into 8-bit chaos. The graphics reminds me a little of terraria and its alot of fun to casually play every so often. All and all, it was worth the $4 I spent on it and even possibly its full price.",

The best feature of the game are the dozens of different vehicles, weapons and powerups you get to use, most of which are pretty out there. You can drive the car from Back to the Future, wield a sword and shield and fling yourself in the air by farting. All of these can be used to wreak delicious havoc on the city streets.  RCR also offers a lot of bang for your buck. Aside from about 50 story missions, there's two dozen rampages (wreak havoc in a certain way), you can replay some of the sections from the missions for highscores, dozens of skins, multiple color palettes (make it look like a NES or a C64 game), you can play the original version of the game made for the NES and play mods that change the look of the game.  The game is (or was) not entirely without its faults though. While some of the story missions were great fun with a lot of variety, some were also a bit tedious or frustratingly hard. The developer has done a great job dealing addressing those issues though, issuing a few patches that made the frustratring levels more accessible. These imperfections don't ruin the game though.  In the end, the good stuff far outweighs the bad stuff. Take a look at the trailer and if you like what you see, then you won't be disappointed with how the game turns out. ",

Cons + Difficult missions  The game is pretty well made, anyone who has grown up in the late 80's and early 90's will love this game. There's a lot to enjoy here, and its well polished. I haven't seen a single bug or glitch in the game which is rare these days. The only real set back is the difficulty of the game, it tends to spike quite early in the game, I'd have liked to see different difficulty options included.
