            "review_text": "This game is AMAZING! But every game needs too improve. so here are some ideas.  1.) Make a back round that doest move with you. When you first start out in a evolution its really hard to tell if your moving or not.  2.) SAND BOX MODE!!!! When I first used the chill out mode, it relived me of alot of stress! But then i thought... What if there was a mode where it started out blank. and you had the option to add feesh and invormental stuff in it. also change the colors of stuff.  3.) add invormental stuff.  4.) Add a bunch of cool music to it! well i shoud say add a diferent song with a diferent mood with each evolution.  5.) Make it so you can see your mass (not points, mass) and otheres mass so you know if you are big enough to devour their soul or not.  5.) online mode, of course!  6.) A way to earn money and spend it on health. But you can't use that health in shark mode!  7.) If you don't like #6, then i have a solution, bubbles with hearts in the middle. but thats a little bland dont you think? I think there should be somthing else in there, the bubble.",

It's very fun, you're a fish (or a 'feesh') and basically you're trying to survive other feesh, getting bigger until you evolve. This game is very easy but it's a really good game to play in your free time. There's local multiplayer which I think is very good, I wish there was online multiplayer and maybe an easy, medium, hard option but maybe later in the future. This game is a little agar.io-ish but it's a fresh idea. Really cool game I would rate 9/10 for a $1 game and compared to games under $5 I would give this a 7.5/10. :D",
