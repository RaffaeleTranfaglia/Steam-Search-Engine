            "review_text": "Quite an interesting game. At a quick glance it might just seem an FTL-like space 'roguelike' (well, technically it came out way before FTL), but once you get into it is impossible not to notice a really distinct style and tone that make the game unique.   Flotilla pairs its rts and roguelike mechanics with a weird mixture of surreal humor and melancholic themes (we actually play as a terminal ill character) topping it all off with a beautiful yet simple art style.  Less avant-garde than Gravity Bone (Brandon Chung's previous game) but equally as smart in its execution.   7/10",

Slow paced, tactical space battles with relaxing music and some basic yet still entertaining binary decisions as you reach each planet, which will sometimes end up effecting your battles with rewards and punishments based on your decisions, or starting fights with ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ deer. The game has a Rastafarian Cat group, so what's NOT to like? Well, I'll tell what's not to like. Lasers. They're OP as ♥♥♥♥ and a laser vs laser fight is nothing but luck. The game would be better without lasers. Also the campaigns are FAR too short, you don't get nearly enough time for anything to actually happen. Overall, fantastic game.",
