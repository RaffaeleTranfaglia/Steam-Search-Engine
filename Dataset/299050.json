This game is newer and uses newer graphics engine, but the ancient Blood I is still better IMHO. Moreover, there are some bugs present in that game from the very beginning (it is not the Steam version problem) that cause game crashes. I also have to redefine some keys every launch. If you encounter 1FPS problem, switch to software rendering engine or browse the community forum for tweaks. On the other hand, I have no problems in launching the game under Windows 10 64-bit (Intel i7, Intel HD Graphics GPU + Nvidia GPU) and Steam always installs all game files correctly for me.   DISCLAIMER: If you are 2000+ era and have never heard about the serie, you may simply don't get all the joy we got back then and better skip this title!  But if you are  really  interested in the serie, you may also check Blood I.",

I've tried everything with no luck. Even if it's few bucks, just don't waste that money and keep Blood 2: The Chosen in your memory as a great game that actually worked!",

Caleb is hilarious, the weapons are fun and the music is awesome... but no amount of polish can really make this hold up for replay in 2015. Hell... this game had its share of problems in 1998... but it was somewhat forgivable given the games cool atmosphere and the fact that games were just beginning their awkward transition into full 3d. Despite the fact that I really enjoyed this game back in the day... upon further inspection the game BARELY cut the mustard for its time... and now... uhhhhhhghhhh. This sucks :( Oh well... that will teach me to go getting all nostalgic lol. Honestly if you want a good retro FPS play the original BLOOD which still holds up just fine :)",

I've tried all the tricks and read all the forums for about three hours last night and the game still runs at 11fps on my machine. I can get 90fps in modern first person shooter games so this is definately not a hardware issue, but a hardware compatability issue. There's no technical support for this game because it's so old so I'm out of options and have to give up. Was really looking forward to playing this game because I never finished it back in the day.",
