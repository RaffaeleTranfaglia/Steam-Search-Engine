The rhythm element with the included music is often off (really badly in the last level), and the desserts (green dot(s)) only add to the score and not the 'ammo'. Custom music can be used, but you have to manually enter in the file path and beats per minute. Yeah, it's a little rough, but it's hard to have this much fun for so little money!",

That in itself would not have been a problem, but when i played it, the game was really broken and it was hard to keep up with the pace. Keep in mind that i played the game when it was first released, issues might have been patched. Still prefer the previous game though!
