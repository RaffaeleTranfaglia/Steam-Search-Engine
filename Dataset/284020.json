Its an intense game filled with every emotion in the book with appearences of characters like jaws, not the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ shark jaws, james bond jaws and you know he aint just gonna let you go without wreckin some ♥♥♥♥ first, truly a game of the ages. I would have to give this a 9/10 simply because the gameplay is in fact so intense that my heart stopped mid playthrough and when revived back at the hospital i had to break the ♥♥♥♥ out just so i could get back to the game.  extra note: i do count having to break out of the hospital as part of the gameplay since it is what im sure the developers expected to happen",

            "review_text": "I bet you didn't expect me to review this. Well I am, so here goes.  Since all of the sarcastic reviews are out of the way, here's some information that might be helpful: As of Windows 10, the game doesn't seem to execute right out of the box. Fortunately, the utility that comes with it, ScummVM, is ace at getting this stuff working and there wasn't too much hassle (just like it says in the game's description). This utility will be in Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Freddi Fish and Luthers Maze Madness\\ScummVM_Windows. Adjust the directory one level up when it asks for the path and you'll be able to configure audio and video if you had problems before. Using this utility does not seem to count in Steam for hours played, but it makes the game work and that's what counts. I'm more willing to throw that oversight onto Steam instead of Humongous, since everything they provided works as intended.  Once that's up, it plays flawlessly without lag or sound errors. Everything works as seamlessly as it did in 1997. I have no idea what the negative reviews are talking about, as you can navigate with the arrow keys just as before. You can launch your bubbles (which aren't strictly required to advance) however, as you might recall, you can only have one bubble firing at a time.  Content – The aim of the game is to collect kelp seeds while dodging enemies. Some enemies have patrol routes, others move randomly. They're not overly difficult to dodge most of the time, but you do have to use your wit to anticipate your enemy's movements. Even I got hit now and then for being careless. Points are a nice normal system that it's been a while since I've seen. Modern games tend to favour score attack where an action generates a random six-digit figure that you get desensitized to because it's beyond terms you're familiar with. Here, it's much more simplistic. Seeds are 1, shells are between 10-20 and other special items are 30-100. Every time you get 1000 points, you get a free life. Cool, got it.  Part of the strategy of the game is collect the shells and special items before you collect the last kelp seed, when the mission ends. Even if you don't, it's not a huge deal as the score is mostly to give you lives. The goal isn't to lose and submit your high score, it's to collect seeds and make it to the last level. If you lose all your lives, you can return to the last level you unlocked. Similarly, you can go back to any previous level you unlocked before and replay it at your discretion. There are 99 levels.  Soundtrack by Jeremy Soule, of all people, composer for the soundtracks of Oblivion, Skyrim, and many more, done in a nostalgic 90s style. It is, for the most part, extremely pleasant to listen to as you progress, as just about everything from him is.  There are some games that originated in the 90s and early 2000s that have popped up on Steam over the last year or so. Because I'm familiar with those from 12-17 years ago, I'm rather interested trying them to see if they can get back into action, especially when my copies stopped working long ago. Some are just looking for a easy money and are little more than broken rabble. I'm all too happy to point that out when it happens. This particular release seems to work better than the original, through ScummVM, which is able to use more of your modern system's abilities. Consequently, I'm happy to give it the credit it deserves. And I'm happy to recommend this as a modern-day kid's, because it's about adventure and solving a problem. Playing because you want to see what's out there and what's next rather than fighting, competing, and dominating everyone you meet.  This release has my recommendation, and I'm glad to see it's here.",
