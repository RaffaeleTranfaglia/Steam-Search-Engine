            "review_text": "I will preface this review by saying that Owlboy is, overall, a good game that most people will enjoy. Looking at it objectively, it is at least a solid 6 or 7 out of 10. Those who value art and are able to get into the story are likely to rate it even higher. This review, however, is here to express the viewpoint of someone who did not particularly enjoy most of the game, and to explain why it might be one to avoid for similarly minded gamers.  In a nutshell, there is one thing Owlboy does amazingly, one thing it does atrociously, and a lot of perfectly adequate game in the middle. The pixel art is second to none. The game's lengthy development cycle is evident in every single piece of scenery, every character, every cutscene, and most importantly every gorgeous animation. The artists that worked on this game deserve nothing but praise, as they have managed to achieve something truly beautiful. I have seen a number of people compare this game to Ori and the Blind Forest, and in the art department that comparison is certainly an apt one. Ori may still be the king of gaming visuals overall, but Owlboy steals the crown when it comes to pixel art.  Where Owlboy does not compare favourably to something like Ori is in the gameplay, and here comes my greatest nitpick. I say nitpick, because for many people this will likely be much less of a problem than it was for me. If you're a gamer who shares this particular niggle, however, you'll understand immediately how one seemingly small problem can all but ruin an otherwise enjoyable experience:  I am not at all exaggerating when I say that I never once played Owlboy for longer than five minutes without the game wresting control away from me. Most of the time the interruptions were far more frequent.  Whether it is for a character to deliver a line of dialogue, a cutscene to occur, a door to open, or some other scripted event to play out, Owlboy delights in dragging you out of the moment with constant jarring interruptions that destroy the pacing and flow of the experience. The vast majority of these are completely unnecessary. Even many of the lines of dialogue do not require a pause in the gameplay for them to be delivered. There are moments in the game where characters talk, doors open, and scripted sequences occur *without* taking control away from the player, and they all work perfectly.  The most egregious examples of the above are when otherwise intense boss fights are interrupted multiple times for lines of completely unnecessary dialogue to be delivered and phase transitions to occur. I cannot stress enough just how much of a toll this takes on the pacing of the gameplay. Intense moments fall flat, brain-tickling puzzles become annoying, and any section you have to repeat more than once becomes infinitely more tiresome thanks to the arbitrary interruptions. This problem permeates every aspect of Owlboy, dragging the entire experience down and souring a lot of the game's goodness. It's such a shame to see, especially after such a long development cycle, because all of it would have been completely avoidable with more awareness of how to create good pacing in gameplay.  Besides the above, most of Owlboy falls into solid 'good' territory. There are annoyances here and there, but also plenty of cool moments and clever bits of design to counterbalance them. There's no map or objective indicator, which can at times be a frustration in a metroidvania-esque game like this, but for the most part the levels are elegant and direct enough to avoid too much confusion. The bosses are very fun and satisfying when they aren't interrupted too much, and all of them are unique and memorable. The story is just fine, though nothing to write home about. There's enough emotion and drama to hit plenty of people right in the feels, but in a world where we have games like Undertale or The Walking Dead, the writing ultimately comes across as pretty middle of the road. There's passion and heart in it, however, and while the dramatic beats didn't really have enough substance for me, Owlboy at least puts far more effort into its story than the majority of games out there. The soundtrack similarly hits the correct emotional beats, but none of the tracks ever stuck in my mind for long or made me want to look them up on youtube afterwards.  Core gameplay-wise, again, it's just fine. Shooting is fun and punchy. The dash feels good. General movement is okay, but doesn't have much satisfying momentum or weight to it. You don't soar like a bird so much as just drift around the screen. There are a couple of ill-considered platforming segments that do not feel good to play at all, but they're few and far between. Some abilities and their associated controls feel responsive and well-implemented, others are a little finicky. Most of the game's puzzle gimmicks are enjoyable if a little shallow. There's really not a whole lot to talk about in this regard. Owlboy plays just fine. It does what it needs to do. Not great, not bad, just good enough and largely competent.  In regards to difficulty, Owlboy is quite forgiving without ever feeling too easy. There's just enough challenge to make beating bosses and clearing areas satisfying. Some bits will be tough for players who are less experienced with the genre, but it's by no means a hardcore game. It hits the middle of the spectrum incredibly well.  In summary, I was someone who hoped Owlboy might be a real game of the year candidate for me, in much the same way Ori and the Blind Forest was. Unfortunately, while Owlboy looks every bit the part, it doesn't quite stand up in the gameplay department. The constant interruptions were an ever-present problem, and everything else, while consistently above-average, rarely wowed me in the same way similar titles have. I made sure to finish the game so as to piece together an informed opinion on it, but at times it was something of a slog.  If you're not picky about interruptions to gameplay, Owlboy is almost certainly worth the buy. There's a lot of great stuff in there, and if you love good art then it's worth the price tag for that alone. If you're a fan of the gameplay in titles like Ori and the Blind Forest, Shovel Knight or Freedom Planet, however (and if you're keenly aware of *why* their gameplay works so well), Owlboy may be something of a disappointment.",

            "review_text": "Try to ignore the hype around how long the game took to make, it doesn't really show in any area besides the quality of the visuals. Owlboy is a decent game dressed up with really gorgeous pixel art. The gameplay lacks a strong central mechanic, the controls aren't great, the movement speed is just slow enough that traversal feels really tiresome, and I always had the feeling that the level and creature designs were never really playing to the mechanics' strengths.  Story-wise, it's an okay effort, but nowhere near what the game or some of the reviews would have you believe. I always felt like it was trying to puff up what was in actuality a pretty small package. At the first campfire sequence before you've reached the Owl Temple, Geddy talks about how it feels like they're on a real adventure. I could think of similar scenes in other games and mediums where there was a real sense of travel and reflection, but all I could think of was 'what? we're doing this now? we've only been out of the first town for less than 5 minutes'. It was a nice looking scene but it really showed the distance between what I was feeling and what the game wanted me to feel.  There were some nice character moments scattered about but, like the story, the cast is not as timeless or loveable as the game might want you to think. They're cutesy and inoffensive but they all felt a bit thin. The only moment that really grabbed me was listening to the old man from the hot spring reminiscing in the ruins. I wished the main characters impressed on me in the same way.  Ultimately, the game is okay. I'm marking it as not recommended to reflect a level of overall personal dissatisfaction, but I think the general praise implies that it resonates in some way with a lot of people. I really wish the game was as good as it wants to be.",

            "review_text": "Nine years is a large chunk of anybody’s lifetime, for those of us lucky to see a century, it’s almost a tenth of the precious, finite time we get to spend on this planet. I’ve been following the progress of this game since the first few morsels were public and admit to having forgotten about the game several times until inevitably finding more little delicious crumbs to follow until arriving at the 1st of November and a metaphorical cake, responsible for the delicious line of crumbs that preceded it waited to be eaten.   I sat there like a mad man, refreshing the store page every five seconds until I was finally allowed to pick up my fork (controller) and dig in (buy and play the game!) Until at last some wonderful music and gorgeous pixel art made way for the menu buttons, the new game started and I started to take the first bite.  After a brief and somewhat emotionally uncomfortable introduction to basic mechanics, the game proper began in a lush, warm room, I stayed here for five minutes mesmerised by the level of mastery the artist had shown through animation, colour palette and precision of pixel placement. Everything looked as it should, as the artist had no doubt spent hours meticulously on this single interior, this prospect left me feeling both excited and somewhat flabbergasted as to what might be waiting for the majority of the game that was waiting for me.  Outside, the incredible visuals began to be accompanied by some understated but catchy music, fading and acquiring new layers to its depth as the area was explored, and explore I did. I spent a good hour just playing, interacting with objects, smashing pots for the glittering coins within and hitting flowers before watching them grow back. It might be an overstatement to say that small details like this are what make good games great but what it shows is a deeper level of understanding of the symbiotic substance that is a video game. Video games are a composition of audio, visual and active interaction; the greatest challenge of any game designer or indeed, member of any games design team is to anticipate player action, it may seem stupid but by placing a seemingly small and insignificant flower for me to repeatedly lop the head off of is testament to the level of thought that has gone into building this lush, interactive world to explore.   The devil is in the details, when you move slightly a cloud of dust forms at your feet, when you flap and roll, the air visually moves behind you and it all contributes to making the movement feel dynamic. Audio, visual and interactivity composed to make even the simple act of movement fun and engaging, which is a relief because as this is primarily platforming and exploration you’re going to be doing that a lot!   Quite a few critics have, in my opinion, unfairly described OwlBoy as having a “retro pixel art aesthetic”. There is no appeal to retro-activity to be found in the sublime pixel pushing of this artist but simply a love, understanding and desire to show the gaming community the brilliance of pixel art as a form of visual art in and of itself. There were so many occasions where I sat there in sheer awe of the level of detail being presented to me in one of the harshest, most technically difficult mediums to present such things. Any person can pick the pencil tool in paint and draw an isometric cube, provided they clicked one pixel at a time this could be described as pixel art but that would be the same as getting someone to paint a portrait of their dog in oils and calling them Rembrandt.   OwlBoy is a master-class in pixel art; it is the interactive equivalent of going to see the finest works of art at La Louvre in that it showcases the medium of pixel art in a manner so far unmatched in any indie game thus far and I would put it on a level equal to some of the greatest pixel work done in video games, ever.  As mentioned earlier the visual is accompanied by some of the most whimsical, brilliantly executed musical pieces that I have heard for some time, everything is meticulous here, considered and there’s no better way to understand that to simply play it yourself. The visual and audio contribute to making each and every area feel unique, hand crafted and a pleasure to explore.  The ability to fly is such a huge and wondrous ability, usually limited to the final parts of many action-driven platformers, so it is such an ingenious twist to gimp the main characters abilities in the realm of combat very rarely can you do anything but dodge or defend when playing as Otus (the titular owlboy) alone. Luckily the designers were kind enough to supply you with three very different (mechanically and characteristically) friends to grab hold of your feet and offer their projectile shooting abilities, each has their own uses, from providing a piercing rapid fire to cover most basic enemies and weaker structures; to huge bursts of musket fire to incinerate. Not once do you feel like a character is merely there for the sake of it, they have been designed and the world and all of its dirty little secrets has been designed around both your ability to fly and their ability to help you to.   Speaking of dirty little secrets, there’s quite a few, hidden walls to find that usually contain some point of interest such as chests or coins. At one point I discovered a secret, only to return later and realise it held and even bigger one. Discovering these things always feels organic, as though you were meant to and that speaks volumes of the game as a whole to be honest, everything feels as though it was MEANT to be that way, it feels crafted, designed out of a labour of love. There will never be coins you can miss, they’ve been placed in areas that you can access after exploring an area; such is the level of foresight possessed by the creators.   The narrative, story and plot are all wonderfully executed; you’re always kept guessing and there’s enough mystery to fuel a fan base who will inevitably be making discussion threads about why certain things are said or done. The pacing feels tight and considered, not once did I feel the story was rushed or there was too much exposition thrown at me at once. Ultimately, once more, everything felt like it had a purpose, as though it belonged for a reason greater than simply “because it can”.   I’ve spent 20 hours exploring in this game and I don’t feel like single second of my time was wasted in terms of the main content of the game, there’s one mini game whose inclusion seems rather odd and out of place but this would be the singular negative in an otherwise brilliantly executed piece of art. OwlBoy rewards you for exploring, for interacting and provides some of the greatest pixel art I’ve ever seen in a game together with some top notch music.   I’d like to take this opportunity to thank the development team, thank you for spending the most precious thing you have in your life, your time, for making what has been a wonderfully fulfilling experience. You are all amazing and if I were rich enough I’d buy the game a million times over.",

If you don't feel the same way that I do, please consider that this is only my opinion, and that it's completely fine if you don't agree. It won't change my mind.   ...Where do I even begin with this game?...  Owlboy. You don't think much of a title like that right away...But then this game pulled me in.   I heard about this game from VideoGameDunkey, in his PAX video I believe. I saw the art and thought it was intriguing, as I am a big fan of art, whether it be music or visual art, or otherwise. Seeing that the game had come out recently, I bought it and started playing it. What I found was a great journey of many emotions and many wonders. I honestly felt like a child again playing this game.   Owlboy pulled me in right from the start. I was interested in the characters, their plights, and I wanted to like everybody. And honestly, I did. I can safely say I like EVERY character in this game, good or bad, for different reasons.  The art and the music is just simply breathtaking. I found myself getting lost exploring this world the whole way through. Quirky characters, funny items (play the game you'll understand), and the journey that was taken with friends. Owlboy makes you love every single friend you make in this game.   Now, this all might be fine and good, but what about THE GAMEPLAY? I can assure you, the gameplay is great. It blends so many elements of metroidvanias, zelda-esque puzzle-solving, and platforming together seamlessly into one nice ball of fun. The bosses are all exciting, encourage solving another puzzle, and keep you gripped on the story. Play this game for about thirty minutes, and you'll see what I mean.  D Pad Studios, if you guys are reading this, you spent a great 9 years making this game. I can't thank you enough. PLEASE, I IMPLORE YOU, consider porting this game to consoles, as other people should experience this wonderful masterpiece of an indie game. Any other developers that are out there playing this or considering this competition in any way, THIS IS HOW YOU DESIGN A VIDEO GAME. So many game developers today lose sight of how to design in an effort to rush a product out to grab cash quick. This game has been in development 9 years, and it's probably the best game I've ever played. No hyperbole, and no sarcasm.  In conclusion, Owlboy is a fantastic journey through a beautiful world with rich scenery, a great soundtrack, WONDERFUL characters and an absolutely wonderful story that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. My only gripe with this game, is that I wish I had more.   This game gets a 10/10 from me, and that's a hard score to come by from me these days. Thank you so much for making Owlboy, developers. All I want to do is jump back in and play the story again.",

The different characters have so much personality to them, shown in both dialouge and expressions.  While the story itself can be completed fairly quickly there's still a lot to explore and find. Spending time finding coins for the Buccanary Shop is totally worth the time spent simply for the amazing dialouges you'll get from it.

Darkness gimmick was quite tedious. Also, I expected final fight to be harder.",

Do you identify as a gamer? Maybe you've developed a game or game assets, produced fan art, competed at some level, or you have a serious hobby in video games.  If you are, the you will understand what I mean when I say that sometimes a game comes around that you need to play. A game that you will compare other games to. A game that will fill a spot in your list of accomplishments or meet a need that's been building inside of you. A game that is both nostalgic and fresh and fun.   You need to play owlboy. It's not because it's a perfect game. It isn't. Owlboy is special. It's a rare, well done, beautiful game and you will be lesser of your craft if you miss out on playing it.  Controls are very good, tight, responsive, and easy to master. I played using a controller and I recommend it. Graphics are absolutely gorgeous 2-d sprites. Sounds and music are pleasant and mood setting, they are done very well. Story is gripping. I will admit, it's not for everyone and the ending may be a tough pill for some - but overall I was entertained and glad to have seen it through (ensure you finish the sidequests to get all the details).  I rate Owlboy a 10/10. A perfect score doesn't mean a perfect game, it means that to me Owlboy represents the best of what is available right now in video games.",

Owl boy is absolutely gorgeous. I'd read reviews, watched youtube videos, etc., and was well aware going in how pretty it was supposed to be. Nothing prepared me for the first zoomed out shot of the overworld. Jaw literally dropped.   Then I started playing. Then I started waiting for it to be good. Then I started praying it would evenutally become good. It never did.   Just like the blonde cheerleader, owl boy is gorgeous and overflowing with charm, but it doesn't have a single inch of depth. 90% of the game is spamming 'roll' to get around the map and holding the left mouse button. That's it. It never advances beyond that. Even the intermittent stealth scenes are just spamming 'roll' to move from obstacle to obstacle. That's it. No strategy, no skill, no challenge. The occasional puzzle and loads of spam.   The emotional payoff of having a mute, mostly unrelatable protagonist doesn't payoff until the last scene. It's not worth 7 hours of playtime for a one minute cutscene of emotion.   I hate every word of this review because I wanted so badly to enjoy this game and be able to support the indie devs putting in the hard work to make games we crave. But, sadly, this is even more lifeless than AAA action FPS games. I would not call this adventuring, platforming, or even 'tactical twin stick' as I have seen it described.   D-Pad studio obviously has talent and knows how to make a game look good. I think they just forgot gameplay along the way. I want to say they forgot to have their game beta-tested for the 'fun-factor' before committing to it, but I doubt that's the case.",

The art is fantastic and is by far the best thing it has to offer. If good pixel art is all you need to play a game, just stop reading now and buy it.  The rest of the game is just 'solid'. The music sounds like a greatest hits collection from other games, but has no real identity of its own. The combat mechanics are fairly weak, but they take advantage of things when they can. The control scheme is just way too complicated, and the difficulty of combat comes from fighting against the controller, not the enemies on screen.  Tehnically it runs fine for me, although for some reaon it totally chugs in windowed mode to about 20 fps. It has some very minor issues with my 21:9 monitor in full screen, where overlays don't extend far enough to the edges and slight sprite pop-in is present at the edges. There is no option to change the screen resolution, which would have let me fix it myself, which is annoying but ultimately the minor graphical problems aren't game breaking.",

I have never played a game I literally forgot the next morning; they're either too good or too bad. This one was just too mediocre.  'But you only played for 47 minutes!' True! To which I defend myself by saying I went to a friend's house for the weekend and observed as he played it there, since he told me to buy it. At no point did I think 'I should buy the game again.' The gameplay is generic, the levels are generic, the story tries and fails to be meaningful, and the only redeeming quality are the graphics. It pains me that such cool graphics are in a game so utterly boring as this one.  I'm also annoyed at some reviews claiming this is the best platformer of 2016. You spend a majority of your time FLYING, which means you CAN'T PLATFORM. Child of Light had this issue. This game is not a platformer, and it barely qualifies as a puzzle game since the puzzles are laughable.  I don't want to say I didn't stay for the ending...

Between the game's heartfelt story, its absolutely stunning visuals and music, its fun Metroidvania gameplay, and its irresistable Super Nintendo-esque charm, it all combines to form one of the most memorable and satisfying adventures I've had the pleasure to play in quite some time. While it's not without its flaws, they are trivial compared to the sheer amount of polish that has gone into the final product, and ultimately, this is a game that despite having completed it, I can easily see myself returning to it time and again. Absolutely stellar game, D-Pad Studio should pat themselves on the back for this.",

Music: 9/10  Actually really really good.  Gameplay: 6/10  My two biggest issues with the game as a whole are the enemies and movement mechanics. The bosses are way too easy, I only died to the final boss once and most other bosses I did not die at all on. There are no enemies outside of bosses that were a real threat, outside of 'trap' enemies, and the static obstacle Pirates. The greatest depth in movement is tapping B every half second, or much later on (for basically a single level), using a grappling hook thing.   This game I feel would be greatly improved by adding extra abilities to the player throughout the game, and having more varied and difficult enemies, as well as making the bosses more difficult. However, this is coming from a person with 3000 hours in the Dark Souls series, so take some of that with a grain of salt.  In addition to those issues, the levels often seem very simple. All of them are entirely linear, with weak puzzles that feel more like chores than anything.  Story: 7/10 The story at times is rather generic, however at other points it is extemely engaging. Kind of a mixed bag here.  Overall: 7/10 Needs more depth, and difficulty.",

            "review_text": "After dealing with Owlboy for a full video series where I played it, it left a good impression on me as a game itself. Uncertain if I can link that, so here's just the review!  In all honesty, it's hard to rate Owlboy as anything less than 'Amazing' in almost every aspect it tries to touch upon. Gameplay is solid, the map is solid, the characters are great, the art is pretty and stylish, and the story overall is told well... But there are still flaws. In the story itself, there are a lot of things that are hamfisted or simply not explained well enough and most characters come off as negative because of that. Now, a majority of them are still fine and that's why I said they were great, but there are definitely a few I feel have fatal flaws that simply aren't explored in the gameplay. That is my major complaint.  Another major complaint is a build up that never receives a payoff. Something that may hint for things to come now that the foundation has been set, but... It could have been handled better. This game was amazing, there's no doubting that, and I'd definitely recommend it to anyone who likes action platformers like this that are very story driven. There's also a lot of hidden things that just aren't really focused on unless you really want to 100% the game, which is a plus. It's nice when a game likes to show you its story through actual work instead of just an hour long cutscene, though there are plenty of small cutscenes through this game as well.  Regardless, this game has flaws and a few major ones too, but it's not a bad game. Gameplay was simple, clean, and overall fun, but ultimately ended up becoming repetitive or just annoying, particuarlly in certain situations. The music was always on point, though, and there were only a few points where the art was an issue, particuarlly when dealing with enemies that have arkward hit boxxes or move a lot. That being said...  .. The information I have states the game took over 10 years to come out. In these 10 years, it got a lot of support and a lot of people were looking forward to it. In no way do I think anyone who did wish for it is disappointed and I am definitely not disappointed either in buying it... But it could have been better and I feel like 10 years was more than enough time to make it better. There's a lot of small things that really make this game just barely reach 'Amazing', but it's still amazing nontheless. I'm looking forward to more from this group and hopefully this game will allow them to see flaws they otherwise missed because of either lack of experience, or simply not trying to focus on fixing them. Hopefully it'll take less than 10 years next time, possibly for a sequel.   Story: 7/10 Art: 9/10 Gameplay: 8/10 Music: 10/10 Characters: 7.5/10 (One specific character has a good moment, but overall is pretty meh.) Overall: 8/10. Could use work, but it's still an amazing game that people should pick up if they enjoy this genre.",

The bad: There are maybe 10 hours of gameplay here, especially if you spin to move faster, and the game doesn't lend too much to replay value. The cannon mini-game (and to a lesser extent one boss with a related control scheme) do not have well-explained controls, unlike the rest of the game, so they come off as 'cheap' or 'overly difficult.'  The ugly: Unless I'm missing something, there is no way out of 'The Loop.' The last secret I found involves an eerie conversation about 'The Loop' with a dead owl, and that's that. Last year's big indie game had a similar 'Loop' style deep story item, but its 'True Ending' allowed the player to escape it (and even suggested not playing the game afterwards, as it would negate the premise of that ending). I'm not saying 'be more like that game,' but it's kind of sad to end with the normal ending knowing what 'The Loop' implies.  Was it worth a 9-year development cycle? That's for the developers to decide. Was it worth $30 and 10 hours of my life? If you have the disposable income, sure. If not, grab it on a Steam Sale.
