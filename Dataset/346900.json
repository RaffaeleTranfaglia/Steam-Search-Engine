            "review_text": "A popular circle jerk people have is how hard the Water Temple is to beat in The Legend of Zelda: The Ocarina of Time. The many different rooms and levels one must complete to pass the level is astounding. While although difficult to complete - The Water Temple can be beaten and the game may progress. Hyper Hippo - on the other hand - decide to make their game, Adventure Capitalist, nearly impossible to beat unless you either spend a horrendous amount of money or alternatively wait literally thousands of years (DiMono, 2015).   This game is free, mildly addicting and fun to SOME extent. You can see how you progress and can look forward to the events that come around once a month. But that's all it really is, just click around a few times a day and grind until the event comes around. After a while of waiting, the game becomes really dull.  But there is something really good about it - it's nature is true to the core. If you've never been to a casino, go to one now and look at the Pokie machines. Look at how many people waste their money away on it without any gain in return. That's what Hyper Hippo is doing to their players, latching them on and draining their wallets to a game next to impossible to complete. They're telling you that you're the ironic greedy capitalist. But, in the end, that's their job.  2/10 - I spent $0 on this game and still feel robbed.    Source ",

Larger numbers than I had ever previously known, or been able to comprehend.  So, while you're playing, you'll learn something. :P  It's free. It's worth it to at least check it out.  Play it a bit. Close it. Go about your life. Some time later, come back and check it out again, and you'll find that you have even more money, that you can use to speed things up. Earning that next upgrade, buying that next item, it's satisfying.   And there's already free expansions in development, so there's even more to look forward to.",

This game is mindless rubbish. I don't recommend it as it's just not a very good game. It really is just bars flying across the game which makes it about as mindless has some facebook games.   Yes its addictive but only for the first week. After that its a mindless game.   For those saying I haven't played it enough, I've got to the moon missions, and i did that by not playing it.

So now it's even MORE addicitive. To know how many hours you've logged and THE ACHIEVEMENTS. If new content is released for this as often as its browser version, I'll be playing this for stupid amounts of time.  There's only one real con I can give this Steam release version. It crashes rather often. After leaving it on for more than a few hours, it'll give random errors then crash, sometimes just lagging all the animations out first before doing so.",

            "review_text": "AdVenture Capitalist is one of those games that shoves a somewhat uncomfortable fact in my face. While I have played thousands of games, and love a deep story, a grand adventure, a puzzling challenge, I also love to make numbers go up. From an RPG characters stats, to the DPS numbers of my WoW raiding days, increasingly large numbers have been a benchmark of my success and progress in games.  There have been other games that offer a tongue-in-cheek or sarcastic look at the min-max or stat ♥♥♥♥♥ approach to gaming. Whether a wry look at the gaming culture such as Achievement Unlocked, or simple nods to number driven games such as Manugo in Rift, there is always a fine line between mocking the need to see numbers go up, and selling a product that, well, makes numbers go up.  I love games that are aware of that aspect of gaming, because it is important to acknowledge, and also because I want to see numbers go up. The problem with games like AdVenture Capitalist however, is that there is no deep story, no grand adventure, just numbers going up, and I still keep playing. This leads me to wonder if the numbers are really the most important part for me. If this could be the case, let us figure out why.  When I was a young lad in the previous century, there were no video games. That's right, they did not exist. Once they did, however, they took off like wildfire, and arcades began springing up everywhere. Arcades were so ubiquitous in fact, that at one point there were three of them in my bathroom. Here's the thing though. Every game back then was about one thing. Numbers going up. You could be eating ghosts in Pac-Man, blowing rocks up in Asteroids, or flipping balls at a pinball machine, the only metric you had for success in any of those things was a number, a high score. The bigger the better. If your initials were at the top of the list, you had the biggest number, and that meant you were the best.  Today though, games have become interactive entertainment that surpass anything else for truly immersive journeys through fantastic worlds. Amazing stories are told, and you can be the focal point of legends, with songs sung in 5.1 surround sound about your heroic deeds, and displayed in glorious 1080p. I love those games as well, but I still have roots in the old-school patterns and numbers that video games started with. So why AdVenture Capitalist? Making numbers go up is how I learned gaming. It's what we started with, its what I know. What's your excuse? ",

The more managers you buy they work for you even offline to make money but the game wants you to eventually take a breather.. *whispers* I don't want to stop. Follow the mob and hop on the bandwagon!  Brief Breakdown I feel accomplished in this game, you start off spam clicking lemons and buying more in order to sell. Then you want to hire a manager to do the clicking for you! Keep in mind there is a meter below each icon, once filled the earnings DOUBLE each time.   [Upgrades &amp; Angel Investors] You can buy upgrades to make 3x profits or attract 'angel investors' by earning more money and resetting your business!   [Meters] The meters on show you how much time until you can make the next purchase and it will eventually show numbers because you have upgraded your business enough that it requires more time for the next available upgrade in order to purchase again.  Note this is all that I have gathered after playing only 10mins of this game and will update this review once I have calmed down and slept. As I progress the review will be updated with the new information I have gathered. Thanks for reading :) ",

            "review_text": "[8/3/2016]  So they finally listened to people telling them, over, and over. That Earth was unwinnable and finally made the end game a bit more fair. now... does this change my stance on the game? not really? The game still sucked away almost over a year of my life with really nothing to show for it and had massively pointless waste of time endgame that while now fixed doesn't erase what it did to people.  In the end these clickers are hallow games that can slowly erode your like of video games, and faith in the good will of others.  and lastly overall, do not goto the forums. good god, just don't do it.    [update]  Crunching the numbers further me along with several other people have realized Earth is realistically unfinishable, even if one were to cash its literal years to reach the end. so I post this as another warning to people looking to complete the game, you wont get what you want.  [update]  They recently added content to Earth that really does nothing else but push the 100% achievements goal post out further for people, how much further? its estimated if you don't spend cash at all: several months to a year. The new 'content' isn't really content at all either, just pushes the goal post back if you wanted to just get 100% and wrap up the game. So now I feel the fool for ever playing this, The only winning move is to never play.   [Original Review]  There was a time that I'd have recommended this game, it was a harmless clicker game that just required the occasional input...  Then came the moon.  The moon is designed in such a way that progress is so aggravatingly slow that they are trying to tempt people to spend cash (most specifically on the moon exclusive cash item: the flux capacitor) This is also a game that doesn't allow the player to, even in the smallest of amounts, earn the cash currency. It is clear that at the time of writing this review there are more space locations planned and I expect them to have some gimmick that tries to sell cash too.  The game is free so I guess if you wanna play go ahead, those that would be easily swayed by the pace to wanna spend cash though I'd recommend staying away.",

It's a nice way to pass time, where you build up your own empire starting with lemonade stands and newspapers. You can hire managers to do the dirty /boring click grinding/ work so you passively earn money, even when you're not actually in-game. It's a nice feature which makes it easier to come back to as you don't have to constantly keep it open to get something done.  There is no end to the game, you can keep on selling and then rebuilding your capitalist empire as many times as you'd like, where you are rewarded with investors, which makes the game even easier and more fast paced.  Moral of the story; Don't try the game if you're easily bored, this is an endless grind. Playing it for hours on end might also make you a bit tired of the game, but I really like it so far. It has some funny references and jokes etc. and you can unlock SWAG so what do you have to lose on trying it?  TL;DR: It's like another version of Cookie Clicker, just with Steam achievements.",

The time required to get all unlocks/achievements has pretty much been increased exponentially.

The update also makes you have to pay for the Quick Buy Upgrades button, ♥♥♥♥s up the user interface so that you need to play in widescreen resolution to see text fully, and other funky bullcrap.  As for fun new bugs, sometimes my I can also quickbuy upgrades I already have or my newspapers suddenly stop making money and require another click to start up again. Yay progress!  ------------------  You know what's funky? Cookie Clicker.  You know what's disgusting? Cookie Clicker with p2w microtransactions.

            "review_text": "Here is one of the first Idle games I stumbled upon (same time as Clicker Heroes) and while I enjoyed the first 20 to 30 minutes it soon dropped off my gaming list as I found Clicker Heroes much superior when it came to 'gameplay'. After a few weeks my motivation flared again tho once I unlocked certain things and gameplay sped up a bit. As of now I consider myself in late midgame (7000 lemon stands) and everything has slowed to a crawl. The moon which was supposed to renew my interest into the game has only helped to crush my motivation due to its slow pogression.  I put in enough hours in this free to play game to say its well worth your time IF you like this kind of games. Overall placing it in the genre I d give it a 6/10.  So...lets go into details.  This game is about DECISIONS, you wont 'play' this as you do other games of yours.   You start out with only a couple dollars and invest them into companies which can be as small as lemon stands and as big as oil companies. Each company has a 'run-time' and will yield you some cash after its done. Lemon stands provide a low income but also have a low run-time so you spend some time clicking the bar in order to initate a run-time while you earn more cash which you invest into companies again. You can either buy more companies of a type you already own (increasing the efficiency of income) or invest into new ones.  The heart of the game are actually the sidebars giving you new windows with different types of options. You can recruit managers which will at first 'click' the bar for you opening up more time for you to do whatever you want with (checking statistics, thinking about your strategy, play another game). Later managers reduce purchase prizes of their comany type and so on.  Another bar provides access to general bonuses which you can purchase with either money or angels (more to this later). These can be things like doubling overall income or improve a specific company type.  Bonuses lists all milestones which will grant you huge bonuses so its something like a 'roadmap' for you to work towards.  The universal fact about AdVenture Capitalist is that everything becomes obscenly expensive very soon forcing you to wait for upgrades while youe income accumulates until you can spend it again. Progression soon will become rather slow. The game continues running even if you are offline as it simply simulates the time gone by and adds the according income onto your tab. What it doesnt do for you is spend your money or invest into upgrades. Thats the 'decision' part I mentioned earlier.  The 'solution' if you will is not to let the game run but to direct the flow of money you earn in order to progress in an optimal way. You will always progress, there is no way to 'lose' the game or end up in a dead end but how quickly you do / how much time you spend until you hit another milestone depends on the decisions you make.  So there is a routine which becomes appearant quickly. A 2-side coin of spending money and waiting for it to generate until you can spend it again. We are not talking about mere millions here (even tho on your first run that can take a while as well) but SEPTSEXAGINTILLIONS.....dont ask me how many zeroes that are lol. Its safe to say that you ll soon move in a range of money that doesnt even exist in the whole world.  So we come to the core of the game. Percentages. How do you actually invest your money the 'best possible way'. Thats the actual challenge packed into a game. But the mechanics behind it can be found in everyday companies because its the wheels that turn the world. I guess any banker will have an immediate advantage at this thing :)  Instead of 'waiting' for years of real time until you generate enough cash (thats how long it would actually take) the game implements several factors in order to speed up the process. These are the milestones, bonuses and angels.    Milestone  can be checked under bonuses and show you what happens when you reach a certain number of a specific company. Hit 100 lemon stands and your income doubles or triples or your run-time reduces. Instead of going as high as possible you rather invest enough to unlock a milestone then focus on others in order to enhance your overall gameplay. Some milestones even affect all companies so checking constantly how far away you are from a milestone is well worth it.  You could invest 100 million dollars into car wash companies which would result in a hefty profit NOW but if you wait until you hit 110 millions and put them into lemon stands (resulting in much less profit if you break it down to a profit-per-dollar base) instead you ll reach a milestone making ALL your companies 2 times as profitable.  How you do the above example doesnt matter as you will reach it anyway but how LONG you ll spend of your time to reach it does difer.   Bonuses  start out low and slow but soon become the driving force of your game. These percentages do add up over time. Everybody who paid for a house and tried to pay the bank while doing so knows what I m talking about /grin. Theres a big list of bonuses to unlock so you ll be busy for a while trying to get them all.   Angels  These holy creatures are attracted by wealth and will accumulate over time. They dont do anything at first rather then watching you but you can always 'claim' your Angels which will in effect soft-reset your game erasing all your money and deleting your companies. While before they were watching they are now 'comitted' meaning they affect your work (the genre calls this 'banked') throughout these soft resets. Each angel banked will increase your profit by 2%. Lets say you managed to accumulate 150 on your first runthrough that means that your NEXT run (even tho its the same in terms of gameplay) will be 3 times as fast.  Instead of making your game faster Angels ensure that you make more money in less time. So if your first million on your first playthrough took you roughly 10 minutes later on you ll generate this much with a single lemon stand on your first click because you have several BILLION Angels banked.    What follows is a combination of factors all playing together rising your income to really obscene levels. The routine is to go through the works in order to generate Angels.....soft-reset and reach your previously achieved money in LESS time. Your income rate increases this way but also do the prices of companies. Again decisions come into play. You could wait an hour for enough cash to generate in order to buy that next lemon stand or you could claim your angels NOW and be past this point in another hour.  Let me assure you, you will soft-reset many many times. Its actually the core mechanic in the game.   Once you become rich enough you ll have the option to go to the moon where the whole game starts again just with different factors and different mechanics (if you try to play the moon as you do the earth you ll fail hard = taking so long you ll lose any fun)    So lets come to the conclusion of this game.....whats actually fun about it or makes it worth playing?     This game is all about progression (like any other idle game as well). Not everybody will like it of course. The fact that you can start it, let it run in the background and only occasionally check back in order to spend your income makes it perfect for a wide range of people tho. You have to make a mental leap from raising levels and getting gear to this sort of money making but at its core....its the same. Optimization and progression.",

It's far diffrent from Cookie Clicker but takes some aspects such as the reset system gaining Investors.  It's a very good idling game if you're into any type of incremental game such as the widley known Cookie Clicker. Yuo can spend a very good amount of hours playing this game, just tabbing back in to see what you can buy and what not.  The reason I like theses types of games is because of the feeling of coming back to them and seeing how much I've gained. Now the diffrence from this game to other incremental games is that it keeps going even after you've closed the game. I like to keep it open just cause and to show to my friends that I keep this game open for that long.  I'd recommend this game because you can just open it and go to work, or go to the park, or even just leave your computer for a few hours and then come back to loads of money sitting in your pocket waiting for you to spend.",

            "review_text": " AdVenture Capitalist  by  Hyper Hippo Productions Ltd  is a fantastic little game in which you play as a young investor trying to get as much wealth and riches as possible via investing in different markets/businesses.    Gameplay:   AdVenture Capitalist's gameplay thrives on it's simplicity and effectively works as an investment simulator. You invest in a certain market, exit the game, wait a few hours and then come back to loads of money. This cycle repeats again and again... and again. This means you only have to play several minutes a day because your hard-earned cash will continue to pile up even when the game is closed. This makes the actual 'playing' of the game short and sweet. As your cash pile grows you'll be able to purchase more and more upgrades to improve your income. This abundance of available upgrades will extend your game time significantly if you have a desire to get all of them. On top of this there is a reset/prestige-esque system in place which will allow you to start from square-one once again and get special, unique upgrades in the next playthrough.    Visuals:   AdVenture Capitalist visual style shines when compared to similar games. Its unique and 'cartoony' aesthetic really compliments the theme and audio of the game. Its also nice and easy on the eyes.    Audio:   The soundtrack to AdVenture Capitalist is a fun little jingle which really pairs well with both the art style and 'comedic investor' vibe. It can also be very closely related to that of Muzak. (typical commercial music e.g. elevator music) Although it may not have much depth to it, and be very repetitive, it is not an issue due to the fact it will only be heard for several minutes each play session.    Optimization, Settings and Bugs:   These features aren't that important when it comes to AdVenture Capitalist due to the nature of its gameplay. However, they exist nonetheless. The options are not accessible while the game is running, they must be configured on launch. This isn't a problem due to the fact you will barely ever, if not never, be changing the settings.  The available settings include: Resolution, Windowed/Fullscreen, Quality, Display Unit/Output and Key Bindings. The wide variety of resolutions make it so that  almost  anyone can play in their native resolution, they can also easily choose which monitor to display the game on. As for the Quality options, there is a small array of different choices, but I haven't found these to have any major effects whatsoever. There seems to be a random selection of completely unnecessary and irrelevant key binds, however, they don't impact the game whatsoever.    Business model:   There is a premium currency, Gold, which can purchase you several boosts and a shiny, cosmetic Golden Suit. The boosts will significantly increase the speed at which you obtain things, however, everything is obtainable without them. It can't really be considered 'pay-to-win' due to the fact there isn't really a win/beat the game and also the fact it is a single player game. As for the gold suit, it does nothing but except makes you look the part and show off your wealth.  Overall, AdVenture Capitalist is definitely worth a play no matter how long (or short) you play it for. It is a casual, easy-going game with no major flaws. It has also rightfully earned the title of FREE-to-play.  ",

            "review_text": "AdVenture Capitalist is an odd game. It's extremely addicting and doesn't let you go after it gets a hold on you, but addicting isn't the same thing as 'fun'.   Gameplay: At its' core, AdVenture Capitalist is a game about watching numbers go up, and buying upgrades to make those numbers go up more quickly. Unfortunately, this game has nothing else to it. Other idle games, such as Clicker Heroes and Cookie Clicker, have things you can do in the game to manually speed up the number temporarily or grant the player more money, in the form of hidden objects and, well, clicking. AdVenture Capitalist has no way to manually speed up the number, There are no hidden objects that appear randomly, there is no clicking function, and this drains all the fun out of it. There is literally nothing to do in this game except for buy things and wait. With nothing to do inbetween buying those things, the player has no reason to keep playing the game, and will most likely close it in favour of something else, as the number goes up even when the player is offline. This is just bad game design.  2/10, and that's only because it somehow manages to be addicting to check every once in a while.  Music: With only 2 songs throughout the entire game, one being a remix of the first, there is little variety and the music gets very annoying, very quickly. The second track, which is for the moon, is more tolerable than the first, but it's still nothing special. 4/10 because of the prescence of the moons' music and a mute button for earths'.  Graphics: While it may be lacking in the other departments, AdVenture Capitalist's visual aspect is actually very well-done. The art style is interesting and cartoony and the small animations here and there are nice touches to give the game some life. While it is not the best-looking game out there, it does look visually appealing enough for even players who care mostly for graphics to consider playing. 7/10. The game looks good, nothing extraordinary.  To be honest, that's all there is to this game. There's buying things, watching a number, below-average music, and admittedly good-looking visuals. Some other small things that I like/dislike about the game worth noting include:  + The humour. The managers and names of the upgrades have some clever references. +0.3 total score + The fact that the businesses function differently on the moon versus on earth. It would have been easy to copy/paste but a whole new system was added instead. +0.2 total score + The game tells you how much money you made while you were offline and how long you were offline for. This is extremely helpful in noting how much money you make per hour or day. +0.1 total score + It's free-to-play. +0.1 total score  - The Microtransactions. Not a huge deal, but waiting almost a week to unlock the moon after buying it because I didn't have enough money was kind of aggravating. -0.1 total score - In my opinion, the game is much too long considering what you're actually able to do in it. This is a huge problem for me because as it stands currently, I'm more than 50 hours in on my first file and am nowhere near done. -0.3 total score  FINAL SCORE: 4.6/10 I really liked this game at first, but it eventually got old and I realised that I had spent 50+ hours staring at a screen, most of that time doing absolutely nothing. Don't play this game unless you're ready to lose hours of your life to something you most likely won't enjoy.",

Now that it is over, I feel compelled to break my silence and protect the innocent from this monster.  It ended as it began, not with a bang but a whimper- a little spray of angels and not even a word of congratulations.  I have steadily come to the conclusion that it is a soul-sucking beast, lurking to drain the time from unsuspecting boys and girls. This stolen time it uses to power the corrupt life force to tempt in more of the unsuspecting in an ever repeating and expanding cycle.

Once you get the managers, you can either close the game or keep it up while playing other games and still gain money. What is better about this version when compared to the IPhone is the achievements. They really give you a reason to waste your time rather than simply looking at a screen and clicking, waiting some time, and repeating. Overall, this game does its purpose very well. It exists to fill time when waiting for something else.",

The devil's in the details. This game is very dynamic and addictive. There's no other mechanism behind it. You soon find yourself staring at the screen and waiting for the bar to finish, cause you want to buy more, more, MORE!  It works just like a regular business. At the beginning it needs your attention all the time. Later on, you can turn off the game and return after a few hours just to monitor your business situation. This is what I particularly like very much about the game.  And let's now forget for a moment that the game is free. If you're looking for a 'serious' business game, this one is not. It lacks mechanics so much. It's simplified to the limits. There's no goal, no efficient way of doing things, no changes in economic index like demand. Of course, you still can try and play it rationally but the game just won't assess your work. What's more, it'll still demand from you some useless actions (like buying another 1000 lemon stand when you've already had 100 refineries and you don't need those $100 income) just in order to get an achievement.  Anyway, I'd definitely recommend. It's fun. Simple, but fun.",

            "review_text": "When I was younger, I recall my friends taking their bikes out after school and riding to the local convenience store to buy candy and other life non-essentials. I was always fickle. I didn't like candy, but I loved lemonade. My friends would make fun of me, but when they would head off to have fun after school, I would set up my cardboard lemonade stand in front of my neighborhood and peddle my colored sugar water to what I once considered 'well-established' families in minivans coming from at the end of the day.  It wasn't long before I hired a helping hand to manage a second lemonade stand down at the convenience store my friends would frequent. For kids, we were really raking in the dough. On my days off, I would treat my friends to candy at the store and they quickly realized how lucrative my lemonade stands were and I convinced them to run a stand for me, for a percentage of my profits.  Years later, I'd built a conglomerate. In addition to owning the most popular lemonade company in the world, with thousands of locations worldwide, I'd built a monopoly on the newspaper delivery industry (somehow still not replaced by digital content), car washes, pizza parlors and donut shops. I started to become overwhelmed with the amount of money pouring in and decided I needed a way to clear my mind, so I bought my first boat. It was a nice, quaint little yacht called 'Streets of Monaco'. I was sun bathing on the deck when it hit me - I was wasting my time with land based ventures. I needed to expand. I looked longingly out to sea and pondered only for a moment before telling my personal assistant to set up a deal - I wanted to buy a thousand shrimp trawlers.  Before I could blink, I now had control of the seas. Currently, my fleet's output accounts for 92% of the global catch. One day, researchers aboard one of my vessels over the Mariana Trench discovered a new species of shrimp and accredited me with the discovery for allowing them to accompany my ships out to sea free of charge. They honored me by naming the shrimp after me, and let me tell you, that was one tasty shrimp. Publicity from the discovery led to, though unnecessary, donations pouring in from global donors and research organizations.  Although I could afford everything a man could desire out-of-pocket at this point in my career, I took the money anyway because I'm a business man and I never pass up free money. I decided to put it to good us, however personal the reasons, and became a deep-sea innovator and pioneer, leading a team of myself (because I deserve all the credit) to the bottom of the sea. 'Where,' you ask? Well, to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, of course. It was there that I discovered hundreds of new species, a few of which held the cures for cancer, the common cold and stupidity. There was one fish, a very special fish, which I kept as a companion. In an instant, I became the most sensational man on the planet. I was on fire and quickly became bored once again. How was a man who single-handedly spearheaded exploration to the lowest point on Earth to be amused by Earthly trinkets and games any longer?  After paying off the U.S. debt and moving into the White House, it dawned on me that I was not a man who could be contained by governmental borders. Although I could easily buy my way anywhere, anytime, I decided I shouldn't have to - and bought the entire world. Why? Because I could. I was making money hand-over-fist. Faster than I could ever dream of spending it. I decided to expand my ventures, once again, and decided to make my first PR move. I bought every Hockey team. Period. Then I began to produce digital content. Movies, television shows, podcasts, you name it...  My name had become a common household name like Kleenex or Scotch tape. It was this familiarity and trust that led me to open my own bank. Logically, everyone immediately wanted to keep their money with me. As I was making so much money, there was no risk of ever going bankrupt. It wasn't long before I possessed 99.8% of all the money in the world. Now, then, what was a man to do? A man who literally owns the world. It was time for a new venture.  Similar to my previous desire to break the bonds of mortal divides, I soon yearned to be free of them altogether. I reluctantly partnered with former PayPal entrepreneur and Tesla Motors CEO Elon Musk, taking advantage of the trivial work and progress he had already done in space 'exploration'. Anything can be solved if you throw enough money at it. When it came time to depart on the company’s Maiden voyage, I became ill. The idea of space travel didn't turn my stomach, rather, it was Elon's musk. I had been forced to endure the odor long enough and, though I’m now ashamed to admit it, I sent him on a suicide mission. It wasn't long after his accident that I was able to successfully fix the “reliability issue” and become the first civilian to self-fund a trip to the moon, if that word could even be used to define my status anymore.  Upon my arrival in the terrestrial world, I immediately saw a market for new opportunities. It wasn’t long after constructing my moon base that things started to become dull and boring. Perhaps it was the loneliness, but one night while staring up at the blue marble, wondering how the poor souls on Earth were doing, I decided that in order to truly leave that life behind, I must also dispose of my Earthly companion. As there had only ever been one of my very special companion ever found, I didn’t want to simply set it free to have it die an ungraceful, lonely end, rather, I opted to eat my friend. It wasn’t until after I had taken the first bite that, much to my surprise, I realized this was no rare fish…  This was an angel .  I was indifferent at first. I had never been very religious, personally. Although I didn’t finish my meal (it really didn’t taste that good), I did feel different. And I liked it. Something within me had changed. Suddenly, I was surrounded by more and more of these rare creatures and for some reason, they were attracted to me. By consuming angel, had I become some sort of angel magnet? To this day, I’m still not sure, but it was amazing. Year after year my revenues, though steadily flowing in, were climbing slower and slower. It seemed as if there was some sort of glass ceiling. Despite profits increasing at first, after a while though, the same thing happened. My growth seemed to slow once again. Becoming bored, I was lost in the recesses of space, my mind… Wondering where my next boost would come from. Then it was right in front of me. Like a light bulb turning on, I thought to myself “If by killing one of these angels my revenues were bolstered, then perhaps by killing another it will happen again…”  500 quattuorvigintillion angels later, I began to feel more like a battle-hardened, steel cold warrior instead of a motivated businessman. Remorselessly, day in and day out I slaughtered countless angels. The depths of my pockets became unfathomable, though I lost more and more of myself. The profits were a drug. I couldn’t stop. That is, until one day, I was faced by an angel whose face I recognized. It was my late wife. It was at that moment that I had realized what I had done (besides become the wealthiest, most important man in the universe). I had lost myself. That little boy with the lemonade stand, just trying to make enough money to buy some candy… For friends. Friends, I longer had any. Family... I never had children.  I remember… At first, having money was great. I was on top of the world. It was great, but I lost myself. Who I really am. Then the depression set in... Now I find myself back at home, on Earth, just being me. I live with my mother. My 5 o’clock shadow grows darker each day, my wife beater more stained. Stained with tears, sorrow. Sorrow, but not remorse. Now I just play AdVenture Capitalist, sorrowful that I can’t sacrifice angels faster.",

You get currency, upgrade, and then reset to get more upgrades to get more currency faster, rinse, repeat. What I like about this game, however, are all of the little nods and references to our capitalist society. It is humourous.  The 'event' planets are fun. The most recent one before this post, the 2016 Capitalist Christmas Card event, was fun itself, and all of the references to popular Christmas movies were great. There are also similar references on the 'main' planets. The Futurama references on Mars are my favourite.   I've tried the game on several platforms. While on all of the mobile platforms, it is much faster, I actually like not having ads intruding on the gameplay. Yes, according to the mobile versions, 'Advertising is the lifeblood of capitalism!' However, I think I prefer the slower pace. I think that the slowness is why people gave the game poor reviews. The problem is the no double boost for running an ad, which you cannot do through Steam.   All in all, though, not a bad game.  ",

The 3X profit multiplier is a microtransaction. That means you can't spend money on this game fast enough to beat it before you die.  The devs acknowledged the fact that the game game is unbeatable roughly a month ago(at the time of writing this) and they have done/said nothing else on the matter. Oh but recently they did let us know that they now have AdCap merch you can buy. My review will stay up until they make this game beatable.

            "review_text": "I’ve been playing it for getting on for six hours now. I say playing, but what I mean is ‘watch numbers roll in and occasionally press a button when one lights up’. This is a game which solely concerns itself with the acquisition of money, which is then spent on buying things which mean more money. Speculate to accumulate and all that. An infinite snowball effect – buy a small industry, spend its profits on a larger industry, and then a larger one, and onwards and upwards until what began as a handful of dollars trickling in every second becomes billions.  All you have to do is click a button to buy/found/invest in/not sure but it doesn’t matter I guess a new company as and when you have the cash. So initially you’ve got just one lemonade stand, but its profits get spent on buying another one. Make it to 25 and the speed of its profits double. Same again and 50, 100 and 200 (and beyond, but I’m not there yet). Or you can wait a while longer and unlock a whole new industry – newspapers, pizza delivery, donut restaurants, all the way up to banks and oil companies. Each ‘new’ industry brings in vastly more sums of money, but at a slower rate, at least until you upgrade it. So you sit there waiting for these little money timers to reach their end, then you click again, repeat and repeat and repeat, spending everything you earn on making everything you own earn more.  With enough cash, you can hire managers to do the cash collection click for you. At that point, AdVenture Capitalist is supposed to become an idle game. It runs in the background, making lots and lots and lots of oh my God sickening amounts of money, and every so often you dip back in and unlock something more, in order that the next time you go back in you’re earning orders of magnitude more cash all over again. You can even exit the game and when you load it back up it’ll have calculated what you’ve earned since the last time it was open. It’s Fable III without the fighting, basically.  But I didn’t do that. I didn’t exit. I barely even alt-tabbed. I just sat there, watching, waiting, hungry for a button to turn orange so I could buy more of something. I was ravenous for more cash; cash which only had a function within this accursed game. Every line I write in this post, I flick out to see if I can buy anything else. And then I end up staring at these green rows, all refilling at varying speeds.  The lemonade stands on top left move like lightning, earning $762 a second, while the oil company at lower right will give me $89 billion every 10 hours. By tomorrow morning I can have upgraded the oil co enough that it’ll be making me something like $200 billion every five hours. By tomorrow night, I might see my first trillion. A few of them and I can triple profits across the board.  At some point, I’ll sell all my shares and start over, this time with a horde of angel investors impressed by my monstrous ability to make monstrous profits, their input meaning I’ll make money even faster, even bigger profits this time around. And it will go on and on and on and on and on and maybe that would be OK if only I could stop watching. If only I could tell myself I didn’t have to be there, watching, the second another button lit up, that it doesn’t matter if I don’t buy an upgrade as soon as I can afford it, that the world will not stop turning because I’m not at maximum revenue efficiency every second of every minute of every hour of every day.  It’s just numbers getting bigger. It’s the cynical serpent curled aroundthe heart of every social game, every action RPG, every MMO, every gambling machine, but at least it makes no pretence that it’s about anything more than that. There’s this thin veneer of Monopoylisms with a touch of sardonic Fallout nonchalance and lazy references to famous figures, but it’s just set-dressing and it knows it. This is an experiment in how venal we can be.  I know that, even by the standards of videogames, nothing I do in it has any meaning, that I could never begin to justify the time I spent with this. In my only defence, at least I’ve resisted the entirely optional in-app purchases which would make everything happen faster still. It feels like cheating, but I know that even so all I’m doing with this game is cheating myself of time and life.  Yet in an hour I can upgrade my Bank to 25, which will double the speed it cashes out, and that’ll mean something like $60 billion every half an hour. It would be wasteful for that bank to spend even a minute performing beneath this amazing potential.  A lifetime ago, I was making $2 every few seconds from lemonade sales. What a nobody I was.",

It’s a casual clicker game with a pretty nice aesthetic and catchy music. You start off with nothing but a simple lemonade stand and turn it into a financial empire the likes of which no one has ever seen.  I liked how this game both looked and played, it was pretty intuitive. It didn’t bring much that’s new to the table but it was enjoyable none the less. I liked acquiring the angel investors whom added to the speed in which you make money and were very much needed to get the super massive numbers you need. Also the ability to start up 2 new in game empires on the moon and mars was nice, and really added to the diversity of the game.   This game will take you a long time to complete and is very addictive once it sinks its teeth into you. Plus as it’s free to play with optional in game purchases that you don’t need to get to have fun then there is no excuse not to have a go.  Plus, and this sounds silly, this game actually taught me about super massive numbers and that was something I found enjoyable.  Have Fun ^_^",

            "review_text": "First off, let's get one thing clear. This is NOT a game. What it is, is something from the depths of hell, spawned by Satan himself to punish Donald Trump for being a stupid and greedy redneck. Somehow Donald Trump managed to turn the tables on Satan and find a way to get even more rich by dumping this most unholy 'thing' on unsuspecting Steam users. I'm not sure Satan minds too much though since now he gets to torture millions of innocent souls daily without lifting a finger. Damn you Donald Trump, damn you!  But you don't really care so let me just tell you what this is all about. It's really not a game but more of a fun little diversion while you wait for something better to do. All you literally do in this game is click a few buttons and then come back tomorrow and do the same. Over and over again.  The premise is very simple. You're given enough money to buy a single lemonade stand. You then click on the lemonade stand to earn some more money. Every time you click on a 'industry' button it generates money. The lemonade stand doesn't generate too much at first but it's instant cash. So you click a few times until you can afford another lemonade stand and then another and you keep clicking to get more money. Eventually you have enough money to buy a manager who takes over the clicking and you then just sit and wait for the cash to roll in.  Once you have enough money you buy a car wash. Then a doughnut shop. You keep doing this until you have all the businesses, ending with the oil rig. Each business initially takes longer and longer to earn money but generate higher amounts of cash. Once you buy a set amount of each the times get shorter and shorter until everything is almost instant.  To get to that point though you'll need angels. Lots and lots of angels. And upgrades. As you get more and more money you attract angels which you can then claim by resetting the game and starting from scratch again or by paying the developer some real money to allow you to claim said angels without resetting. The game has a few micro transactions like this but you really don't need to spend any money to progress. You basically just pay to speed up your progression. Since the game is free I don't have a problem with this concept.  Is it fun? Initially yes. It's hard to explain but you'll find yourself coming back to claim your new angels, restart, get everything as far maxed out as you can and then come back tomorrow to do it again. there's no strategy or skill involved. It's just a clicker with a rather unique hook to keep you coming back.  Eventually you'll get quite bored of I suspect. Once you reach a certain point the progress really slows to a crawl and that is perhaps my one and only gripe with this game. It's entertaining at first but after you reach the crawling stage you'll wish there was some incentive for bothering to keep at it. Or some mechanic to make it worth while. It becomes quite apparent that the progress has been setup with the aim of generating micro transactions and unless you pay up you're not going to 'beat' the game anytime soon or have fun doing so. AT which point you don't bother anymore.  That being said, for what it is, it is an entertaining time waster for those moments between downloads, waiting for a new game or wasting your lunch hour at work on. And it's free so trying it out won't hurt. Just don't expect a game in any real sense of the word. This is a click and wait gimmick that is looks like it would be quite at home on Facebook or an iPhone.",

There's no point in playing this game for long periods of time. This is not news with 'cookie clicker' type acquisition/funds games. The issue is that this game does it *very* early on and repeatedly does it over and over. This doesn't make the game harder, it just makes whatever the goal is supposed to be take way longer than it needs to.  Your final destination is something like 4000-4500 of a nonspecific business on Earth. After that, you bury the coffin. Moon is impossibly slow as well. Mars is coming supposedly, but it won't be fun if it's even worse. Exchanging is pointless, the special currency is for P2W only. Terrible, awful game just like every other of its kind. I also think it uses cryptomining software embedded inside it.  ",

Yes there are those few moments of feeling like you have accomplished something but actually I'ts pure illusion really.

Another nice thing about this game is it feels more like an earlier version of Cookie Clicker. The current version of Cookie Clicker keeps forcing holidays on you and charges you to change from Christmas to Halloween to Valentine's Day, etc.  I don't agree with the use of micro transactions, but this game doesn't really require you to use it, unlike most games that use the micro transaction system.

            "review_text": "Were you expecting a review? Well, I don't have one, but what I DO have is part of the transcript for M. Night Shamalamalamalams 'The Last Airbender'.  The film begins with metal letters reading 'The Last Airbender'. As they fade away, a silhouetted figure appears, who bends a blob of water from the bottom of the screen. Cut to another figure, who lifts a piece of earth out of the ground and kicks it away. Cut to a third figure, who manipulates a stream of fire with his hands and blasts it at camera. Cut to the final figure, who twirls around and blasts air at the camera. Cut to a text crawl, which is narrated by Katara. Katara [Narrating.] A hundred years ago, all was right with our world. Prosperity and peace filled our days. The Four Nations: water, earth, fire and Air Nomads lived amongst each other in harmony. Great respect was afforded to all those who could bend their natural element. The Avatar was the only person born amongst all the nations who could master all four elements. He was the only one who could communicate with the Spirit World. With the Spirits' guidance, the Avatar kept balance in the world. [Continues with single text on screen.] And then, a hundred years ago, he just disappeared. Act I, The Boy in the Iceberg A screen of text appears, reading Book One: Water with the waterbending symbol below. It fades to a scene of water swishing gently back and forth. The camera pans to reveal Katara practicing her forms on the edge of the ice. She eventually levitates a small sphere of water out of the ocean and plays with it gently before accidentally tripping and sending it flying down off-screen. Sokka leaps up from off-screen, soaked from the impact. Katara I'm sorry. I'm sorry! Hey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry ... Katara I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Hey! It worked better that time. Katara I thought about Mom. Isn't that strange? Sokka Yeah. I guess so. Just stop doing that stuff around me. I always get wet. Katara accompanies Sokka on a hunt for food for their tribe. Katara [Narrating.] My brother and I live in the Southern Water Tribe, which was once a big city. Our father is off fighting in The War. My mother was taken prisoner and killed when I was young. In this time of war, food is scarce. My brother and I often go hunting for food, but, unfortunately, my brother isn't the best hunter in the world. Sokka follows the tiger seal tracks, leading them out to the vast open field of ice Sokka Tiger seal. Katara Are you sure? Sokka I did everything Dad said to do. I watched which side of the fin tracks are more indented. That shows which direction they're going. I saw how long the drag skids are. That shows you how fast they're going. Katara There's something under there. Sokka uses his boomerang to crack the floor open but the cracks expand and start a cave-in. Sokka It's a cave-in! Move away from the cracks. A large ice sphere emerges from the cracks with a silhouette of a person inside it. Sokka Katara, don't go near it. This is probably some Fire Nation trick. Just back away really slow. As Sokka turns around, Katara grabs his boomerang and uses it to crack the sphere. Sokka Katara! Do not hit that sphere! The ice sphere breaks part, shooting a bright light high to the sky, which catches the attention of Prince Zuko on a faraway ship Zuko Uncle, look! In the resulting ice crater, Katara and Sokka slide down to discover a thirteen-year-old boy, Aang, alive but exhausted, with his large six-legged bison creature, Appa. Katara Is he breathing? Sokka Did you see that light shoot into the sky? Katara What's your name? How did you get here? How did you get in the ice? [The boy turns toward Katara but is too tired to speak.] He's exhausted. [To Sokka.] We need to get him back to the village. Sokka [Pokes around Appa, who is still sleeping.] What is this thing? [Appa's tail accidentally lands on top of Sokka.] It's trying to eat me! Aang is taken back to the village where he soon recovered in an igloo. Appa follows them home off-screen, much to the amazement of the villagers Villager Look. See? Katara enters the igloo where the boy was recovering. As he puts on his shirt, Katara sees the tattoos on his back Katara How'd you get all the way out here? Aang I ran away from home. We got in a storm. We were forced under the water of the ocean. Katara Oh, I see. Aang It wasn't very smart. I was just upset. Thanks for saving me. Katara Lucky. Aang I probably should get home. They'll all be worried. Katara You're not still upset? Aang Not as much as I was. Outside, Zuko's ship smashes through the icy landscape toward the village. Sokka later leads a train of children into the igloo Sokka The Fire Nation is here. Katara What? Sokka And they brought their machines. Katara was heading out of the igloo with Sokka, then turned to Aang Sokka Don't come out till I tell you it's safe. Aang Is something wrong? Katara No. Please wait here. Zuko enters the village with his men. Zuko's soldier #1 Hurry, now! Zuko's soldier #2 Secure the area. Sokka It can't be coincidence that we break him out of the ice, light shoots into the sky and now the Fire Nation is here with their machines. Sokka reaches for his boomerang behind him, about to use it against Zuko. Katara Sokka, don't. Zuko takes off his helmet before addressing the villagers. Zuko I am Prince Zuko ... son of Fire Lord Ozai and heir to the throne! Bring me ... all your elderly! Child villager Papa! Zuko's soldier #3 Move! Villager Yeah? Katara Grandma! Villager Please don't ... don't harm him! Zuko's Soldier Come on! The soldiers then took out several elderly villagers, including Kanna, the grandmother of Sokka and Katara. Furious, Katara was about to use her waterbending. Sokka Katara, don't. Zuko's soldier #4 Form a line Zuko's soldier #5 Come on! Zuko's soldier #6 Here. Villager Hey. Child villager Grammy! One of the soldiers finds Aang in the igloo with some children. Upon noticing his tattoos, he is brought to Zuko. Zuko is astonished to find the tattoos that he seemingly recognized its significance. Aang You're scaring these people. Zuko Who are you? What's your name!? Aang I don't need to tell you anything. Zuko Firebenders! [Zuko's soldiers move into positions.] I'm taking you to my ship. If you don't come, I'll burn down this village. Aang I'll go with you. Don't hurt anyone. Aang follows Zuko and his men to the ship. The villagers move closer when a firebender sends out flame over their heads. Sokka and the villagers duck. They helplessly watch Aang being taken away. Cut to the igloo. Sokka They were looking for someone old and they were looking for someone with the same markings the boy had. Katara They dragged Mom away the same way when we were babies. She wouldn't have watched us being taken away. She would have fought. We found that boy. He's our responsibility. We should fight. What would you do if they tried to take me away? Sokka I'd kill them all. Katara Why? Sokka Because you're my sister. Because Dad told me to protect you with my life. Katara Because I'm your responsibility. And this boy is our responsibility. Sokka What do you want us to do, Katara? How are we supposed to save him? They're on a ship. We'd need a miracle to catch them. I know you think everything's going to work out, but I don't. Appa wails louder and louder. When Sokka and Katara hear the sound of laughing children, they immediately go outside to see what is going on. The bison creature floats in the air as if wanting to follow his master, but is held back out of concern of the children hanging dangerously off his feet. Katara His bison creature thing floats. Zuko's ship moves across the icy waters. Aang is kept in a room. The door opens, and Iroh and Zuko walk in. Iroh is amazed to see a young surviving airbender. Aang What do you want with me? Iroh My nephew wants me to perform a little test on you. Aang What kind of test? Iroh I assure you, it won't hurt. I've performed it hundreds of times. It only",

I'm told it's unusually for not actually requiring repetitive clicking as you can hire managers to 'click' for you. But it does follow the formula of buying upgrades to earn more money with which you can buy upgrades to earn money faster.   The heart of the game is good. There are three worlds included, and usually one event (7 days) per month.   The issue is one of balance. Earth is impossible to complete. Even people who have cheated to give themselves thousands of dollars worth of pay-to-win currency have estimated that it will take 10,000+ years to complete Earth. Believe it or not, this is a substantial improvement after several patches which were supposedly made 'Earth is now completable'.   After seeing the developers spend over a year and several patches without having a completable Earth, and seeing incredible swings in whether the events move too quickly or too slowly, I have gradually come to understand that none of the developers actually understand exponential growth to correctly balance the game. While it is otherwise well-polished and even fun for Mars and Moon (mostly), I no longer have confidence that the developers will be able to balance Earth nor the events. Accordingly, on a yes/no scale, I rank it no.",

Then i thought to myself 'what in the **** am I doing with my life?'  Then I thought I was crazy and I went for the angels  Back at day one, then I only realized that I only got 8% bonus from the angels  I was mad for 1 minute  took a deep breath.......*inhale*  'ok, back to clicking fictional lemons'  10/10 the greatest fictional scam in my entire life.",

I don't think you can fail at game, just take longer to get more money. I read an earlier review that said it was a huge waste of time and I'll have to agree. The first hour isn't so bad, but after that a bit pointless and boring, in my opinion. I had it running in background and it slowed my computer down a ton. Not really sure why I had it running in background (no point really), but it was a bad idea, made computer super laggy. Only thing I can say is good thing it was free.",

Most reviews for this game are either 'lel money making simulator 2045 10/10 would make money again'  or  'le Fat Bearded Valve Steam Man Simulator'  'Positive Reviews' be damned. Don't bother wasting your time with it.  You start off by buying a Lemonade Stand.  Then you build from there. Buying things like Pizza Deliveries, Hockey Teams, etc. Once you get enough money you can buy 'Auto-Clickers' or 'Managers' as the game calls it. The 'Managers' will automatically generate the money for you. And from that point you don't have to do anything. You use the money the 'Managers' have made for you and buy more things that generate more money You can buy more than one of the 'Businesses' which will net you with more money. So you can have like 50 Movie Studios that generate millions of dollars.  There is also a 'New-Game+' of sorts. You can sell your business to get 'Angels'. That means you'll have to start from scratch The 'Angels' will then give you a boost when you start over. Like a higher percentage of money earned and special upgrades that require 'Angels'  It's Free-To-Play for sure, but there is also an option to buy, with real world money, 'Gold Bars' to speed up the money making process. It definitely isn't needed, but you need to ask yourself if it's really worth spending money on something like this. The lowest price for 'Gold Bars' is $1.99USD, but don't let that low price gimp you into actually spending money on this. People with terrible spending habits will feed the machine and tell themselves 'It's only 2$ I can afford it', but then you end up spending 10$ or more. Things like that add-up. Sure it's a small investment at first, but if you're terrible with money you'll end up spending way more than what the game is worth. Just think if a game like Candy Crush were to appear on Steam with it's stupidly genius money making scheme.  The person would be rolling in the money. Just look at some of the people with Steam Levels over 30 (Myself Included) Or if Steam itself happened to do things like have you use real world money to buy things like hats or steam cards.  There is no real goal other than to let the game make money. You don't even have to have it running for it to make money. When the Program isn't running it will still continue to make money so the next time you decide to run it again you'll see how much you made during your time 'offline'  If you want something similar you can go and play Cookie Clicker It's the same thing. Or you can go on Kongregate and play this.  And those options are DRM Free",

It's a little bit like those Facebook games where you have to take care of a restaurant or a farm but without the anoying friend help you have to constantly ask for and without having to build anything. This game is pretty amazing because it only is about making cash... THIS IDEA IS AS SIMPLIST AS GREAT! You'll pretty much end up addicted, good luck.   Pros:  - Free - Time consuming - Addictive (truly)  Cons: - Not fully immersive, which is quite normal since this type of game is not made for spending hours ONLY on it, plan on doing other things while playing to make sure you don't give up after an hour.

I am now at the point in which I have not the slightest hint of an idea of how many zeroes do the numbers I'm dealing with have. What the ♥♥♥♥ is a Quadraquigintillion? If a Billion has 9 zeroes, and every number above the '2' in Billion has 3 more, I dare not try to think of how many zeroes the '54' version of it has. I know that 10^100 was along the lines of a vigintillion. But that's not important. What is important is that this game is evil.  There's even a mobile version of it.

But you can't blame the developers for that.  So what's really bad about this game? Microtransactions. The game tries to sell you gold bares for real money. You may think 'It's your own choice if you want to spend money on it.' But that's too native because it doesn't apply to addicts because their decising-making ability is impaired. So those people will spend money and waste a lot of their time on the game possibly to a degree where it harms their daily life.  It's about getting people addictive and abusing their addiction to get money. Did the developers develop this game with this specific intention? Well, companies don't develop games for free and some only develop games to get money. A few gaming companies are researching about gaming addiction and use this knowlegde to get money with addictive games (the mobile games sector is the best example).

PS - I'm biased because I hate the free2play model where paying customers get some type of advantage over the free customers; which makes actually makes the free player experience feel like a demo of the game. In fact, it's well known that free games cost more than pay2play games (if you wanted the full experience) which is why companies design games to be sold like this.

It all starts off with a lemonade stand, the idea is you buy some lemonade and you sell lemonade at a higher cost. Thus, begins the madness.  You will spend the money earned to buy other businesses such as newspaper delivery, banks and oil companies to name a few from the low and high end.  The businesses you buy can be upgraded with a huge list of upgrades to increase your profits. Thankfully there’s managers to work for you so you’re not endlessly clicking away wasting your life. The game earns money while you sleep, so you can have a social life as well, amazing!  There’s a lot of strategy here when you have to deal with angel investors, as you become rich, your angel investors grow and you have to decide when to reset to gain the angels to earn money faster. Working this out is when the fun begins.  This is a strange game. I don’t know why I like it honestly, it’s a complete waste of time. I like it because I won’t see this money in my lifetime, so it’s nice to see all this money per second. A man can dream!

Your assets are small at first - mostly lemonade stands and car washes. But clicking on them over time gives you the cash needed to buy everything from a movie studio to an oil company. Buying multiples of the same business exponentially increases cash flow, and hiring automatic managers frees up your finger for other, less menial tasks. Employees even have great off-brand names to match their businesses like shrimp magnate Forest Trump. The manager mechanic streamlines one of the biggest annoyances of (ugh) the clicker genre, but it's not the only helpful addition. When money reserves get out of control players can choose to buy businesses in groups of ten or a hundred to quickly drain excesses. Different upgrades improve different businesses at different times, occasionally changing up which investment is the best. And once players have gotten to the top, they can choose to start again from the bottom by wiping the slate clean and acquiring stat-modifying angel investors. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps you lazy parasite! Along with Randian flair, the option adds strategy and replayability that many contemporaries lack. But perhaps the most entertaining part of AdVenture Capitalist is how it works as an inadvertent Marxist manifesto. As players sell their time and their souls into this hollow, endless machine out of nothing but sheer greed, they'll understand the horror of our current economic system. The peppy music and illustrated Monopoly-style graphics contrast nicely with the ruthless enterprise. Plus, players can get a bonus by watching an actual ad - absolutely shattering the line between simulation of predatory dealings controlled by the player and actual predatory dealings at the player's expense. If you view it as just another clicker game, AdVenture Capitalist is upbeat but kind of a waste of time. But if you view it as another reason to burn down the 1%, it becomes a lot more thought-provoking.",

You will not feel required to do micro transactions and the once you buy will not leave you feeling robbed.  Weak because if you do not want a skinner box there is nothing that tricks you into wanting to play it like in candy crush or Farmville-esque games, etc. It is a “watch the numbers go higher and the fancy lights flash” kind of game and that is all.  I sort of like this game when I play it on my phone, but I do not think this is a very good pc-game.

I think this could be solved if you add in other modes; E.g. a timed mode, or maybe after adding some gimmicks a mode where you have to do specific things (E.g. get 1000 lemonade stands to win) to the experience.  Overall it is free now and I see how this game makes its money, but I would've bought this game even if it was £4.99. But if this game keeps developing and going the way it is with it's cool Hippo designers, then I think this could turn into a memorable fully fledged steam game, and I could end up paying more for it, if not for steam greenlight.

Whilst it seems simple, remember the growth is pseudo exponential. The first 100 lemon shops are cheap, the last 100 are mindblowingly expensive.

I've played this game quite a bit and still haven't hit a point where I haven't felt like playing anymore. When you feel like you've hit the wall and aren't getting anywhere, close the game for a while and come back later that day or even the next day and boom! now you have more investors and more money and you can buy things or just reset and get to that point faster. It takes time to reach the point where you can afford to unlock the moon or mars, but the great thing about this game is that you can close it and leave it for days to get where you need to be. It's not an idle game that needs babysitting like a lot of idle games do. Once you buy a good chunk of investments leave it and come back later and you'll do perfectly fine.",

There is no other paragraph I could write, so…  Do I recommend? I do have more than 100 hours of gameplay, but I did not really play all those 135 hours, the game was just open all day, so do not think I really sat there for that time, but the game is somehow addictive even though it really has no point (But I certainly did sit there a while). Yes, I still do sometimes open it and upgrade stuff, but I would have rather not done so. Please do not waste your time like me, still I cannot deny that it is probably better that most other games where you do the same click-upgrade-click things. But on the other hand the game will not harm you and it does feel good to get a certain upgrade, I only feel a bit dumb because of the time I spent with this, which I would wish to get back, though while playing it I did not really mind. I do not want to recommend it, but at the end I did enjoy it. I feel so sad right now for saying that... ",

It's a great model for time-waster games, as it doesn't bar you from the rest of the content if you leave for extended periods. When you come back, it'll gleefully open it's arm and give you your investors and dollars. It's fascinating. I spent years with this game, mostly in offline mode for reasons. (Time and date modification.) It has kept me coming back, but i've finally reached the pinnacle.  Now AC is on console. A friend of mine tried it out, and was hooked. He told me while the game is sweet and all. The beginning is gruesome, and can honestly be a bit of a turn off on how slow it takes. It took him 5 days to get one angel investor up and running, and when he did. He was a bit displeased. It wasn't as effective as thought. I made 1000% my investors in less then a hour on every reset. So I couldn't understand.  The game is slow in the beginning, but once you learn, and pick it up after a reset. The game accelerates into that capitalist feeling you've been waiting for.",

There are a set of timers, click to start one, when that timer reaches zero you get money. Timers are enabled by purchasing them, and the cost of an additional 'payout' in a particular category of timers appears to increase 10% over the previous cost - ie:  #1 = $10.00 #2 = $11.00 #3 = $12.10  Total cost for 3 = $33.10   The astute player might decide to do maths to choose what to spend money on, however the game doesn't display the time required or payout for timers you haven't bought... actually the game doesn't display the total time required for any timer. Instead you have to pay attention to the moment the countdown starts and record the first value.  You can buy (one time cost) managers to click on the timers for you, and the accrual continues when you quit the game, so if you log back in a week later I imagine you can buy everything... (well one of everything...)  The game keeps track of the total amount of money you've made, but somehow doesn't calculate the rate or give you a profitability breakdown... or any meaningful feedback. I didn't even see a way to compare my progress against other players or time limited leaderboards or anything.  Frankly this 'game' can be completely experienced in 20 minutes, and the experience isn't good. ",

So what if I used cheats? The game would take about 3 years to finish normally.  On to the factors: - The point of the game is to build a business in a cookie clicker type style of buy, wait, buy, wait, etc. - Hundreds of upgrades, but they're just mostly the same with a new name - Once you get enough money, you get angel investors by restarting the game - Angel investors are used in upgrades - Same feature as before, finish, invest in angels by restarting, repeat - Seemingly unlimited possibilities of amount of money (million, billion, trillion... ...septsexagintillion, you get the point.) - Not very many achievements  I don't whether to reccomend this game or not.

I find it to be a fun little game to pass the time without passing any time at all if that makes sense. You start at the bottom of the everything; you're poor, you're slow at making money, and it feels as though you'll never be on the top. While it may be a cookie clicker-esque game, it still has much to offer in it's features. You can go from selling lemonades to finding oil. You may buy managers which help you buy things faster. This game also features many upgrades to keep you compelled. However, other things in this game can also make you stay interested. Let's say you have to go to work, school, or church. Would you want to leave the game? No. But don't worry because as you're away the game will make money for you as you're away (I went to school earlier and came back to see 54 trillion dollars). The only complaint I have with this game? DO NOT PLAY IF YOU HAVE ZERO PATIENCE! IT WILL BORE YOU! I believe it's an extremly addictive game for you to get hooked on and would recommend it to every one of my friends.",
