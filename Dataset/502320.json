            "review_text": "Great iteration of Boulder Dash. I've played the mobile versions as well, and like to finally be able to play on a keyboard and controller - best experience. Always wanted to take a shot at building levels for a game like this, and so far, the built in editor seems to do the job pretty well. Glad to see classics like this get a present day update that's still fun to play. ",
