            "review_text": "This would make for a fun battle system in a larger game like an RPG, or an extra mode in a larger action game. But on its own, Croixleur Sigma just falls short and feels like an incomplete game.   I can't really say I would recommend this at the asking price of $7.99, but for a couple of bucks on sale, or maybe grabbed in a bundle with other games, it feels more worth it.   Croixleur is basically a hack and slash game with very simple mechanics. There are no complex combos, or even intermediate ones. We're talking simplest of the simple here when chaining together attacks. It's basically button mash, dash away to dodge attacks, and once in a while throw in an 'invincible' special. The arenas are all the same. Just a circle you run around in, with different colors. Someone said this feels like Bloody Palace mode in the Devil May Cry games. But that is just the thing, the Bloody Palace Mode was just a mode in a larger game, and a much deeper game at that in terms of combat.   As it stands on its own, the story mode is just too short, with literally only 3 types of bosses, with 2 of the boss types becoming standard enemies after you beat them, which can be dropped with the greatest of ease with a simple hit hit dash, rinse and repeat set of moves. As for the standard enemies there are 3 types, with a few levels of difficulty for each. It's just...wow. Lazy. Besides story mode, you can tackle a time attack, survival and challenge mode. And that's pretty much it.   There are 2 characters to play as, with 20 weapons total to use once you unlock them all. There is not much difference in any of the weapons other than attack power, their special, and of course the weapon skins. For basic attacks they are pretty much all similar.  I have less than an hour in the game. Yes, less than an hour. But in that hour I managed to play through story mode twice. Once making it as far as the timer allowed, and the 2nd time actually completing story mode, and then to try out the other modes afterwards. I am already bored with the title.   Buy this I guess if you like repetitive score attack type action games with extremely little style and substance.",

I like the 2 player mode on this. I haven't played the 2 player mode but I have seen one short video on it and the developers did a great job with the camera in 2 player mode. This game is similar to 'Devil May Cry' bloody palace mode, only this is less demonic. Anywas, it's one of my favorite games in my library.",

If you want a varieted game of this type, i recommend Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires wich you can find here on Steam likewise with Metal Gear Rising.  There is nothing original to see here. Still, i do not regret taking a break from western games wich are all the same lately. Asia for the win........just not this time!",

Talking about character wont jump until like the 5th time you hit jump, or the character wont dash until 2seconds later(Not always but there will be those moments you're like 'MOVE DAMN IT!')  Its cute, I hope later updates add more to this game. I would say get it if you like fast hack and slash just to blow off some steam killing things, other wise theres not much to this game. The towers about 20 levels that you complete in 15minutes. And you can see I've played for about 2hours and unlocked a number of the achievement for this game.
