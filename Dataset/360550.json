            "review_text": "Ahh Cursed Sight, I've been following this and the Developer (Invert Mouse, certainly worth following, he makes some cool stuff here on Steam :D) And I'm happy to say that this was an AWESOME read!  There isn't much I can explain about the characters and setting (I really don't want to spoil anything, You need to see that for yourself!) but to give a general idea, this Novel starts off with the Protagonist, Gai arriving as a servant to East Taria, as his Parents from West Taria have sold him off as a Slave to the Temple. He is then assigned the Duty of taking care of the needs of a Girl named Miyon who has the 'Cursed Sight' This gives her the power to perform rituals that can alter Fate and various scenarios the Regions ruler may desire.  Onto the Technical Side of things  Audio - The soundtrack is very suiting for both the situations and environments it is used in, it is certainly nice to listen to and really helps add to the experience when it gets to more intense story parts. The Audio REALLY complements these well!  Visual - The backgrounds are all pretty and certainly help you imagine the way the area is designed to be. The characters are also wonderfully drawn and to the standard that many VN fans would enjoy, the art takes a very good approach in being pretty and sometimes cute, but also feeling very powerful and succeeds in conveying character emotion when it needs to.  To summarise - This Novel is certainly worth a read in many ways, Your getting a great reading experience with 4 different endings (the true extra ones the best : P). You'd be supporting an awesome Indie Dev who absolutely deserves positive attention. And lastly, it's not that expensive either, your certainly getting Your monies worth! I can say I enjoyed this Novel a lot and will now be proceeding to buy the Digital Artbook and the Original Soundtrack!  And Lastly, Thanks to InvertMouse for this wonderful story : D",

But I really enjoyed this game, it was heartbreaking and I cried a lot at the end. I've never played a game that made me cry so much, loved the characters, art style and soundtrack. You guys did a great job and all I have to say is thank you. Thank you for all the tears that I've dropped, damn ninjas cutting onions behind me.  I'm glad I could experience a great story like this during my life. Thank you. Thankyougai. Thankyoumiyon. ",

The characters are great and will really speak to you if you allow them to.  It's kinda short so it may not be worth full price, but I personally feel it was a great buy/read regardless of paying full price for 4 hours of reading... and that was because I was talking to people over steam.   I'd love to have more to say than that but I can't without spoiling the experience.",

            "review_text": "I'm a big visual novel fan, and I was initially hesitant on purchasing this visual novel due to it being outside of my eastern-origin visual novel comfort zone, but I went against my gut instinct and bought it anyway. After playing the game and achieving all 4 endings I am still not sure about my feelings towards the game.  The beginning of the novel started out at a nice pace, providing insights into the world that Gai was from and the society he was being thrown into. The narration, background art, and music was all stunning during the first 20 minutes of the game, and had me completely hooked.  Unfortunately once the character Sasa was introduced I felt as though I could slowly tell where the story was going, and some of the major plot points became predictable. Suddenly the music and background art became repetitive, and the narration had turned into something more light hearted, with some sort of slapstick humor occurring every other scene.  By the middle of the game I felt like I was reading something entirely different than what I had originally enjoyed. Miyon, who had been a very interesting character to me from the start, became a hollow tsundere, and Gai seemed to become more immature and annoying despite 8 years passing since the beginning of the game. Each ending felt rushed, and I was disappointed with the 'true ending' which was only unlocked after viewing the other 3.   Despite everything I have said I would recommend this game to someone new to visual novels, or trying to get into the genre. It is an easy read, and few choices have to be made during the game. I found the concept of 'cursed sight' to be enjoyable, but the execution of it was not quite to my tastes. Overall I would give this game a 5/10. ",

It felt clumsy and choice of words were weird or didn't really suit within the story.  To me, it looked like the writer doesn't have much experience, or is very young. Having good beta viewers or editors for the text would have been a good idea.  It looked good, but I just couldn't enjoy it, because writing and good characters are what I look for in my visual novels.",
