    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows XP/7/8/10 I guess it would run on Win98 as well. Not sure about Windows 3.1 Processor: Oh gee I don't know. It's built with RPG Maker MV so I guess ANY? Intel Core Duo will suffice. Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: You can literally run it with a potato. It worked on my office computers that had only some lame oldschool chipset. Storage: 250 MB available space Sound Card: Oh yeah it would help if you had one.",
