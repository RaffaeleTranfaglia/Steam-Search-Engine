            "review_text": "It plays just like Far Cry 3, with more. better map, more weapons, etc. Sure it's similar to FC3 with the liberating of outposts and control towers, but there's a lot of new content and places to explore.   Smooth gameplay, good models, beautiful scenery, ambient sounds.. it's a lot of fun. I'm really enjoying just walking around doing my own thing, discovering locations just by chance, with my bow and arrow ready to take down any wild animals I come across.   Lots of interface options too, so you can remove the minimap and other helpers, and take off auto tagging when u aim a weapon at a bad guy to make the experience more immerseful.  Well, im sure there's a bunch of professional indepth reviews coming to help you decide whether or not to buy it, but if u loved FC3, then u'll love this too!  I haven't come across any major bugs yet, I have the graphics on ultra and occasionally get some sort of flickering effect now and then, but nothing to dampen the enjoyment of playing..  *update!* This flickering effect appears to be some sort of tree glitch, where trees are changing between a detailed 3D model to a 2D model rapidly, and this has been solved by updating nVidia driver to 344.75 :)  As for controls, they are fine. Only thing I had to adjust is the look sensitivity for the mouse, felt too low on default.  My system is quite high end so I haven't experienced any lag, crashes or framerate drops, which seem to the the basis for all the negative reviews so far..",

            "review_text": "Far Cry 4 takes Far Cry 3's excellent gameplay and refines it to near-perfection. One thing you will notice when running around is that the game feels a lot like Far Cry 3, but a lot of the annoyances are fixed. Falling damage isn't nearly as brutal, and takes a longer fall to trigger it; simply jumping while running on a slight slope will no longer take half your health. The driving physics are also much-improved, and the vehicles, though similar-looking, are more useful and a bit more capable off-road. The pickup trucks no longer look so generic, and actually strongly resemble older-model vehicles of a particular US brand. You also get access to a wider variety of powerful weapons much sooner than in FC3.  Skill progression in FC4 is much more open than in FC3. There's fewer restrictions based on where you are at in the campaign. Sometimes you do have to accomplish a particular feat or task to unlock a skill, but it always tells you what you have to do so it isn't hard to figure out. Side missions are much more varied and rewarding.  The biggest problem I've had is that the game tends to stutter a bit randomly, for no real reason, and my machine exceeds the recommended hardware in every way. I am sure a future patch will fix this, but it is a bit annoying at times.  Overall, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3, you'll love Far Cry 4. It takes everything great about Far Cry 3 and improves it.",

            "review_text": "I think I will finally put out my thought on this game. First off Im sorta ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about the bad reviews I've seen on metacritic and other places due to the fact that it takes a good PC to run. A lot of people have found 'bugs' that is obviousally them trying to run the game on very low without the required settings and are discovering issues due to that. Ok now that I've said that heres MY review  Singleplayer:   The only negative thing is that it is kinda repitive when it comes to the other FC games, beyond that it is fantastic. It keeps a lot from FC3 and adds a whole lot more. The world seems a little smaller, yet. For those who dont know:  Far Cry is an Open world game, meaning that you can go around and do quests, campaign missions unlock more of the map, take outposts and do whatever the hell you want. Its also a First Person Shooter and ties the FPS and OW together very well.  The world of Far Cry 4 takes place in a fictional city called Kyrat, that is located in the Himilayas, you can hunt animals to skin them and craft sacks to carry more of any given item. the game also features enemy outposts where youy can gain an XP bonus for how you take it, the less detected you are, the more XP you get. Now as XP goes I wanna talk about are the skills, instead of 3 groups like we had in FC3, we have 2, Elephant and tiger, Elephant is more defensive whereas Tiger is Attack. there is no tatoo however ( thank god. it was kinda weird) The quests I havent diven into that much, however there are popup quests around the map as you travel called Karma that will give you Karma XP, which basically as it would suggest, shows how reputable you are with your tribe, Golden Path (Thats what it called right?) If you gain enough XP you can call in troops to help fight with you, however you cant call them in during a mission, which i find sorta annoying.   The next thing is that co op isnt seperate anymore, instead you can aid eachother in single player, mainly to take down the fortressess. Which are like huge, well guarded outposts. Another thing is animals in the game. They are very tough and start to become a quick problem. However a new feauture can counter this. When you skin an animal, you take its meat and put it in a bait sack, bait is one of your throwable objects, animals will go eat the bait then attack the next thing closest, so you can throw bait into a crowd of enemies to get an animal to attack them. The last thing I wanna talk about is the campaign. I'm not gonna spoil anything, however there are 2 seperate sets of missions after you hit the 6th or 7th missions. So, you can play the game twice and have most of the missions be different.  Multiplayer:   It is amazingly fun. It is 5v5 and there are 3 different modes. The maps are GIGANTIC! you can use the wingsuit to fly around the map, and the Golden Path can use guns and vehicles, and the enemy act as hunters which are enemies that have bows and can turn invisable. So you get bows and can ride elephants. You also get 2 Special Tipped arrows and you can summon animals to attack the Golden Path. There are usaully 2 10 minute halves depending on the game mode. You are one team for the first half, then switch for the second.  Overall this game is amazing. I HIGHLY reccomend   10/10  PS This is my first indepth review. Let me know if its any good. ",

            "review_text": "10/10 Would share Crab Rangoon with a mad king again   Real review below EDITED on Nov 22  Farcry 4 is a build on what made farcry 3 good, and attempts to fix some things associated with it. Some things were fixed, some were not, and some were broke.   =The Good=  -More guns, always good, literally the game designers seem to have said 'Lets keep most of FC3's guns, but then add a ton of awesome guns from all time zones'. Only complaint is the sawed off forces you to shoot both barrels at once, but in all honesty thats a small complaint, the thing is death, literally, death used to carry this gun under his cloak and it fell out when he was hiking in kyrat.   -More area to discover and explore  -much more stuff to do  -replayable outpost missions  -dont have to stare at hands the whole game, now you get gloves! (Cant be changed but still)  -Added gyrocopters  -Co op in main game, with hurk, a man with brilliance unmatched   -can shoot one handed weapons from driver seat (But oddly cant use two handed ones from passenger seat?)  EDIT:-There are more random things to do now than there were, from chasing couriers to blowing up caravans, but these events take a matter of seconds and dont really challenge the player. I Took down a convoy of three vehicles with 3 shots from a shotgun, without leaving my vehicle. the fun missions, assassinations, hostage rescues and the like, are not replayable.   EDIT: WOW! Just looked in the options menu, not only are outposts replayable, you can actually RESET them ALL to hostile, that is awesome. This allows players to replay the game in a more hostile setting even after beating it, and means, unlike the outpost master replay things, you can actually approach the outpose how you see fit, big Plus here  =The unchanged=  -Some weapons have an utterly paltry amount of attatchements and many are completely made  obsolete late game, something i always despise. (This isnt as bad as FC3 though, im still using the mauser to good effect late game and it was an early game pistol, still wish i could mod it)  -the wing suit still kills you more often than you actually get to use it. Likes to turn on when trying to get takedowns or jumping roof to roof, carreening you into a wall and instant death  -Lacking enemy selection, despite being a dictatorship and rich, pagan's forces have no tanks, no real military vehicles, etc.   -0 Customization, you are this kid, Ajay Ghale, nothing more, theres some story to him but its really pretty simple. no clothing changes, and very limited weapon customizing, hes less of a stupid teen than Jason was though, which is nice.   -Signature weapons are still around, yuck, i wanna make my own killing tool, not use one the game designers cooked up.   -Uplay means you need another game launcher and as a result, more lag.  =The Broken =  -no save slots, so once youve beat the game with whatever choices you made, if you wanna try again, start all over, erasing data.  -Extremely laggy and prone to locking up at bad times, reminds me of malaria from farcry 2, i have a REALLY good computer and it still lags on LOW settings. EDIT: Recent patch has made it less laggy, still cant put it on high graphics without the computer locking up, but theres less lag overall.   -Simple, lacking story. Not so bad considering you are only gonna do it to unlock stuff and then go play with said stuff, but still. it would be nice to look forward to story missions instead of loathing them.   -While there is far more choice in this story compared to farcry 3, its still always gonna end with the player mostly unhappy with how it went.   -Once you make a certain choice, a big part of the story literally bloody disappears and nothing further happens (Bahdra)  -Pagan is extremely interesting but doesnt show up at all really, save for little radio calls every now and then, and if you make the moral choice in the end thats that, the game is over. You can now run about playin' around wondering what really was going on. Wanna try the other ending? restart the game, all over....EDIT: It honestly seems like the gaming trend is to make the player regret their choices no matter the ending. I read the other path, to see what happens if you dont shoot in the end, and honestly shooting is still the right choice BUT you miss out on ALOT of plot, so i recommend not shooting.   -Dying shortly after missions can cause important mission info to not be told over the radio, and you can miss out on plot  EDIT:- The devs seem to feel a need to put mass drugs into these games, to get completion, you have to subject Ajay to the same trippy treatment in a questline of about...5 missions? each is almost literally unchanged from the last. You wake up in Kyrat with pink and green fog, and run to three checkpoints looking for the two who gave you the drugs, then it ends. Very uninteresting missions, I dont think they should be there honestly, seem to exist just so the devs can stick needles in Ajay   I will add more as i play  WAYS TO FIX CERTAIN BUGS If you find your car is trying to drive itself or auto aim is on, go into options, to gamepad, and turn those to manual and off, etc. The game thinks you have a remote and is trying to set up for that.   If certain parts of your sound go out, fast travel somewhere and it should be fixed. It seems going to certain outposts can maks some sounds, such as reloading, stop working  ==Do i recommend this game? == yes, its fun, despite all this. in the moments where there is no lag, no stupid guy on the radio singing praises to a drug queen, you can have legit fun. Maybe not customized to perfection, but still. You CAN have fun and WILL, often even. Flying a gyrocopter and blasting cars below with a grenade launcher is fun, chasing a truck weildding a double barrel shotgun in one hand from an ATV is FUN!",

            "review_text": "Far Cry 4 is basically Far Cry 3 with a new story on top; you still capture towers and outposts. Gameplay mechanics are almost verbatim. If you liked FC3, then you should be able to enjoy FC4. I enjoyed both games but grew tired of the mechanics by the end of FC4.  As FC3 was graphically demanding, FC4 is more graphically demanding. I only started playing after the 1.6 patch and I've not experienced any bad hitching. You will need to take into consideration that you may not be able to crank up all details and get a smooth experience, so drop details until you can maintain your desired frame rate. FC4 is very pretty, though, and that's what really kept me going. I ran it with a Galaxy GTX 780 HOF with an overclock on the RAM, which helps quite a bit; FC4 loves to use everything it can. The graphics are very nice, so it's definitely not just wasting energy on the GPU.  I recommend Far Cry 4, but consider that it is very similar to Far Cry 3 and judge for yourself what that is worth to you.",

However the mouse acceleration is still present and anoying. TB also mentions this in his status report video (totalbuscuit on youtube. check it out!)  I can almost recomend the game now. Wait a week or two and these issues might have been fixed... not sure  Old review below! no need to read... but left it in for reference:  Please read before you buy! Expensive game, expensive pain....  I've played for about 5 - 6 hours now. I have to say it is better than I first expected. The game is super awesome! It is a lot like far cry 3 like people are saying. Not that it is a bad thing. there's still a ton of new features and fun things to do. Characters are great and interesting and the world look awesome! The animals are way more lethal now and how many uses. both for you and the enemies.   But... why the hell would you not recomend it OP?   Good question random gamer.   I can not recomend this game to anyone at this state. The main reason is the microstutter and mouse acceleration. The in-game options have mouseacceleration turned off yet the game still have it enabled. It is super anoying to aim and the mouse controlls just feels inconsistent and sluggish. Far cry 3 had a little bit of this but not nearly as bad. Raw mouse input would solve this probably... GET ON IT UBISOFT!   The other thing is the stuttering. I have a GTX 980 and my fps are as high as you would expect them to be. However, despite the high fps the game lags. I am pretty sure it is some kind of in-engine lag.   So do not expect a true smooth pc experience with this game. I hope Ubisoft listens (as they never do) and fixes these problems asap. Until then i can not recomend this game.",

            "review_text": "There a two ways you can play this game. I will give an example, I rode an elephant into pagan min's fotress armed with a chaingun, grenades, two different cars covered in c4 blew the gates down after I let them ride into the base, my friend was above me in a gyrocopter with a grenade launcher and together we stomped (literally) the entire population of the base including the reinforements.  The second way is easily just as fun. I snuck in the base alone armed with nothing but my kukri, an autocross and a bow. Slowly I snuck my way over to the sniper's nest I preformed a takedown on one and threw a knife at the other simultaneously. No one noticed. Then I made my way to the two other sniper platforms, preforming takedown after takedown knife throw. Finally all of the snipers were taken care of. Then I took down two people by leaping down from a rooftop onto his head, I stuck a knife in his throat and spun quickly to his partner before any alarm could be raised. I took their bodies and placed them carfully underneath a table. Around the corner a heavy gunner walked. He had heavy armor on, I could not kill him with my bow or crossbow. So I snuck behind him and stuck a knife in his neck. There were twelve more guards left. I took out six of them silently then aproched the last five on the center platform. I took down one then pulled my victims pisol out and shot the rest. I had liberated the outpost without raising any alarms.",

With that said it was really up to Ubisoft to give us an ultra polished and killer story, a few new tools to play with and exceptional presentation to sell us what is basically Far Cry 3 on a new map with new characters. They fail to do this and it's a step backwards in nearly every category from it's predecessor, Far Cry 3.  The story wasn't all that engaging, lip synching was way off in certain parts during dialogue [Far Cry 3 was stellar, like playing a movie], some things you do don't even make sense/matter/have a point at all [Yogi &amp; Reggie?], none of the characters really tie into one another like they were all written by different people in a silos and outside of a few new welcome events game play is virtually completely recycled content from Far Cry 3, and not even recycled well. In Far Cry 3 I would cringe going into radio towers, in this it was nothing. That was my experience with nearly everything in this game. The magic just isn't here.  I don't recommend it to anyone at full price. Hold off till this is $20 or less. What you're getting with Far Cry 4 is basically exactly what Blood Dragon did to Far Cry 3 and even that was more entertaining/original then this. It's a decent enough game on it's own, I guess, but held next to Far Cry 3... this is rather disappointing.  If you're starting the Far Cry franchise with this game, you're going to like it. Do yourself a huge favor though and check out Far Cry 3 afterwards and everything I've said here will make perfect sense. That title came out years ago and is superior in nearly every single way.",

Gameplay was the strongest part of FC3 in my opinion, though it did pretty good with it's kooky villains and the main character slowly transforming, out of necessity, into a brutal warrior out of a need to survive a harsh environment. So... in the gameplay department, things are more or less the same. And because of that, FC4 already is 'good enough' for me to recommend.  And yet something was missing. Maybe it was just that the main character didn't seem to have any personality or character growth this time. Maybe it was that the central story conflict which, while interesting, ensured that the ending would be basically bad no matter what. Maybe it was that it was just so damn similar to FC3 and yet... wasn't quite as good.  Honestly I didn't even finish the game properly. Yes I got to the ending, saw the epilogue scene with my chosen jerk leader, shot said leader in the head with a .50 cal sniper rifle after that scene, and saw the secret ending that happens at the start of the game. But I didn't do all the major side-quests, liberate all the outposts, or even get all of the upgrades. I ended up just plowing ahead through the story rather than taking my time to enjoy things. In other words... subconsciously, I wanted to be done with this and cut corners so I would be done relatively quickly.  So I guess this is actually a 'no' recommendation then? Ehh.... Is it a bad game? No, not really. It's just... bland. It has the gameplay that made FC3 great, but it does not have the same sort of story that kept me interested and wanting to see where things went. Yes FC3's second half was pretty bleh in the story department, but it didn't totally go to hell.  Far Cry 4 can be summed up as a 'safe' game where it tries to be Far Cry 3 again, but misses some of the key elements that made that game so memorable despite it's flaws. I see myself wanting to play Far Cry 3 again. This... I don't know.  This would be a 'maybe' if Steam had that option, but there isn't. So, honestly? I'm going to have to say 'No'. Play Far Cry 3 instead. It's better, has more than one save slot, and doesn't feel like a lazy sequel to cash in on a previous games success.  This game isn't bad. It's just... middling.",

            "review_text": "The only good game Ubisoft brought us 2014. Have to say that it isn't really something world breaking or really new compared to Far Cry 3, so people who were bored of FC3 should stay away, but the causual shooter fan will like that game.   It has exceptional weapon gameplay. Every weapon with its strong and weak points. It needs a bit testing to find your perfect loadout and i personally liked that a lot. You have to experiment and there are weapons for every situation you could come in. CQC or long range sniping. The armory has a wide range to offer.   The graphics are astounding. Like FC3 it is very colorful. Not as much as FC3 but still more than other shooters. It gives the game a more exotic look. On Ultra settings one of the best looking games i played in 2014.   The game mechanics are great. Yes there are bugs, but only few and none are gamebreaking. The sprint, slide, melee system works really well. The crafting as well. The loot system where you have to loot every single body gets annoying with time, but with time progression you don't need to do it anyway. So i can look over it.  The explosions and the overall balistic is great. If you blow up a truck with an RPG you can basically feel the impact of the rocket.  The stealth is very intuitive. If enemies spot you or not is measured by many factors and to me it always seemed fair.   The story is ... meh. It is easy to follow, but it just happens so aprupt. So fast. Here you are on the way to bring back the ashes of your mom to his home country and the next second you are the leader of a civil war. That was clearly to fast. the plot also goes too far away from the ashes and gets more and more to the 'we have to free our land from that bad man' attitutde. Which isn't really a bad thing at all, but a bit more emphasis on the whole 'why were you here again?' wouldn't have hurt.  The mission design gets a bit repetitive with the time. Yea i know it is a shooter, but especially most side missions are 'kill that' or 'collect this' The Main Quests are a bit better there.  Repetive or not, i never got really bored out of the missions. If you accept what the game is, then you can have a lot of fun with it.  I don't want to spoil muchm but the main missions and the decision making is very good here. On one hand you have the traditional guy who wants to bring back the old ways of Kyrat and on the other hand you have the gal that wants Kyrat to become more modern. It is just a minor factor, but the ways both sides try to achieve their goals put you into a dilemma. You really have to think about who you pick.   The characters are pretty good. You have bible reciting gun wielding priest, drug addicts etc. All characters have their little crazyness which makes em good :) People who liked Vas and his insanity will also like Pagan Min. He isn't as crazy and unpredictable as Vaas in FC3 but still well written psychopath.  The guy you play is called Ajay and there is where Ubisoft could have done better. Yes it is about decision making and all, but it wouldn't have hurt to give Ajay a bit more personality. In the end Ubisoft just rolled with 'you play as him. Play as you like' which isn't really a bad thing, but a bit more personality could have done the trick to get a bit more attached to Ajay.  One thing i really need to mention. I HATE the hunting. You kill Rhinos, Elephants, Tigers like nothing. Yes they attack you, but it doesn't feel right to me to blow up a Rhino with a RPG. That is a mechanic Ubisoft should reconsider.  Other than that minor thing. I highly recomment the game. It looks beautiful. It works great. There is a ♥♥♥♥ ton to do and with all the side mission and random stuff happening you never get bored. A must for every shooter fan.",

            "review_text": "Far Cry 4 is one of the best games I've played in so many ways, it excels at story, graphics, and gameplay in every way and can be played to a large extent. Starting with the story, I find it to be opposite of Far Cry 3, which had a storyline I found amazing as well. While Far Cry 3's strongest part of the storyline was the start, Far Cry 4 starred at the ending, an ending that may not be the same for everybody. As the game progresses there are multiple choices throughout it, unlike most FPS these choices change the storyline in drastic ways. So the story can shape towards what would seem more real to you personally. My only complaint about the story is how there was little sense to the fact that Ajay Ghale entered Kyrat being able to kill and fight at an experienced level, at least in Far Cry 3 they had trained Jason for a little bit and used the Tatao as a reason for his speedy ascent to master killer. But this hole in the story was greatly outshined as the game got better and better as time went. The graphics are most likely the most stunning of the time, sure the animals have some weird looking fur, but I can't blame Ubisoft for experimenting w/ that, other than that the lighting, texturing, and the environment all looked amazing. Finally, the gameplay, which some players accuse of being to similar to Far Cry 3. First of all, that is somewhat true, but why is that a bad thing? I mean I feel as if people expect more from games made by Ubisoft, and in return I feel like they try to pass limits they cannot pass and that is how glitchy games like Unity are born. It is not fair to be fine with multiple GTAs, multiple CODs, multiple battlefields, multiple Halos, and multiple of any game series and then complain that they made one game similar to their previous game that had such amazing gameplay. If Ubisoft had created something so amazing as Far Cry 3, why should they have to change in drastically after only one game? For every other developer adding just a new story and new graphics pleased the players, so why does it now please you when it happens for Far Cry 4? Also thats forgetting the fact that they did add a good amount of new things, such as riding elephants, grappling, gyrocopter, a bunch of new weapons, new takedowns, or new additions to mobility such as being able to shoot out of vehicles or takedown from one vehicle to another. Sure, those all can be considered small changes, but it is a hell of a lot more than most developers add in w/ a sequel. Also, do not forget the open world online Co-Op that they added in, being able to play w/ your friends in Kyrat adds a whole new feeling to the game. Not to mention the amazing map editor and the fact that you can create custom maps, then play with your friends. Reminds you a bit of Halo forge mode that so many people loved? (Sure not as good, but still a nice gesture to the game). Overall, I was verrry pleased with everything this game had to offer, and was dissapointed by the fact that some people found it to not be awe inspiring. 10/10 if you have the money you should buy this game, its worth every cent and more.",

And as for the main character, Ajay, he might as well just been a silent protaganist, i couldnt care less about him because he didnt develop in the slightest througout the story, whereas Jason Brody in far cry 3 started as this rich kid who probably never been stressed in his life, who is suddenly thrown into this chaotic world and you essentially watch him slowly become this psycho killer, bad ♥♥♥, and i wish we had that with Ajay.

The side activities are somewhat short but it's more enjoyable when you're doing it with your friend... Well, when you're not being disconnected from your friend.

In short: I enjoyed the game and recommend the purchase if you like shooter. With my current knowledge about the game I would buy it for max. 35€ (inc. Addons). If you don't like a repetitive gameplay you should watch a let's play first before buying. You'll get a good looking, rather light-minded, not very challenging but enjoyable shooter.  1. Presentation (4/5): If you like good graphics then you won't be disappointed. Objects, characters and wildlife are well designed and the animation doesn't lack in anything. The big bad point is that the world feels too monotonous to me. You'll see always the same colors and trees all over the map.  2. Story/Sidemissions/Objectives (2/5): The Story okay, definitly not overwhelming and far too short. If I hadn't cleared almost the whole map (opening chests, get the XP-Boosts, exploring points of interest), I could've be done in a few hours. The sidemissions are too repetitive. The 'drug-missions' are very well made. Clearing the points of interest (belltowers, outposts) become boring after 10h playtime.  3. KI/Gameplay/difficulty (3/5) Well, the gameplay is like the other FCs (2,3). The weapon-handling is simple and intuitive as always. I'm a bit bored by the Takedowns. I killed about 75% of all enemies with Takedowns because of the bonus-XP. To be honest: I could have used the guns but I'm an enthusiast when it comes to fast leveling. The KI is nothing special but serves the needs. KI-bugs are rare. The difficulty-level is definitly fair, maybe a bit too easy.  4. Characters (5/5) That's the big winner category here. Sabal, Amita and especially the antagonist Pagan Min are really really good. The side-mission characters are also very nice.  5. Equipment/Vehicles (4/5) Sometimes the equipment lacks in logic (parachute, wingsuit, bait) but the game is filled with an exciting weaponary and enough usable items to keep you entertained although it doesn't really matter which weapons you use. The vehicles are mostly awesome, especially  the Buzzer and the Hovercraft.",

Before you read the good and bad points, I believe it is worth playing but not for $60. Wait until it comes out on sale.   The Good:   The gunplay and on-the-fly killing is fantastic with the weapons given.   Elephants are one of the most overpowered things in the game and are great; until you name them and are murdered by a convoy truck that has no intention of stopping.   The wide variety of animals that can be hunted for karma and sold for money makes crafting relatively easy and funding abundant.   The antagonists and the rebels who assist you are well modeled and voice acted, but you only see them in cut scenes.   The Bad:   The framerate is horrendous when you move too fast even with a monster machine on High, not Very High or Ultra.    Singleplayer Offline Mode rubber-banding.    Outposts are repetitive and don't offer anything new.   Auto-Drive is an absolutely useless feature in the game that drives you to objectives so you can grab a beer and let the game play itself.   The story is unrewarding for your decisions and everyone you talk to shuts the door on your face or throws you out of a vehicle.   The main character is a bore and is a dope who dopes.

Playing FarCry is bittersweet for me. I enjoy the enviroment and storyline but I can't ignore the setbacks. I will give an example of such in my review. Others might have other examples but these are mine.  First, I feel like I am not as emersed in the world. The map is no longer a handheld map it's just another screen reminding me I'm playing a video game. Also, I have to see the heal option even if I want to ignore it (I know that I'm hurt). This is even when my interface is entirely turned off. I feel like I'm playing a 'dumbed' down version of FarCry. Guns no longer jam. I can not honk horns or choose when to turn lights (vehicle/flash) everything is auto. When Radio calls come in you do no even switch to your com device. No matter how much of the interface I turn off I still get interaction icons that will not go away.  On a positive note, I am excited about the map editor and continue to be delighted that this has not gone away from the series.   Co-op is awesome!! (with the right friend)  Driving and shoot! pew pew pew...  I feel like the PC version was an afterthought even though the series has been supported primarily by PC gamers (Map Makers etc..) until the release of FC3. My example is that my screen was black for this game until I unplugged all USB/Bluetooth Joysticks including my Microsoft Xbox 360 controller ?? After that the game worked fine using my trusty K-Board/Mouse.  The Characters are just as exciting, which is great. If the villians sadistic murder in the opening scene isn't enough for you, give it time.  I love FarCry's 'Final Fantasy' approach to the series. Even though it's a similar game, the storyline and characters change. I feel like this keeps the game that I love fresh.  The vehicle damage seems less realistic. Maybe it's just placebo effect, but it just doesn't seem natural the way it evolves.  I'm glad they kept a lot of my favorite weapons and added some new goodies to the arsenal.   DLC keeps the game exciting, but I'm worried that this game is heading down the path of many DLC traps. Make good games and gamers will support you. Trick us and we will DDoS you and Pirate you and stop supporting you overall. (anyways)  I would say this game gives me mixed feelings and I await some serious support patches. I would only recommend buying the game if it's on sale. I would say buy Farcry 2 or 3 first if you haven't enjoyed those titles yet.",

This is one of the best games I have ever played. The open world was done perfectly, you can just roam around and hunt or hunt down the royal army, you can try to capture outposts or do missions. This game feels extremely open, there is so much variety to the game. You can do almost anything that you want to. You can play any way you want, whether you like to play stealthy and toss rocks to distract guards while you sneak up and give them the work or you can just run in guns-a-blazin' with a huge variety of weapons.   The campaign was pretty fun, the missions are slightly more linear than the open world because if you stray too far from the zone, you get sent back to a checkpoint. The story was good and made you make some hard decisions. You can support Sabal who is all about maintaining tradition and morality or you can support Amita who is all about progress and preparing for the future but does not care about morality or religion/tradition at all. You get to make lots of choices in the game, you can kill certain targets or let them live.  The side missions are really cool. You can talk to Rabi Ray Rana and destroy propoganda centers, while he rambles on about all kinds of things. (He really cares about you, from the weapons you use to the water you use to clean your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) You can talk to Mr. Chiffon. He wants you to make all kinds of fashionable equipment that is also the highest tier of each equipment piece. To do this you have to hunt rare animals which are very tough to kill. There is even a funny joke when you do the honey badger one.  The weapons in this game are really vast. You can change the attachments on them to show your preference. You can pick some low-caliber silenced weapons and bows if you want to go stealthy or get some LMG's and rocket launchers if you want to go ham. There is even a harpoon gun if you get the Hurk DLC, it can pin enemies to walls and send them flying off cliffs.  The characters in this game are amazing. Hurk is my favorite character, I feel like whenever I see him the 'America, ♥♥♥♥ Yeah' song from Team America: World Police should be playing. He is a badass dude and is pretty funny, you get to do missions with him in his DLC and can adventure with him in Co-op. (Player 2 is Hurk) Rabi Ray Rana is really funny, he just blabbers on for like 5 minutes every time you take a mission from him. The stuff he says is pretty funny, he talks about bidets and his pet... something. Pagan Min is a great antagonist, he calls you on your walkie talkie all the time just to have a nice little chat with you, and he REALLY wants you to eat crab rangoons.  All in all, I give this game a 10/10, I have played through it twice. It is one of the best games I have ever played and I get so much enjoyment out of it. In all my time playing I still get those moments where I do something badass that I haven't ever done before and I just sit there with my mouth wide open for a minute and then I have to call one of my friends up and try (and fail) to explain how awesome it was. I always wish that I recorded my playthroughs.  Thank you for reading my rather long review, I hope it helps you decide to buy the game. Totally worth all the time you will put in.

It's like a free open world for 2 players and it's surely fun. I just wish Far Cry 3 had that instead of adding new missions for co-op and not letting us roam around the map and do whatever we want.

I see its potential, but as it stands now it's not worth the price of admission.  What kills me is that many of these problems are obvious if this game had any semi-rigorous beta test: Key binding failure, lock-ups on loading, doesn't play nice with certain USB peripherals. These problems presented themselves to the public as soon as the software was unlocked. Why weren't they noticed at testing? Were they only testing the console editions and skipped the PC?  Immediate and catastrophic failure of the software generally means there was a failure at the business level too. Ubisoft has failed it's customer base again with this failed launch and the problems with their Assasin's Creed: Unity fiasco. This title was clearly rushed, and possibly skipped beta testing, to meet an arbitrary market date. Based on what I've seen in the forums here and at Ubisoft, their lack of responsiveness and clear hostility towards making a good product, I highly recommend waiting to purchase this, and any other Ubisoft title, until it's market proven and on deep discount.",

What makes the game essentially unplayable at the moment is the inability to save when you want to and the tendancy of the game to not restore checkpoints on reloads. This means you are replaying the same bits over and over for no reason.  Worse is the complete stuffup on keyboard movement. There is simply no way to step backwards (seriously Uplay, seriously?) and other keys just plain don't work which leaves you stuck on ropes with no way to go up or down.

As sequels go, the motto 'If it ain't broke, don't try to fix it' seems to work here. Great game, but no replay value. Co-op is fun, although it is limited to freeroaming and side quests.",

            "review_text": "Is it a reskinned Far Cry 3? Sort of. Is it repetitve? Certianly. All the Far Cry games contain the same basic principles, capture bases, kill bad guys, topple dictatorships, craft items, spend skill points, buy weapons. Those complaining that it's Far Cry 3 in a different biome obviously don't understand that is another installment in the FAR CRY series. It's going to be similar.   This go around the graphics are even better, and the optimization is good as well. This game runs very nicely on my FX-8350/ GTX 770 machine, almost max settings except for AA. Gameplay is good, story is not quite as interesting as FC3, although your character is less annoying. After only playing for 12 hours, I can tell you that the DUNIA engine is impressive as far as how it runs. You don't need a monstrously overpowered PC to sludge through poorly optimized code. Any quad-core and a GTX 750 should be fine.   My only gripe I have is that the animals drive me crazy. Seriously, It's even worse than FC3. Eagles come out of knowhere and attack you from the sky... CONSTANTLY. Iv'e experienced a few minor glitches here and there, but overall it's a very well polished, good looking, good running game. I suppose it is basically more of the same, but I would still highly recommend if you are a fan of FC2 and FC3.",

The gameplay does have quite a similar likeness to the previous game. But it looks and feels different. The weaponry is very bold and even looks, sounds, and feels good. The missions are very unique and are not even remotely similar to others. The characters are very real and each have a personality of their own. (Except for the usual infantry/rebels) I also absolutely love the new addon's in FC4, such as the special weaponry, mini heli, riding elephants, etc. Overall this game gets a 8.6/10and is easily worth the $49.99",

            "review_text": "This remarkable game has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. The purpose of THIS review is to give me an opportunity to organize my own thoughts about it. I have played all Far Cry games on PC (Far Cry and Far Cry 2, multiple times. And don’t forget the awesome Far Cry: Blood Dragon). Far Cry 4 is very similar in concept to Far Cry 3 – both very large open world games in which the protagonist, (unskilled, inexperienced, unequipped) struggles against the brutal tyranny of a charming psychopath. Although I enjoyed Far Cry 3 from beginning to end, Far Cry 4 got off to a very rocky start for me. But first the good stuff.  The implementation of stealth is very well done in this game. I say this after just finishing Crysis 3 in which there was no stealth. In Crysis 3, if you weren’t cloaked while crouched and peeking around a corner, you would be instantly fired upon by soldiers or aliens a half mile away. Ridiculous! Not so in Far Cry 4. And you really need to be stealthy in Far Cry 4. The good news is that stealthy behavior pays off a lot. Don’t need no freaking nano suit.  Elephants. One of the most fun elements of the game, riding elephants. You have to pay for this as a skill. So, work up to it. Elephants are a very safe and practical way to move across the map. Encounter an enemy patrol, no problem. Run the elephant into them and melee with the elephant’s trunk. You can destroy oncoming enemy vehicles head on. Loads of fun. Elephants also provide great protection against the multitudes of predators that menace the landscape. And even while dismounted, nearby elephants act on your behalf with close encounters involving harassments by enemies.  Shangri-La missions. Although the main story is fine, I especially enjoyed the five missions to Shangri-La. I hadn’t read about the game beforehand and I was very surprised by these missions. I especially appreciated the expose’ and enactment of the battle to wrest control over Shangri-La from the forces of evil. I was joined by a svelte ally for most of the missions. Arena style battles here and very, very challenging. Yet beautiful and enchanting.  Ghale Homstead. Reminded me of the Hearthfire DLC in Skyrim. You need to find this location, and it takes some doing to get there. Once established, you can pay for upgrades. One of the best upgrades is the option to purchase a buzzer – little gyrocopter. Buzzers are awesome ways to travel and scout out unexplored territory, but they are hard to find as just random drops. But once you own one, just fast travel to the Ghale homestead and climb in.  DJ Rabi Ray Rana. I really enjoyed the mindless chatter coming out of the radios. I know some players hated this guy, but I loved him. He injected some interesting and positive energy in what was otherwise a dreary and hopeless existence. Most of all, I loved the music that accompanied his show. I am still looking for a playlist of his music.  Weapons. As always, there are amazing weapons choices, but (as always) you have to build up to them. My favorite sidearm was the Auto-Cross. This is an automatic mini-crossbow. It is a silent one-shot killer and it is indispensable in the times before acquiring a silenced sniper rifle. I loved this thing and I never stopped carrying it. Still carried my bow, but for long-distance silent kills, the Auto-Cross excelled.  Grappling hook. It was awesome. Easy to use (after some practice). Never glitched.  Lore. The game takes place in Kyrat, a fictional country nestled between India and the Himalayan Mountains. The game’s setting is filled with ancient lore and beautiful traditional art from the region – paintings, statues of hindu deities, and shrines. The value and importance of the region’s beliefs and heritage becomes a critical consideration later in the game. I chose to preserve it.  Ethnic origins. It was pretty obvious that the Adherents and soldiers of the Golden Path were of Indian (or thereabouts) descent and the Royal Army was of Chinese origin. Accents and even expressions in native tongues revealed this difference. Somewhat mirroring the ongoing struggle in Nepal between natives of Tibet and Chinese from the north.  Noore’s Arena. Meh. Hunger Games style battles with supporters tossing in resources for you. The public address commentary is sensational and perfectly captures the depraved sentiment of the event. But after a few rounds, the arena becomes a grind to unlock weapons. You make a little money but not much. In order to unlock the much coveted Bushman silenced assault rifle, you need to achieve level 10 in the arena. I chose not to. It would be hours of formulaic running, gunning and healing. Not for me.  Now, some of the problems I had with the game. Let’s start with the main quest. In a word, fragmented. On reflection after finishing the game, the main quest seemed uncohesive, not pulled together. It kinda just went… “wherever.” For example, it seemed that after completing a main quest challenge, then afterwards for a time, there was nothing. No more challenges, no place to go. I suppose this “down time” might have been intended to give me a chance to explore the vast map, but I just felt a little too much set adrift. Then suddenly a new main quest challenge would pop up on the map. I eventually got used to this and it was fine. But overall, the story and action did not naturally cohere. It’s like reading a book and finishing a chapter. Then turn the page and there’s nothing but a blank page and several more after that. Then after a few more blank pages, you discover the next chapter.  Here is an example. As you might expect, there was the obligatory betrayal and imprisonment episode. Not surprising. But after the escape (which was a big ordeal and a really hard challenge), there was nothing. No response or comment by the antagonist. No, “I’ll get you for escaping my prison!” One day I was in his prison. The next I was out. And life just went on as if it had never happened. Lame.  Flying and falling glitches. One of the iconic activities of Far Cry games are the hang gliders. But I was conditioned to stop using them in Far Cry 4. Often I would just die immediately after deployment. I mean instantly. No collision, just falling and death. Wingsuit too. Jump off a cliff and hit the control to deploy the wingsuit (Shift key in my case) and nothing. No wingsuit just falling and death. The only device that worked reliably was the parachute. They really screwed up this joyful mechanic in this game.  Dogs. In some regions, the landscape is “hounded” by packs and packs of wild dogs. To the extent that it becomes boorish. Each pack has four or five and each dog takes nearly a full clip from an assault rifle to kill. There is just no way to walk terrain in these areas. Always need a jeep or an elephant. Which sucked because I prefer to walk most of the time. Thankfully, most regions don’t have dogs but they were present in enough places to give me a sad. In the S.T.A.L.K.E.R, games there were dogs too, but one headshot would kill them, and THEY were mutated super dogs. So, the implementation of wild dogs in Far Cry 4 was dumb.  Overall and despite some minor complaints, Far Cry 4 matched and in some cases exceeded its predecessors. The landscape is the most beautiful I can remember playing on. The bot AI was masterful. The choices I have as a player are enormous. Stealth, grappling hook, Auto Cross, elephants, buzzer, Shangri-La and I almost forgot, Yogi and Reggie help make this game very worthwhile. ",

Firstly, I'm not experiencing black screens, which I know many are, but I still find that this game is unplayable, so even if they do fix the black screens, the people that are experiencing them won't be very happy once they do. Secondly, considering how hard this game seems to drive, you would expect it to have the best graphics on Earth, you would however be wrong. This game looks absolutely miserable, the light reflects off of nothing and just appears wherever it feels necessary, the people are blurry if you stand 5 feet away from them and have massive ugly blue outlines, and the textures are blurry, flickery, and stretched.  I am running sli 780's, 1,000 ♥♥♥♥ing dollars of graphics cards, and can't even maintain 60 frames when in a village, seriously? Are you ♥♥♥♥ing kidding me? The reccomended is a 680, last gen card, now 2 gens old, and two cards that are above it can't even run it properly. When I am not in the villages, I can push 60+ very easily, however, this comes with one major drawback, the drawback being the constant flickering, dips, and stuttering.   Another problem I encountered, on top of the game looking awful, was the fact that If I just so happen to hit escape to do anything, whether it be to change graphics or audio, the game will leave a frozen image of what I last saw on my screen with a lower opacity. So say that I was looking at an elephant and then hit esc, then I returned to the game and looked at a mountain, the picture of the elephant would still be there, just more transparent. The only way to fix this is to restart the game and pray to god that you never end up hitting esc.  Finally, the gameplay and level design. Your character feels heavy and held back. He's almost difficult to control and attempting to aim and shoot is nearly impossible. It feels like a cheap knock off of Farcry 3. The level design is much more linear due to the fact that you can't climb whatever mountain you want, and all the cool things are just distant static images. This game could honestly be the next Five Nights at Freddies, you know, you bring your friends over and have them play it for a few minutes, and then they want to kill themselves, the only difference being that FNAF, was actually trying to accomplish this.  Do not buy this game, it is a joke. If you liked farcry 3, do not buy this game because of that, they are very different.",

I ran Far Cry 3 on a gtx 670 without problems. This one I have to use two to get the same kind of performance but the graphics are not that much better. In fact some of the new bells and whistles looks downright ugly and imbalanced, like the godrays system.

            "review_text": "If you liked Far Cry 3, go for it! The game really feels like an updated version of the 3rd installment, which as a whole isn't a bad thing.   Pros 1) Stunning scenery...part of the reason I loved the Far Cry 3 is the huge, beautiful world you're put into. If anything, they surpassed my expectations; Far Cry 4 has a variety of different environments depending on where you are on the map.  Graphics as a whole look great as well.  2) Core gameplay very similar to Far Cry 3 - definitely a good thing! What's more, they've included small improvements such as auto-crafting health syringes, marking downed animals on the mini map, an auto-drive feature, and other cool features. Even the UI has been improved.  3) The wildlife is much more engaging. So far I'm in the first area and I feel that the wildlife really adds a level of challenge to the mix. Hoping to see more of that going forward...not too much more though.  Cons 1) It almost feels a little too similar to the 3rd one sometimes. Looking at the skill tree, there's not too many new skills. The good part is they've kept most, if not all the skills from the last game, so if you liked the skill tree, then it can kind of be viewed as a good thing. When all is said and done though, I can't help but think that they could of added a little more variety.  2) This is kind of a personal gripe, but as much as I enjoy the wildlife encounters in the game so far, I have to say the eagle has to be one of the most obnoxious enemies in the game to date. This might just be bad luck or the areas I've been in, but I get attacked constantly by these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ed birds. Part of the problem is melee doesn't seem to work on them (please someone correct me if I'm wrong) - whenever they get 10 to 15 metres from your character, he automatically goes into a defense animation, making you unable to do anything but watch your lifebar get drained. And the animation doesn't wound the bird - in fact, most of the time the eagle will fly away, and then come back to attack you, moments after you've fended him off. I know it seems like a silly gripe, but when you're surveying an outpost or something requiring stealth and these birds attack, you can't exactly start shooting in the sky like a madman. To make matters worse, the bird doesn't even give out anything useful, just some garbage feathers. I'm not even sure why they included this enemy in the game, I'm no eagle expert but last I checked, birds generally don't attack people unless you're after their eggs or something.   EDIT: After another 7 hours of playing and I've only been attacked once! That's not to say I haven't seen any eagles.. I've seen plenty I assure you, they just seem to find the NPCs before they find me. I guess it was just bad luck in the end that I was getting attacked constantly. Still, the amount of times I hear a member of the Golden Path scream 'Watch out! An Eagle!' is mind-blowing.  3) I've heard a lot of negativity about the story in previous reviews. I can't comment too much on that given how far I've gotten, but so far it's alright. Not great, but not bad. If the game is fun (which it is), I tend to kind of look past issues with the main storyline. Honestly with all the side quests and junk to do, you tend to forget the story bit sometimes. At least I do.  Closing Comments If I had to go back, I'd probably wait for a sale to buy it (or maybe not, I'm kind of impatient), but it's still a great game so far. If you like Far Cry 3 or have never tried it, you'll be sure to enjoy it. If you didn't like Far Cry 3, avoid this game as the core gameplay is essentially identical.  5/7 IF PUT IN A SIMILAR POSITION, I WOULD PROBABLY STILL BUY THE GAME",

The sidequests are great fun and (in my opinion) stealth in gernal. You get more chances to use stealth. But there's also a bad part. I don't like it personaly..you can't realy do stealth at the begining of the game because of the bad weapons and missing skills for it and the story is a bit confusing. I found around 5 bugs/glitches in game, wich is kinda sad. The price is a bit high especially if you buy it in the gold edition like I did. :D I didn't play Multiplayer/Coop yet. 6/10 stars   Compared to FC3:  Sure you got this ton of new stuff like a crossbow and the stuff I wrote down in the normal review and this great graphic ,more fun in sidequests ,but It's just in my opnion..I don't like the story. In my opinion fc3 was a better game...better story doesn't just make a better game I know ,but I just had that great feeling in fc3 the whole time I played it through. I also just wanted to continue playing fc3 ,because of the great story. It feels more like the whole game fc4 builds on the sidequests and that's in my opinion a bit wrong.   So If you wanna play stealth ,action and a great open world game ,grab fc4. If you are more up for the story ,you should at least try it.  (small spoiler at the end) Willis comes back to fc4.  Thought: I think the next far cry will play in Russia or something like that ,because Willis was at Rook Island first and gets to Kyrat and he said in fc3 that he's on his way to Russia and will have to get some fuel near Singapure.  One last thing: Sorry for my bad english I'm not a native.",

At first I had medium expectations for it but they went up. Not a lot but a fair bit. Overally I am happy with the game and will continue to play it for a long time. I looked at some reviews and I saw some people saying that FarCry 4 is just a copy and paste game of FarCry 3, but with a diffrent story. So if you want a better story the get FarCry 3. If you have played FarCry 3 then you might be disappointed with FarCry 4. But if your a new player to the FarCry Series then you should get it.

I was nine years old when it happened, I remember it as if it were yesterday. There I was, in an urban outfitters, browsing for some cargo shorts, wool socks and sandals, when I saw it. It was the most elegant piece of attire I had ever laid eyes on. The seconds that followed slip my memory entirely, however the moment it graced my head, would be a moment that I never forget.

While some aspects of this game are identical to its predecessor, this beast also has many new additions and features which allow it to stand out as its own game. Karma events, hostage rescue, re-playable outposts to continuously practice your assault skills on. The best thing that was added though, in my opinion, is how your choices affect the game down the road. Choose option A, this happens. Choose option B, that happens. Either option opens, or closes, new missions and storylines.

Then I got it, and I haven't even been able to play it because my PC can't handle it. I understand that Ubisoft partnered with Nvidia on this one, but by a lot of things that I have read, those are really the only graphic cards that can handle the game. And I think that is unfair to the community that is so loyal and such a big fan of the series, like myself. Now, I don't have anything fancy when it comes to my PC. I don't have a PC particularly made for PC because I can't afford it at this point in my life, but I would galdy spend money on the next game in the series because in the past I have played the previous game soo much. I don't have money for a next gen console so I can't go that route, and the only other route I could go is getting it for the Xbox 360, but I got both Far Cry 3 on the xbox 360 and PC and my PC handled it perfectly and the graphics were better on my PC. And I also thought that if developers make a game for the Xbox 360, then my PC should be able to handle it, even on all the lowest possible settings. But it can't. Even with all the graphics on low and my wonder being a 800 x 600 screen, it still is unplayable. Even with Far Cry 2 graphics for 4, it is unplayable. If you don't have a gaming PC, but your PC can handle most games, don't get this game at this point in time because you won't be able to play it. I have waited for this game for as long as I can remember, and I pre order it and pre download it and get the Gold Edition and then when I try to play it, my PC can barely run it. Thanks for getting my hopes up Ubisoft. Please fix this. I understand that you ported this game to PC, but think of the players on PC that don't have the best graphic cards. Cut them some slack and help them be able to play it because they put money aside, even though all of it should be going to college, to get your game.",

The campagin is short as well, your choices don't affect the course of the game as much as in Far Cry 3. BUT: that were the negative points! Now for the positive aspects of the game. First, the world is HUGE and vivid. There's lots of exploration to do, the wildlife is fantastic, the gunplay extremely well done. You have SO MUCH to do!

Far Cry 3 and Blood Dragon were both surprise personal favs that I played to death on the 360, so I was excited for 4. Sadly, it ended up being a total slog that I could only tolerate for a couple hours at a time.   There are so many little annoyances that build up over time. Predatory wildlife is hyper-aggressive and always seems to come out of nowhere. Enemies can shoot the wings off a fly at hundreds of yards. Stealth is less effective, and your thrown rocks are almost always ignored by all but one or two guards. Healing animations are somehow slower than 3, so enjoy crouching in a corner and watching them over and over and over again. The story is even less engaging than 3's, largely because you only see the villain a few times in-game before he's regulated to the boring task of talking your ear off via your radio. Performance is awful, too - just check out the multiple reports of random stuttering on systems that are more than capable.   It's not total unrepentant garbage. There are some moments of brilliance in the rare times where everything works right together. But they're so few and far between in such a long game.",

Much like Just Cause, this game isn't driven by plot, but simple, fun gameplay in an open world full of collectibles.   The plot line itself only takes a few hours, if that (it took me 35 hours, but that includes finishing all of the side missions on top of the plot missions, and doing a fair amount of the collectibles. Maybe another 5-10 hours to get them all). Infact, the plot is probably the worst part of the game. The antagonist, is probably the most likable character and surely the most innocent in comparison to everyone else. You're forced to choose between two arbitrary choices; in order to continue the plot, you have to choose between feeding children to lions, and feeding them to leopards. Make similar decisions 5 or 6 times, with repetitive shooting gallery segments inbetween each, and you have Farcry 4.  What the game exceeds at, is what JC2 exceeded at, a game you can simply shut your brain off and relax while collecting things.  Recommended for the sale price, I had plenty of fun with it for £7.50, I'd struggle to justify paying any more for it, however.",

A ridicilous story, unintuitive controls, crappy gameplay mechanics, forgetful multiplayer, moronic AI and huge amounts of sloppy game design choices cannot be compensated by beautiful graphics and massive scale. It is clear that this game tries to sell itself by its big shiny surface but it can't hide the fact that I feel like there is no serious craftmanship at all behind its development.  Far Cry 4 uses cheap mechanics similar to other Ubisoft games, or even mobile games, to try and keep you hooked, but in the end the boredom and frustration is just too big to keep me interested.   After really trying to like the game and spending time with it I feel it was a complete waste of time because Far Cry 4 has no value other than its beautiful graphics. No memorable story, art design, character, music, mechanic or anything whatsoever. More a tech demo than a game, with mechanics and ideas from other games slapped onto it to hide the fact that no thought went into polishing a thoughtful product.   Not that I always crave a deep story or pretentious art design, I enjoy a mindless shooter or action game as much as anyone. But this game simply feels cheap in every department and there are a ton of games that offer a lot more value for your precious time, open-world or not.   There are a lot of areas where Far Cry 4 shows a lot of promise and with proper care it could've been an amazing game. But as it stands the shortcomings are far too many. I'm usually forgiving with open-world games for lacking some polish or not excelling at everything but Far Cry 4 simply crossed the line for what I find tolerable. I want to invest my money and time in games I don't regret playing. Far Cry 4 isn't one of them.   Graphics 9/10, Story 3/10, Gameplay 4/10 Overall: 4/10",

First off, Far Cry 4 I guess is similar to Far Cry 3, but keep in mind its the next ♥♥♥♥ing game in the series, Far Cry 3 was absolutely amazing, so it would make sense to make them similar. People dont look past the fact that the crafting is the same and that its just the same story. Its not the same, this game is amazing and is so much more than what these ♥♥♥♥bags say. This game has tons of freeroam content and has a decently large story to it. Not to mention the fact that there is so much stuff to buy, at first it doesn't seem like much, but as the story progresses it adds more powerful guns to the trading post. A personal favorite of mine is the amount of signatures and how the signatures actually cost money. All around this game is worth the money and has excellent gameplay. A side note about the story, Ubisoft implemented Balance of Power missions, which basically let you choose what you want to do and, at first, really has no impact on the game. But as more Balance of Power missions go by you can really see the difference and I actually had a hard time choosing what side to pick, I felt like I was actually making a difficult decision and that it took me a minute to decide what to do, even then I would sometimes second guess my choices.  To conclude 1. NOT THE SAME ♥♥♥♥ING GAME AS FAR CRY 3 2. Plenty of things to do after completing the story mode 3. Balance of Power missions are wonderful BAD STUFF 1. Not many complaints, some glitches my friend experience with crafting (didn't happen to me, No glitches so far for me actually) 2, FOV slider seems to literally make no differnce 3.

Since I figured it was another poor console port like Farcry 3, I kept my controller plugged in from finishing the last one. After the first cutscene, game immediately messed up. NPCs all frozen. Googled it and found that the controller caused mission-breaking hangs. Restarted with it unplugged and made it through the first block. Immediately after going outside, you have to kinda get in this truck. Did that, game didn't recognize it. Second mission hang. Weirdly, after a combination of pausing, unpausing and checking my weapons it mysteriously started working again. Made it another two hours before I met Longinus, in which the cutscene freaked so bad it actually spun me around and I was staring at trees while he talked. After a seemingly endless monologue, the mission started and I was teleported inside of his house which was now empty except for floating guns. Also could not leave. Tried reloading but this terrible system autosaved me inside of the broken house. My save is now essentially useless, and I'll have to replay the two hours and hope that it doesn't happen again.  That being said, it's pretty much a better looking FC3 as others have said, albeit with *slightly* less wonky controls. I hate uplay, I hate ubisoft, and I hope the analysts who worked on the campaign missions get butt pimples and smelly feet.",

There are things that far cry 4 changes from its predecessor BETTER and things it does worse.   I originally started typing this review out with a long list of my shared experiences, but there really is too many to list. Simply put: if you wanna play on easy, avoid stealth, and primarily use shotguns and machine guns, then you will benefit from all the included features that have been added since the previous far cry title. However, if you choose to up the gameplay or use stealth weapons or mechanics, the game will typically not use these new features in your favor.  In isolated instances, when you're given a chance to observe an area and take on a known encounter, the game is really fun, however, there are often too many unpredictable factors, enemies, events, animations, landscape or AI glitches, or weapon malfunctions that will typically ruin your experience.  If you wanna try it, be mindful of steam's 2 hours of gameplay refund policy. Most of the 'bull' that ruined this game for me, only showed up after the 6 hour mark. I've played every far cry title, and even played the original far cry 1 disk SET before I created my steam account, and I personally think that Ubisoft has murdered this franchise.",

Characters movements are absolutely real, as well as face motion but, not only in main characters or just people, animals move as the real thing. Incredible!.  The world map is huge, variate and interesting enough. Everything is alive and, random. You can be trying to get a post and then, several wild animals attack you; if you shoot them, you discover your position. ha ha ha. You should see how an eagle gets a goat or any other animal, how rinos charge against your car, etc. Awesome!.  Respect of FC3, a few more weapons, vehicles and, everything together was added.  There are some psicodelic missions and, some interesting new side quests or missions. Missions on the snow and ice are specially good and, the escape from the prision is apotheosic (I've even seen the Yeti !!!).  The game delivers lots of playing hours and, scenarios are so good that it's funny to explore the whole map. High re-playability and, the possibility to play it in cooperative mode (campaign). It has also some Multiplayer online game modes, which I didn't test so, I have no opinion, yet.  In the bad side, I could only say that to understand how to continue the main plot(s) takes a while and that, there are so many key assignments. IMHO, the interface could be reduced a lot to fewer keys, to make it easier to control your character / vehicles / weapons.  Ok. Ubisoft failed delivering a game that hung if you had any USB device plugged (fixed with patch 1.4.0), what made angry to most of players, which were expecting the release date to death. This included myself, as well. But, the amount of effort behind this game is colossal. Another great work from Ubisoft Montreal, a joy of game programming. It worths the money.",

Also, yes I have tried the duel core fix for the game but so far in spite of me following the directions of all the videos I haved watched on this fix perfectly, resulted in me once again failing to fix the game. The injector that comes with the download for the fix has proven to be none other than a useless program taking up space on my computer. Before buying this game I would check my specs first just to make sure I didn't have a duel core CPU. I do not recommend even considering buying this game if your processor is any less than a quad core. If I were you I would definetely wait for Ubisoft to come up with an actual fix for this, but even then I dont think the game is worth $50 anyways and now since I waisted 18 hours of my time trying to fix this, I am no longer eligable to get a refund for the game.
