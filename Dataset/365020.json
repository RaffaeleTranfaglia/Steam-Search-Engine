            "review_text": "Gynophobia is a terrible terrible game and you should all stay away as far away as possible.  Gynophobia is described as an abnormal fear of women and guess what ? That's what the main character has, he also has an abnormal fear of spiders, but calling the game Arachnophobia probably didn't sound right. Well anyways, the main character sees a woman through his door and flips out and is sent to a nightmarish world where he is attacked by demon women and spiders.  The game is split into three segments. The first is you exploring the apartment of the main character. The game at first lock you out of fully exploring with a spider which you are too deeply scared to even squish. Then there's a computer game segment where you are at first trying to leave a sewer and then you have to look for parts to fix up a van while a huge guy with a hammer (which you can't kill chases you). The third segment is the before mentioned nightmare world where you fight women and spiders and it all leads up to a boss fight of spider lady.  The graphics are terrible. It sort of feels like slapped together assets since a lot of the spider models are what you see in other indie titles that contain them. In general this game looks bad.  Music and sound effects are also absolutely terrible. There's nothing good about them as they cut out most of the time. The guns sound like toy weapons and the grunts of the zombies sound terrible.  The game is incredibly short, I'm talking about 30 minutes short. Each segment takes around 15 minutes each and after that there's no replay value whatsoever.  The gunplay itself is not very good. The hit detection is really really bad. Even when shooting dead center the headshots won't connect.   Overall Gynophobia is a really bad game and I see nothing redeeming about it. I feel like I wasted the 1.30 euro on it, but what's done is done, but I do however can warn people to stay away from this game.  Final Rating:  1/10  Pros: N/A  Cons: - Terrible Graphics - Hit Detection is horrible - 30 minutes to complete the entire thing ",

The first minutes of gameplay gave me an eerie, spooky feeling and actually made me jumpscare. The difficulty of it impressed me and made me retry over and over until I finally got the hang of it. When I reached the first bossfight I actually felt the chills down my spine and enjoyed the horror.  This might not be Amnesia, but for a lowbudget-game I found it really enjoyable and can recommend it to anyone who isn't too demaning on the graphics. It is although the gameplay itself that is the most important thing, and let's face it. Who does'nt want a game about gynophobia :P  PS. it helps if you've downed a couple of beers before you play this.  Cheers and enjoy!",

(really no shotgun magnum sniper rifle grenades?)  2: NO FREAKING DIFFICULTY, THE GAME WAS KINDA FREAKING HARD, IT NEEDS A DIFFICULTY MODE EASY NORMAL HARD MODE!!!!  okay other than that the game got boring and only had 2 stages!!! But it was fun when not getting murdered!!!  so score wise 70/100 i do recommend this game!",
