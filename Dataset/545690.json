I still loved it. Don't think I've played any puzzle game like it, it's tidy and pretty, calm and cathartic, a zen garden of overlapping shapes, solving it made me smile each time.  Make more. And with the achievements working this time. Make more and I'll buy it. Promise.  The music's particularly nice too.",
