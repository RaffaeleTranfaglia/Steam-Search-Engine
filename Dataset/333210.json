            "review_text": "TLDR: Surprisingly deep game for strategy gamers. Good solid fun for casual gamers, especially ones who love being bad guys.  Having spent so many hours playing this game, I felt like it was about time I wrote a review.  I'm always interested in games which you can play from the 'opposite point of view'. Games like Evil Genius, or Stubbs the Zombie, or Dungeon Keeper, where you can take on the role of the traditional 'bad guy'.  This game lets you take control of a city wrecking Kaiju in your bid to take over the world. Some people have made the comparison to the old school arcade classic Rampage, but this game is so much more intricate and has so much more depth. It's hard to compare it to anything else I can think of. It has base building elements, character development as you power up your Kaiju, strategy at a city level and global level. Resource management. Although you could play it as a casual city stomping experience, if you invest more time and attention in the game, you will come to appreciate the depth here.  At a secret base level, you have to juggle your resources and facilities, making raids to gather all the money and power and organics to maintain your base and build new facilities. You will have a couple of years to build up your base and Kaiju powers before the Kaiju Defence Force (KDF) begin to attack your secret base directly. But when they do, you'd better have some defences in place because even their first attacks can send enough units to wreck your base and overwhelm your Kaiju.  At a global level, there are many cities rated from Tier 1 (weak) to Tier 5 (strong), and spread across 6 global regions. Each attack on a city will raise the alert level of a region, from green to yellow to amber to red. It's much easier to catch a city off guard in a region with a low alert level, and the alert level will drop over time if you don't keep attacking the same region. On the other hand, you can capture cities faster with repeated attacks, but doing so will leave a region on Red Alert level, which I've never seen drop back down to amber, even after several in game months. Attacking cities which are on alert makes your raid much tougher as there will be more units on the map to greet you. Catching a city off guard will give you some time to stomp around without any enemies to oppose you. That can make a big difference.  The only way to force a city to surrender without plunging the whole region to red alert is to hit it when the region is on green alert, completely unprepared, and make it surrender with one attack. That adds a level of strategy. If you have no regions on green alert, do you risk a raid and force that region to an even higher alert level, or take a break, maybe spend some time training new abilities until the regions calm down again? Or do you just attack relentlessly and pay no heed to the alert levels, risking being ambushed when you arrive at a city, or facing a lot of enemy units as soon as you arrive, instead of catching them by surprise and having some time to wreck whatever you wish without having to fight off the defence forces?  At a city level, each city has its own character. The developers have made each city look like it should with the building styles and map layout, and each city has a different selection of units to protect it. Some rely more on helicopters and aircraft, some have more tanks, or hi tech units, some use lighter long ranged units like missile trucks and missile tanks. Each kind of enemy unit requires a different kind of Kaiju power to counter. And with only 6 power slots available, picking the right abilities for each city is important. No point taking normal Eye Beam Lasers when you know you're going to be facing tanks. You'll need Radioactive Death Stare for those. But then again, if you're only going to be facing jeeps and light tanks, normal Eye Beams are much more useful, they cost less power to use, and have a much quicker recharge time. No need for overkill, always picking the most powerful abilities you have.  Also, each city has a different balance of available resources. Some cities might have many colleges and universities, making it a great place to raid for Knowledge. Others might have several banks or large office building areas, great for looting cash. Some have extensive dock and port areas, where you can get plenty of energy. Some cities might not have many buildings where you can get power, so you'll have to make sure you head out with plenty of power already in your Kaijus batteries. Others might have so many power buildings that you can afford to go there running on empty, so you can bring back to base a huge amount of power for building better facilities.  Either way, even though you have a massive monster under your control, you will inevitably be overwhelmed and forced to retreat as the defenders send more and more units against you. So you have to hit a city hard, grab what you need, destroy your chosen targets and get out again safely. Do you want to force the city to surrender and supply you with monthly cash income? Take out their landmarks and stomp on as many civilians as you can. Are you just making a raid for cash, or power, or knowledge? Find the buildings that contain what you need, and smash them to the ground to get at the goodies inside. Banks, Universities, Power Plants, Office Towers... they all give up more loot than simple houses and stores.  You can definitely play this as a casual stress relief kind of game, having fun stomping on fleeing citizens and infantry, swatting helicopters out of the sky and melting tanks with laser beams and plasma breath, but for players who love deeper strategy and unique or unusual gameplay, this game really has a lot to offer.  And with the upcoming release of two more Kaiju, with different abilities and features, it has more to offer in the future. I can understand why some players are disappointed that all three monsters weren't available at launch, but the develpers have been toiling hard behind the scenes, as well as polishing the game as it stands with tweaks, bug hunts and game balancing. Over 200 hours with only one Kaiju, and two more to look forward to. I didn't play Skyrim or Fallout 3 as much as I've played this, and those two games are definitely on my top 5 list of most awesome games.",

            "review_text": "Fun game, brings back great memories of playing Rampage in the arcade or the classice 1986 Movie Mosters on the C64. Nice blend of resource/building sim and arcade 2.5D monster city destroyer. Graphics are cartoony and work well, looks like something you would be playing on your SNES. Game play is easy and works well with mouse and hotkeys, not sure if controller support or not as I didn't attempt to use one.   As of right now you get to choose 3 kaiju/scientists to use, each with their own attributes and powers/skills which you purchase and train for your kaiju. Training is done with a training center you have to build for each tier of skills, lending a skill tree for each basic skill enhancing them or adding new skills. Your secret base consists of energy, biotics and knowledge generators which you build to power and build new buildings for more energy,biotics and knowledge. Building and managing your base is fairly easy to get the hang of and a summary screen lets you know monthly costs and output. Destroying a cities moral below 40 will cause it to surrender to you which pays you money every month as a don't destroy us please tax. Allthough I've had a city to 20 and they stubbornly held out til I left so it isn't an exact number to go by.   Fun game to play for 20 mins or a few hours, I have around 50+ hours online and offline so far and still playing and enjoying it. Thanks to the devs for creating a game which brought back some classic ideas and worked them into a great game. And they used Kaiju in the name!",

I also think this game would make a great animated movie.  I once saw a boat sail across land and into the water. It confused me. I went to attack Tokyo with tier 1 upgrades so I could relive all those Kaiju moments. Turns out, I got mutilated by stasis tanks. I also had a major energy crisis until I got the Fusion Plant. Energy is the most painful thing to obtain until then.",

            "review_text": "Good fun for the first couple of hours, but once you've tired of attacking the same cities with the same incremental improvement each time it's clear just how shallow this game really is.  I also have to question just how fair the game is to the player when your secret base is eventually discovered and attacked. Even when cheating in an attempt to squeeze more replayability from this game (by giving myself infinite resources) I was shocked to find my top-tier base defences completely overwhelmed at the first sign of trouble.   And unless you're saving regularly and have a point to go back to before your base was discovered: loss of base = game over. Start the arduous process of attacking and researching all over again. Only this time you will see the grind coming.  The controls are incredibly janky, NO MONSTER DON'T SQUISH THAT, RUN THERE!, as is the time accelerate feature, which will force you to increase the speed of time every time an insignificant building is created. This may not sound like an issue. But after your 100th wall piece is finished building you're pretty sick of having to press the speed up time button just to see the next wall finish.  I suspect that the late-game content of having your base investigated and thrashed is tied entirely to your kaiju's tech level. Which, if it is the case, is really lazy programming. Why not have the response of the civilized world grow proportionate to the amount of damage you do? As the game stands, upsetting one continent is the same as upsetting 5 continents in terms of armed response, so why would you care to focus your attacks?  I totally agree with the people appraising this as a mobile game come to PC. The only thing missing is micro-transactions to speed up the monotony.  If the devs make a sequel and learn from this one then it would be worth picking up. This game, unfortunately isn't.",

On the Plus side, they are patching quickly (the game breaking lag/fps drops are mostly fixed) so, 'yay' I guess.  The core concept is great - I like the base management side, even in its place holder form (it is in no way functional, with key features poorly working at best, but mostly missing entirely) - I like the presentation, art style, music etc - I LOVE the stomping of cities bit - when they haven't broken the enemy scaling so you get vapourised before the game even gives you control of your Kaiju.  I think in 3 or 4 months time, I'll be able to give this a recommendation - but right now, its an unplayable mess while they try to finish it.",

            "review_text": "This game is great, but it's also a game that has a lot of flaws. What makes it work is that it possesses that undeniable 'fun factor' that keeps you coming back despite those flaws. The strategy layer plays like a single-base xcom while the tactical layer (city stomping) plays out like an ARPG. The city stomping starts out as really fun, descends into monotony as you realize how everything works, and then becomes extremely satisfying once you get the truly fun kaiju abilities later in the game.   On that note, watching entire city blocks being decimated by fiery/nuclear/.etc destruction just doesn't seem to get old, especially if you've been to the cities you're destroying; that is to say, the cities are modeled extremely well after their real life counterparts. The myriad of ways each Kaiju can accomplish this destruction keeps me coming back and replaying the game.  Regarding the ARPG-like gameplay, your kaiju is given 5 to 7 ability slots for you to populate. These abilities range from completely worthless to outright broken (read: extremely fun to abuse). The abilities themselves are broken up into three categories: attack, defense, and metabolism (utility). Of these, some are passive and always on whether assigned or not. Unlocking these abilities is accomplished via 'training' in the strategic layer and is addictive in its own right as you manage your evil lair so as to provide your Kaiju with said training.   The Kaiju Defense Force is your cpu opponent in the game and, in addition to defending the cities you trash, sets up patrols in order to discover your evil lair. This is where a surprisingly fun addition to the game can be found for those who can get through the initial doldrums of a Kaiju with only a few abilities to arrive at mid-game: evil lair defense. In addition to outfitting your evil lair with production facilities intended to help fund your Kaiju training and development, you can setup defenses to decimate any invaders to your secret base once discovered. Despite the extremely simple nature of these invasions when they occur, they are deeply satisfying to watch when your defenses obliterate the invaders without any need for your Kaiju to intervene.  As far as flaws go, the KDF attacks come out of nowhere in city defense; they'll spawn right on top of you, next to you, or on the other side of the city seemingly randomly. In easier cities, they'll do this rather slowly, but in more advanced cities, they tend to do this quickly and at once. What this means is that, instead of fighting an organized defense, you're typically picking them off one at a time until harder cities. This isn't nearly as satisfying as breaking a well organized looking army and watching them flee.  This problem is exasperated in the later cities when the city defenses spawn very quickly and often right next to your kaiju. The differences between KDF tiers (organized by defcon levels from easisest 5 to hardest 1) are very stark; what is laughably easy for your Kaiju to deal with at defcon 4 is overwhelmingly deadly at defcon 3. Certain Kaiju's have an easier time dealing with this rampup than others, but the difficulty isn't linear at all between tiers and you'll find yourself playing 'ninja' hit and run with your kaiju instead of demolishing city defenses until you can get the right abilities to make everything trivial again. Once you come to terms with this, however, the game becomes deeply satisfying again as you realize what military units you can overwhelm and what you have to run away from.",
