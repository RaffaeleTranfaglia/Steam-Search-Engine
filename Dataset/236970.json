            "review_text": "this game has an interesting start: escaping the prison, learning the secret fighting technique for the first time, taking the quest and going on an adventure. the part where Amanda appears is when you see that the voice acting is bad. really bad. i appreciate the jokes, but they're not that funny. they're as 'meh' as this game is in general. a waste of time. there's a part when Jack is up for making his ♥♥♥♥ bigger. it's in the title, too. 'The Fire Within' is actually an &gt;erection&lt;, believe it or not. this game is all about making your ♥♥♥♥ grow, that's it. adios",
