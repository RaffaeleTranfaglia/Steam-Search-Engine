            "review_text": "--Pros and Cons review - Ends at recommend for the most part--  This fighting game has great mechanics, great action, a great story mode with a great story and a great cell shaded look. I own this game for PS4, both hard copy and digital, I love the game. I highly recommend it to everyone who hasn't got a PS4 copy of the game.  Getting into Guilty Gear is very, very hard as there are extremely good players out there who's ready to kick your ♥♥♥ 24/7. :D But hit the lab and you'll be seeing improvements, for sure.  This game has so much great content and is executed really well. You can't go wrong with Guilty Gear, ofc. if you like 'air dashing', cause that's in here. It's a very combo heavy and fast game and it's done really well and very stylish. You'll get your moneys worth, no doubt.  Now to the negatives, as I own the game already on PS4, I know how it looks on there, I know it has 1080p as max resolution. One of the things that sells a game to me on PC, is the option for higher resolutions, especially a belated release. I have a gfx card that can run this on at least 1440p@60. The game doesn't support an internal render resolution higher than 1080p.  What you get in this release is: The option for PS4 resolution, max. 4 sliders in your graphics settings for some post processing.  That's it. That's legit it. It's not enough to justify the price to me. No, no.  For everyone who wants to try Guilty Gear, this is the best iteration out there, I highly recommend it.  For you who already own the PS4 copy, don't waste your time if you think this edition is going to bring anything new to the table, - cause it really won't.  P.S.: Ofc. you can run gedosato and hack the internal renderer, but that's really not what the issue is here. The issue is that you're paying 66% extra on top of what you would atm. on PSN, and you are NOT getting anything different.",

            "review_text": "Great fighting game with an excellent netcode (3-4f delay 'Germany - Russia', 1f delay 'Germany-Netherlands'), an awesome soundtrack and a great visual presentation.   Every character (23 in total) feels really unique to play with and the game offers a great variety of missions, challenges and a tutorial to get used to the game. The online lobby system of XRD puts the main fighting game contender on PC (Street Fighter 5) to shame, because it offers an incredible amount of options to customize your lobby for your netplay sessions.  Definitely recommended for everyone who wants to try out a new fighting game and who is sick of SFV.",

Its easy to get in but hard to master - as it should be. Pretty much all the traditional modes (training, arcade, story, multiplayer and more) of a fighter are available and there are tons of splasharts, audio, movies etc. to unlock and sink time in.   This is a 'no doubt' recommendation, even with the heavy pricetag, as long as you are a fan of fighting games and/or anime-esque stuff.   P.S. --Played a couple of hours on console prior to the steam release--",

I don't have much to say, it's gorgeous (maybe the most beautiful Anime/Cell Shading until now in a videogame IMHO), easier to play than the previous entries but still very hard to master, musics are great, there's A LOT of content... On the bad side : it's expensive, the chara design and the story could be viewed as weird or silly if you are not prepared or used to Japanese Anime, and don't buy this if you don't like belts. Apart from that, it's an amazing fighting game.",

            "review_text": "The most recent Guilty Gear finally arrives on PC! If you, like me, are bummed at the mess that Street Fighter V was/is, have I got a game for you...  Pros: Characters - 23 characters, all unique and entertaining, with more possibly on the way Single-player content - With 'Episodes' for each character and a cinematic story mode for those interested in the deep lore, and a Tutorial, Missions, Combos for every character, and a robust Training mode for the lab monsters, as well as MOM for an interesting take on things. Competitive - Arc System Works has consistently had good netcode, and communities to play with are easy enough to find. Visuals - Stunning. Probably the best-looking fighting game in terms of aesthetics. Music - Daisuke Ishiwatari strikes again with new songs like 'Juno' and 'One Dawn', while it also includes the same old songs SIGN had and adds classics like 'Awe of She' and 'Irony of Chaste' from previous games. Gameplay - Fantastic as usual, and the addition of Throw Breaks and making Danger Time slightly less random have been positive changes.  Cons: Controller support - I'm using a DS4, and even though Steam supports it, REVELATOR does some...odd things. Slightly fixable through the config menu, but still visually confusing. Pricing - Kinda expensive, especially for the deluxe version. Also, two of the characters are Paid DLC, which kinda grates.  All in all, a fantastic game. If you don't want to buy it just yet, wait for a sale and you won't regret it. ",

Checked this out before getting some rest to see if it would run on this computer and if it was still the same as what you get on the console versions few months back. Everything checks out. Even added the figurine mode where you can set up a little table of figurines of the characters, changing poses and all matter of things about them.  This version currently doesn't have the large lobbies but you can still get into multiplayer rooms, those are still there from what I read on the forums.  The minimum to run this game is a bit off, though. I could run SIGN with a Radeon HD 6900 series and can run this game as well with it without any problems. Even the anime and cutscenes work without a hitch. So keep that in mind.  I'm extremely pleased this finally came to PC and happier to know that just like with SIGN, they built the game from the ground up to play on computers so this isn't some direct from console port.  ...now to make some time to sink into this game again. :D",
