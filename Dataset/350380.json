For a short period of time leave you feeling like you are the guy stranded on Mars and then being rescued, with amazing visual content that gets your heart pumping? YES. Enjoy the moment folks! Do it more than once and just allow yourself in and feel what Mark felt. Awesome.",

BUT..the $20.00 price tag is ludicrous, from start to end was +- 15 minutes, I really hope there are updates coming as I feel I have been knocked over the head and robbed. It is a nouveau cuisine vr experience, looks good, costs plenty but there is very little of it . IF I was a retailer doing a demo I would use this to demo VR, but as a 'game' for someone who already has a HMD I would not even recommend it at 1/2 the price.",
