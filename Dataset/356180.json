            "review_text": "Its a good game, not great due to a few factors (Vive related). I would recommend it though.   Pro: Pretty good looking game, although no AA. I understand they are worried about frame level droppage.  Re-allignment is easy since its not a room scale game  Cons: I don't like that when you load it drops back to the HTC Vive main room. You should keep the user in the game at all times even when loading. Just show a picture of one of the creatures or something.   The controls for the HTC (touchpad right side mainly) are not accurate enough. You should give the user an option to calibrate. Driving the pod takes some getting use to. I want to move my hands to far in each direction  You don't let the user explore, or if I'm lost trying to find the pad you say 'Out of area' and throw us back at the start. We are capable of going out far and we are sure capable of back tracking :) don't take the freedom away from the user.  Its still fun to explore and I'm sure any dino loving kid will just have a blast! ",

If you're even a little prone to motion sickness, do not buy this game! I've been fine with every other game, but this game made me feel like I was going to throw up within 15 minutes. I'm a paleontology freak, so I thought I'd love it, but the dinos were kind of dumb and cartoony - not realistic at all like The Blu, which was more what I was expecting.   I rate this game a solid 1/10",
