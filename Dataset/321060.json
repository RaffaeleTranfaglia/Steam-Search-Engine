            "review_text": "  So where do I start with this cancer? No, this is worse than cancer, and I know just how much it is. Let me tell you a story.  So one day in Hell, Satan asked his personal chefs to make the most delightfully horrendous meal. So the head chef decided to make it a burrito of the most horrendous things on the surface: DeviantArt fetish art, sexualized furry - and other things of that nature - art, dialogue typos,and characters, ideologies and a story that makes no sense. All wrapped up into an over priced mess. Having some touch with my mortality, I thought it was more horrendous than delightfull, but still brought it to Satan. When he gave us his seal of approval we knew we did a good job. But that cancer burrito gave the Prince of Lies some serious diarrhea and he was on his toilet for a while and it ended up clogging, and I had to deal with it. After unclogging it, at the end of the plunger was this game. Curious, I looked through it, and it was worse than any torture I had seen, and I was in Hell. So, I decided to show it to the dark lord, after looking through it for a little, he had his classic smerk and that told me everything I needed to know.Then he called for one of his assistants and told him to publish it on the surface. And so is the origins of this game, from the pits of Satan's personal toilet.  I don't know what else to say about this game that wasn't said in the story. It looks like it was made by a teenage deviantartist with a furry fetish, who doesn't know proper english, and is extremly ♥♥♥♥ing greedy. And the story makes no sense as no one really questions why people just randomly change to the opposite sex (not gender, there is a difference) and the people who do question, don't question for very long. Now, there's nothing wrong about a game where people have sex changes, it's totally cool and if people feel they need it that's cool. But this doesn't feel like a game that can give transgender people a character they can relate to, because the characters who have the changes willingly seem more like they want it out of fetishism than actual gender dysphoria.  So I got this game from a friend who got it free themself, the only reason I took it was as a joke. But that was a mistake, please, don't make the same mistake. Put down your wallet, or buy a better game, like LiEat :3",
