            "review_text": "Grapple is a fantastic, simple game, and is definitely worth the 8 dollars. It's a shame such a great game went unnoticed by most of the community.  In Grapple, you must navigate through various levels which get MUCH harder as the game progresses. You play as what appears to be a dark blob creature, with the ability to grapple onto certain surfaces. Your objective is to make your way through the level to what looks like a black hole while avoiding various hazards.   With 90 levels, hidden collectibles to find, and time trials to conquer, there's no shortage of fun. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone.",

In a nutshell, you're a ball of sticky goo and you can roll about, jump, and grapple onto things and swing. The game expands upon its mechanics gradually leading to a pleasant mild learning curve. If the devs were going for fluidity and a sense of motion in their game, they got it right. Really nice gamefeel. I'm not a speedrunner myself but if you're the type that likes to grind tenths of a second off your score then this game might appeal to you as well.  Final verdict: Pick it up on sale, it's a pleasant but barebones game.",

            "review_text": "There is a really good game in here. It looks great and the controls and physics feel great. Unfortunately the thing that really kills it for me is the camera. It follows really close behind the blob and is always dropping behind pieces of geometry and obstructing your view. Movement is also relative to the camera angle, so if you have a really bad viewing angle around the geometry (which was often in my experience) and instinctively try to adjust the camera, then the blob goes veering off into oblivion.  The gameplay footage in the trailers shows the blob swinging and gliding in these unbroken graceful arcs, but in all the levels I played, I felt like I kept having to stop so that I could move the camera around and actually see where the grapple points were located, because if I swiveled the camera while in motion, I'd veer off in a different direction and fall to my death. And this game has you crawling all over walls like spiderman, so your blob will go over the edge of a wall, and the camera just faceplants into the wall, so you try to correct the camera by swinging it around, but that messes with your movement, and it just makes a mess. I don't know. Maybe if there were some camera options to adjust camera controls or follow distance, but camera options are non-existent.  Clearly I'm the minority opinion, but that camera and I just cannot work together.",
