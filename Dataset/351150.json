The level selection screen reminds you of Super Mario World, along with good level design. Some levels can become a challenge, but they're still quite easily completable. I liked the music as well, it's nice and nostalgic.  Some seem to dislike the art in the game. But personally, I found the art to be quite interesting and unique. The art seperates it from other games in the platforming francise.",

The default keyboard controls are pretty wonky, but using a controller rescued it for me. X360 controller worked straight off and had a much more usable control scheme.  A win if you like dragons, platforming, and cute / lighthearted games.",

It has a wonderful play style, some wierd and difficult learning of controls, and wonderful art style that brings you feeling classy and like a child at the same time.   Honestly, well worth buying and trust me, a toaster can run this game like it's nothing.   Let's be honest, I would pay well over 5 USD for this game any day. I would recommend trying to buy this off of a website like Humblebundle, or any other of the sort like ♥♥♥ for a much lower price.   Would I recommend this? Hell yeah!",

The hand drawn and colored graphics looks adds an amazing feeling to the game that to be honest i missed initially.  Playing this with the steam controller is highly recommended as the game is just brilliant. Not only for adults but also for children of all ages. It is a work of art in all honesty...  The 2d gameplay and game map that reminds me of nights playing Mario on a nintendo really was refreshing.  The backgrounds, music, and gameplay with normal progression system made this game a must buy in my humble opinion and just to support the developers i will also be purchasing this title even though i got it free. I hope they continue releasing more titles.  Great job guys.  ",

I'd get to a really far point in the game and then at some point when I die, the game crashes and my data gets erased and I have to start over at the beginning. It really irritates. Otherwise, this would have been a great game to play. and I would like to see this problem get fixed hopefully soon. Just being honest. If all issues and bugs get fixed, then I'd be happy to play this game again and try to beat it! this game has potential if only it would work properly. It's a shame because I think this would be a great game without the bugs. I hope the creators understand",

So I'll review the startup, starting it up Steam tells me I'm 'in game' displaying 'In-Game DRAGON: A Game About a Dragon' in green text. I'm left to assume the game is in fact invisible and silent to human eyes and ears because all I see is my Steam library of games I've bought with my own hard earned money through labor and skill. Like the 7 cents I used to purchase this game. Well done on a perfect nihhilst masterpiece, but I didn't get any dragons so I'll have to say no to recommending this.",

            "review_text": "Dragon: A Game About a Dragon is a game that has been advertised on the well-known furry go-to masturbation pit e621. Given that this is a game featuring graphics that look like children's drawings, this made me feel even more repulsed. Was I, in fact, playing a game about a dragon that was drawn specifically to be masturbated to? It turns out that the dragon is a dragon who VAPES WEED AND WATCHES DAYTIME TELEVISION AND GETS HARASSED BY THE MAN, but the damage was already done. 'Am I playing a thing that weirdos jerk it to?' was the thing that stuck in my head as I played through it.  In case you're wondering, the game itself is pretty mediocre and unrefined. The developer had a nice thing going with his 'children's drawings' schtick, but that didn't immediately translate to 'what can be jumped on' when it comes to platforming, because the developer didn't bother to differentiate between the two states. So you'll be wandering around the game, trying through trial and error to determine what can be jumped on and what cannot be jumped on, which is REALLY GOOD PLATFORM GAME DESIGN.  Hey, you know what people love to do with cutscenes? Read them, because this game is like a children's book, for adults! (which is why it's been advertised on e621). So have all the words! Have all the words in your cutscene, dogg! That's what they're there for!  Also there's a bunch of obligatory RPG mechanics, just in case you can't hack the insane difficulty of jumping over and running past enemies. But upgrading is a tedious and annoying exercise that requires you to run back into your house, smoke some Puff The Magic Dragon, and stare at a character sheet with too much 'character-building' on the screen while it asks you to choose between trading in some gold for more HP, more flying time, or more dragon breath. Instead of, you know, pressing a button on the map screen and going to that directly.  So it's a game that's trying to be 'Go The ♥♥♥♥ To Sleep' without realizing that the only people who think VAPING POT IS EDGY in 2015 are shut-in Christians and possibly babies, and has also been advertised to people who presumably like to jerk it to dragons (among other fictional and non-fictional animals). If you are not one of these people, you are hereby excused from playing. Go in peace.",

Would be horrible on a 4k monitor.  * It might be a bit too easy if you're looking for a challenge, within 10 minutes I already beat the first boss. (That's like 4 levels)  * Control buttons kept flickering between keyboard and my Xbox controller.     It's a good 2D platformer, would recommend if you're looking for a cheap and easy game.    But if you're a hardcore competitive gamer, there's a high chance you won't enjoy this game one bit.",
