As told by the description, you're the world's second best jewel thief, and you're out to steal a very nice but supposedly cursed diamond. If you've gone through any of the CYOAs released by Choice of Games before, you'd be surprised to know this one is actually pretty short; I completely my first run through in about thirty minutes.That was a nice thirty minutes nonetheless, and for the most kept me interested. It's pretty well written, but subsequent playthroughs are the most likely thing to disappoint. Probably owing to how short it is, you really won't be making any big plot changes aside from a couple possibilities that seem to have no later consequence. Across a few playthroughs with different styles of approach, all that really seemed to change for me was who had to do what and how everyone felt about me, as well as a minor plot twist at the end that didn't have a huge impact.  It's still pretty good, and I like the story despite the fact I don't seem to be affecting it too much. I'd say $2 would be a better price, but I still got $3 out of entertainment out of it.",

My only real gripe is that there is no way to backtrack or save states, which means you need to start from the very begining from each divergant path, and I just can't be bothered to do that.",
