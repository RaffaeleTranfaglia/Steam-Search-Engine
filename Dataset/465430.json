            "review_text": "Buy it!   I had very little problem with bugs and glitches. A few times I had to use the teleport gizmo when I really shouldn't have needed it but the only time I got stuck was when I got too close the water, fell in and could not find a way out even with the wand. It's a great game and well worth the full asking price. I think this is the first free movement game I played that I would actually fall if I walk out over nothing... and you can't cheat by sticking your head through walls.  The only thing I was dissapointed with is the only really challenging part were the first two boss fights and they both happen early on. The game was still a lot of fun at other times but I wish there were a few more sticky situations and more traps. The first demo had a switch that opened walls around you and left you surrounded by flying bots. Nothing like that happened in the final game. There was only one trap I remember and it was easy. I didn't even get shot at before taking them all out. Also, I would have liked more puzzles. There is one difficult piece puzzle that was nice and another small one at the end that was more than just finding the keycard, color code or avoiding moving lasers.  That said, this is definitely one of the few games for vive that I didn't regret buying.",
