            "review_text": "Probably one of my favorite games, but it's not for everyone.  It's in its own unique niche in terms of skill, so nothing you learned from other games carries over really. Infact this game reminded me what it was like when I first started playing video games, because it was so out there. It pretty much took me until 3/4ths into the game before I felt completely comfortable with the controls and gameplay, and the missions are very replayable both in design (large various paths) and with the fact that you can use different combination of agents.   I feel though that anyone saying it's badly designed and clunky isn't really justified. This game relies a ton on strategy and positioning, so the most I would say is if you get caught completely out of position with your pants down it can  feel  clunky because you have to on the spot deal with pressure which is difficult when you have 2-3 sometimes 4 units in first person perspective. So being caught off guard can be really punishing at first when you're adjusting to the micromanaging, although it is a strategic game so it's fair.  Combat is kind of a non-option in this game unless your idea of combat is flanking enemies and not having an open firefight. A lot of the guns aren't really effective on more than one guard (minus sniper and shield), however it is extremely forgiving defensive wise as your agents have a lot of health and you are given ~10-11 lives per level. Dying can be a pain though as the new agent is parachuted in at a certain point with nothing but a melee weapon, so you need to retrieve your items or just leave them and steal a guards guns (as long as you didn't lose a valuable item like the radio)  All in all, this game is 95% positioning and tactics 5% shooter, and it makes it really interesting and fun to play after you get use to having to micro 4 first person cameras.",

            "review_text": "The game is fantastic in its concept and core idea, but I feel implementation wise its far from perfect. I think that as a player I have to have quite a lot of patience and be quite forgiving when playing it, but if you put your mind to it it is quite ingenious! It's one of the most complex setups I've found, even for a tactical shooter. Take your time, don't rush the tutorial, and use saves regurarly! :)",

            "review_text": "Every once in a while I'll end up getting into a game I got in sale because some small quirk about it interested about me during a sale, and will sadly decide that I just can't dedicate my time to finish the game because it feels clunky, too meticulous, unresponsive, or any other experience-ruining gripe you could come up with. I really wanted to just drop Signal Ops after diving into the first mission after the training session and just stream a playthrough to consume the story (after all, what was the harm if I had already purchased the game and had no intention or chance of getting a refund?). Surprisingly, there are very few videos of this game that are not done by the developer, and even fewer online comments on strategy for some of the more challenging levels. HowLongToBeat had zero actual submissions for the game when I started, and I was curious as to why. Had I stumbled on to something so obscure nobody was playing it at all, and nobody had played it all?  Thankfully, I got through the first mission and was hooked. The stealth mechanics are as addictive as any other AAA stealth game I've dove into in the past few years, and despite multiple failures a mission, I found myself coming back to the PC to give it another go. While this game takes place from a first person perspective, gone are the reliable guns and fast, agile movements of a traditional FPS. Movement is slower and feels almost cartoony by comparison. This was the most jarring change for me as a player of many multiplayer FPS titles. Once I got the hang of the pace of the game through the course of the first mission, things started getting more interesting, so I reccomend the gameplay side of things with reservations that it may take some getting used to. The main crux of the gameplay is you are sitting at a chair with multiple monitors, controlling multiple characters at once by switching monitors with the number keys. The number of screens available depends on the mission, and you unlock more character archetypes as you progress through the story (Spy, Wrench, Bolt, Shield, etc.). Each character has their own abilities like sniping and lock picking, and its up to the player to navigate through missions without getting caught by the enemies. The developers have built a beautiful oil painting style world to go along with the game, where everything from the trucks to the door knobs adhere to this asymmetrical, painted aesthetic. The environments lend themselves well to the Eastern European, Cold War vibe seen in titles like Papers, Please, with a slightly more animated, hand-drawn feel to them. The story has a bit of mysterious religion versus government, new world order conspiracy stuff tied to it, with massive underground compounds, arms deals gone wrong, and lethal espionage capers all helping give the game a bit of a 50's spy movie feel at the same time. The ending, while satisfactory, still left many questions in my mind about the world that was built around the gameplay, and I hope to revisit it again someday.  If you can get around the lack of resources for being stuck in the game, appreciate a good stealth experience, and have the patience to adapt to the controls, the game is really worth it. I wanted to drop it after the first hour but logged almost 20 once I got into it.",

            "review_text": "A novel approach to squad based strategy and co-operative play. Takes a simple framework and builds on it with some good quality voice-acting, unique world and story behind it.   Worth the money, needs some practice to get things feeling natural though since the game cannot decide whether it exclusively wants to use a controller or not (still displaying controller Icons when no controller except a joystick is present).",
