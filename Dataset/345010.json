            "review_text": "Very fun concept, but crashes *CONSTANTLY*. Monthly subscription system is a major turnoff, too. Comes with a few months by default, which is nice, but there's a huge wall of grinding between you and getting to a lot of the features the game is advertised for. I have over a dozen hours and I'm still literally just grinding cash, trying to get a spaceship capable of going exploring out into the systems outside of the base 9. Most of this grinding is done by clicking autopilot buttons. Settlement and star base construction system has absurdly dumb crafting times (time per module is measured in a number of real time hours, often numbering above twenty - freaking - hours!). Number of colonies and star bases you can have is based on how much real money you spend per month - you can go and buy bigger subscriptions to get more planets. Your control over the planets you colonized is based on how many people have built colonies there and how willing you are to involve yourself in the politics process. As in, in-game elections and such. Which is an interesting concept, but I hesitate to see it in practice as it strikes me as a potentially nasty means of griefing. Combat is *extremely* clunky and awkward, and the radar system is in desperate need of a revamp. Indicators are small and difficult to make out unless you expand the radar, which makes it difficult to aim your frontal guns, which are fixed with your movement. There are broadside and 90 degree cone turrets, but those are totally automated and have no player input beyond placing them on your ship. As far as I can tell, there are no variety in weapons, and combat is restricted to one zone.   All in all, this game strikes me as something I would expect to see out of an alpha. The graphics are rather weak compared to performance (I have a Radeon r9 380, 8 core AMD processor, and 16 gb ram, and my FPS on the second worst setting ranges between 60 to 30 in normal play, but the game's actual material in peak settings is on par with something that's like, ten years old?), it crashes pretty much once per hour. Sometimes those crashes are severe enough to require a hard restart of my PC -- I checked on the forums and this isn't an isolated incident, either, and has happened to people on a wide range of systems - on high end to low end computers. Combined with the massive grind wall to get access to the content with even a shred of depth, and this game was a huge let down for me. I *really* wanted to like this game, but *DO NOT* let the trailer fool you. It is *not* what it's advertised as.",

            "review_text": "State of the Company I am not getting paid anymore, and I'm personally almost out of money. I'm in the red, if you add it all up, probably not what where you want to be a few months before your 40th birthday, but as I said to a colleague in the middle of an all night coding binge:  'I would rather go bust making something special, than get rich developing something 'meh'.'   And I think that just about sums up the Fluffy Kitten Studios philosophy, for now. The company is not in great shape. Sales until now have slowed to a crawl. I think people are thoroughly sick of buying early access games in general, and Steam is now absolutely flooded with indie titles all vying for the same market. The number of games has grown at a pace that leaves the market growth for dead, and the vast majority of our potential playerbase has still never heard of us (this became abundantly clear at PAX, where most people we met were Australian - and we've had some press traction here - and almost none had heard of us).  We now have over 19,000 people who has wishlisted Ascent who haven't bought it yet. We expect a small portion of those to buy it when we 'release' (steam has just begun emailing wishlisters when a game comes out of early access, fortuitous timing for us) but we will also need some action from the press to sustain development for the rest of the year.  And that about sums it up. It is now very much crunch time for Ascent and Fluffy Kitten Studios. There is no chance the company will fold or the game will end (I still run it on a test server at home and it's fine. I could operate it for you with NO income), but there is also no chance I will be 100% full time on the game any more in May or June if we can't FINALLY get some press traction and make some significant sales.  So, everything now hinges on what happens on April 11 and the following few weeks. Fingers crossed our press release gets through this time.  From the Developer's mouth. What 3 Dev's are working on this game? Bull crap!. 3 devs have worked on this game in the past but NOT anymore. The game will NOT be developed anymore unless the STEAM sales makes it so and look at the steam forums a few noobs and a few fan boy's. You will get tired of mining, trading and building colonies btw the graphics for the colonies is early 1990's. $20 bucks is a total rip off, even at 50% off its more of a waste of your time. Maybe if this was made 15 years ago it might be worth some time but with games today why in the hell would you play this one.   The bad ........   The state of the Company. Nuff said.   The good......  When you uninstall it and make better use of your game time.",

            "review_text": "This Game is the Game I have yearned for my whole life.  Sure, its in its infancy and the graphics are not AAA but for someone that loves building an empire in space, this game is looking like the one for me.  Unlike so many space games, you cant be Ganked here. Thats key for me.  A persistent universe where i can gradually unwrap the layers of the game and learn its complexities as i go, slowly but surely building from my little hornet starter into a sprawling empire (hopefully) over time will keep me busy and interested for many months if not years to come.  The in game help chat has been amazing, and the responsiveness of the developer to player issues has been nothing short of stellar.   If enough of you out there that are looking for a corner of the universe and buy into this game, I think it will become something very, very special as its grows into its full potential.",

It has a great physics engine, interesting asteroid mining mechanics, and very detailed settlement/starbase system.   The devs are active and very passionate about thier game, you can find them almost daily in chat helping folks out and discussing future development of the game.   The Ascent universe is big and complex and requires you to think. I've really been enjoying my time playing this game and am excited to see its community growing.   To the stars!",
