            "review_text": "Don't pay attention to my playtime, it only counts time in the launcher Great game although old. These sorts of games no longer exist. It resembles Silent Hunter Sub sim with crew managment although if you wish it can also be a hard-core B-17 simulator, down to starting up each individual engine ( the flight physics aren't the most detailed). One problem is that the controls aren''t the least bit intuitive. Imagine trying to start up a B-17 without even having been into one before. Bottom line, I highly recomend this game to anyone that loves Silent Hunter, B-17's or flight sim fans as this will provide for hours of fun.",
