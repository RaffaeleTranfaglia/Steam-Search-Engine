I had gone to dell for driver updates before for my laptop, and they gave a few, but not nearly the range Driver Fusion offered to update. It corrected and updated the drivers on my laptop, I saw a noticable increase in performance when playing games. I gained atleast 10 FPS on Dragon Age Inquisition and alot more stable performance on my PS2 emulator. Highly recommend it to people who can't or won't hunt down all the drivers themselves for updates, it is worth updating and maintaining them.",

I could not find a scheduler in the software to check for drivers every once in the while, or maybe it's not there. I don't know, but it would be nice to have. I'll just check myself once in a while, it's not a problem as it only takes a few seconds.",

            "review_text": "I don't normally write reviews on Steam games, but I do think my experience is worthy of a review. I know that this particular software has had both good and bad reviews, so I wanted to share my experience.  I bought this software back when it was on sale. It seemed like a good idea, in theory, but I never actually used it. My philosophy on software drivers is: if it isn't broken, don't fix it! The last thing you want to do is install new drivers and break a computer that is otherwise working fine. But, the software was interesting and had a lot of potential, and Steam sales are great, so I bought it; thinking that I could always use it later (or use it on my wife's computer if she encountered an issue, etc.) Another tool in the toolbox, so to speak. I loved the Steam license that lets us use it on any computer we are willing to use with our Steam account: that is a very fair license for someone like me who is responsible for all of the computers in this household. I never condone piracy, but sometimes software licenses go too far the other direction and prevent legitimate use by the rightful owner. So kudos to the developers for that.  Fast forward a few months and I bought a new game on Steam during this winter sale. I think it is called Arch Mage or something. The game has an intro cut scene that was choppy as hell on my computer. Very strange, my computer is normally fine with any game, especially a cut scene. (Who ever hears of a cut scene lagging? Weird.) I did some Google research, and discovered that it was a common (enough) issue and the suggested solution was to update the audio drivers.  I almost never think to update my audio drivers. Once again: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. But, now I actually had something broken, so I decided to ry this Driver Fusion software. I installed it, and went through the slightly annoying registration process. Yes, you need to register and get another stupid account just to use this software. I take back my kudos, developers. I'm so tired of having a separate account for every damn thing. That is why I love Steam in the first place.  Anyway, no big deal. Everything requires a registration these days so I just sucked it up and registered. How did the actual software perform?  It worked. Exactly as advertised. It (very quickly) scanned my system and listed all of the out of date drivers. My sound driver was definitely out of date, along with a bunch of other weird drivers (mostly associated with the mother board) such as the PCI express driver(s), etc. It also listed my keyboard and mouse.  Now, this is important: It lets you uncheck drivers that you don't want to fix. I did unselect the keyboard and the mouse driver. Once again: if it isn't broken, don't fix it. I hate it when drivers update my keyboard and mouse, because then all of the mouse acceleration curves and keyboard macros, etc. get deleted/messed up. Have you ever upgraded your mouse driver and spent hours trying to get it back to how it was before? I have. It is painful.  So make sure you LOOK at this list and only check the things you actually want to update. For me, I updated the audio drivers, and the PCI drivers. Those seemed like logical candidates for fixing my cut scene stutter issue. The software did its thing, and it actually worked really quickly. It claims to have made backups (I assume it did, I don't want to test it) and gave a nice status bar for the progress. The status bar was even accurate and everything worked without hangups. So, the developers can have their kudos back.  Then, after rebooting my computer... I rebooted a second time. You can never be too sure especially when updating drivers. Afterward, everything seemed to be working fine. I also manually downloaded and re-installed the NVidia graphics card drivers. I already had the latest version, but after updating all of my motherboard drivers, reinstalling the video card from scratch seemed like a really, really good idea. So I did, and rebooted for a third time.  When I fired up the Arch Mage game again (the suspense is killing you, admit it)... it worked! The cut scenes play just fine and the driver updates did their trick. So, yes, I definitely recommend this software. It did what it claimed to do and it fixed my problem.  But: updating drivers is always risky. Don't do it 'just for fun' unless you really don't care if you have to reinstall Windows. I highly recommend following the same process I did. Basically: Only update drivers if you suspect it will fix a real problem. Uncheck everything that you don't want to update. Be very careful and very specific, use this tool as just that: a tool that can help you find drivers that you would have updated anyway. And when it comes to big/important drivers like your video card: always get the full package directly from the manufacturer (NVidia or AMD). I would only use this product for more obscure drivers that are hard to locate. If you know the real source, use the real source.  Oh, and reboot often.",

Neither driver was known to Driver Fusion Premium. Also, I have two 'Unknown devices' while the software finds 0 missing drivers. Even the latest-greatest feature to disable auto-update of drivers in Windows 10 can be accomplished without the Driver Fusion Premium, directly in Control Panel of Windows (it's a bit hidden, but Google will quickly help you find it).",

I bought this product so i wouldnt have worry about tracking drivers down. Would be nice if it kept all my systems drivers updated but as is it has failed me.
