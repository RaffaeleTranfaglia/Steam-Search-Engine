            "review_text": "Original premise for a game... too bad the game itself is an unoriginal NES platformer.  As Mike, you must survive through Valley Lodge by leaving your family behind in order to jump, run and shoot snakes with a pistol. Sometimes you get a shotgun, which shoots a three-way projectile that won't hit anything else than whatever's in front of you. The first two levels of the game follow the movie, but everything is thrown out the window once you reach Level 3, which looks like Castlevania... as in it reuses the same graphics! Also, the boss of this level was supposedly so good it got reused in AVGN Adventures.  When Level 4 starts, your protagonist says 'What a horrible night to have a missing wife and child!'. Enough said.  As the game advances, the game stops bothering with Manos and becomes a Mystery Science Theater 3000 tribute. Tom Servo does a cameo in Level 2 and most levels involve enemies from other B-movies like Hobgoblins, Robot Monster and Plan 9 From Outer Space. Why call it Manos then? The setting fails because the writing is all centered on references, trying really hard to wink at you and say 'Hey this happened in the movie, right?'  The game could have been good if the gameplay was interesting, but it isn't. You only shoot in a horizontal line and enemies just bounce back and forth forever, making fighting a joyless affair. Bosses are equally as mindless. The only challenge the game offers comes from occasionally unfair enemy and trap placement, where upon hitting them, you will bounce back in a pit and die. The game sometimes spice things up by making the whole screen dark around you, preventing you from anticipating obstacles and multiplying deaths where you fall in pits. Other levels are autoscrollers, which don't really have a reason for happening and forces you to progress at the game's pace. There's also a vertical autoscrolling level that rips off Castlevania 3.  Overall presentation is also weak. The graphics and sound are appropriately NES-styled, but they have no substance and fail at making an impression. The game also offers difficulty levels, but don't bother with them: all they do is remove health pickups, shotguns and checkpoints from levels. Yes, it makes the game harder, but it doesn't make it fun.  Manos will take you about 45 minutes to finish, maybe more if you want to get the full ending or finish the Torgo playthrough, which just switches sprites, makes you do lots of annoying noises and is slippery as all hell. The complete unoriginality is what mainly kills the game though; it doesn't attempt to add anything new to the old-school game formula, unlike games like Shovel Knight, Binding of Isaac or Axiom Verge. This game is about as faithful to its source material than a LJN game would be, so it's good at reminding you of LJN!",

            "review_text": "I haven't finished the game yet, but I like what i've seen so far; old school platforming with run 'n gun elements. Fair, even generous checkpointing system, humble yet endearing graphics. All in all something I would recommend in short bursts, well worth the modest price, even better if (like me) you get it in a bundle!",

            "review_text": "A solid, straightforward platformer set in the absolutely bewildering 'Manos' film. Of course it takes extreme liberties with the source material, though never as strange as Darth Vader turning into a scorpion. Environments are expanded upon, all set to 8-bit renditions of the movie soundtrack, with a new level set in Plan 9 from Outer Space. There's a lot to like, though absolutely nothing original to the gameplay- it's a quick and easy-ish play for lovers of all things Retro and/or Manos.  I leave you with two words: Torgo Mode.",

            "review_text": "This one's pretty much on the cusp of being recommended. Two things push it into negative territory: an anti-virus conflict that prevented me from playing for months, and being designed to be annoying.  'MANOS' is both designed as a callback platformer shooter to movie licence NES titles, as well as an homage to the infamous MST3k episode featuring the 'film'. The production values and controls are much better than the games it's based on and it's thankfully briefer than the movie.  Unfortunately, the horrible film-grain shadow obstructing your view, the airplane hand of fate, certain checkpoints (namely the nigh-unescapable pentultimate one on the last level) and generally uninteresting bosses aren't enjoyable or even funny, even with a few drinks in you. Most of the MST3k references and the game in general will sail over most potential buyers' heads, and only the torgo theme stands out amongst the soundtrack.  In short, this is too niche and annoying to recommend. It's pretty short and easy, but ends up being too similar to what it's mimicking.",

            "review_text": "The niche is just too small; MANOS/MST3k fans need only apply. But even there it doesn't deliver a solid experience. All funny or clever references are very early. Then the gimmick wears away more and more with each cheap death after cheap death. You just end up with an unforgiving poor platforming game that is a test of your will more than anything else. Sure my will held and I conquered it, but by that point it felt more like luck than anything. Mix in controller support issues when keyboard controls are extremely unsatisfying? And yes, sadly I cannot recommend it at nearly any price. Which does indeed sadden me because I am that niche. I am the target audience. I appreciated the effort but its a firm no from me.",

Pros: Funny Feels like an Old School NES game, specifically Castlevania Challenging Cheap Has the same spirit as the original    Cons: Only Controls you can fix are if you are playing with a gamepad Short No Manos themed Emoticons and Trading Cards (I'm normally sort of against this, but I'd love having a Torgo emoticon on steam)   Overall, pretty fun, I'd say get it on sale, or if you are really in the mood for a old school style game.",

The game is filled with platform game sins. New gameplay elements are introduced by killing you pretty much instantly. More than once you have to take a leap of faith just to hit something this pushes you back a little and lets you plumet to the weird void that kills you. In the third level you can walk up stairs, but if you think you can drop to the level below by failling of a ledge you are wrong. You can only go down in places that show a stairs. Most levels end in a boss battle. These battles are a pain in the ♥♥♥ as it's just shooting a lot of times (note: you cannot move and shoot) and trying to jump way from the pixels that hurt you. Luckily in some cases you can just hide in a corner where the boss cannot reach you. The game is about an hour long, or at least, if you can suffer through so much.",

            "review_text": "this game is a p funny parody of a particular NES subgenre, namely really bad platformers based on popular films (see the beetlejuice NES game, for example, though pretty much every NES game based on a film was pretty bad and often unplayable tbh) - a phenomenon you might be familiar with if not through personal experience then by having watched the angry video game nerd or a similar reviewer. the big difference between the games MANOS: the hands of fate parodies and the game itself is that MANOS is actually playable, while maintaining the feel if a glitchy weird-♥♥♥ platformer based on an intellectual property that really shouldn't be a platformer at all, and maintaining a believable NES aesthetic (compared to, say, shovel knight, a game that would've never been released for the NES). while many of the challenges presented to you by the game might feel insurmountable if you just run into them, it's all really just about observing patterns. this is kind of like what those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ NES games wanted to be, i guess? definitely worth the purchase if you enjoy NES homages - it's also the first game i've run across that's paying homage to the part of the 8 bit era people would rather forget, which i think is kind of funny.",
