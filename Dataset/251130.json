            "review_text": "Chroma Squad is a Tactical RPG made by Behold Studios, the developers behind Knights of Pen &amp; Paper. Chroma Squad is a love letter and a tribute to decades of Japanese superhero shows such as: Super Sentai, Kamen Rider and the Metal Hero series.   =STORY=  You start off as a five-people team of stuntactors who decide to make their own Sentai-themed TV show in which they become a Sentai team themselves and fight against all sorts of monsters while managing their resources and fan-community behind the scenes. The first two seasons start very tame since you’re still an indie Sentai studio with a low budget, but from season 3 onwards the plot becomes more serious and fascinating. Depending on your choice during the finale of season 4, you might either end up doing the Rider route, the Metal Hero route or the Sixth Ranger route. I won’t spoil much, but each route has their own scenarios going on with interesting mini stories that contribute to the game’s lore. The finale of the game itself is amazing, and is something to behold and be amazed at – I’ll try not to spoil it, but it’s definitely “empowering”. Mind you, the game developers have suggested to implement more alternate endings or routes within future DLC or updates, so this review might end up dated and not give a complete overview to what the story system of Chroma Squad offers.  = CUSTOMIZATION =  This is arguably my favourite part of the game, ‘cuz who doesn’t want to make their very own Sentai dream team? You can customize your team by choosing out of approx. 20 actors, each with their own appearances and bonuses. You can also name them and decide which suit colour they wear, i.e. if you always wanted to make an all-Red ranger team, well here’s your chance!  Throughout the seasons, the game offers various types of helmets and suits that not only give certain statboosts but also visually alter the appearance of your hero. Unfortunately, the amount of actors and visual-altering equipment you can choose from is quite limited, so you’ll have to either wait for future DLC or step up your modding skills. You can also name your studio, your team, your giant robot, your transformation and lines of dialogue that call forth said mech, transformation and team attack. While it doesn’t give you the ultimate customization possibilities like customizing your own hero costume or actor from scratch, the game offers a decent amount of customization which will hopefully be expanded in the future.  = GAMEPLAY =  While the game is a turn-based tactical system, it’s not as complex or multi-faceted as Super Robot Wars, but neither is it overtly simplistic. You generally control five characters, each with their own stats depending on equipment, actor, role and bonuses you’ve activated through studio upgrades or siding with the more favourable marketing agencies. Each role offers a variety of skill, the Techie and Support role are for example more oriented on long-range and healing skills, respectively.  Your characters can generally do two actions per turn – in most cases you’ll (1) move to the enemy and (2) perform an attack or (1)(2) move to the other end of the screen. Your heroes can wield weapons which not only increase attack damage but also provide with an extra skill. Last but not least, there’s the Teamwork mechanic in which you can make two or more of your heroes pull off an combined attack at an enemy they’re both facing. The giant robot vs giant monster battles have a more mini-game feel to it, but it can still be one heck of an intense battle. It’s a sideview turn-based battle in which you can hit the enemy multiple times until your turn is ended through missing the opponent, ending your combo with the defend options or ending the turn with a super attack. During the enemy’s turn you must step up your reaction game to minimize the amount of damage your mech will receive. Outside of missions, there’s also a light Studio Simulation system going on – i.e. you’ll get to read and answer fan letters, upgrade your studio for additional bonuses, upgrade your giant robot, buy equipment, craft equipment or materials and side with the marketing agencies that give you the best bonuses or help you earn and gain more money and fans.  = OVERALL =  If you’ve longed for a game in which you can make your own Sentai team and fight against hordes of enemies with the help of unlikely allies and your trusty giant robot , then look no further because Chroma Squad is arguably the best Sentai game if not one of the best Henshin Hero games up to this point. The story, several dialogues and fan letters will make you laugh and smile – and perhaps, even give you the feeling that you’re being a true hero of justice. Gameplay-wise, Chroma Squad is a very accessible game but not without a challenge for those who want to step up their game. While the visuals and soundtrack aren’t AAA-tier, they’re still pleasing and amazing to see and listen to nonetheless. This game is definitely made with love, and it shows. I can’t wait for the future updates and potential-DLC this game has to offer. Behold Studios, you’re the best and thank you for this amazing loveletter to decades of tokusatsu heroism.",

            "review_text": " What I liked:     The combat, yet simple has some depth    The music and the charming yet cheesy story    The whole TV management gameplay aspect   What You Need to Know:     Yes it's similar to Power Rangers, but this game is good on its own not for being nostalgic (I’m didn’t watch the shows as a kid)     The combat is turned based, luckily the animations are fast and you’re not bogged down waiting for the enemies turn even when a dozen are present. Each ranger is a class with special abilities that grow in number with each season.    The game is based on a TV of these fake rangers, but the story gets weirder as what’s real and fake blur the line. Each episode you play has optional objectives that when completed give you lots of fans(this is your way of making more money and getting better marketing perks). The first 3 seasons these were important to get as many as possible. But still missing some of them is ok and still not be crippled later on, plus a lot of them are easy.     But some bosses spawn mines or spores by the dozens each turn which I did not like. But that was only 2 out of the 30+ bosses you fight.     The game has a funny/corny story; I never skipped over it because it was entertaining enough to me. If you don’t like it you can skip it all very easily. There is no voice acting, so you will read the dialogue. It even has choices you make by email which will give you either in game rewards, like money, fans, materials or weapons or just the satisfaction of responding to a fan or person in need. Some even choose what bosses you fight so you won’t fight all the game’s bosses in one play through.    The game even has 3 different endings where the last season of the game changes depending on your choice; you have different rangers you can pick at the start of the game (which you can name) along with the email choices above give a good replay value.    Now the TV show management side is very easy and isn’t hard to understand. You have marketing team which you can pick from a lot with new ones each season offering different benefits, like more money, fans damage, item drop and more depending on who you pick.     You have crafting which is cool, offering more variety of armor and weapons that the shop doesn’t have. The shop and items you craft are both viable with neither being the obvious op choice.     Next are the mech battles, you customize your mech by the 5 parts of the body (head, torso, 2 arms and legs). These you craft and once start leveling up your parts to high tier it’s going to be hard to get the materials to swap if you want to. Now the battles themselves are simple, your main attack with every hit you gain a combo but lose in accuracy, so there is some luck involved there. You get abilities depending on the parts you picked for your mech. Overall these battles are short, flashy and fun to mix up the fights    I played the game on the middle difficulty and failed about 3 episodes (there is a penalty for doing this). So it’s not that hard. Playing on the easy mode would be a cake walk if you’re worried about how difficult the game is. The game even though it’s simple does require planning and synergizing your team’s abilities and timing when played on the higher difficulties    My Score:",

            "review_text": "Aaaah! After 10,000 years I'm free! Not only from the infernal hellfire of school, but from that god awful writer's block! Time to conq- write; write a review. Sorry. It's on Chroma Squad, so strap in.  REVIEW Chroma Squad  GENRE Tactical RPG  STORY The year is 20XX probably. Five stunt actors with attitude are recording their parts in the most recent episode of the hit sentai show sensation: Super Rangers! The show stinks though, and so does its director: Dr. Mi Ah. [More like MAMAMiAh, amirite?] No cool monster fights, no struggles against the higher ups, and most of all; no giant mecha fights! Our heroes are fed up and, immediately after finishing the recording session, quit Super Rangers to start their own sentai show. The gang sets up their base of operations in Blue's uncle's warehouse; unsure of where to begin. However, in the center of the room stands a large object obscured with a large bedsheet. Pulling the sheet off, our actors find the start of their new journey, and after signing a contract or two; they're ready to Lights, Camera, Chromatize!  GAMEPLAY Chroma Squad is very unique in its gameplay, fairly simple, but unique nonetheless. You control your units on a grid, taking turns moving your units and allowing your enemies to move. Simple. You can utilize a teamwork mechanic to not only group up on an enemy, but launch your rangers to spaces they couldn't normally reach. Unique. Each of your units has specific passives and abilities tailored to their class. Simple. These abilities may come into play for completing 'director's instructions'; secondary objectives that will give a healthy boost to your audience. Unique. Every mission features a big boss monster that has its own special attacks and abilities. Simple. Just like in Power Rangers though, the monster becomes gigantic after you beat it; bringing you into a risk-vs-reward kaiju fight minigame. Unique. You get the jist.   Outside of combat you can upgrade your gear, improve your studio, answer e-mails, sign marketing agencies to your show, and upgrade your mecha. Upgrading your gear not only increases certain stats, but visually changes the look of your heroes for hire. Improving your studio provides you with an advantage while recording your episodes; though you really shouldn't think too hard about them. I'm not rally sure how upgrading your light fixtures makes enemies less likely to dodge attacks, but I also don't get how so many people burn their meals while watching my show. E-mails range from heartfelt to crazy and everything in-between Sometimesyou get fan-mail about aliens and tinfoil hats, and other times you get companies asking you to buy a 'sword enlargment kit.' Marketing agencies provide temporary bonuses in and outside of combat depending on which agencies you sign your brand to. Personally, I always chose Toys-R-Fans because I like money having money; lots and lots of money. Upgrading your mecha simply gives it small bonuses during the kaiju fights, such as increased hit chance or a chest beam. Y'know, little things.  VISUALS The visuals are nice, not too complex, but very charming. The pixelated aesthetic compliments the game nicely; and this especially shows in the exemplary boss design. You'll start out fighting monsters like Boxing Box; a cardboard box with boxing gloves. [You're on a tight budget okay?] Eventually however, you'll be fighting intergalactic evildoers such as Tengu, a Japanese demon with cloning capabilities. Either way, the game was pleasin' to my eyeballs and I think it'll please yours too.  SOUNDTRACK Hot diggity dog, this is a good soundtrack! Featuring 31 unique tracks composed by a variety of artists; you couldn't ask for anything better to accompany your multi-dimensional misadventures. Each track fits its respective scene beautifully, with the timing on some of them being downright god-tier. [That might be a bit of an exaggeration, but you get the point.] Personally, my favorite track has got to be the main theme. I can't tell you how much time I've wasted on the main menu listening to it. I probably need help.  FINAL THOUGHTS It takes quite a bit to make me buy a game based off of impulse alone, and Chroma Squad happened to have that special something. It was charming, enjoyable, and just challenging enough from start to finish to keep me wanting more consistently. In a way, I got hooked on Chroma Squad the way you get hooked on a show. My first thought after beating an episode was 'Man, I can't wait to see what happens next!'. Being able to choose my actors and their names was a great touch, and the ability to modify the catchphrases and names of aspects of the show took it to the next level. I don't think I'll ever get tired of a wise, robed monk yelling 'Prepare for dank justice!' before turning into a spandex clad superhero. The gameplay is simple, but brings a unique twist to just about every aspect. The dialogue is... cringe-worthy at times to say the least. At the same time though, it reminded me of the horrible dialogue in my favorite shows as a kid. I love the look of it, and I don't think I'll ever quite get over how fantastic the music was. This game is by no means perfect, but for what it's worth; I'm willing to say that this is everything that I've ever looked for in a videogame. It panders to my inner-child, it indulges my unhealthy addiction to customization, it scratches that tactical gameplay itch, it gives me goosebumps when I listen to the music, and most of all; it makes me remember why I love video games. Thanks Behold Studios, I needed something to get me outta this rut.  Ohheytherealsomayormaynotbeanactualalienthreatthat'sgonnadestroytheplanetifyoudon'tstopitsogoodluckwiththat.",

            "review_text": "A great and at times, hilarious, retro tactical RPG. No level up system so the equipment system is the only way to change character stats. This causes a pretty simple tactical RPG system character-wise. Most of the strategy is in the battles themselves making sure you choose the right abilites to accomplish the objectives or 'director's instructions'. Marketing and upgrading your studio are the other two micro managing things you'll do between stages ('episodes'). Both pretty much letting you adjust rewards for completing episodes or helps you gain bonus stats during them.   The other major part of the game is the Mecha battle! Although they can get a tad bit tedious, it's Costume Quest-esque fun. You ugrade your machine parts, but in the end the pieces are all pretty similar. The mecha fights are all the same, your hits are die rolls, and missing a 95% hit is infuriating when they pummel you 3 times in a row after. The saving grace for Mecha battles is that you can hold Enter to fast forward them like cut scenes.  The dialouge is pretty funny and the story riddled with pop culture references, this makes for a special kind of humor. It has a pretty entertaining story and kept me hooked all the way through. When you do finish the game (I recommend it), keep clicking!",

Now, some people say you should watch a sentai series or something to understand this, but I started playing this game having watched one episode of Power Rangers in my entire life. I used to think that toukatsu looked pretty cheesy, but this game has given me a new view of it, and I actually kind of appreciate it now. The game can be summed up as 'X-Com meets Power Rangers' basically. You control a team of five people, and each one has their own special moves and name. The team is highly customizable, and I've actually grown attached to my hilarious looking squad. You also frequently fight kaiju (big monsters) in a big robot of your own. The game also has a pretty neat crafting system, a fanbase system, marketing stuff, and even MORE! If that doesn't sound cool enough to buy then you obviously have no soul. Anyway, give it a shot, and if you aren't sure, wait for a sale. It's worth it!",

            "review_text": "It's been a while since I last properly sat down and played an SRPG, and I was honestly weary to a degree with the whole Super Sentai's Powers Rangers theme Chroma Squad employed. Needless to say fact I beat it in under three days after I actually began playing should tell you I was way off that mark.  You create and assume the roles of your five-strong Super Sentai group, process which is done through choosing which character will assume each role (Lead, Assist, etc) and there are quite a few cameos ranging from actors to pop icons you may recognize. I had fun naming my totally-not-Weasley-Snipes “Eyes-Open”, but that's beside the point. After that's done and over with you find out they're disgruntled stunt actors on a related show who decide to create a new studio and show of their own. These are the humble beginnings game presents you with and it's customizable down to Ranger colors, studio name catchphrases team will employ. Far be it for me to say that's ALL there is to this story, and oh boy does it escalate, but it never loses that sense of “we're running a show here” which is further enforced by character's comments, episode setups and constant camera crews on the set.   This illusion is never broken because no matter what happens you're still making a show which nets you fans and money. Both are important for keeping your studio successful because it lets you craft gear from materials your enemies drop; things like tape, cardboard and glass, or straight up buy new stuff from the store. You will also want to invest in your studio for things like HD cameras which net you more audience per-episode, better health insurance for HP bonus, etc. It's definitely sensible and tongue-in-cheek with the mood of the game. As befitting a Super Sentai team you will also acquire a wise MENTOR and Mecha at your disposal, latter which also gets its own separate upgrades and is used in 1v1 fights against giant opponents.   As far as actual meat of the game goes, that being combat, you'll quickly discover your team of five is constantly outnumbered usually 3-to1 if you're lucky and keeping your gear up snuff is a good idea. As each of the five seasons go by your characters unlock another tier of skills you can choose form so you're not just brute-forcing it. In fact, I'd argue game is somewhat on the easy side unless you really want to do all of Director's Instructions aka specific set of objectives in each episode which may be on the tricky side but are also a great way to get more audience, except in the very last part when that difficulty spike becomes too real. It does make for a fitting conclusion, but also drags down what should've been a way more intense end game. I will say that send off itself is amazing and no game that plays the theme track can do wrong by me in that regard. It turns out your show is pretty radical and watched worldwide.   If there are any negatives they are very few, mostly on the side of some Unity engine shenanigans like some scripts not being timed correctly which leads to some delays, hang ups when game has to display things like a ton of audience bonus gained from healing and alike, but I would probably point out overused Mecha fights in the last episode or so as the worst offender for me. You don't have to end each episode like that and especially not because you'll notice hit percentage is still RNG-driven so it'll eventually turn on you. I also wish game was longer, but you can also have too much of the good stuff.  So, did I like Chroma Squad? I loved it. Really got me motivated to play some more SRPGs when I get the time and had me grinning like a maniac at times. You gotta accept it is, well, episodic at times because that's the source material it draws from, but stellar soundtrack really kicks in at times and does wonders for overall impression. If you're even remotely interested in these games give it a go and remember to GATTAI at your earliest convenience.",

I'm usually not a big fan of games with a turn-based combat system, however Chroma Squad knows how to make it fun and interesting. Team attacks, finishing moves, acrobatics, and skills are all at your disposal while fighting the hordes of enemies thrown at you. To my surprise, the game also implements a crafting system. Enemies will drop loot that can be turned into gear. In addition to this, you may recycle old gear to gain some parts, which in turn can be crafted into nicer materials to make better gear. There's a shop too, and a place to buy studio upgrades. All in all, there is a lot to see here, and the funny dialogue and refreshing gameplay make it a great experience.",

Created by Behold Studios, Chroma Squad is essentially a Power Rangers management sim. You get to make your own squad and customize your team to fit your desires of having one of the best or lamest Sentai teams ever!  The story is that a bunch of stuntmen quit their old job because they believe their director lacks creativity and want more creative freedom. The plot really goes off the rails later on but it's fun to watch. The dialogue of your team is super corny but I loved it however if that's not your thing then it might be something to consider if you're planning on getting Chroma Squad. The dialogue is filled with puns, references and enough fourth wall jokes to make Deadpool blush.  Visually it looks nice, it's some nice pixel graphics. I don't think they use it as a lazy excuse since it's nice good to look at and there is detail in the game. Not the heaviest but enough to distinguish everything easily. The music is personally one of the best parts of the game. This is some really good chiptune music, it has some great soundtracks that get you pumped up for a boss battle and my personal favourite 'This is Cerebro' is so campy and so catchy.   The gameplay itself, when fighting is a tactical RPG. A pretty fun one, the game has an emphasis on team attacks which is pretty cool and works with the theme. You got abilities and cool weapons for the different classes to play around with and a cool chunk of bosses. You also get finishing moves for them which is pretty sweet as well. One thing that does bother me a bit is that a lot of the time the game can be too easy but then there is a huge difficulty spike in the last level. What is that all about?  When not in normal combat you're doing one of two things. The first is managing your studio, it's fun as you have to upgrade the studio, buy or craft new gear, hire agencies to promote your show, check emails and all that managment sim stuff. The other is the mech combat. It wouldn't be Power Rangers without a giant mech battle in almost every episode. It can be fun but really it just comes down to chance whether attack or block attacks. It looks cool but it's pretty shallow.  To conclude my mad ramblings I of course like this game a lot! It's one of those games I wished I played earlier when it came out last year. If you understand the basic core material you'll have a lot of fun with it. If you've never heard of Power Rangers AT ALL or know exactly ziltch about it then I wouldn't reccommend this to you. Otherwise you should definitely get it! It's a game that's about having fun rather than being amazingly unique or difficult (for the most part). I give this an 8.5/10",

I havent tried the other modes beside casual yet, but the casual mode stays true to its name and if you want a real challenge you should try the other harder modes.If i would give this a number score it would be 9/10. I strongly recomend it.",

The simulation doesn't matter that much it basically functions as an upgrade menu so don't expect much from that end of it but the fighting felt good,although a bit tedious at times due to crazy ammounts of knockback. From the sound of most of the negative reviews they were playing on harder settings, but I was playing on casual because I never have enough time to beat long rpgs on harder difficulties, but anyway it seemed a little too easy until the end game. I barely won so I can only imagine how difficult it must be on harder settings, as It was a good game but I am not likely to replay it as it did get a bit tedious towards the end, especially the giant robot fights which were cool in concept but always boiled down to the exact same thing. Anyway I got this on humble bundle and wasn't disapointed, check it out if you want, or don't its your time and money, this is just my opinion that I felt necasary to write as I just played this for about 8 hours over the last couple of days and was mostly hooked.",

Making fun of the source with a 'look how stupid this is' attitude. That is certainly not the case. Chroma Squad is very self aware, but is a celebration of the genre! It's light hearted, tongue-in-cheek humour, and most importantly: fun.  The gameplay may be basic when compared to other tactics based RPGs however the dressing (for lack of a better word) more than makes it up. Perhaps I am biased, but the idea of running my own Sentai production company, with control over the costumes and props, and studio, and marketing etc. coupled with the absolutely charm of the writing... I can't describe how happy it made me.  I feel exteremely bad for waiting this long to pick up this game, and through a humble bundle no less. The developers of this game deserve full compensation for doing such a magnificent job.  I don't think you NEED to be a tokusatsu fan to enjoy this game. The writing makes it very accessible.

This game mixes strategy with the over-the-top action, spandex, robots, and explosions of any episode of Power Rangers, and does a phenominal job of invoking the inner child who was too young to see sucky special effects.

You like to grind press a quick-time eventbutton 20 times, while waiting or a randomly generated percentage attack to hit or miss ? Well this is the game for you. To add insult to injury in the middle of the game there is an episode which is just mecha battles one after the other, like the developers just gave up and said ♥♥♥♥ it...

            "review_text": "Go-go SUPER LUCK SQUAD!  I'm reviewing this game purely on the gameplay aspect. There are plenty of positive reviews regarding story and sentai fanservice.  This is based on playing the highest difficulty: This game is a decent turn-based game in it's own right. There isn't much strategy to it. A bit of planning is involved to complete the director's instructions, but in the end it all comes down to luck. The most important thing to making equipment, materials, all based on luck.   I have one save file where a certain material I obtain in abundance, and really dont need it as it's mostly for the starter equipment, and another save file where the only material I've been obtaining is the make the same pair of gloves. If you dont keep your equipment up to snuff, your rangers are as good as dead or too weak to complete director's instructions as the episodes difficulty increase. _____  Now for the actual gameplay. Here is wear luck becomes absolutely infuriating. Let me give some examples: Now, remember, you control a squad of 5 rangers. The director wants you to kill all of a certain enemy within, say, 3 turns. There are about 10 enemies on the field, and you need to focus on 3 specific ones. Those specific ones need to all be dead in 3 turns. Sounds simple enough, plan out how you'll position your rangers to catch them and take them out.  Now, let's get to the problem:  - Most of the squishy enemies, unless you luckily score a critical, can't be killed by a single ranger. This means it will take two of your rangers attacking to guarantee that kill. After a ranger attacks, they're done for that turn. This means it should be no problem for you to kill 3 of the weak enemies within 3 turns. Let's not get into details about some rangers having to use up their turn just to move around and get close to these enemies. We'll just presume you'll probably be spread thin and only have a kill average of 1 enemy per turn.... wait, change that from 'kill' to 'chance to kill'. You have a 'chance' to kill 1 enemy per turn. So if you happen to miss this chance, you can kiss that director's instruction goodbye, and restart the episode. Let's type how this will play out if you're unlucky:  First turn: you manage to kill an enemy. Second turn: you manage to kill another enemy. Third turn, your last turn to complete the instructions, and you're only one kill away: you order your rangers to attack and... the enemy dodges. Well, you're screwed. Time to abort episode and try again. This is how many of your games will play out. This may not be too bad when it's just the start of an episode. However, there are times when an episode has 3 parts and you can spend an hour of your time going through the episode, completing all director's instructions only to have some unlucky crap happen at the very end and have to restart from the very beginning.  That's a lot of time to be wasting over something that's completely out of your control, luck.  I'll give you one of my recent episodes as an example, there are three parts. The first two parts are simple enough, the third part involves a boss that can heal itself and many enemies around that heal. You have to kill the boss within 10 turns and finish it with a finishing move. A finishing move requires all your rangers to be next to the boss and attack together(use Teamwork).  Technically, you have to kill the boss within 9/10 turns, since he will stun your rangers(making you unable to use the finishing move on the 10th turn, as it requires all of your rangers) on specific turns... one of those specific turns being the 10th one. Now, that seems like a pretty decent time to take out the boss. That is, if you're lucky. Let's play this out:  (We'll skip the small details and say you manage to get rid of the healing minions within 3 turns. You now have 6 turns left to take out the boss, who will also heal himself for pretty hefty amount. If you're lucky, he wont heal too often. If you're unlucky, he might heal twice in a row, making all your damage done to him in a turn, null. You still should have no problems as long as you manage to keep hitting him every turn and wittle him down. Given you have proper planning, you'll be just fine!)  Turn 1/6: You manage to quadruple the boss, and dealing enough damage that will allow you to outdps his heal. Turn 2/6: You deal enough to outdps his heal again. Turn 3/6: He dodges, completely wasting a turn, and heals himself. That's okay, you see that you still have a chance to take him out in time. Turn 4/6: He dodges again... okay, it might be close, but just maybe you can make it. Turn 5/6: He dodges again, and heals. He's now at full health again, it's game over. Time to abort and do the whole episode again, taking up another hour of your time. _______  Let me give you one last situation. In this one, YOUR luck can be your downfall in completing instructions. Let's say you need to kill 4 enemies in a single turn. Well, remember how it can take two rangers just to kill one enemy? You have 5 rangers, it takes 2 to kill one. Simple math, you can't kill 4 in a single turn. Unless... you plan ahead and simply soften them up to kill at once later. You're so clever. A tactical genius in the making. This shouldn't be a problem, you've got the plan and the means to execute it! What could go wrong? None of the enemies dodge, you manage to soften up 4 of them enough to where any single ranger can finish them off in your next turn. There's absolutely nothing that could go wrong. Unless... &lt;.&lt;  It's the enemy's turn: The weakened enemy attacks your ranger, it's super effective! At least super effective against the enemy, because your ranger decides that of all times he's going to choose this time to do a counter-attack. The softened up enemy dies. Now you only have three softened up enemies, maybe you still have a chance. You'll have 3 rangers kill the 3 softened ones, and your other 2 rangers can double attack some other enemy. Unless... &lt;.&lt; It's still the enemy's turn: Another of the weakened enemies attacks another ranger. You couldn't possibly be so lucky you counter attack again, could you? I dont think I need to say where this is going. You know you're screwed, abort episode and try again.   The game could also stand to give some actual info on the stat points. There seems to be no info on the usefulness or effective amounts for Cooldown Cost and Skill Regen. There are other stats as well that have no explanation in the game, and you just have to guess and hope they're worth investing into.  If they cut out all of the luck crap, it would be an entertaining turn-based game that actually rewarded you for proper planning. Instead, it's always a roll of the dice. I dont know how many hours Steam will say I've played this game, but my first save file is 11 hours. My second save file says 3 hours. So any beyond that was just wasted time from having to abort episodes.",

I spent a good ten minutes trying to come up with my own team name and catch-phrases. The tactical RPG aspects are simple and enjoyable, and I like a more streamlined approach to gearing the squad. What I really love about the game, though, is its consistent charm; from my characters yelling my ridiculous catch-phrases, to the Assist character constantly using emoji's in dialogue, to some of the ridiculous bosses you face (shout-out to Transitmancer), I often had a wide grin on my face while playing.  As for gripes, well, the Kaiju battles got repetitive; spam Punch until you were at about 60% accuracy then pop Defense, Defend self against enemy's attacks, repeat. It'll probably be harder on higher difficulties, but I found myself getting somewhat bored during a battle between a GIANT ROBOT AND A GIANT MONSTER. Also, there were a couple bosses who kept doing knockback abilities that kept me from doing a Finishing Move, which happened to be a side-objective for that Episode, so I spent maybe twenty minutes trying to get into the correct position.  That said, though, this is perfectly viable nostalgia fuel that manages to be fun, engaging and lets you have a beaver on your superhero team. Sheer brilliance.",

Plenty of 4th wall breaking too +Massive quantity of customization. From outfit colours, to the actors inside the suits, to the effing Catchphrases to transform and the one to call your Mecha.  +Lots of items to craft and buy to outfit your characters and give them different attributes. RPG veterans will spend quite a while in the room outfitting   -You won't get too many abilities in this game overall for your actors. And the classes are set. Just a little thing that might just be me nitpicking. -If you fail an Episode, or decide to restart it, getting to the point you were at, skipping all the text is a bit tedious. I did feel like I was being punished for restarting the mission, instead of going through and failing it and taking a hit in my fanbase.

Killing on a counter attack is fine but if the counter attack is countered and something dies, that is when the game locks up.  2. The final mecha fight outright cashes the game when you launch an attack after a specific point. I am unable to get one of the endings because of this.

The fights never over stay their welcome in the easy mode, the challenge of the higher difficulties are fairly noticable (though they need to stop fixing what was already a good game), and it's just fun to make up your own power rangers team name and special lines. the upgrading system is all based on the items you buy or craft so you be really tanky or deal ALL the damage. my only issue is the craftable armours and weapons aren't as good as the shop items thanks to RNG-ness deciding if the weapon has an attack buff at all and lator shop items tend to be weaker in weapon but not in attack base making more about using your basic attack then anything else but it's sad saying even THAT is better then hoping to get a good weapon via craft...

The way the dialogue is corny and the team up moves are all taken from power rangers and i love every single second of it.  As for the turn based strategy, the game is pretty fun. While other games like Fire Emblem or FF tactics have more interesting and robust systems, the combat elements in this game are still fun. Complexity doesnt always mean fun game play.

More in depth, I'm a little disappointed with the tactical depth of combat. There aren't many ways to mitigate damage during combat. It feels like enemies can attack at arbitrary ranges and move across the map at will. All-out attack is usually the best option, tempered only by the games scoring system, which encourages drawing fights out longer. Even seven hours in, I only have access to one crowd control skill, and very limited area attacks.  The crafting system seems expansive, but the game is very stingy with crafting materials, which is a problem for the mech combat minigame. I found myself buying items from the shop just to try breaking them down into spare parts. I really wish there was a way to buy the materials you need from the shop. Collecting drops from enemies seems contrary to the theme of the game--why am I making the lead's costumes out of scraps from the extra's costumes?

You can customize your super group down to their respective color themes, names, catch-phrases, and so forth. The songs fit the mood of the moment splendidly, and I'll likely be buying the soundtrack later.  Seeing as I usually prefer more complexity to my RPG's, it's hard for me to indicate exactly what drove me to like this game as much as I did. Maybe it was just fighting an obvious reference to Barnie to Dinosaur in my Mecha as we towered over the city, combo-ing fists and lasers before I miss and lose the initiative. Maybe it was the progression of starting as a low-budget series fighting a guy with a traffic cone on his head, up to a full-fledged studio. Maybe I'm just vain, and desire as many Fans as I can get by being Cool Guy in front of a camera, with a charisma and acting talent I could never attempt in real life.  The point is, I got genuinely excited during some of the pivotal battles in this game, and that's deserving of praise.",

            "review_text": "A tactics game where you play as a Power Rangers TV studio. Game is split up into episodes (where you do battle) and in between episodes you spend your cash/craft upgrades. It has a silly story with silly enemies and plot. Story is mostly told through dialogue so doesn't get very deep. A lot of 'just because' reasoning so you have to go with the flow. Things that happen outside dialogue are often just quickly summed up by the narrator to set the scene. Graphics are good enough and sound fits well.  Episodes are often split up into 1-3 tactics battle segments and sometimes finished off with a mecha battle. The tactics system is pretty standard and simple. There are only damage and status effects, no damage types (no physical vs magic attack, no elemental resistance/weakness). The mecha battle is a regular RPG slugfest where you take turns attacking each other. You can do multiple actions in your turn and each action builds up your combo meter (which increases the effect of your next action but decreases the accuracy). In normal mode, the enemy mecha usually just does 3 regular attacks one special attack. You reduce damage taken through a timing minigame (there's a bar that fills up, stop it at the right time and you block more damage).  It feels like you want mecha battles to be over as soon as possible so it feels better to go for as many 50%+ accuracy attacks as you can rather than ever defending. It seems like enemies usually do 3 attacks of ~5k damage each and defending (maybe unless you go for max defense) only blocks a total of ~5k of that. It feels like a race against the clock so the less turns you take to defeat the mecha, the less turns the enemy has to deal 15k+ damage.  However, it does get a little frustrating when you miss your 2nd attack (~85% accuracy) twice in a row, which is brutal because of your missed damage output (especially if you're holding onto your finisher for a high combo) and it means you take free rounds of damage. But I guess that's why there's the mecha audience meter (DBZ spirit bomb-esque gathering the energy of your fans). When you lose all hp in a mecha fight, your hp meter refills with audience points (though losing hp from then on doesn't seem to affect audience score later). Assumably, the more fans you have the more HP you get.  In tactics battles, your performance is calculated by an audience meter which goes up through combat actions and by following the episode's director's instructions (which are bonus objectives like 'win in 5 turns' or 'keep all members above 50% health). In normal difficulty, clearing missions wasn't too hard but clearing them while following the director's instructions was sometimes pretty challenging. However, you don't need to do every instruction to max out your audience meter and it doesn't seem like failing them matters if you fill the meter anyway.  Boss enemies sometimes have line attacks but they feel unpredictable. The attacks don't hit a standard grid-based area (not clean 45 degree directions) so it's more realistic but you can't tell what it'll hit. One boss has a burst aoe (starting from himself) that usually hits allies hidden behind other allies but there were rare times where it didn't (only the one in front got hit). Sometimes the cubes served as cover, sometimes his attack hit despite the cube being in the way. Maybe there is no such thing as cover and it just randomly misses without showing the 'miss' text. He burst twice in the same spot on one turn and hit 2 on the first and all 5 on the second.  The only real indicator I could see of how much damage you'd do is the enemy health bar (which shows how much remaining hp would be left after the attack). It can be a little tough to see if an attack really finishes it off or if there's a pixel left. It would've been nice to see an obvious indicator (like the bar turning gray) to show the attack should finish off the opponent.  Alternatively, you could check your attack stat for how much damage you'd do (only for single attacks; I'm not sure how teamwork attacks affect damage).  Seems to let you retry missions relatively easily (via abandon mission) so if you like to retry there's no need to quit/restart the game. If you don't, then you can personally choose to make your own hardcore mode by accepting whatever result you get. It's pretty nice for me because you go into episodes without knowing what you're really up against so you can abandon and customize/upgrade as necessary so you can beat the mission. Also, some director's instructions (mission goals) can be ruined by unfortunate events outside your control.  It allows you to fast forward through cutscenes which is very nice. However, it sometimes speeds through the first text bubble even when I didn't intentionally click or skip through. It may have captured a click several seconds before during a cutscene or something. It would be nice to also have animation speed options in settings to make quicken actions and be able to fast forward in-battle quips.  [Side note: why is 'go' and 'fas' blocked by steam? Wanted to type 'go' and 'faster']  Other thoughts:    One tactic is to pull back and give a turn to let the enemies chase you, often clumping together for aoe skills.    Audience bonuses from marketing may not count towards the audience meter cap (meaning if you max out the meter it still counts as a bonus towards the cash/fan conversion). Would be nice to have that cleared up in-game.    Mostly polished but there are some quirks. Dialogue bubble gets cut off in one sewer scene, breath-&gt;breathe typo.    Seems like some e-mails don't deduct the right amount of cash? I know some options say they'll cost a certain amount but are reduced but those mention it in the reply.    At hotdog stand battle, it feels like there's a minion that comes in on the left side that doesn't get placed on the map?    When you have a flat +fan modifier at end of battle, it still shows as per 100 in the tooltip (you have +175 fans per episode but it shows as 175 fan conversion per 100 audience)    Seems like you're supposed to lose audience when a party member is downed but it either doesn't work properly (audience bar visually is reduced but actual number isn't) or there's a hidden buffer you get by overfilling the audience meter.    Seems like   Tammy   is supposed to get into the mecha (and sometimes she teleports with the rest) but they didn't make a new cockpit image, still only 5 people.    Although normally fine, sometimes I had a little visual lag/frame skips when blocking in a mecha fight, making it hard to time blocks properly.   Worth a try if you like the theme (a studio making episodes of Power Rangers) and are fine with simple tactics games. I don't think I would like it as much if it were a generic tactics game (the combat system isn't very deep) but I think they play up to the theme very well. Reminds me of Punch Club (silly story, good-enough game) though I think I enjoyed this experience more.",

With a well written set of dialogue, and a surprisingly deep combat system Chroma Squad is sure to please strategy fans... even if you haven't seen power rangers!      Chroma Squad, in an depth action strategy game that never ceases to amaze me! With large a (and albeit, very obvious) inspiration from Sabans Power Ranger. Chroma Squad is a game that will make you want to relive your childhood... and at the same time want to destroy it. You see Chroma Squad's difficulty system can be changed on the fly for those of you who don't want to think... If you do enjoy a challenge however, play the game on hard mode (warning! PLAN ABOUT THREE STEPS AHEAD ON HARD). This game can, and will kick you in the rear so hard you won't remember what you planned to do afterwards. Chroma Squad has a very (from what I have played) unique system called teamwork. This system allows your teamates to perform double, tiple, even quadruple attacks (similar fire emblem fates), but there is a catch... teamwork is the only way to use your finisher (a vital tool later on) , and can allow your team to move further on the set! Now you may be wondering what can make this game so difficult, IMO I believe Chroma Squad is one of the few games that got difficulty right. It doesn't just swarm you with hundreds of cheap, or extremely powerful enemies, atleast not in the beginning. Chroma Squad has a real sense of growth meaning that as you get stronger the game can and WILL adapt. Mecha battles, this feature surprised me. when I had my first mecha battle I was pleasently surprised. Though simple the mecha battle can really make you question your 'startegic genius' and really mke you pull your hair out if not careful.     To sum it up, this game seems very simple, and easy on your first run. That fact can be a lie, the game can be very challenging to the extreme on the harder difficulties, and the AI can be very ruthless and capitalize on every mistake you make. The premise is great, and the game has this atmosphere that I find hard to explain, but enjoy. The mecha battles are a nice break from the normal gameplay. Worth a buy. if you watched Power Rangers for sure!  My score: 5/5 (6/5 if you enjoyed Power Rangers as a child)",

Struggling to get a leg up and gradually improving your team's costumes to get more fans to get more stuff for your studio/cast is a rewarding cycle of endeavors. I hadn't even heard of this game until I got it in a Humble Bundle with some other things I wanted. I am not disappointed so far! One thing I didn't like was that the mech battles seem to be driven by RNG in the worst possible way. 75% chance to hit = you will miss 90% of the time. Just a heads up. update: if absolutely awful final bosses are a pet peeve of yours, you should avoid this game. 99% of it is *sooo* good. And then the final boss is a teleporting enemy with the worst arena layout. Get close to attack, he teleports and then it takes your squad like 4 turns to reach him. 2 hits, then he teleports across the arena again. Instead of being strategic, it's just unnecessarily drawn out and boring. The game still gets a positive rec from me, but I don't know what the devs were thinking when they made the finale.",

If you have positive feelings towards Power Rangers from your childhood, and you like lighter-side story centered RPG strategy games, you'd probably like this.   Its strong points are numerous; it has item crafting, a good story, challenging but not overly brutal strategy, combat is fun, good humor, likeable characters, nostalgia (without leaning on it too heavily), etc.  Weak points might be that some mechanics can be a little tedious. Kaiju battles never got boring for me (there's like 8 or so in the game) but they're all pretty similar. Also, some people don't like pixel graphics, so if that's not your thing then move on. Also, the game tries (and succeeds) in capturing the campy nature of power rangers style shows, so if that's going to make you cringe then you could consider it a weak feature.",
