I only played on easy but the difficulty seemed perfectly balanced, and there are 3 other difficulty levels if you are more of a hardcore player (Nightmare difficulty has to be unlocked by beating the game). Graphics and sound are both great, can't think of anything wrong with this game, bring on bloo kid 3!",

Would be much better with a run button, v-sync options a duck animation to make things more interesting while adding the tradiitional 'A' button to the down motion when dropping from platforms. The menu is another thing I hate about it. The Angry Birds/Android-sytle options with circular buttons just aren't appealing. The timer, well, I'm OCD so I'm going to be collecting all this stuff and the timer will run out every time. How is that fair? I'm certainly not going back just to get speed records while missing everything, the layout is a linear middle ground, no need for all of that. It's very easy on hard difficulty. And I can't run. I recommend it because the sprites bring back that feel of the SNES era, however, lacking what I previously stated along with possibly the damage animation, it's unfortunately a flop from the '90s. But still playable, especially for youngins' 4/10",

It is not something too out of the ordinary, but that is probably one of the alluring things about this game. It is quick and easy to pick up and play, and if you want to test yourself, there are 3 different difficulty modes. I have not played ALLOT of this game yet, but this is not that type of game. It is a simple yet very fun game, and it will run on just about any PC. Completely compatible with the Xbox 360 controller. Packs a real punch for the price!",

I was thoroughly surprised at how good this game turned out to be! Comes highly reccomended! Thumbs up!",
