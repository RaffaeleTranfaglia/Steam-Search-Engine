Just picked up this game today and i have to say it's pretty fun and for 6.49 dollars is not bad.  If you like strategy games that don't get repetitive quickly i would suggest this game.  8/10!",

It's a fun little waste of time to play with the physics and figure out the puzzles. That said, sometimes the physics are frustrating because you might know exactly how to blow something up but a barrel doesn't fall just right.   Still, it's pretty cheap and has workshop support so I guess buy it if you want a short little physics-y action-y puzzle game to waste some time with?",
