            "review_text": "The expanded sequel to Nobunaga's Ambition Sphere of Influence which has added way more options of play as well as more intricate gameplay. For those who liked Nobunaga's Ambition SoI but thought it was maybe a little to simple in some parts then this is the game for you. Finally you can play as an officer in a Nobunaga's Ambition game much like the RotK games 7, 8, 10 and 13. Now you can choose to rise from a minor family in a clan to a major domo for your daimyo or even become the daimyo.  Combat now has full battle maps depending on location, what was attacked and how high leveled the place is such as if it had a camp or is a high level castle. The game also allows for you to both marry characters in game and now have fiction children so you dont need to set up your kids pre-game and can play the game more organically. Sadly you cannot play ronin like in the Risshiden games but being able to play NA: SoI but with way more options is insanely fun and planning out your home clan area by building the districts like in the new Civilization 6 is very fun.  If you liked NA: SoI or like strategy games like Crusader Kings, Europa Universalis, Total War or any other strategy games then you should definitely think about picking this game.",

Really really really not recommend, it's just adding new gameplay for officer below daimyo and new scenario after battle of sekigahara until the death of yukimura sanada. I'm refund this game after playing those NEW boring gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Overall a very good game, but very hard. The game takes a lot of time, and a lot of patience, even when using created officers. I gave this game an A+ rating because of how indepth the game is, the realism, the gameplay, the graphics, and the music (oh god the music is outstanding).  If you're looking for a game that will give even the best strategic and tactical minds a workout, this is it.  The only drawback to the game, speaking from a feminine point of view, is the lack of being able to marry yourself off playing a female character and not being able to have children. However, this is just a minor thing and shouldn't stop anyone from buying and playing this.  NOTE: If you want an easy game, this is NOT it. With that said, I am enjoying every aspect of this game top to bottom.",
