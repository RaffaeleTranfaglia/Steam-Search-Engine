But what ruins it for me is that you basically need to invite your friends to play otherwise you can't unlock the cool stuff. Of course you don't NEED to harrass your friends.... you can also buy credits and unlock things that way.  Great concept, poor execution.",

            "review_text": "This game has a lot going for it, but also a lot of major issues.  Pros: Very detailed and accurate gun models. Gameplay is surprisingly engaging. I found myself trying to optimize ways to strip and reassemble the guns to get the fastest time. It's pretty cool they managed to make gun maintenance fun in a video game.  Cons: A few...  1. Poor performance. Even on a 4670k and R9 295x2 the game will still occasionally crawl to a halt and stutter. This is probably the fault of the Unity engine. 2. Ridiculously long tutorial that still somehow manages to not explain things very well. 3. Incosistent on what parts are grouped into assemblies and which are counted individually. Sometimes you have to remove individual pins/screws, other times you don't.  Now the big problems:  4. Free2Play mechanics. The game is set up so that completing every game mode and getting most/all of the achievements for a gun will give you just barely enough XP to unlock the next gun. You essentially have to grind each gun until you can do it fast enough to get enough XP to progress. They then offer expensive 'boosters' and DLC to help you progress faster. No thanks.  5. (Final straw) The shooting range mode is apparently totally broken. I unlocked the 1911 shooting range and after a couple tries managed to complete all of the challenges. However the game did not recognize this at all, and when I returned to the map my &gt;4000 XP had disappeared and I was at 0 XP. This is a ridiculous game-breaking bug and is unacceptable in a final release.  This game is good in concept, but terrible in execution.",

What they don't show you: You unlock more guns through 'experience', which you earn painfully slow by doing all the strip and bad operational challenges for every gun before it. The only way to unlock these guns without hours of crap is by buying 'experience' points in absurd bundles. There are also vehicle disassembly portions which I couldn't review because they're their own seperate DLC. If you want everything this game has to offer, you're probably spending somewhere around $50-$60.  I'd much rather pay $15-$20 outright for this than weave around their sneaky DLC scheme. Don't support this publisher until they change their tactics.",

            "review_text": "Every lover of the 2nd Amendment Beware! This game will absorb all of your freetime!  Just kidding! Don't worry guys, although I'm on here nearly everyday, it not too addictive.   It is however a very fun and educational program about firearms, and its FREE! However, I will admit, for extreme gun gurus, this game may be dissapointing for its somewhat watered down approach to firearms dissassembly. When I got this, I was thinking 'AWESOME', finally a game that will help me figure out how to dissassemble my AR without getting shot in face the with the Action Spring! However, it turns out there is no in-depth explaination of the dissassembly process for any weapon.   Actually, the game is more about raw step-by-step memorization than anything . . . . Although you will be able to see every single firearms 100% dissassembled, and learn whice pieces need to be screwed/unscrewed first, there is no explaination about the methods of dissassembly, or the purpose of each individual part, or even groups.  In other words, the game runs as simply as this. In all of the game modes (except operation and shooting range), you have a 3D model of a weapon, you wait for the computer to 'clear' the weapon by racking the action and expelling all ammunition, and then it is your job to click the pieces that are to be dissassembeled 1st, 2nd 3rd, as the computer automatically dissassembles the parts/groups, and all the way until you have a complete 3D exploded view of the weapon, and then click the pieces in backwards order.   Although there does seem to be some inconsitencies with the ordered parts in this game (on the AK-47, you must click the 'butt screws' before dismantling the wooden stock, however on the MP-5, the lower receiver just falls off magically?), this goes does serve as a great INTRODUCTION to each weapon. The operation mode allows player to watch the weapon fire with X-Ray vision, to watch the parts interact, however, there is no further explanation.  Another word. The game is FREE, therefore there are a couple draw backs. You do not have access to all the weapons at the start of the game! You have one starter gun, the AK-47, then you must master the dissassembly of this weapon to get 'XP' before unlocking more weapons! And oh, there is no list of weapons to choose from. Although weapon progressoin is not linear (there are often a couple branches to choose from), you will have to slog through some boring weapons before getting to your all-time-favorites. I will however REDEEM the developers by saying, this does force a player to actually master a weapon, and often times GO BACK to a previous weapon to re-learn and hopefully get more XP, but it can be really tedious . . . . OR you can purchase the game for $40 and have every weapon unlocked!  However, start with the free version to make sure you can handle it ;)      ░░░░░▄▄▄░░▄██▄░░░ ░░░░░▐▀█▀▌░░░░▀█▄░░░ ░░░░░▐█▄█▌░░░░░░▀█▄░░ ░░░░░░▀▄▀░░░▄▄▄▄▄▀▀░░ ░░░░▄▄▄██▀▀▀▀░░░░░░░ ░░░█▀▄▄▄█░▀▀░░ ░░░▌░▄▄▄▐▌▀▀▀░░ THIS IS BOB ▄░▐░░░▄▄░█░▀▀ ░░ ▀█▌░░░▄░▀█▀░▀ ░░ COPY AND PASTE HIM, ░░░░░░░▄▄▐▌▄▄░░░ SO, HE CAN TAKE ░░░░░░░▀███▀█░▄░░ OVER STEAM! ░░░░░░▐▌▀▄▀▄▀▐▄░░  ░░░░░░▐▀░░░░░░▐▌░░  ░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░█░░░ ░░░░░▐▌░░░░░░░░░█░░░",

After several more hours of tinkering, I decided that I'm sure I will invest more money in this game. Based on the fact it's been out 2 years successfully, has tons of iconic guns I love and some I have, and many more interesting guns in development, I belive this is pretty real. It's alot like an interactive version of the 'Forgotten Weapons' YouTube channel.   At this point (10 hrs), I've not used Exp. to unlock any new weapons. I've got 31,000 Exp. points to show for my time so far, which can only buy a few guns or one of the expensive ones. I haven't minded a moment of the 'grind' so far, it's kind of like a really fun version of going to school. I am, however, probably going to buy the $50 lifetime guns access in the near future. As with the few great F2P games I've played, I've determined that it's more effecient use of my time to earn real money than to spend the enormous amount of time it takes to unlock all the content for free. It's not a cheap game in that respect, but doing the math shows it's a no-brainer with a game with such a high entertainment value.  For some perspective on my opinion, I am: -A proessional high-level auto mechanic -I've spent about $150 on War Thunder -I'm a lawful gun owner -I've done some amatuer gunsmithing that has proven to be safe and reliable",

Yes, timed puzzles and getting top scores are hard, but only if you are not into guns. Once you know how gun works in general and can distinguish what certain parts do and where they go this game becomes much easier than it looks (except for the russian tank, this thing is undoable).  PS. About the reviews saying that this game will help you surviving zombie apocalypse / war, Spoiler:    it won't    It skips the things like maintaining the gun, and even when you know how to disassemble certain weapon, without some knowledge you still won't know which part is broken and need a replacement.

I don't consider myself to be a firearm enthusiast, but I do enjoy going to the range every so often, and thought this would be a great way for me to learn how a firearm works. And it does.  However the whole 'Freemium' Free-To-Play model REALLY turns me off. Sure you can gain experience slower, and poke friends to play to unlock stuff - but I'm not interested in these things; I don't play Facebook 'Farmville' like games. I'd rather pay $15 (MAYBE $20) for a FULL game where I don't have to pester for friend invites. $50 though? That's asking way too much for what this game is.  Also the 'need to be online' is another turnoff - this game could be fully playable offline.  Great concept, enjoyed the actual game, but crap execution. Would rather pay $15-$20 for an actual retail game. The Free-To-Play model here really kills what could be a potentially good &amp; enjoyable game.",

            "review_text": "This game is amazing for both entertainment and educational purposes. It's perfect in every way, save for a few flaws. The only issue, is that the flaws are extraordinary in comparison to the pro's. Not only is it basically a grindathon if you rather not put money into microtransactions, but you must have a certain number of friends (which number increases the more you unlock.) in order to play the shooting range courses.. The most entertaining PART of the game, may I add. (No pun intended.) I'd rather have paid at least 10 US Dollars for this game and have the whole thing to myself, rather than have it contain microtransactions and friend-poking. I can't believe I'm saying this, but I hope they make it a retail game soon, as that might remove the microtransaction and friend-needing element. The experience system is neat, as to challenge yourself to beat new difficulties in order to progress, but grinding does not equal challenge. It equals impatience and disinterest. And if you even try to repeat beaten game modes (Disassemble/Reassemble/Operate/Field Strip, etc.) the experience count you get for completion is laughable at best.  For operate, (COLT 1911.) I got 200 experience, repeated, it gives me a whopping 5. With the wallet-tease 'IF YOU HAD A BOOSTER, YOU'D GET A WHOLE 12.5 EXTRA EXPERIENCE POINTS!!!!!111!!1oneoneoneeleveneleventy! JUST PAY US!' If you wont take my review seriously due to the time I've invested in the game already, it's because the curve the game grants you from 'Hey! Welcome to Facebook, Guns edition!' to 'PAY US PLZ!' is a mere half an-hour if you really are into it. Two guns, out of the hundreds available, are unlocked for me right now. With the MP5 within 300 experience points away. The only options I have to get these points are to spend money, or beat a 'Super-Game' (Disassemble/Reassemble perfectly with no double-clicks or flaws while timed.)  At the moment, and I hate to say this, because Firearms are an extreme hobby of mine, is I do not reccommend this game at this current state, floppy connections, friend-bugging neccessities, and pay-to-win ruined it for that giant elated smile I had on my face when I hit 'Play'.  On another plus side, I got to dis/reassemble a human skeleton. Which was cool. Sadly I have to pay credits to play the Car assembly, Motorcycle assembly, and the rest of the Skeletal assembly games. I guess I'm alright with the AK-47 and the COLT 1911. for now.   I will change my review as this game has hefty updates. Thank you.",

Yes, the bad part is that you have to grind for XP to unlock new weapons and the weapon tree is not fully visible, unless you pay. But guess what? This is a free game and you can play free for as long as you want. Most of the guns are availabe without having to pay. I don't mind the XP grind since I haven't paid a cent yet, nor did I feel the need to do so. The people who made the game, have to get paid somehow, so I don't mind the microtransactions.",

            "review_text": "World of Guns: Gun Disassembly. A very simple game for those who love firearms or want to know more about firearms.  This is not really a game where you have fun compared to shooters or simulators or simulators that are made for the lolz. This game is educational or an easy 3D source material for those who make replicas, fix guns etc.  The game starts well. It tells you how the game works and what you can do in a very straightforward manner. The rules are simple. You unlock a model, play the game modes, unlock achievements and receive xp to unlock the next model.  The game modes are: field strip, disassembly, assembly, operation, game, supergame and hardcore mode. Field strip- you field strip the weapon Disassembly- you take the weapon completely apart Assembly- you put the firearm back together Operation- you fire the weapon, reload it and customize it Game- you disassemble the weapon and assemble the weapon as fast as you can (there are 3 achievements. Timed I is easy, Timed II is medium and Timed III is hard) Super game- Like game mode but harder. If you click on the wrong part you lose and you have to restart from scratch. Hardcore mode- you can make more moves. Example: when playing HC mode with an AK47 you can take the magazine, cleaning rod, top cover, pistol and the cleaning kit apart (located in the stock) in a few seconds. To unlock the hardcore achievement you must take your gun apart and assemble it flawlessly. You can not take things apart instantly. For example if you remove the magazine on some guns you can not remove another part while the magazine is being taken out. You have to wait for the animation to end in order to take another part apart or when putting parts back together.  There are also shooting ranges where you shoot weapons and gain xp but you need xp to unlock them. In shooting ranges you are given a task to shoot X targets X ammount of times with X ammount of rounds. The reloading animations look robotic in my opinion but they are better than tacky animations. Its another game mode but if you want to unlock all of the guns then you might think about avoiding them but unlocking shooting ranges is also good because you can gain xp from them and possibly get credits from them on the first try (if your final score is good enough you might be the top scoring player of the day and receive 1 credit).  And then there is Quiz. When playing Quiz you are given an image of a firearm and you have to pick the right answer. Sounds easy but if you are not familiar with alot of firearms you are gonna have a hard time because if you pick the wrong answer the quiz is over, you get 0xp and you have to wait 1 hour in order to take the quiz again. So the best way to play this is to memorize the models or print an image list. If you dont know the answer then the best option is to do nothing because something is better then nothing.  There is also bonus content where you can take cars, motorcycles and skeletons apart. The human skeleton is free but the rest is not. Which brings me to xp and credits.  The more guns you unlock the more xp you need to unlock the next model. Now you get a decent ammount of xp for playing the game modes but after unlocking the achievements you get less but depending on the model and the ammount of xp it requires you get more xp (a 16000xp model will give you more xp compared to a 10000xp model). Credits can be earned if you unlock the champion achievement (you can unlock it by topping the scorebored in the Day section. There is also Week and All time. Theres also highscores for each game mode. And if you lack the ability to think the Day section will show you the top scoring players of the day and yes the scoreboard resets). You also get free xp for playing the game the day after so the game is not that cruel. But if you lack patients you can buy a booster pack which doubles your xp or you can buy credits or xp with your money. 1.99 € for 5000 xp. You can also buy DLC to unlock everything but I have not looked that up very well so yeah you can simply buy all of the models for 50€. While that kinda sounds like a P2E (pay to enjoy) you can get all the models for free if you play casually. Casually playing is mini grinding and playing Quiz. When you have enough xp you unlock the model you want to unlock, have fun with it and start mini grinding and playing Quiz until you get the next one.  Graphics- since my settings are set to low to get a lot of fps. I am not going to judge but it looks fine. Not super realistic but good for an educational game.  Music and backround art- the music is fine but the backrounds are not. In my opinion the default backround is the best for me cus the space backrounds look cheesy. If you like the space backrounds go ahead and use em. What ever floats your boat keep it floating.  Pros: educational, no major glitches, fun animations when taking the weapons apart, free and alot of models to check out. Cons: due to the ammount of xp you need you will grind at one point or another and it does take a while to unlock a new model.  Tips: when taking firearms apart while trying to get the best time disable auto focus in the settings. Leave it on in disassembly and assembly mode for ease of learning.  Overall the game is fine. Its not a mega fun blast. Its educational. 7.5/10",

There is a reassmebly mode and then there are 3 different game modes that require you to do a full disassemble and reassemble while being timed with bonuses for not clicking any of the wrong pieces among others. This game has a large and beautiful catalog of guns to choose from. Everything from Mauser to Glock as well as Beretta, Colt, AK variants, Heckler and Koch, Fabrique Nationale, Walther and many others.  This is a fantastic game for any gun enthusiast. It will make you a lot more knowledgeable about the guns and how they break down. You can also see an x-ray view of how the gun works in real time or slow motion while it is in operation.   If that isn't enough you can also fire guns off at firing ranges as you unlock them. (You must unlock guns as well as ranges) One downfall to this is that it doesn't let you choose which gun to use at the range. The ranges have 4 games which are preset to certain guns.  In the end I don't think there is much to complain about. The game is free, and it has tons of guns. You can compete for high scores with other players and friends. You can learn about all of the parts of the guns, and you can even select an option that allows you to see the names of each and every part.  If you love guns, get this game. You won't regret it.   I own a beretta 92FS and I will say the break down of the gun in the game is 100% accurate to the real thing. Every spring, every pin, every screw. Perfect to a fault.    Rating: 10/10",

After a few hours turning them around seeing how everything works I went for the DLC with the unlimited guns. The M-16 A1 model brought back not-so-fond memories of skinning my knuckles trying to pull out the handguards. I also noticed that the o-rings in the bolt are stacked exactly like in real life, it's obvious that these models went through an insane amount of scrutiny.   What's good:  1. You get to see how most of everything inside works. 2. You get to fire the weapons.  What's not so good:  1. The full weapons unlock should allow hiding all new guns and click to show/hide guns as needed so it is not so damn hard to navigate. It is overwhelming when you see all of the guns up to date displayed in one shot. 2. I wish I could use my controller in the shooting games. 3. The game doesn't explain things, it just walks you through. And sometimes the safeties can't be engaged by clicking on the weapon, you have to click a menu button. 4. Sometimes the fire selectors don't allow all positions, so you are also stuck using a menu button to select fire modes. 5. The only adjustable sight post that moves at all so far is the AK-47. The M16-A1s front post doesn't turn, unless I am doing something wrong.  6. Some weapons should allow movement of the hammer but the model only allows to pull back the slide.   Wish list for the developers:  1. Allow show/hide of items already purchased/unlocked/etc.  2. Allow a visualization of the return mechanism, for example the M16-A1 should show me the gas blow back, etc. 3. Allow sights to move if/when the originals do.  4. Explain a little bit more of what's going on.  5. All safeties, fire selectors, de-cocking levers, etc. should be movable from the model, not from menu buttons.   BTW, hats off to the parties responsible for the game mode achievement for doing things in the right order. It's frustrating as hell, but these being dangerous machines it makes sense to force people to learn an assembly sequence. I have been busting my ♥♥♥ for two long miserable days trying to do the Colt 1911 in order and I keep screwing up because I pick the main spring out of sequence or I click the recoil spring plug when I wanted to click on the recoil spring, that kind of thing.   Overall:  A complete absolute win for anyone that is curious about how machines work. The first time you dig into that AK-47 and you figure out on your own why the auto mode works, you'll feel like a rocket scientist.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR : It's not as bad as everyone says, just look at it like a puzzle game and don't expect it to move too fast.  I play a lot of FPS, or at least I used to, and in that time I always wondered a bit how the virtual guns I was using to pwn all the noobs in town actually worked. Being financially challenged and completely unmotivated to get the permits to own these guns, this wonder was set aside.  That's when I saw World of Guns. 'A gun simulator where I can take apart guns to see how they work?' I said. 'What's the catch?' The catch is that it's free-to-play, and that comes with all of the normal trappings of free-to-play games. Several other reveiws have been comparing this to a Facebook game for a good reason; lots of grinding, lots of repitition, lots of soft paywalls, and there's even incentives to invite your friends to play.  The game itself is rather enjoyable and novel, and is about what it says on the tin. You disassemble, then reassemble, a firearm. The amount of guns there are is staggering. Name any gun from any modern-military FPS you know of; it's in the game, and you can take it apart, and even see how the parts work together while it's firing. You unlock the first few guns quickly, but the cost of guns later on increases, and the only way to gain more currency is through repetition. If you're looking to shoot actual things, there are firing ranges, but they're far from the main attraction and probably shouldn't be what you're spending your time looking at.  The repetition itself isn't too terrible. By the time you're forced to start repeating builds to get more currency, you've a decent selection of guns to play with, and each gun has it's own set of achievements to complete that help you earn currency. These achievements are repeateable, but subsequent completions don't give you as much cash as the first. The achievements range from simple completion to speed-run awards, and even reward you for having the best time on the ladder for the day.  When playing, it may be better to see the game as a thematic, informative speed puzzle centered around guns. I've gotten quite a bit of enjoyment with this mindset and have killed several hours of time this way. However, as the cost of guns rises, it may become less and less feasible to continue playing, but it depends on your level of involvement.  I reccomend only to people who think guns are neat and/or like to do fast-paced puzzles.",

If you get this game, (It's free so why wouldn't you?), you will need to take into account that you cannot expect to complete this overnight (unless you pay £30 for the full unlocks). You could complete 3 or 4 weapons within the first day, but after that the exp costs of weapons starts to rise, and as repeating games nets you only 10% of the exp, you will have to count on gaining most exp through quiz's (every two hours) and daily rewards.  Some bad things about this game would be you require 10 friends who play to unlock shooting ranges, invite 5 friends who don't play and get them to play the game for an achievement and exp.

It's really interesting to see the differences and similarities between various designs from different ages and cultures--I have a newfound respect for Russian guns and a newfound hatred for German guns (why use two parts to do a job when you can use eighteen parts to do the same thing instead!), being able to trace design elements on the Desert Eagle back to the Jericho and then the CZ-75, how Ruger's copy of the Colt SAA is in many ways more complicated, etc. All of this is pretty interesting to me.  But then again I'm a nerd about these things.   I like the 'operation' mode too, where you can see how the gun functions using varying levels of transparency and slow motion. It's all fantastically polished, especially being free to play.  Not perfect though. As another reviewer mentioned, while the game requires you to remove and install parts in the proper order and shows animations of the various screws and pins, it leaves something to be desired as far as the actual method goes-- there's a difference between clicking on a 1911's recoil spring vs. slipping and sending the spring and plug across the room when you turn the barrel bushing, for example. So in its current form the educational aspects are limited, but I see a lot of potential there.  All in all, though, it's a heck of a lotta fun.",

Well this version of the game requires me to REBUY the items I have previously bought. Which is funny since the PC application of Gun Disassembly allows me to download my purchases I bought. If you’re new to this world of disassembly apps &amp; games, get this game but be ready to spend an arm and a leg in two weeks.

Then on top of that, there's literally banners featuring their DLC for this game. At first, I thought I'd give this EXP system a go, but then it instantly backfired on me because the tutorial was forcing me to do 'games' with said AK-47 where I'd have to COMPLETELY disassemble the ENTIRE weapon as fast as I could with no hints. Must I remind you that this was litearlly no more than 30 minutes of gameplay before they instantly expected me to remember how to completely disassemble the weapon and do it as fast as possible. This was just a nightmare for me because they added in EVEN MORE PARTS TO DISASSEMBLE, WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE CONFUSED. Oh, and did I mention that the AK-47 is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to disassemble? If it were with the pistol, I would have been A LOT more comfortable, but no, they just HAD to stick me with the hardest weapon in the game to disassemble.  Look, if you're a guns expert and are too poor to buy real games on Steam, then this is the PERFECT game for you. If you're a casual gamer who knows a FEW things about guns, then no, go away, you're going to have a ♥♥♥♥ing brain injury before you're done finishing this game. Maybe it's because I'm impatient, but I'd rather have every single weapon there and already unlocked so that I could just shoot them, disassemble them, play with them on the fly instead of going through their 10 hour long tutorial and having to waste even more time on the exact same weapons that I've already got done with just to unlock more weapons.",

With slowmotions and xrays and 'ghost parts' you can learn every detail, in as slow as 1/50 of real speed.  Some parts of the game can be frustrating since they want you to dissaselmbe in a somethimes wierd order for what you'd be doing in real life(in my experiance)  If you just go by the free parts of the game, unlocking new firearms take quite a bit of time, but by the time you've mastered the firearms you have acces to, I'm comfident to say you could with a very small degree of diffaculty do it with a real firearm too.  You migth want to spend a few dollars on a DLC , but if you like the game, it's worth it.  So if you are a aboow avrage gun nut(Firearms entusiast) I would reccomed this game highly.  I give it a 87% score, based upon some clunky animations on the shooting range, the lack of trademarks on some firearms and weird parts of some weapons(the mp5 is the only one i've rly noticed this on so far) And the lack of GREAT grapichs, But this migth change since it's somewhat in a beta for the time being (late sept 2014)  and it's free (if you don't need the dlc's or shortcuts)",

My only wish is, that the developers update every gun to the same standard. Some guns (as of now) are a bit lacking in detail like the SVD.  Note: If the ITAR amendment comes through and it's being interpreted like some fear it could be (like the 'worst possible scenario') this game would be THE most illegal game on steam by far, so better get it while you can!

There are some things I myself would like to see added to this game, I know they do have an old flintlock pistol dating back to somewhere in the 1700's but I would like to see some more musket and old styled guns popping up if it's possible. Another thing I would wonder if possible to add would be war planes and ships (WW1 era to present.)  Again those are just some stuff I think would make the game a bit more interesting, but even if those items are never included I would say this game is by far the best out there, and not only would I recommend it for how fun it is, but also that it's a game that ranks well in the top of some pay to play games out there and it's free to play.

Its very straightforward, take apart the gun, put it back together, shoot it and play around with its features, and do the more difficult modes and quizzes to rack up points to get the next gun. Its very simple, but surprisingly addicting.  Some problems I have with it is the fact the game is somewhat picky in the order you disassemble the gun. After a while, you just kind of accept it, but it is a pain to see that you failed one of your attempts at 'super game mode' just because you didn't take a part out of the gun the way you would have in real life. Still, it adds to the challenge of it being a memory game, despite the tradeoff of realism. But honestly unless you are an OCD gunsmith or armorer or someone like Larry Vickers, I don't see this as being much of a problem. Also the amount of information on each given firearm is not always consistent, some guns seem to have an entire essay written about them while the others are just a few paragraphs long. All are ripped off of Wikipedia, which i have no problem with, but I would have liked the developers to write about the weapons in their own words.(thats just me) Graphics leaves some room for improvement, but i honestly can't complain that the graphics don't rival games of a major big budget franchise as it is free. I've read some technical difficulties, but I personally haven't experienced any. Perhaps they patched it all up. More reason for you to get it right?   All in all, I recommend it. If you are a firearms nut, then its an absolute must in your library.",

I can have a 1911 stripped and ready to be cleaned in less than a minute. This game will force you to do everything in a certain way even though some operations are completely independent of eachother, thus gimping your ability to efficiently reassemble and strip something. (Which is why it took me 6 minutes on the 1911 of dinking around meta-gaming trying to figure out which part they want you to touch next before you can move on)  On top of all this, some of the weapon parts aren't even textured. Why would I even consider giving these devs a dime when they can't even be bothered to at least color the object a darker grey instead of '3D modeling program generic gun metal grey 5.'  To further gimp itself, the game is the king of microtransactions. Any chance to suck money out of you, it will try to. On top of that, the god awful super long tutorial teaches you nothing except to spam space while simultaneously slamming your finger on the mouse while it's hovering over 'hint.' Why isn't there a free mode where I can check out any weapon I want, why is there a loading screen between disassembly and reassembly? Why do I have to download each gun from the server instead of having it all downloaded with the game?   This is pay2win, not F2p.   0/10.

There are 'quizzes' that happen every 60 mintues, where you must correctly name guns that are shown on the screen, and they give more experience than the assembly games oddly.  Without that, I wouldn't have unlocked 2 guns, at which point I ran out of experience. I could do quizzes, but it'd probably take a few months before I'd earn enough to unlock all the guns.  Seeing every single tiny screw in a gun isn't enough fun to warrant a $50 price tag, you should probably spend the money on another game, and though it's free to play I would suggest most any other F2P over this one.",

First and foremost, this game will actually make you think and you will learn a lot about the inner workings of guns.

But give it a try! Even if you just spend an hour on the first gun (the AK47), you are guaranteed to get something out of it.",

Now, after some couple of dissassemble and re-assemble AK-47 (as it is the first weapon we are working for the first time) I acknowledge the components.. :)  What I hate is.. umm.. it's hard to beat the 1st rank in the high score.. :D :D  Patient, precision, strategy, and experience.

It's the perfect thing to have if you want to learn exactly how guns work, or how to possibly make them. You can also show it to someone else when you're introducing them to shooting. A beginner would feel much more comfortable and confident when they know exactly what's going on in their hands during that split-second when they squeeze the trigger.   Anyway, it's a really good game, it's free, so what have you got to lose?? Check it out! It's really great if you're interested in actually learning how guns function (or you could just go back to listening to those stupid politicians that keep calling magazines clips). I won't force you anyhow, learning is fun when no one makes you do it. ;)   However I have only two cons, like the sound. For instance, on some guns they make the superficial 'quiet' sound when you put on a suppressor. The other con is how you don't exactly have complete total freedom when playing in operation mode (and this game is supposed to be all about freedom amirite?), like how you can't put an extra round in the chamber, or you can't reload a shotgun when it still has some rounds in it (hey man, details matter).   Those two tiny insignificant cons are all I have to complain about, besides those, this game is really cool and I highly recommend you check it out.  Note to Devs: It would be REALLY cool if we could see detailed x-rays of the cartridges as well! There's a few things going on inside those little firecrackers that would be neat to see, like the primer being punched and the gunpowder bursting into flames! (ok it doesn't have to be THAT detailed, you know what I mean)  In conclusion, I rate this game 9.9 freedoms out of 10. Have a good day and God bless America. :)",

I'm disappointed by the pay system, and the lack of being able to shoot every gun at the ranges i paid for.  If you just want to take apart guns, for only 49.95 you can take apart over 100 guns, and put them back together. you can also reload and fire the gun in a simulation mode similar to something you'd see on history channel. sounds thrilling to you? go ahead. i'll never pay 50 bucks for that!  i may change my mind when the shooting range is completely available to all guns. FINALLY, the game is low res, and the shooting mechanics at the range are miffy.

You must break-down and then piece each gun back together in a fashion that I find to be, quite frankly, stupid.
