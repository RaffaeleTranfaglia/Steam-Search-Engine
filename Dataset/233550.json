As a narrative experience is a complete masterpiece, an art piece in bits, with an exquisite design, setting, action and scenes. As a game its major flaws is the lack of response in the control, understandable by the time, but not in this re-edition, that can become a very frustrating experience, and more than once would make you want to throw the whole PC through the windows. The comic like level design also force you to do exactly as the developers thought in order to complete an scene, so basically no level of freedom here. Even if you die 10,000 times like me, it won’t last for more than 3 hours, so you should definitely give it a try.",

It is random, never at the same point in the game, but it is very annoying nonetheless. It ruins the immersion. And I don't see any follow-up work, like patching, so this game isn't being actively maintained. The game itself is a unique experience and one that I would recommend, but this port is faulty.

Still, it stayed in my mind for quite some time.  After finally playing the 20th edition I must say it should be required gaming by anyone at least once. It's completely worth it and it was so ahead of it's time it's not even funny. The atmosphere needs to be experienced to be believed. The art, the animations and the HD graphics all mesh together into a picture that speaks louder than words. It also has a killer soundtrack and sound effects that complements it, and a basic, yet addictive and satisfying gun mechanic. The only bad part is that it's too quiet throughout the game because there's barely any music.  I would still wait for a sale though. After your first playthrough you will play it again but you will finish it around 30 mins. It's too damn short. Simply there's no incentive to go back to it. Everything is exactly the same and you will feel that all you're doing is repeating the same actions. Even in hard mode is still mostly the same with only a few extra surprises. I really wish the game was deeper and longer, with added music for the stages like the console versions and it would've been perfect. ",

The story is simple but engaging, you are trapped on another world surrounded by all kinds of peril and you'll want to escape, along with your buddy.

I feel, however, that after 1.8 hours I've seen as much as I need to of the janky controls, horrible combat, and all around mediocrity of this fossil.  Don't get me wrong, I respect how original and revolutionary this game was, I really do. I completely understand why it recieved such a following in 1991. It's cinematic storytelling style was incredibly interesting at the time. This having been said, it's not aged well. The story (at least the first couple hours) is shallow and not especially gripping. The controls are awkwardly designed, almost as if they were restricted to only using 2 buttons and the arrow keys to do everything they wanted. The core mechanics are unintuitive, the combat is as aweful and irritating as it is frequent, and the platforming is highly disinteresting.  On top of this, the 20th anniversary edition offers an 'HD' graphics mode that actually makes the game look worse. The walk cycle looks weird and broken, the backgrounds look extremely unpolished (sometimes even unfinished), and weird sprite layering issues which aren't visible with the original graphics (because of the limited colour palette) become painfully clear. I'd heard that this update of the game contributed little of value to the original work, but I wasn't expecting this truly pathetic display. It looks alright in the screenshots, but believe me when I say that when it's fullscreen and things are moving it looks horrible. That's probably why there's no video on the store page.  TL:DR An interesting peice of gaming history that is probably better kept in a museum.",
