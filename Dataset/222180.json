That fact aside, Pros: This game is one of the best optimised pc games ever,the graphics are phenominal,the gameplay is very solid,and the challenge level is fair. Cons:music is recyled from the spore wars and the keyboard controls are a bit confusing. All in all,if you even remotley like puzzle platformers,this should definitley be a game you should play! My score:9/10",
