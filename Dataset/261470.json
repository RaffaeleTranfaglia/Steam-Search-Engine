            "review_text": "This is, hands down, the most complex 4x I ever played. And I've been playing it since the first release, back when it was only Distant Worlds (this version has four, I think, expansions already integrated) It does things differently from others, and this is a very good thing. Let me explain  The most notable thing is the existence of the civilian sector. Unlike most 4x, you aren't a god, you control the state, but not the people and you really need the peoplet to sustain your empire and, thus, must protect them and nurture them so that your tax base grows. Though it is a bit more complex than that.  The first thing you have to understand is that resources? there are lots of those in game, and came in three cathegories, Strategic, Luxury and Super. Strategic are needed to keep your warmachine going, Luxury enhance the value of your civilians helping their planets grow faster and more devoped (and thus more profitable), supers are technically luxury as in that they are used by your civilians but they have profound effects, are very rare, expensive and desireable that I generally put them appart (specially since all empires can restrict the trading of these resources to other empires). Not all planets, asteroids, nevula and what not have all resources, so it si important to have multiple mines thoughout your territory and beyond to feed your industrial might. Not only this allows you to deepen your stockpiles, buti t also lowers the price of the resource in question, which in turn lowers the cost of components that contain that resource .  Ship components are manufactured from the Strategic resources, it is not abstracted, and generally needs several resources, in different quantities, to produce a single components.  Because of this the logistics of the game are complex, but it is generally of little immediate concern to the player, you aren't going to be manually moving resources, the traders are for that (so you better protect our mines, miners and trade ships) and do so more or less automatically, of course, scarcity of the resource modifies its price, and therefore a component might be made cheaper by having multiple mines.  Speaking of which here is where the game shines, see, because you need to protect the civilian sector, the mines and the trade ships you need more than the battleline, you also need cheap, inexpensive and discardable escorts to police your inner lines both from imperial raiders and pirates. Spaking of which, it is important to note that this means war is more complex than throwing your fleets at the enemy. You have to protect the homefront too.  Or, if the enemy is more dangerous than you and can't fight it head on, you can try to collapse his economy by raiding his soft underbelly or by hiring pirates to do the raiding for you, you can even do that in peace time, but of course, you might just get found out.   Speaking of pirates, dealing with them can be complicated. using them as proxy might be tampting, but they aren't the most loyal of folks, and letting them grow too large might be... unwise.  The game has several modes, but have a basic divide you can be a normal empire or a pirate nation, this changes how you play the game significantly as they have completely different playstyles. As a Normal empire, you can start at different levels of development, from pre-warp all the way to being an already stablished star nation. I love Pre-warp start, it is impressive seeing the little ships puttering on your starting system, as you develop and industralize it, turning it into the cornerstone of your empire  While you can micro everything, the AI is reasonable and generally does a good job, though as of late I prefer to contorl where the mines get built to make it easier on my navy.  Thing is, this is not a game for everybody. It is dificult, demanding and expensive. The art and interphase could be better, but it is functional and do their jobs well enough. But it is, hands down, the most ambitious demanding and complete 4x I ever played. Worth every penny to me.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to start this off with the obligatory, this game isn't for everyone. But for me, this game is the ultimate 4x space sim.   Many people complain about the price of the game, that it's just too high. I sympathize, I would be very upset if that prevented my from owning/playing the game. The reality is, this game has tons of content and accomodates tons of play styles. I've put in nearly 500 hours and still feel like there's a bunch of things that I still have to experience.  My main draw to the game is its scope. The size of the universe (at the largest setting) is simply astonishing. This is the only space sim (next to elite dangerous) that really captures the immense size of the universe. This has essentially ruined Galactic Civilizations for me. I played GalCiv2 to death but have found GalCivIII very hard to get into now that I've been spoiled by DWU.   DWU is a simulation first, game second. Much like Crusader Kings 2 and Europa Universalis IV, you can just let the computer AI manage your empire's decisions. DWU has an incredible amount of options regarding what aspects of the empire you want to control so it's up to you to decide. I find that starting as a prewarp empire is essential when getting into the game initially. It reduces the early game scope to what most players are familiar with: exploration, finding critical resources and developing some crucial early technologies that allow you to expand and defend your empire.  The visual presentation is very utilitarian. The menus are probably the weakest visual element, but some other aspects of the game are gorgeous. I think the late game galaxy view is a sight to behold. So many moving parts bring an incredible amout of life to the game, something you don't get in GalCivIII or any of game I've played for that matter.  The ship graphics can be modded, but it's a relatively basic 2d representation. Managing large battles can be challenging when ships overlap, but I have not had to many problems in that regard. I still prefer the 2d presentation which allows for the massive scale over the more limited 3d turn based views of GalCivIII.   The game also allows you to play as a pirate faction which can be a very fun experience, it's more intimate. You also have the ability to custom build/upgrade your own ships. You can have the AI do this, but that takes a huge strategical element out of the game. I'm finding that I like to micro manage this process more and more.  This game is one of those rare games that will age (and has aged) very well. The game mechanics are solid and the simulation is just stellar. By focusing on those core elements and not so much on the visual side, we have a product that is in a category of it's own. I understand that some people won't get over the price premium and put way more emphasis on the visual side of things, but I think they are missing the point of what this game ultimately achieves. For them I recommend GalCivIII (which I enjoy playing), but I will be turning to DWU to scratch my Space 4X itches most of the time. Highly recommended. ",

            "review_text": "Distant Worlds seems real cool, at first; but then, after a while, you realize that the AI is not playing by the same rules as you. Not by a long shot.  The AI will often field a gigantic space fleet, even if they still only have their homeworld because they're too incompetent to colonize another planet. You have to pay maintenance, which limits the size of your fleet; apparently, the AI does not.  Let's say you start as a pre-warp empire, and all your AI opponents do, too. After you discover warp drive and explore the galaxy a bit, you'll find that some of your opponents just sit on their homeworlds forever and don't expand, while others expand impossibly fast and will have 10 times or more the colonies you do. The first couple games, you think that they expand so much faster than you because you are new to the game and don't know what you're doing. The next couple games, when you understand how the game works better, and they still expand absurdly faster than you, you realize that it's not you, it's the AI cheating. A lot.  After a while of playing this, I began to get the impression that the AI empires are there just to harrass and annoy the player, rather than actually try to win. For example, you might have this space empire of around 10 colonies; then the AI empire next to you that consists of only it's homeworld decides to embargo your homeworld. They send their impossibly huge fleet to surround your homeworld. How could they think they could get away with this? You're 10 times bigger than they are. Well, their fleet is almost as big, or maybe even bigger, than yours, because they cheat horribly; but why don't they just declare war on you, then? This action doesn't help them in any way; you get the impression they have no motivation except to annoy those they don't like.  Once war starts, the AI will throw fleets at you. Over and over and over. And will invade the same planet again and again and again, which is nigh impossible to stop, even with a huge fleet guarding the planet. Really, the AI worlds are just spawn points for hordes of ships which they throw at you; even though they will build mining stations, I suspect they don't even have to worry about resources like you do. It might seem like a crazy comparison, but after a while, I began to feel like I was playing Gauntlet (the old coin op, as in 'green elf needs food, badly') instead of a 4X strategy game.  Look, I've been playing 4X games for years. I realize that making a decent AI for these types of games is an immense challenge. However, the AI in this game is so bad, and cheats so blatantly, they're really just not very fun opponents. Considering that there's no multiplayer, it renders the entire game a pointless waste of time. ",

            "review_text": "I cannot recommend this game without significant reservations. For many people, this game may be ideal, but most people, even most 4X fans, will find it features too much micromanagement with a weak interface.  Distant Worlds is a 4X space game in the mold of Master of Orion and similar games. It simulates building a space empire including setting up trade, mining asteroids, designing and building your own ships, diplomacy, exploration, and such. That's a lot of tasks and all of them, to some degree, are interesting. The problem is they all come at once.   Take mining. You can mine nearly every planet, moon, and asteroid belt in the game. This is important because mining provides valuable resources. A large system may have over a dozen mining points in it. That's fine and all, but that's a lot of mining potential and you receive an alert every time your mining station is attacked. By what I would consider mid-game, once I've more or less completed my initial expansion and now press up against other empires, I have scores of mining stations. Mining as a whole is important, but any single mining station isn't particularly valuable. Thankfully, the AI automation is very good at setting up new mining systems so you don't need to manually send out your mining units.   However, the alert system is not so nuanced. I receive alerts for every attack on every mining station. Little information is provided on these reports and they come in fast and furious. I can't tell from an alert whether this is a single pirate destroyer skirmishing on the frontier or the initial attack of an alien armada aimed at my home system. If you click on an alert you should be sent to the area in question, but the game doesn't change the zoom level. Watching an attack on a single mining station isn't particularly useful at the galaxy zoom level. Consider that I am getting a ton of these alerts every minute of the game and the alert system becomes unworkable.   The same can be said about nearly every other system in the game: good AI for automation (probably the best I've ever seen in a 4X game), but poor human interface. Of course once you get used to the AI, which will intelligently colonize planets, choose tech goals, and automate other high-level tasks (and can be turned off or overridden if you want to perform those tasks yourself), you will become frustrated by what the AI doesn't do.  Why the AI can intelligently choose a planet for a colony but wouldn't build planet infrastructure or critical star ports is beyond me.   Probably some of my complaints could be salved through setting up AI priorities and adjusting other settings in the game, but I'll be damned if I can find the right screens to do that. The interface is just complex and obtuse.  If you are interested in an innovative space 4x with great AI automation then maybe you should give this game a try. I can't recommend it straight out because it can be really frustrating to work with. Maybe you will enjoy it, but be warned.  ",

            "review_text": "Distant Worlds is a 4X unlike any other, and is unmatched in its variety, gameplay and complexity. Don't let the complexity scare you though. Thanks to intelligent automation, Distant Worlds can be as simple or as complex as you want. Only want to deal with one ship or a fleet? Fine, automate everything except a ship and explore like it was a spaceship game. Only want to deal with ship building? Fine, you can set that to manual and everything else to automated. Want to have advisers suggest certain courses of action, but leave the details to the AI? You can do that too! The galaxies in Distant Worlds are teeming with life, and there's always something out there to discover.   Thanks to an amazing amount of races (even more with modding) and an exceptional amount of game setup options -- including an in-game editor to make changes on the fly -- no two games will ever be alike. If you're looking for a 4X game that makes you feel like an emperor rather than a micromanager, or if you want, a ship builder rather than an emperor or, if you want, and admiral rather than a ship builder, then Distant Worlds is for you. I've played nearly every 4X there is, and this is my all-time favorite.",

I played this game a while back and I really really wanted to buy it, but I'm pretty much a Steam or GTFO guy these days because I like my collection in one place. Also their pricing was a bit crazy, and I know the price for this looks high, but wait for a sale or shop around if you must...but know the original with all the xpansions was an even bigger investment. This is a deal compared to that.  Now as far as the game? This is the game for control freaks that just can't have enough data and control at their fingertips in a space 4x. It's a giant onion and you start peeling it to find more game. Some will cry tears of joy and others will just cry. I won't lie to you, it's a very heavy game to get into and for some people (like me) that's a very good thing, but if you are not the type to want to learn and fumble around for I dunno.. at least a few dozen hours before everything sinks in then I'd grab up Endless Space if you are looking for CiV in space or even Sins of A Solar Empire if you want something that's a bit more combat/RTS oriented. Or if you are looking for the substantial 'a lot more to it' upgrade to that kind of game then dive on in, but I can't really use words to describe how much really goes on in this game at one time, yet still feels managble. It's a remarkable accomplishment as a game and has been vastly underknown for the past few years that it's been out.",

            "review_text": "Ok. I was pretty excited for this game after watching videos about it and researching it before it became available on steam. After I purchased this I was still suprised at the sheer complexity and learning curve this game requires.  I tried watching the AI and that didn't work, so I started a new game and tried to micro, learning by pain. It was slow and painful. But I did learn a few things. I had to turn AI back on on almost everything and it slowly became more enjoyable. I blew it on the economy though and lost my colony, losing the game. (my 3rd game)  So for this initial review and first impressions I would say that it is a buy IF you want to dedicate yourself to learning this game in and out to be effective. I am enjoying it, although the very first impression was a WTF moment.   This game could really use a streamline of the research trees (more detailed discriptions and easier to find que). Alot more streamlining of the UI would realy help a ton and make this into the gem that is obviously there after a few playthroughs. Its hard to remember which screen has this hidden thing to fix another hidden thing. ack.  If you are buying this game dont be scared to experiment to find the 'fun' setting that seems to work for you in regards to speed, era, etc. Every game seems unique after the initial starting phase.  I recommend this game. I hope to update this after I learn more. Learning this game is a *hefty* investment.  EDIT 1: Ok, I have played a few games. This game is huge, and requires alot of micro to get the full enjoyment out of it.  Pros : Feels live, there is always something to do, time will pass quickly. You feel like an emperor or diety in this game in a way, depending on your micro. The races are cool, and there are lots of them! Like someone said before, its facinating like a giant ant farm. It is FUN.  Cons: UI could use some combining/streamlining, Ships will sometimes bug out, and refuse to upgrade or move. (I had a full fleet that would not upgrade to hyperdrive, and was stuck at the planet for hours until I just ended the game).   Resource management is a real pain. (why cant I see which planet I am prioritizing, and where it is easily? Why does AI shoot for a far away system when mining where I have no control unless I micro, and get itself killed anyways?)  Ship design is a bit bleh.  So there are my impressions. Honestly though this game is hard, and time consuming. But it is fun.  for the price I am not sure it is a good buy. I just bought Galactic Civ II and played that alot. That is a much simpler game compared to this, by far. But for the price, Galactic Civ II is worth it( bout 8 hours played offline). I think this game is worth bout 40-45 bucks. But it is a really hard, (cause of resource management), dated, but in depth game. I do like it.  Quick Tip: Turn down the pirates, and make them destroyable in settings. It slows the pace of people attacking you left and right and bribes, making it much easier to learn.",

Many options can work with 'half-automation', so that the AI makes suggestions and don't control that aspect directly.  The technology tree is not too complicated, but leads to interesting new components. Technology is absolutely important.  Distant Worlds uses a wide variety of ressources, many of them needed as building materials for your ships and bases, but also luxury resources, which boosts the development of your colonies, which leads to higher taxes.  There are also some really good mods out there for the game. For example Human Revolution or W40k.

The size and scope and level of micromanagement possibilities are so refreshing in a genre and industry that tries to water everthing down and simplify things to ensure a larger playerbase (more profit). If you enjoy the complexity and scope of the Paradox grand strategy games and Civilization games, do yourself a favor and get this game.  For those that vehemently defend MOO2, yes it's one of the best games ever, but nostalgia bears no weight on my decision making and this game is objectively better, in that it is not limited by programming restricitons of the 90s. I love it too, but can we please stop defending 'our childhoods' (I was in the military when MOO2 came out)?",

I told my advisor to build 6 Exploration ships, and since they are completely automated, as soon as they were built, they went out and found many planets, moons, all with valuable resources to be mined, and a gas giant planet that had some Caslon. So I told my Construction Ship to build a gas mine there. As soon as it was built, the private sector decided to build a bunch of freighters, which they paid me for by the way. The private sector started hauling Caslon back to my home planet. I didn't have to do anything. The private secor handles it.  But some pirates came by and blew up my gas mine. Now I need to make some ships with lasers to patrol the Caslon source. The only problem is, I need Nekros Stone to build my lasers. And I don't have any of that either. My Nekros Stone mine got blown up too. So I need to design some new ships with railguns on them. I have the materials for those. In the meantime, I contacted some pirates who are supposed to be bringing me some Caslon.  Man, I'm in a bad way here. I need some Caslon.",

To be quite honest, I don't quite grasp the mechanics of the game. Sometimes it feels quite liberating that the denizens of your budding Empire of Seth go about their business, carrying out your instructions as they see fit, and sometimes it feels like you're trying to drive a car, but you have this nagging feeling that the steering wheel should be attached to the steering column, not drifting about your back seat. Alternatively, this game sometimes feels what I guess driverless cars will make you feel like when they finally become a feature.   So is it not a good game? Actually, it seems to be a tremendous game space based strategy game. And I've had some moderate success, but ultimately it is the kind of game I play for a day or two or three then put aside for another month or two before I return as Emperor of the Seth.   And I'm fine with that.   The game has depth. It needs some serious interactive expansive tutorials. It's realistic in that you literally are only a government, your people build and work on their own, your control is limited to governing and fleets. Refuelling sucks.   This game is good. If you like 4x Space strats, this one is a must have if you can afford to buy it.",

Not only do you have the complete power to micromanage every aspect of your empire, from the tiniest ship to major policy decisions, you have the option to let the computer handle any aspect you don't want to control. This creates a lot of flexibility for the player in experiencing the parts of the game that are the most fun for them and reinforces the idea that the empire is a living system that you direct through influence rather than a series of chess moves.  It controls in real time, and the resource, economy, military, and political systems are all very complex and there is always something to do. Each expansion has added tons of content, and with all of them available now, it stands out among other 4x for trying to innovate a stagnant genre. My only real criticism of the game is that it's very hard to understand the consequences of certain things, and diplomacy is pretty derivitave. If you are a fanatic of 4x space strategy games, I can actually reccommend this at full price. For anyone casually interested in the genre, I'd reccomend it on sale.",

The font is awful. Appears to be linked to screen monitor size, larger monitors worse. Seriously have to squint to make out the writing sometimes.  I'd kind of expect better for a full price game.. however the rest is full price.++  That out of the way, I'm really enjoying playing this so far. It's got heaps of automation, which I recommend you disable, which I did after getting my **** handed to me on a plate a couple of times on the first run throughs. Nothing like 3 hours play, then getting hold of a territory map and realising just how badly you've underperformed..  Pirates are super annoying, in a good way. Normal course of events is to pay them off, while concentrating on building up strength, and then wipe them out. It's a pain as when that happens they are all over you, until you can contain them, and they infest your systems with hidden bases. It's a good feature.  Nice selection of hidden kit lying around to provide storys and bonuses (ships, bases, tech) and interesting space terrain (nebulas that damage, or prevent hyperspace)  Graphics.. well hopefully the Devs can afford to get HD monitors sometime soon.. but game play makes up for it, as well as some nice galactic map features, so you can see your layout.  Economics.. bit confused by that in this game, run out of money, you can't build, but the totting up of income and expenses I have not figured out yet, it's probably there somewhere. Personally I would love for a 4x game to add some more realistic finance systems in place - inflation, defaults, loans etc. you could end up with empires that need to expand to keep strong etc.  In summary I bought this on a whim, and it seemed expensive, and I'd not seen any reviews produced.

If you still love it, you can mod into your own obsessive compulsive control freak paradise.  You could fall in love with this game. The attention to detail is staggering. The game will let you micromanage an empire spanning hundreds of stars over the course of several months. When you finally tweak the automation into submission you could play a game in a few hours. As you try to figure out the many systems and get them all to work for you your obsessive need to control all things will be satisfied. At least in fantasy.  The many systems each have many details which all must be paid attention to at the same time. This could be a plus or minus depending on the person. The problem is the lack of information given about these details. An internet connection to answer the many questions you will have is recommended. Keeping the automated systems on to start with is also recommended. Try to figure out why the recommendations are being made. The amount of decision making giong on under the hood of this game is immense. If you don't keep up you will not catch the mistakes it makes. Those mistakes are why you can eventually beat the AI and also why you need to learn how to watch your empire. I've lost count of the number of times I've dismantled a ship for doing something stupid and refusing to do what I told it.

            "review_text": "The two main reasons I'm not recommending this game are: Cumbersome interface, and excessive automation.  Whatever great features this game might boast are buried under a needlessly complex user interface, one that appears to plague most modern space 4x games. The game tries to display all the information you need simultaneously on the screen. While many menus are collapsable (much appreciated, btw), unfortunately others are not and prove to be too distracting while I'm trying to figure what systems I own and what my ships are doing on a dizzying map filled with icons of all geometric types.  Every window is crammed to the rim with text that is tiny, uses unpleasant fonts and colors, and provides poor color contrast with backgrounds. I owe my rapidly deteriorating eyesight to the prevalence of this 'text syndrome' in this genre. I was forced to reduce my screen resolution to the minimum, and it still didn't help much. The UI in this game makes me long for MOO3 -- you know, the game no one liked due to its excessive menus.  What makes this UI worse is the constant bombardment of text news and pop-up windows dutifully alerting you to largely inconsequential information, such as Civ X and Civ Y thanking each other for a very minor trade deal, one that had nothing to do with you civ whatsoever. Some more important messages are often duplicated several times, once as scrolling text, another as a pop-up window, and finally a separately loaded screen -- just in case you failed to read it the first two times. The last time I screamed 'I don't care about this crap!' so loudly and frequently was in Gal Civ 2.  To all 4x developers: When designing a UI, please take lessons from Civ 5 or MOO2. You can make a deeply complex game without using a complex interface. Modularize the info into layers and display only the most pertinent info at a time, but allow players to delve deeper, but only when they want to.  The second issue is automation. While I appreciate the great efforts to relieve the 4x player the terrible burdens of micromanagement, there IS such a thing as too much automation, which unduly robs the player the power of decision-making. I spent a good hour trying to figure out how to produce a colony ship, or move a prebuilt one, only to realize that all colonization was automated, with zero input from me. Automation + Real Time = Sit back and twiddle that thumb.  There ARE options to turn off a lot of the automation, but much of it remains. After turning it off completely, I was still getting tons of mission reports from my scouts discovering new ruins, even though I never sent them on any mission. I was getting reports that my fleet won a major victory against pirates, even though I never ordered it to attack anyone. Reports that one of my spies got caught in an allied civ, even though I never ordered the spy mission (or even knew the spy existed). Reports that my troops have begun invading -- well, you get the idea.   I suppose this is what a figurehead feels like. While it can be occasionally relaxing and even enjoyable to sit back and watch a whole game play itself out, I would sure love to be able to make SOME decisions -- I am playing a 4x game, after all, and not watching a movie.   Perhaps if I had more than 2 hours to play this game, I'd have a deeper appreciation, but alas that is the time window Steam gives us for returns,",

Nearly everything is automated and you can literally walk away from the game and come back an hour later to discover you have won the game. Auto-colonize, auto-build, auto-fight, etc. etc. What's the point? There is no strategy here in fact I would say that there is not a game here to begin with, but rather an automated simulation with very poor graphics and no enjoyment-value at all... Not sure where the good reviews are coming from, but I can asure you that this ain't no Master of Orion 1 or 2 and it for sure ain't no gal civ 1, 2, or 3. I would recommend space empires or gal civ 3 over this dated misrepresented trash.",

Before the game even begins you have dozens of different options when it comes to creating your galaxy. You can choose the size, number of planets, rival faction spawns, mob spawns, pirate spawns, your government, rival faction governments, etc. You can begin the game as a large and overexpanding empire, a single planet spieces finally looking towards the stars, or a young space fairing civilization that has a few established colonies, the choice is yours. Actually, you can do far more than that if you get creative. This game has some impressive automation. So much that you can choose to automate EVERYTHING and watch the game create it's own story. Better yet, you can set everything to automate with the exception of a small fleet or say a single ship. Then assume command of that fleet/ship and play the game as if you were Captain Kirk of The Enterprise! It's basically a sandbox. Do what you want, how you want, when you want.   All that being said I can't recommend this game enough! Once you get past the steep learning curve this game becomes extremely rewarding and will give you THOUSANDS of hours of gameplay. And whenever you get bored you can mod the game up with the dozens of AMAZING overhauls that exist thanks to the modding community. If you don't want to overhaul the game then go with something smaller such as graphics/icon customization packs. Seriously, if you love grand strategy games, space, sandbox games, and losing yourself in a massive and unique universe then this game is for you!",

Its a war that can play out using all sorts of different kinds of hostility. Aggressive territory expansion, manipulative economic domination, and exploitation of less fortunate species are all viable tactics here.   I can't talk enough about the scale of the game. The galaxy is immense, and the number of planets is staggering.   The most obvious problem is the interface according to most reviews, but I would challenge them to make one that's better. The interface design COULD be better, but a significant amount of development time would have gone into it. In general, though the player will often have to create their own ways of navigating the UI efficiently, it works well enough. The ability to pause the game makes issuing complex orders easy. Fleet organization isn't great (not helped by the average interface design). Ship retrofitting, especially once hundreds of ships are available to select from, is a huge pain in the ♥♥♥.   Despite the fact that the civilian sector is handled for you, I feel like there's a hidden trove of gameplay potential hidden there that isn't explored. There are no major corporations, civilian coalitions, or any real society elements here. Just keep the taxes reasonable and everyone's fine.   Combat tends to be a bit iffy. This is the only real failing of the game, since steam rolling with giant balanced fleets tends to win the day. Micromanagement of combat is very difficult, and the Ship Response system you can program into different classes doesn't REALLY give the kind of tactical complexity that one might hope for. What it boils down to is fleet positioning. Where do you put your largest fleets? Your smallest? What planets function as military shield worlds, and which ones as economic centers? Macro strategy succeeds where micro strategy fails.  The learning curve is very deep. You'll play a few failed games and go through a long tutorial before you really comprehend the totality of whats going on in-game.",
