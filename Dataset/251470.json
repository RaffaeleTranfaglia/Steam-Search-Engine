    "description": "TowerFall Ascension is the definitive version of the hit archery combat game. Inspired by classics from the golden age of couch multiplayer, it's a 4-player local party game centering around hilarious, intense versus matches. The core mechanics are simple and accessible, but hard to master and combat is fierce.",

            "review_text": " Note: This game can only be played locally. There is no online multiplayer whatsoever.   Spectacular battle arena-type game focused on fast-paced bow and arrow oriented combat, with mechanics that are very approachable and, for the most part, easy to figure out on your own. The relative transparency of its mechanics does not, however, mean that it is an easy game to master, with its tight controls, twitch counterplay mechanics, and well-crafted, deceptive arenas. A notable feature is the added dimension of screen wrapping - players or objects that pass through the bottom of the screen will come out through the top, left side through the right, and vice versa. Should you decide to pick the game up, you will soon discover what a devilish thing this can be.  The game is split into three modes: Versus, Co-op, and Trials. The Versus mode pits 2-4 players against one another in one of three different sub-modes, all focused on killing the opposing players, with a large number of game modifiers available that change the games in a variety of ways. There are a large number of stages available, some of which have to be unlocked through various means. Co-op mode (perhaps more aptly called 'Quest mode', as it can be played and enjoyed perfectly well as a solo experience) is a mode that pits you and a friend (up to three friends in the expansion's version of co-op) against waves of different enemies on each of the themed maps. There's not much more to it than that, but it is enjoyable and provides for some challenge if you're going for achievements. Lastly, Trials is a time trial mode that challenges you to destroy a number of dummies as quickly as possible with the tools available in each stage. It's somewhat maddening, but engrossing for the obsessive.  Overall there is little about the game that I can fault. The most notable flaw is its lack of online multiplayer, the exclusion of which may well have been intentional, as the game appears to have been constructed to strongly encourage getting together and duking it out with a group of friends. Even so, I would recommend it as a singleplayer game due to its inherent charm and the challenges it provides in its Quest and Trial modes, although I imagine a lot of people would disagree with me on this point. I'm just a sucker for a good challenge wrapped into a neat little package. I expect I will be returning to this game many times in the future.",

            "review_text": "The game on it's own right is pretty good. The real flaw in this game comes in the fact that there is no online multiplayer. With that said the Bad out weighs the good simply on that fact. The single player isn't enpugh for the price tag, and not having multiplayer completely makes it not worth it.",

            "review_text": "  TowerFall Ascension  shines brilliantly, to put it bluntly.  I had this on my wishlist for quite some time, but for some reason I couldn't match up what I would see on the trailers with the overwhelmingly positive reviews.  What was it about this title that had people so wrapped up in it?  Let me try to explain:   1. The controls are excellent.  Only a few buttons, yet there is  sooo much difference  between being skilled at it, which requires a fairly complete understanding of the system, and being ‘meh’. It seems simple at the start, where you are clunkily platforming around the levels (at the time you think its just fine), until you start learning how to 'dodge-cancel' and soon enough you will be flying around in a way you would have previously thought impossible.   2. All the action takes place on a single screen.  This allows for purely awesome couch co-op or versus.  TowerFall  revels in how simple it  feels , but yet has many layers of complexity that it rolls back as you dig in.   3. The action is fast and furious.  It doesn’t get any better than this, as far as couch co-op or versus goes.  I even had friends playing this that would never touch a platformer.  I mean it was complex enough for a serious gamer, yet could draw in newbs. Tons of mode customization as well, and lots of cool trophy unlocks (tons actually) and statistics that keep me coming back for more.   Caveat:  the only deal-breaker for this game, is that you must have controllers, and you must have friends willing to come over and sit on the couch to play local. If you don’t have this, go elsewhere. Single player is really fun since I look at it as training, but other than that, I would not recommend just for single player experience.   I could go on and on, but at the end of the day – I am hooked.  I think my friends may be hooked as well. At this point, it’s my favorite game at the moment, and I plan to get many hours out of it (I even set up a competition and invited 8-10 people over in early June 2015).",

I also find it quite fun to play through co-op levels as a solo player.  One word of warning: the game is a bit pricey just by itself, but to really get the most out of it you'll very likely want the expansion. The expansion's features are fully integrated into the core game, but if you try to use them it'll tell you you have to buy the DLC. :-p  Without the expansion, you can only play co-op with 2 players, each of whom has a fixed number of lives. The expansion adds co-op levels for up to 4 players, but there's no lives store - if a player dies, another player has to revive him, and if all players are dead the game's over (continuing is possible). These worlds can also be played solo mode with fixed lives, and unlike the core game worlds you can continue if you die on a particular level.  The versus mode is quite fun, and does a great job of balancing skill levels without dampening the fun (if you're winning, you get fewer arrows, and if you're way behind you start with a shield). The number of interesting outcomes for a battle seems quite high, and I find myself saving replay GIFs regularly. Neat little details abound, such as the way you can knock someone's hood or hat off if your arrow merely brushes through their hair instead of hitting them squarely. Occasionally some odd tweak will appear unexpectedly in a co-op level, and some of these lead to unlockable new characters you can play as.",

Pros:  -good gameplay -cool graphics -kinda cheap (I bought mine on  humblebundle.com  for super cheap) -level editor (If you have the DLC) -great game to play with friends  Cons: -no online multiplayer, although I think this is necessary for this kind of game because it is made for playing with friends on the same couch as you, if you know what I mean.",

The sad thing is that I can't play this online, that is my only concern, and the other is being that I can't play with more people!

With added Mac and Linux support (that I have not tested yet), its over the top awesome. I strongly recommend this to anyone interested.  Two important caveats. First, it is a versus game at its core and offline only. If you aren't ever going to be playing couch co-op with friend or at LAN parties, you lose a lot of the value. Even just one v one is super fun. You can keep it interesting for a long time with all the different varients. Second, controllers are basically necessary. I use the 360 controller, and it works great without having to messing around with any settings. You can use others as far as I know.
