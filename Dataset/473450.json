            "review_text": "It's relatively easy to write a funny joke and put it inside a game. It's harder to use game mechanics to turn the gameplay itself into a funny joke. This game manages to do both. A masterpiece of an old game comedy genre, the 'unfair platformer' (think Kaizo Mario), it murders you in all the funniest and silliest ways, while the narrator, a foul-mouthed psychopath of GLaDOS scale, mocks your every action. Short and spicy, this game manages to turn even the frustration into comedy.",

I would definitaly reccomend this game for someone who wants something different besides shooters. The narrator in the game is as said, a major ♥♥♥♥. He definitaly adds frustration to the game when you die. He mocks and insults and that alone makes you want to countinue playing the game. 10/10 would rage again.",
