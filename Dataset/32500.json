I really enjoyed it and I watched a lot of YouTube videos saying how bad it was and as my own person I went into it and I enjoyed it.  Way before the times of YouTube and YouTube game critics we had to buy games to see if we liked them or not and hell if you don’t it just sits on the shelf never to be played again, but I don’t understand why most only play 0.8 hours etc and then say it’s a bad game when clearly they have not played it all the way.  I would say to anyone don’t trust others views and go with your own as this game is not as bad as it sounds. 10/10",

The gameplay is more fluid and the caracter is way more enjoyable to play. There is also a nice graphic improvement. Being more of a beat'em all, it makes the game fun to play as a whole.  It still have many downsides, first of all being the lenght of the game. If you're an average player, you shouldn't need more than 5-6 hours top to beat the game and that's by taking your time. Second biggest flaw is the story. It's dumb and nonsensical from start to finish. So if you are looking for a fun and dumb game whit a lot of action where you can be a badass with a lightsaber (or two), you will probably enjoy it. If you are a fan of the star wars lore or want a deeper, longer game, this is not the game for you (go play KOTOR or something like that).  And most of all, don't pay it full price.",

I advise playing The Force Unleashed first before jumping into the sequel. They are both great.    Rating 10/10  It's slightly liniar but that will be forgotten fast with the quick action packed levels with plenty of story and carnage along the way.",

It's about actually using the Force in combat to throw a beat down, as apposed to all the stuff we see in the movies, like moving crap and falling really far. How easy to defeat would the droids in the Clone Wars have been if the Jedi were throwing around Force Lightning? Or using Force Grip to crush some droid tanks? How much more exciting would the cartoon and movies have been if the Jedi acted like the Super Heroes they were supposed to be, instead of emotionless droids with glowy sticks that can move and push things?  If you are looking for a RPG with a deep, interesting story, buy KOTOR 1 and 2. If you're looking for a action game where you play as a Jedi, buy Jedi Outcast and Jedi Academy. If you want to kick some serious ♥♥♥ with the Force, and defeat entire armies all by yourself, and show what real warriors who command the Force can do, buy this and Force Unleashed 1.",

However, the gameplay is very repititious and the main campaign is shockingly short. I beat it on medium difficulty in around 5 hours, and the other modes do not add much replayability. This is definitely a one-and-done game.  One thing worth noting is that this game is beautiful. I'm only running an HD4850 at the moment and I was able to max out the settings with antialiasing and a resolution of 1440x900 while maintaining a solid framerate. I found myself taking several moments in-between combat sections just to stop and enjoy the visuals.  If you're looking for some quick action and some eye candy, wait for it to go on sale and pick it up. I don't think it's worth the $20 price tag because it's so incredibly short, but if you get it for less you just might enjoy the ride.",

You play a secret disciple to Darth Vader who has a change of heart, but you quickly learn to realize that this storyline and gameplay didn't continue at all into this game. The gameplay does have a little fun to it, once in a while, but it's very lackluster even at the very start. It's very repetitive and just doesn't get you immersed into this character or make you feel very powerful. It feels very choppy and unenjoyable. There's even an instance where you have to bring down a huge Star Destroyer which makes you feel so damn amazing finally, but quickly puts you back to reality once you start trying because the controls and mechanics in which to do so are so obscure that the only way you can find out how to actually complete that part is to youtube the sequence. The mainstory is ridiculously short, I played about 5 hours and finished the entire campaign on Medium, and was easily forgettable.  Pros: - It's a Star Wars game?  Cons: - Gameplay is lackluster - Storyline is lackluster - Campaign is less than 5 hours long - There's an instance in the game where you must google in order to continue  ********* TL;DR ********* Personally, I only recommend picking up this game if/when it's on sale (I was fortunate enough to pick it up for $3 during the Summer sale).

The game is ridiculously short, it took me a total of 4 hours to beat the campaign, and I was not speeding through it (I find it funny that my playtime includes watching the entirety of the credits). The amount of bugs in this game is also insane, even in game cinematics have very obvious bugs. Stormtroopers heads shaking around, Darth Vader walking through the ground, etc. When you see a pre-rendered cinematic having ridiculous bugs, just turn off your pc. There is no vertical sync option and the screen is always tearing so much so that its strange when there isn't a tear. Story is pointless and tacked on, nothing that happens is important, honestly can't even think of anything to say about it, but you will get a few laughs out how awkward it can be. The gameplay isn't even as good or tight as the first (which wasn't good or tight at all), the lightsaber pausing everytime you hit an enemy for a second drove me insane.  The only positive thing I can say about this game is that if you are a Star Wars fanatic like myself you will get a bit of enjoyment out of this. The music of John Williams is never disappointing, and a lightsaber always is fun.  This game is nowhere near $20 value as there is story based DLC for other games that are of more quality and longer than The Force Unleashed II. I honestly feel bad for anyone that paid $60 for it. It's pretty clear that the developer signed a contract saying they needed to make a sequel and had no idea what to do. There are plenty of fantastic Star Wars games that you should spend your time with such as the Jedi Knight or Knights Of The Old Republic series. Even if you have already played those games you will enjoy playing them again for four hours more than you will enjoy beating The Force Unleashed II's campaign.  Still not convinced?

All in all, this is a mixed bag of bits. If you have played the previous episode, disappointment will set in rather quickly. Graphically, character animations are much improved from the original, but backgrounds seem to be standard fodder and there is a marked difference in quality of some levels. Sound and effects are satisfying, and the game doesnt suffer the random volume levels of the previous one where background n arration and music would drop out for no reason. Satisfying sound a-la Lucasfilm and Star Wars themes a plenty here.    Gameplay wise however the game falls flat on its face. The game suffers from tedious poor story and level development, making you duplicate the levels backwards in places to act as filler. Camera focus is annoying and often leads you to wish you could pull the camera back just to see what you are doing. in other places, the system, works fine, so its not a complete waste, but it could have been better. All in all, the level design is a bit dull. This wouldnt be too bad if the general tone of the missions was different but monotonous repetitive grinding gets boring after a while.   Although theres are some nice touches (breakable environments, the occasional heroic cutscene as you destroy a big boss (a-la Gods Of War), and your force powers have a decent effect on the enemies and environments, the bad sides of the gameplay spoil what could have been a great game into a mediocre 3rd person lightsaber grind.   Story wise, this is pretty lame. without giving too much away, theres one part that was completely un-necessary and was just there to get you from place a to place b. theres no fluid action in this game. its stop/start 'kill enemies/watch cutscene of new enemies appearing/repeat'. crowbaring other canon characters into the game was stupid as well. its smacks of desparation as the devs just didnt have any ideas and ended up snatching defeat from teh jaws of victory. Frankly, if the devs havent learned how to write a decent game yet and are relying on the star wars name and licence to sell it, its no wonder it is held in such revile by fans of the Star Wars universe.  Recommended for fans of Star wars and people who are that bored that they need a short game to pass a few hours with some utterly ridiculous plot points, but this is lame in comparison to the original and youll porobably never play it again  ",

The story felt like it was trying to be one overarching story split up over two games (with, I assume, the second part being delivered via the third game in the series,) kind of like how Empire and ROTJ did it. However, it ended up being more like if A New Hope ended right as the Millennium Falcon is being pulled onto the Death Star. When it ends, it gives you the choice between a light- and dark-side ending; I chose the dark side ending, and it legitimately made me think they ended the game prematurely on purpose to make players choose the light side, (much like how in Arkham City, when you play as Catwoman near the end, you are able to choose to say '♥♥♥♥ batman' and just leave with the jewels, whereupon you are awarded a lame ending and are then sent back to make the cannon-appropriate decision.) Needless to say, I was pretty surprised when after the credits, the game threw me back to the title screen with no option to pick up where I left off.  Moreover, there are really only 3-4 actual levels in the game, all of which, while somewhat distinct from each other, seem to be comprised solely of a few rooms and enemy configurations repeated over and over again until you get to the boss. All of the boss battles are your standard-affair 'exploit weakness until boss falls down, then run in for the kill' type, except they are all artificially lengthened to the point that they get kinda boring.  The combat outside of boss battles is pretty fun, but there isn’t a whole lot of variety in experience or enemy type. You are able to upgrade your powers with exp, but none of the upgrades really made me feel like they had any impact in my overall combat ability. Same goes for the saber crystals.  TLDR: The game wasn’t bad necessarily, but it felt more like a drawn-out expansion of the first game rather than its own distinct entry in the series. The story was dull and didn’t even seem finished, and the gameplay is extremely repetitive. I would recommend passing on this one unless you absolutely loved the first TFU.",

Compared to the original Force Unleashed, it's more fun to play, slicker, and has far fewer moments that pretend to be challenging but are actually just annoying (no Purge Troopers here!). But it's also more forgettable, shorter (and yet still repetitive), less rewarding to replay, and the story somehow manages to be tedious despite the short length of the game.  I wouldn't recommend this even if you liked The Force Unleashed. I did, for all its flaws. This sequel does get rid of some of those flaws, but what remains is a scant few hours of disposable and unnecessary cruft. If you need to buy every Star Wars game that exists, then maybe consider this a low priority.
