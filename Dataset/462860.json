            "review_text": "  A fairly classic dungeon crawler type of game with nice multiplayer capabilities and programmatic loot generation (à la Diablo). There are some RPG elements, both with character experience and the single player storyline, while multiplayer follows a more modern loot-and-shoot action game. The graphics are mostly 8-bit with some nice 3d isometric touches. There are a variety of biomes in the dungeons, and the difficulty scaling allows a challenge for even ridiculously over-speced teams. Programmatic regeneration of dungeon layouts allow for variety in subsequent playthroughs or in dungeon mode.  Plus, you can throw poop. What’s not to like?",

            "review_text": "  I got this game as a free copy to beta test.   Its the kind of game that you'll sit down play for a bit and then get hooked... The fast paced battles aganst hordes of orcs and ghosts and even more! Just add to that addictive hook that this game is. now im not just saying this because I got a free copy I really enjoy this game and I hope others do too, Now take what ive typed and realise this game is only being worked on by 2 people. It's truely an amazing project and I hope they go far with this game.  Gameplay is fast and fun, and as ive played though the beta ive seen the game get more polished. I understand that this game might not be your cup of tea, But thats not the case for me and others as ive played with them in the beta.  9.8/10 much Goat jokes.",

            "review_text": "  Crawlers and Brawlers is a charming game with an apparently large amount of content. While I wouldn't recommend it for it's depth, it is an apparently decent time waster and could potentially be very fun with friends. I have only been able to play it singleplayer, so far. Overall, this is not a bad title, and is definitely a good pick up as long as you have some friends to play with. I'm now going to talk about some aspects of the game and give my opinion on each.    Graphics   The game has a very nice and simple aesthetic, reminiscent of  Realm of the Mad God. . If you like good retro graphics, this game has them. The one thing I could complain about is how there's not enough variety in the color palette and it's very hard to see things on the screen at times, because of how they mesh together. There were points where I couldn't see a  BOSS  because I mistook him for a wall, and a situation where I thought a goblin died because he was the same color as goblin blood.    Music   Two words to explain how the music gets is... well, ear grating. None of the tracks are by no means bad, but they're incredibly repetitive with no variety. You'll hear the same track on repeat throughout an entire 5 floor dungeon, and it'll drive you mad.    Controls   The game loses points for me based on the lack of control options. BUT... I must confess that the keyboard controls are very responsive and nice. The game feels well to control, and it works in my opinion. There's not much else to say about it.    Gameplay   Honestly, if you're playing a warrior (which I've only been able to try so far), all you do is left click and occasionally use skills. It's very cut-and-dry and unintuitive combat. It works for what the game is, but it feels bland. Even having a variety of animations could help break the monotony.  One of the biggest problems I've had is that it seems to be balanced for multiplayer and singleplayer is brutal. There's no real balancing here, and that kinda sucks.   To conclude this review, the biggest flaw I need to bring up is in a lot of areas, the game just isn't varied. For a procedurally generated game, it just feels bland and too repetitive. Even the 'epic loot' promised in the game description is usually just basic things that you start the game with. Why even give you those things when you begin with them? Honestly, this is my biggest complaint with the game. If you want to see some gameplay and first impressions on the game, I created a video on my YouTube channel, here:         YouTube™ Video:  DUNGEON DIVING | Crawlers and Brawlers Gameplay&nbsp;",
