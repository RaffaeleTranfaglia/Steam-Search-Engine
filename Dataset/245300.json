            "review_text": "This game was at one time cancelled for the pc. Why? It did'nt do well on the other platforms I guess. Or maybe not on the right platforms. The game sais Disney all over it. From intro to the singing and to naration. The game is, how should I put it, Magical. Animation is fluid,and very cartoony which is it's intension. This is the type of game I've desired to play for a long time. Trine and Trine 2 also filled that need. Only gripe, it stuck at 30 fps. But to tell ya the truth, it's still smooth. If you like platform gaming, you can't go wrong.",

As a Disney fan I enjoy this game a lot and I have even passed it twice on the 360 :p Aside from graphics and how the controls are, if you enjoy action, adventure and somewhat of a puzzle game I suggest this game. May not look like Disneyland but I mean if you get all the references, better understanding (x  BAD THING ABOUT THIS. It is frustrating playing with Oswald. As you get further into the game you need to work more as a team and there will be parts when he just doesn't do anything at all. You'd get lucky if everything goes smoothly :p If only they had actual online co-op.  10/10 Would play it again... for a 4th time after this. heh",

Now, I know it has crashed for people in other reviews and so on, but it hasn't crashed for me yet, it might be because you don't have the right computer or something, but hey, I'm not trying to point somebody out for their mistakes. Another good reason I like this game is because it references old Disney cartoons, which kind of makes them famous a bit again. To the creators of this game: Thank you for putting this beautiful game on Steam.",

            "review_text": "Sadly I can't recommend this game to anyone. I haven't had the chance to play the first game, but I heard good things about it and I was really hoping that Epic Mickey 2 will be a great 3D platformer, but it's far from it, especially on PC.  The first thing I noticed that the game feels clunky. It often feels like a game from the era when developers were still just experimenting with the idea of 3D in a platformer and often times those games just doesn't feel right. It's something like that here, quite often I couldn't tell wheter an item is behind me or in front of me and if so how far. It's hard to explain, but the 3D just doesn't feel right compared to other games. There are 2D levels as well, but those are mostly really short (and I DO mean really short, 1-3 minutes mostly...).  That's the least of my worries though with this game, there are much bigger ones as well sadly. The PC port is just bad. Both optimization/graphics and control-wise. Especially the latter, the controls are terrible with keyboard+mouse. I pretty much always prefer to play my games with kb+m, but I'd really recommend using a gamepad if you really want to play this game (which you shouldn't).  ...and lastly what really killed the game for me that it's basically a coop game that you can play alone as well and it just doesn't work well in solo. The AI is the worst I've seen since the late '90s. Oswald never does what you want him to do, never around when you need him and pretty much just runs around aimlessly while you wait for him so you can proceed with the game. I wouldn't even bother playing this alone to be honest, the AI pretty much killed all the fun.  All in all Epic Mickey 2 is the shoddy port of a mediocre game with terrible AI. It might be fun if you can get someone to play this with you (using controllers), otherwise skip this one, there are better platformers out there.",

            "review_text": "Not that bad of a game. It certainly looks better than it's predecessor. Heck it even has voice acting now which is neat. I really didn't expect the paint reticule to work as well as it did since it was meant or mouse or wii-mote but it worked great with an xbox controller. Some of my favorite scenes happened when the mad doctor showed up and turned whatever scene he was in into a musical because he refused to speak in anything other than song.  There is a whole lot of content in this game. So much so that I kept feeling like I was missing stuff as I progressed through each level, such as different paths I could have taken to see where they lead or quests I just couldn't complete because I may have screwed something up in another part of the area.  For the most part I tried to stick with the hero path but I inadertantly caused more damage in a lot of areas than I meant to because I thought I was doing the right thing or defending myself.  Anyhoo it was an enjoyable experience and perhaps I'll give it another go eventually to find all the secrets that I might have passed by.",
