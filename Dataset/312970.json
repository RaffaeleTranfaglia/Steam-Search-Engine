However so far of what I've played, I've enjoyed the story, and I am loving the little jokes (some sexual, some normal) that are within the game, and I love the inneundo lift :D  Haven't played enough yet to comment on if the price is justfied, etc. But I like what ive seen so far :)  ***Updated***  On further playing, clicking too many times on things (when getting impatient) can cause the game to crash, and you lose all your progress (because of no autosave ¬_¬)  There isnt a massive amount of bugs, but the one or two I have found, are so terribly game breaking, that I cannot recommend this game, if it was under £5 then maybe I could, but the current cost is too high for what it is.",

            "review_text": "I recommend it because I enjoyed it. It's a cute game with a likeable protagonist, and the story is pretty interesting(also you might not enjoy it if you lack a sense of humour). I didn't like the ending though but not spoling it :P The art is MSPaint but it's drawn quite well for MSpaint, some people don't like it but I really don't mind the art. Better than pixelated artstyle*hides*. Yes, there's no voiceovers but all the chat bubbles are pretty short and to the point so you don't really need it imho, instead the game has some nice music :) And I think $15 is pretty fair for this game, I had the misfortune to buy less enjoyable games for more. Got a few hours of entertainment out of it which is pretty good. The game froze 2 times though so I had to close and re-start it again so make sure you save often!",

            "review_text": "This frivolous point-and-click adventure successfully utilizes the rule which states that everybody loves gay jokes. It's also almost completely innocent and harmless as in fact it contains no obscene content besides some merry puns and ambiguous hints. The absence of the voice acting is a flaw, but not the serious one.  So yeah, this lighthearted comedy is definitely worth checking out.",

Would have been even better if 3D and maybe voice recordings - Music was great btw as well.  I hope the produce a sequel somewhen soon - havent laughed that much while playing a game for a long time.  Keep up the nice work!!!",

Very kitschy, but also does a decent job of capturing the 90s point-and-click adventure game style; a lot of the humor feels in the same vein, but with a gay twist.   It's got some issues; make sure to save often, because sometimes the game will crash. You can double-click when moving to a new screen to skip the often long walking animations.   On the whole, this game was worth playing, and I'm looking forward to playing the sequel.",
