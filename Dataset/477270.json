            "review_text": "Kudos for being the first lightsaber-esque VR game out, and for being relatively cheap. If this game were made for non-VR it'd probably be sold for 50 cents or less - I consider the additional $3.50 to be a VR-dev tip (which they greatly need, given that the number of VR owners is so insanely low compared to the rest of the market).  Anyway, with that in mind, I'm going to review this game as if it were 50 cents.  Pros:   The blades have a great Star Wars feel to them  The game is a fun thing to entertain a guest or yourself for a few minutes of down time  Cons:  Not enough content to make you play this game longer than 20 minutes or so.   Beatable in less than 10 minutes  Blade glow is far too bright  Way too easy (if the dev shrinks the hitboxes on the blades and increases the speed and frequency of lasers, this could be fixed)  Overall:  This game is short and easy, but also fun and relaxing. It's worth 50 cents, plus $3.50 VR tip. My main hope is that the developer makes it harder, which would keep me coming back for more.  Note: I beat the whole thing in less than 10 minutes. You probably will too. There isn't much content and it's extremely easy. I recommend playing only on legendary mode and leaving one of your sabers off. That makes it a bit harder, but it's still so easy I doubt many people will have trouble getting 100% deflections.",

I would also suggest reducing the glare of shots that hit your lightblade, makes the second shot impossible to see.  Maybe add multiple balls?  If you make this game challenging like Pirate Space Trainer and i would definately recommend.",

There's no depth whatsoever. There's almost nothing to do. It's more or less a tech demo. Is it a good tech demo? Yeah. But it's not a game. At the time of writing there's not really anything else scratching that VR Lightsaber itch, so if your really just want something else to help you demo VR to people or just REALLY need to swing your own lightsaber for a bit, it's not a terrible buy.",

Level 5 seems to be level one through 4 (this might change), that's when I considered it to be a waste of time so I quit. I will say again that it has potential so I will revisit the game after a few updates but for now I have to give it a thumbs down.",

Just holding your  nonstarwarsbrand  Lightblade's out in front of you can sometimes be an easy way of deflecting, but I've been surprised more than once by a laser sneaking past my defenses. But it's so much more satisfying to actually deflect the lasers by swinging.",

            "review_text": "Fun Game at first, then this gets very repetitive. It took about 40 mins to finish the game and all its modes. This game is great for those who like Star Wars and always wanted a lightsaber. But this game can use alittle more mojo. The rookie level is something to laugh at and the legendary can be done with one saber if you pay attention. Shots come at you slow and most shots can be deflected by holding your saber in front of you. There is also a mode where you have to survive 250 shots which at first was, I thought, to be hard but with the above comments this was rather easy.  Ways I would improve this game would be to: 1) add troopers/droids that come in waves. You teamed with a squad that you can control with commands from the touchpad (selecting targets, giving individual soldiers an area to cover, using the grips on controllers as force push/pull etc.)  2) make the lasers travel faster. Right now its like playing catch with a 5 year old. And add another bot for an even harder mode. 3) this one is being picky but the saber needs to be faster when deployed. Seems slower that what is seen in movies.  Overall I still would recommend it. Its fun and can burn about an hour of time if needed. I dont think i\\'ll be playing this now that i\\'ve completed it all.",

Some things around to slash? or \\'fruit Ninja\\' mode. The trainer ball up close and moving around you would be nice. I lost interest before completing novice.  supports VIVE so I have to recommend it at 3.99 But at 50% off would be better pricd.",

Wouldn't recommend buying this unless it's on sale for $0.99, and even that might be too much.  Long Review: Honestly, I thought I'd love this game. I'm a huge Star Wars fan. I've seen all the movies, watched the TV shows, and played most of the video games. So when I got an HTC Vive I was one of the many people who wanted a Star Wars game in VR. Sadly I can't even call this a game. The entire game is literally you, a lightsaber as your controller, and a training remote. That's it. While it was cool to pretend your holding a lightsaber and deflecting blaster bolts, the feeling quickly goes away as you realize there isn't anything else to do. There's no stoormtroopers, force powers, or anything really. I realize that this can't literally be a Star Wars game thanks to Disney and EA, but there needs to be a lot more in this 'game' for it to be worth $4. I can't recommend this, even to star wars fans, because there's just nothing to do. This is possably the shortest time I've spent in a VR game. Really dissapointed. Don't fall for the hype. Wait till it's on sale for $0.99 or less, then you too can play it for 10 minutes and never play it again!",

I\\'ll be playing this a ton more when my new video card comes in.  Edit: This game gets a lot more fun when you try to dodge and reflect at the same time. Don't be a couch potato. I get a kick out of quickly swinging for a reflect instead of just holding the blade in front of me.  Games like this are why I play games, and why I have faith in the future of VR.

For future updates, would love to see the following: - Harder &amp; faster difficulty modes - Ability to replay survival &amp; other game types as an arcade mode - Double-bladed sabers - Kylo Ren-style 'exhaust' blades &amp; hilts - Multiple robots! This is the big one. With only one robot, this is a waiting &amp; listening game more than anything else. Multiple enemies would make blocking lasers much more intense because you'd have to react quickly to something that you're not already facing.",
