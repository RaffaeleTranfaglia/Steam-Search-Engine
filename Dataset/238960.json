            "review_text": "I've been playing Path of Exile since 2011 closed beta and it's remarkable how far the game has come purely from crowd funding. The passion of the userbase is equally matched by it's developers. They've shown throughout the years to constantly improve and tweak the game with regularly scheduled content additions. I still feel I don't know everything there is to know about this game, and that isn't changing any time soon. Path of Exile is an incredibly complex and rewarding game that is definitely worth your time.  Outside of having an absurdly intricate skill tree and a fantastic crafting/currency system, the other large appeal of this game is the end-game. Most ARPGs fail to offer incentive to continue to play your character after you've exhausted the content. Usually this just comes in the form of a easily attainable level cap or grinding the same final zone of the game at length. Instead, in POE you are given item drop instances, as described by the developers:   'Maps can drop as normal, magic, rare or unique with higher rarity Maps yielding more items. Using a Map item opens six portals to the area, which can each only be used once. Like most other items in Path of Exile, Maps have mods that change their risks and rewards. Map mods can affect the size or complexity of the level, monster packs, monster properties or even alter characters while in the level. Players can modify Maps themselves using their currency items. For example, you can use an Orb of Transmutation to turn a normal Map into a magic Map, or use an Orb of Alteration to reroll its mods.'  It goes to say that each and every map is a different experience, with room for countless variation in modifiers letting you push the limits of your character. Not all characters are equal. You will find that some characters that excell in early progression have difficulty in the end-game and visa versa. Each character I've made has informed the next which is critical in a game that rewards experience and skill.  And if that wasn't enough, POE offers alternative ARPG experiences in the form of daily race events which are time based leveling with unique modifiers that you won't see in the real game like 'Turbo Mode'. Moreover some of these races have entirely unique content like Descent: Champions or Endless Ledge which offer players the ability to win special art reskins of legendary items for the leagues of their choice.  All in all POE is a truly exciting game and a breath of fresh air for the genre.",

            "review_text": "The best isometric aRPG I've ever played... and it's free. That should be enough to get you to try the game; a character-limit in-depth review follows:  OVERVIEW  A top-down isometric action RPG. This genre has for many years been called 'Diablo clones', and no doubt the game feels like Diablo -- questing, levelling up, finding gear, and using skills to kill stuff -- but the systems behind the gameplay are really well thought out, and especially the skill system is much deeper than any other aRPG.  Path of Exile is completely, utterly free. And don't let this dissuade you from trying it, because I think it's the best isometric aRPG I've ever played. Microtransaction cash offers no competitive advantage in the game, just cosmetic enhancements, extra stash tabs, and character slots. So if the game sounds interesting, just try it for yourself! But meanwhile, here's why you should:  STORY  Okay, let's be honest: This probably isn't a game you're playing for the story. Without the huge budget of a Blizzard Entertainment, you're not going to get 3-minute epic cutscenes that draw you in with movie quality. Grinding Gear Games seems to have focused on making the game good instead, and I support that decision. That being said, the underlying narrative isn't bad per se, just fairly standard and doesn't really distinguish itself.  GRAPHICS  The graphics are perfectly good for my purposes. They look decent, even if they didn't blow me away in the fully zoomed out mode. They actually look pretty good zoomed in, but of course when enemies can attack you from offscreen even fully zoomed out, nobody is going to play zoomed in. Regardless, the graphics made the game much more gritty. While Diablo went cartoonish, and Torchlight was brightly colored and animated, the world of Wraeclast is dark and dangerous, and everything in the game re-enforces that harshness. Levels are nicely differentiated: cavernous dungeons, a waste of sunken ships, temples of polished marble, rocky cliffs, forests, etc. Some of the dungeons are really downright creepy. As are some enemies. Heck, even your hero -- You are a criminal, an exile, and as such are portrayed with a harsh ugliness that works pretty well. Other minor things show attention to detail, like arrows sticking out of enemies or walls after you fire them. While the graphics may not impress on a technological level, the art direction here is well done.  (I'm also led to believe that various spell effects become a lot more impressive-looking if you buy a microtransaction.)  SOUND  I didn't really notice the sound. And I think that's not a bad thing; while it would be nice to have music tracks that really blew me away, other than that I tend to think good sound in a game is like good service at a restaurant -- mostly invisible, because it delivers what you need without belaboring the point. Creepy areas felt creepy, spiders skittered, armor clanked, spell effects were satisfying, and perhaps most importantly, commentary from my character was just frequent enough to be interesting. I easily tire of games where my character blathers on every third minute with the same tired catchphrases. Likewise, there was never any lull in music where the game felt too silent, nor irritating track repeated so often that an annoying melody got stuck in my head. So I'll again say the sound is perfectly fine; unlikely to impress, but no negative marks here either.  GAMEPLAY MECHANICS  Ah, finally the thing that matters most, and the reason you should be downloading this game right now. The fighting itself is fairly standard aRPG; click on things and push letters to use various skills to attack the enemies. There's more strategy than that, because you can drop traps and totems and have forking and radius skills etc. etc. But the systems behind all of this game are what put Path of Exile far ahead of the pack. So let's talk about them. There are a lot of small things that show some thought behind the game, from the various loot settings, to the ease of dropping into pick-up groups, to the simple way instances are handled, to the large 4-tabbed stash shared between all of your characters. But the main gameplay innovations, the reasons Path of Exile is the game I've been playing non-stop for weeks on end, can be divided into two main categories: Skills, and Economy.  SKILLS  Skills in Path of Exile are complex. The briefest way to describe it is that their active skills were inspired by Final Fantasy VII, and their passive skills by Final Fantasy X. But that would be far from giving you the whole story.  So, the first thing to explain is that any character can gain any skill. Your class determines starting stats and starting location in the 'Skill Forest'. Every active skill exists in the form of a gem that is red (str), green (dex), or blue (int). Gear has sockets of those colors to hold gems. When a gem is placed into your gear, you now have that skill. Skill gems can be removed at any time, so no worries about experimenting. Some gear has linked sockets, allowing you to equip support gems that augment other linked gem skills. Equipped gems gain experience over time, and you can choose to level them up, raising their power, but also raising the stat requirements. So any character can use any skill, but it will be tougher for a Marauder to use a level 15 Firestorm than it will for a Witch.   Each time you level up, you will receive one passive skill point to spend in the Skill Forest. The Skill Forest contains something like 1,350 nodes. No, that's not a typo. There are 1,350 places to spend skill points. So even if you maxed out your character after a year of playing to the highest level, you'd have covered less than 1/10 of the grid.  There are basic +10 to a stat nodes, and your character will start near many of their favored stat, although you can follow a path anywhere you like. There are nodes to improve spellcasting, movement, accuracy, damage, and so on. At various places on the grid, there are clusters of nodes that grant bonuses to each weapon type or elemental damage type. Some nodes add life, evasion, or energy shield. Some nodes add resists, block rates, or criticals. Bigger nodes are fewer and farther between, but each one gives a benefit generally more than twice as good as a standard small node.   And then there are keystone nodes. These giant circular nodes around the edges of the grid tend to be huge trade-offs that completely change your character. Eldritch Battery removes your character's energy shield, converting it entirely to extra mana. Chaos Innoculation reduces your life to 1, but makes you immune to chaos(poison) damage. Either one will change your character drastically; taking both will kill you. Other skills remove your armor, your evasion, or even your ability to deal damage with active skills, offering various trade-offs in return.  Anyway, the skill system is incredibly complex, and while there are thankfully respec points you can gain by questing in game (and more from certain loot), it's worth pre-planning skills.  ECONOMY  Path of Exile has no gold.  Because there is no accumulating pile of money, there is no money sink of repairs or potions. (Flasks are equipment items that refill automatically as you kill enemies, and can be enchanted.) Vendoring items nets you various orbs, and vendor items have orb purchase prices. But the key difference is that everything has inherent value. Orbs do not just accumulate uselessly like gold in many of these games, because every orb has inherent value. They improve your items in different ways, allowing you to enchant your new hybrid flask, reroll the enchantment on your boots, and reroll the number of sockets on your armor.   Crafting is complex.  CONCLUSION  Skill Forest is complex too. Path of Exile is aiming for hardcore gamers when other games are streamlining more casual. This is a game by gamers, for gamers, and it shows.",

            "review_text": "I could recommend this game for a good many reason, most of which I notice have already been mentioned by other reviewers. The best thing, for me, about this game is it's truly open-ended character building. You aren't squished into a rigid, constricted class. Granted, certain classes have certain bonuses to certain stats(ie, Maurader class starts with high strength stats), but beyond that you are perfectly free to build your character into whatever you want them to be. Skills are gained, not through grinding, leveling up and unlocking them, but by finding skill gems throughout the world. The gems fit into color-coded slots on your armor and weapons.  Some pros and cons:  Pros: -Free to Play but not Pay to Win -Easy enough to get into if you have the time. No real background in RPGs needed to enjoy this game. -Plenty, and I mean PLENTY to do. You will not be bored. -Maps are randomly generated labrynths. No dungeon will ever be the same twice. -(this could be a con depending on your tastes) hoards of monsters that inhabit each dungeon. Getting strong enough to mow them down like blades of grass is oh, so satisfying. -A unique barter system that cuts out gold or other currencies from the game. New players don't start out poor and feel they have to grind just to buy good gear. -Diablo style loot system. You're going to find the best stuff out there in the game world, not in an NPC's shop. -(Mostly personal preference here:) No constantly buying potions. Flasks that fill with health potion or mana potion are found as drops ingame and are refilled each time you slay an enemy.  Cons: -If you like it, it will take over your life. -Definitely not casual. When you sit down to play, plan on spending at least two hours on one play session. -Quests become somewhat repetative. 'Go here, find this. Come back with something to prove it.' Sort of thing. Each dungeon being unique helps cut out any sense of monotony, though. -Waypoints are few and far between. At maximum, there is one per map. Some maps have multiple levels to them, and the waypoint exists only on one specific level. Some maps lack a waypoint entirely. -Won't run on a toaster. I tried downloading this game on my old windows 7 toaster, and the game never even made it past the loading screen.  Overall, especially considering the price tag, I am calling this my favorite rpg ever. The graphics are beautiful.The voice acting blew me away considering this is F2P. It's dark and mysterious. Even now that I feel I'm getting the hang of it, I still feel a sense of forboding whenever I enter a new portion of a dungeon. Some people might call this a Diablo cheap knock-off. Cheap? Well, only if you mean the price tag. It's a very well-thought-out and well-made game. Diablo knock-off? Maybe. It does borrow heavily from the Diablo franchise. I can't personally say how much as I don't play Diablo; but I notice the similarities whenever I watch a youtube video involving the Diablo games and for a moment think 'Hey, is that Path of Exile?'",

            "review_text": "POE is basically an ARPG based loosely off the Diablo system. From what I have read about POE many old Diablo programmers are involved with POE and its gameplay mechanics. There are many saying that this is what Diablo 3 should be. I am not hear for that and would rather not compare the two, as I am one of the few who really enjoy Diablo 3. POE sports some interesting mechanics in gameplay as there is no gold or currency value in game or auction house of any sorts. Gems play a big part in leveling your gear and increasing stats. Inventory loadouts tend to fill quickly as you can not carry much. The locations and minions of POE universe are interesting and varied. POE has a rather dark tone to it with violent acts and blood.   I do have a gripe with sync/lag as it has been an issue for a while and that nano second where you dont get a hit or take damage in a ARPG is critical and this can be become frustrating. I do want to note that if you have not played this game yet and get started into it - the game starts very slowly and with very weak environments that are bland and a turn off. Many people have quit thinking this is what the game will be and it does indeed get more varied and graphically interesting... just need to play through a couple of realms first.  For a FTP game this is just an amazing game where I would be willing to pay actual money for it, so I will consider donating with some visual items you can buy directly through Steam in the POE micro transaction shops. These micro transactions are not pay to win and are cosmetic enhancements for the most part. In case you missed it - Gamespot announced POE as the PC Game of the Year. Recommended.",

Pick a character class and start pointing and clicking until you kill enough things to level up, gain more skills, and get better gear to kill more things! You build your character around the skills you choose to use, represented as gems that are slotted into your gear. As you level up, you put points into the massive (and I mean MASSIVE) passive skill tree to customize your character to how you want to play. The game runs through about level 36, Cruel difficulty to level 54, and Merciless to 68. The endgame (starting at level 66) consists of 'maps' that can drop from killing monsters.   Pros : Simple to learn, difficult to master. The enemies are diverse and always challenging, the maps are randomized, the skills are interesting and fun, and the loot system is incredibly well done. Joining friends is easy and fun. Did I mention the game is FREE?   Cons : The passive skill tree can be incredibly daunting to new players. There is no ability to respec your skills aside from starting over, so don't plan on your first character reaching the maps.   Conclusion : Play this game! It's simple to pick up and play at your own pace and consistently rewarding you for learning its more complex mechanics. Plus its free, the developer  ONLY  sells cosmetic items, so there is no possible way to gain a gameplay advantage by paying money unlike many other 'Free' to Play games out there (see: Neverwinter).",

Path of Exile has an amazing atmosphere, really diverse enemies and maps, incredible amounts of depth and complex, the biggest talent tree I've seen in any game by far, and thousands of hours of content - all for free! Absolutely no real money required - only cosmetic items, more stash space (which there's enough already, mind you), and more character slots (default 24 - more than enough) can be bought using real money. And the game is so complicated that even after 100h+ of game time I'm still learning tons of new stuff all the time, and I believe I keep learning for the next 500 hours at least!  The devs are also god-tier (and by that I don't mean nonexistent, but ♥♥♥♥ing awesome), which is nowadays more important than ever.

When I originally found PoE in closed beta, I was immediately taken by the team at Grinding Gear Games dedication to their project. I could feel the passion seething from them as I watched videos featuring the Devs expressing their plans for the game and what they aimed to accomplish.   As a seasoned PC Gamer who has spent thousands of hours enjoying the Diablo Franchise, as brought to us by Condor, AKA Blizzard North; I was immensely excited for the launch of Diablo 3. In fact, myself, my girlfriend, and two of my friends actually sat outside Futureshop smoking herb and drinking gin (seriously) from about 9PM until the Midnight Launch.   We all bought our Collector's Editions (well, I actually bought a box of 6.. knowing how good the extras were and how limited the CE was)... anyways.. we return to our homes excited to begin our journey in the new Diablo... only to find that BlizzTURD and CRAPtivision had fu*ked the doge... and NONE of us could install due to server issues!   We literally had to break out Diablo 2 | LoD to get our fix that night! That was the start to a very very bad launch of Diablo 3... a game that 'lead director' Jay Wilson completely destroyed.   I personally witnessed many people politely and eloquently express their concerns with the game direction (WoWified... shi7 loot systems.. repetative and linear gameplay.. the list goes on..) get PERMANENTLY banned by the forum admins, actually removing their access to the game they had purcahsed, seriously.. should be CRIMINAL what the blizz dev's were doing.. and I specifically remember one of the BlizzTURDs 'Bashiok' who was relentlessly banning people.   The inhuman garbage at Blizz responsible for the turd known as D3 have permanently tarnished both BlizzTURD and CRAPtivision for me personally.. and I'm glad they did... because it helped convince me to invest over 600 USD in supporter packs for PoE... I don't regret one cent.. I only wish I had invested more to had my own unique added to the game!  Path of Exile is a magnificently complex game with beautiful artwork and an exceptional story line.   Amazing what GGG have managed to accomplish, supporting the entire development with ethical microtransactions (cosmetic only, not pay2win)  Solid 10/10 game. Magnificent.",

Okay, so there's no gold, and you don't really get what that means? Neither did I... for two days, THEN you'll be Master of Coin, I promise. Two days, on the dot. Less if you drink energy drinks.   Yes Path of Exile is extremely complex. One of the most complex games you can find... but that doesn't mean you need to learn every little detail to become good, and it doesn't mean it's going to take a year for that to happen. Just jump in. It takes effort, sure. But the effort is fun and enjoyable, and you meet new friends along the way who are eager to help.   You're a hardcore gamer, amigo. You just don't know it yet. So come join us!  If you do, you will be greatly rewarded.  Welcome to the rabbit hole, friend. Now, down down down you fall, like many have before. And what lies ahead of you, I simply cannot summarize in review. But I cannot wait for you to experience like I did. Enjoy.  Lostman-  Edit: And I'm sure this is already known by readers, but this game is legitly free. There are no Pay2Win aspects. Though I have donated quite a bit to the cause and you may not be in a place to show that kind of support at the moment, I will have no advantage over you in the game other than my hair will be a tad shinier (who cares?).",

Love the pay model of buying only appearance changes. Absolutely no way to make it pay to win or even pay for convenience. I have given them more money than I care to admit.  It's amusing to note people say this is what Diablo 3 should've been. Blizzard seems to have noticed as many of the features that have been rolled in (seasons, rifts, etc) all appear to be directly mirrored off how PoE implemented the same concepts.",

            "review_text": "Many, many others have already said it, but at risk of sounding like a mindless parrot drone - this game is MUCH closer to what most Diablo fans wanted D3 to be (including myself). I won't necessarily say this game is what Diablo 3 should have been, but it's certainly not difficult for me to imagine that most people would have been much happier if it had turned out exactly like PoE has. As it states in the last bullet point in the 'Key Features' section: 'You cannot gain gameplay advantage by spending real money in Path of Exile.' This alone is such a massive gamechanger, and in a good way. I don't know about you, but I don't particularly tend to enjoy games which incorporate a 'pay to win' mentality. Sure it isn't absolutely necessary to shell out any additional cash to be sucessful in D3, but just the fact that it is an option eventually helped drive me and many others away. Also, let's be honest - the loot system in D3 was (and still is) horrendous and only serves to further the agenda of Diablo 3's Real Money Auction House (which they are finally going to do away with early next year along with most likely bettering your chances of finding good gear). Go figure that! Anyway I digress, this isn't about D3. I only mention it because if you intend to play an ARPG on the PC, it's probably going to be one of these two. What you need to know is that PoE offers a truly rewarding and deep experience throughout. Character development boasts outstanding flexibility and viability of unique builds with a complex and rich skill-point system coupled with ability gems that allow you to specifically tailor any class in the game to be played the way you prefer. Of course some work better than others, but that's just how it goes. In summation, whether you are tired of D3 and looking for your ARPG fix elsewhere or just plain want a fun new game to play in this genre, do yourself a favor and click 'Play Game.' After all, who needs to be convinced by reviews from strangers when you can experience it yourself for free?",

            "review_text": "*This review was for the 'Sacrifice of Vaal' It has since been updated (A lot) and I look forward to updating the review*  Hello Close friends and strangers of the internet, I'm back from Melbourne and, after 16 hours of gaming in the back seat of my car, feel the need to review the game 'Path of Exile.' Let's get started  I'd like to preface this review by saying that This Game Is Free. You've got nothing to lose by installing it.  'Path of Exile' is a Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game (I could have said 'MMO RPG' but I sound like a legitimate game critic when I say it like that) Which I'm sure is a genre that we've all had our experiences in (Runescape, Rift Ect.) I have to say out of all the games I've played in this genre, this one is done very well. The mechanics are commendable but not overly different, the storyline and variation of the missions, average. The graphics aren't fantastic, but hey, it's a free game. What do you expect? I'm yet to try out the Co-op (Mainly because I have a serious lack of friends) But the duelling system is fairly balanced and fair and overall, games like this are just generally addicting  Now, I know your probably losing interest because this is sounding like every other MMO RPG but hold on, I'm getting to the good stuff  The best thing about this game is easily the passive skill tree. I know that sounds underwhelming but trust me, It could take days to plot a good path through this thing, I'm just trying to guess which direction I should head but in reality, this skill tree is so big it doesn't even fit on my computer screen. It's taken me 10 hours to figure out how the class and items work together (shown directly below.)  Forgive me if I’ve gotten this wrong, I've only played through the first act as a witch (Yeah, I'm still a noob)  I like to think of the class system as a colour wheel. There are 3 primary classes (one focused on intelligence, one on strength and one on dexterity) and 3 secondary classes, each one composed of 2 others (The duellist focuses on Strength and dexterity, the cleric focuses on strength and intelligence and the thief focuses on dexterity and intelligence.) These different classes all dictate where you start on the passive skill tree, shaped like a colour wheel. Most of the powerful items are clearly designed for a certain class as the all require a combination of the three traits (Intelligence, strength and dexterity) One that only requires intelligence is obviously designed for the person who is starts in the middle of the 'Intelligence' area in the passive skill tree Whereas an item that requires dexterity and strength is made for the class which is a combo of dexterity and strength.  Wow, that probably confused the F*ck out of you guys, it's really difficult to explain, it's so complex you could spend hours researching it.  The items all have combinations of 3 different traits (Wow, the developers must've really liked the number 3!) Evasion, energy shield and amour. Evasion determines how likely you are to dodge an attack, Amour determines how much of the damage is block and energy shield reminds me a lot of the 'overshield' from Halo or Mass Effect. It exists and if attacked, the energy shield is drained rather than your health. When the energy shield is depleted, you will have no defences other than your amour and evasion skills. The energy shield will restore after a period of not being attacked. However, your health will regenerate very slowly regardless of which items you wear. Each of the traits the amour has (Evasion, Amour and Energy shield) Link up to the traits the class has (Dexterity for Evasion, Amour for strength and Energy shield for intelligence) This is not a set rule but most items will have a requirement to meet.  Are you still following me? If you're not, it's okay. Even If I confused you, you’re probably noticing how in-depth this game is.  Finally, slots of amour have different coloured gem slots. There are three different coloured gems (So many ♥♥♥♥ING THREES!) And 3 different coloured gems (AHHHHHHH) which all link up to the 3 traits of the classes (I think I'm developing a '3' fetish) The red gems are usually for Melee combat, the green ones are for archery and the blue ones for magic. Some monsters resist certain types of these abilities, some resist fire, frost or lightning. Some monsters also can summon smaller units, perform similar abilities to what the player can perform and some monsters have energy shields.  Okay, I'm done. Thanks for reading if you made it this far. Click the like button if you did. I swear, it took ages to write this out and last review I did, not a single person liked it :(. I strongly recommend this game for all people who love a good MMO RPG. I would love to have one of my close friend (Jacob, Brodie, Dom, Josh, Lachlan, Sam, I'm looking at you guys.) to pick up this game so that I wouldn't have to continue this crazily confusing experience alone.   All in all, because it's a free game I'm giving it an 8.5/10",

This is one of the best Hack 'n Slash Action RPG games that you will find this year and what's more it is entirely free to play (yes a real free to play the only thing you pay real money for are cosmetics like extra gore, different skin on items so that you look a little unique, pets that do nothing but follow you or more warehouse slots etc).   The gameplay it self is pretty much Diablo 2 style. One amazing thing about the game to note is the skill tree and the way you can develop it... the possibilities are endless! Basically the skill tree is just passive skills while the spells and similar that you use to fight are 'gems' which you have to embed in your weapons/armors, what's more is that there are no class bound items so basically you can make a Ranger use staffs and use magic, a Marauder use bow and a Witch use a giant sword and that's not all, every single class has the same skill tree with the class being just the way you character looks and the starting possition in the skill tree.  The skills in this game are amazing. To use a skill you have to find a gem with that skill, meet the level and stat requerments and put it inside a gem slow in your weapon/armor. Each weapon/armor can have up to 4/6 slots with 3 different color and skill gems also have 3 different color types (based on Strength, Dexterity and Intelligence) and those slots on the weapon can be linked together so you can merge 2 or 3 different skills effects (using support gems with normal skills gems) to add new type of effects to your skills and make them even stronger. The crafting and currency systems in the game are really unique and awesome the normal currency used in other games like gold for example is totally removed and everything revolves around trading items and the currency items are the same as upgrade items (adding new options to you armor/weapons, socketing, changing their type from normal, magic, rare ..etc)  PoE is definitely my favorite Hack 'n Slash game together with the classic Diablo 2. It's a must try game for RPG fans and I would recomend it to all of you ;).",

            "review_text": "Long story short, this is one of the most engaging games I've played in many years. Path of Exile is a nearly perfect blend of intelligent complexity and mass destruction. It's probably not so intricate that a disinterested player wouldn't be able to find enjoyment, but it's certainly geared toward those who are inclined to plan, research, experiment, and occasionally fail in order to really flesh out their experience with the game.  And, as you've probably noticed, Path of Exile is completely free with no strings attached; the download is free, there's no subscription, expansions and patches are free (and frequent), and will remain so until the Earth burns up in a few billion years. The only things you can possibly buy with real money are almost exclusively cosmetic features, such as different visual effects for certain spells, visual affects for your character/gear, passive pets, etc. The only two non-cosmetic exceptions I can think of are increased and customizeable storage space in your 'stash' that's shared between characters (you start with four pages in the stash, which is not at all restrictive), and extra character slots (I don't even know how many character slots you start with, but I think I have eight characters and haven't yet seen the cap). If there were ever a situation where you get to 'vote with your money,' it's this. Ever bought a game and been disappointed but you already spent your cash? Ever wish you could have just played for hours on end without paying a dime just to see if the game is worth your time? This is part of what I love about Grinding Gear Games and their Path of Exile. Now that I've played a significant portion of the game I'm completely in love, and I'm fully justified in paying for some of the cosmetic features just so that I can help support the game and the dev team. I actually WANT to hand them my money at this point. And the best part is that I can pay however much I want, anything from $5 on up in exchange for microtransaction currency/coins, and even still get something extra for that money, like a mohawk made of spiked daggers or a crazy new look for my primary spell. Play for free, completely, forever, and if you do ever decide to give them some money you'll still be getting bonus stuff for a game you already love. It's simply amazing.  The passive skill tree can be a little daunting even after a serious investment in the game, but it also becomes rather intuitive and you just get a sense for how to operate within it. Grinding Gear Games' Path of Exile website has the complete interactive skill tree on it so that you can play around and experiment without having to risk your character to do so, though you will have to (really easily) copy-paste the link to a seperate website to get a list of how it all translates in terms of your hp, increased damage, resistances, and so on.  To describe the systems far more simply, and probably more boringly, than they deserve, Path of Exile essentially works like so, from my perspective.   1) Pick a class. Classes only differ in terms of their appearances, their starting stats, and where within the web of the passive skill tree they start, but not in terms of what abilities they can acquire or what parts of the skill tree they can reach.  2) Work the Skill Tree. This passive skill tree seems to be a pretty significant divergence from your standard fare where one would usually expect to be able to specialize by putting points into certain abilities; instead, as you level up you put your points into qualities and abilities that work in the background of your character. Most of these passives are individually fairly mundane, but many of them can single-handedly change the way your character will function.  3) Use your skills. Your abilities come in the form of specialty items that you can acquire through quests, random drops, or player trades, just like your equipment, and there are tons of them. Further, these ability items (gems) get placed on your armor essentially in sequences of your choosing such that they can have their effects altered.  4) Horde, and use, your currency. There's no gold in this game, which also means you won't find any gold farmers. The items that get used as currency are all things that you can actually use in the game to do stuff, not just a medium for transactions like gold would be. Each currency item does something different; among others, some of the currencies (orbs) can be used to upgrade a common item to a rare item, reroll the stats on a rare item, change the socket colors or socket links on an item, improve item quality, and so forth. These currencies are random drops as well as acquired by selling your gear or trading other currency items to NPC vendors, as well as by trading with players.  4) Rock your gear. The equipment is far more interesting than most any game I've played for two reasons. First, you can change any item in any way, though doing some of this can be quite difficult to achieve, such that you can take a perfectly common item and turn it into an amazing piece of equipment with your currency orbs; this significantly changes the standard 'farm until it drops' scenario that these types of games usually run into. Second, the ability gems have specific colors and they go into the same color sockets on armor such that blue gems go into blue sockets, green into green, and red into red (there are only three color types); the number, color, and connections between the sockets can do everything from simply allowing you to use multiple skills to significantly changing the way one or many skills operate. Equipment also has all the normal stuff you'd expect in a game like this, like various defensive or offensive stat bonuses, the occasional skill bonus, or whatever else. And, again, you get to alter all of the elements of your items, like taking a common item that has the sockets you want and upgrading it from a common item to a rare item, then if you don't like the random stats on your new rare item you can reroll the stats, or change the colors and orientations of the sockets, and so on. You're never, ever just stuck with whatever equipment happens to be dropping for you. Putting these qualities together makes for the least boring gearing system I've seen.  Now you roll all this stuff into one game and you get a really complex and compelling experience with a massive amount of customizability and replayability. Each aspect influences the others and there are absolutely no restricting ways to play your character. Spread yourself across the passive skill tree, then put abilities on your gear to compliment your spec; or find abilities you really want to use and then spec in the skill tree to augment or alter how they work. Define the type of character you're going to play ahead of time and restrict yourself to just those types of items, abilities, and passive skills; or flow through the game and define yourself as you go. There are definitely many specific paths that some people prefer, or some that are easier, or more defensive, or more offensive, pet based, supporting, etc., but you will find absolutely no shortage of wild and crazy speculative or even wildly divergent safe/noob-friendly specs on the forums or elsewhere online.  But all of these intricacies mean that you'll get the most out of Path of Exile by spending some time researching, whether it's scouring the forums or just watching some YouTube vids of people playing and explaining their particular character build. The more you learn, the more the game opens up and starts to seem even more and more exciting. I've put over 100 hours in at this point and, no matter how much I think I know, I search for something I'm uncertain about and find a whole new aspect of the game that I hadn't even considered yet. I see myself playing Path of Exile far into the future, and will support the game and the dev team with my money by choice, at my own",

            "review_text": "Playing the game since open beta, much more before Steam release. Real 'Free to play', forgot pay to win stuff. After months of playing i can assure you it is the best action RPG i have ever played. A lot of people will compare it with Diablo but for me its much more. First of all game have amazing community and developers who are patching and fixing all issues on a regular base. To be honest i never saw a company ready to listen the community.   Before you start playing for real you should definitely register at official forums, check out guides about game mechanics, builds and gameplay tips. You should also drop a look at offical forum shops for gear trade threads, deals between players.  One thing that makes this game unique is customization. Passive and active skills can be combined in thousand different ways to make your character exactly as you want him to be, no strict classes. Every single active skill can be modified to work the way you want and match your passive skill setup.  Since there is no standard currency like gold or cash, developers decided to implement very interesting currency type - orbs, many different orbs. Each orb type have its primary use for crafting gear mods, thats the main reason people started to use them as a currency.  After great community and customization options i would like to point out trade and bargain as a second most important thing in Path Of Exile. To gear up your character fast and build immortal god of hack and slash you should follow the trade chat and official forum trade threads, learn how to buy and sell, dont hesitate to bargain and earn profit. Work on your bargain skills and you will progress much faster.  I could really say a lot about it since game content is huge and nicely polished. These first few lines i mentioned was something that really impressed me. Its something that makes a difference between huge, deep games like this one that are obviously made for action RPG community and all other games released exclusivley for building up the company profit.  This is one of those games made for community. From gamers for gamers  Have fun!",

            "review_text": "Aparently the game was made by the same team that made Diablo2 (which isnt the one that made Diablo3).  It really is D2's sucessor, the gameplay is pretty similar with the single big diference being the character customization. You can make literally anything you want, from a necromancer templar to a dual wielder dealing elemental damage.   Since i was such a big fan of D2 back in the day, i had to try this game. If you dont want to read all of it, skip to the end.  You have several classes to play, the one you pick basically sets where you start on the passive skill tree. At the end of chapter 3, you unlock the Scion class, which is the most versatile and can easy become whatever you want.  When you level up you get points you can use on the passive skill tree to make your character stronger. The passive skill tree is truly gigantic, hence the huge variety of choices when building your char.  You also get gems, that you slot into your items. Each gem has a skill, and the gems level up as you do. You can connect gems for extra effects, as there are many 'support' gems, that dont do anything for themselves but enhance other gems, with damage, skill duration, blinding enemies, extra effects like making melee single target skills splash for targets around, etc. There are 3 types of gems and gem slots, red, green, and blue, red being typically the 'brute' ones and therefore require strength, the greens require dexterity, and the blues inteligence. This gem system is very versatile, just like the passive skill tree.  The game currently has 4 chapters. While chapter 1 and 2 are kinda easy, chapter 3 gets harder, and final boss on chapter 4 is pretty damn hard.  So lets sum it up:  Pro's: -Easy to play. -Highly character customization. Want to shoot a cone of fireballs as wide as the screen, that also deal lighting and cold damage? Want to have an army of zombies, spirits and totems? Miss your whirlwhind D2 barbarian and want it back, but now dealing elemental damage? Yes please madam. -Free to play. -Areas change, so each time you replay each area the map is different.  Cons: -Visual perks like wings and stuff is paid, like guild chest, or extra chest tabs(but you start with 4 so that is hardly an issue). -Takes a while to learn and master the gem system, but once you get rolling you can make truly amazing things. -Gets kinda boring after a while. So just start another class lol.",

            "review_text": "Path of Legends is another great indie game to add to EA's records of acheivement. You start of with a selection from various characters, these include lulu the dark witch, taric the holy one, and lastly master yi the forgoten avanger. I myself played as yi and the story is great although it does have a few plot holes here and there. In any case you find yourself on a beach after the summer cruise ship you were on got assaulted by the deadswamp pirates. Yi was engaged to be married and had all of his family onboard the cruise at the time. unfortunately the pirates were ruthless and slayed every man woman and child. Yi tried to resist but was overpowerd by a surge of lightening on the stormy night that accompanied the deadswamp pirate assault. Amongst the wreckage of the ship he eventually floated to the island in which you start the game. Theres nothing much to it at first, you are lying face planted in the dirt. You learn to survive as you craft with various tools. Immersion breaks here because you cut down trees with your bare hands, but i suppose this could be attributed to Yi being a badass and so it can be justified.  Eventually you can build yourself a nice hut, and after you do some rather grindy farming you can establish a good forward outpost. You get promted mid game to purchase station cash from the soney online entertainment website to speed things up, but i never was a fan of DLC so i dont support EA's decision to monetise indie games like this. After you build the foward outpost you get to fight the first boss, a giant enemy crab which is symbolic of Yi's personal struggles from his japanese heritage. the crab is symbolic of real historical battles in ancient china and for the little historian in all of us i found this quite compelling as a plot twist. beating the crab allows you to advance to the next section, where you meet rico from just cause 2.   Rico gives you the grappleing hook as he too was on the cruise ship but took a bullet to the hip and just cant do what he did in the previous game. Fortunately for us, Yi gets to swing around the area pretty quickly. the hook allows you to make it to the central island, where the plot thickens once Yi discovers theres an american military base centred in the area that has been testing equipment. Yi appraoches the base in a freindly manner, but is instantly gunned down and escapes within an inch of his life. The game turns toward gurrilla warfare fromt his point on. You need to take out key military instillations over the island (such as propaganda stations and fuel depots) to try and win over the local populus. Once youve garnered enough strength you can take the military hq head on to liberate panaoa from the terrorist organisation that has rooted itself in the heart of the island.  THe final stages of the game involve strolling the halls of the HQ, which span deep underground. Yi uncovers the secrets this place holds. the organisation were responsible for the pirate attack on the ship, hired mercinaries trying to obtain a rare artifact being transported on the cruise that nobody knew about. This clearly explaines why rico was onboard and this was certainly no ordinary cruise. The artifact was being used to reanimate flesh to create necromongers to satisfy some weird cult called zoology established by Tom ultman. From this point on Yi knew what he had to do and where he needed to go... space... THe game ends with Yi having a choise to destroy the evil facility, or instead render it inert for future research by the alliance which hope to harness this power against the bretheren moons. Once you make your choice you can hitch a ride on the ebon normandy, a test vehicle in the hanger which is fully developed and primed for space flight. YOu can take with you some local aquaintances you met on the island, or just go solo. In any case, you leave the island and make your way to eden prime, and this is the basis for the second installment of league of exiles which we here at indieholic ardently await to get our greasy little hands on.  until next time, stay snazzy gamerz!",

Except that the grid itself is... ridiculously big.  And if you are just playing casually, you can use it to develop your character in ways you want. But if you are fairly serious, you will need to find out ways to actually build effective and efficient characters, having entire trees planned beforehand.  And then you will need to get quite lucky or trade successfully, because skills are not bound to a character. That is both the game's greatest strength and greatest weakness, in my opinion. The skill system is INCREDIBLY flexible, being more similar to FF7's materia system than anything else.  Skills come in the form of 'virtue gems', which you get to slot into items with the appropriate colored slots. Said gems mostly come in rare, random drops.  You either need to trade for them (easier now since there are vendors that do sell some useful gems now), win many of them on quests, or trade with the community.  Extremely flexible, and if diablo 2 gameplay mixed with FF7 skill systems and FFX sphere grid character growth sounds interesting, you will probably devote many many hours in this title.  The ingame shop is only for cosmetic items, storage space and character slots, as far as I know, so there is no such thing as a pay to win scheme in this game.  EXTREMELY recommended.",

To start with, the game took five minutes to start up every time. My friend's game took around 2-3 minutes and his PC is top notch. So you're looking at very high startup times unless you're running an SSD. Also, changing graphic settings might freeze or crash the game. This happened when trying to use windowed fullscreen or turning anti-aliasing on. I ended up having to play just plaing old windowed mode. High startup times are a problem for this type of game.  The game itself is like Diablo 2 on shrooms. The combat felt slow and unresponsive, and the animations were clunky. Not something you'd expect from an Action RPG. The enemies are your classic goatmen, skellingtons, zombies and swarmy bugs. Sometimes the enemies are rare or unique. Even The Butcher made an appearance (only he was called Brutus but I know he was The Butcher), The setting is grimdark, as it should be.  By the way, the graphics are amazing.

It's possible to build almost any way you want using this, but each class has passive skills which you're meant to specialize in (i.e. are easier to access). Microtransactions exist, of course, but have no real impact on the game, unless you count extended stash space. Also, has perhaps the most unique health potion system I've seen which I'd like to see done elsewhere. Your potions have X charges and use a set amount of charges per use of the potion. These charges replenish as you kill enemies. Furthermore, these potions are stored in their own separate inventory.  Basically, if you're interested in this style of game and have the hard drive space, there's not much reason to not AT LEAST try it out. Afterall, if you don't like it, you're out nothing but your own time. Only complaint at the moment is that like Diablo 3, it is online only, which means the servers aren't local and it's possible to run into bits of lag here and there, even with fairly good internet speeds.",

            "review_text": "POE is like no other dungeon crawler I've ever played. The passive tree and skill gems are such unique character building mechanics that they became my favorite part of the game. The currency system has been excellently designed too; each unit of value is not only valuable because it is money but because currency itself is expendable for varying magical effects on your items, transportation etc. The graphics are beautiful and controls are easy to pick up/remappable. Some monsters, especially dungeon bosses can be very challenging (not to mention on higher difficulties - Cruel, Merciless) and take multiple tries to beat. The game lets you spawn back into the dungeon with damage you've already dealt persisting on the bosses so eventually you can brute force it if that's what you want to do, unless you are on Hardcore, in which case - Permadeath. Home building is mainly a neat distraction and hub for the Masters you can use to more easily craft powerful gear. My only complaint is that progressing through the whole life of a character to the end game requires that you do the same quest/storyline several times in a sort of new game plus style. The storyline is not bad by any means, in fact the world lore and theme is pretty cool but it can start to get repetitive. One of the best things about it, I've never spent a single dime and I get the same gameplay that anyone else who spends money on it does, because the majority of purchases available, other than more stash room (not necessary they give you plenty) are cosmetic only.  Highly highly recommend to anyone who enjoys dungeon crawlers, and to anyone who hasn't tried one before, why not give it a shot? Free-2-Play after all.",

The only items sold are cosmetics and stash storage space -- they're not cheap, but they don't impact the game.  There's a choice of 6 classes, which are presented to you much in the style of ol' Diablo 2: Templar, Shadow, Marauder, Ranger, Duelist and Witch. Unlike the old game, however, each class is very maleable and inter-changeable, in both passive skills and active abilities. The latter come in the form of gems, colour-code in regards to which attribute they adher to: green for Dexterity, red for Strength and blue for Intelligence. Each class has 2 initial direct paths of skills. A ranger, for instance, can choose to excel with bows, at range, or go the path of duel-wielding in melee combat. And at later stages, new, farther branches of passive skills are available to customize your character with, allowing you to mold your character's combat aptitude in detail. This might seem complex at first, but do not be drawn away, it's really quite simple and easy to map out. Lastly, I've noted nothing in the ways of bugs, glitches or significant imbalances.

I found that when I only had one character, it was pretty easy to stay within the limits of the default 4 tabs. After a hundred hours of gameplay, I felt like a small payment to be able to hoard more items was more than justifiable (and a bit more to make my new character look super cool!).

            "review_text": "Best action RPG out there right now, but not without its problems:  PoE requires too much dedication for hard working students and people with jobs or a family who want to maintain a healthy lifestyle. If you don't have a lot of time on your hands, you're better off playing some other game because you won't get much out of PoE.  The skill tree doesn't offer as much freedom as it first appears to. While the overall selection does greatly affect how your character works under the hood, they are still passive skills, most of which are just tiny percentage buffs and seriously underwhelming on their own.  I'm not a fan of D3, but the active skills in PoE do not satisfy like D3's do. There aren't any active skills that really make me want to build a PoE character.  In PoE you tend to build a character around one attack and spam that single one until you're blue in the face. Other action RPGs typically offer combined use of more active skills.  PoE is a thinking person's game, challenging, huge depth in its mechanics. It takes a long time and a lot of reading to learn how to create strong characters and it takes forever to get characters to a high level. The learning process is a joy, but respeccing isn't really doable.  The game changes a lot. If you leave the game and return after some months, you'll need to relearn wat makes a strong character, and all your character's passive skill trees will have been reset because the game's skill tree was likely updated. Your characters won't function until you reinvest those skillpoints. After returning to the game you likely won't know the current trade value of items.The game doesn't comfortably let you take a few months off and then come back.  They went too crazy with the socket colours and linked sockets. While fun at first, the impossibly low odds of getting the right sockets and links on your gear become an annoying limiting factor to how you build your character. Specifically, part of the problem is that the type of defence stat (armor, energy shield, or evasion) on a gear item determines what socket colour is most likely to show up on it. Active kills are gems that need to be socketed before you can use them, and they will only fit in sockets of the matching colour. This effectively forces you to focus on a specific defence type based on what active skills you want to use, severely restricting the endless freedom that the passive skill tree initially appears to provide.",

Path of exile lends it self to very deep builds and theorycrafting, which hardcore players will adore. Skills are collected from the world either from quests, drops or from trading with players. These skills are called 'skill gems' and begin as your fundamental action rpg spells. You will later acquire support gems which will provide unqiue abilites to the skill gems resulting in some nice effects adding to the games fluid combat. The game offers an in game store, however this is purely cosmetics based and storage space extensions which is initially huge anyway, offering no 'pay to win' bonuses. After a few run throughs (i did about three messing up all three characters after and before release) and starting a new character today, i felt the repetitive nature of the story and dungeons, and caverns overwhelm me.

Every waking moment of my life was spent grinding my way to max level on all characters, gathering immense amounts of loot, and playing around with friends for hours at a time. The game offered me massive amounts of reward, enjoyability, and replayability. So, naturally, when I heard that Blizzard was coming out with a new Diablo game, I thought my prayers had been answered. No more watered-down Triple-A games; this was it, my love of gaming was supposed to pool back into me with Diablo III.   Then I was disappointed - severely disappointed. Diablo III was nothing like the game I had played back in the day and I couldn't understand how Blizzard could screw up something so beautiful. With nothing left to turn to, I sauntered about the internet, searching for the ARPG that would take me away from the pain Blizzard had brought to myself. Torchlight was decent, but nothing too special. Drakensang was okay, but nothing to write home about.   Then I stumbled upon Path of Exile. I was hesitant, to be honest with you. The game looked solid from the screenshots, but I could never really know unless I downloaded it. Let me tell you, after 400 hours of this game, this is completely raising the standards for ARPGs and nothing (as of the date on this review) could ever come close to the quality of this game.      A massive skill tree, making for complete build diversity.     Overwhelmingly brilliant, lore-based atmospheres.     Visually stunning; what Diablo should have been.

This is what Diablo III should have been and wishes it was. If you're not sold yet, go ahead and download the game for a trial run. Every bit of content is free and there's nothing to lose. I guarantee you won't ever regret it.   Update for Atlas of Worlds   My review was done before the Atlas of Worlds expansion hit and I would like to reassure anyone wondering: yes, this expansion is amazing and, yes, the game is still just as good as it has always been.",

            "review_text": "Overview: Path of Exile This game is technically an MMO, but you will seldom encounter other players unless you choose to invite them to a squad with you. If it weren't for global chat, you may or may not realize that anyone else even owns the game while you're not in a major city. The gameplay is very dungeon-crawler(esque) with a good deal of lootfest and skill tree elements. Storyline: lol didn't read it, nobody has time for that (doubting anyone has time to read reviews either, but these devs deserve the time it took to give the review). Difficulty: initially there is only a normal difficulty, but a character can access a higher difficulty (cruel, the merciless) after beating the quest line on their current difficulty. Additionally, you can create normal or hardcore characters, the difference being that hardcore characters recieve better loot, but on death, they convert to standard characters, and all their gear becomes standard gear (and cannot be traded back to a hardcore character).  Pros:  1) Microtransactions aren't needed for late game.. in fact, there is nothing you can buy with money that results in an in-game advantage beyond a larger storage chest.  2) Character Balance and Variety. There are nearly infinite amounts of viable character builds and skills, not just 2-3 'use these or always lose' web builds for 'op classes' - from what I've seen, the classes are surprisingly well balanced. 3) Community. There are usually a lot of people chatting in global, and many people are willing to provide help either in-game or just give advice on items if you're inclined to ask. As always on the internet, there's a healthy amount of salt, and a few trolls, but such is the price we pay for gaming with other people. 4) Audio. The ambient sounds and the soundtracks for the game are both excellent, and the character attack sound effects manage to avoid being irritating although you end up hearing the same ones hundreds of times in the course of an hour. 5) Details. The devs clearly spent enough time in other games to understand what's annoying in an mmo, and they did their best to remove those elements. Most notably, potions don't clutter your inventory - instead, you can carry up to 5 potions, which refill as you slay enemies. The game doesn't have currency, instead players trade with chaos/fusing orbs, materials which can actually be used to upgrade items, rather than exclusively be used for buying and selling.  Cons: 1) Repetition. Although the creatures and attacks change, but essentially every level plays out the same. It's quite grind-heavy in that even if you progress through new areas as soon as you finish the quests, the actual gameplay remains redundant. 2) Actually.. being bored by the redundancy of combat is my only complaint. Although boredom is a death sentence in most games, I think I'll still keep playing this one... and even if you do quit if you become bored, there's easily 20 hours of early-game content which you'll probably complete before reaching that point.",

Now, I've enjoyed a few (wrote a review a couple of months back for Titan Quest which I still think is a great game), but this one is by far the most reminiscant of the greatest of them all.  Where this game surpasses all others is flexibility. With the enormous passive tree and the skill gem and linking system the possibilities are nearly endless. and these possibilities exist for each class.  Now I must also add, the one weakness of the game is also in its flexibility. It's entirely possible to build a character that will become useless past a certain difficulty. It can be very hard to get the correct gear in combination with skill gems that will fit in that gear. But these challenges just increase the reward when you get something that works, rather than guaranteeing you with a functional build from the get go by boxing you into a very specific path (a la Diablo 3... and no hate for D3 it's just an entirely different beast)  btw... this is FREE. So even if the good only sounds okay and the bad sounds really rough, it's still worth it.",

            "review_text": "This game is so ridiculously good. I started playing it in beta before it was on Steam after a friend introduced me to it, and the game has grown so much since then. It has so many unique things to offer. For those who want to know more...I will attempt to explain some of the things you will need to know from the start. It may sound daunting, but it isn't as difficult to pick up as it sounds.  A quick sidenote. Yes, it's free. No, it's not pay to win. There isn't a single thing in the store that gives an advantage over other players. It's filled with a ton of cosmetics, bank tabs, and character slots. None of which you will actually need, they're just nice to have.  For starters, there is the incredibly large passive skill tree with over 1300 passives on it. All 7 characters are positioned in different spots on this skill tree. The 'pure' characters are positioned on the passive skill tree directly within the three core attributes. The Marauder with strength, the Ranger with dexterity, and the Witch (my personal favorite) with intelligence. The 'hybrid' characters are the Duelist with strength/dexterity, the Templar with strength/intelligence, the Shadow with dexterity/intelligence, and the Scion (who isn't unlocked until later in the game) with strength/dexterity/intelligence. There are also jewels which can be socketed into the passive skill tree, that grant various buffs and abilities and sometimes alter other passives within a certain radius.  Next is your equipment. Weapons, armor, accessories, and flasks. There's a ton of possible stats you can get, and every weapon and armor piece will have a random amount of colored sockets on them, some linked together and some not (I will explain that more later as it ties in with your active skills). As for the flasks, you can have up to five equipped and those are what you use to replenish your health and mana. There's also some with a more niche purpose.  Your active skills come in the form of skill gems. These gems come in three colors: red, blue, and green. And what colors are those sockets on your weapons and armor? Red, blue, and green. You get skill gems as drops and quest rewards, and then socket them in the apropriately colored slot on your equipment. A piece of equipment can have anywhere from one to six sockets on it, depending on a number of factors. And if multiple sockets are linked together, then the gems in those sockets can work together. For example, you could have a skill gem that lets you raise a zombie, and then another one linked to that which makes your zombie do more damage.  The story is great, the soundtrack is cool, the NPCs are awesome. The game has full voice acting. Overall things have a really dark and gritty theme to it, and it's done very well. The enemies and bosses and even the areas get progressively more and more creepy. There's currently a total of four acts, each with their own unique things to offer.  There is so much more I could talk about, I've barely scratched the surface. The Forsaken Masters, corrupted areas, Divination cards, hideouts, leagues/events, the barter system (no actual currency in the game), all the items that can be used to alter your equipment, plus the special maps for endgame...but you can learn it for yourself when you play.",

            "review_text": "Path of Exile is a very interesting game. With heavy emphasis on mirroring a big portion of Diablo II's successes, Path of Exile presents itself as a serviceable and even downright appealing in a truly Free-to-Play game focusing on the idea of 'Ethical Microtransactions.'  As an action-RPG, it naturally gets compared to the likes of Diablo III, with a lot of players touting the oft-uttered 'This is what Diablo III should have been' among forumgoers. The comparison is hard to avoid since the game has similar mechanics but with a stronger emphasis on having choices with consequence.  Visually, the game's aesthetic is much more dark. In line with it's inspiration for gothic architecture and a lot of depressing atmospheres. Proper use of lighting to provide contrast in dark places in junction with lighting reduction as you're damaged really brings in the sense of dread when you are outnumbered and it becomes a matter of seconds before you die.  The game's soundtrack is absolutely stunning. They blend well with the environments without sounding far too similar to that of it's inspiration. Ambient audio also adds another line of what sounds like a full range of what belongs in each stage.  The passive skill tree is daunting at first, but once you manage to realize it's merely a presentation that can overwhelm you and that everything goes from point-to-point, it becomes fairly simple to figure out how to use it. Each class starts in a position and moves along the 'rails' one by one as they gain levels and skill points. Choices are fairly permanent, which is quite refreshing in an age where games continually make such decisions meaningless by offering people a chance to try again with no dedication.  Active skills could be compared to things like Final Fantasy VII's materia system. Each piece of gear will have a slot, which is color-coded for gem type. Green, Blue, Red, or elusive Whites. Some are support gems that enhance active abilities. Some are trigger gems, ones that cause an effect when triggered by play. All of which gain XP and level up when you use them.  Despite being a Free to Play game, Path of Exile manages to hold fairly fast to it's 'Ethical Microtransactions' platform which is to say that none of their purchasable items are to give any mechanical benefit. While people can argue that character slots (of which you start with 24) and stash tabs (of which you start with 4, and can be fine with) are a mechanical advantage, the game is very much 'Free to Play' in the literal sense. Gear drop rates are not based on cash spent. Drop quality is not based on cash spent. You can't buy better gear, and you can't buy experience potions.  So, Path of Exile has so far proven itself tremendously. It does a great job keeping itself reigned in, shying away from the easy-money route that other Free-to-Play games do, while providing an experience that even the bigger powerhouses in the market failed to provide.  Play this game. If you loved Diablo II, you'll be hard pressed to not enjoy this.",

            "review_text": "It was the summer of 1997, i was 11 years old; one night, at some friends of friends house, in a dark room, a bright monitor enlighted me the path, a wierd music attracted me to the PC; there i saw Diablo for the first time. I feel in love with it at first sight. When a friend told me they were making a sequel, i actually started useing internet for the first time; i never had a reason to connect before, now i was seeking every piece of information about Diablo II. It was summer, it was hot, and in my hands i had a copy of Diablo II, i was one of the most happy nerdfag ever seen. I don't know why but i started playing on-line as first experience (the phone bill was bad that summer, very bad); after that, i played for other 4-5 years that harsh evil game called Diablo II, both in soft and hard-core. It was around 2008 when i saw the website of Diablo III, a brief video of a Barbarian smashing enemies, with havok, sparkles and all. Couldn't wait so i started playing D2 again, and again until 2012, when Diablo III came out. With all my friends we were there, ready to have it. We were there, on team speak, playing hard, but the feel was kinda different, we couldn't tell what was it; we were playing the new chapter, the last piece of the story, with new mechanics and all; but something wasn't there, i played hundreds of hours but couldn't find it anywhere in it; it was passion. The passion to make every detail matter, every little piece of the puzzle match the greater design. This is Path of Exile, an artistic passionate song to a game genre that was dying; Grinding Gear Games picked their favourite game, which i guess is Diablo II, and from its ashes, they made something truly new and innovative.  (I don't play PoE on steam, i play it on their original Launcher, got many chars above 85, some also HC)",

            "review_text": "This is a complete head-scratcher. It's been around too long to not have a succesful business model, but I'm astonished at how ethical the microtransactions are in this F2P Diablo-alike.  No, no hyperbole, I'm truly astonished. I mean, it's almost hard to  find  the microtransactions, and they come in three flavors: Extra character slots, extra equipment tabs, and cosmetic appearances.  I don't know how many character slots PoE has, because playing one character is dozens of hours of playtime. Playing two (it's nice to have a 'solo' character and a 'co-op' character, which you can do without paying anything) is easily over 100 hours of playtime.  I still have enough stash tabs to organize my stuff into appropriate tabs. I might need more tabs some 200 hours into the game. Maybe?  And there's a huge amount of things to upgrade. Weapons and armor that has slots for skill gems, but also 'currency' items to buy items from vendors (no gold? Yes, no gold) that also affects your items. This helps the 'trash loot' and 'RNG gods' problems so much. If you find an item with great slots, but not enough else, you can enchant, disenchant, renchant, add more enchantments, craft on more enchantments, etc. If you find a great item with poor numbers of slots, you can reroll slot, reroll links, etc. How do you get these items in this Free-To-Play game, you ask?   ...from Grinding Gear Games, the answer is 'NOT by paying money. Ever.' You want those items, you find them or you trade for them. But wait, doesn't that create a third-party economy that might sell stuff out of channel? Maybe, but GGG resfuses to compromise the quality and feel of a game the depth of Diablo II to try and skim some profits.  The skill tree (web, really) is just bananas, too, in a great way. The selection of passive skills and abilities mixed with the equipment in this game encourages, again, Diablo II leves of creative character building, with a shocking amount of high-end viable oddball creations. (Just be aware of the vastly larger phase-space of useless characters you can make along the way, and assume you won't get your first character right. Really, it's okay).  The difficulty level make for a fun experience for those looking for a fun ARPG romp, but challenging theorycrafting challenges at the higher levels for hardcore players.  Best game I've played all year? Maybe. Most? Hands down.",

If you think of having 1000+hrs and tons of characters you might wanna think about that again, or you might just want to support the devs. The skill tree is huge. And by huge, I mean mastodontic, never before have I seen anything like it. Skills are obtained through Gems, which you'll find or be rewarded with. Vendors will trade items for the various in-game currencies, so no usual gold this time, so this might be weird for someone used to the classic currency system. Speaking of which, you'll find yourself troubled whether you should use the currency to upgrade your gear, or wait for better gear and purchase something else with the currency. The maps are randomized and quite large but it's pretty solid. Graphically speaking it is quite up to date and shouldn't lag. I turned off the chat, as it is quite useless for me since I don't think of playing the game so much, but you might wanna find a buddy to play with, as it is so much more fun to play together and you might have an easier time with bosses.  &gt;I'd rate it a 9/10 &gt;Pros: gameplay is solid and pretty polished, randomized instances, huge character customization, interesting currencies, isn't ruined by P2W microtransactions. &gt;Cons: often found myself crashing and having to restart the game, loading screen takes forever, might come across a bug or two, also with some quests when doing them together.

Basically, this, above all others, is the game that proves there is still life left in the ARPG genre. Full of fresh ideas in almost every facet of the game. The magic systemm, the skill tree, the commerce system, it all is done with a fresh take. The atmosphere is nice and dark, the game rarely has any serious difficulty spikes, and the devs forgot to (decided to forego) any pay to win model, which gave me a serious sigh of relief.  If you're a fan of ARPGs, give this a go, you won't regret it. ",

Right in the begining when you start a character, you automatically spawn near mobs, and have to kill your first boss in a matter of minutes. Though in Diablo, you get good equipment straight from the first boss you fight. In PoE, not so much, you get regular equipment. As you go on, you start to get better gear after fighting certain mobs, or bosses. Drops aren't all that high for certain items either. Honestly I like PoE better than Diablo, as it is a tougher game to things in and I do think other people will consider playing PoE too.",

            "review_text": "Cons: -Inflation. There is no in game gold and currency takes its value by 2 means: 1. by practical value in crafting items and 2. by rarity. Some of the orbs can be obtained by vendor recipes and others only by loot drops. This leads to the loot-based ones to have sky-rocketed prices. Its like selling a 500 euro bill for 600 1 euro coins. You won't spend it and you will trade it. In my opinion, either all currency should have vendor recipes (practical value based economy) or none (rarity based economy). There have been some efforts to change this, like the Masters' crafting system and the Divination cards but that’s not enough. -Legacy items. When a Unique (legendary) item is considered OP they DON’T nerf it. They nerf the potentially future drops of the Unique item with lower stats. This leaves a finite number of 'officially OP' items for the richest individuals to play with. I just don’t understand the reason behind this. -Desynchronization. Hopefully this will change with patch 2.0. -Character movement is too stiff. -Lore integration in gameplay shines in its absence. Although you have a lot of decisions to make in order to advance a build , there is literally only one plot based decision to make (the Bandits). -Different items use the same art. At least the 2D artwork could be different.  Pros: -Great community (don't be overhyped trolls exist everywhere). -The build possibilities are limitless. -They nailed it with the atmosphere. -Oh Gosh I love the soundtrack.  Overall a great game and I recommend to everyone to check it out. Just remember to have fun, enjoy the story, try exotic builds…and I strongly recommend not to dive deep into the economy, it has flaws and chances are you will end up disappointed.",

            "review_text": "I am currently closing in on 200 hours, and feel better positioned to give a full review of this game.  The basics: Free to play, and everything people were actually hoping for out of Diablo 3.  The visuals: The visuals are what you would consider current gen for PC. Gone are the murky levels and textures of D3, and in with something clean and more modern. I've had no issues with slowdown, and GGG are continually tweaking the video options to ensure the game perform well across most PC configurations.  The sound: Decent quality, although you might run into some issues with Creative cards. This won't come as a surprise to you if you're had Creative cards forever, but it might annoy you until you find out what the issue is, and the work-around. Creative owners know that Creative updates their drivers once every two years or so, and tend to leave huge bugs unpatches. That aside, the overall game sounds and soundtrack are high quality.  What makes this game different: An insanely deep skill tree, randomized maps, and an unlockable character after you complete your first run. Oh, and it's F2P, and no Pay 2 Win from the micro-transaction store.  Difficulty Scaling: Three grades of difficuly, and end game content is well flushed out. Once you complete your highest difficutly run, you can loop back for items and things you might have missed, or you can start running the handful of 'Maps' that dropped for you once you got past level 60. These maps have unique challenges attached, and can have their quality adjusted to increase their rewards.  Grinding Gear Games runs new leagues in seasons, one normal and one hardcore, with hardcore death causing your character to be moved to the permanenent 'normal' mode. These are often referred to by trolls 'scrubcore' and 'hardcore'. I prefer to think of them as 'drunkcore' and 'coffeecore'. The microtransaction store they utilize to keep the game alive and in development offers only cosmetic items, along with the usual stash upgrades, and is relatively unobtrusive. They run special 'races' on a regular basis, which allow you to compete for Unique prizes each season. These include special dungeon runs, races to top level/area, and coming soon, PVP tourneys.  Overall, this is an incredibly solid and addicting game, and if you're a fan of ARPGs overall, you might find yourself logging quite a few hours in this one.",

If however you are a beginner to this genre of games then i should reccomend a place with guides, ziggyd's youtube channel should have everything you want to know, but if you have any more queries then ask away in the game, the community there is great and willing to help new players out, i got so many people giving me items to try and nurse my first few bad chars along, but overall i'd give this game 9/10, the point is lost on desynch errors.",

You can create anything you want, if you have the currency for it. That's the catch though. In the beginning you will be really poor (99% of the time). Meaning the diversity is not that huge. There are a few builds that supposedly work without any gear due to abusing game's damage mechanics or using a very popular skill that outperforms other skills. The game is RNG based. And before I got around 200 hours into the game, I was really annoyed by this idea that my wealth is almost completely dependent on RNG. But then I started noticing things that the developers don't tell you and the community doesn't know. After that, the RNG factor became very minimal. Of course, that's my opinion. I got no proof, so maybe I just started getting lucky.   In the end. I had a blast leveling 3 characters from around 50 to around 90. I didn't have to start over, because I had characters that had free respecs.   I'd say that I recommend path of exile. I got a little off topic there, but it is worth it. There is no pay to win as far as I am aware and you can make your own luck. The only pay to win, kind of, is if you want to trade with other players more efficiently. But that's completely optional.  TL:DR Just go play it. Give it 200 hours, before you decide that you don't like it. The addiction to the loot chase will get you sooner or later and when it does, you will eventually be forced away like I was, due to bad RNG. And if you don't mind, then this is one of the few games that provides infinite entertainment. :)  ",

Using one of the best F2P models I've come across, the dev team has left me extremely impressed with the constant stream of updates. The skill gem system is very flexible with plenty of room for expansion. The in-game currency is built into the crafting system, which brings us back to the days of careful bartering rather than runaway gold inflation. Path of Exile is a great ARPG that stays true to its roots while not being afraid to branch out. That said, I have to actively avoid playing it. At the time of this review, I have been clean for 133 days.  The steady stream of content-driven expansions and challenge leagues means I can never quite put this game down. Damn you PoE, I'm a recovering slot-machine addict.",

Definitely has a wide variety of abilities and character skill customizations: You can make a caster go melee with heavy armor and a two-handed axe, and visa versa. You are not limited to any set of skills, weapons, or armor sets. You have the ability to travel the passive tree in any way shape or form as you please. The GGG team always keeps it's players up to date with news and future plans for the game, so you are never left in the dark, and they release expansions and updates every few months. They continue come up with new ideas to make the game more fun. Of course, it is a free to play game and they rely on their microtransaction store for income, and you are NOT required to purchase said items. They also have supporter packs for those who are interested in helping them grow.   However, this game is not one where you can simply 'hop' in and instantly start getting unique loot. In Path of Exile, you have to learn as you go, so expect to delete many characters and try not to get too attached to them, unless you have come up with a build that you absolutely love. There are forums and other 3rd party websites that can help you come up with ideas on how to create a specific build. They also have a Wiki page to help out as well. You will start to find out by level 60-ish that your build will either suck or be really good. If your build does have an issue, looks like it's back to the drawing board and try to figure out what was wrong and how you can make it better. Also, the currency system is not like a normal MMORPG, so there is no gold, copper, or silver and etc. It has an material exchange system where you can trade a few of one type of item for another. They even have a 'Master' system, which is where you can help out any of the 8 masters that they have by doing small quests. And when you get that said master to a certain level, you will be able to get your very own hideout based around the master of choice and you can decorate it as you please by purchasing decorations from them as well. Not only that, but each one has their own crafting table, which, depending on which master, lets you upgrade a specific type of gear. At level 8, your masters will start selling unique weapons and armor to you at a reasonable price.  Do not to worry, as soon as you get the hang of things, the game is a blast. The story is fantastic and very dramatic. There are tons of unique characters that you come across and help. There are huge bosses that you can fight as well. This is a game that tests your knowledge and witts. Are you ready for such a task? Can you survive through all the trials and conquer the labyrinth? Are you strong enough to go against the odds? If so, take a dive into Path of Exile and show them what you are made of. Oh, and also, watch your resistances as they play a major part on whether you live or die.",

And there is so much more, just check it out - if you are a die-hard ARPG fan, you won't regret choosing this game, trust me. The game IS NOT pay-to-win, there are microtransactions, but for cosmetical and account use, all the gear you can get with real cash, you can get in the game, while playing.

It follows the tried and tested gameplay formula of this genre with an interesting character development system.  Skills are based on gems that are found throughout the game.These need to be socketed into items to be used and these level up with you as long as they are socketed. In theory any class can use any skill (although skill level is limited by the appropriate stat). In addition to this there is a large passive skill matrix which is similar in style to the skill development in Final Fantasy 10 (If any of you remember that one). For those who don't, all character classes start at different places on the matrix and (in theory) can access any skill, although some skills are much easier to reach for certain classes. This means that character development is much more freeform than it is in a lot of other games of this type.   I've only played three classes to level 20 or so so I don't know how the game holds up in the final stages, but it seems like an enjoyable, nicely put together game so far. It has PVP (which I haven't tried), regular events and (apparantly) a sizeable number of players. If you find yourself at a loose end one day and fancy taking a chance on an indie game, I'd recommend giving this one a try. Its free to play and as far as I can tell not pay to win, so what have you got to loose :)",

The monster bashing and the item drops are highly rewarding and it doesn't waste your time by shoving cutscenes down your throat (unlike D3) to continue your advent to better gear.   Instead of active skillpoints you gain passive points to put in a massive web of skills. Although less instantly gratifying with earning passives for leveling, this is counteracted by receiving gems that act as active skills once you socket them in your gear. These gems are found either by completing quests or dropped by monsters you'ved killed. Any character can use any gem. Therefore the character you can build will be limitless.   I can't say enough about this game and how much I've already enjoyed it. There are currently 3 acts and and a 4th said to be implemented in 2014.

I find myself spending time outside of the game planning builds and discussing ideas with friends.  I started playing the game in softcore leagues. I was too afraid of dying and losing all of the work I had done in the league. After I became comfortable with the game and started to improve my skills I moved into hardcore leagues and haven't looked back. At the time of this review my current character is level 67 and just getting ready to move into doing maps.  Path of Exile's passive skill tree can be very daunting for a new player. It seems like you will never figure out what to do and feel overwhelmed. Many players use a guide on the forums from other players to learn how to play a certain build for a character and how to progress throughout the passive tree. Some people may say that having to look up how to play is bad but in my opinion it gets players to get more involved in the forums as well as into researching more about the game rather than just diving in and getting frustrated about not knowing what to do.  The economy of the game is kept balanced through the fact that the currencies commonly used for trading are also used by players to try and upgrade their items. This keeps the game from flooding with currency and having tons of inflation. Hardcore leagues tend to have a better economy since players dying takes items out of the league and puts it into standard. Causing the number of items that are good in standard to rise constantly, hurting it's economy some.  Even though Path of Exile has a limited number of classes and only 3 acts that are repeated multiple times per character and on every character, the passive tree, skill gem customization, and items cause people to want to keep playing the game and make new characters.  My advice to new players is to not give up too fast because you feel overwhelmed. Take a few minutes to browse the forums or watch videos to learn about a build or how to play the game well. If you put in the time to learn about the game you will be glad you did and enjoy the game.   There may be desync issues which can be frustrating but they are being worked on and they are not as bad as people make them out to be. You can easily play the game with those small issues and be fine.  I am willing to help out new players with the game or questions they have about the game.

I just played the normal mode (where death is nothing more than a momentary hiccup) until the end of the story and didn't find any real problems.

If you liked Diablo 2 and other games like it, I don't think you will be dissapointed with this game, and since its free to play I don't see any reason why you shouldn't at least try it.   There is a permanent softcore league, permanent hardcore league. There is a 4 month softcore league, a 4 month hardcore league if you want ladder resets like in D2. And on top of that there are several race leagues daily if you want to compete on a very hardcore level.  You are very free in how you want to shape your character. The passive tree is gigantic and you can go anywhere you want on it. The only restriction to the class you choose is where you start on the passive tree. The builds are almost limitless, but if you want to do well in end-game you need to think about what you're doing.  This F2P game is actually F2P. There is no P2W or anything like that in this game. The shop consists of almost only cosmetic items. There is ONE thing in the shop that could 'help' you or at least make your time go a bit smoother, but again, it is not 'NEEDED' to play the game. The item I'm talking about is Stash tabs. Yes, you have an in-game stash much like in D2/D3. The stash consists of 4 tabs, but you can buy as many tabs as you want from the shop. So if you are a hoarder like me, you probably want to buy a lot of tabs.  The good thing though, is that the game is go good that I doubt you will think twice about buying some tabs and at the same time give them some support for making this awesome game. They are also expanding the game with content patches, new acts, new gems, items and what not on a regular basis.  Again, I can't recommend this game enough, I urge you to at least try the game out if you tend to like these kind of games. HF",

The multiplayer is okay, but PvE gets dull fast, as there is not enough variety to pose a challenge and the skills that are fun in singleplayer quickly turn into overpowered steamrollers in multiplayer. Bosses are are a little limited for a modern game, very few different stages and either the fight is over fast or gets protracted. The lenient respawn system alleviates frustration.

Building upon the skill tree action RPG (dice rolling behind the scenes) archetype set in stone by titles such as DIablo, Neverwinter Nights, Baulders Gate etc...The game does the time honored tradition well. The only concievable gripe would be the blistering lag and desynch issues and minor bugs. This is not so difficult with a reasonable internet connection.  The literature and surrounding world has been crafted excitingly, invoking much nostalgia of D2 classic and LOD Definitely doing an excellent job when it comes to the immersion into the world that has been created. Considering the amount of lore objects and voice acted bits you come across.  However many tricks pulled from the Diablo concept, this game is certainly a refreshing take. With no currency aside from crafting orbs, components, skill gems, and the subsequent support skill gems; any seasoned RPG nazi might find themselves completely immersed in building a series of characters.  The universal skill tree is sprawling, like dauntingly large at first. You seem to NEED to plan your toon ahead of time. Thankfully the stash is shared between characters on a server. So worst case scenario, breaking a character midgame isn't the end of the world. Merely running specific areas with enough rare item find capability allows you to administer a plethora of gear so as to build a new character.  Considering the recent introduction of the game, and couple of patches being released thus far; I imagine this title to go far.  Oh, and its free. Not like, work to level 20 before the game slows down and you need to buy your way to experience free *cough* SWTOR *cough* But free to play, not pay to win. Literally, you can enjoy the extent of the gaming experience without a dime going down the drain. Therefore, this is arguably the most enjoyable F2P title available. Thank you Steam/Valve/PC overlords for introducing this to me  (I still love Bioware and the Old Republic)  There is numerous series of 'season' events in which you register for a timed dungeon dive pitted in a race against other players. Each of these has specific parameters to set the environment and sometimes the difficulty for success. The most excitable (personally) is a hardcore open PVP ideal in whch other players may join your instance at will. Enabling you to butcher other individuals to further your chances at making it out on top, and helping yourself to their loot.  Based on your performance (levels gained, being the first to accomplish something(enter new area/complete quest) reaching certain levels marked in the parameters) you acquire points that accumulate towards a season total which allow you access to rewards (unique items that still have a percentage chance to drop in game) that appear in your stash.  All in all, worth the download. 7.5/10  But it's free, and what little issues exist can be rectified through further patching.......10/10 ",

You mess that up you gotta reroll another toon. Sure, you can grind out mats so you can respec ONE talent point, but you mess up any further have fun doing that.  The graphx are not cartoony and are realistic looking. Most if not all quests are completely voice overs so you won't have to worry about reading walls of text for quests (looking at you WoW). The last boss, Dominus, the man who has Exiled you to the slummed beaches is in no way a pushover. He has multiple phases and you will need to have built your character precisely with little to no screwups if you wish to take him down.  Build a character isn't as fun as say Torchlight or Diablo, but once you get that perfect build it shows and will bring a smile to your face. Those that have played Diablo in the past will feel right at home in this title. This is a game that shouldn't be overlooked and should be played. Oh, did I mention FREE!? 100% free and you'll never have or need to spend monies on it unless you want cosmetic stuff or feel the need to throw cash the developers way.   I'm pretty thorough and tend to study my character and go through all the loot that drops. I comleted this at lvl 40 and took me roughly (played during beta) 70 hours to beat. I did have to respec quite a few times though for my 'tank' build was awefully slow and had horrible dps, but once I found my sweet spot it was off to Dominus! Now, it's time for you to show Dominus how dominus you can be!",

The combat itself doesn't differ much from other examples in the genre, but Path of Exile distinguishes itself with a unique ability system based on gems and a labyrinthine passive skill system that permits the creation of almost any type of character. Leaderboards, PvP options, and lootable challenge maps spice up the higher level content, and an unusual bartering system staves off inflation in its multiplayer aspects. Best of all, it's free almost to a fault, revealing a compelling alternative path for free-to-play projects to come.",

I just wanted to write this review on steam so I could support the great game with another recommendation for people to play it. Don't let the complicated mechanics overwhelm you. Many of us feel that way when starting, but it's entirely possible to reverse engineer the mechanics and begin making your own builds. In fact, my most recent build was created entirely by me and is the strongest I've played so far.  If you are new, I recommend going on the forums and picking a build that seems like it would fit your playstyle. Once you get some items/currency/knowledge as a foundation, then you can begin experimenting with your own flavor of builds and playstyles. The more you do, the easier it becomes.  I also recommend the challenge/temporary leagues for new players because of the fresh economy. You will find better prices for gear there overall, and your characters/items/stash will all transfer to the permanent leagues when the temporary ones end. Eventually, you will understand how to start fresh in a new league with no items or characters, but you can still succeed.  TLDR: Play the game. Also, search the account 'reetismatic' on PoE forums to see how many characters I have made. My Prophecy league character is named Fair.",

My two payed for games haven't been touched because I can't get off poe.   -the dev support for this game is better than any other payed for game I've played.   -there is pay content. but it's beautifully integrated into the game. things like larger stash in game allows you to benefit in game while not getting an advantage over other players with money while supporting the devs. also there are cool graphical items you can buy to modify the looks of your portals, items, purchaseable pets, etc.   -they are constantly doing events and leagues to keep you entertained with something to participate in.   -Great trading market, solo play viable, group adventuring viable, community guilds, character development, I really could go on and on with positive things about this game but for the sake of not writing a book for a review I'll leave it at that.",

We all know how Diablo III turned out to be, so let's just leave it at that.  If you've ever played Diablo II in a serious fashion, you'll know what to expect from PoE. Throw in an incredibly large &amp; open Passive Skill Tree and Seasonal Races with some seriously skilled competition, and you'll have entertainment for hundreds of hours to come.  By and far the greatest aspect in PoE is the freedom of choice. Want to be a Summoner Marauder using a 2h sword? You can do it and be damn good to boot. Want to play a Melee Witch with copious amounts of Evasion? Go right ahead. Only the sky and your imagination is the limit. Since every class can get, and use, every skill and passive talent in the game, you can do virtually anything you want to with varying degrees of success.  Skills come in the form of gems. You stuff your Skill Gems to your items along with various kinds of Support Gems for different types of secondary effects on your skills. Combine that boring old Fireball of yours with Greater Multiple Projectiles and Mana Leech to fire six Fireballs at the same time and leech your enemy's mana while doing so! Great fun!   But wait, there's more!  Unique items, or Legendary items, add in a whole new level of depth to your character creation. These items will give you solid +stat boosts, the effects of certain passive talents, or increase the level/damage/quality of your gems, auras, status effects or specific skills.  Or maybe you'd like a Bow which prevents your arrows from doing physical damage, instead turning that damage to lightning? Yeah, got that and many more.  Your choices, however, aren't limited only to skills, unique items and passive talents; you can choose from different League Modes: Normal, Hardcore, Domination and Nemesis. The first two are self-explanatory, the latter two are temporary ladders which last only a certain amount of time (half a year or so, after which you'll get different ladders), and have additional gear, monster affixes, permanent death, in-world items (such as shrines) etc. for increased variety, challenge and better economy.  Speaking of economy, the game doesn't have any set type of currency such as gold. You'll have to manually trade your items for different items with other people. No Auction Houses like Diablo III had or any such nonsense. Trading is brutal and if you're not familiar with the economy, you'll get cheated on and end up poor as a beggar. This is especially true for the hardcore D2JSP people with years of experience in D2 trading; they'll tear you limb-to-limb and you won't even realise it.  Patience and learning from your past mistakes is absolutely mandatory if you want to master the magical continent of Wraeclast. If you're used to playing RPGs on Easy or Medium difficulty, hate constant grinds for a few lousy pieces of gear, and loathe getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you on a plate: try another game.  Path of Exile is not for the faint of heart.",

In any case, it just means this thing hasn't even been tracking all of my time spent enjoying this game.  It's years old, but still going strong and steadily expanding.  The developers keep making improvements to the game's content and the engine itself. Every 3 months there are new 3 month long 'leagues' which are separated from the permanent main game and offer everyone a fresh even start with a new economy which is an incredibly well working concept. Each league adds some new mechanics, skills or a twist on how the game works in general to always keep it fresh and fun and with unique challenges and rewards to boot. Additionally every 6 months (thereabout) we get a huge expansion to the game which is adding a lot of fresh new content to the game in often very unexpected and genre-innovating forms.  As a free to play game I have to say this: It is definitely the most 'free2play done right' game I can think of.  There are no cash borders on any content of the game, you can play and participate in absolutely everything and even the huge expansions are added for free to everyone. Everything in the cash store are optional outfits, visual effects or various non-combat companions (which serve no other function, but to look cool).  With the exception of one convenience item that is really only going to be needed if you want to spend a long time playing this game, in which case you really should throw at least a dollar at the devs! And that item is stash storage. Each player is given 4 big stashes for free, but if you want to hoard absolutely everything, you can do so buy purchasing more stash tabs. Every other week they also seem to run a sale on these so it's not even that bad if you wanted to purchase some. That said, you always have 4 free stash tabs for a new league as well and when the league ends they will move all these stashes and add them to your permanent game ones, so you won't ever lose anything and don't need to purchase extra space if you just want to store everything for eternity. Super generous and would basically allow you to play free forever and never lose anything.  I don't even want to get into the content too much because it's more fun to explore and engage yourself - there is an immense amount of knowledge to buildup if you want to understand and theorycraft everything that's going on in this. But for me - it is a literal THEORYCRAFTING HEAVEN. And I love every bit of it. Literally countless combinations of characters and ability combinations are possible. And this is really it's strongest point - mix and matching steadinly increasing amounts of skills and enjoying the outcome and seeing how far you can take it.  Due to having lots of different base skills (ranging from melee attacks, bow attacks, traps, remote attack summons or various necromantic activities) combined with lots of skill altering effects (such as increasing the amount of projectiles fired, forking them, adding explosions or various damage types, causing other skills to chain activate off of them , lots of unique items altering even more basic mechanic and skill effects AND SO ON.  Creativity knows no bounds in path of exile.  I know I'll be following this to the end and will enjoy every moment of it. And I hope somebody else reading this will too!",

Right now is a great time to try by the way if you're reading this around when I wrote it, breach is a really fun league and a lot of solid items are as cheap as they've ever been.   If you decide to take the plunge here are some words of advice to make the awful new player game experience less terrible for you:   1: A lot of people will tell you to wing it with the already imposing skill tree on your first character, those people are morons. Find a build on the PoE forums that says something like new player friendly or cheap, having some sense of direction is great, and getting to level 40 to find out you've bricked a character really isn't, it's frustrating as hell.   2: In some respects the devs are pretty dumb and irresponsible. Trade, which is essentially vital to the game is handled entirely through a third party site called poe.trade. Trade chat is a waste of your time 90% of time.   3: If you make it to like level 60, look up something called the chaos vendor recipe, it will take up a fair amount of your quite limited stash space, but it will fund your poe trade buys for cheap stuff, selling is a lot more of a pain without buying stash tabs but it is possible, if you make it this far it could be worth looking up.   4: Feel free to try something a bit weird once you've had a feel for the game. One of the reasons why I like PoE is that it's one of very very few games that let minion builds be really powerful. There are even strange builds that deal all their damage by letting enemies hit them and then triggering a bunch of counterspells. Chances are there's something unique that's just up your alley. Have fun out there.",

If you like Action RPGs and haven't tried PoE, not only is it a great game but it is free. Also it is not Pay to Win by any means, all purchasable items are cosmetic or stash related. I spent my founders coins (can't recall what they are called) on more stash space and customizing of said space but outside of about $15 I haven't spent anywhere near the amount of what this game is worth. I do wish that there was a way to pay a set amount for an offline mode as I solo mostly but for a free to play game I am not going to knock the online only part.",

            "review_text": "You know what's missing in these reviews? A 'not sure' button. That's what I need right now. I can't entirely recommend the game, but it's not a bad game either anyway, so I'm torn.  Things that I liked:  - Atmosphere and graphics are really nice. It's honestly the most atmospheric isometric RPG I've come across. The landscape is dark and brutal, the enemies more or less believable. From the looks to the sound, everything is pretty nice.  - Voice acting is pretty good, at times even superb.   Things I find controversial:  - The skill system is definitely interesting. Your gear has sockets that can be outfitted with gems. They come in different colors and can of course only be matched. Red generally is strength, blue is magic, green is dexterity and yellow I have not encountered any gems yet. This has advantages and disadvantages. For example my warrior can throw fireballs or send frosty shockwaves out (very handy at least in the early game, because enemies hit relatively hard). The more you use a skill the sooner you can upgrade it. Here's the issue however...I can no longer upgrade my frosty shockwave, because I lack the intellect to do so. Well, I'm a warrior. Chances are my intellect will not rise quickly enough to keep this skill relevant throughout the game. I'm not sure there's int on gear. AFIK you can 'skill' int, but that's also locked to very late in the game I think. Also, a rune usually only works with certain weapon types equipped, so if I find, say, a really good sword, but my mighty rune only works with a mace, then I'm out of luck. I then have to choose between the weapon and my skill (cleave for example). Frankly, this is annoying, and it's putting a lot of unnecessary thinking into the game imho. It also gives you flexibility, that's true, but levelling skills all over again must be frustrating...ever more so the higher your own level is.  - The combat system in general. It lacks 'oomph'. More often than not I'm not sure if my swings even connect or whatever, because in this game you can miss and you will miss and it's going to annoy you. Of course it's only fair that you can miss. All in all the combat feels a bit lackluster.  - It's free (to play). So far I can only see cosmetic stuff in the store like different pets and effects for weapons and so on.  - The story in general is 'ok'. You're exiled. Well, one would think you're just like the others, but of course once again, everyone relies on you for survival. It would have been nice if the other exiles at least fought for themselves. Once again you're the hero. You've just been exiled and you're struggling to survive, but please kill 100000 monsters, so we can relocate our settlement. Come on.  - There is no real economy in the game. Meaning you simply seem to be trading your gear for scrolls and stuff to identify gear and potentially buy other gear. It feels incredibly unrewarding, but of course it makes sense in the setting. What need is there for a currency when you're exiled to a dangerous island? Yet still it feels unrewarding not to collect gold. Not sure if this is the best system for an arpg.   Things I did not like:  - The minimap or overlay map is garbage imho. The color and visibility are lacking.  - The skill 'tree'. Basically you choose your class at the beginning, but that actually doesn't matter one bit (there's certain gear that you can't wear, because you lack the necessary stats) and that determines where in the incredibly huge skill tree you start off...sounds interesting? It isn't. At all. There are hundreds of skills to learn, but they are exclusively passive skills. The skill tree is excessively large, but largely boring. So far I have exclusively invested points into more strength and hps and some regeneration. That's it and that's what it's going to be for the rest of the game. What choice is there really? It's incredibly boring. Levelling up doesn't even excite me and I'm just level 6 or so, because I look at that tree and I think to myself...yay another stat point increase 0o. Wow. Maybe there are some interesting talents in there? I didn't find any and I looked around quite a bit...Why is it even in there? What customization does it offer? Everything in there is simply a stat increase.  - Always online. Yes, this is a multiplayer game, even if you don't want to play with others. You have to choose a server, pick a name, that is not taken, and jump into the world. Seriously. That's annoying. Granted you only see other players in PVP arenas and hub zones I think. The latter include a blackboard where you can join groups and do 'stuff'. I have no idea, cuz I'm a noob in this game, but the idea is cool. Now, if the game was offline and I could connect to the server via that blackboard and find a group? That would be cool. An optional feature, but not being able to choose the name I want for my characters? Not cool. It reminds me too much of an MMO. I think in D3, which is also an online game, you can choose whatever name you want for your character, because you group with others via your battle net tag. You also create an acount for PoE, so why not use that one and let me ♥♥♥♥ing name my characters the way I want to? Annoying. It's also causing lag I think. At least it feels like it.   I think that's all I can say for now, so why a 'yes' if there is only really 1 or 2 good things on my list? It's free. That is the only reason why I can really recommend the game. Potentially it's really great in the end game, but Idgaf. If a game doesn't hook me early on I don't really need to continue. I will probably play a bit more of it...but I doubt I'll ever make it to max level or even through the story...we'll see. Going to be a long time definitely. It's got potential, but it's not really 100% for me I think. The demographic might be shameless min maxers who like to dwell on the optimal builds forever? I dunno.

CONS:  The difficulty level - early content is pretty easy, but it does get harder as you progress. End game content is unforgiving, even to the best players. However, this can also be a pro. The more challenging the content, the more it pushes you to excell as a player. Beating end game content becomes that much more rewarding.   Creating builds - Most people dont know when they start this game for the first time how much they need to focus on defense when creating a build. Also, many of the game's mechanics have complex interactions, and there are detailed differences in how certain words in the description effect certain mechanics (see 'increased' vs 'more') This knowledge comes with experience. Everyone's first build is always a huge failure. But, a little research and a little experience go a long way.

To adress the elephant in the room at the time of this review the microtransaction shop is not in any way gamebreaking, beeing fully there for cosmetic stuff and not game enhancing capabilities, unless you count a a shared guild stash.  DISCLAMER: Be ready for a long review and while i've tried to be objective there is no such thing my experience beeing coloured by games of the past. There's also a TL;DR down at the bottom of the review for those who want a synopsis.  To start off the review I have to draw a comparison to Diablo, the grandaddy of Hack n Slash RPG's.. This game mostly resembles Diablo 2 both in it's atmosphere and in it's approach to dungeon design, combat and loot drop. This can work both to the game's advantage and disadvantage, as most new players might prefer the breakneck pace of Diablo 3 combat, the straight forward loot progression and simplicity of level design in newer games. For me the only thing that could be improved upon, from the above would be the combat, adding some of the fluidity that comes with newer games. But enough with the similarities, here's what's different, and what might put off some people while drawing in some others: Leveling up in PoE will get you get a few points to spend in specific atributes, the difference comes in the form of skills and the passive skill tree.  Skills unlike in other games, are not inherent to your chosen class, they are found in the world through quests or loot drops in the form of gems. Gems have to be equipped in specific coloured sockets in the armor you are wearing, making the loot system that much deep and rewarding, but we'll get back to that a bit later.  Skills level up and gain XP, as your character, while you have them equipped. You have the option of leveling them up, to get a more powerful version of that skill, or not, for with great power... comes great manacost..! Skills can also be augmented and improved by other passive skill gems to add extra elemental damage, bounce, last longer etc.. whatever you can think of you can probably enhance, to the detriment of your mana cost. The passive skill tree is a giant web of intricate design, that min/max players will have a blast figuring out, while casual players might get a headache from, it allows to forge your character into specific roles, or enhance certain skills to act differently or become highly potent. The skill tree is shared between all classes, but the starting point in it is different; both a downside and an upside to this is that the skilltree will be familiar to players building new characters to try out different classes, and this also might bore some calling the game out for it's lack of diversity. Enough about the skills! Let's talk LOOT! ..or not? The loot in the game provides different values other than the highest number on the item. Everything in this game revolves around the skills and skillgems, the loot plays an integral part in it. A good item might be one with high stats and a couple gem sockets, a great item might have half the stats of the other one, be of common rarity and by having 6 gem sockets. Sockets and skillgems are of 3 different colours, red, green, blue. As you can imagine the socket and the gem must match, but what makes the system even more complex is the fact that you can improve a green skill with a blue and a red or whichever mix of the 3 you'd like or no mixing and just one color.  This is done by links between sockets in your item and possesing the right enhancement gems. As you can imagine your item might have 6 sockets, and none linked, or just 2 linked. You'd think but what are the odds of getting that kind of loot? Well there's a solution for that.. and no it's not microtransactions.",

A complex Affixes/Suffixes system of item combinations makes it what people expected from Diablo 3: Being able to select what item I want to wear no matter is the primary stat of the class. Path of Exile also contains a HUGE Passive Node Skill Tree which contains somewhere around 1300 nodes which are accessible for each class because all classes use the same Passive Node Skill Tree. 100 levels, 3 difficulties, 3 acts (as for now), tons of mobs, vendor recipes and a different kind of currency that you will NOT find in other games.

            "review_text": "This is my absolute favorite ARPG to play. I loved Diablo 2. This game is a much more complex, hard, rewarding, exciting and unique Diablo 2 / Titan Quest ARPG. The RNG is real, the challanges are fun. The content doesn't get dull. Progression is limitless. Knowledge is never ending. Mechanics are so well done. The skills in this game are interesting. The ability to MAKE ANY BUILD you want is just simply the greatest.    My cons: Poor optimization, an SSD and good processor/video card/memory is required to play at a stable FPS.  The highest of tier content, maps, at certain point become very hard to aquire and sustain without a mapping group. It's doable but likely expensive for solo players. Not so much of a big deal if you really want to work towrds it.  There is still slight desynch in this game, but with the new Lockstep, the rubberbanding does not happen for the most part. The lag is very small when it does happen, it isn't gamebreaking unless you have a bad PC.  Overall, if you've never played an APRG like this before, it make come off as too hard. The hardest / least fun part of this game is first starting out and realizing you don't know what you're doing, and content is becoming harder and you have no idea what skills to use, what passives to take, what armor and weapons to use. What items to pick up to sell, what items are bad, what items are extremely rare. All of this stuff simply takes TIME to understand. I've played this game since closed beta, on and off. I learn somethng new all the time and people are still finding things out.  This game is good for casuals for the leagues that are never wiped. This game is good for semi-compeitive people who like to have fresh starts / new economy with new leagues. This game is SUPER competitive if you want to reach the top of the ladder or if you want to become a good racer. Racing is awhole nother part of the game that adds an interesting break from the typical game play.  The content updates are constant, the gaming company, Grinding Gear Games are simply the best of the best. On par with Valve and sorta kinda Blizzard-8-years-ago. There are bugs, there are issues, there is stuff that can be annoying or simply out dated (tetris inventory managment for example) but they are few and far and don't axe the game.  If you want to pick up this game and just mindlessly play-- you can. But you will reach a point in the game where you'll aboslutely need to gear properly and link your skill gems and get good flasks. This is always the biggest issue I see with new players. This is a game that rewards you for doing research, watching streams and videos and simply trail and error.  Don't expect this to play like an arcade game, similar to Diablo 3. It isn't noob friendly, but it isn't anti-noob. Make friends in this game, add people if you liked grouping with them, most people are friendly and are always welcoming to newplayers to help out.  If you're my friend, hit me up, I will do everything I can to make you realize this game. It's fun, I love it. Oh and it's 100% free to play. There is no pay to win. Extra stash tabs don't make you rich, knowing how to use them does. That said, they do give a big benefit to people who buy the, but there isn't a single person who cannot do what 100 stash player can compared to a f2p 4 stash tab. But it does make life easier.",

Personally loved the Diablo feel and it helped chill out during small breaks. Haven't played co-op yet nor I have checked the whole experience the game has to offer. Not many people seem to know about this game either. But for a F2P it looks awesome enough not to give you serious reasons to pay for anything.

Let me cut to the chase and say it is exactly like Diablo 3 - it totally rips off Diablo 3, from some aspects of the GUI to the gameplay style. However, this is the best ripoff of Diablo 3 in the world. It's an awesome game, and I reccommend you play it. I was going to purchase Diablo 3, but Path of Exile fills my Diablo-style game needs. It's a truly awesome game, and the co-op makes it even better. I have some buddies that I play it with, and it's loads of fun.  However, comparing this to Diablo isn't that good of a review. Let me speak about how the game actually is. It's a hack and slash game where you collect loads of loot to make your character stronger. It's basically got the movement and camera angle of most MOBAs (top down, click to move your character), with MMO gameplay. It's not hard to get into, and it's satisfying and fun. Sure, you can grind, but in the early stages of the game, it's just pure fun - you don't feel like, 'Ugh, I have to grind FOREVER to get better armor because I'm too underpowered for this mission.' Sure, there may be some spots like that in the game, but the grinding is FUN! Just going around The Coast in the first act is fun in itself - you fight off endless hordes of the undead. So, if you have to grind, it's not boring grinding - it's fun.   For any MMO lovers (whether you like WoW, Diablo, etc.), I suggest you pick up this free-to-play game. If this game costed money, I would buy it. Now, if they slapped a price tag on it now in it's current state, I would not. They'd have to nerf the microtransactions, and make it a little more worth paying for. But, if they did a little more work on it and polished it enough to make people pay money (a one time fee, not a subscription model), then, yeah, I'd probably buy it.   I fully reccomend this game for anybody who wants something new to play either solo, or with their buddies. It can probably run on a potato if you lower the graphics settings all the way, so if your computer isn't exactly what you'd call powerful, this gem should run just fine and dandy. It only needs a 1.4GHz processor and an Nvidia GeForce 7800GT. I have a computer that's about ten years old that could probably run this game pretty nice at low-medium settings.

Different monsters in every area keeps the game exciting and very fun. I'm not really a big fan of ARPG or RPG games, but games like PoE and Dust: an Elysian Tale have really made me a fan of the genre. If you don't want to get PoE because you aren't interested in RPG games, then you shouldn't be. The game is free, as you prbably already know, and there's no cons about getting the game. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a good game to play. Also invite your friends to play. PoE is a good game when playing solo. But even better when you have another person to help you on quests. The quests are not very hard on normal, especially if you have someone to help you. Overall, PoE is a game that never seems to disappoint. It in fact does not get boring as some games might eventually grow to be. I would get PoE, because there's nothing to lose, and it is an excellent game.",

But PoE is that much BETTER.  Free-To-Play? It's a irritating and negative word isn't it? that is filled with hidden lies. PoE uses a mechanic that is much like Dota2- a true F2P model. And i give it my vote. All f2p transactions in PoE is optional, there's no advantage to using real money, as all monetary assets in this game are cosmetic and not nessassary; other items allow user to expand upon guild inventory .etc In short, if you use money in the game, it will not matter when you play PvE or PvP.  Replay Value, Leagues and ladders Path of Exile is a brilliant game with high traffic in activities that gets released often by the devs- keeping the game interesting. Ladders and PvP keep the competitive users busy, while PvE and Farming-Users get a whole bunch of challenges that keep farming easy and efficient.

As an exile you travel through the world to kill those who did this to you. But enough about the story, it's an action RPG, you're here to kill hard bosses and have fun destroying packs of minor mobs, and i can tell you, you will. it is not a Pay2Win game, you can get to end game without paying a penny. Up to 6 people partys allow you to have a good game playing with your friends. game has no gold, but it has 18 types of items upgrading your equipment that work as one complex monetary system. Incredibly big passive skill tree, it might look like a mess at the first glance but later on you'll realise that it's really in-depth. It also has a diffrent approach on your active abilities, rather than getting 1 active skill point you get skill gems that you put in your equipment, every skill can also be modified to deal greater damage or hit more enemies and auras reserve your mana in exchange of giving you a benefit. I should also add that the Community is one of the best i've ever seen and developers are good at what they're doing. The game has obviously it's problems. like Desynchronisation with the server that can cause your death, so if you'll ever feel laggy type /oos in chat, it's a temproary help. loading times are bad, like REALLY BAD, and some areas like lagging more than they should, if you have a bad PC and you see a strongbox with a mod 'Guarded by a Rouge Exile' don't open it, it will freeze your screen for several seconds and kill you.  Pros  +Free to Play but not P2W +Fun mechanics +Community +Alot of possible builds due to an ENORMOUS passive point tree +Alot of replay value +Creative active skill mechanics +Good idea of Economy in game +High quality graphics +Devs working with Community to improve the game  Cons  -DESYNC -Loading Screens take alot of time -Some areas like to lag the game a bit  Overall Opinion  Game is good, very good but not perfect. Pros outweigh Cons by quite alot but 2 of 3 cons are major, and need to be fixed ASAP. overall expirience with the game is good and brings memories of Diablo 2 LoD in gameplay.

Any piece of gear can be modified and changed into something useful by using common consumables you pick up, so you never really run into a loot 'dry spell' that prevents you from continuing onwards with the build you are trying to do. Skills granted by gems that are placed into sockets on items, so any 'character class' can use almost any skill as long as they have the stat requirements for it: if you want your rogue-like character to be able to use corpse explosion, he can. Skill gems can also be modified by support gems if you equip them to a piece of gear with connected sockets, so you can make your Corpse Explosion cause enemies to Flee or restore Health when you use it, etc..  Zones are highly randomized with layouts and monsters which keeps the game from getting stale each time you play it or start a new character. Lastly, the developers run timed 'leagues' frequently which encourage you to keep rolling new characters and trying new things to participate. PoE takes some huge steps forward for the genre, and is a far better game than other recent ARPGs like Diablo 3 or Torchlight 2. It's also free. What do you have to lose?",

Another thing I disliked is how there is no quest marker and how you have to explore the map to find a certain area that it doesn't tell you to go into to complete the quest system. This game is best played with friends. The loot system was good, choose what you want to pick up rather then picked everything up. For movement you had to left click to move. You use 1;2;3;4;5 for your potions and Left Click;Middle Click;Right Click; Q;W;A;S;D for your attacks. This game is based around a keyboard and mouse and it not compatible with a controller.

Read the guides in the community page, watch youtube things. Those gamers know their stuff. * As stated elsewhere... this truly is a free game. You can buy quality of life improvements, but unless you're gonna sink significant time in to the game, you certainly don't need to.... and I suspect tossing the devs some money once you've put 50 + hours in probably won't be such a big deal.  I recommend this game on the off chance that it's just the sort of thing you're looking for. It kind of wasn't for me. I didn't really resonate with the storyline or the characters and while I thought many of the systems (particularly the much talked about leveling and class customization system) were fantastic.... I was unwilling to put in the amount of energy to parse it all out. I sort of think of it as the EVE:Online version of DIABLO.... the potential rewards are just about as vast as the potential work you'll need to get them.  ",

Combat is like Diablo 3, but passive skills are done like the node map from FF10 and active skills are treated like materia in FF7. Combine this together and you can make any kind of character you want. The passive node map starts you out near skills that are typically desired for the character class you choose, but if you want to make a 2h sword wielding, minion summoning Shadow (aka rogue) you are more than capable of it.   Combat starts out slow, it takes a couple hours before you have the skills to do a lot, but when you do the game is incredibly enjoyable. Monsters are a nice mix, some of them being able to use the same skills you can find. The maps are randomly generated for the most part, with the maps generally resetting after about 8-15 minutes of you not being on it anymore.   There is no currency in the game. All trading, whether through NPCs or with other players is through a barter system. This makes trading interesting, with rarer stackable items being more highly prized as currency.   Music is nice and sets the feel of the game. There is voice acting, and it is very good, better than I've heard in quite a few AAA games actually.   Now the important part, the cash shop. This is a F2P game so obviously there is a cash shop of some kind... thankfully the developers did not make the game pay-to-win. The cash shop offers cosmetic changes and more tabs for your shared stash and that's it. No gear, nothing that changes gameplay, nothing that will effect how you actually play the game at all. You can change the visual effect of certain things/skills, apply skins to items you use, all just pretties that do nothing exept make you look fancy, as it should be.   The developers said in a review that they wanted to make a game that they would want to play, and it shows. Amazingly fun, incredibly customizable, and the first time you get get a rare, unique, or skill drop you are going to go 'squeeee!!!!'.",

After five depressing years, the desynch is mostly gone, and you can now choose between their broken prediction code or the framerate tanking lockstep code. Don't live close to a server? Too bad! The game is still online-only, horribly unoptimized, and more antagonistic than ever.  There is literally nothing 'hardcore' about this game. Absolutely everything you do is strictly controlled by an unyielding procedural hate engine, made to trickle-feed its top 0.2% players the unfeasibly rare unique items required for endgame progression. It's ridiculous how antagonistic this is to the normal player, who might not want to concern themselves with the economy, like myself. The gameplay is far too shallow to have an item-based economy jammed into its face. It's literally an incubator for bots to thrive in, feeding off those unfortunate enough to become slaves to the Skinner Box.  The lore and setting is cool, though it kind of gets dumb after act 3.  -----ORIGINAL POST----- I have never played a game with such horrible netcode and antagonistic design. It's like using Onlive where you download the entire game, but must continue to suffer through horrible network structure. What makes this even better is that the game isn't remotely balanced for this abysmal system. Spike damage, fast mobs, desynchronizing abilities (come to think of it, everything will desynch you), horrible melee system (% block chance? Really?), woefully imbalanced unique items you will only ever see on the forums or on botted accounts in trade chat, and a whole garbage pit of other potentially fantastic mechanics completely ruined by something so fundamentally broken.  What were the developers thinking? No self respecting game would be caught dead with so many anti-player systems in place, free to play or not. Grinding Gear Games even stated that the 'economy' is the most important aspect of the game. What fool would place the importance of a theoretical market over the gameplay that economy supposedly thrives from? It makes no sense! Since the gameplay is so shallow, bots have pretty much 'free' reign over the trading portion of the game, seeing as drop rates on anything are total garbage.  I will, however, recommend playing through the game once or twice through Normal difficulty, alone. No New Game+ (Cruel) or New Game++ (Merciless). The lore and the general experience is worth that much, but do not, and I repeat with caps, DO NOT give Grinding Gear Games a single (insert smallest denomenation of currency here) of your money. Doing so will not fix the netcode any faster, since they've had over half a decade to do so.",

I played Diablo II and Titan Quest so much that I can never look at those games again without throwing up, so I guess I sort of dig action RPG stuff.   Anyway, give it a shot if you love ARPG's. There's a ton of story to go through (though, to be honest, I don't think I paid attention to any of it because story = eats into my looting time). After, there are 'maps' which are like instanced dungeons that are kinda sorta a little possibly somewhat like 'raids' or other group dungeons in other games.

Its basically a slightly different take at Diablo with the same core gameplay as Diablo 2, there is innovation; but it is in areas which needed it the most and are very outdated in Diablo 2 by now; those of simply put functionality - the simplest example is a shared stash among all your characters and you can buy more tabs on it, as many as you like more or less - this replaces the tiresome muling in D2 very well.  Community is relatively alive.  I am not a fan of the setting in general. There sort of are multiple settings, but they vary little. Act 1 is basically New Zealand; act 2 is kind of a wannabe jungle and A3 is ancient rome. Overall the atmosphere with its music and weather effects is rather bland compared to Diablo 2 which with its epic music and varying, epic settings and good weather effects was at times pretty awesome. Although I must say even Diablo 2 was not super atmospheric simply because it was an action ARPG, so it is understandable that atmosphere was not highly emphasized in PoE.  Overall gameplay is a bit boring. I wish there had been more innovation in the core gameplay as well. Though it will probably satisfy a diehard D2 fan.  After many many months of being well out of Beta, content variation such as monsters is still poor; it was much better in Diablo 2.  Theres also the issue of drop rarity. Many people who play alot have only found 5-10 Exalted orbs, while owning much much more in general wealth. It begs the question where do all the Exalts people have or use even come from? Finding exalts and such is therefore not satisfying even when it happens sadly because they arent even worth that much.  As far as I know there are no effective cheats such as dupes; I would consider this as part of innovation in functionality again.  There is great desync - and this is the real killer for me - I do not even imagine how hardcore players play. For softcore players death is also a big loss - exp is valuable, very valuable especially when you are doing maps - which is one of the late game activities in the game. There, exp is the main value of doing maps anyway, and when a part of the game thats not supposed to be there interferes and possibly makes you lose alot of the exp you have worked hard to get (trying to avoid death while kiling monsters) during doing nearly the whole map then this can be extremely frustrating. Desync adds an element to the game that you are not only fighting the monsters, but also the desync and this is tiring. Its not fun.  Character building and theorycrafting can be alot of fun and there are many, many options - more than in Diablo 2.  However, weaponry is limited - there are no javelins or spears, for example.  Overall I would not recommend this game unless you really love Diablo 2.",

I am using a GTX 970 and run the game from an SSD, the game simply does not run well. Ground effects in particular are liable to drop your frames significantly.  What is most vexing to me is that GGG (the developers behind this game) have had raving success with Path of Exile, yet publicly admit that they have just one single employee working on optimization. Clearly his work alone is insufficient to combat the performance issues inherent in each new content pack. Does GGG not see this as a glaring issue within their game?

I just beat it on normal difficulty (and like D2 there are still Nightmare and Hell modes to go) which took me 18 hours for the 3 Acts the game offers. Unlike D2's skill / mastery tree PoE's active skills are all from gems slotted into your items. Your gems/skills level up as you gain XP with them slotted in. There's also a passive skill tree that is like D2's tree (actually, it reminds me of FFX's sphere grid mostly). The system works pretty well in my opinion thanks to the customization offered by support gems (skill gems that modify other skill gems) and you find yourself considering whether an item is worth swapping for another item given the number of slots, links, and colour of the slots. There's a lot of nuance and different builds and optimization to look after. It's the same wonderful time-sink that Diablo 2 was.  The most notable downside is that I've seen some desyncing problems. Occasionally a mob will aggro on me, I'll hit it but not actually do damage and then a few seconds later the mob will teleport to its actual position. I've also had some problems where I'm running through a group of mobs and run past them, but the server-side code decides I actually got hit and stunned and teleports me back to the middle of the group. This happens quite a bit actually and is very noticeable.  Overall a fun game. Even if you aren't going to sink your life into this Diablo 2 work-alike you'll get ~20 hours of enjoyable gameplay for the low, low cost of free.",

I believe that a few of the developers of Diablo split off and helped make this game, specifically the good devs. I actually kinda wished the game cost money because I then could've felt as if I NEEDED to play it. The F2P aspect gives me the idea of, 'Well there's always later.' Getting past that. VERY WELL DONE. Sound, reminiscent of that in Diablo 2 (coin dropping noises, gems, swords dropping, etc...). Combat, very compact and once again, reminiscent of that in Diablo 2. Now, the kicker, COMPLETELY CUSTOM SKILL TREE. Wow. What a smart idea guys. It's not hard to come up with, but it works SO much better in this game. Music as well, never even noticed. The way it was supposed to be, it immersed me.  I recommend any former D1 or D2 player to check this out over anything you can imagine in D3. Even if you didn't play the Diablos, but you like MOBAs and RPGs, this is a very good pick for you.  p.s. Graphics are a major step-up compared to D2.",

I went to the reviews section and I was shocked at the absolute positive reviews that this game was getting. Then I played it... And to be honest, I don't understand what all the fuss is about, it's not that fun of a game. Well, more like it was hyped way too much, and people in the comments made it sound like I was going to ♥♥♥♥♥♥ while playing this game. However, for a free game it honestly wasn't too bad. This game is a good time waster, although it's long and tedious gameplay, you will probably spend hours on it anyway. There's something about this game that seems fun, and I can see a lot of potential in it. I don't like the currency system however, going back to old school trading and it's a little unfair from my view. But that's just my opinion, but even so it kind of feels like there's no point without coins...   However, I do recommend this game. Because it shouldn't be free. For a free game, this was outstanding! There was time and work put into it, it's not a pay to win system, it's unique in it's own little ways, but it doesn't have a very good story. Hence 'RPG' if you want a good story from this game, you're gonna have to make one up in your head because the story line is boring. The npcs show almost no emotion, the voice acting isn't good and for a game like this, the voices should be left in our head. I like to imagine what they sound like instead of having dissapointment at the dreadful sounding characters who show nothing more but quest titles. Even so, great game and I do recommend. So, here's my summary:  Pros: * Free * Not a pay to win system * Time waster  Cons: * Currency system * Voice actors * Bad story line  I know I'm gonna get a lot of hate for this comment, but this is just my opinion.",

You acquire skills via gems that function identically to the Materia system in Final Fantasy 7. You equip gems to enable skills, and can equip support gems to modify those skills to your liking. The combinations are endless.  Character development is done through a gigantic passive skill tree that can be a bit overwhelming at first. Your first couple tries might not be very good, but once you understand the game and what you need it will be much easier to use. It greatly resembles the Sphere Grid of Final Fantasy 10.   The game can be played in Single Player virtually the whole time, but multi-player is preferable at later levels. Trading is a necessary part of the game later on, however it is very clunky and sometimes quite painful.   By far the best aspect of the game is that it is NOT pay to win, you can purchase convenient upgrades for your inventory or aesthetic effects, but by no means will putting money in help you advance through the world. The game increases in diffculty greatly in the 3rd difficulty level and will challenge even the msot experienced players of ARPGs.   There is a story but it's not really required to understand the game, I've never bothered to look into it. Quests are abundant, although rewards could be a bit better at times.   It's free, almost to a fault. This is a game you SHOULD pay $40 for. 200+ hours and 4 different builds later and I'm still enjoying the experience.   8/10: The trade interface (or lack thereof) and other minor quality of life features that are missing keep this score from being higher, but the core experience is absolutely delightful.",

The best selling micro-transactions are either more stash slots or cosmetics. Everything else can be acquired in-game and for free.  The setting and theme are done well, borrowing from both fantasy and horror alike and providing an interesting enough mixture of the two in the game world, enemies, classes, items, weapons, and spells. The voice acting is good, and the ambient sounds, music, and sound effects are also all of good quality. The gameplay is what you can come to expect from a very standard action RPG, with the only innovation being in the form of spells and how their mechanic is employed. People seem to often be in awe of the passive skill tree, but it really is very straightforward and not too different from other similar games. Possible class builds and paths have something for everyone's play style.  Loot is one of the main focuses of the game, and this is also a big disappointment for me. The loot in Path of Exile is simply not very good. There is very little variety between what you find and what is actually useful. There just doesn't seem to be enough loot for a game of this scope, where multiple playthroughs are almost expected for the sake of it's longevity. I personally can't imagine what someone would find enjoyable and redeeming in a second, third, or more playthroughs of Path of Exile. There just isn't enough variety in anything. The loot is not interesting at all, sadly.  My favorite aspect of Path of Exile is the naming of items and enemies. The developers did a great job in coming up with many of those titles. To conclude, since this game is totally free to experience in all of its entirety, for as long as you're willing to keep going, it's worth a try. If you're a fan of the genre, you'll at least enjoy your first playthrough.  Path of Exile is good.",

            "review_text": "This game has a lot of interesting things going for it, but also a lot of problems too.  First, while it hypothetically has 'millions of combinations' like most games with this sort of customization, there's 'what you can do' and 'what actually works' which is usually 5-10 specific builds built to just clear endgame over and over.   The game is somewhat interesting, interesting world, interesting lore (if you can be bothered to read it in the hundreds of times you'll see the same lines over and over).   As a FTP diablo clone, it's not horrible, but very quickly you realize that optimal clear speed is the only thing that actually matters in the game, unless you're trying to farm 1 specific endgame boss (which there are not many of). There are 'tons of unique items' but probably 80% of them are just jung to toss away the moment you get.  Even leveling is incredibly boring, similar to Borderlands, you just play through story mode 3x, then get to endgame content, except 90% of endgame is just grinding more, and there's much less story to enjoy, even if you don't have to listen to claptrap.  It also doesn't help the game runs like crap on every computer/system I try it on, my computer is capable of running VR flawlessly, and still many zones in POE only run at 20-30fps. I've been trying for a few months to fix it with no success.  There are some cool things here, like the breach league 'open portals where enemies can stream in' except all this does is provide a condensed meat grinder to reinforce the clear speed meta. It wouldn't be so bad if you needed a different strategy to clear bosses, but 99% of the aoe skills in the game are stronger than the single target/melee counterparts, so there's honestly almost no purpose at all to not go aoe clear. And once you realize that, you realize that 'if i'm going to go aoe clear, i might as well just build the most efficient one' which is pretty much the same as everyone else.   There's the atlas... which was kind of cool, except the supposed '100 unique maps' are more like 30-40 with many assets and even whole areas completely re used and called something different. all this does is make the endgame grind more annoying as you just have to hope to rng that you get a better map so you can get closer to the bosses of the maps.   i could go on... for a long time. In my opinion, this game has a lot of cool ideas, but has implemented most of them very poorly.   If you like diablo and just want a F2P game that's kinda the same, but much harder, give POE a try, but I don't recommend sinking as much time into it as other games.",

Music is alright but somehow the atmosphere does not really come up at most places. A lot of places feel the same and very generic. Others are really well made, but those are the minority. Too much repetition in enemies (some are just coloured differently and given a new name..)  -- desynchronisation issues make the game feel 'detached', what you see on your screen does not correspond to what happens in the gameplay and other issues arise such as sudden teleports leading to deaths etc. This issue has been around since beta and has only gotten worse since then. EDIT: They added lockstep now which shows you what actually happens on the server, but the lag spikes are so bad it is unplayable with the current servers. My broadband internet connection with no packet loss and steadily low ping is definitely not at fault at this... - the passive skill tree is huge but somewhat meaningless: In the end you only go for the important nodes for your build anyways, and mistakes are costy (lots of currency orbs needed). also this concept is barely balancable and optimal skill tree builds take a lot of time to plan. If you enjoy this planning (I actually do) then this is somewhat fun but in the end the concept feels a bit pointless and when you go for certain skills there is usually not much choice if you want an optimal build. This means that there is actually not as much freedom in skilling as it may look. For certain builds you will always target the big nodes necessary for it and you will have to take all nodes on the way to there - not really exciting. The rest is just optimisation and alteration, not making much difference usually. -- We were promised new acts. The game got different kinds of new content, but there doesn't seem to be much development regarding new acts, although this is exactly what this game needs: more acts, more NPCs, more quests, more story-related content. - The skill effects and particle effects in this game are too large, obfuscating and opaque. Often it is impossible to see what is going on especially when playing in larger groups. There is no way to lower the visibility of those effects or turn them off. It kinda ruins the game in a way, but I guess some kids might like it... -- The whole game seems to be developed more towards grandstand-play and more and more customised effects, random grinding and 'loremasters' (who the heck needs that) than towards new content, balance, compelling gameplay, and fun that is less grind-related (a bot can do that..). I don't like the direction it is taking.  - Currently the only way to play this game in late-game is to have some form of AOE and/or abuse game mechanics and imbalances. AOE is necessary because desync becomes ridiculous in late game, so ridiculous you barely can play if you depend on direct hits, even if your ping is around 30 ms. Fixing desync would fix this too.

            "review_text": "At it's core , Path of exile is a good game. It contains all of the qualities people look for in this type of rpg. That being said, it is an exercise in frustration if you do not follow it's spacific formula for success.   The most glaring problem with the game is its poor net code. You will die to desync in this game. You must train yourself to constantly be on guard for the signs that your character is not synced and try your best to mitigate it's effects. This makes hardcore leagues and races tedious and saps the fun from them. No other game of this type, or any type for that matter has ever been this bad for me. The devs are aware of this problem, but have been unable to make any progress toward a fix.   If you decide to play softcore, or get sent there from hardcore, you will deal with experience loss on death. The devs are fully aware that desync exists, they can not fix it, yet they leave a punishment mechanic in game if you die, when they can not differentiate between a deserved death, and one caused by thier poor engine. At higher levels this can mean hours of grinding wiped clean through no fault of your own.   There is no pay to win mechanic in this game. You must earn everything you need to progress through gameplay. The drop rates are well tuned, but the chance of getting anything you can actually use are so low, that you are forced to trade in order to progress once you get to the end game. This is true for a lot of games, but the problem here is you have to either watch tradechat, or use third party sites to obtain the gear that does not drop for you normally. This is time consuming and tedious.   The learning curve in this game is pretty big. There are literally millions of builds that you can end up with as you traverse through the game, but many of those builds will not be viable as you close on the endgame. The most basic rule you must follow if you want to succeed in this game is, Research, Research, Research. If you just start the game , and do not do research, it is very likely you will end up at a progression wall you can not climb. In most other games, this is not an issue, as you can take the lessons you learned, buy a respec token or whatever and fix the problems with your build. This is not the case in this game. Respecing is expensive, (in game money, you can not buy a respec for real money) So you learn that you are better off just shelving your character and starting over from scratch. with no variation in the game story, it becomes just a borefest to get back to where you were previously with your new build.   This game would get an enthusiastic Thumbs up from me if it were not for the above issues. As it stands now, I would suggest to anyone reading this to research what desync is if they do not know, and see if they have the ability to mitigate it enough for the game to be enjoyable. If you decide you can live with it, I suggest you do some deep research on the skill tree and game mechanics, before you even start playing. You can find a lot of cookie cutter builds on the forums if you do not want to theorycraft yourself.   If it were not for the desync/death punishment mechanic I would endorse this game to anyone who loved Diablo 2. Instead I will have to vote thumbs down on this, as the issues I listed will not be fixed, and just cause too much frustration as you close in on your end game goals.",

Ummm...really? How is this game all that different? Same types of characters, same general play-style, and probably least attractive of all, a real-money in-game store...you know, the kind of store that D3 was blasted for. Didn't seem all that different to me!  In that same review, they PoE was also lauded for its skill system, including the upcoming expansion which makes the skill system massive. I didn't think that was such a hot plan, myself. Unlike D2 or D3, I can't see readily where any given branch leads. I consider something as massive as the expansion's skill tree to be a big detractor.  One other minor drawback for me was that I was seeing other players in the game. If I'm playing single-player, I want at least the illusion that I'm playing...well...single-player. I don't want to see other players or a noticeboard or anything like that, I want the option to play truly single-player. In fairness, there might have been options to turn those off, I didn't really go through every last thing in the 1.3 hours I was playing it.  Despite these various criticisms, I didn't really dislike the game in any significant way, I just didn't find anything that really jumped out at me. I'd give it maybe a 6.5 out of 10.",

I, however, don't think the game is fun nor worth playing; it has copied many of the most frustrating parts of other action RPGs. Not only does the game not teach you it's numerical systems (or even have a how-to-play level), but many important numerical systems are hidden, and in higher dificulties you are penalized for not understanding every single skill and aspect of the game intimately.  Path of Exile is a true F2P style game without Pay to Win systems, which is admirable, and several systems which are quite interesting academically. Sadly the overall lack of pollish, poor ballance, realism art system choice, and camera issues [too zoomed in], and extreme changes in difficulty hamper the game from actualy being fun.  There is a very vocal die-hard fanbase for this game who all tend to cry wolf all over it, raising it above games like Diablo 3. Do not read forums for this game, they are terribly misleading. The game has some interesting systems that gave promise, but it's completely without polish, and requires HOURS of research to understand the innards of a 'good build.' I do hate to use epithets , but 'you tend to get what you pay for' actally fits here. The game is playable, but also instantly forgettable. In several areas you'll encounter sharp encounter difficulty spikes which detract severly from immersion.   The realism art style is unfortunate because it hampers your ability to see, fight, and play quite often in dark places like caves and dungeons. It's blandly done realism art is over-dark in many areas, unimaginative, ugly, terribly repetitive, and detracts by distracting you from being able to easily see enemies far too often. By the second playthrough you'll find the gem-based skill system is plagued by ballancing issues, and the stat-map ends up being annoying, frustrating, and forcing re-rolling more often than offering real freedom of character choice.  Overall, the game is not as fun as dungeon crawl games that have been released before it, or even as good as Diablo 2 on which it's obviously based. I really really wanted to like this game, as several of my real life friends enjoy it. Sadly it's certainly no where near better than any of the games people claim that it is.",

If you are low level and using a slower weapon you can miss 2/3rds of the time standing face to face with a mob which is just dumb game design. Lastly, it would seem that mobs are all packed together now. As in, an entire areas worth of mobs is now packed into a small area leaving large portions of space desolate.

The abilities are quite lackluster and fail to deliver any kind of combination satisfaction. I find myself mashing the same button over and over and spinning in circles to kill mass amounts of meaningless monsters over and over with that same button. Itemization is decent, but I would really like to see some customization options, you mostly end up ignoring 98% of items that drop. There is a nice spell that converts loot into a pet that uses the gear, that was a good touch. All in all, it's a great free game to mess with, but I can't see myself becoming immersed for any extended periods of time. Yet I still haven't given up on it, I will continue to play it since at this moment, competition is pretty non-existent with the continuing slew of beginner MMORPGS trying to milk the quick cash marketplace scheme. They did a great job implementing the market here, nothing that takes away from the game, only some visual items and fun stuff that has no effect on character power. Perhaps I desire more complexity and I am looking for it in the wrong place. Even so I can't find myself bashing this game, it's just not great by any means.

Sure I wasn't getting new gear very often (one bit every 8-10 levels or so) but I didn't think anything of it. I was still progressing just fine, so it obviously didn't matter that much. But as I moved into the higher difficulties I found it becoming more and more of an issue, until eventually I reached a point where I was 'stuck', my progress had slowed to a glacial crawl and would stay that way until I got some better gear.  So I grinded... and grinded... and grinded... and grinded... and after about a week of grinding and looking at various trade sites/channels I had 1 upgrade. By this point I was just like 'F*ck it, I don't care anymore' and gave up. And that's the summary: Poor Itemisation/RNG that brings down a very good everything else.

You get attributes and passive skills from a really huge skill tree, which shared by all classes. You obtain active skills from skill gems, which can be inserted into item slots. The basic currency is the identify scoll, which is really unique in my opinion. It is a multi-mmo-coop like game, you can form parties with other players or play pvp. There are different kind of leagues to choose from, which affects the gameplay and gives it a replay value. (hardcore, ambush, invasion, open pvp etc.) The world, the lore, the controls and the action are well done, the gameplay is very addictive.  It is free-to-play, but you don't have to use the item shop to enjoy the game. (it only offers cosmetic enhancements, which is really fair) If you liked Diablo 3, you should definitely check this game out. It is much more than just a D3 clone.",

This game also proves that you can make a free to play with just cosmetic items and still make money off of it (without being valve of course). Everything in this game is also beutifully voice acted (triple a quality). What else can i say really? The graphics are great, cosmetic items that you buy are amazing, the combat really feels like it has impact thanks to the great animations, the only negative thing i can say about this game is its a little low on areas i mean you will be in the same area for a little while but you wont really mind it since everything is so much fun.I emplore you, give this game a shot, you will not regret it.",

You WILL make really crappy builds, don't worry about it. The game forums, wiki and various Youtube/Twitch streams will help a TON to help you figure it out. WHEN you make a bad build, but you aren't looking to restart from level 1, there are various ways to undo bad changes throughout the game.   I should probably take my own advice since I need to stop playing with different builds and work on one toon instead of ~6.

Negatives: - The servers (must play online) are very out of whack and all too often the mobs are not where you think they are. In effect you are fireing at an on screen ghost, or there is nothing around you yet you are still getting hit with damage. - Loot drops are terrible. The seem ok in the beginging, but there is no real progressing in quality related to player level. So it gets tiring. - The crafting system pretty much makes all loot virtually the same almost worthless value for NPC trading. So you must go to the player market. Which in itself is very tedious. - At higher levels the skill tree and playing skill becomes marginalized in relation to specialized 'must have' equipment. This destroys the self-found playing style. - The skilll tree has a major hic-up in that at best you can have only 120 nodes. This limts the real varity in character types that are playable...Most are cookie cutter around specific equipment. And it gets boring after a while as you really learn how the tree works. - There are various severe balance issues regarding combat (especially Act 3 endgame). - The casual single player is screwed, as the game design is geared toward devoted hard-core multy-player groups.  In a nut shell, unless you are all into intense socialization in order to get equipment to win, you will likely not find this game keeping your interest.",

This game, from what i've seen so far, mostly focuses on the pve aspect of things. I've tried pvp a few times, in 1v1, and it's not really that fun. It's more of a, spam your strongest skill until they die, and you win thing. But i could only be seeing the beginning. As far as pve goes, it has pretty good depth to it. The (passive) skill tree alone is MASSIVE and I mean there are hundreds of passives and by just leveling alone, you get 120, 1 point per level, but there are quests that give you extra points. The active skill system relies on gem sockets, and you may think that's not good, but they are removable, levelable, and resocketable all at no charge, except for the leveling which requires stats and a required level. But like some games that require breaking the gem or the item for the socket, this one doesn't which is great.  You can also be literally any class you want. Depending on which character you select determines your position on the passive skill tree, but as you progress, you will unlock another character which is at the center and allows the most custimization. i might not even be touching everything, but this is a decent summary. This game is absolutly great.",

Despite this, the game is very approachable, and is kept apart by its currency system, which utilizes 'orbs' which also serve as equipment stat modifiers, making their innate value to each player unique. While very grindy, this game is the most fun you'll have grinding out levels. The more recent content adds more zones with special monsters and powerful boons, again adding to the experience.

Aesthetically it's dark and gritty akin to Diablo 2 It's gameplay is much reminiscent of Diablo 2 as well. left click move, loads of loot, the tetris invintory, loads of loot, and the grindy gameplay with loads of loot.  Skills ingame are more influenced by FF7' materia system on crack, levels give you passive skill points which you use to increase base stats like move speed or bow damage, and then you reach a keystone passive such as Minion Instability (minions become nukes upon death) or Eldritch Battery (mana shield becomes mana pool) or even Blood magic (give up mana pool use hp as mana) and now you have gameplay changers.  Skills are gems dropped as loot. you equip them into their respective colored sockets in gear to use them and bind them to your keys, and sockets can be fused, allowing them to be upgraded by skill gems such as multiple projectiles, chain, fork etc; and then you get: Lighting Arrow (skill)+ (support gems:) greater multipl projectiles+chain+mana leech+elemental proliferation= now you get5 shotlightning bomb arrow that chains from hits and auto targets nuking a room  IMO the skill system allows for endless possibilites on making custom skills as they ad more and more active AND passive skills every update.  Tack on randomly generated item stats with a huge database of combinations, and you get crazy and interesting items. And the legendaries ingame ACTUALLY change gameplay style at times or even builds. Kaoms Heart (legacy) for example, you forfeit your body sockets (VERY important because you give up a possible 6 linked godly skill) for + 1k hp which turns you into a tank and is crucial in a few builds that involve blood magic.  tl;dr Diablo 2.5; if you like Diablo 2, 3, or even Torchlight 1/2 you'll most likely like it once you get used to it's game mechanics",

As of today, I have officially punched in 200 hours across 4 characters, and my love for this game is still growing.  To describe it as anything other than Diablo II with the gem system very much identical to that of Final Fantasy VII would be an insult to all parties involved. The game has a very beautiful, dynamic way of producing combat that makes you feel very rewarded when you cleverly link together a few spells and modifiers and, as they say down south, 'bring out the ♥♥♥♥ train.' The passive tree is massive, and albeit it a bit daunting at first, makes sense and while being balanced, still offers many many ways to play every class, no matter what skills you pick to rely on.  Of course it doesn't come without its list of gripes. The chat system is clunky and often annoying when trying to switch between channels, wispers, and party talk. Also, since the game is server based, the amount of 'desync' can get super frustrating. Often times you'll try killing the same enemy over and over only to have it warp across the screen as the game 'syncs' or something flinging you FIRST INTO A MOB OF MONSTERS. Did I mention you lose XP when you die? Yeah.  But that just adds to the difficulty of the game. Following in the same vein of games like Dark Souls where certain things are designed in such a way that you must do them in the most difficult manner possible, it's a real test of patience. Casual gamers might enjoy it being that it's free, but if you want to work your way to success, be prepared to devote a lot of time working through tedious item crafting and farming. If that's your kind of thing, then you'll definitely feel at home with the no-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t crafting system in this, where all of your rolls are completely random and you can often find yourself RUINING gear instead of improving it. A life lesson to be found in that somewhere, but I haven't yet.  All in all, an incredibly rewarding and cleverly designed game with layers and layers of character creation and manipulation that most ARPG's just seem to lack anymore (Yeah I'm talking to you Diablo III). PVP might be a little nonexistent (which is a shame because this game supports 1v1, 3v3, and 6v6, both conventional arena and Capture The Flag). A solid 8/10, and highly, highly reccomended.",

Best thing about the game: You can stream to twitch (providing you have an account with twitch) in game!!! No OBS or XSplit program needed! I stream using a laptop on 720p and have been given complements on how well the stream looks! GOOD JOB CREATORS! AWESOOOOMMMMEEE IDEA!",

The game has an interesting plot, inovative mechanics and you can easily play it for hours and hours. I like the characters, the spells, the PvP arenas, the quests ... and basicly everything.  The only problem I have experienced with this game comes from the fact that you are always online. So, you rely on the servers... And with this comes the trouble. Sometimes there can be lag, some creatures appear to be there, but aren't, some creatures appear NOT to be there, but in a split second the frame changes and you are surrounded and dying... Still, this is not a major problem and you get used to it quick enough. Just remember this - no boss fights when the servers are shaking and you have a hardocre character. :D",

You may even find yourself skipping areas by running past mobs, as fighting the same mobs over and over can get boring. If you bring a friend to play however, this problem can be completely ignored. I personally recomend making a witch focusing on summoning mobs of your own, as this can get really hectic and fun! It's like witnessing tiny wars, and in a 1V1 mach you can overwhelm a single foe.

This alone may put you off of this game, and there are alternatives, but none i've found have had such a good community and such a massive skill tree.

The 2.0 Patch or the big expansion brings Act 4 with new areas with new mob types and so many changes im not even going to bother with it, I would say that the game is now at its finest (some may disagree) as its no longer required to spend 1000+ just to get the real funny stuff (again some may disagree). After the expansion I started on the new league, it was like a new game. Everything has been changed, I even messed up a few times (lol, 10k+ hours) and payed for my mistakes (rerolled 3x times). Since I hate writing stuff i'm gonna end the review thing now.  Just play it, if you want the real experience just play it to Cruel (Second difficulty). At that point you've met everything you can and it will only get harder after this, but you've tried most of the features.  EDIT After 1.3 patch: After 7k hours total, 800$ spent on it and countless of deaths in Hardcore and after picking up around 12k wisdom scrolls ( I did count, I promise). I still love this game, its my favorive alltime game after Diablo 2, a new league recently started in december sometime and ive been farming nonstop (Holiday started the same day woohoo) and now wield a Mjölner and wrecking Atziri!  With the new patch 1.3 which was focused on PvP there's now more to do, I myself have been doing Low level dueling and its tons of fun! Highly recommending it!  This game offers alot for nothing, there is everything from endgame mapping to low level dueling, both of which are fun! For every Diablo enthusiast out there you should try this, it does not cost money and it does not have ANY pay to win elements, only thing you actually can spend money on is cosmetics and more stash tabs, but none are needed to play the game!  A few flaws here and there, still some desync problems and a few other things that one does not notice unless you are looking for them.  ORIGINAL REVIEW: just about to hit 4k hours in the game, had to switch to standalone cliet since Steam one was abit bugged when Forsaken masters released! Still THE favorite game for me! and put around 200-300$ in it now, and will probably purchase the 500$ pack when i get the money!  Definetly my favorite ARPG since D2! Lots and lots of diversity and building builds have never been this fun:)!  At first looks it might just be a regular arpg clone, but its so much more! Only downside i can point out is that its ALOT too learn, like it took me atleast 100 hours to get down the basics, but im a slow learner anyways. Highly recommend to watch some tutorials or read alot so you get a basic understanding of the game!",

You can buy a lot of in my opinion expensive non sense stuff like the 1100 dollar Awakening pack. But there is absolutely no pay to win. I bought the premium tab option, which is a little expensive, but needed, in my opinion. So tips and tops:  Tips:  Try to remove less XP in the Merciless difficulty, and none/less in Cruel. Since it is really hard to make a custom build and not die. So then you have to start over or find a build on the internet. So being a noob and having a custom build is very difficult, and leveling is impossible then.  Second thing is to lower the cost of the premium tabs, or when you buy the tabs, give people more.  Tops:  It is impossible to really finish the game. Since you can always get better. and there is no maximum damage or something, because you can build in so many ways thanks to the variety of weapons, and especially the passive skill tree!  Also because it is not pay to win.  Keep up the good work!  Yorgos  P.S.  I hope you can someday add another act. That would be awesome!",

It has more depth to its systems than you can wrap your head around in the first 100 hours of play, and the gameplay is so much fun that those 100 hours will go by before you know what happened. The temporary leagues keep things fresh with special new rules in each one and a fresh economy where everyone starts from scratch.   On top of how much fun the game is, the developers are just the best in the biz. They engage with their community to a degree I've never seen another developer achieve. They listen, and the passion they pour into their creation is plain to see. The game is constantly evolving and improving. The upcoming Awakening Expansion, branded version 2.0, contains TONS of awesome updates, new content, and quality of life features. Feeling like you are part of an evolving creation really adds to the experience.   The game is also truly free, and uses the most ethical f2p model I've seen. Pay-2-look-fabulous is what the community calls it. Purchases only change your appearance. There are no XP-boosters or OP weapons or anything of that sort. The only thing that has a direct impact on the game is buying stash tabs, but you get plenty of space by default and extra is only a convenience. Some people pour money into this game, but nobody has to. The people who do are absolutely in love with the game, and the devs deserve every penny.  This is a desert-island game. If you were stranded with nothing but a PC and an internet connection, you could be happy playing PoE for the foreseeable future.   There is a steep learning curve in the beginning, but as long as you learn as you go instead of trying to figure out everything at once, you'll start to see the brilliance of this game. Watch some streamers, check out the Reddit, and you'll get the hang of it in no time.  10/10 Best ARPG of all time.  ",

The graphics are on par with Diablo 2 and it's gameplay is just like every other of these games; it doesn't even try to advertise around these things, so you might ask: why Path of Exile?  Because unlike most Hack &amp; Slash games, Path of Exile is giving the player a lot of freedom of choice in how they want to play. Sure you've got your basic pack of heroes to choose from from the start, but the only thing your class sets in stone is /where/ you start off in the passive skill tree. And active skills? They're available to all classes as well, because they're introduced as socketable gems for your gear.  You're not bound to a little list of talents and skills and passive; ten levels just to upgrade one passive skill increase cold damage? Not in Path of Exile - every passive skill you take basically leads up to more interesting paths of passive skills, every level presents a choice.  And unlike most Hack &amp; Slash games, there's constant progression. There's still the same feeling of grinding randomized areas, but in Path of Exile, every grind you do can give you the currencies or skills that are just as useful at the maximum level. Even common gear can be valueable, and every currency has it's role (there's no gold or copper; currency in Path of Exile are basically tokens that can upgrade or alter gear useful at all levels!). Meanwhile, your socketed skills level up with you.  Path of Exile is more than just a grind to the maximum level and then farming that end boss for that one chest plate you really need. It has constant leagues to introduce a new challenge for remade characters and every single piece of gear and every single skill can be modified, altered and changed to suit your playstyle.  And last but not least, even if this really isn't in your alley and you'd rather go back to the wrist-straining, mind-numbing other Hack &amp; Slashes, you wouldn't have wasted a dime, because Path of Exile is free to play!",

Also, for starters like myelf, little advice. KILL EVERYTHING, I ♥♥♥♥ you not.. KILL EVERYTHING that you encounter, because quest don't give you any XP, that's right; only killing monters/npcs will give you XP, who came up with the idea of not giving XP when you finish a quest. So get ready for the grind of your life, becaue if you think that getting Invincible Reins from Lich King is grinding, you haven't truly faced it. I guess that's my only problem with this game, maybe the veterans enjoy it that way, but I'm very used to getting my XP when I finish a quest. Overall, is a great time. Yes, get it..",

Likes: + Really free to play; don't have to spend a cent to see the end. If you're broke, you can play a top class game for nothing. But support the developers if you can; they deserve it. + Quality voice acting. + Replayable. Randomly generated levels means it's never quite the same twice, and there's great art variation between areas. Beaches, forests, dungeons, cities, libraries, the depths of some hellish place with thousands of dismembered bodies strewn and piled all over the place; it has everything. And there are 7 classes to choose from.; 6 until you reach the end on normal difficulty. + Great skill tree; you're not restricted by class in what you can choose + Gem system is a neat way to pick your abilities + Regularly updated with fresh content and challenges + Popular enough to find plenty of guides, tips and theorycraft on how to tune your character.  Dislikes: - Long initial load time. I know I have an old computer, but it takes over 5 minutes to preload everything before you get to the server selection screen. - Can get laggy sometimes. Being an online game, every move must be verified by the server, so you can end up with enemies not being where they show on your screen, or an ability or potion guzzle can sometimes get frighteningly mistimed. - Has some a bug that affects me at the higher, larger levels where I crash on a load screen. Apparently it's a problem with having a 32 bit OS install. Probably won't affect anyone with a proper 64 bit OS and 4 gigs of RAM or more. But every game has a bug or two that affects someone.

It has atmosphere and dark gritty settings. There is a deep story and lore, but it is not in your face and can safely be ignored until you are ready to look at it. The game is constantly improved and built upon by the amazing developers.    Lets talk some more about the game mechanics. You build a character and level up, using your passive skill points on a large web/tree of skill nodes. This tree does not change for the multiple classes you choose, but where you start building from does. Your character's equipment mostly determines how your character plays. In addition to equipment, socketable gems determine your character's skills.  The game unfolds over 2 acts (when I baught the game), now 3 acts, now 4 acts, soon 5 acts. (This speaks highly to the constant content releases) Do not take this to mean the game is or was unfinished. The game is continually expanded. Each time feeling complete with features you didn't even know you wanted.  Buy this game.... or since it is free.... play this game, and maybe if you like it then support it financially.",

            "review_text": "Let's get things out of the way first and foremost - Path of Exile is the true spiritual successor to Diablo 2, while Diablo 3 caters to a completely different play style and niche. Both are good games, but PoE is what D3 should've been.  With that out of the way, let's start with what PoE is. It's... an action-RPG dungeon crawler from a top-down isometic perspective. Or, in short, a Diablo clone. Which's not really a ringing endorsement in itself, but rather than it does everything the genre has set out to do but better.  There have been issues within the genre since it began. Mechanics which never quite worked right, which people have been attempting to solve for ages. For example, Diablo 3 introduced health globes where enemies tend to drop healing items at the end of a fight which you can pick up to restore your health so you can move onto the next fight quickly without slowing down. The 'danger' in combat should be centered upon the idea of running dry mid-boss fight, or during a single swarm of enemies, not being worn down gradually over time and being forced to head back to down, not even to drop off loot, but just to replace potions.  Path of Exile handled this in the most elegant manner to date - your potions are flasks which are permanent items which carry a set number of charges. You consume X charges and it performs an effect, such as healing you or refilling your mana. Killing enemies restores the charges in your flasks, so you can run out during a fight, but you can also refill stuff as long as you're continually killing stuff. This allows a great deal of control for the designers on boss fights by allowing for smaller enemies to spawn to refill flasks, but also for control over what flasks do. They're not just limited to healing health and mana, but can also give defensive bonuses, speed boosts, even damage increases. You can even get unique flasks with specialized properties.  This is only one change made, but it represents a large portion of what makes PoE so important of a game: the mechanics are elegantly designed and fine tuned to make the game more fun in the direction it intends to head. It's built to encourage you to move from pack to pack of enemies, tearing through them and moving onto the next batch with as little downtime as possible. Even the level design, despite being procedurally generated, is set up in such a way that there're almost always an intuitive feel to where you're supposed to go. Following a road or river will usually get you where you want to go. If there's a crossroads with the world map saying there's exits to the north, east, south and west, then if you explore the four cardinal directions, heeeey there you go, there's exits on each side of the game map. There's not a whole lot of wandering around aimlessly and being unsure of where to go - the trick is more getting to where you want to go in one piece.  There's a lot of other major upgrades over other games. For example, the loot system is such that you can remake virtually any item that drops. Change the sockets on it, the colour of the sockets, the stats, the item quality, you name it. You can basically reroll anything you want on an item until it works. You also have a stash which innately allows the transferrance of items between characters, and it's not a small stash either, having 4 rather hefty tabs which can hold an awful lot of stuff by default. You can, of course, purchase additional stash tabs, but unlike most free to play games, they don't penalize you with a pitifully small stash where you feel forced to get more tabs - it's biiiiig by default, and buying more tabs is really just for hoarders like... uhm. Me. Even so, it's still a ton of space so it's hard to be upset with it.  There are unique game modes as well which change fairly often. As of the writing of this, the current game mode has packs of frozen enemies appear 1-3 times per map where the enemies will have one rare monster with stronger abilities and a pack of smaller enemies. Unfreeze them by poking the ice 3 times and they attack - kill them off and they drop a handy item which can be used to upgrade any normal item into a rare with a pre-set stat based on the item used to upgrade. Yes, you can customize your gear easily this way so that you never really have garbage laying around waiting for a good drop.  Other handy things include stuff like how items are broken into one of six categories: strength, dexterity and intelligence, with hybrids between each of these. Strength focuses on armour for reduced physical damage taken. Dexterity is evasion where you just don't get hit in the first place, and intelligence has an energy shield which gives you a second health bar which regenerates quickly once you stop getting hit. This makes each ideal to what they're supposed to do defensively, and fully supports the idea of hybrid characters.  To go with this, weapons themselves have specific effects built into the weapon themselves. Staves have an innate block chance to make up for not having a shield for instance, or daggers increase critical hit chance, claws innately lifesteal, swords have a bonus to accuracy, maces increase stun duration while scepters increase the elemental damage dealt by melee attacks for non-physical damage builds, or wands increase spell damage or cast speed. Even shields may have bonuses, such as innately reflecting damage. The point is that each weapon actually serves a unique function and is built around such so that you can play whatever style you want to.  The 'classes' in the game are much the same way - any character class can do anything you want. Want a full plate armour witch with a two handed maul? ...You can do that. Slightly less efficiently than another character may, but she can totally do it. The difference between classes is primarily the skill gems they can purchase easily, and their starting location on skilldrassil.  I'd love to go into more detail but... I actually ran out of character limit so I can't. Oh well.  The point is that PoE is free to play and NOT pay to win, like this's one of the very few games that you can literally play start to end for free without microtransactions at all and they don't penalize you for it. You just get nice bonus stuff for paying, but you never feel like you're missing out because you didn't. The mechanics are exceptionally well designed and quite clever, the game is fast and fun, and works great with friends. It's built with hardcore diablo players in mind, and as you get farther into the game, it keeps introducing more and more new elements to the game play to keep things interested, even for high level players. It has a bit of a high skill floor for new players, so it can be a little rough to get started, but if you like having lots of stuff to keep learning to keep you interested that's not really that big of a problem.  In short, for the type of game they're building... it's pretty much perfect. Path of Exile scratches exactly the itch that Diablo 3 didn't. It just isn't really ideal for newbies is all.",

Combat at higher levels feels fluid and allow for many different playstyles, and the game can be quite challenging at times for those that like Hardcore or just dislike dying in general. The way it deal with 'seasons' (called Leagues here) is nice, and the fact that Hardcore characters aren't instantly deleted on death, but instead transfered to the permanent softcore league, is an interesting change.  Crafting might feel overly-complicated at first, but it's actually a pretty interesting system that allows you to have some fine control over your gear, instead of fully relying on random drops alone.

Not bad, just annoying to follow.  -This didn't have to be Always Online. Dumb idea since going solo is perfectly fun (when your internet doesnt screw you over). And offline/online items could be kept separate.  -Leveling skill tree can screw your character over if you don't know what you're doing. -RNGesus... that's all.   Fun stuff:  - Really neat ability combination system. - Really neat skill tree stuff that has plenty of potential for unique characters (though many builds aren't going to do much at higher levels, and aformentioned character breaking if you mess stuff up) - neat updates rolled out optionally at first and tested by wider populace before potentially ending up in main game.  - Free to play and not Fee to pay or pay to win.  - Devs are awesome regardless of my gripes (for the moment anyway) - Microtransactions, while expensive, look really cool and aren't garbage 'one time use' stuff (minus the very few things that are, but are cheap)  If you got time, you should play this.

Con: Starts a little slow. online only, so a little laggy compared to a pure-single player game. and the complex skill graph is overwhelming.  Overall -- A Good clickfest Diablo2 clone.   But you need to be willing to sink time into it, to develop your character. Personally, my time is limited, so I'm going to try it again later.

Fan boys will say there is no problem but everyone knows the great majority of deaths are caused by server-client desyncing.   Skills and character system is only complex to the eye and in actually is easy with it being mandatory in every class or build to stack the greater majority of skill passives into health/energy shield + resists + armor leaving little variability in other passives but increased damage while complete damage dealing characters with little defense are not viable. Character level progression gets boring as each level only brings 1 new skill point (as opposed to something new &amp; exciting ie. a new skill/rune in D3). Currency system is very confusing and always in flux, however it is quite possible to get most of your viable armor from drops alone. Many skill gems exist, only a few have real significance and are frequently used by the population. End game maps are fun for a couple levels but lose their shine being turned into a faceroll. It is very easy to fall asleep at your keyboard when grinding maps.  TL:DR - A great game to experience and play until desync destroys your character or you get bored of the faceroll repetition.",

The Passive Skill Tree is massive, the skill gem system is flexible and rewarding, and the barter economy makes currency drops (the various 'orbs' of the game) exciting and fresh.   As far as the theme of the game goes, I feel it more closely resembles the oppressive darkness and hopelessness of Dark Souls than it does its spiritual forebear Diablo II. This feeling is only cemented by the cryptic lore, the impossibly ancient dungeons and crypts, and the merciless denizens therein. Though some criticize the game for being generic, I feel the atmosphere (including the solid soundtrack) are spot on and the environmental design ought to be applauded.   Were this game $60, I would recommend it to any fan of the genre (It may very well be the finest ARPG ever crafted and only promises to get better with constant updates and added content). But it is not $60... it is free. And I don't mean 'free' as in 'grind for hours or pay X amount of money for exp boosts or rare find boosts, but truly, wonderfully free. Nothing in the transaction store gives an in game advantage. Quite literally, it is all cosmetic. Perhaps one could argue that increased stash space is necessary, but the free amount of space is very generous and I could see playing for hundreds of hours without needing to expand. As it stands, there is nothing stopping you from playing this game save indifference to the genre. If you're even remotely interested in the game, download it.  This brings me to my only potential negative. The game is so free, in fact, that I'm terrified GGG isn't making anything from it. There is so little incentive to purchase any of the cosmetic items (which are, I admit, rather pricey), that I have to wonder how GGG are financing the game. I intend to buy something eventually (out of sheer guilt for getting to play such a great game for free), so my only hope is that enough others are of like mind to fund this game into the future.  tl;dr: Game is incredible and truly free. Try it. 10/10   ",

I'm sure it changes later in the game, but tens of hrs of simple chop chop is a bit discouraging. And sometimes you will die for no apparent reason as mobs will one-hit you out of the blue. This is probably due to desynch and not the game design, but it's still annoying.  TL;DR The game is good, just not fun.  You might be surprised that I don't really like the game that much, but I am still recommending it. Well, it is free and it is a quite good ARPG.

            "review_text": "This game, oh god this game. &lt;3  Where do I even begin? Let's start with the good, no, the great!  'The Great'  The presentation, is exactly what it should be. It doesn't try to wow you at the begining with a flashy high res God of War styel fight, it doesn't promise amazing graphics and realistic worlds, but what it does give you is consistancy. From what I've seen so far the game developers knew exactly what kind of budget they had to work with, what styel they wanted the game to have, and they stuck to it. The gameplay is just like diablo, with clicking to move and fight all from a 3D Isometric top down perspective. The NPCs, at least the ones I've come across so far, do all talk in text boxes, but they all have full naration with colorful accents that make them feel so much more real than any animated cutscenes could. The world feels like it's alive. While being broken up into different sections by gates, you still walk through the maps as if you were actually travling across a sprawling landscape, fighting off monsters and canibals at every turn. And switching between areas or vilages doesn't reset these areas. You'll travle back through them and see the leftover corpses and gear of fallen enemies. It makes the world you play in feel even more real. Quests require real work, not just grinding the same 'levels' over and over again like some free to play MMOs have you do. Grouping up with friends is relatively easy but there are some gripes I'll hit on later, speaking of.  'The Not-so-good'  Now I mentioned how the different areas don't reset imediately after you leave them, well this can be a problem sometimes with certain quests, mainly when you're playing in a party and the quest requires each person to collect a set of items in a certain area. I ran into this problem fairly early on in gameplay where, I would have part of the items needed to continue, and another friend had the other items. It was very much a 'first come first serve' ordeal, which isn't exactly prime for a multiplayer setup. Another thing that I find a little annoying is the Leagues system, which keeps players divided from eachother. If you have a friend you want to group up with but they're in a different league than you are, then too bad. You can't change you'r character's league either, you have to make an all new character in that chosen league. Another, albeit minor, issue I've noticed is with how the game handles trafic towns. To keep the player traffic managable in the various villages, they run different instances. Not a bad thing of course, but when players join parties, they won't always see eachother. It won't switch you from your current instance to the instance that the party is joining in, even if you're in the same town. The only way I've found around this is while you're in the group, leave the town, then re-enter it and it /should/ put you into the proper instance where you'll find the rest of your party. A minor gripe as I said, but a gripe none the less.   All in all, I'd say this game is worth playing. Is it perfect? No, not at all. But it is a fantastic gem in the Free to Play market. If you're looking for a good dungeon crawller, or just a really invigorating game to play with your friends, then I can't recomend this game enough. Path of Exile, is at the very least, a must try.",

            "review_text": "I'm on my Merciless playthrough now and this game has been good. The first half of act 1 is ok and always made the game seem very average to me when compared to TQIT, but I stuck to it and progressed through each of the Acts and found Act II and III to be much, much better with the rest of Act 1 to be good. What does make this game awesome though is the way the socket system and the skill system works. It's very customisable and I can build my character the way I like. The community and guides online are also great for the game.   The game is very addictive and if you want a game that D3 could have been, this is it.    If I was to rate it out of 10, I'd give it a 7 because even though it's addictive there are a few things about the game that are a bit too irksome to give a higher rating:  Some people love it and some people hate it, but I'm not really a fan of the bartering system because I find it a bit restrictive with vendors. This also means that there is less variety at the vendors and I always liked saving up for and buying a massive item at a vendor in games like D1, D2, Torchlight 1 &amp; 2 and TQIT.  Every time a legendary item drops, it would be amazing for 20 levels ago or it's amazing for another class. I haven't had a decent legendary drop yet and this is disappointing.   The currency items are hit and miss as well because I can enhance and item, but in order to get the item right I have to use a monumental amount of these and I find that not enough are dropping to create amazing items that are becoming more and more important as I play though. The most frustrating of these is the Orb of Fusing, which will always fuse 2 sockets together on an item, but any more than this and they get used up very quickly. In combination with Jeweller's and Chromatic orbs, this makes for very tedious and often disheartening results.   I feel the game also needs a respec NPC, rather than using Orbs of Regret. I find that as the difficulty levels get higher and the game gets harder, it becomes more and more important to have specific character skills from the skill web in order to keep progressing. This game is notorious for getting very, very hard at the higher difficulty levels (more so than most other RPG's) and this means that people need to experiment and respec more often to keep moving forward. Unfortunately in order to do so in POE, the only way to reclaim allocated skill points is to use Orbs of Regret. These are like hen's teeth because they don't drop very often and are only given on a few quests as rewards by NPC's. They can also be bought at vendors in towns, but the trade cost is monumental. This means that people have to farm to get enough orbs to reclaim points from certain lines in the skill web to allocate elsewhere and often the skill points will need to be reclaimed again because the new line(s) of skills aren't working and the only way to find out how well they work is through experimentation. This leads to more need for farming and can make the game very, very tedious indeed. The other way to get a good build is to copy other people's builds, but that takes away from the pleasure of creating and discovering one's own build.  I also find that the bosses are either too easy to kill or impossible to kill, with no inbetween. The easiest way to kill the easy bosses is to spam them head on, which works really well to break attacks and kill them quickly. The impossible to kill bosses are impossible to kill without dying because they have attacks that you can't dodge (like the whole scene filling with blood rain that does huge damage, or combo attacks with no room to dodge that are too fast to run from) and in order to kill these bosses, the only way to do it is to use a spam, die, spam, die, spam, die... victory technique. Just make sure you level before killing the boss to not loose to many exp points. Both of these methods feel very anticlimactic.   Some special monsters also come with elemental damage reflection, which is just downright annoying and completely unecessary because it defeats the purpose of having an elemental damage build. The only way to kill these specials is to use elemental damage and LOTS of healing or waste valuable skill points on a physical attack skill that does SFA damage anyway. Also, the game (rightfully so) sends wave after wave of monsters, which means that you kind of just get into a rythm of attacking constantly using similar patterns without really looking at each individual monster unless they don't die as fast as they should. This means that you won't see or notice the special with the elemental damage reflection until it's too late and you've dropped your flame totem and your aoe spells into the mob. Then, all of a sudden, you die and that's why it's really annoying!  The devs also wanted to have a d2 style inventory management system, which is nostalgic, but players have moved on and it would have been better to have a more modern system with more space.  I'm also not really a fan of how my town portals disappear and how I need to redo an area if I've been in a side area for longer than 15 minutes and come back to it.   The servers have also had some stability issues and POE seems to have a lot more lagg than it should.",

Desync happens often and one of the first thing you should learn (when you create a hardcore character) is to use the propper sync command and use it every 5 to 10 sec to not be surprised when your character dies.

Thorough review: Maybe a little overly complex for an entry level player, but for someone who has enjoyed games like this for a while it is awesome. Gameplay can be challenging if you want it to be. If you do not want it to be, you just re-run lower level areas to get ahead of the game in loot and experience. The potion system is a great renovation, which I think is a big game changer. Lots of spells and abilities to choose from. Leveling up spells by actually getting experience while having them equiped, very cool idea. Non-class system, interesting, but can be daunting for someone who is new to the genre. Honestly, my only complaint is that if you want to be a necromancer you cannot summon a full army of darkness. You get quite a few pets you can summon at once, but not a full army. Also, respeccing would not be easy, so plan ahead before putting points anywhere.  On the fact is a F2P game: I do not play many F2P games, this is the exception. This feels like a game I paid for. In fact, it is much better than games I have paid for (I am looking at you Diablo 3). It is in no way a 'Pay to win' business model. I've not purchased any items in this game so far, because nothing has really looked appealing to me. I probably wouldn't use most of those items if they were given free. I'd like to see some skins, permenent weapon effects (glows, change skin, etc), and skill animation changes. Things that do not effect gameplay, but make it more fun.

First with the good; The story is well done, and I actually found myself talking to npc's to get more bits and pieces rather than feel like the usual mmo of spam clicking the quests. Areas feel different and varied, and the execution of how you can either go solo or with friends really caught my eye in making the world feel just at home with someone wanting to play single player, but have multiplayer mechanics there to hop into at basically any time. The higher difficulties feel well balanced too, only running into one type of enemy that felt like a wall while the rest had the right amount of challenge to be invigorating, but not frustrating; rewarding, but without driving you to the point of rage.   Now with the nitpicks; The sphere grid is enormous, and even though I was familiar with the gameplay style I wanted, constantly felt unsure what was the best path to take, and whether that path would see me all the way through. I found myself more often than not having the chat off due to divisive topics with immature reasonings being argued, among other things.   All in all, I still immensely enjoyed the experience, and could easily recommend the game, especially with it being free-to-play. Being a fan of Diablo I felt enough at home to hop right into some of the mechanics, but was greeted with enough new tweaks and additions to where the experience felt unique rather than copied.

Path of Exile is one of the best free to play games I have played and I would recommend it to anyone who likes RPG's.",

REFLECT. you can 1 shot yourself dead =) an attempt to add originality to the game i guess. the game suffers with a problem called.. DESYNC, it usually teleports you to the nearest monster mob and results in your death, the higher the level your are in, the greater the loss of xp you lose upon death. a death can lose you DAYS of gameplay when you get to the level 80+ it is a good game in a few ways, but the irritations currently outweigh the fun",

I will start from the comparison to Diablo 3...First PoE was better than Diablo 3 because it didn't have auction house,was free to play and had darker setting.Endgame was better and more fun than Diablo's.I too liked it more because it was free :D But now when i finally bought Diablo 3 along with the expansion Reaper of souls which improved D3 and made him the game it had to be the day he was launched...(Bought it from here real dirt cheap compared to other sites..And if game doesn't have your region,just buy Europe and change it with the help of customer support)..So..From the start i have more than 50 hrs in D3 and 18.6 in PoE...Does that mean i preffer D3 than PoE? Well not really...PoE has it's dark setting but D3 colorfull graphics suit me better..So let's start comparing.I would like to start from the combat first...In PoE you have COMPLETE freedom of designing your own skill tree!!! And that's beatifull...Do you wanna throw knife that goes through your enemy and returns like a boomerang or you will modify it to throw 3 knives?The choice is yours.There is also MASSIVE passive skill tree in PoE heavilly influenced by Final fantasy X...D3 has linear leveling system which i don't completelly like and the joy of leveling isn't good as here..But the feeling of combat itself is slightly better for me in D3 than in PoE...It's more dynamical..Second comparison..Random generations...The biggest and only difference is that PoE has bigger maps than D3 which i don' like and i will explain that in third comparison...The loot...We all play games like this because loot and randomly generated maps...So what's the problem here?Map is basically crawling with strong and rare monsters which drop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of loot when killed...How is that bad you ask? Well your inventory is soo smal it can sometimes hold only 7-8 armor pieces or weapons...And that's serious problem because i am completionist who usually picks up everything,sells it in town and then return...This is so slow and iritating because of that...In one location you have to go to town 5-10 times which is annoying and hard...PoE is first Diablo like game where i stopped picking up all items Diablo 2 being the second...I once asked Ziggy (the PoE famous streamer) on twitch:Why don't you pick up all of this great loot? He then told me that none of that is awesome loot but that he will pick up rare weapon that just dropped from some monster..So yeah that's lame for me actually.Another thing that i don't like but it's also present in Diablo 3 is map and monster respawn...OH GOD HOW I HATE THAT! There must be some progress shown to you or atleast illusion of progress...I feel like someone slapped me when i see the map that i cleared 20+ minutes respawned...But,that's my personal problem...Fourth comparison is currency...Here in PoE you don't have gold like in D3...I don't have any complaints on that but it's destroy the feeling of hoarding gold to me like a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like we all are when we play games like this...So..Is a PoE bad game? NO! It's a grat game which i like very much...Developers are really nice and kind for letting us play game like this for free..And they keep balancing the game and pumping out free content...And that really warms my gamer heart...So don't listen to troll rewiews and start playing PoE.

The highlights however: The story is a little rocky and I didn't pay much attention to it, there are a couple details here and there which seem to contradict each-other, but then again...I didn't pay much attention to it. The economy is extremely interesting and well-balanced, running completely on a barter system. This was a risky move but it works so incredibly well. Every character class is extremely mold-able, and there are very many different builds to choose from, the skill tree is MASSIVE and is honestly a little intimidating at first, but you quickly get the nuances of it. From a technical standpoint, runs decently, no complaints. Some people get frustrated with connection issues, but I've never had that problem myself. Races give a huge bout of replayability and accessibility for the speed-running community. Art style and voice acting are rather generic, some sound effects are nice though. The game is either extremely easy or extremely difficult, it spikes without warning. (Kind of like every other isometric hack and slash.)  I've played this game through a couple times, once as a dualist and once as the unlockable class. I think I've spent maybe $5? on stuff in the store.

It's more of a, spam your strongest skill until they die, and you win thing. But i could only be seeing the beginning. As far as pve goes, it has pretty good depth to it. The (passive) skill tree alone is MASSIVE and I mean there are hundreds of passives and by just leveling alone, you get 120, 1 point per level, but there are quests that give you extra points. The active skill system relies on gem sockets, and you may think that's not good, but they are removable, levelable, and resocketable all at no charge, except for the leveling which requires stats and a required level. But like some games that require breaking the gem or the item for the socket, this one doesn't which is great.  You can also be literally any class you want. Depending on which character you select determines your position on the passive skill tree, but as you progress, you will unlock another character which is at the center and allows the most custimization. i might not even be touching everything, but this is a decent summary.

            "review_text": "This is what we were waiting for. For what seems like a decade, we have been waiting for the next Diablo game to come out. Diablo III was finally released, and while many touted it as a good game, it was overall a disappointment. Which is why it is so much more satisfying that a F2P game hit steam and outdid itself. This game is being promoted by many (myself included) as what Diablo III was supposed to be. It is one of the bravest games I've seen during my 'gaming career' so to speak. One giant passive tree on which to build your character and a bunch of skill gems help to piece the rest together.   Grinding Gears Games offers a promise of never being pay to win by offering purely cosmetic items to purchase. With the game being absolutely free, there is no reason not to give it a try and I highly recommend that those of you into RPGs give it a go. There are numerous character classes that can be built any way you want them to.. Even though it doesn't make sense to be a summoner when you roll as a marauder, you could do it if you really wanted to. I said that it was brave because PoE is offering a fresh take on RPGs with a passive tree that is used for all of the classes, albeit starting in different areas of the tree. During your time in the game you will search for gems which will help you gain access to new abilities, while still providing the thrill of getting that long-awaited piece of gear you've been searching for.   The game gets more difficult as you go, there are 3 difficulty settings and as you make your way through all of them, you will start needing to think a little before you walk into the next room. Currently we are on Act 3 in cruel, which is the second difficulty, and I'll tell you right now; It is difficult without having someone there to help take damage. 3 damage-based builds are nice, but they mean nothing if you can't get off more than one or two spells before being slaughtered.   The only negative to this game is rubber bands. I can't even count how many times I thought I was hitting a mob of baddies and it turned out I was 10 feet away and almost dead. The server issues are mostly likely attributed to the fact that the game is free to play, and unfortunately may never be fixed. Developers must certainly be worried about allowing players to host their own servers when playing with friends because it would become much easier to exploit the game, which is unfortunate to say the least.   All in all I highly recommend this game as it is free to play, if you don't like it after hitting level 20, then maybe this just isn't the game for you, but all you'll have lost is a few hours, not $40.00 for a similar game. If it weren't for the lag issues this game would get a perfect score from me, as it is I have to give it a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "First - PoE is free to play but not 'pay to win' so there is no reason for you not to try it out. You can stop reading and start playing now or get some impressions below:   PoE follows in the steps and is clearly inspired by Diablo 2 though with some MMO-elements like timed events and competitions. Some might claim it is the spiritual heir to Diablo 2 which is open to heated debate since Diablo 3 alienated many old-time fans (simplified skill system, itemization issues, auction house). Anyway this a classic and well-executed action-RPG and you spend much time thinking about builds and item combinations.  Skill 'tree' is a huge labyrinthic pattern actually and you have to choose carefully which road to plot with your skill-points so you end up in the areas you want to skill. An ingenious idea and I hope to see more like that.  While passive skills and attributes are earned with level-up-points on the 'tree' classical active skills are available through gems which you socket in your items and they also level with fighting like you. Since sockets and gems come in red/green/blue flavours and also linked type gear selection becomes complex fun. A mace might have great damage but no red-blue linked sockets for example.  Because of this system any class can become any kind of fighter or mage but there are clear preferences depending on where the class starting point on the skill pattern. Like the witch starting with more magical choices and few melee options near the starting point. You'd have to use up skill points to arrive there.  There's no gold in the game. Items are sold for consumable item pieces like 1/8 identify scroll. Items are again bought with consumable items like a whetstone which you could also use up to improve your gear. Choices again...  PoE works great with friends but also single-player however you still have to be on the server to play with the usual disadvantages such as lag, disconnects and down-times. (I'd pay them to have an offline single player mode) Also after a few minutes the areas/instances are reset so if you spend too much time shopping you might start back at the last waypoint with fresh monsters and a new randomized map. The game is FREE however so I don't complain at all, right 60€-Blizzard?   Go play now.",

GGG has done a wonderful job in creating PoE, an ARPG the way it should be: killing, more killing, and even a hint of killing on top of that. However, a number of issues are prevalent such as the ever-present 'desync' problem encountered by numbers of players; causing you or your enemies to lag around sometimes to your own death can be very annoying.

            "review_text": "Short form/TL;DR: A good Diablo-like game with MMO elements and an insanely complex progression system for the geekiest of gamers. Enjoying it quite a bit, and at the price, what's not to like! There are minor warts, but nothing to spoil the innovative and well executed gameplay features.  Long form:  Path of Exile looks like Diablo. It has click-to-move like Diablo. It has two status globes, one red for life and one blue for mana like Diablo. It has item rarities structured and colored like Diablo.  The comparisons go on and on. Path of Exile is an Action RPG very much styled after Diablo.  However, it's important to understand going in that this is not a Diablo clone. You'll see this most strongly at three points in the very first section:  1. When you kill the very first zombie that shows up on the starting beach, it will drop a gem for you to socket into your gear. This gem isn't a power-boost or enhancement. It IS your single starting class skill. In fact, all gems in the game are one of two things: class skills or enhancements to other skills. There are no other skills in the game, and all classes can use all gems if they've trained the requisite attributes for them.  2. When you first level up, you will be allowed to spend a talent point. At first, your eyes will bug out a bit because the talent tree is ... daunting. It's larger than your screen, even at good resolution and zoomed all the way out. It's a web of every possible talent for every class. That's right, no class gets their own talents. Classes are only there for two things: 1) aesthetics like character gender, voice work and size 2) where you start in the class web. Other than that, eveyone gets the same and every talent is passive. You will never get another button to press by taking a talent!  3. When you reach the starting town, you will want to sell your junk for gold... but there is no gold! Instead, you get these baubles that have special abilities like turning a normal item into a magic item or giving a magic item a new ability. These are the 'currency items' of the game and can be spent with vendors for gear, used to upgrade existing gear or saved for later, end-game uses. The fact that these items have a use of their own means that the usual 'gold sinks' required in MMO Action RPGs like Diablo 3 just go away in this game. People will 'spend' currency to either get higher level currency or upgrade items at the end-game, so it will constantly flow out of the economy, naturally.  Overall, this game is well balanced, excellently designed and a joy to play.  That said, it's not all roses. There are some drawbacks:  1. The game UI cannot be scaled except by having a higher resolution display. This is very annoying to players used to modern, scalable games. Similarly, windows can't be moved, the minimap (which is off by default, but can be turned on in the options) is non-interactive and many other expected UI features just aren't there (yet?... I hope.)  2. The 'microtransaction' store isn't. It ranges from around a buck for trivial, essentially useless things to $120 for a full package of features. In general, expect to spend about $20 for anything you might really have your heart set on like that nice pack of 6 extra tabs for your shared bank ('stash'). This will probably change, as right now there is very little reason for players to buy and almost none to buy more than once. Eventually the store will have to become a recurring revenue stream for them and will have to encourage even players with very little disposable cash to spend a little. One big positive though: there's absolutely no hint of pay-to-win!  3. The game can be very harsh at times. Your character's progress is advanced by completing objectives and by hitting 'waypoints' which you can teleport back to, but the locations of these waypoints is not always clear, and it's possible to get several maps in and die, only to find out that you missed a waypoint on the previous map!  4. The game has a very annoying shared loot system, similar to Diablo. This annoys me more than any other problem with the game, and is most of why I don't group with others very often. I'm just tired of seeing a nice item only to lose out to a melee player who is always going to click on the gear faster than I will because I'm standing at range. The game really needs a loot system that encourages playing with random people and not just your close circle of friends.",

The paid aspects is purely cosmetic, and a pure non-requirement towards progression, or a complete game.  As far as gameplay, this game is a Diablo Clone. However, the game integrates a series of mechanics to make it stand alone in an all-too-familiar genre: First, there is an expansive... and I mean expansive... passive skill system. A couple hundred to choose from and to progress through, akin to FFX styling. For active abilties, the game follows a materia-style system, where equipment has colored sockets, and you can match abilities, or supporting abilities to the corresponding colored sockets. Skills then proceed to level based on XP gain of the user.  All in all, the game definitely scratches the Diablo itch, and has increased replayability relative to the Diablo series due to the expansive passive skill system, and class selection. However, due to having similar gameplay of the carpel tunnel inducing clicking, Path of Exile does suffer from the same eventual genre fatique that fell upon the three Diablo itterations.  All in all, I'd give this game an 8/10. Considering it's price (free), I'd highly recommend picking this up and giving it a shot. If nothing else, it'll help scratch the Diablo itch.",

In addition, the way you customize your character (any class can use any skills as long as they meet certain attribute requirements) is actually quite ingenious and well-executed. The bartering system (there is no 'gold' in this game; you trade items for useful consumables and vice versa) is also accessble and is quite appropriate given the game's setting. It also acts as a natural countermeasure to inflation because the items you trade with (e.g., identify scrolls) are always useful in their own right.  If there's one complaint I have about this game, it's that the game can frequently lose synchronization, and you find yourself apparently striking the enemy when in fact you are swinging at air. This is solved through the slash command /oos but it still happens frequently enought to be of moderate annoyance.  However, that doesn't detract from the fun I've been having even playing this game casually. And at an outrageously low price of $0, you don't have much to lose by at least trying it.",

It has all the loot based dungeon crawling you could want. Bosses are challenging. There are numerous modes of play from Softcore, Hardcore and ever changing modes that get switched out every couple of months.   Many classes, albeit gender locked (why can't games learn to knock this crap off?) to choose from. An unlockable class. Skills are tied to gems you find and socket into your weapons. Passive skills are unlocked as you level up across a GIGANTIC skill tree.   The community might bash you for it. But It's advised that you research the skill tree before you roll a character.  Otherwise you risk wasting hours of play just to end up with a self-nerfed character that can't complete the later levels of the game.   That being said. If you know what you are doing. You can create insane builds that can trash the game. Become a god-like harbinger of death that wipes out entire groups of mobs in the blink of an eye.   Gear works much differently too. Socketed items are plentiful. But the color of the sockets and whether or not the sockets are linked play a big factor.  All those details aside. You'll get 3 Acts to beat and 3 levels of difficulty. With end game maps to loot and use to keep a fresh loot filled experience going.   Unique weapons are not like you would expect. This isnt Diablo 2. They are not all powerful items. Many of them have trade offs of having a lot of life, attack, or attack speed - but will lower you're resists, defense, magic find. This is just an example. Its sometimes frustrating. To pick up a long awaited Unique drop to find out the item is actually junk. Kinda like early Diablo 3 uniques being inferior to Rare's.   The game looks good, plays good. Its free. It supports guilds, trade and party play. The community can be annoying and immature at times. Plenty of trolls to feed.   Overall its a solid game. And its free. So there isn't any excuse to not try it out.",

When you first open the skill tree it's very overwhelming, but it starts to make sense when you really get into the game. The skill tree is only passives. Spell and skill casting is done by aquiring gems which needs to be placed in equipment sockets. There are great resources and tutorial videos on the web.   The game has superb graphic quality but lacks alot of imagination and any interesting art direction. Generic looking monsters, few interesting. But considering their budget must have been 1/4 of a regular ARPG studio, this is pretty stellar work. On a brighter side this crowd funded game has been active and supported by the dev's religiously, which means it's worth investing time and money in.  What is respectable is that the game is not Pay to win, but you can pay for extra stashe tabs and cosmetics which is extremely fair which helps fund PoE.  The biggest issue with this game is the DeSync and it does suck when it happens at a Boss map. There's also the Trade Chat which is overly busy and hard to follow, usually most players turn it off. The game also has spam in the chat leading to third party 'pay real money for unique equips' considering that the game is Free 2 Play it's easy for these spam sites to keep recreating accounts.   I'm not a fan of the Diablo series, but aware that the developers wanted a 'true' sequel to Diablo. The game has a great community, however the underage crowd has started to gather and makes you want to turn off the global chat. But I feel this game will continue to grow, and hopefully will get the needed polish it deserves.  ",

            "review_text": "An Isometric hack&amp;slash in the style of Diablo 2, free to play without any gameplay restrictions.  The most asked question when choosing between different free to play games usually is 'What do I get for free ?' In path of Exile - you get the whole game, period. No restriction on classes, content and a very fair amount of characterslots (I haven't hit the cap, having around 5 playable characters at a time) and four times the stashspace available in aforementioned Diablo 2.  Spending money will get you visual distinction in the form of unique item effects like flaming swords or golden halos around your head, more storage space for yourself or your guild or , for those with a lot of disposable cash at their hands - a unique item,monster or mechanic you design with the developers.   There are no game influencing items for sale. No experience boosts or better chances form magic items - nothing you can buy in the store has a mechanical influence on the game.  The game itself evokes flashbacks from days gone by - the world feels desolate and hopeless, with gore and brutality all around. Which is not to say that the game would look bland or ugly - quite the opposit. The engine presents the continent of wraeclast in a lot of detail, with sufficient lighting and particle effects to stand among modern titles.  It does not come close to the visually impressive Diablo 3 though, which might be an issue for those seeking the latest and greatest in visual fidelity.  The story of Path of Exile is simple at first, with a few twists and revelations strewn in throughout the campaign. It is interesting to listen to, offering a decent amount of background and 'fluff' through optional NPC conversations and objects throught the maps. The story won't rewrite the genre - but it takes some risks and provides a unique perspective  The gameplay is satisfying to say the least - skills are gained through gems offered as questrewards or monsterdrops and can be combined to alter the effects and usability of skills, giving players an unlimited amount of possible combinations. Aside from skills, characters gain passive skillpoints for each level, with choices ranging from mundane '+X life' to completly game changing 'convert all evasion to armor' for examples.  These system offer players chances to customize their characters in a myriad ways - some more viable then others, but each unique. If nothing else, this will set the game apart from diablo 3's prebuild characters.  For players seeking a challenge beyond the (for my taste) quite steep progression beyond the first playthrough, the game offers unique events from week to week - challenging players to run characters through custom dungeons in the fastest way possible, without access to a town etc.  For casual hack&amp;slash players, the skill and passive system might look intimidating at first, but it only takes an hour or two to find your way through it until you'ld be able to build the character of your dreams.  In summary - I recommend this game to casual fans of the genre as well as seasoned veterans as everyone will find a worthwhile experience. The amount of brutality on display is not suitable for minors or those faint of heart. Those might want to check out Torchlight 2 instead.  As always - no rating. Judge the game by how many hours of entertainment it gave you.",

It's completely free-to-play (all shop items are cosmetic only), The skill tree is a bit intimidating, but as all the skills are passive, you don't really have that many difficult decisions to male. I also really like the barter system and how potions work (they fill up as you kill enemies), The 'socketing' system feels a little unintuitive than a level-based system, but I've often been left wondering whether to ditch a piece of equipment for a better one or keep it for the coloured sockets. The game is also very solo-friendly. Art and music are also great (some really creepy enemy designs).

And if you do want to help out GGG by buying some stuff, everything that can be bought is completely cosmetic.   Do yourself a favor and try POE out, you will not regret it. I certainly didn't.

PoE offers a wider spectrum of customizable gear compared to the others in the relation that you can take a simple grey/white item and use an orb to convert into something you will use for quite a while. The sphere grid format of leveling up with passive skills also makes you get taken back to games like Final Fantasy X where you have so many possibilities to go with your build. The gem system is also quite interesting in that all your active skills are revolved around the gems you place into your gear and there are gems that can alter or strengthen your skills. In a lot of ways my friends and myself agree that Path of Exile is where Diablo III should have been when it first came out if that says anything to you just give it a try.",

The game is easy, you have to play for hours and hours to get to the higher levels before you see any challenge at all.   The greatest disappointment is the always online play, this means you well regularly lag. Often you will be swinging your weapon at an enemy hitting nothing and then it disappears or enemies will die 2 seconds after you kill them. It is very distracting and takes away from the game.  More importantly because it is online only, there can never be mods for the game. The community cannot create their own custom content or make the game their own. The way the developer decides the game is, is the way only way it can be.  A minor note for me is the uniques. I have never had a unique drop and have it be usable for the character it droped on. The uniques are always for a lower level or for a completely different class. Sure there is a shared stash and the uniques can be handed over to lower level characters, but its still sad knowing that when I identify the unique it wont be usefull.

            "review_text": "Path of Exile is a dungeon crawler click 'em up brought to us by New Zealand Developers 'Grinding Gear Games'. It draws inspiration from various games such as Diablo and Torchlight II yet still has enough in there to feel like a new game. Gameplay, Art Style and even the voice acting and sound design all nail the dark and gloomy dungeon crawler vibe. There are currently 5 classes to play with an unlockable 6th. Each class can become anything throughout the game though so what you're really picking is where you want to start on the (very large) skill tree. So sit back, drink your co-coa, yell to your mom your reading something and let me tell you my tales of Path of Exile...  So this game seemed okay (and free, with purely cosmetic micro-transactions) so install it I did. Fairly small-ish game coming in at 5-6GB so it only took me a few hours. The first thing I noticed when opening up the game was how beautiful the loading screen was. Rain puring down with sad music playing in the background with 'Path of Exile' in 3D text. A good start but I guess a loading screen can't mean much. I created an account and was then forced to choose a class. I chose shadow and quickly went through 2 or 3 quests (up to level 5) before I quit, deleted him and decided to make a witch. I was seeing all of these summon items and I thought rasing an army of my own would be cool but the summon passives where next to the witch. A new character was okay at that point, I didn't even have any good gear. Upon creating a character (listening to the witches back story first of course) you're confronted with the shores of a beach. Nothing really happens and I'm sitting there staring at the screen for half-a-minute before I think to click. My character, MrKadius, coughs and gets up. A survivor sits up on a log. He tells me what I must do before the dead guy next to him bites his head off and I'm left to fend him off with my new-found 'Driftwood Wand'. As I wonder down the beach I'm confronted by more of the 'Drowned' and a few little spider things that have poop guns built into them or something. After a while of clicking and sometimes right-clicking I found myself at this giant zombie boss. He was easy enough and killed him first try. I met up with some friends of mine I was talking with and their characters. Our total group was a Marauder (tank), Hunter (archer) and a Templar (healer type guy). We made a good team but I must say, this game with a party is far too easy. We breezed through the whole of act one with no one even getting CLOSE to dying. The challenge did not come until Act 2. The first death we had was when we were actually forced to choose between helping a guy (three of them across the map) or killing him. The two sides of the party must fight to the death. This is actually the way most of us died for the first time. I managed to survive but only because my summons where being meat shields while i attacked with my fireball reign of death. We ended up calling it a night after that quest. We continued playing... thoughout the month... until Act 3.  It was a fun Journey to endgame (we're still noobs). This game is fun polished and insanely clutch in Act 3. I keep getting on and running some maps every now and then so it has replay ability. Then one day, I was going to log on and reluctantly hit create.  Brilliant. 9.5 out of 10",

It's fun to play and playing with the map systems and rerolling the mods on those maps to make them harder is really fun.  The bad thing about this game. You see this game have no real end game, I mean sure there are maps to play when you beat the game and those maps 'supposed' to keep you busy and try to upgrade your character more to do harder maps and see how far you can go but the problems if you just want to play the game high lvl maps will almost never drop for you. Lvl 68-73 maps are easy to get, lvl 74-76 little bit harder but you can get them and those lower lvl maps get old fast (you will only bbe stuck with those low lvl maps and nothing higher drops) the real problem is with lvl 77-82 maps this is where the fun is. More like those higher lvl maps is what you worked hard for this is why you geared up your character to do but those maps almost never drops for normal players even if somehow you got a lvl 78 which is hard to get. Chances are you are going to see alot of lvl 68-70 maps dropping which is very insulting.  Another bad thing is trading. If you want to trade you have to use third party website and third party program that let you open your shop. even when you do those. say now you want to shop for an item you go look it up and find what you want but too bad the seller is not online you have to wait for him to log in and chances are if his price is good if he logged on and you pmed him like 5 minutes late the item will get sold. The other problem is many sellers abusing this by listing their items very cheap to trick other people to sell it for that cheap price but when you look it up it shows as these people selling it but they are always AFK so good luck finding what you need with the price you want.  The last bad thing about this game are the devs themselves, people have been suffering from map drop rates and have been asking the devs to make higher lvl maps easier to get but all we got from the devs are ( yea we buffed the maps drop rate) they don't give any numbers on how much they buffed it and after each buff it seems actually it got nerfed not buffed. on top of that the devs went on and nerfed the exp that high lvl maps give just becuase some dude on twitch was able to reach max lvl in 1 week so they punished everyone else, and speaking about nerfs if you want to play this game make sure you are ready to switch builds all the time (and by switching builds I mean making new characters from lvl 1 and having to beat the game 3 times before doing end game maps), if you played a build and find it fun to play even if you have a low cost budget build but still enjoying playing it. There is a big chance that it will get nerfed tomorrow because it's only a matter of time until one of the top streamers find a way to abuse that build or find a way to make it even stronger when that 1 guy do that you will get your build nerfed and ruined. nerfs are not only about builds but even monster farming. There are some monesters that have a good chance to drop good loots, SOME people abused 1 build to farm those monesters none stop the devs went and nerfed the drops from that mob. Instead of doing something to stop those farmers the devs punish everyone else and for normal players like me and 70-80% of poe players we didn't do that and we got punished as well. in the END to me and many other people who played POE it seems the devs are only working to make the top 5% poe players and streamers happy.  So if you decided to play the game be ready for the most punishing game and unrewarding game where there is no RISK VS REWARD more like RISK VS NOTHING. unless you can be one of those top 5% players and a no lifer.",

Combining classic Diablo II with modern ideas and gameplay, Path of Exile boasts a diverse skill tree, a seemingly infinite number of skill combinations, and an innovative crafting and currency system.  With a steep learning curve, and an unforgiving skill system, the game is challenging for new players. Fortunately, the community is mostly full of helpful people, including a well-documented wiki, a variety of great streamers, and guides to the game all around the internet.   Trading is, sadly, the most-lacking area of the game, and also one of the most integral. Use of third-party sites and tools is allowed - encouraged, even - by Grinding Gear Games, but hopefully they'll implement their own system.  If you enjoy aRPG's, this is definitely one to try.",

I was about to give this game a really low rating, it's just to simple to go through the small closed maps with hordes of monsters coming right at you, you just click and click without much of tactics in your mind. But i got stuck playing this game as intensely as I played Diablo I. And now 38 hours later on my third day playing, I'm through the first two thirds of the campaign part of the game. And I have really enjoyed the game as it has grown on me, with the complex experience points map, the special attack gems and their support gems and slots. It's really enjoyable to go through the inventory optimizing the farmed equipment, upgrading and gambling for better rarity and more gem slots. And then when you're satisfied, just go out and bash through hord after hord of vile and disgusting creatures. My only complaint is that it's just a little bit too easy, or maybe I'm just been lucky with my equipment. I've only died a handful of times, and that's just because I got to casual with my gaming and just didn't see the creature who was pounding my head in. I killed the big bosses after each chapter on the first try just frenetically clicking away with my best attack skill. The games atmosphere is really cosy and suggestive, it's easy to get lured in the dark woods and caves. I'm surprised my laptop (i3 w/ SSD) with Intel HD3000 graphics could handle the game all right, but then again, I'm not that spoiled with eye blinding high def. eye candy. One has to take in to perspective that I'm well in my thirties and I still enjoy playing DOOM I and the likes. And that I'm still amazed with the stuff, for example, the Unreal 3 engine can produce.  If you are still hesitating... just don't! Download this great piece of free to play game, forget about eat and sleep and just click away!",

The game constantly keeps you on your toes with the amount of sheer craziness and quantity of enemies that appear; of course, I only played on hardcore, so this was only amplified.  The community is much more active in this game than Diablo, they have ladders every season to see who becomes the most successful in hardcore mode. That player gets HUGE recognition in the community.

Each character has a different starting point on a 'grid' with tons of passive bonuses, most of which are small, but a few that can completely change the way you play. Each character is easily able to reach another characters section of the passive skill tree, so you can play in any way you want, though it may not be optimal  The active skills and spells that you make use of to attack come in the form of colored socketed gems, which you can combine together to make new skills, if your armor's sockets are linked together in the correct way, and the correct color to hold said gems. Part of the fun of the game is getting the perfect armor piece for the skill you want to mix together  Unlike other games of the Genre, this game does not use a 'currency' system in the traditional sense. Instead, it uses a barter system based on 'orbs' which can be traded, or used to modify your equipment, such as adding sockets, changing the color of Sockets, reforging the magical stats on your equipment, and many other effects.  The cash shop is non intrusive, and is filled with thing that are not remotely necessary for normal play, such as alternatative skill visual effects, cosmetic armor skins, and extra stash tabs, though the game does start you with 4 large tabs, which I have personally never been able to fill.  Aesthetically, the game is very similar to Diablo 2, with a dark, realistic artstyle, though obviously, much less dated.  Finally, the staff and support team are very active and friendly, updating the game and fixing bugs consistantly, and responding to support inquiries very quickly.",

            "review_text": "If you do not have a mainstream AAR to play, this is a very good choice as it features a very addictive gameplay and leveling aspects that, despite being repetitive in gameplay are still an enjoyable experience. If you enjoy storylines and following a campaign, this game is not for you. The animation is clunky, verging on completely lacking smooth biological motions, and models lack detail. Also you will be playing a tank at the current patch (1.0.1) regardless of any 'build' you attempt, making half of the shared passive talent tree essentially completely worthless. The 'skill gems' are identical to 'materia' (compared to FF7), and you will find yourself using the same 2, maybe 3 active skills just like any other AAR. In addition, the primary form of survival will still be potion mashing, and while they use charges you will find yourself using town portals as part of boss mechanics to refill your potions. This aspect is excessively bad design, as most classes are unable to sustain themselves against higher difficulty bosses causing what should be epic battles to be interrupted, further put down by the fact that because of this your character should essentially never die which removes any desire as a self-proclaimed hardcore game. Programming errors are also quite abound, as rubberbanding will happen indefinitely to both your character and the mobs you are engaged in. You may also, for example, find yourself spamming a ranged ability at a group of mobs in a doorway only to find that for some unexplainable reason they are not being affected by your ability. Finally, the community is absolutely atrocious due to the free-to-play nature, with only a small handful of players who actually get far enough into the game to make a proper judgment. The bulk of the game population are those who did not enjoy other AAR games (for whatever reasons) and therefore continually spam global channels with arguments and comparisons.  This game is not a substitute for Torchlight, Diablo, Titan Quest, or any other of the classic AAR games as it does not offer even half of the variety and expanse as these games do, in almost every aspect. Because of it's complete lack of a proper class system (not a bad thing) it has no place being compared to other AAR games which feature self-sufficient classes functioning in unique ways to stay alive without relying on potion mechanics. This game 'sells' on being free and having an (enjoyably) easy initial playthrough, after which most players seem to quit as they realize they do in fact have to follow a very narrow selection of builds (just like any other AAR) and have essentially 'screwed up' their character in the passive tree.  Now for the good points; this game is highly addictive, as stated before, and all of the problems listed above are fixable with balancing patches and service updates. Being able to mix and match gems such as 'curse on hit' or 'cast spell when damage taken' are what save the skill gem features, and instead of focusing solely on the stats on gear you are rewarded more for having good sockets/links for your abilities. The higher difficulties are challenging, and while there is little variety in what you are doing (if any), you will still enjoy smashing a giant group of mobs with dynamic spells and ability chains. There is also supposed to be regular content updates every two weeks, and an expansion for early 2014 planned, which are some of the key points which save the approval rating for this game.  78% approval",

            "review_text": "'A game that takes a minute to learn, but a lifetime to master.'  That was the quote on a game of Othello that my Grandpa gave me. Path of Exile really fits the same theme. You install the game, pick a class, wake up on a stranded island, zombies everywhere.... ok good so far. Then you pick up your first weapon with some sockets and a gem and you're like 'Hey, I've seen this before...' but the gem gives you skills instead of stats so that's kind of cool. And so you whack a few mobs and it's fine, but then it happens - you've reached level 2. You gain a 'passive' skill point represented by a little plus sign at the bottom of the screen. And so you go to click on it to place your skill like so many games before and it is at this point where your jaw drops off your face.  The skill tree is like a mandala. An interwoven tapestry of perks, stat points, and modifiers. As you hastily scroll around you get the feeling like choosing any number of different nodes could lead to a completely different experience. It's like the game designers thought of the game's evolution similar to some monks plotting paint out in a Tibetan monastery.  And so your journey begins.....  Overall, I have to give this game a 8.5/10. There are many excellent, excellent things about this game - including the coveted 'fun' factor. But there are some glitches in the games mechanics, such as desyncs and somewhat dated graphics, that hold it back from perfect. Also, I'd really like a better method of trading in game than trade chat.  What do I like? The complexity and the simplicity. For instance, you get your skills from gems. Those gems can increase in level as you gain experience, so maybe your fireball spell goes from level 1 to level 2. Pretty simple, right? Well, maybe later on you come across a new type of gem - a 'support' gem. Maybe this gem increases the impact radius of another gem. So slot that puppy in on a linked piece of equipment with the fireball gem and BOOM, bigger explosions. What's next? Well, maybe you want to shoot more than one fireball with an increased chance to ignite monsters into walking candle sticks - yes, please! What's better? Get that gem to level 20 and you can vendor recipe it for an improved quality gem that makes for even better fireballs.   I could go on, but I think it is best to put this in a frame work of other similar titles out there. Path of Exile is what Diablo 3 should have been. It is simply the greatest spiritual successor to the enjoyment felt by Diablo 2 fans in that game's heyday.   Enjoy.",

I downloaded it immediately and played almost non-stop for 60 hours. My only negative remark is I don't see the point in playing through the 4 acts, and then replaying them again, and then yet again (each time the difficulty goes up and your level is higher). The game is clearly designed to be a grind-fest, in the hopes that you'll eventually waste money on something stupid like fancy looking armor or more storage (wayyyy over priced). My recommendation to get the most out of this game is A) don't spend any money and B) play through the 4 acts 1 time, with a few different character builds, and then stop playing. Once you turn it into a grind to hit the level cap and get the best in slot items for your build, the game stops being fun.",

Because in the Hardcore leagues if you die you go to standard and like I said I don't play regular mode. I have met a girl playing this game, multiple friends who play this game and even a dev who was in the guise of a Hardcore League player. I haven't reached max level in any league because the challenge is real. Screw Dark Souls, this game you can't fudge anything. There is a system and rules with a over 1000 point skill tree, you can make whatever character you want, but you need resistance with it lol. Any who liked Diablo or thought the third was a cop-out, PLAY THIS GAME. It's that simple, even add me to your friend's list and I can anwser any questions or even help you kill a boss. The community can be a little memesie at times, but other than that we are awesome. Give us a try and join the hardcore leagues if you want a challenge, or the Normal or Hardcore mode if you just wanna experience the fights but be able to die lol.

            "review_text": "After playing extensivey for quite some time now I feel I am ready to write a review of my own for this game called Path of Exile. WHen it comes to games like this, it is very common for the average player to compare this game to DIablo 3, or the diablo series in general. I do not want to go to far in depth between these two games but essentially this is how I distinguish Diablo 3 and Path of Exile from one another.  Diablo 3 is the simplified RPG which is mainstreamed for casual gamers with incentives to continue playing for hardcore gamers. Path of Exile on the other hand is mainstreamed as a complex game for hardcore gamers with the ability to casually play the game. While DIablo 3 has some complexity depending on some legendary items you choose, Path of Exile takes complexity to another level with the passive tree, sockets in gear, links between gear, as well as skill gems. As such the chosen class plays a smaller role in the overall options available to each character. Since skills are gems you can use them on any character you want should you have the basic stat requirements to use them. This applies to all gear as well. As such creativity in builds based on class, gear, and skill trees is far superior than in Diablo 3 in its current state where essentially your max level set for your class is the current best set to use or to combine with a select few other legendary items.   Besides the complexity and flexibility in creativity that Path of Exile provides it also has created a currency system that does not depend on actual currency such as gold that is common in other games. Instead it uses actual items in the game that change statistical values or rarity of other items as currency. The more rare the item is the more valuable, as such Mirror's of kalandra are the most valued item in the game based on its likelihood of dropping as well as its ability to make a complete copy of an item to trade or sell to others.  Path of Exile also makes sure to always keep the competitive feeling high in the game. While Diablo 3 has recently added leagues, essentially the league system is a failure. It puts players against each other on the same base game as normal and the only benefit of playing on the league servers is for rankings, a poor skin set that you won't finish till season 4 (if you play all seasons to level 70), and a select few legendary items that eventually will be added to standard servers and arguably are not worth starting over for and waiting 2-3 months to get it on standard server. Path of Exile though always has lots of challenge leagues going add which give you points to get legendaries that you can't get anywhere else. Whether it is just a reskin of an item already in the game, or an entirely new one, it is always worth doing it since it will be valuable to sell to others later. Likewise placing high is rewarded even more which truly seperates yourself from those with less skill.  Finally Path of Exile actually does require some skill. In Diablo 3 there is no skill, essentially get your max level legendary set and you are good to go for torment 6. Path of Exile though no matter how good your gear is, you are still killable and you will eventually die. Even the best players in the game can and have instantly died during leagues when they never thought it was possible. Path of Exile is a learning experience and you will always be learning. There are always new things to try and then when you think you have tried it all there is always short length challenge leagues such as 1 hour endless ledge where you get to test your skills even more and show off how much you know about each character early game as well as how to level those characters the most efficiently early game to reach the highest level possible in the least amount of time.   In Short  Complex Flexible Creative Gaming = Path of Exile Simplified Easy Grinding Gaming = Diablo 3",

WHO IN THEIR RIGHT MIND WOULD FIGHT MONSTERS LIKE THAT!!!  - lol rant over, may not bother you like it has me and armor that covers the legs does exist...so i've been told... - just get it its better than most games, and its free",

The only downside is the game gives you weapons at random, rather than weapons targeted to your build unlike Diablo 3 and this can get truly annoying when you craft a certain build and you are only getting weapons that are ineffective for you. This is really the only flaw I can copnsider in this game, I would rate it 8/10.",

The story takes on a bit of a darker tone, much like the earlier Diablo games. There's quite a bit of lore to be had in the NPC dialog and the various quests.  Some things that set PoE apart from the pack:    Free to play with a good micro-transaction shop, no pay to win here.    Quests are sometimes multi-faceted. Certain quests let you choose different outcomes.    Tons of optional content to be explored.    Active skills are socketable gems, and your repertoire of abilities can change as you play and enemies/chests drop new skill gems.    Gigantic passive skill tree completely separate from active skills. Similar to the sphere grid system from Final Fantasy X, where you can progress along a route of passive skills to reach the passive skill sets you want. Tons of customization and some really unique and game changing passive skills.    In game shop currency is based off of materials/components, rather than a gold/money system. It helps keep all items relevant, and lessens the 'gold sink' problem that you find in many other games.  I could go on but, if you like isometric action RPGs, or you enjoyed games such as FATE, Diablo 2, Torchlight 1 or 2, or Titan Quest, you'll be right at home here with PoE.  It's free to play, so you don't have much to lose just giving it a try. ",

Talents are confusing because once you open the talent tree you will see thousands of talents and you don't know where to start. Yeah, I could start on any talent point but I have no idea is better to have X then Y. Leveling for me is rather slow, I play for 2 hours just to be level 8. During this 8 levels, I see only crap loot dropping. Blue and gray colored items and when something yellow drops, it's not something I need. It took me a while to realize that gems provide 'new spells' that you can use and seems that one item can have like 5-6 sockets regardless of being it a weapon or armor.  I don't like that for each level you just have 1 talent to spend and you spend it on stupid stuff like 10% projectile damage, and when you test it, you see it is not a lot. As some people say, you can never reach max level which gives some nice longevity to the game but other things I mention could be done better just to avoid that confusing part.  - Diablo 3 -  I thought before to say like 'Path of Exile is same s*** as Diablo 3' or other way around but there are differences. In Diablo as you level, you unlock your spells and passive skills so you can get the hang of your class as you level. Diablo has level cap of 70 which everyone can reach but you make your character stronger by earning paragon levels and on them you don't have limitation. While Diablo 3 doesn't have such huge talent tree, getting specific sets or legendaries allows different play styles.  - Conclusion -  Path of Exile is free to play and it's quite good. Graphics in my opinion are quite s*** since to me it looks like FIFA 2001 just from different angle view and even that angle view is strange. Even though combat looks okay I can't to not mention that sometimes I have feel that responsive element to shooting arrows is not quite correct. Sometimes just shooting in direction works, sometimes I have to click on target.  Diablo 3 is not free at all and probably that is why some things are done better in this game. Overall feels more solid. Combat style feels quite heavy in both games (in the late game) but simplicity is what prevails at me which makes Diablo more appealing.  I liked diablo 1 and 2 and If you liked it as well, play this.",

Overall quite a good game even for casual players.  11/5/2015 *Update Review* I have decided to review this update as I have tried the new patch with lockstep netcode, melee is alot more smooth then it was pre-patch, and I have not noticed any rubber banding at all. Quite a substantial upgrade to the netcode of the game in general, have not tried the new act yet but the game is a ton better with deterministic lockstep.",

(Some basestats and the starting Area in the Skilltree differ from Character to Character)  Then you get thrown in to a World without really knowing what to do. After a while of fiddling around you Come to a Town which gives you some sort of direction.  From here on you just start going a somewhat linear Path while Collecting loot/XP/currency and slowly build your own Character that you want.  Currency which will be found at Random can be used to Improve/Alter Items  Positive: +Massive Character developing options  +Gear  +Skillpoints  +Skillgems  +Skillcominations  +Uniqueitems +Different Areas  +Randomgeneration +Currency System  Negative: -repetetive grindfest at some point  8/10 Overall really good",

This includes the monetary system which are orbs that you upgrade items with that people use as currencies to trade for other items. This makes a lot more sense to me than gold in an ARPG since Gold quickly becomes a useless resource - people used items in high end Diablo 2 trading as currencies anyways. This game just streamlined the process. +: The passive skill tree and skill gems are 10/10 amazing, deep complex systems that work fantastically and provide a lot of depth to character building. +: The flask system is a lot smarter replacement to potion spam in my opinion, and I prefer it to how Diablo 3 does it with the health orb / potion with a cooldown combo. +: The cash shop is completely fair and this is one of the few F2Ps (alongside DotA 2) where you get the actual entire game for free, everything else is just looks or minor convenience (like stash tabs). Zero pay to win. +: Limited time races for rewards and long duration leagues with special gameplay mechanics (that often get integrated back into the main game in all leagues) are amazing. +: The end game system of maps (with their own unique modifers and such that can affect the entire map) is pretty cool, and makes them more engaging than Rifts in Diablo 3. -: It does get a bit repetitive, but this is something a lot of ARPGs have problems with to be honest. Thankfully, it being free means you aren't really hurt much if you get bored of it for awhile.",

Think of it like the Dark Souls of Dungeon crawlers. Except it also teabags your corpse.  On top of all the wonderful customization abilities with the enormous passive skill trees and skill gem system, a large reason I play is because this game has a rediculous amount of atmosphere to it. Beautiful music, wonderfully dark and gritty even by typical dark and gritty standards. Abysmal and hopeless, yet somehow still inspiring curiosity and wonderment regardless, and letting the idea of hope entertain itself on the horizon. And the snippets of lore is interesting enough to keep you enthralled inbetween bouts of absolute slaughter and carnage.",

            "review_text": "Looking at all the reviews and comments on about Path of Exile and comparing it to Diablo. I mean, yes Diablo was the first of its kind but its not the only game of this genre? Is it genre? It's an rpg game. There are other games like so. Titan Quest for example.  What Im trying to say is, when you play Path of Exile, when you first starting to play path of exile. You have to take it under concidiration that PoE is not Diablo. And Diablo is not PoE. They are different games. Like League of Legends and Dota, they hold the same concept but they are very much differnt.  Path of Exile is a complex game for those who just got off Diablo or never played such games before. It takes time, and I mean real time, to get a good grasp on how it works and why it works such way.  Many loose it when they see the size of the passive tree, it is big, I agree. Then there comes the confusion with abilites and currency, it is odd, maybe. People struggle with inventories, they don't like tetris. They pick up evey dropped item to sell it for scroll fragments and they complain on about the lack of space. They give up so soon they don't get the taste of the story, and then ofcourse say that story is boring. Struggles between hit and move, Finding a waypoint, etc.  Path of Exile could be not what you are used to. It may seem like an alien and you have to take it slow in order to not ♥♥♥♥ up ur character. Becasue build does matter.   PoE players would often, if not always, recommend you to look up a good build online. I refused to do that becasue I felt like it's not so hard. My thoughts were if you have your stats up, gems in order, shiny armor, then you are good to go.  No, I didnt ♥♥♥♥ up. I actually figured the game out quickly becasue I didn't play it like Diablo. I played it like the game it is. Im having a unique experience, becasue I gave time to understand the game.  So if you arent sure if this game is for you becasue it is so different from what you normally play. Don't let that scare you. Give it time, give it a thought.  Fix your keybindings, explore your tree, don't pick up crap.",

You will need to 'beat' the game 2 times in order to reach the end-game ·Hard grind. Hours and hours will fade away. ·7 characters , but this aspect is not similar to D2. The passive tree is the bigger i've ever saw in an RPG. The characters will determine the position were you will start in the tree, being able to make thousands of thousands of builds. ·There are no 'Sets' but there are many Uniques. ·The skills are not from the passive tree. Are gems that can be socketed into the armours, making you able to use it, and you can even link them to 'support gems' which will grow the potential of the skill.  Now to the good an bad:  + The company and the system they use which is F2P. There are no 'Limitations' to make you unable to play the same way as the others players (The stash would be the exception) + The variety in the builds you can do . Are almost infinite : Minions builds, archers, warriors , block builds, caster , even supports ones. There is the Meta though , but you would be able to do many builds without problems. + The community. Is pretty big and that's make easier to do groups to leveling or trade, and so on. + The duration of the game and the difficulty of it. There are 'leagues' with some kind of thing new but the important thing is that all players starts from zero (You can still play the normal league 'Standard' without losing any progress) + Softcore and Hardcore. Each one has their own league. + Economy. That thing it doesn't have D3 . You have webpages like poe.trade to sell and buy things of the game (Not for real money but with the currency of the game) + Fast gameplay. The first difficulty can last less than 1h with a good build  · I need to explain what is fast for me:  - Titan Quest for me was reaaaally slow making you hit an enemy like 10 times, here you will kill one  with 3 hits as much. + Short the 2 first difficulties, ♥♥♥♥ing long the last one. Because you have the end-game in that stage  - Performance. You will need an SSD to play properly without spikes. - Updates and how are being installed. A 4mb patch can last for about 1 to 10 minutes. - PvP(optional for me). Don't expect a good support in this aspect. - Really high curve of learning.  - Grinding Gear Games often nerf some skills making them useless and power up others making them the main build in that league. - The game is becoming more and more casual since 'Ascendancy'. It can be a good thing too, though. - Maybe the price in the cosmetics . From 40 bucks to 120 , even more, for a complete armour skin. (I really don't mind though, they need to earn some money)   And that's all i can think about the game. It's really enjoyable and fast. I really recommend it and even support it with real money.  PD: FU Atziri and Izaro.",

            "review_text": "Oh boy, this is gonna be a long one...  I can confidently start out a review for this gem of a game by saying that this game has ceased to disappoint me in any way. If you like games with a story, games with completely unique playability paths, huge skill trees, classes, valuable and currency, and more, then this game is a game you will enjoy.  STORY/PLAYABILITY: Basically, in this game, you get plopped into a somewhat complex storyline that has a bit of background you may want to read up on to really understand why you kill certain things, who you are killing, where you are going, and what you want to achieve by the end game. Once you do this, it is very interesting to see how the story plays out, and how you are able to accomplish goals. You complete the story mode/campaign a total of three times; each time gradually becoming more difficult and each growing in more consequences for each time you die. The three difficulties are Normal, Cruel, and Merciless. In normal, there are no consequences for dying, and in Cruel you lose 5% of your exp, and in Merciless you lose 10% of your exp for every time you die. It may not seem like alot, but it is aggravating when you realize how much you lose. Moving on, after you do beat the three difficulties, this game has EXTREME replayability. You can explore the new addition to the game; the Atlas. The atlas contains DOZENS upon DOZENS of maps in different tiers, getting harder every time you move on to a higher tier. At the end of the Atlas, you defeat someone of extreme difficulty. No spoilers here. Hehe...  CLASSES/SKILL TREE: This game has 6 different classes to choose from for different styles of gameplay. It has the Ranger, Shadow, Marauder, Duelist, Witch, and the Templar. Each of this having their certain spot on the skill tree to satisfy the play-style of each class. For example, the Witch is in such a place on the skill tree that has things like mana, mana regen, and mana cost close by as the Witch uses spells, mainly, that require mana. Same thing goes for the other player-types in this game. Although each character's appearance, gender, and personality are not customizable, they each have their own preset personalities and appearances that you do tend to get used to fast. What I love particularly is how humorous these characters can be as they react to killing an act boss.   PAY TO WIN OR PLAY TO WIN: Two words, absolutley not, this is a play to win game. This game does not contain any microtransactions that contain things that are required to advance in the game. However, you can buy cosmetic effects, pets, and account features that make the game even more enjoyable than it already is. For example, you can buy a cool little frog that follows you around in the game and you can buy armor effects or skins that alter the appearance of how you look ingame. They are very cool! Account features are things like extra stash tabs, extra character slots, things that make the game easier. None of these things limit you ingame.   CURRENCY: This game contains numerous forms of currency that all vary in value, rarity, and usability. Currency, in general, can be used to buy other items from vendors, or to customise your current equipment to fit your needs. Trust me, the amount of joy you can experience when a valuable piece of currency drops is amazing. Think of it like this, how would you react if you found a 50 dollar bill on the ground? Exactly the same as if an Exalted Orb dropped here.   PVP/OTHER PLAYERS: Players here can friend other players, form parties, join guilds, and complete the story together. Also, players may pvp eachother, or join the public arena. There are multiple forms of chat including Global, Guild, Whisper, and Party chat.   In all, I would definitley reccomend this game to anyone. I really do think it deserves more praise than it gets, and having played 200+ hours at the time of writing this post, I think I have made quite the trustworthy judgement. Check this game out if you crave a good game to play.",

There's no nickel and diming you either, the only things you can purchase are extra tabs (you start with 4 massive inventory tabs so there's really no need to buy more) and cosmetic crap.

            "review_text": "It is so odd to think that this game is free. Like absolutely 'Never, Ever, Ever Have To Pay A Dime' free. When I first signed up for Steam I recalled hearing about this game a few years back.... a game that was supposedly a well-done Diablo Clone with a Skill Tree that had literally hundreds upon hundreds of nodes.... allowing an unprecidented level of character depth. I did a little digging and found out the name of this game was Path of Exile. I decided to give it a whirl, finally having a decent enough computer to bother downloading Steam and get back into the pc games I'd been missing for the last few years while I sojourned in Console Land. What I discovered was NOT a Diablo Clone. It was a Diablo Killer. And that massive skill tree? Sure, it was there.... but it was only one of many, many things that Path of Exile got right.  Where Path of Exile and Diablo are similar is in that they are both Action-RPGs that lean upon the Kill-Loot-Levelup-Repeat schematic. What Path of Exile does is give you previously unknown levels of freedom in terms of developing your character. Any class can use any spells/weapons/armor/etc as long as they meet the level and stat requirements. That aforementioned massive skill tree has a Magic section, a Dexterity section and a Strength section but there are tons of sub-sections and tons of clusters of nodes here and there that you can 'travel' towards using your skill points.... meaning you can be a mage that eventually uses your skill points to link to the section that a straight-up Warrior/Fighter would have started at.... and then start putting points into stats and skills that said warrior would have been putting points into in the beginning of his/her character building. While you'll find people that swear that there is a 'best' way to build a given character... I've built maybe 4-6 characters so far and had a blast either picking whatever was my immediate 'best' choice for skills or finding areas of the skill-web (skill-tree just doesn't seem like an appropriate description) that I wanted to work towards and forgoing immediate benefit for long-term planning.... and even when I've used the same class I've ended up with wildly different characters.  The 'skill-web' i've referred to doesn't give you actual combat abilities.... for those you find Gems. Different melee attacks, magic spells, etc all come from gems either dropped from enemies, earned as rewards, or bought. That in itself doesn't sound too crazy.... but you can LINK the gems. Add ice effect to a fireball spell and turn your enemies into burning ice-cubes. Add lightning to a melee attack to electricute your enemies as you strike them. You can have up to 6-way links and there are more types of modifiers than i could list here. Turn a single fireball into a wave of fireballs..... then add poison to those fireballs. As you progress you get more and more unique abilities and modifiers.... summon zombies... then add a speed gem to make them faster, an ice gem to give them ice damage, a crit-up gem to make them more likely to score critical hits. I've yet to earn any of the truly legendary high-level gems or modifiers.... but they can get quite creative as you get into higher levels.  None of the aforemented details would matter if the game itself wasn't any fun. Let me assure you: I played a bit of Diablo 3 and found it pretty fun.... I never went back after playing Path of Exile. The moment-to-moment action is gratifying and challenging and you get loot and new skills often enough to make the grind worth it.... but you are not getting such a glut of stuff that you are awash with super-rare legendary gear. Unlike in Diablo 3 you won't necessarily find yourself leaning on 2 or 3 skills.... rather you'll have enough cool attacks that you will likely have to swap some out en mass when you get back to a hub.... especially since the gem-linking system highly rewards experimentation. The game designers are ALWAYS adding LOTS of new content..... and not little stuff.... like entire new chapters to the already lengthy campaign. They even give you all of the passive skill points back if they redo the skill-web so you can redo your skill points and take advantage of the new goodies they've added. This is the kind of dev that earns the good-will of their customers to where they'll pick up some cosmetic stuff in the Path of Exile online store just to support their work.... yes, they DO sell cosmetic in-game items but NOTHING that gives you any kind of advantage.  It's free.... so even if you give it a try and decide it's the worst thing every created by human hands: you have lost nothing except a little time... but it's quite possible you'll find your next favorite game.",

The reason is, is the fact almost everything is free with the OPTION of microtransactions which are not nessecary unless you really want to. It has so much content packed with many abilities and such. With a new expansion coming out, can keep you going. It is problay the best you can get for a free non subscription mmo. But honestly sometimes, you have to pay for fun or to win like in some other mmo's. Thank you for reading this and honestly I can rate this as a 9/10, as it is very enjoyable.

            "review_text": " 'Path of Exile'  is a usual Hack&amp;Slay/Action RPG like Sacred, Titan Quest, Diablo, etc.   TL;DR : Recommended. 8/10. It's for free, updates are often, sometimes new content and it has a high replayability because of it's temporary leagues and the skill tree freedom.     The long version     Desc:  The darkness tries a takeover and you are going to stop this madness. You fulfill quests like killing monsters to get rewarded with experience, gold, items. Killing monsters will do the same: dropping loot. You level up when your current XP reaches the maximum. A level up will give you skill points which can be invested into new skills. Until now there is nothing special about 'Path of Exile' - instead of the skill tree. As long as your character isn't a Scion your skill path is a bit fixed, but that doesn't matter. From here you are completly free by choosing your type of gameplay. Not like in any other RPGs you are not fixed to choose only between a double, tripple or a round attack as warrior. You can transform your warrior into a ranger, a mage or whatever you want him to be. Each play through will be in a certain league. There are permanent and temporary leagues. Each league has special abilities, like special items dropping only in this league or 'Slaying enemies in a killstreak grants Rampage bonuses'.  This freedom and the combination of leagues generates a really high replayability, because each character and each runthrough is different.   Pros:  + for free since beta (and will probably stay free) + infinity freedom creating characters to your needs + really nice skill effects + replayability by using leagues with special abilites for each league (+ to have a feeling of 'procedural' level design, they are twisting the map, interesting gambit) (+ steam achievements)   Cons:  - Story (as usual .. the darkness tries a takeover) - Mainquest has voice actors the rest is presented in scrolling textboxes   Recommended!    8/10 ",

In other games creating and leveling a new character is a pain but in this game you would want to create a new one because experimenting with skills is just soo much fun.  2. The game can be played on low end pcs, we live in a world where games improve their graphics x 100 every year and not everyone can keep up, but this game runs surprisingly smooth, yes the game is not the best looking but i think thats not really important when you consider the game is more on the top down perspective view and most if not all of the time you will be seeing your character from above  3.its free to play module is really fair, unlike 89% of the free to play market, the game is not pay to win and i beleave that most of you will have just as much fun as someone spending hundrets of paunds without giving them a penny :)   thats all",

        {
            "review_text": "Let's get things out of the way first and foremost - Path of Exile is the true spiritual successor to Diablo 2, while Diablo 3 caters to a completely different play style and niche. Both are good games, but PoE is what D3 should've been.  With that out of the way, let's start with what PoE is. It's... an action-RPG dungeon crawler from a top-down isometic perspective. Or, in short, a Diablo clone. Which's not really a ringing endorsement in itself, but rather than it does everything the genre has set out to do but better.  There have been issues within the genre since it began. Mechanics which never quite worked right, which people have been attempting to solve for ages. For example, Diablo 3 introduced health globes where enemies tend to drop healing items at the end of a fight which you can pick up to restore your health so you can move onto the next fight quickly without slowing down. The 'danger' in combat should be centered upon the idea of running dry mid-boss fight, or during a single swarm of enemies, not being worn down gradually over time and being forced to head back to down, not even to drop off loot, but just to replace potions.  Path of Exile handled this in the most elegant manner to date - your potions are flasks which are permanent items which carry a set number of charges. You consume X charges and it performs an effect, such as healing you or refilling your mana. Killing enemies restores the charges in your flasks, so you can run out during a fight, but you can also refill stuff as long as you're continually killing stuff. This allows a great deal of control for the designers on boss fights by allowing for smaller enemies to spawn to refill flasks, but also for control over what flasks do. They're not just limited to healing health and mana, but can also give defensive bonuses, speed boosts, even damage increases. You can even get unique flasks with specialized properties.  This is only one change made, but it represents a large portion of what makes PoE so important of a game: the mechanics are elegantly designed and fine tuned to make the game more fun in the direction it intends to head. It's built to encourage you to move from pack to pack of enemies, tearing through them and moving onto the next batch with as little downtime as possible. Even the level design, despite being procedurally generated, is set up in such a way that there're almost always an intuitive feel to where you're supposed to go. Following a road or river will usually get you where you want to go. If there's a crossroads with the world map saying there's exits to the north, east, south and west, then if you explore the four cardinal directions, heeeey there you go, there's exits on each side of the game map. There's not a whole lot of wandering around aimlessly and being unsure of where to go - the trick is more getting to where you want to go in one piece.  There's a lot of other major upgrades over other games. For example, the loot system is such that you can remake virtually any item that drops. Change the sockets on it, the colour of the sockets, the stats, the item quality, you name it. You can basically reroll anything you want on an item until it works. You also have a stash which innately allows the transferrance of items between characters, and it's not a small stash either, having 4 rather hefty tabs which can hold an awful lot of stuff by default. You can, of course, purchase additional stash tabs, but unlike most free to play games, they don't penalize you with a pitifully small stash where you feel forced to get more tabs - it's biiiiig by default, and buying more tabs is really just for hoarders like... uhm. Me. Even so, it's still a ton of space so it's hard to be upset with it.  There are unique game modes as well which change fairly often. As of the writing of this, the current game mode has packs of frozen enemies appear 1-3 times per map where the enemies will have one rare monster with stronger abilities and a pack of smaller enemies. Unfreeze them by poking the ice 3 times and they attack - kill them off and they drop a handy item which can be used to upgrade any normal item into a rare with a pre-set stat based on the item used to upgrade. Yes, you can customize your gear easily this way so that you never really have garbage laying around waiting for a good drop.  Other handy things include stuff like how items are broken into one of six categories: strength, dexterity and intelligence, with hybrids between each of these. Strength focuses on armour for reduced physical damage taken. Dexterity is evasion where you just don't get hit in the first place, and intelligence has an energy shield which gives you a second health bar which regenerates quickly once you stop getting hit. This makes each ideal to what they're supposed to do defensively, and fully supports the idea of hybrid characters.  To go with this, weapons themselves have specific effects built into the weapon themselves. Staves have an innate block chance to make up for not having a shield for instance, or daggers increase critical hit chance, claws innately lifesteal, swords have a bonus to accuracy, maces increase stun duration while scepters increase the elemental damage dealt by melee attacks for non-physical damage builds, or wands increase spell damage or cast speed. Even shields may have bonuses, such as innately reflecting damage. The point is that each weapon actually serves a unique function and is built around such so that you can play whatever style you want to.  The 'classes' in the game are much the same way - any character class can do anything you want. Want a full plate armour witch with a two handed maul? ...You can do that. Slightly less efficiently than another character may, but she can totally do it. The difference between classes is primarily the skill gems they can purchase easily, and their starting location on skilldrassil.  I'd love to go into more detail but... I actually ran out of character limit so I can't. Oh well.  The point is that PoE is free to play and NOT pay to win, like this's one of the very few games that you can literally play start to end for free without microtransactions at all and they don't penalize you for it. You just get nice bonus stuff for paying, but you never feel like you're missing out because you didn't. The mechanics are exceptionally well designed and quite clever, the game is fast and fun, and works great with friends. It's built with hardcore diablo players in mind, and as you get farther into the game, it keeps introducing more and more new elements to the game play to keep things interested, even for high level players. It has a bit of a high skill floor for new players, so it can be a little rough to get started, but if you like having lots of stuff to keep learning to keep you interested that's not really that big of a problem.  In short, for the type of game they're building... it's pretty much perfect. Path of Exile scratches exactly the itch that Diablo 3 didn't. It just isn't really ideal for newbies is all.",

The end game map system is very nice.",

The only thing this game is really missing is WASD keys and some equiptment depth, i would love to see those impliminted. It has a very deep lore and long questline for each of the six classes, dualist, witch, shadow, templar, marauder, and ranger.  Fully voiced npcs with unique phrases for each class and decision you make. (btw there's decision making). Probably the best skill tree iv ever seen, the idea of using gems rather than actual equipted skills is nice. Camera angles and panning is great, graphics are absurd for a free game. Large amounts of items to find and character customization. However i wish the developers where more balanced and included more items, they often become repetitive to find. Enchantments system is nice, farming is rewarding. 9 maps to explore with their own expansive details. I'd give this game two thumbs up if i could.   *Users be way if you have a weak stomach for dead bodies and guts.* (this isnt much of a problem after the first map)  Why are you even reading the reviews anyway, its a free game, just play it and find out for yourself.",

            "review_text": "[sellout review for the steam sale badge] Premise: Path of Exile is a dark-fantasy ARPG, heavily inspired by Diablo 2. It has a deep customization system, allowing you to create any kind of character you want.  Introduction: I could complain how in recent years the game got faster and how that's not cool, how the balance is always slightly off and all, but generally..  Execution: this game's awesome. This game is a sandbox for all the creepy characters you can make with it. Witch hurling fireballs? Not hipster enough? How about a witch that burns her surrounding, but herself along with it. You realize you better do a different class for that, but your Skyrim sense of 'i won't let that mountain defeat me' is tingling. So you get your resistances over the usual cap with special items, you get tons of regen, maybe you can do it as an Energy Shield instead, you figure it out. It works, it actually works, holy molly. Then you think to yourself... There's this item that let's me using a Vaal skill (like a MOBA ultimate), if i could sustain it, elemental damage would heal me instead... And there's this really obscure item that reduces my elemental resistances to zero, so... You break the game. Now in proper conditions your character is immortal. Well done. So a crazy idea pops into your head, and you roll with it. Game can be played both casually and in hardcore modes. There's a racing scene (short events, mostly who clears Act 1 the fastest for example), for which you get actual rewards. This game has the content.  Problems: some balancing problems, that are quite understandable, especially if you consider the game's developed by a small studio from New Zealand. This is definitely the part where i should go bonkers over performance problems. Glad to say tha with DX11 beta client they are pretty much gone and the game even looks better. There are some glitches, Ubisoft-style object geometry glitches, but i can smell the bright, bright future. This was holding the game back more than anything else.  Business model: I feel you really need to buy more stash tabs through microtransactions to have *real* fun, but considering how much time you can get out of this game, it's worth it. Note: better buy a supporter pack, keep your points until the stash tab bundles are discounted, then but them.  Overall: it's worth leveling at least one character. This type of game's is not for everyone, but you might end up getting hooked. I seriously suggest watching some streams to learn more about the game, the community is pretty great.. Unless you're trying to trade with them, but oh well. I'm really glad this game exists.",

I think this game is the epitomy of action RPGs, right up there with grim dawn, and certainy better than D3. The skill system is incredibly deep, with new skills being made all the time (though the new blight skill was released pretty weak unfortunately). While the passive skill can be incredibly daunting, I think it is best to make a new character and run in completely blind. You will probably ♥♥♥♥ it up, not going to lie, but you get to experience everything first hand. From there, find a skill that you wish to play and look up a guide for it. This let's you learn how to build your passive tree and how supports and skills interact. This game is a must-have for any action RPG fan who was disappointed by Diablo 3.  Pros: 1. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY FREE TO PLAY 2. Fun, immersive, and deep skill system 3. The game gets a new challenge league with new mechanics to explore every 3 months 4. THIS GAME IS COMPLETELY FREE TO PLAY 5. There are free expansions every 6 months that add a ton of new content to the game, like the recent Atlas of Worlds expansion that added a ton of endgame bosses and map overhaul 6. Tons of hard content to master 7. THIS GAME IS FREE TO PLAY 8. Race seasons with cool alternate art rewards  Cons: 1. You may get screwed by people when first trading 2. Microtransactions are stupidly pricey 3. Stash tabs, while cheap, feel almost necessary to trade efficiently (though you can certainly get by with those given!) 4. Passive tree can be daunting 5. Leveling will get boring when you have done it several times every league ",

Path of Exile(PoE) is an isometric hack n slash in the style of diablo 2.   The game takes place on the island of Wraeclast where you are marooned. The story may seem cobbled together, but it is very fragmented. Its kind of like dark souls. You find scraps of info on the history and the people of the island and how it has come to how it is now. If your not into that style of storytelling(I certainly am not), you can just go to the wiki for the game and learn everything about the world you are in. It gives you a sense of purpose when you understand how royally screwed you are when you release what is going on, and makes the struggle a lot more personal.  The gameplay is tight and fast. Very fast. To fast sometimes. Its visceral as hordes explode into ash or fall as ice cubes around you. The most satisfying combat in any hack n slash, in my opinion. There is so much customization of abilities and builds that a quick peek at the forum will have you dumbfounded at the lengths people go to on how to get a level 5 bow to work against endgame bosses and the highest level content available.   The economy does away with gold. No one uses it on this island. Its just shiny floppy metal that doesn't kill the monsters infesting this island. And this game and the people in the world live to kill everything. And in a game where you armor decides if you get cut in half or you sword decides if you cut them in half first, what better economy is there than gear? Well, items called 'Orbs' that can improve gear. There are various orbs that you will find in the game that can alter the properties of items, potentially turning a clunky old necklace into god tier amulet that defines your playstyle. Orbs vary in rarity and in such, value. You can trade with players, using orbs as your currency for item exchanges and websites like Poe.trade facilitate that. Allowing instantanious item searches to find that sword with all the right stats for the right price. You just message the owner ingame and trade your currency for the sword.   Co-op is easy, too. A simple party system will allow you to hop into the world of the party leader and experience the world together, back to back surrounded by angry skeletons. Loot system in the game is tied to indivual players which prevents theft if your in public parties. Options for free4all and round robin, too.   The game very much falls into the easy to learn, hard to master catagory. If your looking for diablo-like hack n slash, then this is at the top of the list. No other hack n slash, not even the 60$ Diablo 3 title, comes close to the depth of gameplay and competency of the endgame system.   10/10. Would buy. Why can't I buy?  Just buy yourself some stash tabs. Support this developer if you enjoy the game.      ",

I going to tell you the reason, why this game are worth your time.  First, don't look at my steam hours. It might look like I barely play this game under an hours, but truth to known; I am playing this game in Garena (SEA server) ever since it's beta release and the hours I spend probably are over 8,000. The game itself are fun, competitive and challenging while the developer GGG does not introduce any microtransaction that would neither break the game or turn it into pay to win (The very core factor why I am sticking to this game).  Second, the developer do listen to their player and try their best to fullfilled their request. You see, I quit this game for 1 and a half years due to the incompetency of Garena to handle POE for GGG developer. The server are always lag and they constantly replaced their staff GM with a much useless imbecile, one to the extend that the population of POE player in Garena server dwindle as they giving up playing it with most of them only aim to return when their voice are being heard.  One of the few are like me, who are soo ♥♥♥♥ off that even wrote a mail to GGG requesting them to take over and execute a server migration from Garena to Global server. I thought they do not take my initiative seriously, as their response indicate there is no guarantee it would be done anytime. But they do listen, because the migration begin after 18 months of wait. Does the wait worth it? Yes, it is.  Third, their customer service are fast and efficient. Maybe they are fast and efficient for me, maybe they are not for you. It is different for individual. From my experience, I experience an issues with server migration and send a e-mail; with reply and immediate action from GGG customer service within 24 hours. Something that I do not experience it with Garena customer service. If this does not encourage you to play it, nothing will.  Oh, in case my review does not mention anything about gameplay. I would just keep it short for you, the gameplay might not be friendly to casual player.",

            "review_text": "The game has been going in a new direction the last year and a bit, they've rapidly been gaining more concurrent players so I do not blame them for sticking to what they're currently doing.  Since the 2.0 patch (Ascendancy expansion) there has been a gradual power-creep. 2.0 introduced subclasses called ascendancies, these subclasses were incredibly powerful with no downside despite this massive buff we did not see any real retuning of monster health to compensate for this massive buff. 2.0 also buffed the drop chance of the rarest unique items in the game by 400% while many will disagree that this is a bad thing I believe it is as it lets people making insanely strong builds quicker and with less grinding involved. As the game grew new leagues brought in new ways to make currency, due to this the rate at which you gain currency has increased exponentially meaning you can make an incredibly strong character is much less time..  Over the next few months there was little to no nerfs despite the fact that the majority of the content was being trivialized. We then saw a massive buff to energy shield making the amount you could get much higher, Most people could hit 10000 ES without a huge investment, some going 12000+ This is an insane amount of health and further trivialized content.  I implore anyone who disagrees to check videos from two years ago vs today. Check Darkee's poison mines build that made the hardest content in the game at the time(Uber atziri) completely trivial. Also check mathil's current blade flurry guide. His tactic for defeating the new bosses(Breach lords) is to do so much damage quickly that they die before doing anything.   The game has become zip around with a movement skill one hit a pack of mobs loot and move on. Due to GGG catering to this clear-speed meta mob damage was buffed meaning if you play a slow non-meta build everything is insanely dangerous even white mobs. The best defense has become kill something but it can do anything. The only things that get nerfed are builds that a huge amount of people play, other things are rarely touched at all.   GGG is an amazing company who talk to the community a lot. It's nice to see the game grow so much and obviously this shift to a more casual tone has helped the game grow greatly, it's just not for everyone. If you're looking for difficult content you're going to have to go out of your way to find it.",
