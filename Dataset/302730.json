            "review_text": "Very good game set in a steampunk world where a princess must save her kingdom from the Iron Lord and his mechanical army. At the highest difficulty there aren't HO scenes but only minigames and puzzles, so it isn't technically a Hidden Object Game, but an Adventure game. The Premium Edition has also a bonus playable chapter and nice extras, there are achievements but only in-game. Absolutely recommended.",

            "review_text": "A lovely casual point-and-click adventure (*not* a hidden-object game). It's quite long and there's lots to do, including plenty of simple but satisfying mini-games. It's all quite easy, so make sure to play in advanced mode to at least give it a little bit of a challenge!  The story is dumb, but It's very pretty, and the engaging steampunk world is full of cute critters and robots, and ... terrible voice acting. I guess you can't win it all.  The negative reviews are silly! There are many people who enjoy casual adventure games. If you are such a person, you will love this one.  I'd also like to thank the developer for supporting Linux!",

I just wish it was made in higher resolution.  And the amount of animation in this game is so good, I've seen this no where in other point and click.",
