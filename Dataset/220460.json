            "review_text": "Players begin their career as a Cargo Commander in a perfectly square space station that functions as their home for the game's duration. The space station contains all the necessary tools for a successful career, including a computer for checking email and changing levels (known as sectors in the game), an upgrade bench for buying new equipment and upgrading the commander's armor and weapons, magnet control for attaching additional cargo containers for exploration, and even a coffee machine when in need of that extra boost of caffeine.  As players begin each day in space, they are given a defined number of loot items to gain and eventually a key that rewards access to additional sectors. If players die in the process of collecting the loot, they begin a new day and try again to acquire the specified loot. As cargo containers are brought crashing into the space station through use of the magnet, their exteriors are covered, requiring players to drill into them before seeing what treasure or trap is waiting inside. Once players enter inside a container, the 2D platforming aspect of the game takes control and tasks players with collecting loot items and dodging the attacks of enemies while fleeing for safety.  Each container houses loot items that vary in rarity and value in addition to hostile alien creatures that complicate the process. After a short time, the cargo containers start to break apart as a result of violent wormholes which require players to grab the loot and rush back to the space station before their supply of oxygen is depleted. The entire process of drilling into cargo containers, frantically searching for loot, battling violent alien creatures, and finally rushing back to the space station is both a thrilling and extremely-gratifying experience.  Loot and other forms of currency in the containers can, in turn, be spent on upgrades for the commander character that range from reinforced armor to extended oxygen while in space. The catch is that the upgrades are reset upon each day or after your character meets their fate, which creates a roguelike atmosphere of gameplay. As players advance in levels, which is determined by the amount and rarity of loot earned, they are rewarded with upgrade points that are replenished each day. More advanced upgrades include improvements to the space station, one of which is that it can auto-repair itself after losing walls from crashing containers.  Beyond collecting loot, players can travel to other sectors that are simply just different leaderboards based on their given names. The only interaction that players have online is the competition of leaderboard scores and the discovery of other dead commanders within containers. It's unfortunate that the game did not include an actual multiplayer component as cooperative loot collecting would have been an absolute blast. After awhile, the leveling system and loot collection become repetitive as the gameplay, never evolving beyond the core mechanics. Day after day, players continue with the same menial task as aliens become stronger and loot more difficult to acquire. Without convincing a couple of friends to compete for the highest score of loot collection, the platforming entertainment of Cargo Commander becomes more mundane than engaging.  The presentation of Cargo Commander shines in nearly all of its aspects, from the pixel-shaded visual appearance, or the outstanding sound effects, to the lack of any sound while floating about in space. The most impressive graphical element is the destructible environments of both the commander's space station and cargo containers. Either using his drill or planted explosives, it's a thrill to tear apart any surface that is between the commander and his hunger for more space loot. In regards to the game's sound, details like the volume of the station's radio music becoming dimmer as the player floats further into space is a brilliant touch. The only downside with the presentation is that the game's environments of cargo containers never vary that greatly and after awhile can become just as mundane as the gameplay.  The elements of a 2D platformer, space, zero-gravity, destructive environments, and loot collection combine for an experience that is both entertaining and addictive for the beginning hours. As additional levels are gained and higher scores earned, the gameplay experience never quite evolves beyond its initial premise. Players that have a group of friends for online leaderboard competition will undoubtedly discover more value with the end game. 2D platformer and space enthusiasts are sure to find something they'll enjoy in Cargo Commander, while those seeking a more varied game will have to look elsewhere among the stars.

            "review_text": "Cargo Commander caught me totally off-guard. I was expecting something more traditional, with set levels and power-ups and some goofy story. What I got was a deceptively clever roguelike that started eating hours of my time, at least once I got over some rough patches.  You play an employee of Cargo Corp, sent off to the ♥♥♥-end of space in a boxy little junker of a ship to salvage equally junky boxes. Your ship is equipped with a magnet that, when activated, draws in a random assortment of giant space containers to smash into your ship and each other. Within these containers are the random bits of space junk Cargo Corp wants, along with enemies, hazards, and weapons to handle them. Connected containers usually have gaps to pass through where they collide, forming a rudimentary platforming level, but you can also drill through walls or spacewalk (as long as you can hold your breath) to get where you want to go.  Surviving enough waves of salvage gets you a container with a sector pass, which lets you travel to another area of space with different containers and salvage. Sectors are random based on their name, and the navigation system shows you popular systems, unpopular systems, systems your friends play, random systems, and even let you enter your own name to create a new one. It's a neat bit of continuity between players, further bolstered by the player corpses you can find and loot in heavily-trafficked sectors, and postcards from other players you can find randomly, or fill out and shoot into space if you find a blank one.  As far as gameplay goes, that's it. You call in waves of containers, loot them for cargo and resources to upgrade your dude (which reset for each sector), and get back to your ship before the 'level' gets sucked back into space. There are basically two kinds of enemies in the game, melee monsters of varying size in the containers, and aggravating drill-squid things in space. You can find and upgrade a handful of weapons to deal with them, but combat is pretty thin and it's easy to get overwhelmed. The platforming isn't much better, with the random containers sometimes making regular exploring impossible and forcing you to drill out tons of walls or spacewalk around obnoxious areas.  With each sector essentially the same aside from items to find and container layouts, the game risks getting repetitive very quickly. I was about ready to punch out after 90 minutes or so... until I started paying attention to the story. Cargo Commander has a surprisingly dark, dystopian plot propping up the platforming, told through darkly funny emails from corporate and charming letters and packages from your family. As you tick off the the 88 different kinds of cargo to find, you rank up with the company, getting you new tools to speed up the process and maybe making progress towards getting home someday.  The whole package is far more compelling than I first thought, and I find myself returning to it whenever I have a free moment. The graphics are pretty basic indie 3D and the sound design works well enough, but it's the unique roguelike format married to an interesting world and story that keep it fresh. There are leaderboards for each sector and an endless mode to challenge if you need more variety, but even without those details Cargo Commander is worth digging into.",

Pros: Setting, Graphics, Music, Controls Cons: Gameplay  Cargo Commander creates a deep sense of loneliness in outer space. The visuals and sound only serve to enhance this feeling. Realists may use the 'silent space' option, but the ability to use your own music aboard the ship is outstanding. The controls are excellent, and they should be, for a relatively simple platform game.  Unfortunately, the gameplay matches too well the drudgery of space salvaging. Sectors may be randomly generated but offer little challenge. With over eighty cargo types and only six types per sector, the game is an exercise in patience rather than skill. Completionists will find themselves weary-eyed searching for ultra rare cargos.  Salvage the fun by playing in short sittings.  6/10",

            "review_text": "This is just a really solid game in general. At its core, Cargo Commander is a roguelike platformer of sorts, you spend your time exploring cargo crates for loot items and bringing them back to base while also trying not to get killed by enemies, but it has a lot of smart mechanics that keep the experience interesting.   For starters, each crate will only be available for a limited time before it gets sucked into space, and if you're still on it you'll have to fight your way back to base before you suffocate, which both creates a nice element of risk vs reward and also keeps the game moving at a good clip. The game's pacing is very good in general, you can get into a stage quickly and zip through the easy early waves (you can end a wave early if you've finished exploring it or don't want to risk getting killed) to get to the challenging content in record time. This is a great timekiller game in general because you can get a lot done in a short amount of time.  It's also an example of randomized content done well. The sectors are all generated randomly using words as a seed, but even after doing about a hundred of them it didn't feel repetitive, partially because the game moves so quickly. You might encounter a crate design you've seen before, but the focus is more on the larger goal of grabbing as much stuff as you can and getting back to base before time runs out, and you never know what to expect as each new wave hits. I also like that the sectors can actually be 'won' (both by surviving long enough to get the sector pass and the more difficult, optional task of surviving to the final wave), unlike most randomized games where you just play until you die, it makes the game feel a bit more rewarding.  There's even a little bit of story in here. It's very subtle and doesn't interrupt the game experience, but it's kind of touching nonetheless and it helps keep you going until you reach the end.",

Easily one of the most downbeat (dare I say 'grim'?) indie titles I've ever played, but it doesn't ever beat you over the head and it's entirely optional content. I honestly don't know if I'd continue the fool's errand of trying to collect all 88 cargo items if it wasn't for those little dribbles of a truly ♥♥♥♥ed up backdrop.  Also there's an endless mode you unlock a few 'days' into the game. So if progressing 'story' and score-attacking against friends in their own worlds isn't a thing for you, there's always the challenge of an eternal jaunt through ruined ships and horrible creatures for that one last Glow In The Dark Unicorn.",

Random words determine the shape and size and direction and contents of containers you have to deal with. The game is set in deep space, so outside each container is a gravity free environment where you can float for a limited time (oxygen-wise). As you attract containers to explore, you can get more points to boost your equipment for a limited period of time and get even stronger equipment.  The game rewards those who explore and take risks, and the worst that can happen is you can end up in a sector that is too difficult to complete and you end up there for a while. There are multiple ways to complete each level though, so the fact that you can take a different approach makes it a very replayable and fun game.",

I don't have much to say about this game. the grafix aren't bad nor good. the gravity is fun as hell and the upgrades are good, but you reset everything every time you die so it's not an RPG. More like a new spin on the old school platformer.",

And thanks to being a cartoony art style, even with minimum graphics, it still looks really good. Personally, I find it amazing how you can create your own sectors to challenge your friends or any random person who finds the same sector, along with having a very comedic item system. I mean, even finding the odd postcard now and then really makes me smile, the kind of things people write on them. You can send your own postcards and have another random player recieve it unless you specify a name. I'd gladly give this game a recomendation, seeing how it has cheered me up on many a-gloomy days! :D",
