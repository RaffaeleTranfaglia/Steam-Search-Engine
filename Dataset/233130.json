            "review_text": "Welcome, this is my first serious review and I hope you have fun reading it!   Shadow Warrior isn't what you would consider to be a reboot or a remake of an older title. The best term to consider it as would be to call it a 'Re-Imagining'. Everything in Shadow Warrior pays homage to the 1997 version, ranging from the deliberately cheesy humour to the bombastic and downright ridiculous arsenal of weapons.  This game is developed by 'Flying Wild Hog', whom of which are known for creating 'Hard Reset'.  You are Lo Wang a presumably mid thirties agent of Zilla enterprises, who is tasked with finding the fabled katana known only as the Nobitsura Kage. However as one may expect, things do not go to plan. You are immediately introduced to the smooth, fast and visceral combat in the form of the katana. The hit registration feels perfect as you begin slicing your way through hordes of foes. I won't say much about the story anymore, with the exception of the fact that you are quickly introduced to a magical being who gives you awesome flashing abilities.  The special powers you recieve allow for some stylish ways to decapitate your enemies, whether it be by flinging a blade of energy at their pathetic head or whether you prefer to do a 360 degree spin to destroy multiple enemies at once. The sword play feels so great and as a result you'll be spending most of your time using the katana whilst also trying to achieve the best possible score in a segment of each level.   The gunplay however, starts of relatively weak due to the lack weight when firing certain types of weapons. This is especailly prevalent in the revolver because of the lackluster sound and uninspired concept. But as the game drip feeds you more and more weapons, the more and more awesome they become. Thanks to weapon upgrading system, you can add absurd alternate firing modes to certain weapons. Ever wanted to launch all of your rocket launcher ammo at once? Well now you can!  The game for the most part looks absolutely beautiful, and I believe that is due to the vibrant colour palette that the developers decided to use. The textures looks high res and the lighting effects can cause you to lose yourself in the environment. My only concern in terms of the graphics is that they tend to over-use warm colours a lot, and that can cause some difficulty in navigating your way around the level due to the objective flashing orange.  Speaking of levels... The level design is for the most part average, the segments of the level don't feel like they connect together to form one cohesive environment. Instead it feels like a mish mash of rooms filled with enemies to fight with the occassional area that branches out and allows you to explore. Despite the well thought out concepts and aesthetics, the levels are generally not very interesting.  Now to my final gripe, the boss battles. They essentially feel like a larger more powerful version of the games beefier enemies that take a substantially longer time to kill. These battles aren't all that engaging to participate in as they feel repetitive and downright boring. The boss battles goes as follows. Wear down boss-&gt; Shoot Important Part-&gt; Wear down Boss-&gt; Rinse and repeat.  Do I think that this game is worth a purchase? Heck yes, this game puts AAA first person release titles to shame! The combat is absolutely amazing and I never tired of it (With the exception of the boss battles) and there's enough snarky and crude humour to please everybody. So, if you enjoy good FPS games with a fantastic feel of badass, Shadow Warrior is definitely one to pick up.  Feedback and criticism is welcome!",

Feeling like a knight and slashing my plastic sword left and right to kill hordes of imaginary orcs around me and so on... Then I grow up and I discovered that Japanese people exist! And with the Japanese the katana! That sword...absolutely beautiful and incredible. And here in this game is the most powerful weapon ever....even than the BFG9000 that you can find in DooM! Yeah ok you have a cool pistol that will make you feel like in the old far west... Yeah you have a flamethrower that will make the monsters scream and run all over the place like boiled chickens... Yeah you will even have a rocket launcher that you can use to paint 'modern art' on the walls with the pieces of the monsters... AND YEAH OBVIOUSLY you can even cut off the head of one of the monsters and use it like a laser gun....shot by its eyes....you know like Cyclops or Superman... What other game don't have this  stuff...uh?  But that katana...so shining, so pointy, so powerful, so awesome....aaaahh an ♥♥♥♥♥♥!  Anyway what I think of this game?...this game is magnificent...from the old Shadow Warrior this is a very well made remake/reboot of the original one. Lot of action, few jokes around found inside the cookies or between you and your companion (yes you will have a companion with you for almost the whole game) and an absolute brilliant graphic. Games of light, shadow and smoke will give you shivers in some situations.  Even the plot is well made with several cutscenes (with manga like draws or with the in game graphic)...but still...is Shadow Warrior...there is no time to talk...in fact some parts are pretty challenging and you will sweat on your mouse and keyboard to keep up.  This game will engage you so much that...well...it will make you happy, it will make you angry, it will make you satisfied and it will make you sad too...  Enjoy this wonderful game in every part of it.  Overall: Graphic 9/10 Sounds 8/10 Gameplay 8/10 Longevity 8/10",

            "review_text": "Shadow Warrior is one of the best FPS games that I've ever played in my life! You take control over Lo Wang, a cocky guy who has to do some exchange for his boss. Things are going sour, you're getting ambushed and you end up teaming up with equally cocky demon (sic!). That's the beginning of really interesting story that I'm not going to spoil here.  Let's just say that your first (and main) weapon is a katana. And boy, did they make this weapon enjoyable to use :) You also have guns. Lots of guns. Machine gun, flamethrower, crossbow, ninja stars, freaking disembodied demon's head... And you can hold all of them, which is rare for games released nowadays.  You also have 3 types of upgrades (and 3 'currencies' so to speak to use for said upgrades). Weapon enchancements, powers and skills. You can unlock special attacks, healing boost, defensive moves, special powerful katana attacks, variety is stunning.  The game encourages exploration. There are a lot of secrets scattered through the game there's also few easter eggs (for example: if you disturb two bunnies which have intimate moment together, you'll wake up a rabbit demon which will attack you in metal music accompaniment :P)  Controls are nice and responsive. Your special moves are done by pressing certain combination of buttons. It's fluent and simple. You also have dash move, which comes in handy suprisingly often.   Graphics and aesthetic are great.  Enemies are crazy and satisfying to kill. There are also 3 big boss battles, and I mean big. Like you are fighting an enemy who's like 50 meters high :P  I have only two pet peeves with this game:  First - at a certain point you can clearly see the 'ambush' sort of gameplay that they tried to use. Like you find some important object and bam, it's an ambush, enemies swarming you left and right. It's not Call of Duty bad, where if you don't move the enemies will respawn infinetely (well, disregard :P they will until you kill the spawner :P). Nah, it's obvious what they tried to do. It's not horrible, but pretty transparent and somewhat annoying at times. Good that killing enemies is so fun :P  Second - there's no map. The game is quite linear, but there are still some parts of the game where I just got lost and didn't know what to do next (usually it had something to do with finding a certain spot to plant explosives or press a button on the wall somwhere)  All in all - Shadow Warrior is really great game and it saddens me that crap like Call of Duty sells millions of copies and enjoyable gems like Shadow Warrior are neglected.  9/10!",

            "review_text": "I don't recall the last time I've ever had so much fun on an SP only game. I want to start this review off by saying that the developers released a patch for the game to use DirectX11 and better support for 64-bit systems, about two years after it's release. These guys deserve your money.  Now, like many fans of the old Shadow Warrior, I was a little worried because I heard about all the changes from the gameplay to Wang's character himself, but the game still does have some 'old-school' elements. While the levels are much more linear than the original, exploring and going off trail is still worth it as there are many secrets to be found and the gameplay is still very fast, intense and immersive. You can still find hentai chicks bathing themselves and singing, and even find secrets taking you back to levels from the old-school Shadow Warrior.  You're gonna use that katana a LOT. It's just so damn fun to use! Throughout the game, you'll be upgrading your katana and learning new attacks for it which will keep the sword feeling fresh. If you want to try out something new, in the pause menu you can change what kind of Katana you can use, including some laser/lightsaber thing and even the Excalibat from Rise of the Triad!  The guns are a lot of fun to use as well and you'll be upgrading those too. It has some of the same weapons from the original, such as the demon heart, demon head, rocket launcher (which freakin' kicks ♥♥♥ in this game), Uzi's (and dual wielding of course), a tearing-♥♥♥ shotgun (which gets a 4-shot chamber just like the original) as well as some added ones like a sexy and powerful Revolver, a big crossbow that can be upgraded to detonate explosions at will, and more.  Aside from weapons, you can also upgrade Wang himself and gain some other special powers that you will find out for yourself.  And obviously, there's Lo Wang. Duke Nukem's bother from another mother. I don't think this was intended, but I like to think of this as Lo Wang when he was younger and how he became so wise and powerful. The way he shaves his head and gets tattoos later on in the game makes him look like the classic Wang we know, so that was pretty sweet too. Lo Wang is still an ♥♥♥ (he even claims to be in the game) and he's still full of awesome one-liners that you'll want to remember and use on people later on in real life because it's cliche. His voice acting is just great, from the cutscenes, to his trash-talking enemies, to his occasional scream from swinging the Katana so hard, to his screams and cursing when taking damage. It makes you feel like you're Wang almost.   Oh yeah, the cutscenes. I'm never a fan of cutscenes, or even stories in video games in general, but I did not skip a single cutscene in this game. The story is solid and will suck you in! (the cutscenes are skippable if you don't want to watch them.) Lastly, the graphics in this game may be the best I've seen yet. The normals, bumpmaps and lighting in this game is insane, very impressed on how it keeps the framerate so fluid especially with hordes of enemies attacking you in these overwhelmingly beautiful worlds.  There's so much I want to say, but so much that I don't want to spoil for you. You must try this game for yourself. If it means waiting for a sale, fine - but this game is worth more than it's usual $9.99 when it's 75% off (which is usually the discount it has). So if you want a modernized throwback of one of your favorite old-school games, grab this, you won't be disappointed. If you want a throwback to an old-school game that still keeps the old-school non-linear fast gameplay but with modern and pretty graphics, then grab Rise of the Triad. Wang is there too!",

            "review_text": "In 1997, Shadow Warrior released for PC as a spiritual successor to Duke Nukem 3D, and starred a terribly racist Asian caricature named Lo Wang. This isn’t a premise that sounds like it would be able to endure nearly twenty years later, and yet developer Flying Wild Hog revived Shadow Warrior last year on the PC, which has now made its way to the Xbox One and PS4. Lo Wang’s return is a successful one, with all of the purposely-offensive humor and over-the-top gameplay you’d expect from it.  Amazingly, Shadow Warrior’s plot is not to be overlooked, as it is engaging and becomes more serious and grounded as the game goes on. This is tempered by the silly combat and hilarious dialogue throughout the game. The player takes on the role of Lo Wang, a gun-toting, sword-wielding, ninja mercenary working for the mysterious Orochi Zilla, a powerful Japanese businessman. What starts off as a routine mafia transaction quickly spirals out of control into a demon-filled murderfest wherein Lo Wang uses his last name to reference his ♥♥♥♥ on a regular basis. Accompanying Wang is the smart-mouthed demon Hoji, who serves as Lo Wang’s guide through the world of pseudo-Japanese culture and mysticism. The plot works perfectly with the insane gameplay and general silliness that Shadow Warrior provides.  The combat in Shadow Warrior can be described as fast, bloody, and insane. The player is given ninja stars, a samurai sword, and a lot of guns to blast through hordes of ninjas, police officers and demons in one of the messiest first-person hack-and-slash experiences I’ve ever played. The guns can be a little difficult to use, as the aiming system can be a little unwieldy and some guns feel underpowered, but the swordplay is a lot of fun and is intended to be Wang’s tool of destruction for the majority of the time.  Lo Wang also gains magical abilities to aid him, which include healing spells and telekinetic push abilities. My personal favorite is an ability that allows Wang to spin in a whirlwind attack that decapitates everyone around him. These abilities help to round out the combat and give players a multitude of ways to go about any given combat scenario, although I was mostly content just slashing enemies to bits.  Lo Wang has many upgrade opportunities at his disposal as well, which are cleverly broken into different categories that can be upgraded by different means. Karma, for example, will allow the player to purchase certain modifiers, while money allows the player to upgrade their equipment. The options for how the player can evolve and upgrade Wang are pretty vast, meaning that the each person can upgrade according to their play style. I like to run in swinging a sword, so I need to be able to take a lot of damage, so I upgraded healing spells, damage resistant perks, and maximum health modifiers. This upgrade system can be a little complicated, but is well-worth taking the time to learn, as it’ll make Lo Wang an even bigger badass according to each player’s personal style.  Shadow Warrior looks great on the Xbox One, for the most part. Slicing a demon into multiple pieces has never felt more rewarding, but some elements, like human characters are low-res and a bit fuzzy. The sound, however, is great. The music is fast-paced and has an Eastern flair to it, and the sound effects are top-notch. The voice acting is also surprisingly good, especially from Wang’s sidekick Hoji who helps out with a lot of the exposition and banter.  The combat is awesome, the dialogue is hilarious, and the excessive gore is a guilty pleasure that never gets old. Shadow Warrior is one of those games that reminds us that gaming, at its core, should be fun, and it delivers fun times in a big way.",

You can tell that time was really taken to make each weapon really nice looking. -Great Gore, and damage location recognition/reactions from the AI: Shoot em in the arm, and they stagger and hold their arm in pain, shoot em in the leg, and they fall and then drag the bloody stump behind them. Slice at the head for decaps, or go low and take out their movement. Shielded Demons require quick reflexes and waiting for the right moment to strike or a hell of a lot of fire power. -The graphics are amazing, I run it at 4K at 60fps with no drops, and Ultra settings. Its a beautiful thing. -I love the Weapons upgrade system, and the RPG Character Growth which for a NINJA based FPS is pretty great. -A Character Upgrade System thats actually useful, with skills that make or break your ability to survive in battle. -I am playing on Normal and its still challenging at times and you will die if your not careful. (Yes really) -Awesome Powers and Skills which allow you to customize your character and play, dare I say 'strategically.' -A pretty good story... Actually really good for a FPS... Way better than no Story..( I'm looking at you DOOM 2016) -Using the Katana and Shuriken feels natural with the mouse and Keyboard. -NO Crashes, not a single one.

            "review_text": "This is an excellent revision of an old, dated and rather socially awkward game. In many ways, Shadow Warrior seems to have learned all of the lessons from the failed Duke Nukem Forever in updating a classic game for a new audience. For one thing, Shadow Warrior takes everything that was great about the original, like the over the top violence, large sprawling level design, hitting things with swords and drops the things that were rather not good: Like the blatant racism. There are still plenty of puns and other ridiculous jokes, after all the protagonist is still called 'Lo Wang' but it's clearly laughing with the protagonist - not at him because of his race.   By far the greatest thing about Shadow Warrior is the intuitive, fun to use and well implemented sword plus magic system. While there ARE guns in Shadow Warrior, I kept consistently forgetting they existed by hacking demons apart with magic and the sword was just incredible fun. The sword strikes depending on how you're moving, allowing you to very precisely dismember various demons, police or yakuza once you become skilled with it. Add to that a series of magical ki abilities for your sword, plus magic spells that let you heal, stun enemies, float them in the air and so forth. This adds a tremendous amount of depth and strategy to the games combat, which is so much fun to use I - as mentioned - forgot there was actually firearms in the game. I easily just got through 90% of the game using only the sword and various ki abilities.  This isn't to imply the guns are bad in any way, because there are numerous upgrades available to make them more effective, gain interesting secondary firing modes and so forth. I just found the sword so much fun to use and so effective, that I never felt the need to use the guns outside of a handful of specific sections where they are useful. Unfortunately, this might also be a comment on the general lack of enemy variety present in Shadow Warrior. There aren't a lot of enemy types in the game, so you will be facing the same combinations of demons and mini-boss demons a lot. This is especially vexing, because while there are armed human enemies in corrupt police and yakuza, they aren't used very frequently in the game at all. Minding, there is one particular section near the end, where it throws a huge amount of ordinary human fellows at you while you have a fully powered up sword. That was quite satisfying, especially after some of the difficult previous encounters.  What I found interesting was that while the gameplay is fantastic, what surprised me and pulled me through the game in the end was the extremely well crafted story. Lo Wang has an actual character arc, with proper growth and some really great dialog with his demonic companion Hoji. There is actually a pretty compelling plot underneath all of the hacking people away with Katanas, with some great and genuinely emotive moments towards the end especially. It's especially rewarding getting some artistic cutscenes after finishing each of the long chapters, then facing off against some particularly well designed and fun to fight bosses (none of which felt frustrating, which is a genuine compliment).   Overall this is a great update to an old game, which is also packed with great secrets (including sections designed to look like the original Shadow Warrior). Definitely recommend, especially if you like first person melee combat in a game.",

It also shares much of the mechanics and gameplay tropes of the earlier game, and that’s all to the good as well. It differs from Hard Reset in some areas, however, most notably with the variety of weapons and the more conventional upgrade system and skills tree. There’s also a stronger story, although it is a tad incoherent at times. There are some very cool cutscenes, but they’re used sparsely and never intrude but do help to flesh out the story. And there’s also plenty of amusing, deliberately cheesy, dialogue to enjoy. Graphically, SW is one of the most stunning games I’ve come across, and it also delivers some impressive physics. It’s not open world, as is de rigueur these days, but its linearity keeps the story, and the game progression, on the rails and never detracts from the fun. Hugely enjoyable and highly recommended. 4/5",

My first play thorough was on insane which was an insane idea but got to the finish in the end. The only thing missing in this game as yet for me is a co-op play thorough as that would be insane fun. Also has 3 maps for survival which you can play from easy to insane mode.",

            "review_text": "8.5/10 Overview: First Person Melee/Shooter  The Good:  + Graphics- both on an artistic and technical level everything looks fantastic. Every environment spread across 17 levels feels distinct. The only downside is the developers went heavy with the bloom lighting.  + Combat is fun and satisfying. The game gives you a variety of different weapons at your disposal. The katana, your main weapon is usually your go to weapon when things start to go bad. It slices and dices enemies to bits. You also have guns that are slowly acquired through the game. The first half of the game seems to be more reliant on your katana and when the larger enemies show up is when your guns start to become more useful. You also have a variety of spells and sword techniques that can give you the upper hand in combat. No matter how you choose to dismember your enemies, you will always have a good time.  + The game features a very robust upgrade system. Money is used to upgrade your weapons. Each weapon has 3 upgrades. Ki crystals are used to upgrade your spells. Each spell has 4 upgrades. Lastly as you defeat your enemies you gain experience which is used to upgrade your passive abilities and sword techniques.   + Secrets are scattered throughout every level, some secrets are a throwback to the original game  + The story starts off very weak however the more it starts to reveal itself the more interesting it gets. The story is told through comic book style cut scenes that look beautiful. Throughout the game you are accompanied by a demon named Hoji who at first is really annoying but starts to grow on you.   + The game is very polished. Even with all the explosions and all the effects happening my game barely dropped below 60fps.   + New Game plus to start the game over with all your upgrades and weapons.   The Average:  You have the ability to dash forward. If you dash on top of a steep staircase you will die. This gets really frustrating as you will be dashing all the time and this will probably be the cause of a lot of needless deaths. The developers said this bug/'Feature' cannot be fixed.  As much fun as the game is, it starts to wear itself out in the last few levels. Once you've seen all the enemies and upgraded all that you need, fighting the same hordes of enemies over and over again starts getting boring. Luckily the game ends before it really becomes a bigger issue.   This is one of those rare first person shooters where playing with a controller is preferable. The reason being is that you have to input directional inputs to cast your spells and I found it easier to do with a controller than a K/M. In addition the game relies more heavily on melee combat than guns so precise aiming is never really a concern.   Some of the later levels can get a bit confusing.   I felt the last boss was underwhelming. I guess I was expecting something more.    Conclusion  This game is a remake of an old school FPS however this is not an old school fps. Levels are mostly linear with only one way to progress while throwing large amounts of enemies at you for you to dispose. If you enjoy fighting large groups of enemies while you level up your abilities than you will have a good time with the game. Overall this is definitely worth checking out and a very underrated game that deserves a bit more attention. ",

But I will try to say something about the new version. You can see similar arrangement as in HR. Sprint, fight,bosses and different functions weapons. However, in my opinion, HR is a better game from Flying Wild Hog. But let's get to the meat. The graphics are good but uneven. Picturesque locations delight the eye and not once can admire the work of graphic designers. But up close the graphics are not so great. No less is fine. I don't play on highest graphics settings. Gameplay is good and fight with katana is very good. To bring a special need such a blow, press 2x W and LMB. When it is mastered can make fun. However, a larger number of different enemies will be easier to use other weapons. At least to me it was easier. Weapons are many but some are not very effective and the feeling of shooting in some of the less impressive. Unfortunately, sometimes the game is frustrating. For me it was for this that some of the levels and enemies were poorly designed. Level of exploding enemies is terribly weak. A fight with the boss very easy and unsatisfying. The music is atmospheric and the sounds of enemies and weapons are at a good level. The game is not really in my style (kung fu) but I have fun. The story and the main character are fine although his statements are not as funny as Serious Sam or Duke Nukem. Sometimes they are childish and not funny. The game has a lot of easter eggs and funny moments like Fortune cookies. Some jokes can be understood only did the Poles because the Polish game studio. But it should not be a big problem for other players. The game also has a survival mode but only single so it's a big minus, and does not have a multiplayer mode. In summary. The game is good and I recommend you buy it at some sales. Graphics 8/10 Audio 8+/10 Gameplay 8+/10 Final verdict 7+/10.",

The environment is full of things that go boom (ala Hard Reset). The level design is fine; it is generally easy enough to figure out where to go while still leaving one plenty of room to explore. There were two locations where I gave up and checked a walkthrough to find some button / elevator whose small glow I had overlooked for a while.  There is an over-reliance on monster closets, but destroying wave after wave of enemies is saved from being a chore by the absolute glee of carving through them with a variety of interesting weapons (foremost being the katana). Occasional greater enemies provide more of a challenge and force one to juggle weapons abilities and powers. The boss fights are also reminiscent of Hard Reset, and didn't end up being too frustrating.  I'd love to see a Duke Nukem reboot from these guys, something more modest and just plain shooty than DNF.

But there needs to be something, so I'll try to be informative now: + Graphics are amazing. Every location looks stylish and has a lot of details. + Combat feel awesome. It has the good old-school feeling to it. Whether you wield a katana to chop some meat to bloody pieces or just like to shoot baddies from far - it all will feel very intense and satisfying. I really like the presence of alternative modes for shooting weapons. It's something that I missed in shooters long time (screw you, 'Press RMB to aim'! Hail to the 'Press RMB to kick ♥♥♥!'). + You have 4 magic abilities and 4 sword powers. Those are activated by tapping the movement key twice and pressing LMB or RMB (you can use magic while wielding shooting weapons too). If it doesn't work well for you, you can make timing adjusments in settings, which is nice. + Enemies are well varied and have their own strengths and weaknesses. If you use your magic abilities too much, they will become more and more enraged and will attack more swiftly and painfully. + The plot is surprisingly good. The dialogues are well-written and characters are likeable. There's a lot of funny lines. + Secrets! Lots of secrets and easter eggs! Something that I've missed a lot too! + My personal favorite - a lot of interactive, destructable, physical objects (comma before 'physical' is intentional). In latest games I literally HATED the lack of physics, most objects being static pieces of environment (even in action games! that's absurd!). In this game, however, you can let your inner redneck out and smash vases, break tables, ruin the furniture, etc. A decent room may become a total mess after a good fight... or after some fooling around. I loooooove to break stuff.  There are also some downsides though, but nothing big: - Bosses are very similar in terms of fighting them. You just need to shoot the shiny parts of their armor and then destroy the uncovered crystals. Normal enemies make more challenge at some points. - A lot of using the 'This door is magically sealed! Go destroy 3 statues that are holding the seal!' method. It gives some depth to levels and makes them more varied-less linear (because you have to go search for those statues), but to the game's end it become quite annoying. - Players with not powerful enough computers may experience sluggishness and low framerate. I've made it through the whole game on max settings and never had a problem (and my system is not a high-end one), but I saw people complaining on forums, so I think this should be stated here. But you know, people always complain. If your system is good, the game should run just fine.  That's all, I guess. I adore this game. An intense, fun, sort of nostalgic experience. If you love lots of blood and gore, if you like good humor, if your eyes are used to nice graphics, if you miss the good old days when shooters were clever and challenging - this game brings it all.",

Most of the guns are not immediately wonderful but if you invest in their upgrades nearly all of them BECOME wonderful.

Purchase the dual-wielding option for the mini submachine gun. Buildup your character (Lo Wang) as the game progresses. Gather money for weapons upgrades, Ki crystals for powers, and karma points for skills. Although the game has lots of light banter, the underlying story is rich and serious indeed, if a bit confusing. This was a surprising and pleasing discovery. It helped motivate me thorough what begins to be a grind of arena battles, of which there are many, many.  Bosses are enormous giants. Boss fights are doable and not too hard. Just remember to heal yourself frequently, circle to pick up powerups and shoot for the weak points when they appear. The “powers” must be invoked by keyboard/mouse combos. This can be a bit of a problem because it takes a bit of doing to remember them and invoke them when you need them most – during a battle.  Map landscapes and architecture are very detailed and often beautifully done. Shadow world maps are sparse. Game was rock solid – stable movement throughout, no crashes or glitches, never got stuck, frequent checkpoints.

I have many, many fond memories of that/those games. So when I first heard that they were rebooting it, I was a little hesitant. However, then I heard that Flying Wild Hogs was at the helm and I felt a little better. However, I also was worried that the racial &amp; sexist stuff (which in many ways made the original what it was) would not be present due to the climate of today’s society... and quite frankly, rightfully so. Many of those racial things in the original were extreme and highly racist &amp; sexist, so they really have no place in a modern intelligent game. Anyway, I am pleased to say that they did away with the racist stuff and improved on almost every aspect of the Shadow Warrior universe. The combat and controls are tight. The guns are amazing. The enemies are relentless. The core mechanics are awesome. But at the forefront is the swordplay. The Katana is no longer just a melee weapon that you use when you run out of bullets. It is the star of the show. I would argue that it is second main character of the whole game. If you liked hard reset, you will love this game. If you like Japanese culture, you will love this game.

Its one of my personal favorites and just has a unique setting of a game. Great single-player experience and has very remarkable asian world/mythical settings. You fight countless demons from the Shadow Realm and it becomes a very challenging game. Its a worthy title to have in your Steam Collection and it just works. The only flaws it has is the ending, and the overall backstory makes no sense...but that does not matter. A suitcase of money, a blooy sword and fighting endless demons is more than enough to deem worthy of being called Mr. Two Million Dollars. A'oh!    [PROS]    Visually Stunning &amp; Bloody Brilliant.    Authentic Asian-style action &amp; musical elements to the surroundings.    Samurai-Style Sushi (Everybody was kung fu fighing! ~)    Did I mention the blood and guts?    You are reading this now and should be playing it instead.

The main gameplay mechanic is the swordfighting, which is incredibly satisfying and enjoyable. The shooting is fun as well, and the game mixes up enemy types in a way where it encourages variety. Considering these developers have worked on games like Hard Reset and Painkiller, it's not surprising that the game throws tons of enemies at you at any given minute and keeps up a breakneck pace.  However, the problem is that the game is 4 hours too long. It gets to a point where the game runs out of enemy types, and every encounter feels the same. In addition, a decent amount of the later levels involve a lot of backtracking that feels incredibly unnecessary, like the developers wanted to make a longer game for some reason but didn't have the time or budget to do so. It got to the point where most encounters just felt like a slog and I just wanted to get it over with. If this game were 7 or 8 hours long instead of 12, the pacing wouldn't have felt nearly as sloppy.  So, having said that, I would recommend this game when it's on sale (I got it for $10), because it CAN be a lot of fun and the developers seem like really cool dudes who care about their fans, but be warned that it really loses steam in the last third of the game.",

The last few chapters become incredibly drudging however. In one section you're forced to fight two very fast and very strong minibosses at once with a vision handicap, and then they do it again in the next chapter, and AGAIN in the chapter after that. Some parts can feel very cheap and some of the mechanics as well. I found myself constantly using the Wing of Crane move because it was so damn good, but I rarely ever used the Flux or Shockwave skills. Some of the guns are fantastically good like the crossbow, but others are absolute garbage like the pistol.

The heavy melee focus sets it apart from similar games like Serious Sam or the Painkiller series, while you try to keep your distance from enemies in most shooters, here you will seek close contact much more often.   The levels are large and despite there being only one linear path to actually progress, there is always lots of secrets and pick-ups hidden in dark corners. Some might complain, that the lack of a mini-map or any kind of quest-marker makes it hard to know where to go sometimes, even when losing your way chances are high that you find at least something helpful or funny along the way.  Fun is something the game emphasizes a lot, the story is light, but the dialogs present range from cheeky to hilarious. There are three main settings, and the graphics are still great, especially the lighting is impressive throughout. Some bad textures and a couple of boring industrial areas in the second act dimish the overall good visual impression.  The only real downside to the game is the lack of enemy variety, since Shadow Warrior follows in Painkiller and Serious Sam’s footsteps of offering large scale battles and seemingly endless waves of enemies, there should be more enemy types to mix things up a bit better. As a result it is recommended to play this game not in long sessions but one or two levels a day. This way it keeps fresh and entertaining.  Pro: - fantastic swordplay - good variety of useful guns - Full of pop-culture jokes - solid upgrade system - beautiful lighting and settings  Cons: - not enough enemy variety - some boring levels - easy to get lost in the larger levels",

Through the game you learn abilities and skills that allow you to create combos and fight your own way. You have different types of enemies and bosses, so you also need to use your head in combat. Secret levels can be found and they are probably more exciting if you played the old original game which I didn't unfortunately. The plot is a little weird, but ok.

I eventually did get around to playing it - within the first five minutes, I was completely hooked, and this quickly became one of my favorite shooters.  Shadow Warrior is a story-oriented, first-person shooter in which you play Lo Wang, a corporate enforcer. The game begins as Wang is tasked with completing a straightforward purchase of an antique katana. Wang immediately sets the tone for the game by making cracks about the seller's henchmen and the cliché nature of the cherry-blossoms-plus-koi-ponds setting.  The combat system for the game is crisp and refreshing. Not only does Wang acquire a standard complement of FPS weapons as he progresses, he's also armed with shurikens and a katana. Via a pair of skill trees, one based on 'karma' ( XP ) and the other based on 'Ki crystals' that the player can occasionally locate, Wang can learn special combinations ( e.g. forward-forward-attack ) that allow him to supercharge his katana attacks, immobilize nearby enemies, or even partially heal himself. These combos add a dimension of depth and challenge to combat that helps to keep it interesting and intense throughout the game.  The level design is elegant and well-thought-out, directing the player without making her feel boxed-in and giving her the freedom to explore while still making it clear how to progress. The player is often forced to double back or cross her earlier path, but there's never that feeling of having to trudge back and forth across an area, and there are often new surprises waiting in areas that have been previously visited.  The story is engaging but not heavy-handed. It's there to provide context for events and motivation to the player and the character, but the focus is definitely on the action - control isn't ripped away from the player every thirty seconds to show a cutscene or an on-rails sequence. The game is filled with comedic moments, and there's a steady stream of genuinely witty ( not just 'video game' witty ) commentary from Wang that kept a grin on my face as I blasted and slashed.  The Linux port was very well done. I played from beginning to end on Ubuntu 15.04, and the game runs flawlessly on my aging Macbook Pro. It took me about 19 hours to complete the game on normal difficulty, with a moderate amount of exploration and a few retried battles.  If you like old-school action shooters, Shadow Warrior should be at the top of your to-play list!  I nominated this for the 'Whoooaaaaaaa, Dude!' Steam Award 2016.",

It's fun-ness comes primarily from the responsive, fast-paced, empowering gameplay. You quickly discover, right from the start of the game, how powerful all of your attacks are against the scores of enemies you encounter (unlike other action games where enemies just soak up damage). Also, the way the sword works is very satisfying - I can't think of a more fun implementation of first-person melee combat. Combined with the cool powers, it makes for a very over-the-top, violent, but pleasantly challenging game.   Also, you would normally expect an action game to skimp on the writing, voice acting, and overall story, but this game provides humorous and ocasionally thoughtful writing and voice work and presents an interesting and unique story.  I definitely recommend this if you know you like action / FPS games. It's kind of a hybrid because you can use a sword and guns, but you'll probably end up enjoying it if you like either.",

The graphics where actually really good, but then again, I'm quite easy with visuals in games The game play as on the gunzblazing and slice and dice was really well done in my eyes. had tons of fun with the difference in weapons, and of course you eventually have your favorite weapons :)  The story line surprised me the most... whooaa the actual length of this game, was way more then I would have ever thought!

            "review_text": "Having played the original Shadow Warrior nearly some twenty years ago (damn, I just made myself feel old), I can say that I was both looking forward to and kinda fearing a series reboot since they tend to go one of two ways: an improvement or a waste of time. And I'm happy to say, this reboot was a MAJOR improvement in every way.  Shadow Warrior kept to its defining roots; you play as Lo Wang and you fight demons with an assortment of fun weapons while cracking jokes, including poking fun at the original when you come across secret areas using the old, old, old graphics.  For me, story is what made this a top-rated FPS (maybe my favourite). An interwoven tale of gods and demons with practical and emotionally-driven decisions provides motivation far beyond 'they're bad for the sake of being bad, so I should go shoot them'. And the buddy-cop relation Lo Wang shares with Hoji kept me laughing and, better yet, uncertain how things would end.  Graphically, they didn't go for the super-duper-high-end which is always fine with me, but it's still pretty good and the enemeis and scenery were nicely varied (gotta love them coy ponds and cherry trees). The audio was decent with a soundtrack I found worth the special edition upgrade. Game-play harkens back to the old-school FPS of (eventually) packing 10guns at all times and secret areas everywhere but also adds in a few puzzles and an upgrade system for the weapons, your skills, and your magic so you can fight your way.  So even if you don't have a connection to the original Shadow Warrior, this is a great game for anyone who is a fan of story-based shooters. Also, here's hoping Strife and CyberMage receive similar treatment some day.",

            "review_text": "Shadow Warrior:  Positives:  + The game features lots of guns, including uzi's, revolvers, crossbows, shotguns, flamethrowers and more. There's plenty of weapon upgrades which add everything from dual wielding to explosive rounds for your firearms. In addition, two skill trees are available which focus on improving your healing abilities, movement, luck, katana mastery and defensive and offensive Chi powers, such as knockdown stuns and damage reduction blocking. There's a great amount of variation here for character building. + Very engaging combat for the most part, keeping you on your toes. There's several different types of enemies - standard demons, warlords, shamans, berserkers, flying demons plus others. + Hidden secrets to find for those who enjoy a bit of exploration, along with the often amusing fortune cookies. + Graphics are absolutely fine considering the obvious low budget for the game. It's clear Shadow Warrior is not a triple A game so stunning visuals shouldn't be expected. It's decent and that's all it needs to be. + The game takes a good 15-20 hours to finish, which is not too bad for an FPS, hack 'n' slash style title.   Negatives:  - Weak story, limited dialogue, somewhat hard to follow. Very linear for the most part. - Some non-sensical environmental mechanics, cars explodes by throwing shurikens at them, or a few bullets. Fighting is very arcade-like and lacks realism. - Really tedious and boring boss encounters, which can take 20-30 minutes per battle (hard difficulty). Often they're not that hard, just time consuming and annoying.   Overall Score: 7/10  Shadow Warrior is a nice, action packed game to pass the time. It has an acceptable amount of content for a cheap price (especially on sale) so it's well worth it.",

There is also a NG+ option. - Weapons are fun and upgrades enhance and transform the way they can be used - Runs really well - Some environments look great   Cons:  - Enemies repeat alot - there are about 6 or so main enemy types that get used throughout the whole game. You've seen pretty much every enemy by the 2/3 though mark and those enemies get thrown at you throughout the entire game.  Towards the end they just take a bunch of the hardest enemies and put them in the arenas together and repeat them in waves so fights can end up feeling the same.  - Maybe its just me but the constant arena after arena style of gameplay caused some pacing issues for me. You'll get out of a massive multi-wave fight and then you'll be in another one not very long after.  - Finding keys and destroying colour coded shrines to open doors isn't really my bag - but alot aren't really hidden so you don't need effort to find them - so why have the plater search for them at all?  - Bosses are few and far between and can be underwhelming. You basically shoot the weakpoint then shoot the weakppoint underneath the weakpoint.",

And the plot takes a surprising turn near the end. But in the grand scheme of it all these are minor gripes.  Where the game truly shines is in the combat. Not quite Serious Sam level, but still more than enough to keep things tense and exciting. The environments have some nice touches, and although the secrets aren't necessarily well hidden, it's more than enough for anyone who wants to take the time to look for them. Unlike other franchises that have rebooted, while forgetting what made them so enjoyable (looking at you Painkiller and Duke Nukem), Flying Wild Hog has not only revived an aging series, but they've done so with good design sensibility, and an explosion filled, blood soaked shoot fest that also happens to have some very satisfying swordplay. 8.5/10.",

I'm first gonna give off a warning that I reccomend buying this when it's for an absolute steal, this game can go on sale for 5 dollars for the special edition that includes a bit more content, compared to the 40+ dollars non-sale price, however, if you want to show support for the developers, purchase the game in full, this game is just incredible, and feels more like a 60 dollar Triple A game done right.  Shadow Warrior is a game set within a stereotypical China, this game is heavily influenced from cheesy Japanese movies, and I love every second of it, this story keeps you entertained and invested as you travel to wildly different locales from a Japanese graveyard to a Tanker ship and watch the plot unfold, it has all sorts of cheese, including a very memorable protagonist in Lo Wang, who has a relatively stereotypical voice that is still interesting to listen to, especially in conversations with his demon buddy, Hoji. The gameplay is hands down the best part of this, Shadow Warrior makes itself different with it's star-based system that rewards you with extra Karma(Basically experience points) based on how well you kick Demon ♥♥♥, I've gone through over 10 chapters and haven't gotten a single 5-star, but this is motivation for me to try harder and hopefully get better to the point I get that 5 star. Thrown in is the best sword in any FPS ever, the player's Katana is the most versatile tool the player has, and it naturally upgrades over time as you continue the story, it can do powerful bursts of damage, an area swing, and one of those fancy air slashes that can mow down groups of enemies chasing you.  Hopefully I didn't overwrite stuff, or missed small details, but I can go on and on about why I think this is an excellent game and one of the best purchases I made in a while. Please, buy it, maybe even buy it while it's full priced to show the developers some love.  This is seriously what Duke Nukem should've been...minus the sword, and uh...less Shadow Warrior, more Duke.",

            "review_text": "Shadow Warrior could easily be called the holy grail of slasher games. From start to end this 10 to 12 hour long game will keep you interested as the games story has multiple major plot twists that'll keep you wanting to play. The beginning of the game starts on a very happy very comical note. As the main character you play as Lo Wang, a fit katana wielding Asian man who is not to be reckoned with. As you progress through the story you see that it begins to take on a much more serious tone towards the middle of the game. As the player you begin to feel a connection between you and your companion who follows around during the majority of the game. This is interesting because it shows us that the writers crafted the story well enough for the player to care about the games characters. Overall the games story is great, but at some points in the game I felt as though the only reason I actually was progressing through the game was less because the gameplay was stimulating. But more so because I wanted to find out what came next in the story. Ok brutally slashing through hordes of demons is fun and the many upgrades that you can apply to Lo Wang and his weapons are great as far as gameplay goes. But in contrary gameplay can be very repetitive as most of the time you'll find yourself destroying totems in order to open doors only to turn around and find that you need to fight another wave of demons. I found that this slight repetitiveness is the games only downfall. Aside from that Lo Wang makes tons of funny comments and references during the duration of the game along with multiple easy to find Easter eggs that will have you laughing for minutes at a time. Aside from game play, the games art looks amazing. The games assets and environments are detailed to the brim and the game delivers some extremely captivating visuals, hell I even saw Godzilla walking around in the background of the second mission! Along side its fluent and beautiful looking character animations. The sounds in the game are stellar and give off a very majestic vibe. All the characters voices sound unique and creative, like nothing I've ever heard from any other game before. This title is well worth the price that it's sold at. The only problems I experienced with the game was one single crash, and some of my hot-keys messing up. Luckily these problems aren't enough to ruin the game in any way. I recommend this game to anyone looking for a new unique title, A good laugh, or just something to hold you over until another big box game is released. I loved the game, I still have a lot of unanswered questions and I'm looking forward to a sequel.  If you made it this far thanks for reading.   - Mojo",

            "review_text": "Shadow Warrior is a reboot/prequel of the obscure 1997 shooter developed by 3D realms (creators of the legendary Duke Nukem.) The reboot was developed by Flying Wild Hog and published by Devolver Digital. After playing the original game along side the two expansion packs I was eager to get my hands on the reboot once it was announced on May 10, 2013 the trailer showed promise and looked like what a reboot should be.   Once I finally purchased and started playing I was introduced to our main hero and one-liner zinger Lo Wang an assassin who works for the powerful Japanese industrial magnate, Orochi Zilla. He is sent to a mission to purchase an ancient katana from a collector named Mizayaki for 2 million dollars. Mizayaki refuses the offer and Lo Wang tries to take the sword by force which takes a horrible turn for the worse. 'Let's see... briefcase full of cash... blade... million dollar smile... ready for school, ma!' This game has a soild presentation and reinstated the hopes I had for the game. The story does do its job right with interesting, funny and downright awesome characters, and the plot keeps you engaged thoughout.  Gameplay wise it is almost flawless, old school with exploration for secrets in well designed levels and run and gun combat with modern elements and amazing sword fighting. Gunplay is soild and fun with great toys to play with against anything that bleeds although I would have liked to see abit more weapons and some more returning guns like the riot gun (a gatling shotgun) from the original game. Sword play really stands out and is really satisfying with full control of different swings to hack and slash any foe that dare crosses you alongside with special chi moves to bend reality to your will, you can also upgrade guns, skills and power to create more havok. There are some problem with the game unfortunately the maps can be a wee repatative, the guns are way to underpowered with the katana killing enemies with ease and the later demons can be way too annoying on the hardest difficulties.  Visually the game is stunning and alot of work has been done to make the game look jaw dropping there are some low quality textures even on highest settings and some cutscenes animations look terrible but they get a pass due to being rare. On launch this game was brutal to run but thanks to a recent patch it did help abit however it is still very terribly unoptimized which is unacceptable for a PC launch games, a huge bummer that ruins the experience. The game is out on Windows and with the recent patch Mac OSX and Linux is now supported. Music, sound and voice acting are pretty good aswell with a kickass soundtrack, witty and hilarious voicework and writing and satisfying sounds this game has a good amount of polish but could have been a little better.   Overall Shadow Warrior has to been one of my favourite shooters of all time and if your even slightly curious do play it I 100% recommend it. Packed with tons of content I have not completed still and you can even play the original free on Steam.   'Do you want cake or death? I should mention that we are all out of cake.'",

The gameplay is tight, you move fast, the enemies strafe and dodge your fire. The environments are detailed and feel realistic (as opposed to Seriouis Sam, where alleys look like football stadiums). The game is linear, but there are plenty of hidden gems and secrets to be found. It's also full of references to old school shooters.  This game is gorgeous, even on low settings. But if you want higher fidelity you'd have to add a bit of heat to your graphics cards.   Sometimes the enemies feel a bit repetitive or even bullet-spongey. The characters are maybe a bit too macho to be likeable, the same way that Bulletstorm's characters didn't really appeal to me.",

Awesome graphics, secret location, tonnes of enemies and blood!   Another reason to get this game is the ability to cast Getsuga Tenshou. I mean how many games out there allows you to do that.  Shadow warrior is a first person shooter set in today's Japan. You can wield guns or a samurai sword that both can be upgraded (which is awesome). As you progress in the game, you will earn/collect skill points where you can spend on upgrading offensive/defensive spell or your ability. This takes the game to a whole new level and huge variety of play style.   The levels are linear where you only have to follow a single path available. Huge amount of enemies will spawn when you reach a huge open area. This is also indicated by the background music.   The plot is alright but you will tend to get a little confuse at first because you cannot familiarize with the names and the story telling is vague in the beginning.   I highly recommend this game if you are a fan of clean, simple, classic first person shooter.   When you complete the game, you are given a new play mode where you can keep all the upgrades from the previous game. However they will reset your sword upgrade which sucks.",

            "review_text": "The game is a glorious throwback ONLY to the things we loved about old school, combining just the right elements of what was good in old school:  - Carry your momma's kitchen arsenal in your pockets and switch between the tools of craft on the fly - Hordes of enemies coming at you at all times, to keep you entertained - Smart spawning making sure you never get too bored of enemies - GORE! You like blood? Boy do we have a game for you! Enemies blow up, melt, burn into thousands of physical pieces and amazing splatters, yet the gore somehow always feel balanced. Bloody enough to make you hungry, but reasonable enough not to trigger an allergic reaction to Red. - Secrets! A ton of secrets! Some have goodies, some have hilarious easter eggs. All are hidden well, but the game teaches the player as to where they might be hidden, they are placed smartly such that the location is reasonbly hidden, but not impossible to get to without exploiting the game. - Speed! Miss running around like Sonic the 'Hedgehog'? Now you can! Wang is really fast indeed, and you can make him durable with upgrades, if you lady complains.  And for the year 2013, when it was released this game has  - Amazing developer support: bunch of free DLC, free funny version of Viscera Cleanup with the deluxe edition, and a great polished and bug, lag, glitch and hitch-free game from the former devs of Bulletstorm, Painkiller and Hard Reset. - Amazing graphics - Multi-dimensional combat (vertical element mixed in) - Very different enemies with variety of attacks and engagement tactic possibilities. - Great pacing, the game gives you something drastically new to play with all the time, every time you get bored of something you seem to get something new - Interesting, but not forced pogression. Most upgrades are active and add new gameplay instead of just passive buffs. Thus by upgrading you mostly also turn up the skill ceiling - Amazing melee. The game's melee is famous enough, but it deserves every bit of praise it gets. The enemies chop up in physically-correct pieces and the katana is wold-space, meaning it actually goes through the enemies. The cuts leave decals on the bodies and there are a ton of combos to use. Variace of combos also gives extra points. The katana is very powerful, but very difficult to master and makes the game so much more diverse. - Storyline is also surprisingly diverse. It turns from a sarcastic oneliner-filled commentary of mayhem into a beatiful chinese-theme myth storyline, and accomplishes both parts well.  The game does not come without it's caveats however, here they are:  - Some enemies are very annoying to fight. For example there are enemies who can spawn trash mobs infinitely and can put a shield around them which is unbreakable until you kill off every trash it has spawned. This can take a long time and is very annoying when there are other enemies on the field. Another enemy is one which can only be damaged in the back. The back spot is almost always at an angle and when you shoot it, the imperfections in collision mesh really do show and it is infuirating. These things also have a huge and in no way indicated AoE and can kill if you dont upgrade health simply by pounding the ground, and damaging you for 60 points even though you are a hundred meters away. - BLOOM! ♥♥♥♥ing bloom is over-the-top. If you turn it off, it makes usable objects more difficult to see and projectiles more difficult to dodge, but it is really badly balanced and rapes your eyes way too much in many, if not all, areas. - Balance. Weapons are not very well balanced. The shotgun, for example, is very underpowered, especially considering it can have and fire 4 barrels at once. At point blank it can't even kill a lowly shield demon with a shot like that, which is really bad. Flamethrower is also lacklustre. The Crowssbow is annoying to use because it has no scope. - The descent from light-hearted to serious and sad storyline happens a bit too fast and definite for my liking. It's literally one loading screen split. And after that point, no jokes, no sarcastic comments, no humour at all. I appreciate the diversity, but it was too black and white. Or rather Purple and Orange in case of this game. - Replay value. This game could have used coop. A LOT. It has a lot of weapons, combos and abilities that support coop very well, and none of the new free DLCs sadly add much replay value to the game. Levels are also, while riddles with secrets, are totally linear. Also every arena seems to be designed for a particular approach and fighting style, and the game is rock-hard. Too hard to allow the player to choose and experiment. This is not Bulletstorm. You either do it the 'right way' or bam. I hope you quicksaved. Thus when you know how to beat the game the second playthrough has little to offer aside from secrets you havent discovered or upgrades you haven't purchased.  For what it is it's 6-8 hours of pure adrenaline-filled violent, beautiful fun without a hitch, lag, bug or boring bit at any point in that time. It plays as smoothly as it runs and leaves you very satisfied with your purchase. There are many ways in which it could be better, coop being one of them, but it's not a full-priced game and it's not meant to be the best ever shooter with all features in the world. And what it means to be it is. And it's that damn good at it.  Alright, ladies, who wants some Wang?!",

The graphics are fantastic, the gameplay is addicting, the action intense (and sometimes quite infuriating), the voice acting perfectly done, the humor excellent and a superb soundtrack. I like that it basically takes place in the late 80s. This is indicated by the big brick cellphone Lo Wang uses in his car during the prologue cinematic and that he is listening to (as well as singing along with) the great Stan Bush song 'The Touch' from 'The Transformers Animated Movie' (1986). Wang is accompanied throughout the game by a friendly demon-ish spirit, Hoji, that attaches to him via a mask on his leg and only reappears visually during cinematic scenes. I say demon-ish in that he isn't a monster. His appearance is more like a jester with a dull one-color patchwork outfit sewn together and his mask is harlequin-like in design. Their conversations are always interesting and often funny. There is so much to like about this new revision of the game. One of the little bits I love is when you get into a really big fight, and you are hacking and slashing down enemies all around you, part of the way into it or near the end, Lo Wang will laugh out loud at the craziness of the situation or say some funny line. BTW, be sure to shoot all the rabbits you see, but also be prepared to take on the hardcore dark hare that appears every so often. It's sort of a nod to the killer rabbit from 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' film.  Another fun thing the developers did is give random nods to the original game via hidden areas that use the same graphics as back then. It really is impressive to see how much computer animation has come when you can look at them side by side in places like this. You go from blocky, flat, low-tech graphics to near photo realism.  I used to be big into game soundtracks, but fell out for many, many years. This game has drawn me back in. I'm actually listening to the soundtrack right now as I type this review (which comes with the collector's edition of the game, though I had to balance the songs volume wise in my audio editor. Their base levels were way too high. Reminded me of the great 'Black Mesa Source' game soundtrack). You will really enjoy the music in this game. It goes from atmospheric to all-out action to Asian chamber music, some with choir portions that remind me of the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' soundtrack. I still need to put the songs in play order though. They are all mixed up instead of being sequential as heard while playing. I dislike it when they do that. It's better to hear a soundtrack like it is in the movie or game, in play order.  The one thing that I have trouble with is the use of the special powers. Most of the time, I hardly use them. Resorting more to the hack 'n' slash sword play or long distance gunning. Being that you need to use a combination of keys and a mouse buttons, most often it's just annoying. Yes, they are useful at times, especially the healing ability (when you can get it activated) and the shockwave attack.  All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game to all FPS (first person shooter) fans. You will not be disappointed. But, I will warn you that there are times when you'll yell with irritation after being killed more times than needed during a battle.",

The swordplay makes melee combat much more fun than the gunplay; but the over the top 4-in-1 shot quad-barrel shotgun and the laser guided 3-in-1 shot rocker launcher really make a strong effort for attention. Tons of unlockable abilities and skills, and the ability to carry every weapon in the game simultaneously mean your arsenal never runs dry. From channeled shields, and healing spells; to spinning blade attacks, and one-shot charge stabs, no one playstyle is going to be 'the best' really leaving you open to play the way you feel most comfortable. The level's are designed well, and there are tons of secrets to find in each one. The characters are all likable, and the dialogue is the perfect mixture of over-the-top action movie and video game/comic book nerd humor. The story is fine, no complaints, it's deep but never goes 2deep4u, it unfolds at a good pace and could be skipped entirely if you just want to cut more demons and dudes up with your Katana. Shadow Warrior is a fantastic game that all FPS fans should play, let the post 2005 gamers see why the retro FPS players always talk about how great the genre used to be. This game gets a #1 Super A+ out of ten/5",

Crashes constantly through out the game and at the end I got so fed up with the crashes I decided to just watch the ending on Youtube. But that might just be on my side.  The combat gets very repetitive.  I feel like the guns weren't really necessary and you could beat the game with only your sword.

Even though I recommend this game to everyone who enjoys action and FPS games, this game has it's fair shares of flaws which I will mention now in an attempt for the devs to learn from this constructive evaluation and improve it in their next game!   Cons   1) Get-up animation when you have fallen a certain distance is very slow and un-ninja like.  2) We should be able to equip our best 4 weapons after a certain point in the game before the mission starts :) good idea? I know thanks. Instead of scrolling through them or key stroking all the way to the 9 key.  3) Long level load times. This needs to be cut by at least half time.  4) While secrets are cool, it eventually occupies half (or more) of your mission time looking for them, only to find out that you miss some secrets nearly every mission which can be frustrating for most players..  5) Falling a short distance onto a walkable surface can easily kill you or at least damage you which is bad game design for a ninja warrior game and also bad programming. (this is especially true when you shadow dash on a staircase)  6) It's good to save in this game frequently but menu transition time while in game is very laggy.  7) The default zoom button is an awkward key to use for aiming. (I use CRTL)  8) The Pistol and Shurikens are pretty much useless throughout the game. Make them stronger and implement the shurikens with a capacity.  9) Chapter 15 is a joke. Horrible and slow cut scenes and no killing..  10) Cutscenes are mostly awkward and slow. Make them more exciting!  Thank you for reading my review and rate it up or comment if you agree with it.",

            "review_text": "Not so much a sequel, prequel, reimagining, or reboot of the original Shadow Warrior, but some combination of all four. It's surprisingly loyal to the source material, but gives more than enough of its own voice so it doesn't feel like it's needlessly pandering to a niche fanbase. Everything is vibrant and colorful to look at, especially at the beginning, though it falls off in acts two and three as you move to more drab, industrial environments.  The gameplay is simple but fun, mindless violence. If you like blood, this game has it in spades. Enemies don't just drop down dead; they go in pieces and explosions of blood that leaves areas coated in red. The genius of the game is that if you have a favored weapon, you can pretty much go through the entire game with that weapon and never feel like the you're being pressured to use something else. The combat itself is pretty much the same from beginning to end, with new enemies and new weapons and powers added over time, but it's done right so that it's never a chore in order to move on to the next level.  The sword was a fantastic weapon in the original game, and they made it even better in this. The sword feels sharp and powerful when you swing it, and when you cut something apart, the sound and the enemy reactions feels like you're cutting through flesh and bone, not just whacking a guy over the head with a stick until they die.  There are two major downsides, however. The first is that this game is very resource intensive, so if you don't have a powerful computer, forget it. The second is the bosses are the old three hit pattern bosses with glowing weak points. They aren't terrible, but it subtracts from figuring out the best way to kill the new enemy by having their weak points highlighted to you and forcing you to remove their armor in specific patterns.  Other than that, this game does everything right, and is a testament to what Duke Nukem Forever should have been.",

Lo Wang, the main character, starts the game trying to get a sword to his employer, Zilla, and after that he spends most of the game fighting demons with the help of a banned demon named Hoji. The plot is not the best I've seen, but is very good, and the acting is even better. I admit I spend the entire game looking for a twist, but the story is very straightforward, and after any chapter we want to play the next one just to discover another bit of it. Thumbs up.   The story mode is the main thing in the game. It took me about 14h to go through, and I've enjoyed every single bit.      2- GAMEPLAY   The game plays great. I have some issues with the controls, but just because I'm not very skilled and I do not like when I have button combinations to trigger a move.   The swordplay is great, and I was always trying to use it just for the fun, despite having a lot of weapons that could make my life a bit easier. Being able to carry all weapons we can find was great, and the chance to upgrade them even better. It's funny that the sword destroys almost everything bt is not able to go through bambu. There're strong bambu in Japan.   We have 3 independent skill trees to unlock and upgrade abilities, but we never feel overpowered. New opponents are always a bit stronger or annoying than the previous one, and the new abilities are always welcome and needed.   The levels are long and kinda labirintish. We have no map, and sometimes we feel a bit lost. That's normal, and you always find the way out. Normally is the blinking door. There are a lot of secrets to find, and that gives you some replay ability. The fortune cookies where a lot of fun, and I was always looking for a new one, just to have a laugh reading them.   When a enemy locks on us the music always changes. It's nice to set the mood, but is always a warning to when we have enemies, since after we kill any horde, the music goes back to normal. I rather prefer to have to look for the enemies and be surprised when I see them.   There are some recycled sets, but there is no problem. The references to Serious Sam are obvious, and the gameplay and artstyle are very similar.      3- CONCLUSION   This game is now at 34,99€ at Steam, and I would not pay that price for the game. I've bought it in a sale for under 5€, and for that price you have to try it.   Oooh, just the demon rabbits alone worth the 5€ tag.

There will be times where you will take on quite a few demons all at once quickly cycling between your arsenal of weapons...gunning down, torching, chopping off heads/limbs, BIG BOOM, etc all in one fight.   As for the sword play, I was fairly impressed. The developers did create some fun sword moves. I highly recommend you learn to use all of your abilities; don't just roll through this game as a shooter. You have some cool powers and sword moves to include with your guns too; so don't forget to use them or you'll miss out on some content.   The length of the game was decent too; I doub't you'll blaze through this in one day/night. There are 17 Chapters 'levels' in all and some of them took me over an hour each; definitely if you're like me and like to look for all the hidden secrets.   Unless your one of those lucky few who have bottomless pit bank accounts; I would wait until this goes on sale. *cough* summer...I wouldn't say your wasting $40 on it now while its not but would def recommend picking this up when its on sale.",

However levels are basically mazes, in that you could wander around for hours and then find a tiny button or a gun you need to pick up for some nonsensical reason.  I spent atleast two hours in this game wandering the hallways only to find the thing i needed. Its really weirdly linear. This wouldn't be the problem if the keys to get through the door weren't so annoying to find and could be done in any order besides one.  For example. At one point about halfway through, i was in a shipyard trying to get past this propeller that had a gap in it and was obstructing my path. I had no idea what to do. But there was a powerbox nearby so i assumed i could just press it.  No i had to go back up the stairs, find some C4 that blended into the floor texture, and then i could open the power box.  And some enemies are just completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Especially the iron golems. You have to shoot a spot on their back. This isn't a problem but they still have way to much health, have no indication of whether or not you're doing any damage. And later it starts spamming the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s alongside other tough enemies.   And bosses are just 'Shoot this one big guy until he zones out and his armor opens showing some crystals to shoot' The mystic story is complete tripe on a sandwich made of batshit.  Also theirs obligatory kamakaze enemies, except sometimes they ♥♥♥♥ out little balls of radioactive snot that either sit there orr roll at you.  Speaking of which, explosions have way to much blast radius. I could be 20 feet away and still take damage from a small one.  Now for the good.  Its funny, it looks good, its reasonably long for an indie game. Sword play is fun. The gore system is amazing and fun to play with. Bosses and some enemies actually have some cool designs. Levels are pretty.  I had fun with it, maybe you will, but i don't blame you if you don't.",

Tired of playing the brave American soldier blowing the bejeebus out of Russians or developing countries full of brown people because 'TERRISM' ? Tired of re-living the same stupid cold war fantasies over and over? Do you enjoy the occasional wang-joke while beheading a demon with your katana? If you long for the days shooters featured over the top action heroes who carried 9 weapons and a bandolier full of one-liners then this game is for you.   Meet Lo Wang, a lovable assassin with a big sword and an even bigger ego who gets caught up in a demon apocalypse. Shadow Warrior is a game that sits very comfortably inbetween modern shooters and classic ones. You can aim down sights, but you don't have to. There are med-kits and you can regenerate your own health, though not by sitting in a corner sucking your thumbs for 10 seconds. Beyond that you can upgrade your guns, learn new abilities to help you cut through the demon hordes as well as gain access to dark powers which can heal or protect you, and allow you to control the battlefield. This is NOT a cover-based shooter, why take cover when you can charge in with your sword and become a tornado of death? As Lo Wang himself says: 'come for the shoot-outs, stay for the sword fights' It should be noted that Shadow Warrior revels in its over the top gore and violence, though this is mostly directed at demons, but occasionaly also at humans. The game also has a lot of secret areas for you to find, often containing resources that allow you to upgrade and improve your guns and abilities. The down-side to this is that there are a lot of these in every level, and if you miss them, you'll miss a big chunk of upgrades and abilities.  Is Shadow Warrior the shooter messiah? Our saviour from the endless parade of military shooters? Sadly, it is not. The game isn't perfect, it has its flaws. But it's a fun ride, the sword-play aspect in particular is enough reason to buy this game.  You should get some Wang in your life.",

So, Shadow Warrior is a game in which you are Lo Wang. Near the start you get a demon sword and a gun. Then there are demons, big and small and everything in between, some hopping between dimensions (ours and a demon world) and the whole game is bathed with references to old games as well as a metric ton of crude humor and ♥♥♥♥-jokes (hey, his name IS Wang!).  The game is suitably pretty, (non-human) enemies are very well animated, environments are detailed, if a bit repetitive in some areas, the weapons and attacks are inventive and fun and the combat simply flows well. The voice acting is not nearly as cringe-worthy as the intro makes it seem (just give it a while, you'll get used to it), however the music is mostly bland and unnoticeable.

If you do not enjoy a game which is solely combat oriented and leading trough a linear pathway, you will not like this. while i am a guy who is very passionate about atmosphere, immersion and soundtrack, gameplay is vital for me to enjoy a game. and while this game's only strenght is gameplay, i am fine with this. gameplaywise though, some people might find a problem that combat is always head on, and there is only a limited way of defeating your ennemies besides facing them straight forward, but you should not expect anything else from an arcady shooter. a major problem i got with this game though is that it gets repetitive after a while, and towards the end of the game i started using almost the same attack over and over since it was the most efficient one. you will find yourself mostly using ki-strikes with your katana and the fun weapons are alot less useful since they do not regenerate your health and do mostly less damage.",

Thanks to the little rpg elements and the fact that your katana gets upgrades as you progress through game, it remains viable way to play till the end. Personally, I used guns only during boss fights, well and against airborne enemies. But make no mistake gunplay feels good too.  I was suprised that it even has something you could call story (well, or a reason why the ingame events are happening), and it's a decent one. Not just something like: There is a guy that wants to destroy, enslave, etc. the world because he's evil and emotionally deprived individual. Game doesn't take itself too seriously (it is obvious from the beginning), and that is a good thing. Your masked companion pulls one joke after another and Lo Wang has some up his sleeves aswell. Sadly, amount of funny lines noticeably tins out before first boss. But one can't save the universe with constant grin, right?  It took me over 14 hours to complete this game on hard difficulty, that is quite impressive for FPS.

            "review_text": "Quick Summary: First person shooter/slasher from the makers of Hard Reset and Serious Sam. I’ve never played the original Shadow Warrior games so I don’t know if this is a remake in terms of story, but it’s fully entertaining, with a likeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ main character dropping one-liners like Duke Nukem. There is an RPG-like upgrade system allowing you to power up as you progress through the game, and an EX mode (new game plus) so you can replay the game with all your upgrades.   Your character is a modern day mercenary/samurai/badass named Lo Wang who’s on a job acquiring an ancient katana with mystical demon killing powers. Unfortunately, evil forces are afoot, both human and demonic, so the fate of the world is in peril and you really need that sword. Lo Wang is no ordinary ♥♥♥ kicker though. Due to some demonic help you gain along the way, you can use “ki” to bolster your fighting style and smite down demons with a variety of guns, spells, and even demonic body parts.   You control Lo Wang in first person perspective, and while you will find various guns along your travels, your first weapon may be your best. The katana you start with is strong, fast, and can use ki skills such as whirling slash or a powered up forward thrust (you choose which skill you use by entering button combinations). Very similar to Hard Reset and Serious Sam, the enemies in the game tend to come at you in small groups, but they have enough life that it takes a bit of focused fire to kill each one, by which time the others will be all over you. Fortunately, (just like Hard Reset) there are a ton of destructible environmental objects that can be blown up (barrels, cars, etc.) to soften the enemies before they get close to you. Be careful because in big firefights, there will be a lot of ♥♥♥♥ blowing up.  There are 3 main upgrade “trees” for Lo Wang: Powers, Skills, and Weapons, and all three trees use a different type of upgrade currency. There are a number of collectibles in the game as well, some of it pretty well hidden. You’ll be rewarded for using different fighting styles and environmental kills, so you’ll want to master the various skills that Lo Wang has at his disposal. The spells/skills that he uses involve combinations of directional keys and the mouse buttons, for example D, D, right-mouse casts a heal spell, or A, A, left-mouse is the whirling slash. These powers will save your ♥♥♥, so make sure you use them all the time.  Pros: +A lot of (wang) humor and a decent story. You have a smartass companion for most of the game, so the 2 play off of each other for comedy. +There are some huge firefights where you’ll be running away from enemies in large arenas, casting your heal spell, trying not to get pinned down. Every level has a bunch of mini bosses as well, adding to the chaos.  +Because of the unusual upgrade system, there is a lot of re-playability in the game. You need to play through the campaign more than once just to unlock all the skills and weapon upgrades.  Cons: -On the higher difficulty, a lot of the enemies (especially mini bosses) are bullet sponges. It takes a ton of firepower to bring them down while their minions bite at your ankles. The big bosses of the game are the same way, in that they have so much life that even if they stand still it takes a long time to kill them.  -Compared to Hard Reset, Shadow Warrior has superior gameplay, but the graphics actually look worse. This might be because Hard Reset is a futuristic cyberpunk environment with lots of pretty lasers and exploding things, while Shadow Warrior purposely incorporates a lot of retro graphics. -While I like the assortment of guns, you’ll end up not using some of them very much. For example the shotgun, crossbow, and flamethrower are nice for adding some variety to the game, but they have practical drawbacks. The shotgun only holds 4 shots in a clip, enemies move in unusual lurching ways that make the crossbow difficult to aim, and enemies have too much life for the flamethrower to be very effective. Just stick with the sword, and power up your ki attacks for maximum carnage.  Overall Shadow Warrior is an awesome game if you like retro first person shooters (Doom, Quake, etc., NOT Call of Duty). If you’re going for Steam achievements, you should know that a lot of the achievements in this game are ‘tiered’ just like Hard Reset. This means that most of the achievements are separate for all 4 difficulties (One achievement for easy, one for normal, one for hard, and one for insane). Or you can play the game in insane difficulty and unlock them all at once. If you’re the kind of player (like me) that likes to play games in Normal difficulty, you’ll only get about ½ of Shadow Warrior’s achievements. First playthrough took me about 14 hours because I was searching for all the secrets.  ",

For one, it encapsulates all that made the old shooters fun: massive amounts of enemies, weapons that are fun to use and a good mixture of humor. That latter deserves extra mentioning, as the main storyline is actually quite heavy-handed and ridden with family-tragedy. However, with Lo Wang (that's your character), Hoji (your guide) and the fortune cookies doing all the humor part, it actually has a decent narrative overall.  I do have to mention that it's quite clear that this is from the same developers who made Hard reset. Levels are rather linear and have plenty of explosive things in it that can trigger chain reactions (even bikes tend to explode in an extreme way). The visuals may be better and offer more variety, it is clearly on the same engine. Not that I'm complaining: hard reset was a decent game and this one is even better. Why? Because the upgrade system is more fleshed out, weapons are more fun and the ammo, fortune cookies and easter eggs (like the bunnies) make levels feel less empty.  The katana deserves extra mentioning. Even though this is technically a shooter, the katana is actually a very good weapon. The disadvantage of having to be so close is countered by the extra abilities you can learn from it (as well as it playing part in the plot). While not usefull on bosses, I often switched to this weapon to just start slashing away. It's fun...and deservedly so. :-)  What more to mention? Well...oriental theme, decent music, good variety in levels...I can recommend it. It doesn't automatically heal you, but you have a heal spell you can keep using. In any case: if you like oldskool shooters, you really should try this game. It's worth it. :-)",

As far as a corridor shooter goes Shadow Warrior has one of the best stories I've seen, it is surprisingly competent, funny, mindbending, and even heart-wrenching at times.   My gripes with the game are very minor   Invisible walls are inconsistent throughout the game, in some places you can explore far beyond where you thought you could, but in others you seem to be constrained.   Secondly, the graphics are a touch dated, but in all honesty it doesn't subtract from the game too heavily at all.  ",

However, this is hands down the closest you will get these days to an old school chaotic shooter like the original FPSes.  You will routinely face dozens of enemies on screen at once, and mow them all down in bloody glory with guns, rockets, flamethrower, a variety of katanas and a wonderful crossbow. Each of them is somewhat versatile as well and demons will enrage, making them harder and faster, if you do not kill them quickly. Many of the enemies have various attacks and the game continues to introduce new demons until the very end of the game, at which point it begins to throw all of them at you the same time, like old Doom would on high difficulties.  The voice acting is ridiculous, the asian (mostly Chinese) stereotypes are cliche and borderline offensive, and the control system is downright wonky to master. You may not even realize how to do half your abilities until the end of your first playthrough.   I wouldn't recommend the game for $40, but the next time it's on sale, if you are a fan of true FPS, definitely grab this game.",

It's actually pretty interesting, I expected a lot less, seeming as we live in an era infested with bland, mediocre, and thoughtless shooters. I had bought this for $9.99 on sale. Worth every penny for that price, but 29.99 tops is all you should part with. $39.99 seems a bit harsh though, as it can feel repititious, and maybe a little bland to some, I actually, come to think of it, payed, '12.49' on sale, I bought the special edition. Now, this lady BARELY plays shooters, I was actually disappointed with far cry 4, but this, well this is a blood bath. If you love violent hack and slashes, hurry and buy this on sale, beheading people feels like bliss in this! The demons feel bland, and not very diverse, but this feels like it was intended, as Lo Wang makes a wisecrack, 'Not to sound racist, but you demons all look alike.' hinting, this was in fact INTENDED! The shooting controls are tight, responsive, and all around fluid, and easy to use. For my 2.4 almosttwo and a half hours play time, I can say if you like violent games like, 'Manhunt' but also like an FPS game, buy this, the gore is amazing, I find myself torturing opponents. The sword play, listen here, you come for the promise of a crazy, out there FPS game, but you STAY for those katana controls. It is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥! The sword, you will find yourself donning the katana, and only using lead based weaponry for certain situations, JUST, JUST so you can carve up fresh victims! The controls, well, never really feel overwhelming, or nonresponsive. But, alas, there are some severe issues, though some can be negligible. The frame rate is an issue, it seems to drop a good bit. I will admit, it never drops too often in combat, unless there is an immense number of enemies, and spells occuring on screen. Best to buy on sale, than, well, let's put it this way, 4.5/5 for this game on discount, regular price, dropped it to abouuuuuuuut, 3.25/5 The story is convoluted, jumbled, and hard to follow, but just ignore it if it bores you so much.",

Fluid and easy to use you can go through the game gunslinging, swordwielding or using chi powers or more likely a mix of all of them. If you collect gold and secrets... an easy feat if you're thorough (getting them all is more challenging!!!) allows you to unlock most if not all things near the end of the game.  There is a distinct RPG element. You improve your Chi abilities (healing, telekinesis, defensive spells etc), upgrade your sword abilities, upgrade your weapons (weapons that become truly cheesy and over the top as you upgrade them!!!) and thus you truly feel like there is progression in the game. Your char becomes a veritable badass.  The swordplay and use of special abilities is exquisite and although I used all weapons and many abilities I did mostly focus on swordplay for large sections of the levels and it is extremely satisfying the way the sword handles. Gunplay is not to be underestimated and just as cool and over the top. Dual wielding submachine guns, upgrading your shotgun to become a 4 barrelled monstrosity or unleashing fiery deaths with a blazing upgraded flamethrower.  A good mixture and variety of weapons, abilities and skills spice things up and keep everything exciting. There is decent enemy variety but it's the bossfights that steal the show. Avoiding spoilers i'll just say these things are BIG!!!  The storyline is also awesome. It starts out purposely cheesy an cliché but halfway the storyline things become far more enthralling with a last quarter that will make you want to push through just to know the conclusion. A conclusion that is most gripping and impactful... no mean feat for an FPS!  The cast is brilliant especially your 'companion' Hoji who ensures that the hero 'Wang' can unleash frequent comical banter. The two work brilliantly together. The 'employer' Zilla and his Twin Assassins showed a lot of promise and although not the main focus of the storyline proved quite entertaining. In fact Hoji's side of the story is an epic Japanese mythological tale while Wangs side of it all feels like a cheesy cool-factor rich over the top aciton flick. And the two sides of the coin mesh brilliantly albeit unexpectedly.  Humor, meta humor and injokes are a constant throughout the game, the same with the amusing collectible fortune cookies.  I also wish to mention there is an EX mode which i have yet to tackle but it allows you to replay the game keeping all you unlocked. A feature i ALWAYS appreciate in games with an rpg system. Next time i play the game i shall be digging into it.  All in all, this is a must buy for fans of the FPS genre. Especially if you want a mix of all that is good about modern shooters and all that is good about the old retro shooters. Add in the awesome setting, atmosphere, dialogue and gameplay options and you probably get my shooter of the year. Perhaps even... ever? Certainly Top 5 favourite FPS's ever. And an experience in itself.  Now here's hoping we get a sequel with even more bang for our buck!",

Shadow Warrior 2013 is great for fans of the original, but for newbs to the 'series', it stands on its own as a fast paced and fun shooter you have to play to believe.   Did I say shooter? I meant slasher. The Katana is the standout weapon in the arsenal, and you'll probably use it well over half of the time. Swordplay is more than just wildly clicking hoping some limbs will wall off. Player movement and weapon hand movement determine your strike angle, allowing for precise swordplay. The result of which is a ground littered with body parts you sliced off, and blood. Lots of blood. And like the good old days of fast paced shooters, there's no blocking, no hiding behind cover. Its kick ♥♥♥ or die.  Beyond swordplay, there's a wonderful arsenal of other weapons to change up your methods of death dealing, from pistol to crossbow to the ever funny sticky bomb. Switching up your fighting style has the added benefit of winning you more karma points, which I'll get into more later on.  Let's talk about the real surprise Shadow Warrior delivers.   The story.

Bad: - As others said, the enemy variety was average. Also it's very annoying I can't just import my progress from the story into survival mode.   With the fluidity of controls and wide variety of weapons\\attacks this game will harken back to that feeling you got being a bad ♥♥♥ space marine in Doom.

            "review_text": "Lengthy campaign, involving story, no multiplayer - good stuff all around. Voice-acting is simply excellent, weapons are a fun mixture of precision and collateral damage. Enemies are generally a joy to kill (More on that later). Visuals are a treat, physics and damage model make combat an exercise in surgery.  However. Some enemies take the pace out of the combat a bit too often. The basic demon is great - it usually appears in larger numbers, can be killed easily enough (Unless it enrages) and keeps you moving around. But the shield-bearers, berserkers and warlords all take too much time to kill, even with fully upgraded weapons.  Basically, what I wanted from this game was a horde of simpler enemies to cut down. The later weapons (Rocket launcher, flamethrower, upgraded katana) basically scream for stuff to murder, except there isnt any. During the campaign, monsters spawn at select points, in 1 or 2 waves. You advance a few rooms or corridors, and repeated.  Which brings me to the Survival mode, which isnt much of an improvement. Sure, the action gets more hectic, but the amount of enemies doesnt. For example, instead of 15 basic demons, you get 2 berserkers (which require shooting a specific weakspot) and a demon that resurrects fallen enemies, but also shields itself till the resurrectees are dealt with. All of which aren't difficult to bring down, but they take ages! It may seem like a silly complaint, but when you have weapons like the rocket launcher, you want to shoot it right into the middle of a mob of monsters and what their limbs fly all over the place. Shooting a rocket at just 1 warlord is just... ugh, no. It's just not a return to the good old murderfests like Doom.  Anyway, it's a fun romp. The setting is a bit odd - Chinese guy (in what is presumably Japan) wants to buy a sword from a collector, ♥♥♥♥ happens. One-liners ensue, fantastic locations are visited, lots of exposition in cartoon-esque cinematics and ingame events, original lore.  Fun game with a style of combat that might not be everyone's cup of ricewine.",

            "review_text": "This game was by far the best new FPS to come out in 2013 and a shining example on how to reboot an old game.  Featuring the best melee combat mechanics in an FPS I've seen since Jedi Knight II: Jedi Outcast and a satisfying arsenal of upgradable weapons and powers, you play through 17 chapters full of enemy hordes while following a surprisingly solid storyline. If you're tired of tropes of contemporary FPSes and yearn for the old days, then this is the game for you.  The gameplay through out the game was solid. Granted, the big arena style battles against hordes of enemies can get a bit repetitive, particularly on the higher difficulty settings where you might end up having to repeat the same sections after dying a number of times. Though it was the boss battles that I was slightly put-off by, as they were essentiallly all pattern-repeating bullet sponges, significantly less fun to fight than the hordes of low-level minions and mini-bosses.  There were a couple graphical optimization issues on launch. Most noticably, the animation on some of the cutscenes were rather janky. A few patches have been released since then, I'm not sure if any of the graphical issues I encountered still remain as I haven't played the game again since I finished it last year.  As an aside, I've noticed similarities between this and another new FPS based on an old series: Wolfenstein: The New Order, in that both games try to be revivals of old-school FPS gameplay albiet with some new features, but also seem to deconstruct the concept of the traditional FPS hero through the story.

However, in this glourious year 2014, very few things still impress us when talking about games. This new Shadow Warrior might not feel as good as Dark Messiah of Might and Magic or Deus EX, two games that are very apropriate to compare, but compensates with very good humour, sarcasm, fun to play, great mystic story (i didn't check it's originality) and probably the best sword play in a FPS. Actualy, in 90% of the battles I prefered to use the Katana rather than shooting weapons. The combinations that you can make with the sword won't make you look cool like Prince of Persia, but are very effective at slicing enemies in half quicker than you get to say cheese. The game lacks monster diversity (I counted 6 types of demons alltogheter), has no complexity whatsoever in solving puzzles and getting doors open and the only thing that makes you want to play it again is the nice sword play. I only recommend this game for the nostalgic people that remmember the previous titles from 3D Realms and have a taste for Wang's jokes",

The new one goes for a more tasteful route, and it works. The story is surprisingly interesting. I was expecting something more basic like the original, but it's impressive. There's twists and turns, and pulls you in. Your character, Lo Wang, is a refreshing action hero. He's a dynamic and likable tough guy with his own moments of laughter at his expense.  The sound is pretty solid. The music keeps up with the flow of gameplay well. The voice acting is remarkably good as well. And any game with the song 'The Touch' in it gets points from me.  It also looks great. There's some great variety with the levels and some nice details the models. The menus of the game also clearly had a surprisingly high amount of work put into them. My only complaint here is that the lip syncing for voice acting can be wonky at times.   The gameplay rocks. The sword-play made me believe melee can work in games by doing more than just clicking. Each swing's angle can copy the angle you move the camera or Lo Wang. It's fluid with a small learning curve. This game's a great example of older mechanics mixed with new ones in a good way. You have the frantic run-and-gun gameplay and complex levels of the past with modern polish. However, the difficulty suddenly spiking and disruptive glitches are rare but frustraing problems. Nonetheless, this game is amazing.    TLDR: One of the best First Person Shooters I've played thanks to great swordplay and old-school mechanics given a breath of fresh air. It's a 9/10 you should play!  ",

There are three settings you can choose for your sword which determines how precise your playing needs to be to get the sword to swing where you want. I can't recall a FPS with better melee combat than this.  You can upgrade the weapons (which saves the rather generic weapons from becoming too boring), learn new passive skills and some new actual powers. These include a kind of telekinesis, knock downs, more powerful sword strikes and an energy shield. The explanation for these abilities is that they use your ki. These abilities add a lot variety to the game and are much more fun than my description probably makes them out to be.  It's heavilly steeped in oriental theme and the humour is fantastic. Right from hearing the guys name is 'Wang' you know you're going to be in for a laugh. The dynamic between Wang and his partner keeps me smiling and some of Wang's one liners are classic. Complaining about FPS style puzzles or a particular cliche in a way that is almost fourth wall breaking. Very witty, very well done.  Its a fast paced all out action game reminiscent of the original. The odd door puzzle breaks up the pace but on occasion it breaks it at the wrong places creating a bit of frustration. Despite Shadow Warrior being much like older shooters (well it is a remake, at one time it was one of those) its fast pace and linear maps don't suit door puzzles. They feel like an artificial way to change the games pace and don't really fit, they just stop you in your tracks and that feels wrong here. In the original things were a little slower and more maze like, there was a point to door puzzles, it fit the gameplay. It doesn't here in most places. Enemy variety is a little lacking as well. If it were not for the super fun sword play and special powers these things would have killed the game for me. Also the boss fights on the insane setting are booooring! Hit point sponges that take an age to kill, otherwise it's a fun challenge.  There is no co op or deathmatch but don't let that put you off. It's a fun blast (or slash) that is now on my favourites list.",

It is somewhere halfway between a combo driven action game and an fps depending on how you play, but it is fun.  The level design is mostly gated, but the levels are big and have quite an amount of detail.  It is also as bloody as the first Shadow Warrior from the 90s, but then again, what do you expect from a game where the protagonist has a katana and the setting is demon invasion?  When it is on sale it is an absolute steal.  Also, if you are an older gamer, you know, one who bought Doom (2016) because you liked the first one when it came out in the early 90s, you will definitively have fun. I did for sure.  Update:   For eyefinity / crossfire users: Use the DX11 folder with the launcher.exe to launch the program. Otherwise crossfire won't work and you will get 20-30fps instead of 150+ in eyefinity (in case of a Radeon R9 295). Vsync will be a bit laggy, but disabling it will render the program working fine, and it looks better. Steam starts the usual exe.  Also, use the second difficulty, even if you are experienced with shooters. On the fourth difficulty, the first bossfight takes 25 minutes without dying. The second is ok and you should be fine.",

I had looked through my Steam Library and realized that I had lots of RPGs, strategy games.... thinking games.... but I didn't have any 'quick burst' games, games where I could sit down and play if I didn't necessarily have a few hours to burn or if I wanted some mindless violence. This led me to grab Hard Reset on sale, which I ended up liking quite a bit... and it also led me to grab Shadow Warrior. Not only is this a very good FPS; it also has GREAT melee combat, RPG-like upgrade system of your character, weapon upgrades, and it's REALLY REALLY funny. Like, actually laugh-out-loud stuff. Extremely long game for an FPS as well..... I'm maybe 30 hours in right now and I am fairly sure I am closing in on the end of the game.... sure beats those typical 8-10 hour FPS campaigns I'm used to. I know some people don't like games to 'outstay their welcome', but I figure that if I'm enjoying something I'd rather it go on for as long as possible. I never buy stuff that isn't on sale and this was no exception: i paid like a buck or two for Shadow Warrior.... but in terms of value this is a game that I'd be pretty confident recommending to someone even at full price. I've laughed a LOT (the intro movie is classic, the main character randomly quips some really choice comedy, and you keep finding fortune cookies that all have.... very interesting fortunes), the RPG-elements and upgrade systems mean you are always learning new skills and finding/enhancing new toys..... a no-doubter if you are in the need of a new FPS.",

It takes elements from the old school Shadow Warrior (Lo Wang, demon invasion, ♥♥♥♥ jokes) and puts an amazing new spin on it. With a multitude of weapons, skill buffs, chi attacks, references to the original pixel-gory game, as well as environmental hazards to use to your advantage this game keeps battles fresh and challenging with various onslaughts you must survive through. A roster of RPG-like advancements give Lo Wang your own personal advantages in battle, many of which giving a cosmetic change as well as efficiency.  In this lengthy gore romp Wild Flying Hog has not just given this 90's shooter a fresh coat of paint, but a complete overhaul to make it truly stand out from many other FPS's.",

Given that the original Shadow Warrior was a politically incorrect and juvenile doom clone from the late 90s, Flying Wild Hog was under no obligation to add substance, taste, or rewarding gameplay, yet somehow they did. I knew it would probably be enjoyable, but I didn't expect to enjoy it this much.  The gameplay is great, particularly the swordplay. Metal Gear Rising is the only game that I'd pick over this one when it comes to having a good time swinging a sword around. The production values are impressive as well. This is one of those games where it feels like the creators made the game they wanted and had a good time doing it. Weapons are pretty good. All firearms are upgradable and have an unlockable alt fire. You get some pretty interesting skills and abilities as well to help you in combat.  The story is a surprise as well. It's not going to compare to a series like Metal Gear, but the plot is far better than a game like this would be expected to have. After playing this, AAA studios like Guerrilla Games no longer have any excuse in my eyes for the poor stories that end up in their games.   The game is respectably long. 17 Chapters that will take you 10 to 16 hours depending on how much you explore and look for secrets. There's a new game+, which is good because I don't think it's possible to get all the upgrades in one go. There's also a Heroic mode with no quick saves or checkpoints in-between levels.  Flying Wild Hog should be extremely proud of what they accomplished here. I'll be keeping my eye on the studio as well as the publisher Devolver Digital.   Numerical score: 8.5/10 ",

Shadow Warrior is very repetitive, but at the same time incredibly fun. Even though I slaughtered wave after wave of the same exact baddies from about Chapter 5-17, I never got bored. I played on hard. It was difficult, but not punishing. I never played the original, but this really did feel like a classic 90s game in both attitude and gameplay. You'll experience a few larger-than-life boss battles. Every square inch of this game is jam-packed with ammo crates and explosive barrels. There are also a huge amount of secrets. I made my typical attempt to scour every nook and cranny of this game, but I still missed quite a few.   I spent $10 on this, and it was well worth it.

One might argue that some of the firearms in your arsenal are somewhat dull, but nobody cares since you are probably wielding your sword and using its powers 90% of the time, anyway. Game length is good, enemy variety is decent, the levels are created with a lot of attention to detail and overall graphically the game is quite a looker. Sound design and ambient music are of great quality aswell, with a few very memorable tracks and fitting voice actors.   The writing is pretty good and the story is surprisingly fleshed out for a game that is centered around dismembering demons.

So while it has hit points that don't regenerate on their own, it also has checkpoints all over the place. While you fight guys in big arenas and have to strafe, it also has dozens of upgrades to customize how you want to go about dishing out the pain. It has hidden secrets like we haven't seen since the 90s, but it also has some of the most beautiful landscapes and levels I've seen in any modern games. To be sure, this game feels the way we remember the classics playing back in the day in all the right ways.  Sure, the dialogue can be mildly offensive at times, but it's a sophomorish potty humor kind of offense, not a 'this guy goes home and beats his wife' offense. In short, it takes the weird sense of humor that made the original so great back in the day and brings it up to speed so that now it comes across as kind of charming in a weird sort of way.  The main character is younger and quite a bit more silly than the original deep-voiced guy, but the new one exudes a kind of easygoing, uncaring callousness mixed with an almost slapstick level of not understanding what's going on. He's got one-liners that, if they aren't misquoted from another source, should definitely be preserved for posterity.  Nothing is perfect, though -- the character movement can be a bit jerky when traversing over unsteady terrain; and the enemy animations often snap to one point or another rather than blending, which makes tracking them to pull of headshots a bit frustrating to be sure. But these are small complaints, and the fun of the overall experience definitely overshadows any minor technical concerns.  Let's put it this way, if the main character's name (Lo Wang) makes some part of you giggle just a little bit, this is probably the game for you. If you're tired of holding the left bumper to hide behind cover and you want to just get out there and make a mess, this is probably a good game for you. If violence and a quirky, crude sense of humor offend you, then how did you even get past the screenshots to bother looking at this review?",

The games visuals are stunning to behold, and even better if you have a better gpu than me, only running a gddr5 1gb 5750 ati. But the game ran incredibly well for the impressive boards they were showcasing. I'd also recommend playing this game over for speedruns sake, and just for the fun of hacking and slashing with your newly aquired abilities in the new game plus mode. And for a little more mayhem try the console commands to unlock the ultimate nobitsura kage that you get by the end of the game.

Remember when they tried to make a modern Duke Nukem? Hopefully not. But remember Shadow Warrior, the other 3D Realms shooter of a similar style but never made as much waves as Duke? Well the funny thing now is the modern iteration of the 'lesser Duke' game blows his recent outing right out of the water... and many others in the same genre today. Violent mass bullet storms against hordes of enemies, sure but what this game has is some of the best first-person sword play in a long time, the katana not only being more than a glorified batton like so many other shooter, it actually makes up the core experience. On top of the already impressive array of explosive firepower, the joy of slicing your foes in the meaty chunks never gets old. Take note developers, this is how you remake classic shooters.",

This game was responsible for me falling in love with PC gaming from the first day I built my gaming PC. I had not recieved my monitor in the mail yet so I hooked my PC up to my 4K tv and was blown away by this game. It is not very demanding so I was able to run this at 50 - 70 fps maxed out in 4k. I think I turned down AA to like 2x though. It was a few months ago so I cannot remember. Anyhow, I was impressed at how smooth of gameplay this has. The gun play and sword fighting is just nothing short of amazing. I wish this was one of those games that lasted 100 hours but I guess they would have run out of jokes for the fortune cookies had that been the case.   This game is worth your money at full price. It does go on sale from time to time so I would recommend waiting, but you will not regret the purchase regardless of how much money you give for it.",

SW will definitely provide challenge as the normal difficulty fights in the mid-game require some real tactics already.

Apologies if I come out the wrong way, but there is one thing that kinda irks me. It's the notion of constantly getting swarmed by demons and fighting your way to advance. Don't get me wrong, its a great mechanic, but I feel it's a tad overused. Still, I do enjoy killing hordes, so all good.  Lo Wang as a character is in my opinion better than Duke Nukem and Serious Sam (though I never fully gave either of those games a chance, so I may change my mind later on). He's a killing machine, pretty much like any other 3D Realms character. His puns are cheesy but effective, and he drives one of my favorite cars of all time (that being the Datsun 240z).  1 more thing. Fortune cookies. They are bound to make you smile.  Is it worth $39.99? In my opinion, no. Whenever it's on sale, get it then. Great game and I reccomend it to all. Don't forget to play the 1997 version as well!",

Want to solo the game with just the sword? Very doable.  - Interesting story, while somewhat different than the original (being a reimagining NOT a remake) it still kept things fresh with a few good twists and turns - Secrets! While i personally suck at finding them, coming across some things pointing back to the original game was pretty awesome, not to mention the extra goodies like being able to swap yoru sword for a variety of skins e.g. Hotline miami, Serious sam hammer and a few others - Good enemy variety and are generally quite intelligent as well - Good length for a Modern FPS, it took me about 10 hours or so to finish my 1st playthrough  Cons - Fall damage. I lost count of the amount of times i used shift to move quickly in a direction, fell and instantly died... it was not much fun haha - The game difficulty spikes hard in the last 3/4 of the game, there are SO many enemies that it almost felt like luck if i didn't simply get sandwiched and almost insta killed because there was so much stuff flying in my direciton (and this was on the 2nd difficulty)  - I got stuck not knowing where to go several times as, while there is good variety to the levels, having to sometimes backtrack made me get lost for a good while  I picked this game up for a couple of bucks from a Humble bundle, but i would definitely get this one even on sale, it's worth it =)",

It's still got the cheesey and crude boxes ticked, and that feels really outdated, but it's a nice nod to the orginal game, as are some of the other things you come accross like arcade machines of the original game, and secret retro areas. The swordplay is surprisingly fun, and actually handles really well. I thought it had quite a steep dificulty curve and I had no idea what I was doing at first, dipping in and out very irregularly, but once I got into it I really started to enjoy myself, and blasted through the last 2/3rds of the game in a couple of nights. On normal dificulty it was relatively challenging at times, but very generous with health, but I imagine playing it on hard could be pretty bad ♥♥♥. The story was even relatively well crafted and actually gave the game a decent pace and narrative which, considering the game makes a ♥♥♥♥ joke every other chance it gets, was perhaps the most suprising thing of all.

Secondly, THE COMBAT! The game has a heap of guns such as rocket launchers and smg's, but the swordplay is what makes this game special. Dashing up and around enemies to slice them in two, cut off their ankles or simple watch them head but the ground to kill themselves after you removed their arms, it's amazing fun! The weapons are very useful though, I often found myself switching to different weapons to take care of different obstacles (such as flying enemies or rolling mines).   I have many games I play but I don't often stick to a game to see it all the way through these days, but this one I had to, it was excellent and I very much recommend it.   9/10, well balanced, challenging and very entertaining.

            "review_text": "This game is a remake of the old 3D Realms game, Shadow Warrior - the Asian Duke Nukem. Whereas Duke Nukem was a parody of the 80s action movies, games etc, Shadow Warrior was a parody of the kung-fu movies.  Hell breaks loose, demons have come to our world and our hero, Lo Wang (save your jokes for later) has to find a magic sword and kick every demon's ♥♥♥ he sees.   As FPS go by, it has the best swordplay I have ever seen for this genre. You have total control of your sword, doing combos, slicing enemies' hands, legs, heads, torsos and using special moves to slash your way through, like charging your sword with Ki, doing a whirlwind attack, healing yourself, etc, The sword is your most powerful weapons. It kills enemies faster, doesn't cost ammo, is more fun slashing your enemy's limbs and better at your battle scoring (yes, it has the tedious style scoring, doing various stuff to get more points to get upgrades, having the obligatory RPG elements). While it has guns and such, you will need to buy upgrades with the in-game money to make them better, you will prefer the sword. You can also find crystals with which you buy Ki powers and their upgrades. And you gain Ki points, which are the XP basically and buy skills, for increased damage, increased HP, increased healing, etc.  It's also nice to see a FPS having big maps to explore, find money, ammo, and SECRETS!! Yes, ladies and gentlemen, secrets are back and they are more tedious to find than ever. The first chapter has eight secrets and believe me you will have found one secret and banging your head to where the hell are the rest. Also, you carry ALL of your weapons, not just the sword and say 2 more weapons. And like with the old game, you can use the demons' hearts and heads as weapons.   But it's not all fun and sunshine. First of all, this Lo Wag isn't as funny as the old Lo Wang. His jokes and manners are very tame compared to the 80s one, and kinda dry. The tried to make him kinda nerdy, by being a comic book collector, which buffled me a lot. Not to mention the demon spirit than accompanies Lo Wang is boring and aggravating, to the point of wishing he wasn't here at all.  Still, it's fun game and stands out from all the other FPS games that came out and try to be serious and bringing up morality and grey areas and such and being FUN for once.    ",

            "review_text": "A game I bought with few expectations, and now one of my favorite FPS experiences of all times.  Shadow Warrior is an old school FPS which, in my opinion, manages to get it all right.  The visuals are nice, with large levels filled with secrets, which environments varying from regular street, through mountains and ships, all the way to the shadow realm. Exploring the levels is fun and rewarding, and the 17 chapters offer a suprising amount of content considering modern FPS standards. The blood effects are also great, which is important because you will spend the game chopping off limbs and sinking tons of bullets into demonic flesh.  Which leads me to the action. Which is bloody (pun intended) amazing! Both the guns and the katana feel amazing, comlimenting each other, and with the addition of a small pool of magic spells and weapon skills, the combat offers a lot of variety. The game even encourages you to fight with a vide variety of moves by granting you additional, bonus upgrade points at the end of a fight based on how creative and fast you were. Enemy variety is ok, with only a few types being really annoying.  What surprised me the most was actually the story, which unfolds in two separate storylines. The main one is of Lo Wang and his quest to piece together the Nobitsura Kage and prevent the Shadow Realms from being destroyed, and the other, revealed through flashbacks each time you defeat a boss, reveals a rather tragic, and towards the end, surprisingly emotional, tale of why the Shadow Realm is falling apart in the first place. The flashbacks are presented as gorgeous 2D animations, and are a joy to watch. The story is carried by fantastic writing and even better voice acting. The main character is a jerk, but a badass jerk you just can't help but like. The dialogue between him and his companion demon Hoji is just fantastic, and his one-liners are some of the best I've heard in a long time.  Finally, I would like to touch upon one last brilliant element of this game. The fortune cookies. They are hidden in the levels, and the reward for finding them is 5 health restored and a fortune. These fortunes are amazing humorous takes on popular culture and well known sayings, each better than the last.  I honestly can't think of anything this game does badly. There are so many additional little details done right, of which there are too many to mention here, but as a whole, every moment is either action-packed, or funny, or even emotional. I was never bored or displeased, it's so much fun to play, and definitely worth the buy.  10/10",

The game tells two stories that are made one. One, being the story told as you the main chatacter which is full of hilarious over the top moments, and the other, which tells the legend that the story pulls from, and is shown in a beautiful art style through cut scenes. The graphics, the audio (both musical and other), the weaponry, the smoothness of gameplay, the dialogue, the cutscnes, everything, is mostly fantastic.

You'll be able to upgrade your skills and weapons throughout the game but it really doesn't drastically change how you play the game as much as I would've liked. The core style of gameplay throughout consists of wave based combat -- there's a lot of it. Despite the upgrade paths, don't expect an RPG FPS. This is a straight up wave based FPS action game with a story/campaign wrapped around it. When you're not doing that you're finding bunnies humping eachother along the way until the next wave of enemies show up. There's a lot of that too for no reason at all. The mileage on the humor may vary, it's pretty hit and miss.   Shadow Warrior is basically like Bad Boys II. Just when you think it's over, it keeps going. It doesn't know when to end until it finally does. It's fun but it overstays its welcome a tad too long for a game of this genre, imo.",

            "review_text": "This is a blast to play! Having played Hard Reset, I can say that Shadow Warrior has a similar approach, but, with a far more visceral combat, cutting demons left and right, with lots of blood and parts flying around.  It's really awesome! The starting weapons are rather overwhelming, but you'll get much more fun ones about 3 or 4 levels in. My personal favorite, as usual, is the bolt weapon. There's something really satisfying about impaling enemies in a bolt, pinning them against a wall and watching their members jiggle... Heh.  The Katana is also pretty great! You have directional attacks, and the dismemberment is really precise as well.  The levels are rather long, usually in the range of 40minutes to 1 hour. Still, you can Save at any time, so it's fine.  Lots of secrets and easter eggs to look for as well, many of them being throw-backs to the original Shadow Warriors. ... It also    features a demonic Monty Python rabbit.  . That can only enchance a game. Every game.  You'll be able to upgrade weapons and other special abilities, altough the upgrade system didn't seem particularly good, to me. Not that it's very important, anyway! The weapons don't start out bad, waiting for you to upgrade. Usually you upgrade to get additional forms of attack and whatnot, so it's fine.  The only thing that I didn't like at all was  one  aspect of the boss fights. They were really cool, usually multi-phase fights, where you fight enormous bosses, focusing on destroying a certain piece of armor, and then damaging it. They were really huge, which is awesome! The problem is simply that, after you destroy a piece of armor, you need to focus on it's weak point. But, even in their 'down' state, the bosses still move and attack, and often even block their weak point! Meaning that, even if you try to hit it, you'll often miss. Not to mention that those hitboxes are very weird, often not registering what seems a valid shot... So yeah. That's annoying! After a couple of seconds, the armor regenerates 100%, so you'll have to go through the same old song n' dance of shooting armor, and then missing the weak point miserably... It's infuriating. But other than that, the bosses were well designed and satisfying! Just he implementation that left a bit to be desired.  Two possible solutions are: instead of time before regenerating, perhaps a damage counter would work -- although it's rather artificial... the boss could be down for much longer (a balance of the two, perhaps?); the other one, which I prefer, would be not to regenerate the whole armor. It could come back, but it would take significantly less damage before breaking -- this would accelerate the fight, and not in a bad way, I'd say.    The other thing I'll mention is how some of the encounters felt really unfair! For the most part, the difficulty was great! I played the whole game in Hard Mode and, while challenging, it didn't feel frustrating. There were perhaps 3 or 4 encounters that threw too much at the player, especially the biggers, invulnerable enemies that you need to focus on a specific point/strategy to beat -- throw a few of them, and it's infurating, as you can't really focus on anything in particular. Especially in closed spaces, where you can't even maneuvre. But again, that rarely happened, so it's all good!   I almost forgot to mention: it's looks really, really good! The lighting effects are pretty nice, but what was very impressive was the mirroring effects. Water can reflect the game's environment, and there are also lots of crystal/glass effects that distort it -- it looks really awesome! Performance was good (solid 60fps) with the exception of fights with lots of dismembered enemies, where the physics could slow it down a bit.  Other than that, it has additional modes, including survival, new game plus, and an hardcore mode where you can't save, with a much higher difficulty.  There are 4 difficulty modes (+ plus harcore), with Insane above Hard. One minor complaint is that you can only do NewGame+ on the same difficulty that you've beaten the game with. So, having beaten the game on Hard, I can't start on Insane. I'm not sure if NewGame+ scales the difficulty up. Usually, I like to beat game on a difficulty, and do NG+ above that, to somewhat balance things.  But hey, all in all, Shadow Warrior is a really awesome FPS. Not much in the way of story, although it does have one, compensated by one of the most satisfying FPS gameplay around. Lots of cutting and exploding! I'd say I prefer Hard Reset's aesthetic -- and, to a degree, I really like the feel of its, althoughs it's more metallic pieces flying around than ... you know, flesh -- but they both excell at arena shooting, and certainly both achieve an almost perfect feel in 2 vastly different worlds. Definitely get both, if you like FPS!",

The game could be several hours shorter if the prolonging parts where you have to find the statues and destroy them to unlock the doors which appear EVERYWHERE LITERALY EVERY SINGLE LEVEL HAS IT. Not even mentioning how when you do finally find the statue you have to kill a horde of demons just to continue over, and over, and over. Dozens of times you have to do this. The whole fakeouts on the final combat stuff where the floor breaks so you have to continue with the grindy combat... not cool devs... not cool.

But the trouble with playing those old games is that graphics, level design and user interfaces have progressed so much since they were released that they often feel unbearably clunky compared to modern games.  Enter the new Shadow Warrior. It feels like this is the game that would have been made if modern graphics and sensiblilities had existed back in the days of Wolf3D, Doom, and Duke Nukem. This is a simple game, where your goal is only to survive hordes of enemies and find the key(s) that will let you progress to the next level. The levels are completely linear--if it appears that you have a choice of direction, then one of your two paths hold a secret waiting to be found. Your primary weapon will be the sword, though occasionally you'll switch to the old standards of pistol, machine gun, crossbow, shotgun, flamethrower or rocket launcher for convenience. You collect money, karma and ki crystals, which let you upgrade your weapons, stats and special abilities respectively.  By all rights this game should be boring. Yet I enjoyed it from beginning to end. It is simple, vulgar, politically incorrect, gorgeous, funny and thoroughly entertaining. It's best enjoyed in bite sized pieces of an hour or two. I paid $5 for it and wouldn't have felt cheated if I had paid $15. Don't pay more than that, though. I've become increasingly bored with modern shooters, but I fully expect to buy the sequel to this game when it goes on sale for $10 or less.

It's a fairly low-budget title, but they seem to have spent the money wisely and have done a good job overall.  I really like the main character, Lo Wang. It's hard to make a cocky ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ likeable, but they manage to give him enough flaws that he's actually pretty funny, several scenes in there are comedy gold. My favorite joke: 'I like my demons like I like my coffee: in puddles all over the floor'. To me, Lo Wang is the best part about SW, and their view on a ninja that has nothing to do with stealth and everything to do with looking cool is great.  The actual game play has good intentions and some good ideas but it never really gels that well. The main issue IMO is there is a lack of feedback to how the game mechanics work internally. Nothing exemplifies this more than the 'rating' you get after battles which is seemly chosen at random. There is also a lack of feedback on how you damage enemies, they often feel like bullet sponges as a result.  Despite this nit-picking these things also give the game a bit of character. I would much rather have a game with an unbalanced sandbox approach to mechanics like this than an over-designed game. The dash mechanic is also fun to use.",

The game offers traditional Japanese settings (from the temples and the castles to the mythology and the paintings), rich late 80's environments (from shipyards and inner courtyards to caves and snowy mountains) and a great collection of interesting guns. It may be only 9 in total yet I got more excited when I got the shotgun or the rocket launcher than I ever was finding any one of the bazzilion guns in BORDERLANDS 2.   Each type of enemy has different strengths and different weaknesses so you will have to try to figure out the best and quickest way to put them down. Each gun comes with three purchasable upgrades and augmentations. Zooming in is avalaible, no sniper rifle though, because this game wants you to be up close and personal.    The music is sublime, the dialog witty, the atmosphere mesmerizing, the hidden secrets will keep you exploring every nook and cranny (and try again and again to find your way to that impossible to reach bonus statue) and the story unfolds in twists and turns and double-crosses. And the ending will make you misty.  I know it is not fair to this epic game but it does bring to mind the game DAIKATANA should had been. See, Mr Romero, if you fail to get it right, someone else eventually will. And, boy, did they get it right!   HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",

This game is much closer to the school of Serious Sam/Painkiller arena shooters. Or Robotron in first person as I like to call them. Not that it is a bad thing, but don't try to find the intricate level design of Doom or Duke Nukem 3D because you won't find it here.  Even if the levels aren't very well design, they're arenas after arenas connected by some corridors after all, the game gets the most important thing in FPS's right. The combat. The guns just feel right (the crossbow is the spiritual sequel to Painkiller's Impaler) and enemies have this tendency to easily dismember.  While the combat is spectacular, it isn't a perfect game. The levels sometimes get repetitive, and there's not much variety of enemies. The boss fights aren't that interesting (all three are very much identical) and take too much time. Also, it's very common to get lost in the sameness of the levels, looking for that particular exit.  I still had lots of fun with this, mostly because there aren't that much games like this around. Or at least until Serious Sam 4 comes along, because Shadow Warrior 2 seemed to go into a slightly different route.",

The cool weapons become underpowered as the game starts to pile more and more fatties at you at any single point in time. The level design is dreadfully uninspired and boring. You run from point to point triggering the game's setpieces in order to spawn the various over-used enemies which the game throws at you in every chapter. In between the points, you will almost never find any enemies lurking or patrolling. The katana is the game's saving point, severing limbs and decapitating heads never gets old. However, the hit boxes for the larger sized enemies are a little wonky, so you might find yourself supposedly slashing at the back of the bugger, only to be disappointed that none of the hits registered.

The original Shadow Warrior is one of my most favourite games and hearing all them people masturbating each other with the 2013 Shadow Warrior by Flying Wild Hog being a 'true iteration', 'real old-school' shooter, I thought that it's a sure bet to get it.  Jesus Christ, this game is so disappointing it gave me the biggest blue balls ever. From trailers and quick glimpses at some short gameplay videos I thought I will indeed get a somewhat classic shooter.  Hardly. It's a game trying to be a classic shooter, but not doing the most basic thing required from the 1st gen fps game - a proper level design. It's a Painkiller of 2013, which had the same problem. The level design in this game and everything involved (weapon pacing, resource management, combat) sucks. It sucks so much, that there's no reason at all to play this game more than the first few levels, because every single level in the game is the same. A corridor - an arena that limits you in space, where a fight accurs - a dialogue and tedious looting for cash. Rinse and repeat. Yawn. It has nothing to do with anything that made the original a classic game. I've played, like 8 hours now, and every single level (except the Gozu fight) was exactly the same. Run in circles and shoot HP bloats (and I do mean HP BLOATS). After the few first arenas it grew old to me. I can't push myself to finish it, although I really wanted to like this game. The terrible gun-play and wild design decisions don't help, either. For the first few hours we're stuck with a powerful katana sword and an useless revolver, a weak-♥♥♥ handling smg you have no reason at all to use. Later you get a crossbow that covers half of the screen, and much, much later you get a shotgun that's basically useless against hordes of enemies you encounter. I've just put my hand on a rocket launcher that covers, like, 2/3 of the screen. What? I didn't even use it in the fight that took place right after I had picked it.  Ah, there's a flamethrower you won't ever use. Every weapon except the katana with its combos feels underpowered, because every single enemy is a massive HP bloat. You will put many, many, many magazines and rockets into a single warlord. There're no tactics, no resource management, no real level play involved due to combat pattern that follows a simple 'lock a player in an arena and spawn enemies'. Secrets are mostly useless cash bonuses and Karma bonuses (in-game currency for passive and active skills) with occasional cheap nostalgia gimmicks. They don't benefit you in a way original's secrets used to (you can get a granade launcher 30 seconds into the first level). In 2013 version you have nothing. And there are your Ki powers. A simple katana combos are pretty neat. For first three times you use them. But the healing power is just a game-breaking issue. You can heal up yourself up to above 100 HP after investing karma into passive HP skills. You can get second winds, enrages after getting below 30 HP, etc. There's no suspense, no challange at all in this game. Only tedious gunplay versus HP bloated enemies. I don't think you could miss more with making a true Shadow Warrior game than Flying Wild Hog did with their game.",

Now, I noticed I said 'almost' every other word in a 30 sec rant I posted earlier and its clear that just doesn't describe this game enough. The game is a first person hack and slash shooter that has a simple story, has fun simple combat, and it can be funny. In fact, I really enjoyed the game up to chapter 9. The levels that felt like 10 mins but were at least a half an hour long, were now an hour and felt like an eternity. The enemies were challenging, varied, and fun to dice up until you have to deal with Spearmen, Shamen, and Warlords in the same room after room which to be honest felt really annoying after a while. In fact, it feels like padding to make the game seem longer. The levels originally were pretty open with enough space to dodge and see where you are going along with any story driven object you need to activate, but I swear from Ch.9 onwards they threw that out the window. The levels become very cramped and narrow which leads to my cheap deaths from literally everything exploding on the screen, getting stuck on something from the environment, or falling down the stairs to my death because...reasons I suppose. The weapons do what they do for the most part, though I believe the flamethrower was absolutely useless, the upgrades actually make you feel more powerful like they should. Their jokes start off strong but die after a while from being repeated too often or just cringe worthy.   To be blunt, if this game was shorter, possibly 12 levels instead of 17, or had more dynamic fights with open fields I probably would say this is a great game but it's not. At best I would say its a good game and sadly that's just not good enough for me. I really wanted to enjoy this game since I enjoyed Devolver Digital's other games like 'Not A Hero'. I hope if and when I play the sequel I will be able to say its a great game.   _______________________________________________________________________________ Old review| I think the easiest way to describe this game is...almost. It is almost really freaken good, It is almost really funny, it is almost really difficult but fun, and its almost fun to move around Terrain. Almost. The first 8 levels of the game I found really, like really fun, but as soon as I got to chapter 9...everything changed. I suddenly grew extremely tired fighting the same waves of enemies over and over, everytime I went down the stairs there was a good chance I would die to fall damage through either sprinting or an enemy pushing down them, also I was in a fight I had to be really carefull not to blow myself up due to everything being explodable in a small cramp space. The jokes from chapter 9 on became really cringe worthy or they would repeat. I think what makes this so fruastrating is that this is ALMOST really good but it is not. I really wanted to enjoy the game.",

These elements collectively drag down the flow and leave a mess of a game behind, which is unfortunately in this case Shadow Warrior.  Shadow Warrior tries to be a competent shooter and succeeds in that regard but is bogged down by far too much to be worth the effort. At first glance there seems to be a variety of weapons and skills, which can be tailored to the way one wants to play. But the variety comes across rather dull with the tedious weapon upgrade system and the woefully small amount of enemies you actually end up fighting. The enemy behaviour is mediocre at best and downright annoying at worst. Some of the skills and upgrades and completely useless make no sense in context, and a majority of the weapons are not as powerful as we've come to expect, the flamethrower and crossbow in particular.  Moving on from what Shadow Warrior is about, we come to what it's not; the story. In a game that already has a flow so broken, why it felt it needs to have overlong stylised cutscenes and such a heavy focus on the characters, it ends up having many of them with odd behavior and no motivation, with the protaganist being my primary example here. None of the 'witty' remarks made by Lo Wang or his pocket demon are funny, with the humour coming from the fortune cookies you pick up, which are secret items in themselves and have to be sought after to be found.  Speaking of secret items, there are phrases, names, and even sections of the game which reference other games, which breaks the immersion when you notice how out of place they are. As a close reletive to the Duke Nukem games, I can see how this practice would come about, however it obviously didn't learn from Duke Not Finished on how those references aren't funny. Most jarring of all are the arcade cabinets.The aesthetic does feel rather inconsistent at times, although the environments move fluidly from city to docks and underworld to mountains. In addition to that, the levels themselves are breathtaking near the end of the game with the second boss fight being the most memorable part of the game.  Overall, I'm giving this game a thumbs down. The fun and memorable moments of the game are soured by the long and dreary sections between them and the irritating gameplay which just doesn't feel worth the effort. It's not a terrible game, more of a disappointment due to my excitement prior to playing it. For the base asking price, you'll be getting more irritation than it's worth, which is never a good thing.",

The main flaws in this game start small then become larger as you progress further in the game, and it's honestly just personal nitpicks of mine that really discouraged me from playing any further without being more annoyed. Sure the game may look pretty, and may have its moments but it wears thin later on. When I first started playing the game, I noticed some sort of weird jittering movement the protagonist was doing and I tried to find the answer and to no avail there was none. Supposedly, the game doesn't agree with certain video cards despite yours being high end. That, or the game was oddly coded that the ground feels like rugged terrain and Wang is tripping over himself on the floor repeatedly.  Second was the enemies in this game, I didn't mind it at first. In fact I was playing with the sword through the quarter of the game with all the hype in the world dismembering demons, but things started to come into view when I was doing that. The sword isn't that great later on, and the whole 'combinatinos of sword swipes' doesn't really matter at all. If the enemy is blocking, you won't hit them. You can't break their block unless you use a Ki technique, and if you do that enemies will become enraged, zerg rush you, and won't give you much time to react. That's not the worst of it unfortunately, as later on when you keep playing you realize the sword becomes a hinderance late game. An ability that can hit enemies far away isn't reliable at all, so you have to use a gun if you want to progress further. You may ask 'Why should that matter?' Well, the guns aren't good either. You're stuck with the pistol for a good while, the shotgun is terrible, and the uzi is just pure garbage.  Nothing shines unless you upgrade them, and all the upgrades are pretty much useless. Yeah you can dual wield Uzis, but that will waste ammo that you need. The only real good weapon is the rocket launcher, and not because it clears faster because it's the only damn weapon that does significant damage to anything. You'll be stuck on a boss for a long time unless you use the rocket launcher. That is if you hit their weak spot to reveal their real weak spot to even do any damage to them at all. Which leads to my third issue with the game. The enemies.  This game loves to test your patience, so be ready to go through every single room and be forced to clear it out everything in there to progress. Because it'll be a lot of them, at first it won't be much but trust me when I tell you that the amounts get larger and more annoying. When you run out of ammo and have to stab at flying enemies with your sword it becomes apparent that this game really wants you to do either three things; use your sword, burn your ammo, use the crappy gun. As I said, the enemies become more annoying in this game as you progress because it will throw these lets call them super demons at you all the time. First not so much, but late in the game there WILL be a lot of them. You might think it's not a problem, but it really is since three of them are made to be the most inconvient time consuming monsters in the damn game.  They have boss like health almost, take forever to take down unless you want to spam rockets or try spamming your Ki attacks. One will always pull you in unless you chop his arm off, and his ranged attack can ignore corners. Another enemie will spam skeletons, which will continue to spawn forever unless you kill him and add more to the twenty demons in the room that you have to kill. Oh and they become invulnrable unless you kill the skeletons sometimes too. Then there is the icing on the cake of annoying super demons, the ones that you have to hit in the back to hurt in a certain spot. The hitboxes for that one spot is so stupid that you have to get it just right. Otherwise, rockets or any explosives will ignore the damage so it's just better to try hitting them in the back with melee or bullets. However, doing so is a huge tedious process since you have to correctly get them to stun themselves or you won't be able to.  Oh, and the puzzles in this game are annoying. Expect door puzzles to increase too, you have to get Shrine A, B, C (Sometimes all three) to open one single door only to be brought to another. Wouldn't be a problem if I didn't have to clear every single damn room to progress to the next one and kill more super demons just to open one damn door only to be introduced to another god damn locked door. Jokes are very mediocre, I don't mind the protagonist's personality or his sidekicks but the whole comedy of the game is very weak and not that hilarious. Nostalgic value? Eh, it's alright but I really can't recommend this unless you can get it for much cheaper.  /endranting",

FX6350 3.9Ghz/4.2ghz and RadeonHD 7950 - This system is well above the needs of this poorly graphically desgined game (seriously low graphics for 2013 but I don't care about that, I only care about gameplay - saying this because it doesnt make sense on my machine that this looks like crap.) Game runs at about 80-110 fps but looks like utter ♥♥♥♥ unless it's running at 120fps solid (i don't understand why this is) - when I turn on vysnc it runs at 60 which is what i want as i use a 60hz monitor but it looks like a game running below it's intended frame rate = extremely jittery. If they find a way of ironing this out it would be a great game but it is unplayable in it's current state on my machine - which runs Battlefield 4 / Tomb Raider on High at 60fps solid and Ultra with an average of 55fps, 2 much more demanding games than this. I have checked the internet for a fix to this problem for this game but despite numerous people complaining of this (on both Nvidia and AMD cards) there is no fix and doesn't seem to be any effort from the developer to release a fix.   From what I have been able to play the gameplay is great fun, very good fun, comically violent and bloody - good chinese martial artsy feel despite the guns but is held back by the fact it is unplayable on my machine. Let me re-itterate - on a 60hz monitor this game has to run at 120fps solid to actually not look jittery, a 7950 is not a weak graphics card and it cannot run this at 120fps solid, about 100 yes but I am not kidding - any less than 120 and it looks like a game intended to run at 60fps running at 30fps - very, very choppy and jittery.",

I really wanted to like this game and play it to the end. The first few hours were very fun; unlocking equipment, learning new skills, and becoming a total badass was awesome. But then it stopped. I stopped having fun, the game was pushing to much and trying way to hard to keep my attention. I was so bored. After most of the move sets were available, and the same enemies just kept coming in the same repetitive manners. The story WAS interesting, the jokes WERE funny, and the combat USE TO BE fun.",
