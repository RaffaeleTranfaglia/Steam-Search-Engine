            "review_text": "Don't be turned off by the rough-edged models and simple graphics. This game is wild fun, and when you're in the heat of the action, it's exhilirating. These shipdeck battles feel like the best parts of Wind Waker crossed with the best parts of The Matrix. The game may be a one-trick pony, it has no exploring or adventuring mechanics beyond the battles themselves (for now), but it does that trick extremely well and I always feel giddy after a battle, regardless of whether I won or died.  I do think and hope that some aspects of the gameplay will improve over time:  - Loading screens are so 5 years ago. SInce you're mostly just standing on the same part of the same ship, when you sail out for a new battle, why not just have the ship sail away from port? To me that would greatly improve the feeling of immersion. - The challenge island and sword battle are exciting new elements and I hope that they get more fleshed out over time. I'd love to be able to wander around an island and stumble on an ambush, talk with a few different traders, search for buried treasure, etc., rather than simply being dropped into fight scenes.",

The two Vive controller mechanic for aiming the rifle is interesting but without the controllers being physically connected still does not feel right. Like so many other Vive games out right now this one feels like an interesting idea but no where near a game worth $5 let alone $16.",
