As a cockroach I got the chance to run around and make my friends and brother (depending who was person) frustrait trying to find me and my other cockroach companions. The task is simple as a little bug, eat til you pop out an egg. Make sure it pops out hidden but yet fair enough to be found. Plant enough eggs without the human breaking them and all of adult roaches and you win!  As human, task is simple, SMASH!!!! Kill every bug you see til you make their lives go too zero! Use anything you can! Pans! Knives! Sppoooooons!!!!!   Once you kill all the Roaches 10 times each for each roach. If the eggs are still alive you must kill them too win.  Great, simple, game would recommend to play this game if you have friends to play with.",
