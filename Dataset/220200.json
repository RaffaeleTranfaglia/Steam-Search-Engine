It is not a simulation by any means, but that doesn't mean you won't still learn a lot about rocketry, and the things which NASA and the folks who fly in those crazy contraptions have to deal with.   The Community as well is extremely nice, and extremely active. With a mass amount of mods for the game, which allows you to really customize it to your liking (Much like Elder Scrolls games are).   On top of that, they are also moving it to Unity 5 (If they havn't already at the time you're reading this in the future), meaning the limitation on mods will be quite literally... limitless.   That with Multiplayer to boot! (Coming Soon as well with Unity 5).   -----------------------------  The game itself has 3 modes.   Career: Which pits you against your mind. Balancing income from successfull missions, reputation, and science. Failed missions could cost you big, and learning how to create a more cost friendly ship to do the same job could save you bundles. Use Science to unlock new parts on the tech tree, to push your exploration even farther.   Science: Same as Career but without the reputation and Money.   Sandbox: Like all Sandboxes.. Everything is tehre from the start, no money, science or anything else, Just build and have fun.   -------------------------------  What you do in the game is open ended. IT's your choice. Build what you want, and fly it anywhere you want (Or anywhere it can go). There are many many entire different planets to explore, moons, asteroids, etc. A fully open ended solar system.   Taking off from Kerbin, flying through the upper atmosphere, and breaking through into space is seemless and a wonderful excitement when you do it for your first time without the ship exploding.   From there, going to another planet, landing anywhere you want on it and exploring it, then coming back and hoping you have the right trajectory to burn safely through the kerbin atmosphere as flames fly up around your ship.. epic.    5 Tests launching rockets that failed: 2,000,000   Launched a rocket to the Mun, but couldn't return: 400,000 + 1 stranded Kerbal   Attempted a rescue Mission with the same result: 450,000 + another stranded Kerbal   Finally reaching the Mun, and returning back safely in the water: Priceless",

While I play numerous others (such as Farming Simulator) they don’t seem to hit every mark in that field. KSP, while challenging at first is the one that throws everything that happens in reality at the player, and force them to deal with it. While a game like Farming Sim only really requires you to keep an eye on fuel or some crops, KSP requires that you maintain a healthy supply of necessities ranging from fuel and electricity, to a satellite connection back home. But the part of the game that truly shines is the feeling you get when you first land on the Mun. A friend who gave the game a shot said   Originally posted by  Bacaber :",

KSP is walking the fine line between a space sciency simulation and a comicly slapstick just for fun and giggles game.  Its harsh and unforgiving in the beginning, expecting you to know about the basic science of rocketry or fail over and over until you get it on your own. (Watch ScottManley tutorials if you want a head start)  I had trouble in the beginning even getting into orbit around the planet (or keeping my rocket upright on the way there) - but now I am planing missions to other planets, landing and returning - sending unmanned rovers to explore - or even bringing asteroids back home.  800 hours in and I feel like I am still just at the beginning.  »Mün or bust« - unknown (prob.

Besides, if someone wants that Buzz Aldrin's Space Race is available for sale on Steam.   Instead, you get better at the game. You develop an understanding of Newtonian Physics - more than you ever thought you would. You build massive rockets and undertake interesting expeditions.

            "review_text": "What starts out as a simple, often hilarious; almost lego-like rocket/spaceplane builder has an astounding depth when you look into the possibilities.   The game features a great incentive for advancing your ambitions, science. Science is spent on new technology and parts for bolder missions, and is earned by pushing your boundaries. First, you can explore around you. Take samples, and crew reports from your cute crew of little green simpletons, then maybe you take a simple rocket to outer atmosphere for the first time, take a crew report and get home alive with a nifty parachute.. and Bam! More science. A new part, and the plot thickens..  KSP begins as a goofy tinkering tool with rockets and develops into a full-blown space exploration and research SIM. Getting a rock sample from the moon may be one of your hardest gaming achievements, as it was for me, but doing it brings reward like little else. The planning, the development and trial/error makes KSP a great learning tool. It's even NASA approved. It uses real world physics and simulated drag for winged aircraft. It uses realistic orbital-mechanics for planitary manuevers, and players use realistic many real-life elements mission planning.   Buy it for your kids, buy it for yourself. They'll enjoy goofing and experimenting; they might even get serious about it. Same goes for you; you will enjoy at least a few experimental flights/missions. Especially if they end in a giant explosion, as many early flights will. After that you might have a success or two, maybe a simple contract or research mission turns out to be easy and you start learning. Soon you'll have dreams of the stars.  *****",

            "review_text": "After playing for 72 hours...  The funnest part of this game, is building the rockets of any design I can think of, testing them. (Go to launch... topple over and go boom... darn it, try again...) The graphics are pretty good. Some reason the crew is hard on my system when building the crafts, had to turn them off.  One thing I do not understand is why your craft is desroyed even when hitting water at 5m/s via parachute, only thing to survive is the cockpits. (not a game breaker, just know the water is off limites in the game)  ... Patience is required while playing ... It takes a long time to get across the oceans to land your craft at desired locations. You have to be careful when using the speed up if flying a plane. It can cause you to loose/gain altitude without touching the controls.  The arodynamics of the game are increadable. Durring one of my missions, altidude required for testing an item had put me in space, I managed to test it, but was out of fuel, and still orbiting, I almost restarted but chose to see if the close path was close enough to barely skim the atmosphere, and sure enough, angled the heat sheild to push the module deeper into the atmosphere, reducing orbit considerably, the next pass was slow enough to actually stay in the atmosphere, again, angled it to push it in deeper. The angle was so good, I was able to open the chutes at about 1900m and land on top of a mountain.  Neucances of the game, the physics engine does something strange, causing the ship to stop flowing with the rest of the system, the ship dangles there, it's orbit doesn't move, but the planet does, if left alone long enough, the orbit no longer orbits the planet, but the ship still hangs there. Other times the ship suddenly disintigrates right after a 'warp time' menuver. More than one occation on a load, the vessel is well belloe the 0m mark, on water it breaks the ship into pieces, and only specific pieces float to the surface. On land, only the pieces that register as above 0.000m is not instantly destroyed. These sorts of things make it difficult to play career mode. Occational crash to desktop, without known reasons, sometimes it says it has crashed, and to tell them about it, yet doesn't say what to do with a folder. I got the game through steam, will be nice when they have an update to fix known bugs. (Even so, I still recomend the game.)  .... Bottom Line ... I am enjoying the game. Devs keep up the great work.",

            "review_text": "I have much more hours in this game, I bought it before it was even on Steam.   Kerbal Space Program is a space-agency simulator where you control the agency itself and the actual Kerbonauts (astronauts). There are three gamemodes, career (you manage the actual agency with funds, popularity/approva, and research tech), science (same as before but just research) and sandbox with no limitations but there's almost no agency mechanics. Although because of that sandbox may sound like a lesser mode, the agency mechanics are really secondary.  The main gameplay is being the actual Kerbonauts and performing the mission, which you yourself can determine or you can take a contract. However building the rocket (or spaceplane) is just as important as actually flying it. There's a whole solar-system for you to explore, complete with asteroids and moons for some of the planets. Some of the planets even have irrational orbits, and some of those have moons with an irrational orbit to the planet. The game is realistic enough to be somewhat educational but loose enough to be a very fun game.   The game is somewhat difficult due to the loose-realism, but that is a good thing for myself. I'd rather a game be too hard (this game definitely isn't) than be too easy. Everytime I start a new save, I learn something new along the way everytime. Whether it's a more efficient way to get into orbit, faster way to dock, or even a way to use less parts for a rocket. I always learn something new, and I love that.   Also, KSP is one of the few games ever to exit early-access and actually be complete with no major bugs. That's dedication.",

Flight combat sim: install realistic aerodynamic mod and weapons mod to make your own F15s fight your own Su-27s (FAR and BDarmory).   Colony building: there are life support and resource collecting mods that challenge you to scan for the right site and use resources on any of the planets to sustain a colony of kerbals; even manufacture new parts there (MKS, TAC lifesupport, extraplanetary launchpads, scansat, remotetech).   Hardcore realistic simulation? Theres a mod that converts the stock star system to a 1:1 scale replica of the solar system, with real-life satellite data used (real solar system, realism overhaul, probably more mods - these are too scary for me). Realism overhaul I think uses historical rocket data so you can create saturn-V replicas with the accurate fuel mixtures and everything!   Or go the other way and get futuristic mods to create antimatter powered near-light speed craft to visit entire other solar systems (nearfuture, KSPinterstellar)!   And with the new 1.1 release on Unity 5, you may actually be able to use these mods without running out of memory!

You\\'ll spend a half an hour building a spacecraft and making sure its 100% set and ready to get put into orbit and complete its objective. Then you\\'ll get to launch and control your craft through the atmosphere and into the galaxy laid out before you. Two moons orbit your planet, more planets lay beyond yours, each with different gravity and temperatures and atmospheres.  If you want a game about space and building your own craft and controlling them? Do it. SO worth it. I\\'ve even found making my own jets and flying within the atmosphere fun and educational all in one. If you have a creative kid, or one who loves spaces? Do it.  It has a sandbox mode, build and fly whatever you want, or you can take on missions and slowly proceed through the various parts and completing different objectives.  Downsides? Only jets for inner atmosphere, no propellers in the vanilla game (with mods you can get some, but they aren\\'t 100%), no submarine crafts to my knowledge, but \\'water craft\\' and seaplanes... errr seajets are able to be made.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.  The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit, yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.  It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience.

I utterly love this game and the fact that i can go from building interplanetary colony ships to a jet powered boat that can break the sound barrier.

So a tl;dr for those of you who are lazy :P  Pros: - Sandbox environment where you can explore an entire solar system - Fully simulated physics, in atmosphere and in vacuum - Amazing modular rocket/plane building - Constant support from dev team - Extreme amount of content for price - Modding support - Amazing community - KERBALS!  Cons: - Runs in 32 bit causing instability issues, especially when running mods  So all in all i honestly rate this game 9.5/10",

They have my full support and they, unlike others on steam, have never let me down.  Now for the review: This game is amazing, your in charge of your own space program, and, if you wish, can manage cash, research, reputation, and so on, to hire better crew, purchase new parts (through a tech tree) and explore the great solar system of Kerbol (the Sun, for us humans). this solar system is mutch like ours, with a few differences (more moons here and there, and less moons there and there, etc).   Its a great physics space game that dosnt ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t you. You have all the tools (almost, still waiting for the Canadarm and so on) that real space programs have IRL, and with them do what so many dreamed of doing, massive space stations, colonization of other planets, mid trip refueling from planets (this was one of the major reasons why water on Mars was a great discovery, its not all about life, its also about using planets as stepping stones. I could write pages and pages of the features you get with this game but that wouldnt exactly be a review.  If you want, u can also just have all the stuff there in sandbox, which is also fun, but more daring players will want the extra challenge; to see the potential of every indvidual part. THHIS game, my freinds and Frenemies, is amazing, and its worth its price, which for what it offers most would call a bargin, and you will NOT regret buying this game.   Congratualtions, Devs of KSP and everyone else at SQUAD. You guys are the best, thank you for the amazing game, and we all look forward with great excitment to the next patch, as we have since early acces :)",

HOURS OF FUN!  A Whole Star System to Explore..Planets, Moons, Asteroids, Sun, ETC...  Graphics are kinda simplified, and it is 32 Bit based, but the game is still a blast!  Things the game devs could improve on...  1. Texturing could use some work, easy to spot patterns. 2. Could make modding easier for the community 3. Could make modding tools specifically for the game, My favorite mod tools to date are Blizzards Starcraft Modding SDK. 4. MORE PARTS 5. More Star Systems 6. WormHoles/StarGates/Hypertunnels 7. Comets and other space debris 8. More Structures and things to do on Kerbin and Other planets. 9. Better, Active Skybox / Nebulas, SpaceStorms, ETC.  --More suggestions to come!--",

Keep in mind that building something that massive isn't just uneccissary, it makes it extremely hard to do anything, so don't let that turn you off. By the time a new player is able to builld a 400 part ship they'll likely have the update out anyway. And for anyone looking for a great first stage should look up how to Asparagus.   Edit- Notice how all the negative reviewers have 200+ hours. So for $30 you get rediculous amounts of playtime and yet you can't reccomend it. That is really foolish and petty. And now they are taking ♥♥♥♥ for slow updates from the whole community. THIS GAME IS COMPLETE. Any further updates are just proof that they are happily commited to making the best possible product, and the 1.1 update will allow massive ships, I'd imagine that upgrade takes time.

            "review_text": "Do not let the number of hours I have playing KSP on Steam fool you. I have done over 1000 hours playing KSP with mods. That cannot be achieved with the stock game on steam.  Ok, so, do I recommend this game? Yes and No. Do I love this game? I DO!  At first glance, anyone that does not know much about it, look at the funny videos of kerbals (those little green guys) and some nice pics of space stations and so on, and think: 'another stupid kids game'. That could not be farther from the true.  Be aware that I play this game since alpha, and many bad critics here are old and while the game was in develop.  This is a hard game to master, its fun, its frustrating, its amazing rewarding when you achieve some hard contract or when you set up your own goals.  Forget space has you know it! No aliens, no space combat, no warpdrives (mods ;) ) nothing like that. This is a pure space game with physics (almost real) with real physics solar system.  You will learn how to fly a rocket or a space plane, get it into orbit, make a transfer to the moon (mun in kerbal language) land (read crash) and visit other far away planets. While doing this, you must take into account, fuel, weight, for each stage while you launch your rocket into the air until it reaches space.  Play sandbox mod and do your thing, or play in career mode and go from there.   So if my critic is all about saying good of KSP why did I say that I do recommend it and not? Well, if you do not have the feeling for space in a newton manner, if you do not grasp at least how things behave in space or, in this case, how to fly something in space, if you do not know anything from physics with low G and the notion of gravity, then go play something else.   KSP is all about the chanllange of building something and trying to achieve something. There are many terms people use in game, this from the Astronomy, engineering and so on. So, in fact, you do not need to be a rocket scientist, but it helps! :P  The community is amazing, I never saw so many people dedicated to one game like KSP. NASA even toke notice of KSP and decided to sponsor the game for education pourposes.   KSP is on of those true gems that I am glad I own and love it. In KSP the challange is you and your goals, and the more you know about KSP, the more you understand it, the more challenging it will become just because you always want more and do more complex and difficult things.  Add mods to the game and be prepared for some really true amazing experiences in space. The community has a huge selection of mods that are constantly updated to make the game more silly or more real, you choose. Me? I prefer the cold hard reallity of space, where your life, in this the Kerbals lives, are in your hands. From mods that give you life support, mining, radiation and heat problems in space or caused by friction, you have mods for everything.  This is one of the most fun games I have played in about....10 years. And I do play some great games not all in steam. I love space games, from Elite, to the X series, Eve online and even startrek online. This had nothing to do with all those games. This is a 99% pure space simulator where you are the boss. Well, you do run a space program you know? Try to do better them NASA ;)  If you like me, do buy this game.",

On a more serious note, this is an all round great game, for people who want to make explosions and people who want to engage in dangerous missions to distant planets alike. The art style itself is cartoonish, whilst maintaining a fair amount of realism. The UI is also very well designed.  Gameplay is fun, whether it's building a 200 part asparagus staged rocket, flying a bizarre ion powered SSTO or trying to get Jeb to the Mun using only an EVA suit. With the randomness of the game, even a routine mission to low orbit can be a disaster, keeping the game ftom getting repetitive.  My only complaints are going to have to be the chosen engine, which I can hardly complain about because a good Unity game will take full advantage of it.

There are a lot of reviews on this game, some say how it's super difficult... and others say how rewarding and challenging it is. That's what most of them sound like, but what I'm going to do is review the kind of person that loves KSP. Kindof like a psychological evaluation.  For each question, answer 1-5 with 1 meaning 'this doesn't sound like me at all' and 5 meaning 'this is all me all the time'. 1) I enjoy 'fiddling' with something until it works 2) I science all the things. 3) I enjoy building contraptions. 4) I like big explosions and going *really* fast. 5) I enjoy a challenge. 6) I like simulation/management games where decisions involve risk/reward tradeoffs. 7) I prefer sandbox style of play.  If you score anything over a 20, or if you're still curious anyway (worth at least 20 points by itself) read on. This game is fantastic just plain vanilla.  ***however*** The mods and community make it infinitely better. If you take a look through the mods on the KSP forum, you'll find something you enjoy. Also, CKAN (comprehensive kerbal archive network) is a tool you can download that will find, list, and manage your mods for you. It's easy to use.  Types of mods depending on the game *you* want to play: -Just like building and flying but hate mathing? Use Kerbal Engineer Redux and read up on dV requirements. -Rather build ships and manage your space empire without worrying about piloting? Use MechJeb. -Want to manage colonies? Use MKS/OKS for all your kolonization. -Want to make it more difficult? This list is endless... life support mods, mods that add random malfunctions, mods that increase the scale of the world, etc -Want to shoot stuff from your shiny new plane or orbital bombardment satellite? Lost of weapons mods are available. -Want to reenact old missions? There are recreation mods and 'stockalike' mods galore, also remote-tech mod. -Want to build crazy contraptions?

Kerbin has the same gravity as Earth, and despite the cartoonish green heads and stupid grins on the faces of the Kerbals, (and unusually high survivability), you actually launch (nearly) realistic NASA style missions, with some simplified physics thrown in.

You may even end up accidentally learning in depth about Dealta V and orbital mechanics, and while you CAN perfectly design missions to be efficient and elegent, brute forcing your way through with more boosters, fuel and struts is always an option.  Your successes will actually feel like a huge achievement (landing on the Mun for the first time for one), and all your failures will (usually) be peppered with huge explosions, so even failure feels surprisingly fun.

For those who are unaware, Kerbal Space Program is basically a game that uses realistic physics in an ingame solar system. There really is no goal for the player, save maybe to get to other planets. The player has at their disposal, many different rocket parts, as well as plane parts (for those aero enthusiasts such as I) to do, well whatever they want. There are three different game modes, Career, Science (!), and Sandbox. Career mode places the player in control of the Kerbal Space Center (or KSC) and your goal is to complete contracts and get to other planets. You have to balance your budget, while at the same time getting enough science to unlock new parts. Your buildings also have limitations, such as the launch pad only being able to launch rockets that are say 15 tons. As you progress, it is necessary to upgrade these building to bigger and way more awesome vehicles. In Science (!) mode, you begin with every building at the highest level, and without the worries of balanceing your budget (fancy way for saying there is no money), and your only goal is to launch missions and get science to unlock more parts. Finally there is sandbox mode. For those gamers out there unfamiliar with the term, sandbox is generally used to refer to a gamemode in which everything is unlocked, and you may run wild. That said, in this gamemode, you may run wild. There is no goal whatsoever and you have everything in the game. I play the game while running mac OS X El Capitan (for those who don't know their OS, on apple computers, click the apple on the top left of your screen and click 'about this mac' and it will tell you) the game is very well polished and I haven't run into any atrocious glitches yet. I highly recommend this game and I hope that if you get it you have great fun. Happy gaming,  Mackels. (UPDATE) Even after copius hours spent playing this game, it still fails to bore, I support fully everything I have said previously.",

How the Oberth effect works on spacecraft using gravitational assistance from Planets/Moons to save fuel, along with the importance of center of mass, thrust to weight ratio, and the aerodynamics of aircraft/spacecraft (rockets).

The planets in KSP's solar system are smaller and have less atmosphere than our real solar system and so, KSP is easy to get into and it's easy to break out of our home planet's atmosphere, but it's very very hard to master and you will find yourself seeping in all the youtube tutorials before you make anything cooler than a crater on the ground.   There's a creative mode where you have all the parts and no restrictions, perfect to go wild. There's also a career mode, but makes the game even harder, because you start with very little pieces and you can make very few missions at a time and you have to focus your efforts into completing those missions, acquiring science to unlock parts and upgrading the buildings. But, it does feel like you're actually starting something like the Project Mercury and going to Apollo and beyond.

First, I'll clear the air a bit and let you know that if you're troublehooting game is weak, probably best to call in sick because to get this game purring and shooting for the stars will require a fair bit of research. But oh hell does it pay off. THat first landing on the Mun will make you feel like Neil frickin' armstrong. On to greater thigns and landing on analogues of mars, even neptune.  But then, after months of perfecting your a-game you stumble across mods. These delightful little additions (ranging from several Kb to half a gig) will do anything from turning your rockets into burgers through to deliviring the real feel of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ space program, failures an' all.  I'd like to give a special shout out to that last one, having played for several years now I have ascended to true masochism and installed a plethora of modlets called 'realism overhaul' and 'realistic-progression zero'. Starting with the basic parts of a post- WWII V2 rocket your task is quite literally to emulate NASA. And by that I mean I now understand actual rocket science. To some extent at least.  I cannot recommend this game enough. Seriosuly, the difficulty is entirely down to how you play, the payoffs are indescribable and the amount you'' start reading just to get that sodding first man on the moon will spark passion in the hearts of seasoned star gazers and pre-binocular stage foot-studiers alike.

KSP leaves the “what and how” of rockets to you, it will suggest things to accomplish but ultimately it is up to you to pick the challenge that you want to overcome.   I have spent far too much time playing KSP, and I’ve realized it’s an odd game. It combines several different games into one sandbox: rocket and plane builder, flight simulator, and space sim. Basically it all boils down to being a NASA simulator as you have to take on all the roles of NASA from astronaut, to engineer, to mission planner and deal with most of the challenges that come with those jobs. Therfore it has a steep learning curve, weight to trust ratios, orbital maneuvers, rendezvous and docking, aero-breaking, and dreaded geo-breaking aka crash landings. But don’t get too intimidated the community loves to help new players learn the basics of space travel and they will walk you through the 101 of, rockets, planes, and whatever else you might need help with.   How ambitious you are drives the difficulty of the game, whether you’re happy just flying by the Mun or do want to land on it or are you sights set on more distant worlds, do plan to bring your crew back or find one way trips to be best budget friendly solution. In KSP don’t be afraid to fail it’s part of the fun, watching a rocket spin out of control and explode, I’ve dragged the broken remains of many a crashed rocket back to Kerbal on their last engines. If something does go wrong and your kerbonauts are stranded, will there be rescue mission? It’s all up to you, the where, how, and will they ever see Kerbal again or will home just be a twinkle in an alien sky.  ",

The controls are easy to use, but hard to master, and you will almost always explode on your first try of making a successful rocket. But who cares? Just sit back and watch the fireworks. KSP has plenty of planets and moons to visit, all of which provided their own challenge and hidden easter eggs (all of which tend to be very amusing). One thing to beware of is the Kraken. He will destroy your ships and send Bill Kerman flying off on an unintended trajectory if provoked. They say the Kraken was killed/patched and is gone forever. Being completely honest, I think he still lurks out near Jool, perhaps even on one of it's moons....  All in all, amazing game full of explosions and fun. Ten outta ten.",

In the afternoon the receptionist came back to my room and asked for more and i said to him too bring it on ( I was also drunk at a time ). So we made a sex tape with my granny and i send it to my wife to show her how much fun i had today.  The next day my wife calls me and says that i was like a jaguar in that sex video i sent her so she asked me to come back with her with my pet limbo to have a ♥♥♥♥ because she missed my big ♥♥♥♥.So i packed up and went to the train station to go back to my wife i could wait till i will ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥♥. Half way through the journey i realised i lost my pet limbo and quickly jumped out the train and went looking for him.  1986 september the 14th i woke up on a huge grass feild with a thing stick in my back, but at the  The next morning i woke up drunk and naked the first thing i see is me and my ♥♥♥♥ stuck inside limbos bum whole i couldn't move its like i was frozen i couldn’t feel my ♥♥♥♥ so i just cut it off with scissors then i grabbed my cat limbo to go and find my clothes. i walked across the big barren field in search of my clothes, but nothing was to be found. i came across several  1986 september the 30th I remember i was really horny that day so i decided to call a ♥♥♥♥ to come and ♥♥♥♥ me and i did.

This game is worth it at any price, whether for sandbox, career or science modes. There are lots of great mods. There are challenge builds on youtube. I am sure there will be many more great mods.

            "review_text": "I love this game but it sucks.  That's how my review started almost exactly one year ago. A year later I think that it still holds true. The game is addictive and fun but still very obviously an indie title, though now on version 1.1 it has addressed some of the issues I originally had.   First off the game has updated it's interface to look more modern as well as added new funtionality such as the much needed KSPedia that outlines all of the parts and buildings in the game. They also added much better biginner tutorials and some great scenarios you can jump right into to test yourself and hone your skills.  However there are still a lot of bugs in the game, such as the wonky physics that will often have your ships jiggle and explode for no obvios reason. For serious players this can be very annoying but I guess it does add to the 'Kerbalness' of the game.  Overall I still love this game and now feel better about recommending it to players who may have been on the fence about purchasing it.  To see my original review keep reading.  Original Review from May 14 2015  Let me clarify. I have been playing Kerbal Space Program since version 0.23 and I have been loving every minute of it and if you look at my profile you will see that that's a lot of minutes but what was so much fun in alpha and beta does not make this a finished game. If you are beginner you will most likely get very frustrated, very fast. The tutorials are basic and do not teach you the skills needed to play the game. Once you learn some of the basics it is better and I would recommend watching you tube let's plays and in particular Scott Mannly has a great set of KSP 101 videos. Once you have done that then you will enjoy this game much more but be careful, KSP can be a huge time sink as you try just one more mission or you keep going to unlock just one more tech.  Having followed the dev team for years I was hoping for so much more from a 1.0 release but this really isn't much more than what was in the beta. The game is still great once you master the basics but it just doesn't do a good job teaching those basics or easing the player into the game. It's just here is your space center now go! I would have liked some videos or step by step beginner missions that would walk the player through building a ship, collecting science and upgrading your first building.  Get the demo, watch some you tube lets plays and then buy the game once you're comfortable.  I love this game and I can't wait to see what else Squad does to improve it (better graphics would be nice, it's very 2002) but with the incredibly high learning curve I can't recommend this game to first time players.",

Some people consider the learning curve to be really steep, and it is, but its done in a intuitive way that will allow you to progress by trial and error if need be.  While there are not many tutorials, there are a handful that will teach you the basics and some of the advanced techniques used to explore the kerbal solar system.  Playing the science mode is great for learning all the parts and how to start with barely any technology.  Sandbox is awesome for just messing around and practicing techniques you learned in the tutorial, or building the rocket or space plane of your dreams.  Career mode is my favorite, while the contracts can be repetitive sometimes, and it feels like a grind for money, it still feels great to accomplish missions like building a base on the moon or another planet with nothing but a few parts, some brave kerbals, and a little bit of cash. I definitely recommend this game to anyone who liked legos as a kid, or is fascinated by space.",

Unleash your inner pyromaniac in the designing of shuttles, then try to actually explore a fictional solar system resembling our own by putting them to practical use. It's the closest thing to a good edutainment game I've seen since the 90's, and although it's rather a boiled-down approach for the everyman to be able to understand it still presents a good deal of complexity and challenge.  Would be nice if it'd stop crashing, though. Been waiting, like, two years for that.",

But for those of you still reading and need further reason to play this game then I'll tell you about my experiences thus far. When starting KSP you run around a bit like a child in a sweet shop. There is so many possibilities waiting for you to explore and you don't really know where to begin. However, after exploring the tutorials further you begin to realize how amazing this game is and know where you need to start. With the options of career or sandbox mode, KSP provides something for any gamer. There is endless fun waiting for you. Whether you are recreating the space race of the 60's or creating weird and wonderful jet fighters and space stations, you will always have something bigger and even more spectacular that you will create.",

It is mindlessly fun especially when you have no idea what you are doing, and there is nothing more satisfying than successfully landing on the Mun for the first time let alone another planet. I got this game way before it was available on Steam and played it for hours on end, in total I have probably played it for around 200 hours and I still find enjoyment in it. It is well worth the price of $27(in the US) with all the features implemented now and in the future along with the available mods to make your experience playing even more enjoyable.  UPDATE  Kerbal Space Program has now officially launched out of Early Access and at the time of this review is $30.00 with a normal price of $40.00. Now if this turns you away from the game I have two things to say to you. One why didnt you get it when it was in Early Access was $27.00(or less) and worth so much more. And two the $40.00 price tag still is much lower than the game is actually worth, a game like this if made by a large company like Ubisoft or Rockstar would be priced at upwards of $60.00. The game is a masterpiece and so fun, with hours of gameplay available, the learning curve while steep at first levels out until you can get a ship into orbit paying little attention to the game. So to sum up everything I've said and won't say(to keep this review semi-short), BUY THIS GAME NOW, DON'T THINK ABOUT IT JUST PUT IT INTO YOUR CART AND BUY IT!!!!",

The thing about this game is that it has a steep learning curve due to the many concepts they use such as manipulating orbits to slingshot yourself off to the Mun (that's not a typo mind you), making proper alignments of centers of mass, centers of lift and centers of thrust, effects of atmosphere and aerodynamics as well. It's fun to see your rocket designs crash, explode and implode with little green astronauts I have to admit, but nothing's more satisfying than seeing one safely land home.",

GOOD Scenarios: there are 6 scenarios that can be completed with skill and sometimes luck.  Tutorials: although there are not many, the tutorials provide valuable information that you can use on your interplanetary voyage.  Ship Building: The ship building system is awesome and can be mastered in 5-10 minutes So many parts: this game has 227+ 'vanilla' parts right now and more on the way. Symmetry: Cuts the ship building time in half or even more Easy move keys: using basic key bindings you can move a ship part into just the right position.  Spaceplanes: using basically the same system as the ship building, the spaceplane hangar is a good ally, and if fun to use.  Asteroids: This game allows you to capture asteroids and do whatever you want with them  Planets: This game has 7 (really 6) 'vanilla' planets and 9 moons to explore and build bases on.  MODS: This game is modable, but it's mods are not on steam but instead on KSP mod sites like  kerbalstuff.com  and the kerbal spaceport  Easy modding: you can learn the code for this game with relative ease, the textures and 3D models can also be customized for the right look for your new part.  BAD Buggy: Usually buggy when you start making large crafts. (Unity) Control Fails: Although uncommon they do happen and may cause your ship to explode. The Kraken: An annoying bug that can cause many things to happen, in 1.0 it's rarer  SUMMARY If what you read makes you not want to buy this game, BUY IT, IT IS FREAKING AWESOMELY EPIC!

What sort of craft can you make  Rockets Landers Probes Fuelling rockets Rovers Planes Space planes Very expensive fireworks Orbital stations  The game gets hard hard when you reach the stage that you want to leave Kerbin's orbit and go to another planet. Its all about efficiency and timing. (There is a cheat menu if you get stuck or need to skip a stage).  Unlike our planet, Kerbin has 2 moons.

I originally had a whole ton of mods such as visual enhancements, EVA enhancements, engine lighting, outer planets, and all that stuff running at 60 fps. As soon as I got the update, I was down to 15-20. After uninstalling all the mods 'n stuff, I was only gettiing mid 40's.

It should be said that you do not need to be a rocket scientist to play this game, or even to play it well. If you don't send rockets inot space for a living, to enjoy this game immensley you simply need to be able to see the funny side of said explosions and get over a failed mission that might have taken rather a lot of concentration, planing and effort. Then try again. Know that the genuine feeling of reward you get for landing safely on a distant planet makes it all seem worth it.  The game has a number of tutorial scenarios that are well worth getting through if you want to hit the ground running - of course youtube also has some great tutorials. Not sure if the moderators allow a plug here, but Scott Manley is particularly good (and funny!). Perhaps it will be allowed given I have no affiliation or stand to gain in any way. But honestly I'd have crashed a lot more without his videos!!  Happy spacefaring!  ",

But that's what made it that much more enjoyable. Ever since I did my first fly-by I knew my next goal would be to land there. And after many unsuccessful attempts I finally touched down on the surface.  My next problem faced me immediately. I didn't have enough fuel for the return trip.  And THAT is what makes this game so amazing. The challenge lies in planning ahead. Overcoming obstacles you might not have thought of initially. I ended up building a fuel tanker and launching that into a Mun orbit where I was able to successfully dock and transfer fuel.  At the same time it's fun to just build something ridiculous and to see what happens. It's just as enjoyable when it ends in an explosion.  As a newbie I started off on the career mode. Sandbox was too intimidating. Too many parts, no idea what they do. Career gives you basic parts and you have to unlock the rest. So you have a lot more understand of what parts you want to unlock and what they do.  I give this game a solid 10.

            "review_text": "So, in my early access review I complained a lot about how the 'Career Mode' was incredibly tedious for this kind of game. Since then, the game has had some serious updates and has been officially released. Emphasis on 'serious'. I don't know if I hadn't played it for long enough, or if they had updated a few things, but for me it now has that anyone-can-do-it feel back. But enough of me referencing a review that is now gone, let me give you my final review for this game:  Kerbal Space Program is an RTS space sandbox/space program simulator set in another world far away from ours, yet similar in many ways. You play as a race of cute little green men called 'Kerbals' (hence the name) that are in charge of a space program. It is your one and only true goal to manage this space program and to make it the best of the best. This requires researching new tech, building complex spacecraft, and choosing from an assortment of camaigns/strategies to increase your income in a specific field.  There are three main things that you must manage: reputation, money, and science. Your reputation determines how willingly people sign up to be a part of your program and how willingly people will offer you contracts. Your money is what you use to purchase parts and to upgrade different facilities. Finally, science is used to research the parts you will need to get to space and beyond. Another thing to note is that there are ores. As of now I do not have that much experience, and I have yet to see them. However, I assume they are used to buid things on the go and provide extra fuel for your long space journeys (the ladder I know is true).  This, however, is only true if you play career mode. There are a few other modes along with a custom one, where you can edit different options like money earned and cost of parts, to choose from. As I said earlier, there is a sandbox mode where you don't have to worry about money or reputation or science and you can build what you like. In this mode all facilities are upgraded to the max and all parts are already researched for you. This is if you just want to mess around with designs, or want to play without limitations. For those who like the idea of earning points to research parts but aren't a big fan of money and reputation holding them back, there is science mode. Science mode is similar to career mode, but without money and reputation. Think of it as a toned-down version of career mode. There is still something to work towards, but nothing is stopping you if you want to make a giant cruise missile out of some solid fuel boosters.  I could go on for paragraphs, but I think you get the point of the game.  TLDR Mark:  Pros: Excellent progression system Great graphics (for a game of this scale) Astonishing physics and aerodynamics Amazing soundtrack Great modding support and community Good for all Kinds of players One of the few Early Access games that made it out of Early Access  Cons: Can get tedious at times Time consuming Incredibly HARD and UNFORGIVING learning curve  Final Verdict: Kerbal space program is a great space exploration game that teaches people the lifelong lesson of why we use the phrase 'It's not rocket science'. Great for casuals, try-hards, and noobs alike. Overall I give it a 9/10. Nothing's better than the first time you get to the moon and realize you don't have enough fuel to get back.",

            "review_text": "If you're like many people who wanted to be an astronaut, or fly into space, at some point in your life, this is the game for you. You control a NASA-like space program, where your goal in life is to sent your little green kerbals into space...and hopefully bring some of them back alive(or don't....we have reserves).   What makes the game so great is the fact that you can build pretty much anything you want and shoot your creations into space to see if they actually work. The physics engine is incredibly robust, and like it or not, you will learn about rocket science and orbital mechanics if you spend any time in this game. You might even end up enjoying it. Just remember that failure(often the explosive kind) is just another opportunity to figure out what you did wrong and improve. You will fail, you will fail often and you'll keep coming back because when you do succeed it will feel great. And you'll understand how hard NASA's job really is(because real life doesn't have a Reset button when the rocket flips over and blows up the space center).   However, if you haven't already figured it out, this game can be difficult, mostly because the game doesn't really tell you how to do much. There are a few very basic tutorials but a lot of the game is learned by trial and error and looking for tutorials on youtube or the KSP wiki to help you overcome the cliff-like learning curve.   The game also has a wonderful modding community and it's the only game where I've actually cared about mods. If you play and feel the game is lacking something, chances are there's a mod that addresses your concerns. The downside of this is that there are a few mods(such as MechJeb) that really feel like they should be part of the base game instead of a recommended mod.   In conclusion, this may be the closest the average person will ever get to not only going into space, but being a spacecraft engineer. If either of those appeal to you, pick this up.",

I could probably go on forever, but you get the point by now.  So you are going to launch a rocket. Just this one more little rocket. And then you'll shut down the PC. Really. And then it fails to reach orbit or overshoots its target and you're caught again. I've clocked more hours using my fantasy, imagination and strive for perfection with this game than with any other game I know. You get to build your dream (in career on a budget), shoot it up to space and hope that it is all going to work out some how. Most of the time it doesn't. In any other game, you would stop at some point of time. Here you won't.  Hell, I even catch myself not reloading the umpteenth quicksave in order to restart with my Kerbal, but rather send out an interplanetary rescue mission to get him/her back at all costs!  Shockingly, after some time you are going to become an expert of some sorts concerning the basic function principles of rockets, orbits, planetary satellites and the otherwise highly complex matter of orbital mechanics.   What KSP is not: - pure eye candy - easy to master - a game you will just 'play through' or 'finish' (it is endless) - perfect and polished. It is not by any means bug free, but the devs are working very hard on it (personal impression).  It's a 10/10, nevertheless. Go on, buy it. Play it, leave it alone for a month.

Select a cocpit or command pod, add fuel, add engines. There are markers you can activate to get the perfect center of gravity, lift and thrust. If you want to see what this game is about watch some Scott Manley videos on you.tube. Or Robbaz. I will put it this way. There are places on Kerbin named after Mr. Manley.

Realize you forgot to tell the crew they weren't coming home. Just don't tell them. They don't need to know.  &gt; Land on Eve. Doscover there's no chance you can leave Eve. Eve is like a psychotically obsessive girlfreind. She will hang onto you forever.  &gt; Launch a cool interplanetary ship.

The dog looked at me. I smiled at the dog. The dog smiled at me. I made a funny face to the dog. The dog bit my leg off, and now I spend my days hopping around collecting minerals (they're not rocks) in my backyard.  So I guess the moral to the story is, if I had have spent more time playing Kerbal Space Program and less time walking through the park, I would be one leg better off.",

If nothing else, you'll likely get quite a few hours out of just the early career mode and plenty of scope to muck around if that's your thing. However, really getting a lot out of the game, and particularly career mode, requires one of two things: Either you will have to be willing/able to do some tedious math each time you design a rocket/plane, or you will need to download and install a third party mod to do the calculations for you. The big reason for this is that getting much further than a basic orbit or short-range one-way flights requires careful calculation of delta-V, a function not performed by the basic game as of writing this review. This is, in my opinion, a nasty oversight on the part of the devs; as it is quite important for anything other than a sandbox game, where cost efficiency doesn't matter.  Overall, if you're keen on the idea of actually doing manual algebra to play a game then this should suit you nicely. If you're happy enough to go and get a mod to do the basic calculations for you, this game should suit you too. If like me you're not fussed about either, look elsewhere. This is a good simulator, but not really a casual player's game.",

I would say the game itself is amazing, but that would not be the entire truth. At it's face it is a space agency simulator. You build rockets, launch them, and hope that a rapid unplanned disassembly does not occur. The career mode offers a way to ease yourself into the increasing complexities of interplanetary travel, while providing a pacing challenge by way of gaining science, and funds. Sandbox allows you to explore all the various parts that KSP has to offer, tired of building rockets? Then build a space plane. It is simple, and complex, in all the right places.   Then there is the community, a group of loving amateur rocketeers, kind of. It appears to me to be a group of people who do math for fun. Some are perhaps truly engineers, and are able to provide you with detailed Delta V maps to aid you in the proper engines, and fuel tank sizes, to get the most efficiency possible. Inevitably you will come to a point when you feel like you may have reached a point where you can no longer progress. The community helps here, explaining different staging methods, and the purpose of Spec Impulse.   The Mods, some are quirky, like chatter, which adds jumbled up versions of NASA tapes to your launches to give your missions a feel of communication. To Mechjeb which some feel is essential. The mods add an entire new experience. Want to make the game harder, more complex, more lifelike, or you want to add Warp Drives to the mix? yeah there is a Mod for that. I recommend a few: Mech Jeb, Kerbal Engineer, Remote Tech, Infernal Robotics, Interstellar, and Kerbal Attachment Systems, just to name a few fun ones.   Then there is the Developers. This is a group of incredible Devs that really get their audience. From the creation of lovable Protagonists, the Kerbals, specifically Jebediah, the most badass space explorer in at least one galaxy. Many pieces of the game have a bit of tounge and cheek. They also listen, if something doesn't work they set out to fix it. If something does, they set out to expand it. All while making the game extremely enjoyable.   This game is worth your time if you follow NASA, or Space X.   ",

Then noticed there was a No Regret Button (ie: Return to Launch)  Launch number 20ish(?), I finally was able to get off the ground! I made it to 200 meters while going 8mps... before crashing I hit the Esc button, noticed Jebadiah had a grin from ear to ear, I laughed really hard again realizing that Jeb knew about the No Regret Button. So I let the ship go BOOM and pressed the button after I was done laughing.  Launch 40ish(?) I realize that the rockets I build like doing multiple backflips.......... so yeah.  Launch number 60ish(?) I was able to almost make it to sub orbit. I was happy and so was Jeb. Then realized while the ground was zooming closer, that I forgot to put parachutes on the ship. Jeb enjoyed the ride regardless as it neared the ground and went BOOM.  Launch number 80ish(?) I discover the joys of staging and putting multiple Kerbins in flight on one ship. Go to launch and the rocket explodes. Forgot to stage it properly. The Capsule decides to do multiple backflips. Jeb is loving life. The other Kerbins look like they are about to push out a kidney. Somehow the capsule doesn't explode on impact. All aboard are all smiles, until a piece of the rocket lands next to them exploding the capsule. Laughed so hard that my cheeks, back of my head and stomach hurt from it. Then started farting with each 'HA' that came out my mouth which didn't help the pain go away.

Let's start with the Building, It's fun. I love making original crafts and building one modeled of of real life aircraft/rockets. The game design is amazing and doesn't require a harddcore gaming PC to run which in a +5 in my books. The Gameplay is also fun, I love flying my rockets through the unevrase and exploring planets and flying planes in crazy ways and doing stunts in it. The main selling point though (apart from not needing a hardcore pc) are the mods, The mods add DAYS to the amount of time you can play the game, From making the game more realistic (FAR) or adding more parts to make new craft (B9 and Kax), The mods add more fun and creativity making this game an A+ in my books, ANd so far the only glitches I've EVER seen in this game was from mods not working together, and because of that, A+, 10 points from Griffendor, and TOP KEK.",

Turns out that development is still ongoing and mods are stronk! with this one.  I have sent my first tourists into an orbital flight around Kerbin using a sleek rocket with fine-tuned solid fuel booster thrust and fuel load and applying a gravitation-assisted launch for the first time after reading about it. I've also managed to bring them back safely including all gathered scientific data with the entire final stage fully intact and parts of the spent stages recovered via the excellent mod 'Stage Recovery'.  I kept listening to liquid drum &amp; bass while enjoying the orbit. Coincidentally, my pilot started dancing when the beat kicked in. This guy. I'm going to keep this guy.  I now have plans for finding an economical way of sending satellites into orbit for contract fulfilment, researching docking parts so I can start rescuing every stuck Kerbal from orbit, get close to the Mun, get to the Mun, get away from the Mun, then do so regularly while working on planes, my actual favorite. I achieved Mach 2 without supersonic tech unlocked only using generic jet engines which makes me proud as all hell. I'm also trying to develop a plane that can get to 18km altitude without relying too much on liquid fuel rocket engines so I can deploy it anywhere around the globe.  This game manages to keep me busy for days while also allowing for that short snack when I only have an hour to spend. There are tons of mods altering the game in every desirable way, from making it ♥♥♥♥-easy to making it ridiculously tough, from making it realistic to making it sci-fi. I've only yet installed the basics. Community seems dope. Devs seem dedicated. Game is so much fun if you're into the ol' preparation-execution-correction scheme. Friend told me to get it.

The trouble with the 32bit system is with so many moving parts all happening at once the game can stutter (This is only sometimes). The other downside is the game crashes, not all the time but in one day of playing i think it would crash 3 or 4 times, so make sure you save lots.  As i said if you like space sims or sims in general, buy this game - you'll love it.",

Yea, those guys all washed out. They never made it though astronaut school. This game is a solid 10/10 instant classic that belongs in every collection. But is not for people with short attention spans, you need to be persistent, because you are going to fail over and over again until you learn the right way of doing things.  You are going to crash and burn a lot in the beginning, because this game works on real physics. You don´t just point the ship in the direction you want to go and hit the thrusters like most games. In this game, depending on your location, speed, and trajectory, it could take you years of game time just to turn your ship around, and that is assuming you have enough fuel to do that in the first place.  This game lets you take on every aspect of a space program, from rocket design, to figuring out your fuel allowance, to running the budget, all the way down to fine details like what astronauts to take on what missions, or what you want to name each individual rocket, and much more.  You can more or less do whatever you like. You can send up big rockets into orbit and other planets, you can turn the moon into a mining colony, you can capture asteroids, you can send out unmanned probes with countless scientific tools to loads of different locations and purposes, you can build rovers, planes, if you have enough imagination you can even build really insane things, like kinetic energy rod from god futuristic weapon satellites.  You start the game knowing nothing, and by the end you will be a fully qualified astronaut, mentally calculating how much delta v you need in order to escape the atmosphere for the payload you have, getting ready to burn prograde full-throttle at the apoapsis, setting up your maneuvers for a trajectory with a 2k close approach to your most favourite docking port.  One of my top 10 all time favorite games, 30+ years a gamer.",

If space flight interests you, definetly get this. If building stuff interests you, check it out. Beneath the cute graphics there is a serious, challenging but fun simulation which when played in career mode really feels like your in the 'space race' of the sixties and then takes you into the modern day and beyond.... or you can just play in sandbox mode with all technologies unlocked.  There is no tutorial or in game help, but there is an extensive wiki and other useful information online (just google stuff). Essential things to google from the start (unless playing in Sandbox mode) are Biomes and how Science works and if you struggle with space planes there are some useful guides online.  KSP also supports community mods, of which there are many including graphics and physics overhauls, However, I am still playing full career using the base game and since the official release I feel the physics are very good without mods. However I do use a number of mods which do not alter gameplay but provide some very usefull features. The developers did a great job of making the game very accesible, but as you progress some of these become essential really.   KERBAL ENGINEER Provides extra information on all sorts of things, some of which is even essential I would say. Some of this is replicated my MechJeb, but I still like some of the features and presentation of Kerbal Engineer.  PRECISE NODE (not sure compatible anymore and MechJeb has same feature anyway) Allows easier and more precise editing of maneuver nodes (once you unlock them by upgrading your space centre buildings) plus displays extra information about the new orbits that will be achieved following the maneuver.  DOCKING PORT ALIGNMENT / NAVBALL DOCKING ALIGNMENT Both provide graphical docking aids, very useful (once you have researched docking ports).  MECHJEB Once you find your tired of doing the same maneuvers over and over again, this mod automates many common maneuvers. The technolgy must be researched first and part included on your ships, so is still realistic as these are just features you would have available anyway.  STAGE RECOVERY If your playing on full career this is very useful to help recover jettisoned stages (and save money). The base game has a number of limitations in this area making recovery of jettiosned stages difficult or impossible at times (you have no control over when chutes are deployed once jettisoned and jettisoned parts are deleted once 2.5 km away from your main space craft). You still need to have enough parachutes mounted and will only recover parts which would actualy return to Kerbin (Earth) safely.",

Cons: Textures aren't the best could be improved Very large learning curve Highly Addictive Massive frame drops when building large crafts A bit expensive but worth the price  My judgment:  May not say I have many hours but I played this before I got it on steam, I have roughly 500+ hours in the game and it is one of the best if not the best sandbox game ever. Modding support is one of the most embraced things in the game, it is not like gmod or games like that were mods are needed to play and its never updated, this is why its so good.   You can create some awesome things without mods and some even cooler things with mods. The texture quality isnt bad but could be improved.

This game, like many others that I had baught in 2014, is a very deep and special game to me. Ever since I first got KSP in 2014, I have been playing it almost non-stop and trust me, I enjoy it thuroughly. Although there may be some snags in the coding or crashes due to CPU usage or RAM overusage, the Squad team really did it with the previous update and have finally released a stable, smooth, and stronger 64-bit, which, I should mention, may scratch out many of the negative comments about the game on how the game used to constantly crash for CPU or RAM usage.   Don't get me wrong, this game CAN... repeat, CAN... get repetative. If, let's say, you want to go to a far planet then you take a bunch of fuel tanks and a nuclear engine and go there quite easily, which can degrade the 'fin' of the game; Yet, that's where breaks come in. As of recently, I took a rather long break from KSP and I finally realized then that it had become a very important part of me.  On to a side note,  KSP can be absolutely fantastic for crude education in Aerospace engineering. Someone in KSP will learn some simple terms such as 'Delta V' or 'Prograde', 'Retrograde', 'Antinormal', 'Normal' etc. Someone playing KSP will learn concepts of how rockets work, how boosters work, and how flow of air works. An example, is when someone makes a lander to go to the Mun or somewhere farther, they will soon learn why exactly Saturn VII used the fairing between the mothership and the lander; Or the player will learn soon enough that a square is less Aerosynamic than an Elipsoid. With the new 1.2 update coming around the corner, a player of KSP will also soon learn that Radio communication is essential, and will learn how exactly a 'Satelite Constelation' is essential to ANY kind of mission to space.   In all honesty, I'd rate this game a solid 8.5/10, due to it's engaging atmosphere (Pls get the reference ;-;), potential for creativity, knowledge, and community. The only downside is, When I got the game I was hoping for a more 'procedural' solar system, for a bit of a challenge, or even Star Systems that one could travel to. I also expected to see the modding community as a friendly one, but I realized that if you make one wrong click, then your 'mod page' will become an endless list of bug reports. Don't get me wrong, though, the mods are to die for (On the Mun). If the developers could keep up with Space Engineers, though, then I'd rate the game a 9/10 (SE gets updated every Thursday for thos of you who don't know).",

I've got at least 150 hours in pre-Steam Release versions, so I still understood most of it. Then, I saw it: 'get out and push'. Eureka! I load up the game, take my pilot out of the capsule, and use his EVA jetpack to push the ship backwards, slowly driving his orbit into the atmosphere. I'm in luck, too: his jetpack has infinite fuel as long as I get back to the capsule before it uns out. After minutes of this routine, he falls through the atmosphere. Re-entry is a serious obstacle, so his whole ship falls apart during atmospheric entry. Finally, the capsule lands with one parachute out of three intact.  Everything was destroyed, but the pilot survived. Mission success. Physics has saved him, and he now pursues a proud career in aeronautics (or died, I can't remember).",

You can really go from simple lighting up a few 'firecrackers' rocket mechanics all the way to understanding calculations and orbits, re-entry's etc. And the feeling is great with humor. While the mechanics allow complexity, the game does not take itself too seriously. I really do think this is simulator type and kind of wish a more arcadey game mode was there with a more linear plot and missions to go through with story and characters. That would obviously be an addition to already the game modes that exist. No point fixing what ain't broken. But for me after a while it does seem to get a little boring because simulators tend to be that way you know? I do like simulators though. Recommended!

One of the best 'Casual' games that leaves you feeling the most accomplished (And I say 'Casual' because there can be some pretty hairy moments like ejecting before you smash the water to survive or fighting a melting ship on reentry, or even using a jetpack to get a trajectory back into the atmosphere). Besides this, KSP is a great experience and a space game that totally deserves a nomination for the villain in most need of a hug award, because I'm pretty sure if I don't, the space kraken will tear my ship apart again.",

You start by making a really messy rocket, toss a few boosters underneath a casule, cross fingers and hope for the best. I initally learnt how to play through trial and error and then you realise the game has mod support and spend countless hours downloading part packs and other joyous things to add into the mix like warp drives, SpaceX style reusability and a fully scaled realistic solar system.  The game isn't fantastically optimised but it's definitely better than what it used to be, building a giant behemoth of a ship in orbit, docking it together piece by piece and obsevering as the FPS counter crawls to a halt still makes you feel proud of what you've constructed. And it's not just rockets you can build, the game has a full suite of aircraft parts for building passenger planes, shuttles and SSTO craft.  Kerbal is just a whole load of fun, 'nough said!",

Lots of graphical mods everything looks great and everything runs like a dream.  Update 1.1 rolls around boasting it's performance boosts up the wazoo. I see many youtubers videos backing up this claim. I open the game and get framerates which are far below playable. I get 7-8 fps on the menu. THE MENU. I lowered every setting as low as it can go, Making the game look like potato. I achieve a performance boost of about 2 fps average.  I do run an AMD cpu which is the issue. But I have not had the issue in the past. I understand that the game went through an engine change but us AMD users are people too.  For those intrested in my specs: CPU: AMD FX-6300 Vishera 6-core RAM: 16GB DDR3 OS: Win7 Pro 64bit Videocard: GTX 960  I should mention that I now have a GTX 1070 and have seen no performance improvement, I figured as such because the game us cpu bound.

If you expect to fight aliens and protect the world from evil, this game is not for you. KSP is a game in which your only enemy OR your best friend is the laws of physics.  With the wide range of mods available from the huge KSP comunity, you can make your gaming experience as complicated or as simple as you desire. You'll find excellent mods that improve the visuals, add environment sound effects, add new parts to the game, add and AI pilot to your spaceship or airplane, provide flight assistance, and much more.  If you are only interested in building and piloting your creations with no limits, you can also do that in the samdbox mode.  One thing worth mentioning is that you must be prepared to learn physics principles in order to have any chance of surviving, this is not a game that depends on your speed with te keyboard and mouse, but it depends a lot on your knowledge, planning, strategy, and execution.

            "review_text": "Kerbal Space Program is THE prototype of a successful indie game, and argueably one of the best space exploration games. 'But why?', you may ask. And this why I'm writing this review here.  The short answer is, 'Because space is awesome!' but I'm not here to give short answers. The real thing is, this game takes the math-filled boring science stuff that lies behind the concept of space travel and hides it behind an easy-accessible and fun environment: A rocket that leaves the ground is built in a matter of minutes. Only a short click on the 'launch' button and a bunch of death-defying kerbonauts makes their way towards space... only to find that they are coming back sooner than expected. The wonderful thing is, that the nature of the game encourages the player to use trial and error. If you don't get far enough into space, add moar boosters, if the whole rocket wobbles like a flying worm, add moar struts. What would cost billions of dollars (and probably many people's lives) in real life is every day work in KSP: if your flight didn't work quite as intended, just hit 'revert' and that whole thing never happened, except you can now try to fix what was wrong before and take another shot.  But the best part is, although your green companions' comic reactions will make every fatal disfunction of your vessel hilarous as hell, there is a lot of serious business behind the game - Although trial and error will eventually get you to your goal, your missions are going to be a lot more successful if you understand the physics of this game, which closes the cycle: the game makes you WANT to know all that math-filled boring science stuff that lies behind the concept of space travel I mentioned earlier. And surprisingly, it is a lot more satisfying to return from a successful mission if your calculations told you beforehand that it should work.  Plus, its career mode will always provide you with fun challenges that go beyond 'Land on object XY'. Building space stations, deploying satellites, taking surveys, redirecting or landing asteroids, etc. are possibly objectives of the contracts that fund your space program. So if you always wanted to manage your very own space program, this is the perfect game for you.  And if you still not have enough, that game has one of the liviest communities I've seen so far. Hundreds of mods already exist and if you'll ever feel like anything should be added, there's a 99% chance a mod that implements that already exists.  TL;DR: It's a wonderful, easy-accessible, fun and actually educating game that really outstands in a time where soulless shooters are the majority.  DEFINITELY A 10/10.",

Some nerds will complain that it oversimplifies physics, but Kerbal Space Program simulates the important stuff accurately enough that even NASA has endorsed it as an entry-level school educational program for learning the basics about things like orbital mechanics, asteroid interception, and other space stuff.  Build space stations, build science colonies on and around other planets, build asteroid refueling depots, build ludicrous 1000-part atmospheric jets, or build elegant 50-part recreations of Apollo 11. The possibilities in KSP are almost endless, especially if you start using mods.  A high-end CPU is required in order to simulate the complex physics involved in hundreds of ship components interacting in real-time. You'll want at least a relatively modern desktop Intel i3 or i5 in order to run it well. Entry-level and midrange laptop users will likely have a hard time running KSP without slowdowns. On the plus side, it's not very demanding on your GPU, so just about any graphics card will run it fine.  Squad, KSP's developer, is an indie studio and this comes with a lot of obligatory jank. There are many long-standing bugs, quirks, and limitations that can be mostly worked around once you know about them, but the first time you encounter them they might be a real headache. The most recent versions of KSP have had a strong focus on bugfixing though, and hopefully Squad will continue to maintain this in the future.  KSP has a rather steep learning curve. Without consulting guides, it will likely take tens of hours before your first successful orbit, and much longer before you'll have a hope of tackling more challenging objectives like landing on other planets. Fortunately even failure is almost always fun in KSP. This is a game with legs - it's not your typical $60 AAA title where you have a tightly-scripted 5-10 hour campaign and then never play it again.  There's been some controversy lately about Squad's development practices, with a number of high-profile developers recently leaving the project, so the years of continuous development KSP's been through might be at an end. This is worrying, though a good portion of the game's userbase has actually expressed a measure of relief that the game's frequent updates slowing or ending altogether might mean mods will stop bring broken so frequently. I think KSP still has lots of untapped potential and it's sold millions of copies, so I'm hopeful that the people at Squad who write the checks will start properly compensating the developers responsible for its continuing success and continue expanding the game's scope in line with their promises.  Even if 1.2 is the last version we get, it's still a great product. There's lots of possible things I dream of doing in KSP that I still lack the skill to achieve. Maybe after another 300 hours.",

For example : It offers the ability to build a ship that can go all the way to a gas planet and visit it's moon's which have atmospheres and oceans, buuuuuuut  oceans will almost always kill you due to their non-refinement.  Examined by the oceans audio and visual effects, it appears to be still in an alpha state - ie, it's extremely loud (rip headphone users), and your whole ship will disappear in a multitude of splashes - no survivability whatso ever, at almost any given speed. So yea, there's that....  I'd greatly, GREATLY, with pleasure in my heart, recommend this game, if major changes were just made to fix those problems.  But for now I only just a little bit recommend it - entering an atmosphere going 5000 feet per second, is very cool and the physics is a sight to see (when it works) - ie I've loved playing this game and following through with complex failures, and the learning curve, though steep, has been overall, a wonderful learning experience.  Although one thing I really need to point out, this game is recognized as 'finished' and I gotta say, it is not finished, and does not need to cost more than 15 dollars, as it pretty much crashes on any machine from lack of patches",

Community is still going strong, which I love, modders release interesting and fun mods, and developers are still working hard on it, which also another good, healthy sign. Has everything sandbox needs; freedom and creativity. The only limit is the space and your creativity. Unity 4 was problematic, trust me, I tried Unity 4 before as well. With Unity 5 update, I can run KSP on my laptop just fine with minimal lag.  Now, been playing it since 0.16, and the only reason I say I do not recommend this is the stability of the current version. 0.16 up to 1.1, it went nice and smooth, the only problem was the amount of RAM this game was taking. Other than that, I had fun making space stations, Mun bases, orbit around the Kerbin, and even attaching multiple SRBs on a chair and watch a Kerman break through a sound barrier. Due to the circumstances, I had to put my computers away from myself; and I came back, have my KSP updated to 1.1.2, and with the new version, I am fighting through the game just to make a single ground vehicle and test it around the facility.  For those who are still wondering, I'll simulate a day of me and KSP.  I startup KSP, resume a saved game, and I go to the Spaceplane Hanger, open up a saved vehicle, the replica of HEMTT M978A4. I continue work on it, and I save it often, how often? After I place a single part. Why you may ask, and I answer, because I don't know when the game will crash on me, and I don't want to start over, or even, have my file broken and does not recognize my vehicle as a whole, but as a floating part.  Here we are, on the runway, ready to test this vehicle. Spend lots and lots of time and effort, I hope this works. I press the forward key, the vehicle goes backward. Interesting, my wheel settings are fine. Goes back to tracking station and comes back, ah, now it goes forward. Few seconds later, whole game freezes and tells me there is a dump file. Goes around the forum and threads, people are having simlar issues, some worse than mine.  Really, I try not to give any negative feedback on this game, but the game itself is screaming at me to give negative feedback. I still love the game, and I say you should definitley give it a shot(If you can be patient and go through all the crashes and bugs, that is).  And now that the original creator left the project(and I am sure they have a new lead project manager), I fear that the pace of update/new contents will slow down, which I hope not to happen.  Overall, as an aerospace engineer, this is something I love LOve LOVE to play, and you should try this. BUT, before you buy this, think of what you will encourter; stability of the game and number of bugs in the game. Are you willing to pay the price to be patient and go through all the hassle other players going through? Or will it be yet another game that stays in your library and never get played for at least couple of months/years? The choice is yours.",

I've been to the Mun and built stations and bases more times than I can count. I've been to Minmus and Duna, but have spent the vast majority of my 900+ hours working stations and bases. I've used more mods than I can count, including MechJeb, KIS KAS, alarm clock, FASA, KW, contract mods out the ying yang, ScanSat, Spacey, MKS, OKS, TAC ls and many many more.  I've been playing since 0.25 and up until now, bugs were minor and you could get around them.  Recently, however, even with the 1.1.3 patch, there are simply too many problems with the underlying physics that lead to in game problems that are unpredictable and game-ruining.   I could also complain about the never-ending mod break/fix cycle, but that's not why I'm giving a thumbs down. Someobdy broke the basic mechanics of the game and it's been like that for a while. Up until then, this game was marvelous. Now it's just about waiting for the next surprise to ruin several hours worth of planning and playing. Fun exited the equation somewhere along the way.   Example? Sure. Create a station with a small docking port on the side. Put it in orbit around Mun. Create a small ship and dock. Watch the whole thing tumble out of the sky as the orbit deteriorates in a matter of minutes for no discerbable reason. This is my most recent encounter with the broken physics in the game - right after the latest patch (1.1.3)  Many such 'surprise adventures' have ruined this game, at least for me.   There is talk of a Unity update to fix underlying engine problems. I would wait until then.  If you want more info, read the current 1.1.3 release thread on the forums.

On the plus side, it is the best avenue for teaching the mechanics of spaceflight I have ever seen. I still credit playing this for my current understanding of orbital mechanics, before I had very little concept of the quirks of periapsis vs apoapsis, etc.  The problem is this game is deeply flawed, almost to the point of being unplayable. How people manage to have the patience to build these ridiculous sprawling space creations is beyond me. Most of the time if I build my own rocket, it blows up, which is funny the first time or two. Then I just want to see something FLY WITHOUT EXPLODING. This would be excusable if either they gave some significant help in building rockets, or had a very good avenue for downloading working craft, but they have neither. The tutorial is barely adequate, and the forums online for downloading craft are a sorry, poorly documented and maintained joke. More than half the time if I download a craft it doesn't work either, and comes with ZERO documentation on how to use it. Also, trying to figure out how their tinker toys building system works is extremely confusing. Often I've built something and have little idea how to add something in the middle of the rocket, or tell it which part is the 'root' properly. I like the idea, but the execution is anything but user-friendly.  This is before I even get to the glitches. It's as if they decided sometime during the alpha software development stage 'eh, good enough,' and then rushed the game to market rather than finish their product. Very commonly while trying to adjust my orbit during time warp, it will suddenly decide to drastically change the orbital characteristics, forcing me to use valuable delta-v to correct what is essentially an infuriating bug. This game also DESPERATELY needs a built-in autopilot. You can add one on (which I think is absolutely necessary, I use MechJeb), but I think such a feature should be native. Asking people to 'wing it' with trajectories and orbital mechanics is the most absurd concept I have ever heard of. Would you have expected the Apollo astronauts to figure out orbital rendezvous by the seat of their pants? Could it be done, maybe, but it's an unnecessary and extremely tedious waste of time, adding pointless difficulty.  Not only that, there is little of interest to do. Maybe this is just because I've stuck with sandbox mode, but only thing I can think to do is fly to some planet and land, then often I have to start planning the 'rescue' mission when the lousy craft doesn't fly the way it should and strands my kerbal on Duna or wherever. Just flying is enjoyable enough, but I'd have a lot more fun if I didn't have to work around the lousy interface, the shoddy craft, and the incessant glitches manifesting themselves when you least want to put up with them.  in summation, this is an interesting but extremely frustrating half-finished game that needs a lot more work to be properly playable in an enjoyable fashion.",

Does it make you think in new and creative ways? Yes. So, why then the thumbs down?  I have been playing this game since version 1.7(ish). I have followed its development with joy, and enjoyed being a part of the community. The nearly 400 hours I have logged are just on the Steam version, I also have tons of hours on the version I bought direct from the developer. The features are great, all the new additions have added depth, and everything has really goes well for this game...except for one thing...  It's still buggy beyond belief. I don't run mods at all. I think 0.23 was the last version I ran any because I got tired of the problems. This game is still SO jammed full of bugs I wish they would spend a release fixing all of the universe-breaking problems and put out a truly stable release.  This may be the fault of the Unity engine, it may be the fault of the community demand for big features in every release, or it may be something else. The fact remains that it is still almost a guarantee that building something only moderately complex will result in a buggy mission that you will be lucky to finish without reloading. Even the simple act of building a ship can destroy the VAB interface to where you can't even place parts right at times.  I love this game, but it's maddeningly glitchy. I play it on a moderately powered PC, a non-gaming laptop, and a Mac, and have access to both the Steam and direct versions; there is no difference. The Kraken seems to not discrimiate against any version.  I have to give this game a thumbs-down simply for the slew of bugs that continue to haunt it even after so much development. Any game that requires this much reloading I don't feel is worthy of a 1.0 release. It should have remained in early-access until it was at least stable enough to play regularly without banging your face on your desk.  Perhaps I'm just unlucky and the Kraken has a taste for my blood.",

There are still hundreds of issues attaching parts together and parts just randomly deciding not to stick when you load a ship. They are just now starting to add in types of pieces that actually fit together without your craft looking like it came from the scrap pile.  The campaign is frustrating as can be because of the control issues mentioned above. You will try to make your way into orbit only to find out something didn't connect properly, something broke or for some unexplainable reason you can't do what you want to do and have spent hours setting up. Research is tedious and many of the challenges/milestones you must reach to complete it are completly out of the question unless you can find a handful of mods to make it playable.  5/10.
