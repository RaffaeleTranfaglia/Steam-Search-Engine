Game is now open-world rather than a set of different levels, and Toki Tori now only has a whistle and stomp ability and will often need to use the abilities of the creatures inhabiting that location to reach next collectible or checkpoint location.  The game is a bit difficult to follow initially as there are no instructions on how or why Toki Tori starts out moving in the forest, and what are the things the player has to look out for and to do to progress in the game. Eventually, the game will reward the player with achievements and secret locations for those who attempt to reach the ending and obtain every collectible in the game.",

            "review_text": "Toki Tori 2+ is a one of a kind experience, an underrated gem that brings puzzle games into a new light.  While there are -no- tutorials, many mechanics are introduced discreetly throughout the game, exploiting the only two abilities the player has. (Stomp and chirp) A useful point to note about this: 'Side paths' often require an undiscovered method of using your abilities. These tricks are introduced in different places of the world map, and to avoid frustration, clear what seems easier and head back after exploring other parts of the world.  Some puzzles, often special areas, are extremely tedious. A slight mistake and the entire process starts over. Unfortunately, rewind mode doesn't exist.  *The main problem with the game is sustaining interest of the player during the first few hours. The vague context of the game takes a little away from the experience. (If it wasn't for google, I would still be clueless what the story was.) Tori's abilities feel extremely limited at the start. While you do learn about the environment and its interactions, it feels like Tori doesn't 'grow' for an extensive period of time. (A lack of reward) Moreover, the game is extremely unique and may feel uncomfortable to people who wants comfort in what they are used to. (Toki Tori 1 or most puzzle games) Chirping melodies also seem like a very important feature used to solve puzzles. (but it isn't, it's the interaction a chirp does)   Conclusion",

I am not really a big fan of puzzle games, however I have once gotten a discount card (or whatever those things are called) and the trailers looked pretty promising, so I grabbed it, and I do not regret it. Every level is thought out very nicely and I love how the game combines a platformer with a 2D map which lets you go in many different directions, while still being a 2D platformer. The graphics are really cute and so is the soundtrack and the puzzles have just the right difficulty. While not being so easy that you don't have to use your brain they are also not so hard that you give up and never play again. I can only recommend this game, especially if you have someone else to solve the puzzles together (in my case a younger sister). Honestly, I have not been as addicted to a game in a very long time, if you are standing on the edge of whether or not you should buy this game; if you have someone else to play together with, then buy it. You will not regret it.",

Whereas Toki Tori 1 is a straight up puzzle platformer with traditional levels, Toki Tori 2 is a Metroid-like explorable world, where solving puzzles is the way to get around. Also, unlike the first game, there are no items to use. Instead, different reactions can be elicited from the native creatures by Toki Tori either chirping or stomping. While it sounds rather simple in theory (and some of the early puzzle are), figuring out the correct sequence to solve a puzzle can get rather challenging at times. Simply put, this is not the game for people who hate puzzles or those lacking patience. Those who do manage to stick around for the harder areas of the game will find an enjoyable experience, and will no doubt find a number of easter eggs in the process.",

            "review_text": "Remember those animal things in Super Metroid that taught you how to shinespark? Toki Tori 2 is basically that moment but as a game.  Unlike the first game, which was a puzzle game closer in heritage to Lemmings, Toki Tori 2 is an exploration puzzle platformer with zero in-game text and no ability gating. You have two ways of interacting with the world: stomping and, most interestingly, singing. By alternating long and short presses, Toki can sing big or small notes, respectively. Similar to the ocarina in Zelda games, different combinations of notes will have certain effects. Technically, there is nothing stopping you from using any of these 'powers' from the start of the game. You could, in theory, brute force all of them on the opening screen, but that would take a while. The way the game teaches you these powers at the 'right time' is through little birds that you'll see around the environment that sing little note combos. Copy these notes and BAM you'll learn what that combo does. There's only five or so powers, which was initially disappointing, but I realized that it would be much more challenging for the developers to fully explore the mechanics. And they've done a great job with that as it is. Admittedly, I'm only about halfway done with the game by my reckoning, but the variety I've seen in puzzle design and mechanical interaction has impressed me.   Toki Tori 2 is one of the most surprising games of 2013 for me. I wasn't a huge fan of the first game, but Toki Tori 2 has blown me away with its well-designed environmental puzzles and storytelling. I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone who likes a great puzzle game.",

            "review_text": "Toki Tori 2+ outdoes the previous game by doing the opposite of what Toki Tori 1 did. In the first game, you had lots of powers used to solve puzzles in single screen levels. Toki Tori 2 gives you only two interactions (a stomp and a chirp), but does away with the tradition level format in exchange for a huge world teeming with life. The challenge in the game comes from discovering how the creatures in the game react to your two moves and to each other. This makes the game world feel a bit deeper than most Metroidvania style games, as each section has it's own simplified ecosystem that make up the bulk of the game's puzzles.  I would recommend this game for anyone who enjoys platforming puzzles, exploration and discovery, or anyone looking for a Metroidvania game without any combat that still delivers a compeling experience.",

However, after having put it on the shelf for a year and coming back, I decided to give the game a real shot. And after some initial frustration, I really started enjoying it. The puzzles are really, really well thought out. And only a few of them were what I'd call 'unfair' and required levels of perception I seem to lack.  But given lots of patience and time, it was very rewarding to figure out the puzzles, and finish a level.  What I *do* ding the game for though is its lack of focus, and overall confusing storyline. Nothing really made any sense whatsoever, and I never felt like I knew what I was doing, beyond just solving puzzles. This game lacked a lot of the charm of the original, even though, as I mentioned, the puzzle design was freaking fantastic.  I'm giving this a thumbs up, if you love puzzle games, and can ignore the confusing storyline.",

The world map has that sort of Super Mario World aesthetic, but you can't seem to actually move around on the map. It's just like 'Yep, you're going to this place. Press Z' and that's it.
