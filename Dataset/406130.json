            "review_text": "***THIS IS A VERY LONG REVIEW/THERE WILL BE A TL;DR AT THE BOTTOM***  After a much longer length of gameplay than expected, I'd finally completed Dark Maus, albeit with a sour taste in my mouth. Before you read, please know I am a veteran Souls player. I've spent, literally, thousands of hours in these games, collectively. Also know, that I don't see any of those four titles as perfect. Each one has some pretty strong weaknesses, but generally these are overlooked because the games are so well crafted. I strongly urge everyone AGAINST using this in reference to, or as part of the Souls series style of games. This game differs heavily and it's most prominent features make it more akin to a horror game with action/rpg elements.  Dark Maus left a very sour taste in my mouth. The game started out great. A simple, yet elegant aesthetic, relatively tight gameplay, and it seemingly functioned well. I guess it was all there right? Absolutely not. The first few hours of this game are a sickening ruse.  In my opinion, this game embodies what an outside perspective of all Souls titles is; no story, extraordinarily brutal gameplay, and absolutely no explanation of anything. These are the negative tropes that really drive people away, and yet they account for most of the game.  Towards the end, the game's progression started scaling a wall and never stopped. Dark Maus went from reasonable to insane over the course of one level and never dropped difficulty. Packs of enemies fill rooms, TRAPS EVERYWHERE, tight spaces and terrifyingly aggressive, intelligent enemies. The second half of the game is a veritable gauntlet until the very last boss. The way these were combined made the game feel needlessly difficult. My only drive to finish was that I wouldn't let a cheap imitation beat me.  Dark Maus feels like someone glossed over a list of items to cook a dish with, crossed off one line, and added a few odds and ends that were thought to liven up a dish;   You. Can't. Do. That.  There's a reason why Souls games work. Specifically because there are so many titles on that list and have only improved because of the design progression. For the most part, every subsequent title was an improvement in a core area of the game (I have slight hang-ups with saying that about Dark Souls 2. However, the DLC and SOTFS redeemed the game, albeit at the cost of almost two and a half games worth of purchases and another year's wait to get a functioning product, but I digress).   ^ ***To counter my above statement, in favor of the lone developer of Dark Maus, it is just one dude working here, I believe. Not a whole studio. So, he deserves some credit for making a pretty functional game solo, even if it did rehash most of it's substance from another game series.***  Surely, you must be wondering how a game tanks so shortly into it's livelyhood. To give an abreviated list:  -A lack of ways to counter obstacles (I.E. No backstabs or parries. Staggering is wonky and unpredictable outside exploits.) -A learning curve that evolves into a 90 degree angle at the drop of a dime -A poor iteration of existing mechanics from Souls games -What I can only assume to be less than thought out enemy progression/level design -Literally, no lore -An even worse direction than people perceive of Souls games -Generic and unrewarding boss style encounters (Only one boss was difficult. Artificially at that.)  But it does things differently, and different isn't always bad, right? Perhaps some of the new iterations are positive? So, as an homage that chose to be brave and stray from the fundamental design, how does it differ? Well;  -No on-demand healing. That's right. There is no one button command for healing. As far as I can tell, this was a purposeful feature. Dark Maus' lack of reliable healing was set in place to really instill dread in the heart of the player in combination with another mechanic I'll address shortly. This made each camp fire feel miles apart; contributing to a rather soul-crushing journey. Now, this would be great if tuned PROPERLY, as this became ferociously annoying. Dark Maus felt as though an estus flask system was intended and I believe would have enriched the game; creating a much more fair environment for new and veteran players alike.   ^ ***To amend the above, there are actually healing items in the game. However, they are VERY few and far between and only usable from the inventory menu which you cannot physically move while inside of. Also, the menus are a pain in the ♥♥♥ to navigate quickly, as they feel very flimsy and disorganized.***  -Dark Maus features a semi-unique torch system. This torch provides light in the darker, and most dangerous, areas of the game. It functions on a timer; really reinforcing that dread, as you never know where the next fire to refresh your light, health, and spells will be. This is actually the strongest feature of the game. Souls could never pry that terror out of me. Dark Maus is ♥♥♥♥ing scary.  -The Abilities system. Entertaining at first, grown stale by the end. Sadly, most of these are rendered useless. Only a few really matter and you get enough points to use all of them by the end. So, really they're kind of arbitrary. Honestly, these should have been trimmed down to a smaller list and incorporated as part of the base game design, rather than locking them away and saving them for later. For example: your standard dodge/dash action, which is your best buffer versus damage, has ZERO invincibility frames, as opposed to the natural I-frames given to you in Souls games. While this is quickly remedied through the abilities function, this shouldn't even be considered in the formula, especially when the entirety of the game is a more claustrophobic and hazardous version of another game that's already considered very challenging; favoring my above statement of the abilities being a poor system.  -The world as a whole wants you to die. Seriously, Daniel, who hurt you, dude? I jest, but I've never felt more singled out and targeted before. The land will surround and wash over you with waves of unforgiving natives of a feral mindset. There is no reason, only death. So, this sounds a lot like Dark Souls, right? Wrong. The core difference is that the Souls games are designed with perception in mind. The top down style in combination with the torch system doesn't bode well for being alert to dangers. Most of my early game deaths were because I couldn't appropriately account for what was out of my vision. The game punishes you just for existing, where as Souls only punishes you for mistakes. The Souls series shows you everything, and allows you to react to it. That's a world of a difference.   ^ ***It should be noted that this is more of a design limitation. I could not expect the same level of detail from Dark Maus. However, it does show how taking 3/4 of a forumla and swapping it in where it might not belong inhibits a game.***  So, there lie the key differences. Overall, not terrible iterations. In fact, this game could have been truly unique if Daniel had more time to polish it. Personally, I'm overjoyed to see large studios and indie developers alike take a crack at the Souls formula. It means I get to play more of these awesome games that I love. Especially, filling that void after Bloodborne: The Old Hunters and before Dark Souls 3.  ***TL;DR/FINAL VERDICT***  6/10  Dark Maus was a decent attempt at recreating the Souls style gameplay. However, ultimately it failed, in my eyes, due to being too quick to change certain things in the formula. I would only recommend this game to those who are truly curious and content to get a cheap Souls thrill. I don't recommend this game to anyone who hasn't been exposed to the Souls genre, because there is very little chance you'll reap any enjoyment out of this.  ",

Like Apotheon, DarkMaus' gameplay has a Souls-like block/hit/block combat system, various weapons available and some armour upgrades here and there. If you like Souls games, this game is similar enough to be familiar and different enough to be fresh, if you like Apotheon this should be an immediate buy for you.   Very recommended.",

            "review_text": "Few games indie games give me as much to think about as DarkMaus. It's an interesting mixed bag of goodies that both delight and frustrate you with every bite.  At its most basic, DarkMaus is top-down Dark Souls with a minimalist aesthetic reminiscent of Limbo. It's visually humble and charming, and combat adheres to the same rules that made Dark Souls a success. It's slow paced, dangerous and cerebral, forcing you to carefully consider and commit to actions. Using the shadows as blind spots keeps exploration tense as you turn every corner, and the game teases and rewards observant players with clever little reveals. DarkMaus felt more like my first playthrough of Souls than any other imitator has before it.  Thay said, the game is full of small but frustrating issues. Bosses were underwhelming. The final boss, one of the most powerful beings in existence, would be a pushover if it weren't for his adds. The UI could use work. Scrolling through your inventory is a chore, and why on earth is the B button - which functions as 'cancel' in every other menu - the 'confirm' button in the level-up screen?  The art design has the unfortunate side-effect of making areas feel indistinct and hard to remember, forcing the inclusion of a map. This leads to a lot of glancing back and forth as you try to backtrack to that alternate path you bypassed. I also noticed a few fairly severe and random frame drops and freezes.  The game's greatest sin, however, is the Death Echo system, DarkMaus' unique feature. The ability to bring multiple ally ghosts with you raises a lot of balancing concerns that failed to be addressed. Individual enemies become trivial when you can team up on them, so the game balances this by filling rooms with multiple enemies and projectiles which can be insufferably irritating when solo. Ally ghosts will damage you with AOE fire spells and run ahead to aggro large groups of enemies you weren't intending/ready to fight. They often become more of a hassle than they're worth.  But for all these issues, DarkMaus impresses in something else. The level design is intricate, varied, and hides lots of secrets in its pockets. There's a deep roster of weapons (19) for a 5-6 hour experience. Enemy AI is surprisingly reactive to you. I had enemies react to being repeatedly parried by abandoning that attack, leaping backwards when I pulled out a ranged weapon, and turtling when I relied on counter attacks. And there seems to be 2-3 different ways you can play out the NPC quests, giving a sense of agency I didn't expect to have in a game like this.  Ultimately, if you like Souls, DarkMaus is worth a try. There's enough here to bring me back for another run, and that earns a recommendation from me.",

            "review_text": "Pros:  Thoughtful, weighty combat Eerie, atmospheric music Interesting use of light and line of sight as a gameplay mechanic Well designed bosses and general enemies Doesn't hold your hand - allows you to discover mechanics and preferred playstyles for yourself  Cons:  Simplistic art style Awkward controls Frequent crashes Friendly AI often bugs out, sometimes with frustrating consequences Possible to miss important items early on, making the game much more difficult  DarkMaus is an interesting, generally well made top down RPG which takes clear inspiration from Dark Souls, though it has enough unique and interesting mechanics to hold the player's attention. It may not be as long as a Souls game, but this means that it doesn't outstay its welcome and, overall, is a very good experience for the pricetag.  However, there are a few isues I have with the game and, given the fact that the dev is known to respond to feedback, I feel that they should be pointed out.  A lot of people, including Dark Souls veterans, seem to find this game too difficult in all the wrong ways. I disagree. I feel that a lot of the negative reviews for this game came out of the fact that the players missed a near-essential item that allows for friendly ghosts to spawn and help you in combat. There are three of these items (that I know of) in the game and, without them, the game would have been much harder. These items are found in areas you have no reason to go back to - if you don't find them, then you are going to be at a disadvantage for the rest of the game.  Friendly AI is appalling. I am referring specifically to an NPC who will accompany you later in the game (but also to the ghosts to a lesser degree). He will walk into spikes, get stuck in doorways, blunder into traps, agro onto enemies we have no chance of defeating, and, on one occasion, he couldn't get through a doorway, on the other side of which there was an archer. He blocked the entire passage, so I couldn't get through to kill the archer. He wouldn't de-agro from the archer, no matter what I did. I had to go around the long way ariund (emphasis on long) and kill the archer from behind, by which point my ally had died and required a precious healing item in order to be revived.  One more problem I have is rather contradictory to the common concensus - I believe that there are too many healing items. By the end of the game I was sitting on a large stockpile of morsels and I was able to cheese the final boss by killing his three minions and then simply mashing quick attack while eating them. I never even needed to use medium or large morsels in the entire game - the number of small morsels I had was a great plenty. This was also taking into account how many morsels Destrian devoured in order to get through the fortress of traps which, as it turns out, he never needed to go through in the first place. It just wasn't properly explained what I was supposed to do when I rescued him. I had assumed that he would unlock a door in the fortress for me but this wasn't the case.  Weapon balance seems a little bit strange - it appears to me that if you aren't using a katana and shield as well as having some skill at pyromancy then you are just doing it wrong. Maybe it's just my personal preferred playstyle, but I can't imagine playing without a shield, a quick sweeping attack provided by the katana, and the ability to throw shield-ignoring fireballs if necessary.  Regardless of these issues, I believe DarkMaus is a fantastic game and it is well worth the price. If you are a Souls fan, you would be doing yourself a disservice if you did not play it.",

            "review_text": "DarkMaus takes the top down combat formula and turns it into a brutal, deliberate and challenging format that really gets under your skin.  I would highly recommend using a controller with DarkMaus, you'll still die but you'll die with more dignity.   DarkMaus is, well, dark. It brilliantly uses high, sharp contrast with light and dark (think top-down Limbo) and a limited field of vision to set a great mood and give combat a bit of panache as it helps hide enemies which leads to exciting surprise attacks.  What at face value looked like a simple game of generic hack n' slash dodge/block/stab is a fairly complex and engaging system of meaningful stats and inventory building. There are a variety of fire magic attacks and weapons to use with different damage ratings, ranges and attack speeds to help you survive.   You won't survive but that's neither here nor there. I found that once I realized death was a part of the game I had a LOT more fun with that knowledge. When you die a ghost(s) will spawn and fight along side you and help you get back to your body to re-collect your marrow. Marrow is the currency you need to level skills and is vital.  Combat is intense. Whether fighting one foe or 40 baby spiders every battle is life &amp; death and you have to be very focused and deliberate to win. Quick/strong attacks, blocking, backing off to regain stamina is like a compelling dance and really gets me into the combat in a unique way.  The story is spread out sparsely and the one NPC I found to fight with me and share some of the in-game history ended up aggroing me HARD when they kept getting in my way when fighting and getting spanked. This was irreconcilable. I felt crappy and will have to restart my game but it was a tough lesson to learn.   The campfire system is interesting and I did have issues with it. When you use a campfire you safe, get your health back, and level skills. Also every enemy you've faced respawns. This is good as you can grind a bit without dying but you end up having to face the same group of mobs and it gets a little repetitive and annoying. You want to get through without damage to get farther the next run, and that can be easier said than done.  DarkMaus is a game that I hope does very well as it really surprised me and I think it'll surprised other gamers, too. Plus, combat mouse. Come on. That's friggin' awesome. :3  Disclaimer: I was provided a copy of DarkMaus for review purposes. My thoughts and opinions are my own, as always.",

I sucked badly at the combat, and there were footprints and blood spatter everywhere in the one room I was stuck in. But for all that, the game only took me about 11 hours.  There are some very minor nitpicky issues.  There isn't a way to rebind your keys. And because I can't rebind my keys, there's no way for me to look up the lock-on button for the keyboard-mouse. Finally, this game works best with an X-Box controller. It's rather hard to move diagonally using classic WASD. This isn't really any fault with the design of the game itself, since the top-down movement really does require that you have a joystick.  All told, a very good bargain for 10 dollars.",
