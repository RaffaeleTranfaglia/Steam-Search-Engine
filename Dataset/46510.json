I must confess that I did sometimes follow a walkthrough because I couldn't be arsed to think for myself, but it does NOT destroy the experience since the story is so amazing. Actually got teary eyes at the end.   This is a game worth playing for just the story itself and I completed it in just over 6,5 hours, so just enough for this sort of game. PLAY IT! &lt;3",

            "review_text": "Gorgeous sequel to Syberia. It was everything I expected and more. The story ending was moving and answered all questions.   There were also some great gameplay improvements in relation to Syberia I. Quicker character movements, removal of dialogue options if you've exhausted them all- in comparison to repeatedly guessing in the first game as to whether or not you had asked all necessary questions, zero crashes, and SIGNIFICANT improvement in dialogue quality.  I HIGHLY suggest that you play Syberia I first, and play Syberia II as soon as you complete the first. Helps keep the game fresh and alive, and is necessary if you want to enjoy gameplay as much as possible.   Graphics are fantastic for the age of this game. It's rather like a child's fairytale book at times :) The adventures and gameplay locations are interesting and the characters are fun and blend well with the story. I thoroughly enjoyed Syberia II- and the ending was beautiful. Kate's journey to Syberia was just as much a journey of personal discovery. And it felt as though I was personally vested in seeing Hans live out his dream.  Two thumbs up. Definitely a must for anyone who enjoys adventure games with engaging stories.   I absolutely can't wait for the third installment coming out this year.",

In my opinion a bit harder and more illogical than the first installment, that you need to play before this one for the whole story. It's also a rather short game.

The story focuses on her journey with Hans and his everlasting wish of finally reaching Syberia and seeing the mammoths. The game is once again filled with superb voice acting and an excellent musical score. If you enjoyed the original game you will have a blast to continue the story which is filled with surprises and is composed together very well; the game does a good job giving the player a feeling that they are fully absorbed into this world and are connected to the characters. The length of the sequel is around the same as the original which is around 8 hours. The game also once again shines with logical and well designed puzzles which makes this game an absolute joy to play.",

If you played and enjoyed the first one, this one is more of the same thing and they kind of just go together as one game.  Overall, these games are a mysterious and adventurous experience and I'm pumped for the upcoming third one!",

            "review_text": "Excellent storyline, it keeps you wanting more so am looking forward to Syberia 3! (tbc release date 2015)  Pros: -Detail-rich graphics leave you admiring every scene, and contain steam-punk elements, all set against eerie snowy landscapes that are Russian and Inuit-esque. -More fictional history about the Youkols added further depth and intrigue, in particular epitomised in my favourite scenes involving the dream sequence and spirit woman. -Captivating and imaginative storyline with many architecturally-beatiful places to explore, it was great to see some of the same characters again while meeting totally new ones.  was very sad re Oscar!   -Better gameplay; Kate's movements are less clunky and running from scene to scene is less cumbersome than the first -Music and ambiance were really effective, I found myself completely in the game's environment for the most part   (aka the surprise bear attack!)   -Puzzles were interesting, more challenging than the first but not impossible. -The Youki was adorable &lt;3 A seal-puppy hybrid is always a positive in my book!  Cons: -Dialogue needed some work, exchanges between characters lacked some individuality and fun.  -Kate's character can be a tad bland at times, could be injected with a bit more humour or attitude as I found myself saying things that another person may in a given situation e.g. Bourgoff brothers acted awfully so I assumed she'd be a little more receptive to that! -There wasn't as much urgency re plot as the first so didn't feel as much momentum.  Regardless, I still loved this game, a high 9/10.",

            "review_text": "Syberia II was definintely a would recommend other people to play, but it feels a little sillier (in a bad way) than the first Syberia. The Bourghoff brothers are sort of cartoonish and kind of unoriginal villains that clash with the sort of somber and ornate beauty of the games environment. The plotline with the detective is also kind of weird and feels out of place for this game, as do the weird mid-atlantic accents done by marston and the detective. The puzzles are good though, and the environment is really cool and pretty to look at. The story with Hans continues to be interesting, if a lil bit sappy, but it doesnt feel so sort of fake like the subplots with the Bourghoffs and the detectives. Also tbh the depiction of the Youkols is a bit racist with the whole 'obviously made up language,' how they are all like tiny and round, the shaman's annoying cryptic language and like spiritual insight and weird laugh is all cliche but also kind of an offensive cliche. There's much worse depictions of indigenous people though so i guess its not _that_ bad.   I'd give Syberia II 7/10 stars",

            "review_text": "Overall, Syberia II was a fantastic game and a great sequal to the original.  As a sequel, it's very similar to the first game in terms of gameplay, so a lot of my opinions are the same in that regard. The pros: -I usually prefer point-and-click in the first person, but the movement was pretty smooth, not awkward, not too slow to the point of it being an annoyance (double-click to run, people!), so this ended up not being a problem; in fact, it worked a lot better with the type of story this tells -Graphics were appropriate for the game style and the settings were beautiful and unique -Puzzles were challenging enough for an adult to enjoy, and maybe even get stumped on; this is a good game to graduate to if you got started on similar games targeted at a younger audience - like Nancy Drew - and are starting to find them too easy -Characters were fun, unique, and real; they did not seem boring or single-faceted; you see variety and development over the course of the game -The storyline was one-of-a-kind and not quite the same as any other game you've playing in this genre  The cons were minimal: -The only thing that really bugged me was that the dialogue box often said things that weren't exactly the same as what was actually being said. It was either phrased in a different way, it missed a few words, added a few words... nothing that was important for understanding the story, but it was odd, and I don't see how they couldn't find someone to accurately transcribe the dialogue. It doesn't matter if you are listening to it with volume, like I did, but I found it weird. -Running a round was a liiiiittle bit slow when I was backtracking for no reason or running around trying to figure out what to do, but not enough to be annoying. -The game as a whole is not extremely fast-paced, but it really depends on what kind of person you are + what you want out of a game. It kind of works with the type of game and the story, but some (the impatient?) might find it too slow and thus boring.  As a sequal, it gets points for staying true to the original and continuing on with its story without a hitch. It feels identical in almost every way, albiet is even more exciting because you're reaching the end of your journey and seeing even more interesting people and places.  All-around, it was a great game for me. Whether it's the right game for you I can't say, but if you have a history of point-and-click, mystery games, and adventure games, it's generally so cheap to get these games (they might even show up in a cheap pack -- that's how I got them), that if you think you might be into it, you aren't losing much by giving it a shot. Some games I also have enjoyed that I think have some similarities, though none are exactly the same: Nancy Drew The Hardy Boys And Then There Were None - Agatha Christie Mysterious Island Myst Riven",

Altho, Even that the puzzles were basicly impossible to solve without walkthroughs (unless you are some kind of Genius or a Wizard). I still highly recommend the game, Due to the story and feelz.

The first problem I have with it is the walking. There's a lot of it. Now, in the frist game, this wasn't so bad, as there were lots of interesting environments and characters, but this sequel just feels empty. I understand that, beyond the first village, you're in the middle of nowhere, so it's unlikely to be very populated, but it still just feels too empty, which makes walking around to solve puzzles a very slow and tedious affair.  The story itself is good, it follows on well. The puzzles themselves aren't too bad, aside from the odd one that requires a leap of understanding to get the answer.  As far as the art goes, it continues to be low resolution, but still fairly high quality. There is an annoying glitch with the character's mouths moving way too fast and not syncing up with the sound though.  Tl;dr not as good as the original. Not terribly bad, but not great. Play it if you're very interested in the story.",

Syberia 2 Pros: +If you like Syberia 1, you'll get the same basic engine, style, characters, etc. +I didn't find anything to be overly frustrating, or any of the puzzles to be very poorly constructed.  Syberia 2 Cons: -Settings were a bit disappointing. Maybe my hopes were too high after some of the great level designs in Syberia 1, but these levels felt uninspired. -Puzzles were not as satisfying as Syberia 1. I found the puzzles in this one to be more tedious than enjoyable. -The sense of mystery from Syberia 1 is gone. You already know a lot from what you discovered in Syberia 1, and there's really no mystery added. This game is pretty much just about getting from point A to point B. It kind of feels like filler. -The new characters were mostly bland, and the game's antagonist is just annoying. -No spoilers, but I was not completely happy with the plot. -As with Syberia 1, the game just ends with no real ending or sense of resolution.

Also, there were a lot of sections to walk thtough that were pointless. Couldn't pick anything up, couldn't do anything in them. They were jus there for graphics and when you are running back and forth trying to figure out a puzzle thats a pain.
