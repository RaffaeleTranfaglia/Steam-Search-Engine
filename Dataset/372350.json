            "review_text": "Really enjoying this game, but on release there were a few niggly (small, easily fixed) bugs which are now pretty much sorted. I'd consider this to be in the 'travel defence' genre, a bit like Space Run.  Pro:  -Nice borderlands style graphics. -Good music which really ties in well with the atmosphere of the game. -Literally, a rail shooter. But in a good way. -Each level can be re-played for more cash and better upgrades. -Without giving anything away, some of the upgrades feel really great. -Difficulty seems spot on, with a mild curve, but the game is understandable and easy to learn quickly. -Developers are friendly and actively encourage feedback.  Con: -Voice acting is a little shaky and unbelievable. Should have got some real Southerners! The main voice (in the intro and trailer) is really quiet due to the 'droney' Southern style accent and is hard to hear. -Can get stuck on levels if you do too well - killed a boss within seconds and it made the level uncompletable. (Devs looking into this) -Although the graphics are nice, some things don't appear until you've already gone past them. This means you're costantly looking backwards, which seems odd. It's not that big of a deal, but some missions ask you to destroy scenery which may or may not spawn by the time you've gone past it. (Found out that this is due to the graphics settings - just turn it up if you can.) -Other niggly bugs, like the launcher has an 'empty' button which doesn't mean anything. (Fixed)",

Now i never play railshooters becouse i don't like the whole '' not walking freely '' thing. But this game is really good! You can do special objectives to get more money. (like shoot this, or do that within ___ time )  Music is not exactly in my top 10 best OST of games, but that is ok. A few minor bugs. I got stuck when i came to the first boss battle. But it only happened 1/3 times i played that mission so nothing big.  I recomend this game totally, only missing is the sound of a steam train driving. But do not worry, youtube can solve this for us!         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  TRAIN SOUND EFFECT - STEAM ENGINE FOR 12 HOURS&nbsp;",

Pros:  Art style is nice, animations are smooth Music is catchy Upgrades and progression is balanced and well done.  Cons:  Voice acting isn\\'t awesome at times, especially with certain characters. The accents seem a tad forced. Completing certain objectives extremely early seems to break the game sometimes. Becomes somewhat of a grind towards end-game. Nothing excessive, but there nonetheless.  Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. Hats off to the dev team for the well-polished and enjoyable experience.",

The upgrade system and contracts add a lot of replayability to each level and keep it from getting stale. It\\'s cheap and fun enough that I can easily overlook some of the smaller flaws and minor bugs of the game.",
