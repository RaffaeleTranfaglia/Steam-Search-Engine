For example, the controls hurt your hands and were unchangeable. These have been fixed in the most recent update :)  Pros: - Wonderful Pixel Graphics - Pleasant Soundtrack - Creative Gameplay Mechanic - Very Difficult (depending how you see this) - Cheap  Cons:  - Music Starts Over after Death (gets repetative) - Lack of Explanation (its required to figure things out on your own, vital mechanics don't come as common sense nor are they hinted at) - Very Difficult (depending on how you see this) ",

It seems to have been pushed out early without some consumer testing/feedback... but it's got its good side too, details below.  Beautiful, well drawn Pixel Graphics game, hits the sweet spot for artwork and game mechanics. It's the next best thing I've seen since Flashback and Out of this World... I'd back/buy a sequel to Eron in a heartbeat if I knew the issues about optimization and remapping keys were addressed. The unconfigurable resolution isn't a big deal as the game runs in whatever desktop resolution that's active. (for me, 1080 or 720)   Cons:  - the Village Level (4?) smoke causes serious lag on lower end machines (sys requirements are not kidding) - the controls drop out occasionally (might have to do with hardware limits in keyboards -'rollover') - unmappable controls on a keyboard are difficult to deal with (haven't tried a GamePad yet) - in this platformer 'walk/run' is a painful added button that mostly gets held down anyways. - not having a decent tutorial hint about the balls is, well...'dropping the ball.'  And it might just be that Unity games aren't that well optimized, as FEZ, GunPoint, and Dungeon of the Endless with no issues on the same machine as this game. Hopefully a patch or version comes around that addresses some of the issues, that will lead more to enjoy and recommend this great game! Super diamond in the rough, if ever there was one!  11/10 Artwork+Mechanics 4/10 Controls/Graphics Configuration ",

            "review_text": " POST-PATCH First impressions: [I bought this game on Sale]   First of all, You are able to rebind the inputs and I highly reccomend switching the 'parallel realms' key to LEFT MOUSE.  You run, jump &amp; toggle and probably die in this indie stylized hard platformer. There are Super Meat Boy feelings upon the quick respawn and sense of achievement upon completing these deceptively simple levels. It comes down to muscle memory. Additional game mechanics such as 'long jumps' are introduced to work with the rather minimal control scheme which as of this review has been updated to be rebinded.  If you found games such as Super Meat Boy rewarding after tackling for every inch you get this game is worth trying out.",

            "review_text": "A very nice concept indeed, but the lack of checkpoints as well as the lack of music continuation, means song beginnings are always heard, which can be rather frsutrating considering they sound like good songs. I feel that the lack of character exlpanation leaves me disconected from the protagonist, and wishing there was at least a shred of dialogue to give me the oppurtunity to get pulled in. The scenery is very beautiful, but seems zoomed out WAY too far, leaving the the mysterious protagonist a speck on my screen, which can often make platforming very difficult.  Could be improved, but in its current state, I don't think it's that engaging :(",

            "review_text": "Eron is a rather short one-gimmick platformer, similar to many modern indie puzzle platformers. Unfortunately, the hour and a quarter I spent with it was mostly spent cursing at the frustratingly-designed controls, and I left having given up on the final level and with nothing in the way of good feelings for the game.  The control issue is somewhat strange, since it's not that the controls are unresponsive, but that... well, for instance, midair control is very strange - if you don't keep pushing in a direction during your jump, you stop and fall straight down. However, midair control when being propelled by air currents requires you to constantly push in each direction in order to stay 'straight' in the air current... and since leaving it causes you to fall straight down, this means riding air currents can frequently kill you. It's IMO bad design, rather than bad coding.  Anyway, beyond that, the artstyle didn't click with me and the actual gameplay was rather simplistic as to what I was supposed to do. Once I realized I could rocket-jump off the big black sphere things, it was just executing it that was hard and frequently took a ton of tries.  Yeah, not recommended. I'd say something about how it doesn't even have cards, but since Steam made it so you need to play for two hours before you get any card drops, that's fine for a game of this length. :P  (To make it clear: I didn't beat Eron, but I got to the very final map before I gave up. I feel this counts as having experienced the entire game, but also I may as well note it.)",
