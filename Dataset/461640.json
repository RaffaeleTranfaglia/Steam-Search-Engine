Characters were built realitistically, and with strong backgrounds. Story is top-notch, to which I couldn't predict the plot twists (which normally is a piece of cake for me). Combat kept me on the edge of my seat! Short. but sweet and definitely worth the money for the game. 9.5/10 with the .5 off simply because of the fact that it's an RPG-maker game with low graphics. Big whup.",

The memory 'game-scenes' were kind of long and didn't make me want to play them much since I knew any levels gained wouldn't be retained, but it was fun to actively interact in them. Another drawback of the game is the fact that there were no weapon/armor shops or equipment swap for that matter =/ But overall totally worth playing it once :) Gratz to the developers...",

It reminded me very much of all of the old style rpg's like the original final fantasy's as you can see from the games screenshots.   The only problem I had with it was that I couldn't 'shift tab' to bring up steam like you can in other games; it may have been because I was full screen maybe but I don't know; didn't take anything away from the game of course.   For the price you pay you get a game that I would have happily paid more for, it is worth more than the price it is so it is definatly a steal.  Even if you are only slightly interested in trying the game it is only 79p, stop being so tight and try it :P",

All in all, it's a really good experience, definitely recommendable.  Saying any more would spoil it, and for the price, it's definitely a no-brainer.",

While I can attest that this game will prove little challenge to a veteran Final Fantasy player who knows what they are doing (read: grinding) I will say that the story interwoven into this game was very good. The game was fun and comfortable, by which I mean that it was relaxing to play. I definitely recommend giving this game a try if it goes on sale and even if it's not because it is well worth the price. It is an excellent remedy for those suffering from what I call 'AAA Game Fatigue.'",

The story is very interesting and has many optional side skits that help to flesh out the world of the game. The main characters receive some nice development along with some of the lesser side characters. The combat system might take some time to get acquanted with, but it is much more entertaining than others of this genre. There is even a neat cooking system to help support players throughout the game. I would definitely recommend getting this game.",

            "review_text": "  Sins of the Demon RPG. A RPG maker game that I definantly did enjoy and was a good price for a short fun game. The story is pretty simple. In the world of Lanistra a demon (being naturaly evil) cursed the world before being snuffed out by princess Asuki. That anyone who really really commits to a sin, becomes that corrusponding demon. Lust, Greed, Gluttony, Envy, Wrath, Pride and Sloth. The world is now just coverd with these once human. now demons and they find and attack you pretty dilagently through out the game.SO. You play as Kenshi, a demonhunter swordsman and his brother Shinto, a demon cat... Yes and then you pretty much get the story and idea that like Full Metal Alchamist you are to try to find a way to return Shinto from demon cat to human. Travel from town to town, searching for this cure while killing baddies demons and helping citizens out with a pretty comic routine bewteen the two brothers. Kinda of a modern Marvel comic, kid friendly jokes and hi-jinks. The game music is a little generic for RPG maker games and isnt the most uplifting upbeat for this type of game. There is also just 2 characters you play as instead of the get 5 friends or a huge party to advance through the game. Diffrent yes, not bad and there is no gear. NO weapons or armor to upgrade or sell/trade/find. Witch I look forward to in my RPG game. Again, not bad just diffrent, because the items and such deal more with the real gimick of the game. COOKING. yes, all food network fans will love this part. Find recipes and food like items to create meals in the crafting part of this game. The food gives you buffs, health and such and are made when you find the right kitchens around the game. Kenshi in game loves and talks and yes food and cooking is an interesting part of the game. Witch is fun and keeps the game different. Grab it and play. ! cook and kill ! oh and change your bro back into a human...",

Overall an excellent game that was pulled together very well, would highly reccomend if you enjoy story driven games with a bit of action and some challenge ocasionally",

I rather be neutral about this one, but as you know there are no neutral opinion button so I just choose thump-up   for sake of encouraging developer, since I don't feel bad about this game either.     So this is a Game made by RPG Maker, and there are four type of RPG Maker games in this planet.    Type 1 &gt; Generic looking Generic RPG Maker game   Type 2 &gt; Generic RPG Maker game which dosen't looks like Generic RPG Maker game   Type 3 &gt; Game that Looks like Generic RPG Maker game, which in fact not Generic RPG Maker game   Type 4 &gt; RPG Maker Game that neither Generic looking nor Generic RPG Maker game     And this game is Type 1, which is not good. Why so? Mainly because four factor.    1. Bare minimum of Level design: it's literally bare minimum even within the category of Generic rpg maker game.   you can just check it out for yourself from the screenshot above and Screenshot no. 2 is good example of this.    2. Bare minimum of Combat system: Just for example of this, whole enemy vatiety you can encounter in entire game   is around 10, and all of it's battle is accompanied with ultimately monotonous combat strategy,   which is also Only strategy.    3. Miniature game play: This is somewhat hard to explain, but can summarise as   overly minimized game contents(system). For example, there are actually no 'Equipment' at all.   yeah. this is RPG game which dosen't have any equipment. But this is just one example of this.    4. That Sexy demon monster is 'nothing to do' with this game. That's just a bait and there are not even    the slightest bit of correlations are can be found in the actual game.   I seriously didn't expected certain type of game on Steam at the first place other than use such thing as mild   sexual arousal, but still, using such image as a 'completely bait' is feels like bad offend towards player.     So there are pretty bad things but still, Story is not bad and have a somewhat interesting point of twist,   although nothing near as great. And has a quite good length of playtime for 1$ game. Maybe around 12 hours?      As a conclude, this game is definitely worth it's price of 1 $,   but may not worth your time which you will spent to play,    So just looking into the screenshot above, and if you don't mind overly simplified game with such style of apperance   and fond of Japan style story telling, then give it a try. If not, look other game.",

Maybe we all are shallow emotional creatures, but I'm not enjoy a bit of staying like that.  Dig it deeper than emotions.   The marketing of this game is horrible.  If dev wanted to make a soft porn, then they should do it. However, they did not.  If dev wanted to make a game with a good story, please do not use big-boob-female as cover.  This game doesn't sell its strong point.  In a way, it lets down  both consumers who look for boobs  and those who look for story.  Not because of quality but because of expectation.",
