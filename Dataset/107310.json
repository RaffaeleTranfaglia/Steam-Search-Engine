Its only a couple of bucks for the game but it often goes on sale for next to nothing. If I had the chance I would pay at least $9.99 for it. It's very entertaining. Just be sure to initiate lots of random battles to beat the boss in each scenario. The further you get the harder you have to think because the screen layouts become more complex.",

            "review_text": "A parody of Lovecraft's masterpieces. It tries to be fun, tries too hard sometimes.  If you can bear with the spoiler amount in the title itself, I can summarize the topic as an evil thing loses its powers and tries to regain them by trying to be a nice guy once in a while. A santa with alzheimer, A mermaid with legs, A kitty who is actually an alien, and a hovering sword comes to his help. I did not finish the game yet, I am about to, but I dont think the other characters will be exceptions in terms of weirdness of the cast. Not really well thought or something, and mostly just interesting for the sake of being interesting. The story revolves around our hero, there are some 4th wall breaking moments etc. But actually let alone a few interesting lines in the graveyard, writing gets dull too easily.   Do we need such a title? Parody is basically a thing which is pointed towards too overrated things. At least that is what I am used to. Lovecraft is one of the milestones for western horror genre, if not one of the founding fathers. Nobody reads him too much, nobody mentions him too much, and in gaming, in movies, in books etc, actually if there is a thing, it is underrepresentation. So what is the point of taking a demigod from his book, and ridiculing him? I am not sure.  I am playing this with developer commentary. He seems like a fun guy. I enjoyed my time with him. And I actually think that this notes could be included in Narrator versus Cthulhu dialogue lines. A missed opportunity.  Music is mediocre. Good for a while, gets repetitive too fast. Does not get annoying. Nothing to shame upon, nothing to praise.  Okay, so what about gameplay. I am not that familiar with this kind of RPG titles, so my comments would be coming from a rookie in this genre. But I seriously dont think that having an algorithm as simple as the following for winning is a good sign:  -Press enter repetitively until all of your enemies die or one of your guys get about to die. -Heal, if there are more than half remaining, nuke two or three times. -Repeat.  RPG side is a bit lacking. With each level, you choose an ability out of two for each character. The maximum level is 30. So There are 2^30 'setups' for each character. This is not as good as it sounds, since most of the upgrades are just basic stat upgrades. Mechanics of the game is not well explained, I still did not understand what is making them insane is doing. I dont know whether water attacks work more against fire-like enemies. I am not sure what each Stat is doing, but I am only guessing. And enemy explanations are nothing more than 'witty-oneliners', so there are a lot of missing things here.  Other than that, getting interrupted by random encounters is just too disorienting for my tastes. I played Pokemon before, so I know that this is WAD, but I think experiencing this to the point of forgetting where was I in levels with labirynthine designs with no minimap, remembering it in some 10 seconds, then getting disrupted again... Till getting angry, is no good design.  There are potions. They resurrect or fully heal your party members. Especially for the Ape Princess, use of it is definitely needed. There are enough weapon finds out in the wild, so I did not spend almost any money. Imbalance? I think so.There is a 1UP mechanics which helps u to ressurrect at the same point....But I did not use it as well. Since it basically works like an autosave feature, but a limited one, so instead of using it, I just kept saving and reloading (savescumming) almost infinitely. Since most of the fights were pressing enter repeatedly, not saving does not help the feeling of thrill, only frustration. So 1up was a mechanism which is meaningless. Items were kinda ok, and they allowed flexibility in pressing enter countlessly strategies.  Most of the boss fights were just holding on type wars. Nothing is different except they got 20000 HP this time. Have 1 or 2 healer, nuke until done. A dumb but sadly a valid strategy for almost all of them.  If I were not obsessed about finishing the games I started, I would ve abandoned this borefest waaaay too earlier than this. I pushed myself to enjoy it, I am at about 8/10 of the game now, and I guess I will finish it in 1-2 days time. But I wanted to warn all fellow gamers that, times have changed, and being retro is not a virtue of its own. So I am writing this review after I became sure that this will continue like this.  Writing may be interesting for some, but if I want to read a good story, and only that, I should not be using Steam for that.",

            "review_text": "As an ardent Lovecraft and RPG fan, I whole-heartedly recommend this game.  If you're familiar with Breath of Death VII, then you already know what this game is like. If you're not, read on...  CSTW is a light-hearted homage to both the classic JRPG's of yesteryear as well as H.P. Lovecrafts work. In this game, you play as Cthulu, cosmic horror supreme, who undergoes a bit of a dilemma: rather than destroying the world, Cthulu is tasked with saving it (hence the name.) Along the way, Cthulu encounters many different characters and locales, many of which are pulled straight from Lovecraft's stories. Some help and join you, while most just want to fight.  As for the core gameplay, it's traditional turn-based RPG fare. You choose your options, watch everything unfold, and go for it again. There are plenty of characters to mix and match for your active party, all of which obtain their own unique skills and abilites. The level-up system from BoDVII is back, giving players a choice in how they want to build their characters upon gaining a level. Simple, but it adds a nice sense of strategy. The good ol' 'stand next to a save point and grind out all of the battles in an area until they're gone' strategy is still the best way to break the game, so that's nice.  Overall, the game is fun and quirky. It's not very deep, and especially with the Diablo III's and Skyrim's and WoW's out today, CSTW might seem a little too simple. But RPG's started somewhere and this game does a fine job at looking back lovingly.  If you're a fan of either classic RPG's or Lovecraft, this is a solid buy.",

Possibly more!  Never have I played an indie game like Cthulhu Saves The World before. Seems to be overlooked in every perspective. I would have payed more for this had I known of it before.

Certainly, there are upgrades as you go along, but you don't have to buy a helmet, breastplate, greaves, shield, and boots to defend your character well; it's very much a pick-up-and-play type of RPG. This isn't to say it isn't challenging, however; later battles may drive you nuts until you find just the right party and strategy to succeed. The story is also engaging, and there is a lot of humor throughout. Some conversations are downright funny, and even the narrator gets involved. Character profiles are also winners.

However, there doesn't seem to be any more to them except the very superficial quirkiness.  Gameplay is the usual old-school JRPG stuff. That is grind. Lots of monotonous grind. In the most baffling design decision I've encountered in a while, your party is completely healed after a won battle, but your mana is not restored. It might not sound so bad, until you realise that without Techs and Magics, your party is consistently and constantly getting beaten. So now you either:   A) have to backtrack to a place where you can restore your mana or  B) win fights without using mana. Which is not happening, not after the first area or so.  Granted, the ability to save anywhere and start random fights almost anytime from the party meny are appreciated, but in the end you still feel like you are wasting your time. The jokes, characters and settings are interesting enough to hold your interest for an hour or two, but eventually the monotony of the gameplay and the frustration of the difficulty curve eat away at your enjoyment.",

It has a decent sense of humor and some good replay value with the several unlockable gameplay modes, one of which has a main story very different from the original. Besides that, it has several great features hopefully more RPGs could adopt.  First feature, everybody gets xp once they join your group, even if they're knocked out or not even in the fight. It annoys me to no end when either of these things are the case. When a character faints and I have to reload just to make sure they aren't left behind xp-wise or the ones I haven't had in the party become nearly useless and end up completely ignored because of the effort it would take to grind them, it really takes me out of the game.   Second, every area has a limit on random encounters. Even the overworld has a limit, though it's very high. If you fight the X amount of mobs in the area shown in your menu then there will be no more random encounters. You can also just continue to spam the button 'Fight' button to run out the random encounters for the entire area. It Makes exploring a dungeon to try and collect all the loot so much less of a hassle. Each area's amount of random encounters worked out pretty well too. I would usually just finish them off or am left with only a few by the end of it. And if you feel the need to grind a bit afterwards, you can still call more mobs from the menu.  Finally, the mobs scale in strength in each area with every fight, peaking by the time you reach the random encounter limit. While the enemies don't scale with each fight in the overworld, they do become stronger for the entirety of the map as you progress through the story.  Those aren't the only great mechanics, just the ones other RPGs don't have but should adopt. Very few complaints otherwise. Mainly just how much of a maze the dungeons can become later in the game. Really worth the small price tag.",

Any stretch of any area looks exactly the same as every other. The tongue-in-cheek humor gets old. Very, very old. The game breaks the fourth wall in the introduction, and proceeds to do it constantly. To an annoying degree. The same jokes that were hardly funny the first time are repeated over and over ad absurdum. It felt like a chore just playing it.  If all of this sounds attractive to you, by all means. Get the game when it's on sale, or something. But I wouldn't recommend paying the full price for it.",

Enemies get stronger each round, so you have a built-in timer that keeps you from just turtling and healing. Another cool thing is that Cthulhu has an 'insane' status he can inflict with one of his attacks, that makes enemies more vulnerable but also makes them more dangerous, which is a cool risk tradeoff.  Outside of battle, you have a a random encounter quota that caps out, so if you clear a dungeon of enemies, you don't have to fight any more and can freely explore. Also, you can trigger fights at any time if you want to grind a bit, so you don't even have to waste time running around waiting for them to happen. Very streamlined, in a good way.  And of course the goofy characters and premise are really enjoyable. Basically this little gem is a master class in how to update a classic formula into something that's appetizing to the modern gaming palate.

FINAL THOUGHTS: I beat this game in around 13 hours with a lot of grinding, I got it for 98 cents on sale so it was worth the money...even at normal price its worth the money. The grinding was surprisingly fun(I listed it as a con because a majority of people dont like grinding), and the amount of spells leaves you constantly looking for better ways to defeat your enemies, although a lot of spells become obsolete, some spells you get early on can still be used at end-game for enemy ailments(such as Blind or Stun).

SERIOUS REVIEW TIME!  CSTW seems to be built around its combat system. It's got some unique features that sets it apart from your average JRPG. One is the combo system. Each attack is worth a certain number of hits, and each hit landed increases your combo counter. You can consume your combo counter with certain finishers that deal a lot of damage, plus even more damage based on your combo count. Personally, I found that its relevance faded as the game progressed.  Also present is a soft enrage system. Every turn you spend in the same fight, the enemies get 10% stronger. This forces you to optimize your damage per turn.  There's also a nice design feature in its random encounters; once you fight a certain number of battles in an area, you stop getting random encounters there. You can still manually fight enemies in an area as much as you want, but there's no need to, even on hard mode. (Insane mode, however, is a totally different story.)  Aside from that, the game is a huge parody of JRPGs in general. You'll see what I mean as you play it.  As my recommendation implies, I had fun with it. It was 15 hours long for me.",

            "review_text": "This game is basically the same as Breath of Death VII. RPG-lite with quick turn-based combat, minimal resource management, and a simplistic light-hearted story sprinkled with puns. You fully heal HP after every fight and the game emphasizes on quickly finishing fights by making enemies stronger over each round and giving you more MP restoration for battles that end in a few turns. Forced random encounters in each zone are limited so if you run that number out you don't have to fight anymore in that zone unless you choose to. The music in this one was actually pretty good in some places, and as with BoDVII you can conveniently remap the controls to work on one hand so you can relax or eat something while you play. I accrued about 8 hours of playtime and did a few extra dungeons. Not a bad game, especially since its comes pretty cheap.",

I've been sick this week, and spent it playing this game, it reminded me of being sick as a kid and playing FF7, again.  Zeboyd clearly made this game for fans of those games, but for those who don't have 40+ hours to spend trying to kill Ruby Weapon or get the damned golden chocobo. Clocks in at about 10-12 hours, and it can be a challenge if you try to speed through it. One boss, had me using all my potions and I barely survived.. The random battles can be frustrating, but luckily, after you reach x amount in a given area, the random battles stop. Not only that, but it is pretty funny to boot. Not bad for the two man team known as Zeboyd!",

Both the Cthulhu mythos and the JRPG genre are so clichÃ©d they beg to be parodied. Unfortunately, just throwing both into the mix isn't enough to make it amusing for more than half an hour. The game itself has so many little flaws left from BoD VII it makes itself a painful experience instead of a little amusing joke. It's probably worth the 23 cents I've spent on it, but not the time spent.",

I'm not really a fan of the turn-based rpg genre, but BoDVII eased me into the combat style and CStW expanded upon it wonderfully. If you get both I would recommend playing BoDVII first. What you may be asking is what the difference between the two is.  BoDVII is shorter. It took me about 4 hours to complete once, whereas CStW took me 10. BoDVII however has more believable characters and story. CStW's characters are cheesy and really insincere in comparison, and they literally have to break the fourth wall in order to make the plot work. BoDVII may have been shorter, but it was just the right length. CStW was longer, but the length feel like its there just so there can be more of it, not to expand upon the quality of the game in any way. It has more content, but doesn't do much with it. CStW's combat system is better though. It is much more complex and features the ability to put different party members into your fighting group of 4. BoDVII only had 4 party members.  Final Verdict: Breath of Death VII and Cthulhu Saves the World are both amazing games. If I had to pick one over the other, I would choose BoDVII. If you can geth both though, do it, they're cheap.",

Overall this game is a breeze and will be fairly enjoyable if slightly repetative.  Pros: Witty Dialogue  Alot of characters to choose from  Fairly short RPG  Cons: Dungeons are repetative  Fights are also very rinse repeat and due to the frontal view of fighting it can become very boring as the animations for the players enjoyment are minimal.
