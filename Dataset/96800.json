I think one of the best team throughout the first-person shooter games on Steam, I can recommend to all those, especially, who do not play TF2 game. Good game!  FIN:   Jos tykkää alkuperäisestä pelistä ja yleensä sinun tyyliisi kelpaa nopeatempoiset ja viihdyttävät räiskintäpelit niin tämä on sinun pelisi! Mielestäni yksi parhaista tiimi räiskintä peleistä koko steamissa, voin suositella kaikille niille varsinkin, jotka eivät pelaa TF2 -peliä. Hyvä peli!",

It's literally just an attempt to carbon-copy the arena shooter formula, which is admirable, but it's just not as tight and fast pased as classics like Unreal and Quake were. It is really visually impressive at least.",

Anyway - it's NOT even as half good as original Nexuiz was before Illfonic bought the title. It's shame that it even got into game bundles... If you're looking for pretty looking game in Quake-like style - better check out Xonotic, or if you want something more 'kind-of-realistic' then try Urban Terror.",

There is also about 8 diffrent maps and some weapon arsenal which is cool. My only problem with this game is that it has unnessasary Cry Engine 3 thing. This game doesn''t need it. If it was a blast back then now it's dead. All in all it had pottential to beome quite a good brainless shooter just to chill. 4/10.",

For instance, there is a mutator that lowers gravity allowing you to jump great distances, another that gives everyone sniper rifles and enforces one hit kills. In total, there are 100 mutators. They are the best aspect of Nexuiz, making matches unpredictable and exciting.  It is a multiplayer game at heart (you can only play bot matches single player) which makes the problems with the online all the more confounding. The hit detection is very suspect; you can be unleashing on an opponent but seemingly do no damage. There is a fair bit of lag usually, so it exacerbates the hit detection issues. The player base is tiny too, thus it can be very difficult to find matches.  It's good for a couple of hours play, not much more.",
