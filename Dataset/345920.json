No scares, low fps, enemy doesnt react, died through a wall, stuck in a dust bin, glitched out the map and beat in 8 minutes. Biggest scare was the fps counter, 0/10 should not be allowed on the steam store.",

            "review_text": "Im not entirely sure how I feel about this game.  There are major clipping issues. At the start, you can walk through the truck. Exploring the town, sometimes the camera 'peaks' out through the walls. Most of the building assets are all the same, and the furnitue is non-existant. Even though it looks and feels half finished, what is there is decent.  Audio is something Im also on the fence about. It fades at random while outside. But when it is working as it should, its pretty good.  The objective of the game, collecting notes is a bit bland. Why not have more text in the notes? As it is, there are only a few words per note, barely enough to peak your interest. Some notes trigger a jump scare which seemed slightly out of place (because the monsters never attack or chase you), but did make me jump.  As a side note, as my friend was quick to point out, the bad guys are giant brown boob monsters in heels. And speaking of the boob monsters, becareful exploring the town. When the game goes fuzzy, a boob monster is near. If youre in a building, back away from the walls. I died at the start because I stood too close to a monster on the other side of the wall. And speaking of the boob monsters, they are on fixed pathes. They never chase, they never attack, they just follow their set path and ignore you.  Game play aside, the game lacks a UI. Hitting 'escape' mid game doesnt seem to do anything. There also arent really any 'options' other than graphics settings. No volume slider, no resolution sliders, nada. If you want to play in windowed, you need to hit alt+enter, but the window doesnt resize (or didnt for me at least). When I wanted to quit, I had to task manager kill it. Maybe it was just a freak bug I found, or so Im hoping.  Overall, the game appears and feels half-finished. What is there is decent, but you definitely notice that it is lacking in many ways, gameplay and graphically, which break immersion.  In the end I cant honestly give it a recommendation. The clipping bugs, lack of graphical assets (it bugged me beyond end that the buildings were all clean and empty), and buggy audio are what Id expect from an early access title, not something sold as a finished product. If you really want to play it, grab it on sale, but I wouldnt pay full price for it.",
