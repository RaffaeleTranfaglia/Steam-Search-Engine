            "review_text": "Pro:  - well-drawn and remarkable art design. - good voice acting. - some funny moments / dialogues, jokes never feel forced. - puzzles are easy to solve and straight-forward. Good for people with little experience in adventures. - reappearances of known characters (if you played Several Journeys of Reemus) - Mini-'Sidequests' (clicking on pieces of something scattered around and then putting them together)  Con:  - no hot-spot feature, which could be useful since some items can be kinda difficult to see. - It's short. Took me about 2,5 hours to beat it. - while the voice cast itself is pretty good, the quality of their voices could've been better.   If you are interested in this game, I would recommend you to play the 'The Several Journeys of Reemus' first. These are free flashgames which you can find on many websites, e.g.  www.clickshakegames.com  or  www.kongregate.com . They give you a pretty good impression how Ballads of Reemus works. If you find yourself enjoy it or are already a fan of the series (like I am): Grab it, it's definitely worth the money. I'm really looking forward to Ballads of Reemus 2 now. :) ",

            "review_text": "Great Game. just the way point&amp;click games should be, The World needs more games like this; Bizare fantasy, humour, voice acting, music, well and stylish art. True its short, but short and sweet, with optional hidden object/scavenger hunts to find puzzle pieces. and a really nice spot the difference interface. I quite liked that bit. Being a Discworld fan of old; Comedy, Art, and Voice Acting are what I look for in a point and click puzzle adventure game and the Ballad of Reemus did not disappoint. Exactly the kind of game I look for and I look forward to the Second Ballad of Reemus. Now I go to seek out the Journey of Reemus to learn the Origin of this Mighty Bard.",
