            "review_text": "At this point with a few reviews already under my belt, I've somewhat run out of things to say about hidden object games (or HOGs). With how many there are and the near identical formula used as their base, unless it's appalling or extraordinary I find myself scratching my head for something more elaborate and articulated to say than 'it's good for fans of the genre'. Artifex Mundi's games however are something of an exception to that rule, as more than most casual developers they've shown a desire to strive to better their games with each release, reusing the same basic template but refining it along the way.  9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek so far as I've explored their catalog is the best example of Artifex taking criticism to heart and using it to turn out a more enjoyable, polished experience. The narrative is a fairly predicable Scooby Doo-esq mystery, in a mysterious town full of odd people that seem just a little too obsessed with snakes. It didn't surprise me, nor is it especially well written, but there's a very typical Artifex charm in the way the story plays out as if they know it's derivative but it's the best they can do so they're still going to give it their all to make it entertaining. The voice acting is a significant step up from what they've managed in the past, perhaps thanks to the fact that the characters presented are so strange that any stilted exchange or bizarre inflection becomes a part of the character instead of sounding like an intern was pulled in at the last moment to record a few lines.  The hidden object scenes themselves, though as usual something of a treat on the side to the main casual adventure game meal, feel more logical in how they're placed and presented. Gone are the random cascades of junk shoved into random corners of the environment, replaced with a handful of scenes that make sense in the narrative (though it's still a little hard to believe anywhere in the world is quite so cluttered with pieces of machinery scattered all throughout the town). And perhaps most worthy of note is the addition of fast travel at long last, which eliminates the tedious back tracking which is already thankfully minimized do to the shorter, but much tighter experience.  So yes, it would be easy to simply say 9 Clues is a great HOG and you should certainly give it a chance whether you're already a fan of the genre of not, but I think it's worth pointing out the areas Artifex Mundi has put in the effort to improve their game in a genre so lacking in inspiration or often considered to be of a high quality. It's going to be hard to go back to their older games I've yet to play, but it also has me excited moving forward seeing how dedicated they are to making their games as excellent as they can be. HOG developers of the world, take note!",

            "review_text": " 9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek  is a well-designed hidden object puzzle game by Tap It Games and top genre publisher Artifex Mundi. The graphics are more cartoonish, but they still fit the film noir / 1950s detective theme. I like how the sound effects are tailored to the theme as well – in this case, an old-fashioned camera sound occurs when you click on things. The 9 clues mechanic which gives the game its name is fun even if the stories deduced are a little funny in an out there sort of way.  The game is susceptible to those idiosyncrasies that sometimes occur in this type of game. For example, requiring you to open a pull-tab can with a knife. Also, as a museum professional – ack! Lol the treatment of artifacts. I also had a minor quibble with historical accuracy. Elvis Presley first started making music in 1953, so he certainly wasn't famous enough to be known as the King by the time this game takes place in September of that year.  However, the ending leaves room for a sequel, and I purchased the sequel as soon as possible when it came out, so let that speak for itself. :)",

Cards and achievements are there too if you wish to hunt for them.

            "review_text": "One of the more 'middle-range' Artifex Mundi hidden object games on Steam.   I say more middle range because although it is on a newer version of their game engine and has some of the nice more well rounded UI and UX enhancements and very pretty art (other than the characters), I found overall the story/setting and game play to be a bit more stilted and less enjoyable than some of the others. It is nice to see one without a 'Play in expert mode' achievement though.  The games 'unique' element is the detective mode. You are given a hidden object search with 9 'clues', but it doesn't label what they are.. you are given hints in casual and advanced mode via cursor highlights but I imagine this would have been quite hard if you started straight into expert mode as they don't initially make it very clear how it works.. I also found her 'conclusions' based on the evidence found to be extremely hard to believe.. it supports the story but some of it is barely logical =)  I appreciated that the hidden object puzzles all made good use of real word items and for the most part were fairly logical in sizing and placement (objects that would be on a desk were on a desk for example). While games that mix it up can be quite fun (See the Amazing Adventures series by SpinTop/Popcap) it is all good as long as it is consistent and there are some games that just do it for one or two objects which I just find frustrating.. it's not a clever trick.. it just makes the logic of the world seem even more stupid.  While the hidden object games seem logical, most of the other puzzles seem outright bizzare to be fitting into the world and whie there is some supernatural/mythological elements to explain some of these, others just wouldn't make sense beyond 'the game wants me to put this here to open that'.. which I generally don't mind, but when so much else is trying to make sense it comes across a little inconsistent.  Hidden object puzzle to logic/block sliding/roating/other puzzles is probably 3/1ish.. it felt like there were a lot more hidden objects in this one than some of the more recent games - and to be honest it was quite a nice mix. I felt there was an over-use of the rotating puzzle though.  I often find that since these games have introduced the ability to jump between map points quickly and easily (love it) that sometimes, as in this game, I just open the map up each time I do something and jump to the next point with an 'active' flag. This game seemed to have some fairly random non-connected scenes that encouraged this behaviour and once you begin it can be hard to stop. This is in contrast to other examples such as 'Left Behind - No one on board' where it just 'felt right' to navigate naturally between scenes.  Unfortunately there were a couple of scenes that were hard to find. I think this was due to the points on the map being the start of one or two scenes, so there is a marker that there is something to do there, but you can miss the connector to the next scene because unlike the later games not all scenes are accessible from the map. This also results in indoor locations disabling the use of the map - this is different to when they disable selections on the map because it is inaccessible - and it just feels weird to be told.. no.. you're inside the library - you can't go to the museum now unless you walk through three rooms back to the main door and teleport from the street.  STORY INFORMATION FOLLOWS: I'm not sure if it was the attempt to have the game based in a more 'American' setting and it just coming off wrong or what, but the writing and language used seemed more stilted. Structurally it just felt.. weird.   There are some unsympathetic sympathetic characers, you can tell from the later notes and things that you are meant to feel bad for their situation and/or that they are trying to make the best of their bad situation but the writing of the notes hidden throughout the game is quite a contrast to the dialogue as though written by two different people who perhaps had different ideas, the dialogue writer making them hard boiled and unforgiving and the note writer trying to justify it but it just doesn't work together.     It was also a little strange that you went to help your friend that the bad guy kidnapped for some nefarious purpose - sacrifice/offering? Nope - it's as though last minute he just decided that he should eat her - there seemed to be no point in waiting.. why didn't he eat her before you got there.. unless he wanted to eat you too.. but how would he know you would come.. and there's a whole town full of people under his control he could have eaten - urgh.. this sort of thing annoys me - but I digress.    I do sometimes get the feeling in Artifex Mundi hidden object games that I'm meant to have known something before the game tells me, and I activate a puzzle or do something out of order and then it's not until I go and do something else that the 'back story' is filled in and it clicks for me.. which in their newer stuff is handled a lot better.  There were a few instances in this game where it was like 'I need a lens for the projector' which is great and all - but I'm currently at the point where I don't even see a need for the projector itself yet. It felt sometimes like it was taking away my opportunity to go 'AHA - I need to go back to that projector because now I have these slides that will tell me more'. :STORY INFORMATION ENDS  This is one for those who want more hidden object searches over logic puzzles - there is no way to skip the hidden object searches by substituing mahjong/dominoes etc (as other Artifex Mundi games have done).   This game is one of the shorter ones that I have played recently, and though I don't think I'll replay it straight away to get the achivements I missed (the hidden ?'s, and the achievement for getting all achievements), it didn't make me feel like I wouldn't want to go through it again in order to do so.  It looks like another 9Clues game will be released soon and having now played this one I look forward to it and am hoping it will make use of some of the UX and story sensibilities of the more recent games.",

The bad guy is an ancestor of Sirius Black, who runs a sinister hotel setup.   The puzzles are all very solid, enjoyable to complete without being stupidly easy or stupidly hard. If hidden object games are your bag. you won't steer yourself wrong by picking up this title. (Unlike Voldemort, who should have stuck to his broom instead of a Muggle contraption).",

            "review_text": "9 Clues: The secret of Serpent Creek - completed main story line.  First things first, if you are intending to play this game then I strongly suggest putting it on its hardest difficulty. This is a casual point and click and it is one of the easiest I have played so you don't really need the extra help that the game offers.   This is a puzzle and point and click adventure game. I know that most point and click games have puzzle elements but this one has a stronger focus on them. The main gimick seems to be item searching. You are presented a few times thoughout with a big pile of items and a check list to find them, it's a little bit like one of those games they have in the pub that promises to pay out but in the later levels most likely doesn't even have the items you want to find. The game also has detective mode where you click on a few of the background scenery and your character who puts sherlock holmes in the shade uses her powers of clavioyance to describe exactly what happend! Yes it does stretch the imagination a bit but that's what games are for right? :) On the harder difficulty it supposedly gives you a penalty for miss clicking but I missclicked a load of times to test it out and nothing seemed to change for me which is very strange. Could be a glitch? Or maybe you really do have to miss click like crazy before anything happens.  Although there is detective work I wouldn't really say this is very film noir. It almost felt like a game for children but there was quite a lot of potty mouth at the end of it which was quite surprising for me. It has creepy moments but it is toned down a lot, this won't cause you any fright or jump scare but it is still somewhat disturbing.   The art work is very nicely done and an awful lot of it is voiced which is nice. Only 3 hours of gameplay though although your milage may vary. If you already own it like I do then it is worth your time and is a nice distraction. I have been suffering like mad with my GID over these last few day and maybe I am being a little more charitable then at a more relaxed time, but it took me out of this world for a few hours and that is worth a lot for me at the moment.  I hope you enjoy it! I did!",

Review   = 9 Clues: The Secret of Serpent Creek is not a bad Hidden Object game. Looks like its going to be the start of the 9 Clues series.  Story is good (if not predictable), graphics are decent, not much in terms of soundtrack but its a Hidden Object game, so its not an issue. Playing Expert Mode clocked about 3.6 hours to complete the game with all the achievements.    Remarks   = For Achievement hunters, you might want to check the Hidden 'Clues' guide and/or the 'Lockpicking' guide. The last Achievement is getting all the other achievements so you would need some reading (or a sharp eye and a fast wit). Or you can always replay the game from the start to try and get all the achievement.  The price might be a little too high though (at the time of writing), since its only about 4 hours of gameplay.",

The music is great and the ambience is unsettling, the graphics are well-drawn and the story, while not great, is decent enough.  It's probably not a game for the 'hardcore gamer', as the puzzles themselves are pretty easy, and you should be able to power through them without much trouble. But it's a nifty little game to chill with an afternoon :)  Also, the game - as with many other hidden-object games - is a great way for people not very proficient in English to learn some new words. I spent 5 minutes searching for a fingernail before realizing that 'nail' is also something that you can use with a hammer. Yes, I'm an idiot.  On Mac the game seems to have a broken integration with Apple Game Center (so just press 'Cancel' when asked to log in), and once or twice I ran into bugs that actually left puzzles unsolvable, but overall I still recommend 9 Clues for into hidden-object games or 'light games' in general.",
