            "review_text": "Like always care i take Spoilers maybe inside. So first feeling was and is damn i want go further the way and that with 1 happy and 1 sad eye (4 of 5) so close to the final, to the end, but thats gaming you happy playing and seeing the ending but then you miss something, more levels, more hidden secrets, more quest, more sequels, more games. Yeah the most people dont know often this feeling and this game will not contact the most, that are only loving good graphics or epic stories and get outer between or after the first part and stop. This game have emotions, how Marine fight for the Bear is incredible or how she waits for Bokden, never give up. The story is thin but lovely for me. The times run, its look like Mission Impossible then you get Wolfang, yeah, Bokden let you hang, Bear beat you many times with nearly no chances and the last warrior dad is in ill. Damn so short there and so far away. The level design ist still not boring me and that is hard not to do, sure most people wish more details or hidden stuff.   This time the quest are not 40 but still nice, if you get them, so take care which steps you go, like Secret rooms are many missible things like before. The sounds like always do its best with the budget and dont annoy me (maybe you i cant know it). The animals boss are always great designed and tough, you need the right strategies, the normal animals are nice but could be a bit more, some i really like much for a 2 D RPG. The levels/ areas could be really a bit more places have to explore. The guide is not epic detailed to every single item to find but good (buy it when it has a good discount).  Play all 3 parts before complete and then complete this game nearly 100 % and i hope you enjoy it. As a big 2 D RPG Fan i give 96 % to this part, but take a look first of the game and now if you like this genre. Thanks for reading and i hope you enjoy the game and support the friendly developer :) Have a funny day/ time.",
