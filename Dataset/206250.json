            "review_text": "I own this for the PSP Vita and PC, i have well over 1k+ hours dumped into the game over the years, It's an extremely replayable top-down rpg with the combat system being very akin to the 2d Zelda games, You compose your party from characters you create in the tavern, you can make them look however you want with the in game editor that is easy to use but very detailed, this editor is also available to make your own gear skins to apply to items gathered while slaying monsters or looting chest. There are Many jobs to choose from, base jobs as well as a few unlockable ones. You're allowed to Reclass after you reach a certain point in the game, when you choose another job you retain all abilities/magic, ''Magic circles'' and a fraction of your stats, There are 3 dungeon modes. Story mode, Ran-Geon ''Random dungeon'' and Tri-Geon ''Triple Dungeons'' (Ran/Tri are both randomised Multi Floored dungeons) Really basic summation of the game, It's worth its ''Steep'' price in my opinion IF you have the option to get it on the PSP/VITA over PC do so, But if PC is your only platform then it's no big deal, it's just as responsive as the handhelds and emulated great as well. Thank you for taking your time to read the review, and good luck!",

            "review_text": "RPG with zelda combat and oodles of customization. The game is easy to learn, difficult to master with some pretty complex character customization. And of course it has the trademark NIS grind.  Overall a pretty enjoyable game, though the port kind of sucks. It's at the native resolution (it's a psp game so yeah...) has some issues in controller configuration (it took me half an hour to figure why buttons weren't binding...), and is locked at 30fps.   If you don't mind the graphics it'll be fun until it gets repetitve. Your mileage will vary on that; the regular dungeons mix things up pretty well, but if you do the randomly generated dungeons they seem to be quite similar most of the time and get old. Nothing like Disgaea's item world at all.",

Enjoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of the first game on my old psp and am thrilled at being able to play it on my pc with controller now.  Edit: So apparently I can no longer bind square on my controller for no reason. Also, why can't I use the d-pad and the analog stick and not just one or the other?",
