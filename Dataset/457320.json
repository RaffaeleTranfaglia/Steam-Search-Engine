It was better than I had previously thought. Like playing pong in VR so being inside pong. In 1979 when my dad brought home a early game system that played pong. It was the ants pants and as this reminded me of that time so I now recommend it to anyone who always wanted to be the bat in pong.  ",

            "review_text": "I was lucky enough to get an early access copy of the game on reddit. So while I played a paid copy of the game, I won't let this influence this review.   As someone enjoying sports involving rackets like Tennis or Badminton, I feel like this game is absolutely fantastic fun! Let's start with the concept. You hit a ball with a racket, either with your left or right hand, and watch as it travels towards a huge wall covered by a floating AI opponent platform. Said CPU tries to return the ball and the goal of course is to get the ball past the player. It's basically pong meeting squash. There are three alternate modes: „Zen“ is classic squash, with the player having to repeatedly hit the ball of a wall. Then there are three different difficulties for matches against an AI, each consisting of five games, first to score five wins a game. Players are rewarded points for winning and performing bonus actions like an ace serve, but get points substracted for time spent. In this highscore-based mode it's all about time basically. To round the content of, „Endurance“ has you playing against a bot with only three lives to survive. Fundamentally, you have to score as many points as possible without letting the ball get past you more than two times. While each mode contains more or less the same key gameplay elements, they still all play diverse. Zen is best played rather slow, as you want the ball to travel as slow as possible to be able to return it as precise as possible over and over again. On the three difficulty enemy encounters, I tend to play more and more aggressively. While „Easy“ really is quite easy, „Medium“ already managed to give me a workout. „Hard“ definitely is a challenge and I tend to absolutely smash the ball whenever possible to get past the enemy. Spanning five rounds each, the AI gets better with the rounds played. It moves faster or returns the ball harder, giving you a great progressive increase of difficulty even within the different modes. „Endurance“ also comes with a change-up in mechanics. While the three other enemy modes have a „sweetspot“ zone on the edges of the wall that you'll definitely want to hit, leaving the enemy no chance to reach it, this zone doesn't exist in Endurance. All my play in the three difficulty modes usually focusses on aiming at the sweetspot-zones, making it feel different to Endurance. Here, you need to out-play the enemy, once again involving forceful smashes and quick directional changes. All of the playing modes ultimately have you hitting the ball, but while incorporating the same mechanics, they still manage to feel different due to varied circumstances.  The actual gameplay is absolutely mad fun! The Vive controller just works awesome as a racket. I'm playing in a 3,8m x 1,8m space and the use of room scaling is fantastic. It can be quite exhausting running from one end to the other, though it never seemed unfair in my time with it. When the ball came through, I always knew I was too slow. All in all it feels like a work out, but a very fun one. As hard as I kept hitting the balls, I felt sore muscles just few hours later the first time I played it. The game encourages me to use both arms, as each hand is equipped with a racket. While you theoretically still can play with one controller using forehand and backhand hits, you're way better off using both. I'm usually terrible at doing anything with my non-dominant arm and as the game encourages me to still use it, I think it actually helps me getting better with it. At the start I couldn't hit a ball with it, but it has already gotten better at the end of my first session and it keeps improving. Haptic feedback on the controllers makes the swinging all the more satisfying.  One of the most fun experiences I've had in VR with the Vive so far has been jump-smashing a ball to victory. It feels so satisfying to run and jump, smashing the ball with as much force as possible. It makes me feel really bad-♥♥♥, especially if it's still precisely aimed at a sweetspot zone. The game becomes a frantic, awesome work out on both the Hard difficulty and Endurance, as the enemy tends to return the ball harder and harder. My reflexes are greatly tested as the ball can come back in any direction in my 3,8m playspace width. Smash the ball and you face quite a workout with the enemy giving you a real challenge.   With all the talk about smashing a controller around, I didn't come close to hitting any furniture or walls in my time with the game so far. There's a room requirement for a reason, and I think as long as you have the required 1.5m x 2m or greater, you're good to go. The room scale use seems perfect and thanks to Chaperone, I'm sure there won't be a case of destroyed furniture or controller :p I ended up hitting myself with the controllers though which is a first for me with the Vive. The heavy hitting makes it difficult to slow the controllers down in time in some occasions and thus I hit myself regularly in my first hour. The more I played though, the less this happened. But a short, important advice: It seems crucial to wear the controller wrist straps. All the smashing in combination with slippery hands can make controllers fly through the room. I actually had a controller slip happen to me, while wearing the straps though – thankfully. So remember to use them or you'll regret it.  Visually, the game is looking great. The neon colors are vibrant, though the black largely black background keeps it light on the eyes. The controller rackets feature some cool visual effects, but I would suggest not to hold them directly in front of your eyes – they are very bright. The visuals give me a Tron-esque vibe and it feels great. The sense of space is fantastic! Depending on the game mode and difficulty, you play in a smaller or larger hall. Especially the large one really impresses with the threedimensional portrayal and with the ball traveling longer than in the small room, it's part of the reason why this game feels very immersive. I tend to forget that I'm wearing the Vive and that is always a good sign! The CPU is trash-talking to you during play which is fun, even though its lines become repetitive after some matches.  With the most important aspects out of the way, there are some miscellaneous things I want to talk about. The menus are fantastic, very intuitive. All the modes are right in front of you (though you have to unlock some by completing the previous ones first) and you choose a mode by putting the controller into the respective icon. On top of that, the game has super quick loading times which always is a great plus in my book. I'd appreciate another way to access the leaderboards. Currently, you can see it before starting a new match. As an arcade game pretty much revolving around highscores, I would appreciate a simpler way of having a quick look at the leaderboard. Also, I tend to press the Vive home button when things get heated so I'd wish for an option to disable all button presses while playing. Nitpicking though :) The game feels very polished and I've yet to face any kind of bug.Just a short disclaimer: All of my experience is based on the build that I played on the weekend before official release. I didn’t see any patch provided so I assume the final version is the exact same as I played. As polished as it is, there’s no real need for a patch anyway.    Holoball is a very fun experience and I can see myself playing this every day for some small workout. Three modes with increasing difficulties play more diverse than I thought and chasing highscores quickly got me hooked. The price of 10 bucks is great and if you can imagine yourself having at least a tiny bit of fun equipped with two rackets, smashing every ball the AI is testing you with, I can fully recommend the game to you. If you don't mind a little workout, you're in for an insanely fun game that has you jump-smashing ball for ball like a badass!",

AI sometimes feels a little off (will miss some shots it feels like it should have easily matched with, and hits some crazy ricochets outside of human reasoning), but having it taunt you more than makes up for it.  Unfortunatly (and the devs state this is a fix / work in progress) is the play area boundries you have can make the difficulty a bit weird. If you have a wide space, the AI could realistically hit a corner before you can reach it. Too small, and the AI will keep punting balls straight into your paddles.  Overall a great experience. I can only imagine how crazy the later difficulties bring.  ",

As with many VR games, the look in screen shots/videos don't do the look and feel of the game justice. When you are playing, you feel like you are in Tron playing Pong.   This is a great choice if you want a 'Wii Tennis' like experience in VR (which is way cooler than Wii Tennis ever was).   Pros:  -Very nice aesethetics; great visuals and great sound track -intuitive easy pick and play controls for gamers and non-gamers -intense; a nice work out -trash talking AI robot talks trash at you.  Cons:  -Wish there was a bit more of a single player campaign in the form of a tournament ladder (AIs with differnet names) to give it a bit more persistence between sessions. -game can be dangerous if you aren't careful -Could use a bit more options (music/environment color/changes).",

That's like buying a Nintendo Wii without the motion controller!  Having said that however, the AI games are way too easy. I completed expert on the first try with lots of aces. For a real raquet ball/tennis player, you'd have to go to custom right away.  My suggestion to make this game a long term success is to add ONLINE multiplayer support so you can compete against others. I'm sure you guys are already thinking about doing this. This is VITAL to the success of this title and replayability. Also, can you please add a practice mode that is full speed? I like to play against the wall against myself in real life and I can't do that here without the ball slowing down in Zen mode. Just give us a full speed zen mode so you can play yourself!",
