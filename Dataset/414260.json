            "review_text": "Ironclads 2 has been available on the developers website since August. Clear rules and only a few minutes to understand the game mechanism. But I recommend reading the manual before starting the game. The mechanics well suit the style of naval weapons employed during the American Civil War. Good game with a combination of cat and mouse blockade simulation.",

            "review_text": "If there was ever a game that deserved the “buy it if you like the genre” rating, this is it. Seriously, you should buy Ironclads if you like the genre, and people who are only slightly interested in the game should probably look elsewhere.   Ironclads is a very realistic approach to naval combat in the middle 19th century, a time period that has gotten almost no coverage. Ironclads definitely does not serve as an introduction to naval combat strategy simulations. Instead, it’s one of the best games of that genre available and intended for veteran players and people who are serious about their naval operations. The realism means that Ironclads doesn’t have the wide appeal like some other games and I can’t recommend it to everyone, but it does fit its niche very well and fans of the genre will not be disappointed.",
