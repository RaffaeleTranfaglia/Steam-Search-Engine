            "review_text": "I wish I could recommend this game. The gameplay is tight, the style, graphics and theme are an absolute treat. However, this game fails on a fundamental level by doing several incredibly big taboos.  First: This game doesn't have an ending. That's right, it just...stops. The developer's stated reason is that they saw only a few hundred players reached the end of the latest released 'season' so they stopped and didn't make a final ending to the game. Cool.  Second: The game is divided into 5 'seasons' which basically boils down to 5 'randomly' generated missions (always one of two map types recycled to be slightly different) with one of them being a bit more scripted, like finding an npc or w/e with a boss encounter (usually a slightly buffed normal big baddie). But the kicker that makes this infuriating is that you LOSE ALL YOUR PROGRESS WHEN REACHING THE NEXT SEASON.  These two things alone made me stop playing. The gameplay, looks and theme are great, but that's not enough if you're going to make the game punishingly hard, and then on top of that, arbitrarily take away everything I earned (which is also random, not guaranteed you'll earn the upgrades you like) and then the cherry on the cake of 'hey, the game doesn't have an ending...cuz...reasons'.  No way, no thanks. Such a shame, I REALLY wanted to like this game. Maybe the devs will learn lessons from this game, I hope they will anyway. The game is trying to hard to be two different things at once.  It wants to be hardcore roguelike, but doesn't have the enemy, environment or gameplay variety to justify that.  It also wants to be this dynamic story experience with full voice acting (which is pretty great) but then doesn't actually give you any story beats and doesn't even FINISH THE ****** GAME. ffs  I wish the devs luck and hope the next game doesn't have these same problems and mistakes, so I would suggest getting this game if you REALLY love space shooters/anime/mecha but only when it's on sale.",

The controls are tight and take some time to master, the AI is great and pitting factions against each other feels smart. The game is certainly difficult and will punish you for playing too loose or making mistakes in combat, not unlike Dark Souls.  If you like 2D space shooters and roguelikes, then this game is for you.",

I have been watching and waiting for this day and I am not disapointed (besides the lack of controller keybinds). I absolutely love being able to pick and choose my battles, turn enemies against each other, use the environment, and the flight model and combat in general. This game just feels 'right' to me. The map size and spacing of enemies combine with the terrain really well. It flows so nicely that redoing areas does not bother me at all.  Playing 'Asteroids' at a stand-up cabinet arcade machine when I was young enough to have to use a bar stool to get to the controls is a potent memory from my formative years. Holy crap does Galak-Z hit the spot! I didn't even remember what I have been missing ever since - but playing Galak-Z has taken me back and rekindled the fire of simple, joyful gaming with physics that just 'work' on a gut level.",

Arcade games like 'Asteroids' meet 80's mecha animation and it's a match made in heaven.  I love the idea of levels being split between seasons and it feels like it's the closest I'll ever get to playing a Macross game.  I also love the control scheme on this one. Controls are quite responsive even though it may take a bit of getting used to. From my experience, the more you play the more intuitive they become.  Combat feels instantly rewarding and the game features quite an unique upgrade system that you're likely to end up obsessing over.  Devs also released free DLC for the game in the form of an endless highscore-centric mode.  This mode ended up not being what some people were expecting and many of them saw fit to blow it out of proportion on the game's review section, which is why there might be a handful of negative reviews.   Don't be misled, this game packs a lot of fun for the price and is brimming with style and personality.   A great challenging arcade romp and a resounding YES for this one.

You'd feel a lot more badass not have to struggle constantly to get the ship where you want.  You can pick up blueprints for upgrades you already have. They don't stack. So you can engage that sentinel hoping for some nice stuff and end up with useless things.  Developers. Learn when to have your characters shut up. During the first 3 missions I kept saying under my breath 'Shut the ♥♥♥♥ up already'  While you're trying to learn how to fly the damn ship the game will constantly harrass you with completely useless voiceovers. Shoot an enemy snarky comment, pick up salvage snarky comment, stay still OH STORY TIME more comments. Especially during the rescue at the start of the game where the target will constantly harrass you with an emergency message.

Having a fast auto-shotgun type thing is very different from using precision muzzle w/ charge shots.  I'm still stuck on season 3, I can't imagine what 5 must be like!  The artstyle, you can see from screenshots/videos, but I think they do a fantastic job with how it looks.  Truly a gamer's game -- tight, but deep controls. Unforgiving of your screw-ups. The joy comes from the interaction of it's systems. If you have any joy from 2d space shooting and rogue-likes, this one is a no brainer (also excellent value at it's price-point). ",

But, while the controls and the several ship abilities take quite a while to get used to, it's very rewarding when you do. If you're played Ring Runner: Flight of the Sages, you have some idea of what you can expect regarding the controls and abilities. GALAK-Z does not feature the huge amount of customization that RingRunner did, but it does offer a few choices. And the gameplay is tighter, in a sense - it's much harder, and you'll have to master each ability to be able to complete a chapter.  You're weaker than most of your adversaries. But you have more tools, and you can use the environment as a trap. So you really can succeed.  Again, the controls may put you off initially, but it's definitely worth sticking with. Here's a game that requires a bit more dedication than most, but for a good reason.  Not perfect, but I'm enjoying it!",

            "review_text": "Galak-Z is a 'Rogue-lite' adventure shooter. The story, sound and graphics are good. It's going for an old school style. The gameplay though is Godly. It's so fun to move around, dodge fire and shoot enemies. And being able to turn into a mech is pretty awesome. You can build an entire game around controlling different ships that turn into different robots and it would be fantastic. There's massive potential here for something truly epic. I was actually hoping it would be more like A Link Between Worlds or Order of Ecclesia in space. RPG-like yet more immediate where you can pick up and play for 30 minutes a day and save at a save point whenever you want. A game where you're immersed in it's world with a massive space area to explore or at least one main large space where you can warp to different levels. Where you get to keep your hard earned powerups throughout the game and have to use specific weapons on specific enemies to beat them (Galak-Z Adventure anyone?) Maybe that's too ambitious for the small team at 17-bit. But that would've been utterly amazing. As it is, I still think it's a fun, challenging little game. But I have a few gripes and suggestions.  Although the PC version of the game does have arcade mode, the 'way the game was meant to be played' is in it's Rogue mode. And that's my main gripe with this. I get where 17-bit is going with this but it's just annoying. Having to sit through hours to finish a season to be able to save your progress and then losing all your stuff if you die or when you start a new season is fairly annoying. Plain and simple. At first it was really annoying. Once you realize what they're going for it's tolerable. But 'tolerable' is hardly something to strive for.  The levels tend to repeat at times and are fairly good for the most part. Not sure if all the time and effort into generating levels was worth it. I read that they hand picked the best procedurally generated levels. Effectively you're just getting the computer to pre-make the levels for you.  The AI is good. Enemies will anticipate where you go when they attack and dodge your fire. A nice touch. Some enemies are definitely tough, however, sometimes you can take advantage of some enemies getting stuck in tight spaces for easy kills. And some can be killed relatively easily if you reverse boost such that they're right at the edge of the screen as they chase you and just keep shooting until they die.  Another thing that annoyed me was when, in mech mode, you grapple something, like a box of rockets and then the camera zooms in. What? No, I want to zoom out. I need to see far ahead of me so I don't smash into something or so I can see where to throw the thing. Common sense.  Would be nice and, in fact, I expected to be able to do some kind of combo or something to an enemy after grappling it. Instead the mech just slowly, clunkily bashes away at it until grip is released.  The top left map is useless. I wish it was just a smaller version of the map view map. I found myself always pressing tab or the touch pad on PS4. Speaking of which I highly recommend adding an option to customize the controls for PS4 and adding in slide left and right to L1 and R1 respectively and make use of L3 and R3 (depress left and right joystick). R3 for thruster I guess. I found myself always using the boost anyways. EDIT: Even better -- press R2 slightly to thrust. Press R2 all the way down to boost! In retrospect that seems like a no-brainer.  Oh, and a multiplayer mode! That would be great.  The game as it is is a nice, hard, fun albiet relatively short space romp. But I want to explore the galaxy! The contols are just so good. Maybe the aforementioned ideas are best left for another project or an update but I'm telling you right now, hire more people, do whatever, Zelda in space with those controls is what dreams are made of.",

If you play in windowed mode you can click out the window (and its still fullscreen anyway).  The gameplay is broken down into components - inside the honeycomb where the action is, and outside the honeycombs where there is nothing but asteroids. I bet you'll feel like your going the wrong way in the first mission because it takes so damn to reach the first 'honeycomb' but no your not. Mission objects -- want to do them out of order -- you cant because guess what the obects only spawn after you compete the first objective.  The controls are weird - whats wrong with simply using WASD like in geometry wars, no you have to control the direction of your ship with mouse -- there is mouse accelaration. What this means is you will never want to actually get into a combat with the enemies, every chance you can you might as well just run away.   Okay now onto the voice prompts, in the second level when I went to save 'crash' he kept repeating the same voice-over again, and again (every 30 seconds). Now your player will say the same phrases, after you take damage regardless if you are in combat or not.

            "review_text": "I do recommend Galak-Z, but it is brutally difficult.  Positives:  The art and snippets of story are good, and the characters and enemies say some fun lines (though there's a limited number, so you Will rehear them multiple times)  It is satisfying to pilot your ship/mech: Throwing asteroids into groups of enemies, and filling tight corridors with your laser and missile fire. It is also fun to find upgrades for your ship and collect salvage to buy more.  The core gameplay is great, but the larger systems surrounding it can be frustrating.  Negatives:  To make the game more 'rogue-like', dying means losing all progress on the current level, including all the money and upgrades you collected. Losing progress is never fun, but death can sometimes feel unfair when a while into the game, sword-wielding mechs appear that can easily just shrug off your damage and chase you down for the kill. Spending so long and getting so close to the end of a mission just to die and be forced to restart several times can be really irritating.  The tough penalty for defeat wouldn't be so bad if the game was wholeheartedly training players to improve their gunplay and mobility in combat, but instead it almost always provides a much faster and easier way out. Rather than overcome tough encounters the game usually encourages players to just find and exploit 'cheese' tactics to get through. When blind shooting from off-screen, running  ridiculously  far away spamming shots at whatever is following, or just skipping a tough encounter entirely, is rewarded so much more than overcoming it the traditional way, players dig a hole for themselves later when they can't skip a fight and they get abused by the hefty defeat penalty.  The progression system is another controversial topic. Upgrading your ship is crucial to the game, but after every set of ~5 levels the story will continue but all of your upgrades are taken away. The progression system feels a lot less deep when half the time you're just re-earning the upgrades you had not long ago. (At first I was really annoyed, but after playing Galak-Z over many separate playsessions this stopped being a big deal, I just worried about my current set of upgrades and getting more, not dwelling on what I had lost)  The last critique I have from my experience with Galak-Z is its underdeveloped (or at least under-explained) stealth system. You can see the 'field of vision' cones for nearby enemies, and a glowing aura around your ship to represent the distance away you can be detected. Yet I still didn’t feel like stealth was a very viable option. Enemies seemed to notice me randomly on occasion, and most mission finale areas aren't large enough to provide stealthy options. I'd also love to see some ship upgrades related to stealth, but I don't think there are any.  Overall:  Galak-Z has a lot of room for improvement, but it is still a very fun spaceship shooting, action game. The exploration and upgrading is fun, the combat is intense (because you really don't want to die  again  haha.) And if you have patience and like skillful games, Galak-Z can be very satisfying.",
