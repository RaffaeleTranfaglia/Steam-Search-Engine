            "review_text": "A surprisingly fun overhead shooter. Tough enemies and gigantic explosions provide ample difficulty, but it's the relatively strict time limit that makes Pineapple Smash Crew the game that it is. The player is forced to develop an efficient strategy and work quickly to accomplish objectives, though the temptation to wander and collect the loot necessary to level up can at times be overwhelming. Randomly generated levels and three modes of difficulty provide some amount of replayability and variety, but realistically, you'll probably only get a few hours out of this game before the whole thing starts to get stale. Still, I can see this game becoming a fun diversion to revisit on occasion.",

This game takes the satisfaction of lobbing a grenade at a bunch of baddies and makes it core gameplay. Very well done, and the story going on in the background is pretty interesting too, although not the main focus by any stretch.",

            "review_text": "This game has a pretty good soundtrack, although only one is my favorite. It's featured in the game's trailer. The game itself is simple and fun, but I wish that in some capacity that it were more difficult, or that like the  Giantbomb.com  crew, there were more default weapons besides the regular gun. The grenades are fun, but sometimes the delay in tossing more than one makes it feel like doing combos, as the trailer suggests, doesn't quite work out? It still works. It's just that this game can be so fast-paced that you'd expect to be able to toss out all four grenades in a pinch.  The visuals are cool. The SFX are pleasing. The game itself though.. It's good to pick up once in a while.  It needs more boss types, sadly. I doubt I'll pick it up after they add achievements since I've never been one for hunting them too much, unlike in the game Bastion, where the narrator will often reward you for 100%-ing various portions of the game with a new piece of dialogue.",

            "review_text": "I am not sure why this game has so many positive reviews. It doesn't quite feel finished. It is highly repetive and does not seem to have much variety. The moment to moment gameplay consistes of an isometric view squad based shooter, where you can pick up usable items, such as grenades, shields, health, and other, and you go around randomly generated levels shooting stuff and avoiding having your squad members killed. You can buy heads and thing but so far I haven't seen any items you can purchase upgrades for.   As of right now this feels like a beta, not a finished product.",
