    "description": "LIVE THE LIFE OF A WILD WOLF! WolfQuest is a wildlife simulation game about wolf ecology. Playing as a two-year-old gray wolf in Yellowstone National Park, you'll learn how to live on your own, finding food, meeting other wolves, and searching for a mate. Ultimately, your goal is to find a home and raise your own family.",

            "review_text": " *** Note: I currently haven’t tried out Multiplayer (I have no friends who have purchased this!) but will definitely update if I get the chance. This review, as it stands, is based on singleplayer only). ***   I remember playing WolfQuest back when it was first created, and for its time and the purpose it was created for, it was enjoyable. WolfQuest was (and still is, in a form) freeware and can be accessed via the games external website. If you have never played this game I would recommend trying this out before buying this version, to prevent a build-up of negative reviews that do nothing but show someone hasn't done their research before taking the dive to purchase it.  That aside, this version has been updated with additional features, and with that a price tag to help support further updates and development (not like your usual ‘Early Access’ games, expect new things from WolfQuest. Especially since it looks like sales have exceeded the teams’ expectations!)   Points that I would like to see improved or added :   - Camera:  The camera angles were a significant problem for me. The camera was fixed, with only horizontal plane movement (where the option of movement via mouse was checked). When it came to my wolf using its super powers of defying gravity on the impossibly steep hills on the starting Amethyst Mountain map, the camera angles were very disorientating and only after a short time I had to avoid any terrain that wasn’t a gentle slope or flat as it became physically painful to tolerate after a short length of time – especially when I couldn’t look up a steep hill and all I saw was ground. A similar problem with the scent view where the camera is fixed slightly too low. I hope in future updates that free movement of the camera (vertical ‘up-down’ movement) is added so that players can move it to the lay of the land. Fixing the camera to head movement would also be a great addition, rather than having the wolf physically move to see in another direction.   - Ambient Sounds:  Would love to see an improvement and addition (i.e. more birds/animals) on ambience sounds.   - Graphics:  With the funding through sales, I hope improvements on textures and the additions of assets are made to improve the atmosphere of the game. I can see optimisation and finding a middle ground between younger players with potentially older/minimum specs and older players with higher specs, will be challenging. The game was released back in 2007 however, and I think an update in this area would be greatly appreciated by a lot of people.   - Free roaming NPC’s:  While wolf encounters and spawns of prey are in fixed areas, I would love to see free-roaming animals which would make for more dynamic gameplay. - Advanced tracking: As a tie-in with the above addition. Further signs of animals such as tracks, faeces, fur caught in bushes etc.    - Drinking Water:       Drinking.   - Advancements on Stats and UI improvements:   I.e.  Thirst, Hunger. Easier in-game access to additional stats.   - More factual information:  As I have seen around the community hub, I think it would be a great idea to add real pictures and more in-depth information on the wolves we play. These could possibly pop-up upon certain activities and events.   - Missions/Side Objectives:  Apart from the one, main focus each section of the game, I would like to see plausible side objectives to improve re-playability value.   As the game stands, I’ve had difficulty deciding what to give this review, but in the end have gone with not recommended.   This is   not   for the game being bad! I have high hopes on updates and development in the future and would recommend anyone willing to support the efforts of the team to buy this game as it is currently. But if you’re dubious about purchasing it just yet, please do try the freeware version first! I will definitely come back to this review and update as development progresses and will hopefully change my rating soon! I will also add more improvements/additions I’d like to see or problems as I think of them too.  ",

            "review_text": "Great game. Just as I remembered it from years ago plus more. Fun and challenging. The only real problem I have is the invisible eagle glitch and a glitch where the eagles fly off, magically grabbing your pup without swooping down and giving you a chance to fend them off. Unfortunately, with these glitches it's near impossible to get all 4 pups to the rendezvous site. Hope these gets fixed soon! Over all though, fun game to play in short bursts on singleplayer and great fun with friends. Maybe one day there can also be more after the main quest or even some side quests.",

            "review_text": "It's a good game for lovers of wolves or just wild animals in general. I've been playing WolfQuest for roughly four years now and am also a newbie mentor on the WolfQuest forums and website.  The gist of WolfQuest is that you're a young adult wolf (two years of age) that just left its birth pack in search of a mate. After customizing your wolf, you're dropped into the Amethyst Mountain region of Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. Your main goal is to attract a mate, which would be a dispersal wolf of the opposite gender. Once that task has been completed, you're taken to the Slough Creek region of Yellowstone. There, you have to claim a territory and eventually raise your own litter of pups, whose appearance will take after their parents (you and your mate). For the final quest of the game, you must take your surviving pups to a rendezvous site marked as a star.  There's also multiplayer, which consists of player-hosted servers that can host up to five players per game. There are two options: Raise Pups and Pack Life. Raise Pups is the entire Slough Creek arc of missions, meaning you and your 'pack' (the other players) must ensure the safety and survival of a litter of pups. Pack Life can be anything, really. Exploring or hunting or roleplaying or just chatting. There's two versions of a multiplayer game: public and private. Public servers can be joined by any player, but the chatting options are very restricted. Private servers can be joined only by players who know the password to the server. The chatting options in a private server can vary from a restricted chat (phrase chat) to a very free chat (text chat). There is also the option of voice chat, in which the players can talk by inputting their voice. All of these options are selected by the host.  There's also a variety of improvements and additions. The first is accounts. In WolfQuest 2.5.1 (the previous version), if you somehow destroyed your computer or the WQ files are deleted, you lost your wolves and your saves. In WolfQuest 2.7, your files are constantly saved if you log into a special WolfQuest 2.7 account. That means you can play on an old computer, purchase a new computer one day, reinstall WolfQuest and continue right where you last saved. There's also more customization. In the old WQ, you had a choice of five pelts, a name, a gender, stats and the pelt tints. In WolfQuest 2.7, you get more pelts, a limp, scars, ear customization, a radio collar and howl types. And how about Lost River? Lost River is a new map that takes place near a creepy abandoned city. Trust me, it's freaky. In one part of town there's ominous messages spray-painted on the garage doors of houses. There's no sign of life except for an elk herd in the city, a carnival and papers flying in the air. The other parts of Lost River are relatively normal: mountains and rivers and rolling plains. Voice chat is also new to the game.  I guess my only issues are some glitches, occasional lag and the graphics. WolfQuest is made from Unity, if I recall correctly, so you won't be seeing any next-generation graphics that look 100% realistic and smooth and all that here. It's not unbearable or terrible or anything, but the graphics aren't anything that would get a bunch of praise, honestly. In multiplayer servers, you might experience lag or your video driver stopping and then coming back. There's also some glitches littered around.  Overall, this is a good game. If you want to see for yourself, don't get the full game. Download the free demo first. If you like it, buy it. If you're a fan of wolves and look for a proper wolf game, this is for you.",

You can finally raise pups on multiplayer.  Cons  -I dunno if this was supposed to happen but whenever i make a save file and have pups its the same pup colors everytime also when i look online other people have the same colors aswell which is confusing considering the different pup colors on the title screen. - So i went on the 'bring it on' version with a wolf who had no special bonuses it was a normal wolf and i chased the elk that always spawns right beside you when you spawn, and i was too slow. The elk had half of its health. So i went of that mode lol. ",

I also love the way you have more option when designing your own wolf which now has several different wolf howls.

            "review_text": "Just going to say, it's a good game, but it has some flaws that need to be addressed.   I use to play WolfQuest years ago when it was free and enjoyed it. After coming across a recent let’s play of it I was surprised to still see the game exist and was quick to support it as it looks like there working hard to build upon the foundation they had with the free version. That's great!  You can play Single Player or Multiplayer. Single Player is good to get use to the controls and the basics of the game. Outside that it's a bit boring and empty. You may see an elk once in a while or come across a stranger wolf to chase off or a bear, rabbits, coyotes, but mostly it's a lot of running around and gets boring rather quickly. Multiplayer is where it’s at.  There are two types of game rooms for multiplayer... Public and Private with two games modes, Pack Life or Raise Pups with a max of 5 players per room. You need to know a room name and password for the private rooms as there's no room listing for it to show what's out there. There is a room listing for Public however. Public rooms are restricted to an emote based chat room. Meaning you have a listing of basic sayings to communicate with. Like 'Let’s hunt!' 'Okay!' Whereas Private Rooms have a proper chat room and even voice chat.   However the drawback to the game now a days is unless you know someone or have a few friends to play with you'll rarely if ever get to really -play- the game outside single player.   The issue comes down to people want to join private rooms to have more freedom to type. You'll often find you enter a Public game to play, only for people to start going 'Let’s make a private room!' 'Will message you!' Then the host leaves ending the game. Even if you agreed to the private room, you'll unlikely get that promised message. Meaning its back to public rooms to see the same thing repeat.   You can make your own Public room, but you’ll be faced with the same still, people coming on, asking for a private room, then leave. I have tried being that one that makes the Private Game, sent out the message to the others, but no one joined. Thus back to Public rooms again to see the same thing play out.   I have almost two hours into this game, and outside poking single player to get the hang of the controls. I have yet to really -play- the game. It’s just the same thing every time.  Join game Someone: Let’s make private room! Everyone/You: Yes/Okay/I agree! Someone: Promises to message you! Host leaves ending game. No message ever comes. Did the room ever get made? Never find out. Repeat with next public game you join.  WolfQuest isn't a bad game if you have a few friends to play the game with. But if you're like me and don't have anyone else that plays, you'll likely face this same issue and struggle to sit down and enjoy the game.   So yes, I’d give this a 2/5 just for the fact that it shouldn’t be that hard to sit down and truly play the game with people. When you have yet to play a game after trying to for almost two hours, that’s not a good thing. If they address this then maybe I’ll come back, but for now it’s not worth sitting there for hours hoping you get a game going to play.  For some suggestions: I would love to see more than just 5 players per map. Let you have more than one pack on a map, like rival packs you see in the wild. Let there be fights to take over the others pack or invade another packs area, or team up and form a joint pack. Add in bigger maps with more to them. Right now there’s a small selection of maps and most have the same theme. Smooth hilly Forest area with a river etching through it with an elk hunting zone. There’s one very hilly map with a road going through it, but I haven’t been able to explore it due to the above and not getting a game going. Let’s have more hidden dens, caves, little nooks to find and explore. Let us also play as the pups. Right now the pups have a basic sandbox mode to linger in a select spot, and mimic emotes you do. Outside that they don’t do much.   To end this, there is a lot that can still be done with this game. But when the core thing, -playing the game- is something you have to struggle to get going, it’s not worth it unless you have friends to play with you.",

This game, however, with its real-life sound effects, accurate landscaping and graphics, had me hooked. I have put over 200 hours into this game, and it was time well spent. With every update comes a new challenge, and every new challenge a new adventure. For example, the new addition of the cougar brought several deaths, and much more fun. It had several hilarious bugs, and alot of exploration. I discovered the hill of death, and it taught me to closely examine every inch of territory. Altough, there are a few things I would like to see added. Larger territory. Still in 4 sections, but it should include the nearest hunting grounds. Stranger wolf packs. With the current function, once you have pups, when you enter stranger territory it just puts you back a few steps. I think you should be able to enter and raid their dens, and potentialy conquer them and gain their territory. Despite a few downfalls, this is a wonderful game for wolf lovers.",
