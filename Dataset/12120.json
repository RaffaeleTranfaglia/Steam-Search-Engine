Where filmstars and millionaires do their best to avoid the dealers and gangbangers. Now, it's the early 90s. Carl's got to go home.",

Did he just get an epiphany of his OG lifestyle and is thinking about going to art school? Why is he wearing socks with sandals? How can we see that he's wearing socks with sandals if hes in his car? Why are we, a gang in the corner of a burger joint, questioning this man enjoying some tunes in his ride?   Then the gangsters walked away in silence and became philosophers.   But dat music tho.",

            "review_text": "My god! It's been almost 10 years since this game was released! That was quite a long time ago. And to see it released after Vice City it was a big deal. Seriously, the game employed at least 10 times the area Vice City had. And here there are 3 different cities available not to mention the countryside in between these. This game is huge and just by completing all side missions you can easily go over a 100 hours of gameplay time!  This game still did not have any physics as in order to get the next gen feeling we needed to wait for the 4th instalment of the franchise. But this is not a problem as in case you look at it as Vice City's successor you can appreciate what San Andreas offers: greater playable area, hundreds of vehicles, minigames, car modifications, gang wars and the ability to purchase clothing, tattoos and even to have your own haircut.  I had only an issue with the game's RPG elements: for some reason some stunts are not available at first and you need to keep driving a car until you unlock the next level. To be able to sprint further or have stronger punches in melee you need to visit the gym often. From time to time you need to eat but junk food will soon make you obese. So you need to visit the gym again. These side activities stole some of my time and I never liked paying any attention to them but I had to. I liked how these were skipped in the next episode which, unfortunately, skipped the car modifications and this is the only GTA with bikes in it! And to date, in my opinion, this game has used the best voice actors in the series: Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Penn, Ice T and James Woods just to name a few.   This is a classic and if you like the 'old' GTA games but for some reason skipped this one now is to time to purchase it. Or when it's discounted as 10 bucks is a bit too much for such a title but I'm sure the price will soon drop.",

The title is improved a lot compared to the previous episode, while presenting a linear plot, without much intrigue and twists; many sub-main missions (those wonderful stealth to recover some powerful weapons, or the music game-positioned to play in your car stereo stolen with a ball), so the various locations and different approaches to situations (you can, for to impress even get tattooed images on the body), make this unique title, despite being in effect a PC-game. The more than one hundred missions lead to use of the product for an average of about sixty hours of play, a time worthy of the best Final Fantasy. Our part venal takes over but we must admit that the sixty euro for GTA San Andreas are worth all, a title that will please those who waited for months now, who drooled over pictures and those who grew up in the 90s; after all graphics, sound and gameplay mixed for good are the true essence of the game is not it?",

This is the proper crime simulation while GTA IV is more of a casual game this is more realistic (not physics wise but simulation wise).  If you can't run or afford GTA V, I would recommend this. I hear they're very similar, and this will satisfy your GTA needs (hopefully).   Also don't forget to try out the multiplayer mod that was made for this game, it's great fun!  Good game, worth a purchase!  9/10  P.S. Notice my low playtime. In reality I have been playing SAMP (San Andreas Multiplayer) for a LOT more time than what is displayed here.

So a few years later when I first bought a computer, I re-purchased this game to reminisce the good old days, that was when I discovered modding for the very first time, I remember spending countless hours a day just fiddling with the game files, so it felt like a completely new experience every time I played.   Ever since then, I've beat the storyline a total of 22 times on both platforms, and I've been playing this game for almost 10 years now...

A single playthrough is about 40 hours or so depending on whether or not you like to do much exploring or not (which you should). Personally I feel that the game has aged fairly well, maybe not graphically but then again it is a 10 year old game. It's also probably the most fully featured Grand Theft Auto game (with GTA V coming closer to this then IV did.) with player and vehicle customization being quite diverse and some light RPG elements such as gaining/losing weight, strength, running speed, stealth, and swimming abilities.  Overall if you enjoy the Grand Theft Auto series, games like it, or just feel like you're a black man stuck in a white persons body, then you should very much enjoy visiting San Andreas, whether it's your first time or coming back again.",

            "review_text": "My Opinion About The Game (Without Story Spoilers) : Grand Theft Auto : San Andreas is an Open World TPS made and published by Rockstar Studios . I probaby don't need to intouduce you to the series. I didn't play Vice City (I will and when I did I'll delete this part of the review) and all the others before that but I played all the others after this one. For me it seems like this one has the biggest world that you can actually go to. Like I said I didn' played the other games before this one (yet) but I think this has the best story out of all of them. I like all of them though. The only con I can think of this game considering it's age are the flying tutorials and missions they are awful hard. You can say that I'm a noob but I've seen a lot of people having the same problem. So I recommend playing atleast that part of the game with a controller but overall I recommend a controller for the game because of the vehicles. There's a small negative part of the game which is small because it doesn't happen if you do this like I say , there's a part of the game where you have to take over territories . And theres a small territory named Jefferson Motel. That territory is so small that enemy gang members doesn't spawn there , so you need to lure them from other territories nearby. But if you took over all the territories except that one you gonna have a hard time capturing it. So I recomend capturing that one first. There are other negatives which I did a researc on when I noticed the same things which are regarding the Steam version not the game itself. Rockstar added a patch to the game which removed songs , option for changing resoultions and something with SAMP isn't right either . I played the crack GTA SA with SAMP and it barely had crashes but with the Steam version it crashes at least 1 time in 1 hour but usually around 2-3 times. And they messed up people's saves but that didn't affect me because I got the game after that. I completed the game's story 100% all the missions all the territories all the stats like Respect , Stamina , Muscle theese kind of things , schools etc. I really like the game's story I like the characters I like that I don't have to go to bowling in every second. If you have Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 and SAMP doesn't start properly run Steam in administrator mode and set both GTA SA and samp exe to run in Windows SP3 (on Windows 8.1) , Windows 98 (on Windows 10) and both in administrator mode. This made the multiplayer worked even tho you still gonna have crashes because of the crappy port.  Graphics : 9 (The game came out in 2005) Audio : 9 (The Steam version itself would be 7 because of the removal of some songs) Gameplay : 10 (If you want to play SAMP on the Steam version you gonna have a hard time and I don't even know about what's up with the modding in it , considering GTA V's status on that) Story : 9  Replayability : 8 (8 because of the hell in the flying missions) Value : 6 (7 If you only buy it for the Single Player )  Overall I recommend the game mainly if you only want to play in single player or if you don't mind a lot of crashes then multiplayer too. Well I wouldn't complain much about it after the GTA IV port. Enjoy the game !",

There are still some things the Saints Row series does better (ability to shoot out of cars with more than a SMG, 360 aiming while in a car, cruise control, gang warfare is better), San Andreas is STILL worth playing. Just don't do any of the gang wars during the first Los Santos chapter. You don't get to keep any progress in it when you're exiled.",

San Andreas remains to be my favourite of the series.  - Great story, great music. - Full character customisation - The map is gloriously huge, with 3 different ambient settings - Huge variety with side quests and tasks - Character skill building via gym. RPG element is GO.   K-Rose remains to be my favourite radio station. Everyone else in my house as a child hated K-Rose.  Or at least my singing to K-Rose. Or maybe it was just repeating the whole thing over and over in a badly imitated accent, including the pool table birth part.   One of my favourite things to do, was see how many vehicles I could destroy by parking my car in the middle of the road and shooting the gas tank. You'd be surprised how many people need eye tests. I swear another 10 cars would drive right into that thing without stopping. Best way to make cash, ever.   The 5 star police chases when I flew my plane over area 69, resulting in a hasty parachute down in a complete panic, were intense.   One of the most comfortable games to play ever. If you haven't tried GTA before, I recommend playing this one before GTA V.",

I always wished for a SA multiplayer so I can play it with my bro and surprise we met with the unoffical SA multyplayer what was pure awesomeness and none of the other gta games dont have that kind of multiplayer what GTA really deserves. Too bad that the better SA servers dead or the servers has legal healt and cheatlike commands what you can just put on a hotkey and you have infinite healt.... :/ San Andreas multiplayer was one of my best gaming moments and me and my friends are still talk about it as a good memory. GTA San Andreas was the last GTA what could give you back that real GTA feeling I think..., GTA 4 and 5 are just not the same anymore...

I think this was an outstanding achievment for 2004. But, this is not my favorite GTA, that prize goes to Grand Theft Auto Five. I hear you thinking 'It's the same location!' well it's not. It might be in Los Santos, but when I purchased the game this past monday (On the X-Box 360) I took out the map of the game in the box, and (To my displeasure) I did not see San Fierro or Las Venturas on the map. But overall, I like it better that GTA SA for four reasons, 1, More likable characters, I personally did not like CJ all to much in GTA SA, to me, he got annoying, really fast, and I have not played to much of GTA VC, so I can not make a judgement on Tommy. 2, The vehicles, they hadle much more realisticly that SA, and also show more realistic damage that SA. (Where when you get hit in the side all the doors on that side take as much damages so as they look like thay have been hit by a hand grenade) 3, The weapons, that feel more realistic (Well except for the silencers that things some some major BS) and the the add-ons make them weapons near perfection to me. and finally 4, I love the story in GTA SA, but GTA V's story steal the show for me. (Play them both and you will understand). But still for all of it's flaws, GTA SA is one of the best games I have played. If you can, get both this and GTA V, because they are both amazing.

Story is bar none probably one of the best so far in the GTA Series, second to maybe the HD Universe. Old and new characters alike are involved in this journey of one man trying to restablish his ties with his family, but along the way get caught up in a much more bigger plot. The only drawback and downfall of this game is the relatively large empty areas some cities have contained, as the playing field is very large, but has very little to offer in terms of size and it seemingly feels like the areas could have been more condensed with more focus on one area rather than expanding out with little to see. 8.7/10",

It was the first GTA to have a deep vehicle customization, but none of this 'instantly recall your car after you wreck it' nonsense.

Gameplay: The gameplay is very fun and you can almost always find something to do, you could go to clubs, shoot up the streets, go parachuting, drive around, fly around in a ♥♥♥♥ing JETPACK or do the obvious and spawn in a tank.  Story: The story is beautifully made and there are a lot of missions to go through so you'll always be playing a mission. CJ's character is very well made and his stories with the people around him make it better.  In my experience there has been bugs specifically for PC, sometimes the mouse just doesn't work while in GTA and I can't move the camera at all, which really annoyed me and probably stopped me from playing the game a lot more.  Oh and don't forget all the mods you can download!  9/10 Arguably one of the greatest Grand Theft Auto games made.",

Yay! +There are atleast 10 citys, including the small redneck citys in the rural areas. +The game is rather mysterious at times, it leaves you to explore, and occasionally run in to shacks, that have blood on the ground.

This game would grow bigger and get more sales on Steam if it would be moddable. Heck, even let it have it's own community workshop would be awesome!

I bought the game just cause ive been playing the crack version as i grew up, and wanted to make a redemption. Downloaded it to re-live the old modding times. But dissapointingly it doesn't allow that. Rockstar probably doesn't care about the game anymore since it has newer games to get bigger incomes from.

As for the people saying negative about the controls, they're really not that bad once you get used to them and bind them to the correct keys. Also, there are tons of mods out there including multiplayer, but you'll have to downgrade to v1.0 to play it. I don't suggest modding singleplayer until you finish the game or don't care to finish the game, as some mods can screw up the missions like they did for me. I'd give it a 9/10 just because the controls were bunky at first, but I really recommend this game for hardcore GTA fans especially if you played it on the PS2 back in the day.

            "review_text": "Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is the 6th game in the series and one of the best.  The player takes the role of Carl Johnson, an ex-gang member that just heard that his mother was killed and comes back for home for answers. He is almost instantly brought back into his old gang and for the rest of the game he goes on trying to take over his neighborhood and later that whole state.  Players that have played GTA3 or GTA: Vice City know what the game is like; killing, shooting, racing, and just running a muck. And nothing really has changed since the previous games other then a couple little things like the player is able to swim and not die instantly, flying is easier and parachutes are added, lock on isn't perfect but better then before, and the game adds a fat-fitness part where the player has to watch what Carl eats and exercises so that he isn't too fat and slow or too skinny and weak.  One major thing over previous installments is the shear size of the state of San Andreas which it is about 2 to 3 times as big as Vice City's layout and is full of things to do.  The music is a mixed bag for me as most of the soundtrack is full of rap/hip-hop and the only stations I would listen to was the talk and rock stations and sometimes those got boring so I was glad I could mute the game and listen to my iPod.  The voice acting in San Andreas is awesome as all the characters from Carl to Officer Tenpenny all sound like they are real people in this faux world.  Now unless someone was living under a rock for the past couple years, San Andreas came under fire for having a 'hidden' sex game but was only unlockable if the player owns a cheat device or has the PC version and unofficially patched the game so really the game got a little more heat than it should have. And in this edition that part of the code has been removed totally so players wanting to see the 'hot coffee' are out of luck.  Added into the special edition is The Introduction which chronicles the events leading up where the game starts.  In whole the game is a blast to play and if you own a PS2 you shouldn't be caught dead with out it.  10/10",

            "review_text": "The best of the GTA series, and perhaps one of the greatest games I have ever played. There are no words to describe this game. Yes, the graphics are a bit dated, but that's what ENBs were created for. What matters is the gameplay, story, voice-acting, and just the scope of the world. They run the gamut of ecosystems, from cities and towns to farms, mountains, forests, rivers, and deserts. All of the cities feel plausible, and there's a crapton of stuff to do, from shooting pool at the bar and getting a bite to eat at the local pizza joint, to hijacking cars, running from police, gunning down rival gang members, and best of all, MASS GENOCIDE.  There are a few Hollywood celebrities in the game's voice-cast, including Samuel L. Jackson as a crooked cop (who is the main antagonist), Peter Fonda as a hippie, James Woods as a government agent, Wil Wheaton as a news reporter on the radio, and Andy ♥♥♥♥ as a radio talk-show host who is a bit too passionate about gardening.  The game's setting is definitely influenced by Boyz N The Hood, but later goes into the mafia influences of previous and later games. All of the vehicles have their own unique character, and I'm not lying when I say you can drive ANYTHING, from cars, trucks, and buses to trains and boats to planes and helicopters (including the ultimate weapon for any homicidal maniac, a VTOL jet fighter). You can even get around using a stolen jet pack!  The weapons in the game cover a wide variety, from knives, baseball bats, shovels, and katanas, to pistols and shotguns, to machine pistols and assault rifles, and even rocket launchers, flamethrowers, chainsaws, and miniguns. Hint: go to the busiest highway you can find and open fire with the heavy weapons.  If you do not buy this game, you will not be living AT ALL. GTA V may be the newest and have all the bells and whistles, but we would be remiss if we forgot the origins of Los Santos. And besides, neither of my computers can play GTA V. For the lower-end people, GTA: SA is the way to go. Not too graphically-demanding, and packed full of hours of entertainment and story.  Above all else, though, remember to FOLLOW THE DAMN TRAIN.",

It was on sale a couple of days ago and I decided to buy it and try for myself this now broken and ugly game, that bloody mobile port everyone was running away from and... THE GAME IS JUST FINE! Sure, some songs were removed which is totally stupid and I really don't understand how can a license for a song in a video game expire during time (why is there a need to renew it) but that's about it. GTA SA looks great, as it always did, plays great and handles very good. My framerate is constant (it wasn't on older versions), no texture poping, draw distance is much better now, the gameplay is the same. All in all I do miss the 14-15 songs that are missing, but with time you stop noticing they aren't there (you can always make your own playlist ingame) but that's about it. Everything else is just perfect. It's GTA San Andreas, the best game ever made in all it's glory. I think that today's kids are just too spoiled and therefore trash everything that doesn't meet their expectations. They thought they were getting an HD version (because all today's kids see is the graphics) and they didn't get that.   I recommend this game to anyone who likes video games. This is the definition of a video game.  10/10  PS: I heard that some are complaining that some resolutions are removed. Well, the support is not removed, just the ingame options, you can make custom resolutions easily by using external software found on the web. Also, if you don't want to risk losing your save files in the future updates just set the update options for GTA SA to update only when you start the game. Now when there's an update for your game you can see it first, before installing it, backup your savegames and than just restore them after the update. Shouldn't be a problem because the savegames are easily found in My Documents and updates are really rare for this game now.  GO BUY THIS GAME!!! NOW!!!",

V2 (Australian version) which ran pretty well considering the age of the game but then along came Win 10 in all it's glory. So after some discussion and consideration we decided to try V3 (Steam version) and so far it works very well. My only concern or complaint is the controller config but it's minor and maybe I haven't had enough caffeine this week :) Graphics wise it looks better although maybe that's just us grabbing at straws and of course it can only run upto 1920x1080 but that is to be expected given the age of the game. My machine is AMD FX 8350 - 8 core Win 10 64 bit, 32 Gig RAM, NVidia Titan X 12 gig video RAM Triple 27' Samsung curved screen monitors, Sound Blaster ZxR Pro sound card. so the burning question, Is it worth the money? should I buy it? .. mm that's 2. ok well it is an old game but it's like an old photograph. Nice to pull out from time to time and drift back into fond memories before gravity and aging took it's toll. My son and grandson got me into this game a few years ago and we have all completed it 100% a few times and while I love to hate this game there is something about it that cannot be ignored ... buy it, do it now, you know you want it!",

This would certainly be a positive review, if not for the latest patch (November 7th 2014). That update has REMOVED 18 songs (including tracks from NWA, 2Pac, Rage Against The Machine, Ozzy Osbourne and Tom Petty) and HD support from a game you owned for years. Yes, you read that right. A patch removed content you PAID FOR when you bought the game. That such a thing is legal and was allowed by Steam, says a lot about the current state of the game industry. It sets a very dangerous precedent.  Not only that, but the patch has also pretty much changed the game into the iOS/Android version - buggy, often crashing, with low resolution - and yet, bugginess is not as bad as REMOVAL OF CONTENT.  While the game is pretty much the Game of the Decade for the '00s, I CANNOT with a pure conscience recommend it to anyone in the current state of affairs.

I used to think that rockstar is a good developer, i've bought most of their games including gta v on ps3 but what they pulled now makes all the previous actions not important. Important thing is we've had a good PC game, now they switched it for a stinky smelly piece of crap. Congratulations Rockstar, good luck selling a version of a game worse than pirated copy downloaded from the p2p (torrent). Not many studios can destroy already good game like you do! Better look for a box copy of the game to experience the only true feeling of San Andreas PC(i recommend this version). Digital downloads can easly change the game and rip us off.",

I have given this review a thumbs down as a flag, as I have included a useful fix for a common launch issue in the game and want anyone experiencing that issue to see this review.   For a while this game ceased to work on my system and many others in the forums shared the same problem, that being that the game freezes in the initial launch phase. Despite knowing it was pretty much a broken game, I decided to try it one last time and as usual the game froze on the black screen. I pressed JUST 'Ctrl + Alt' and was about to hit 'Del' to quit out of the game when the San Andreas credits screen appeared. This had not happened since the game used to originally work fine and would not have happened if I had just loaded the game up and left it for a few minutes to boot up, as before I had left it for about 20 minutes without pressing anything and the game had not progressed any further than the frozen black screen.   Anyway, after I had pressed JUST 'Ctrl + Alt' and saw the credits screen, the game then progressed to the menu screen and I was able to play as normal, with the exception of the main video automatically being skipped where you hear the San Andreas theme and see a few art work shots of a typical in game scene (e.g. a 'drive by and shoot', random in-game characters, etc.), but this really didn't matter to me as I was happy just to have the rest of the game working.  So, if this problem happens to you, launch the game and about 5-10 seconds afterwards press JUST 'Ctrl + Alt', but NOT 'Del' and the San Andreas credits screen should be displayed and then the game should continue to work as usual, of course just without the main video - 'Who cares?'.  Hope this helps anyone with the same issue and happy gaming!",

Said physics were poorly implemented into said game, and have caused more than just a few players other than myself a living hell. Other than N.O.E, missions like, 'Freefall;' are almost impossible to finish due to the nature of how quickly one must turn the rudders of a dodo plane to catch up with the jet in question. A dodo--was used to catch up with a JET? 'All you had to do was follow the damn train CJ!' - Smoke.

First of all, the game only supports  4:3  screen resolutions for old crappy square computer screens. My laptop has a  1366 x 768  screen resolution and you can't make that choise with only 4 resolutions this version supports. Second of all, I almost spent a whole day googling about it and trying to find a fix. But nothing helpen me out. Later I found about 200 videos on YouTube about a new update '3.0' which is on Steam only. This patch removed 18 probably nice songs from the game, it no longer supports higher resolutions and it removed  EVERYONES  game data. Every single person who made a video about this whas disappointed, even if he/she doesn't like the game. The most videos about this are uploaded about 2 to 3 years ago so I dont think Rockstar Games will  ever  fix this. I've got a refund request pending on this game right now and I'm waitong for Valve to give my money back. This is probably the worst game I've ever bought on steam or on any platform ever.",

It's a little of a downgrade because I'm so used to playing GTAIV (graphics aren't as nice, etc.), but it's still a nice game for Sandbox/Open World/GTA fans. I can actually see myself playing this game for hours and hours now, despite all the new update has changed or 'ruined,' as some others may put it.  However, I really hope that Steam releases a new update to fix all of the issues that other players and I have experienced. Initially, I felt that I made a terrible investment. I still kind of feel it's a bad investment in its current state. In its current state, I would give this game a 2.5/5. Once the issues have been resolved, I would definitely give this game a full 5/5.  EDIT: Over 100 hours of gameplay later, I would give this game a full 5/5 hands down! There's a fix for the screen resolution issue (don't remember where I found it or what it is, but you can find it pretty easily on the web. Once the fix is made, this game is great! :D Still like GTAIV a lot better though, even if it requires a lot of fixing up on the Steam Platform.",
