            "review_text": "You could easily rename this as 'We Had Lots of Ideas: The Game' because that's honestly the best way to describe it. A mashup of numerous ideas, art styles, and gameplay mechanics.  Let's start with the first and most easily noticed one, the look of the game. It's fairly inconsistant. This is compounded by the gameplay, too. At times it's trying to be Terraria where you're gathering resources like wood to make platforms, at others it's trying to be Diablo with a Mana Pool for spells and skills and exploring buildings you come across. There's blocky, almost placebo-esque objects, but they're mixed in with lumpy, mishapen boulders.. slender trees.. and even animated portals.  You start off with four randomly generated and barely customizable characters, and there's a very limited number of character designs to boot. This means when Sykdemo Thargbiscuit dies, there's a very good chance that Archibald Roundabout will take their place and look exactly the same. Except their stats may be slighty different, and depending on how far you were before you died, a lot worse. This also means you may have to go from playing a ranged mage to a melee meathead with little say in the matter.  Unlike, say, Rogue Legacy which does this with a charming upgrade system and consistant, yet progressive stats, A Valley Without Wind just kinda.. well, tosses the player into the wind. Oh, and you'll die a lot, to be sure. If not from actual mobs (which is very likely as you have no clue what you're doing, and the User Interface is clunky and unhelpful), then you're sure to die of boredom as you repeat the same handful of tasks over and over again.  I got the game ages ago as part of a bundle because I thought it'd be a fun Metroidvania sort of title, and at first glance it definitely seemed like it might be. Unfortunately, the other thing AVWW reeks of is the feeling that it's unfinished. It's pretty clear the developers got partway through progress of making the game, given it's bizarre title screen which features 'asking for your key', a blurb about the aforementioned progress which hasn't updated in forever, and a scrolling storyline summary which is about as much as I ever got for plot.  Even free it didn't feel worth it. I just hope the bundle came with other games I actually enjoyed, but it was so long ago I have no idea anymore. I can definitely tell you that unless the sequel is made out of ♥♥♥♥♥♥s and maybe chocolate, it probably isn't worth the $15 it's currently sitting at, either.  As an aside, I've read that there is eventually city building. Sadly, the game just couldn't keep my interest long enough to actually make it that far. From what I understand from a friend who has played it, and a few other reviews.. you don't get the sense of progression you ought to in a game like this. Once you 'complete' an island with rebuilding, bosses, and so forth, you just go off and repeat it and this happens ad nauseum. Given how the general gameplay was so unpolished, I can't imagine the rebuilding stage of it to be any better.",

            "review_text": "There's a lot to love in A Valley Without Wind - freedom and exploration in a randomly-generated world, crafting and upgrades, lots of perilous platforming challenges and a Rogue Legacy-style new hero system - but the experience is somewhat marred by the fact that the game looks like something that would barely pass muster for freeware back in the 90's. If you can past the somewhat dated visuals (although it can hit 60FPS, which is always nice), there's much fun to be had.  Just be mindful that this isn't really a game that holds your hand - as each playthrough is never the same, you may be frustrated at the fact that there's no real direction or point in the beginning. Stick with it, and you'll learn to love it.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to like A Valley Without Wind (AVWW), but the reality is it feels like a game made by a small group of friends specifically for that group of friends to play together. That is to say it has a very small target audience and I fall outside of that scope. In terms of style AVWW lies somewhere between SNES Contra and Terraria, but it lacks the former's solid action and level design, and lacks the latter's ability to let players build (or destroy) a world block by block. The combat in AVWW is often simple yet frustrating, where you can easily get stuck, stunlocked, and annihilated by simple monsters due to poor design. What’s more, is the game punishes players for exploring too much by advancing ALL monster levels after you explore a certain amount, yet exploration is necessary to even face regular challenges – which is to say that pacing is very awkward. On the whole AVWW feels punishing to play at times, without offering any real sensation of accomplishment.",

            "review_text": "I heartily recommend A Valley Without Wind.  In true Arcen fashion this is a different kind of game. It is quite unlike anything else, it's a 2D sidescrolling exploration game with an incredible amount of spells, each of them different and fun to use.  Arcen also went ahead and developed a sequel, which supposedly fixes the problems of the game. This is because the original didn't turn out as they had originally intended. However I must say that I disagree with them (and apparently many others as well), I think the original game is far superior to the sequel. It is much more interesting, it gives you more freedom, there are many more possibilities and it also looks better (although the visuals in this game are certainly something you need to get used to)  The best way to realise whether or not you want to play this game is to check out the screenshots or watch a video, and if it looks like it might be something you'd enjoy then you really should go ahead and play the game because this game really is unique and you owe it to yourself to experience it. However if you don't see anything appealing here, then just move on to something else because it is unlikely that the game will win you over.  This game definitely isn't a crow pleaser, but I managed to find great enjoyment playing it and I hope you do too!  8 / 10",

A world setting that brings the ice age right next to post-apolcalyptic wastelands, time and space are in trouble and only you can fix the world. With magic, tech, lots of bossfights and exploration of most of the time at least partly destructable enviroments. When you have done that it doesn't stop.. since you have to try to keep humanity alive by managing the villages and bringing the continents up to speed again. You will die, your succesors will inherit your quest and your tools but.. every character will be different. If you are the type to really explore and don't stop until you find everything.. this is made for you. If you like to just do the minimium to get the story going.. you can do that too. You will just miss a lot of hidden stuff. Highly replayable and recommenced to everyone who likes metroidvania-like games.",

You build buildings that buff you. you gather components to write spells, and you gather gear. When you feel buff and badass, you go kill a boss, and everything gets harder. With each boss, more stuff to do is introduced, and you learn more about the story.  Most of AVWW is exploration. You enter a landmark on the map and begin exploring, looking for loot to make you more powerful. Completionists will go insane: you have to identify what's worth your time exploring and what's not. In that way the experience is clean and streamlined. You see on your map a room that has stuff worth your time in it and go; otherwise you move on.  All in all, damn addictive and engagin",
