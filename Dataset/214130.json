Customer support for this game ignores you and does not answer communications. The web site for this indicates re-installs are not permitted and the game MUST be re-purchased. Not only is this a violation of Steam TOS but it is also fraud, total sham!",

            "review_text": "High quality graphics and very smooth keyboard controls make this an excellent flight sim. The detail on the aircraft itself is impressive, ranging from seeing the steering components actually move to minimal, but visible, damage on the airplane. Landing and taking off is simplified.  The biggest issue I have with Aerofly is the quality of the environment. Clouds are not highly detailed and the ground is very barren. The occasional cluster of buildings you might fly over (or through), are the 'large cities,' while the rest of the landscape has nothing besides Google Earth-like textures. The mountains are nicely done though.  Overall, if you are looking for an easy to pick up, quick to learn flight sim, it's hard to do better than Aerofly FS, but if you are looking for a serious, challenging, realistic flight simulator, look elsewhere, such as MS flight sim. It will entertain you, but not really challenge you.",

IF SO THIS GAME IS FOR YOU!!!  any way it's perfect for flying semi realistic flying because flying planes is hard or else cars would not be a thing any more, also the land scape is smash your brains outwith a bar of gold beutiful. few problems it doesnt run on many computers, the water in the game is solid terrain... and lots of it looks like google maps towns. but i like it better that microsoft flight sim and doesn't my opion matter right now or else you would not of read this...",

            "review_text": "Fun for about an hour or two and that's about it. It's quite basic and the map size is literally the Swiss Alps only. I thought (before purchasing) that this was a true flight sim with an entire World size map to fly in. Nope. And the controls are quite basic and they are not many key functions to customize. I am a bit disappointed with all of the positive reviews of this. I had considered not buying this but I read a few of the nice reviews and thought (why not give it a go). But now after playing it hopefully I can get my money back because I believe those positive reviews to be fake and misleading. Unless you have no idea about flight-sims, STAY AWAY from this one!",
