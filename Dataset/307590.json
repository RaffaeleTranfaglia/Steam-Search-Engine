            "review_text": "Have you ever felt your life is boring, have you ever wanted some big change? Willy, the farmer's overweight kid, wanted. Farmer's work wasn't exciting at all for him, so when he met a suspicious guy with a mask who offered him a ride in his wagon, he wanted to have an amazing journey for a day. But, oh boy, he was stupid. The masked guy locked up Willy until they arrived to the sadistic circus, Penarium. And now it's up to you - can you survive in control of Willy?   Penarium is a platformer with priority on difficulty and simple controls - all you can do is running and (double) jumping. You are thrown into the circus arena where you have to do specific tasks (break barrels, burst balloons or push buttons in specific order) while dodging deadly traps. There are no lives nor checkpoints, you just have to do your best or... try again.  What I've really liked on Penarium is the whole pixelart graphics style with cool animation work. There isn't much environment variety (only 3 circus arenas) but there is fair amount of traps that can make every level a little different (well, from what I've seen, only the order of traps is random, but that's still something if you're dying often). Also, the game has pretty good soundtrack with circus melodies that can extend your hate towards circus and clowns, especially because of the overall higher difficulty the game has.  I've already broached the subject of length with low amount of environment variety and, well, that's the biggest downside of Penarium. There are only 30 levels (challenges) that can be done in pretty short time, depending on your skill and experience with platformers. To those who want more, there is an arcade mode where you also collect coins to get bonuses for that mode. If you have a friend to play with, there are also co-op and versus modes. But I guess that's not enough to those who expect some sort of main campaign with stable unlocking of game's content.   Conclusion:",

I hope Willy gets to do some other things except from jumping and running in the sequel (if there is one?).  10/10 would recommend! \\(^_^)/",

This game was way easier than I expected based on the reviews I read. It's still challenging in a good way and gives you good 2-3 hours. I still have 3 achievements left, of which 2 require a certain amount of deaths.   Playing through the game I didn't even reach 250 deaths and the other one requires 1000 deaths. It'll take a lot of time, but maybe I'll reach them while trying to smash 150 barrells in the arcade mode.",

Didn't try multiplayer yet, but I can't imagine it not being fun, I don't see my self playing MP much as it's 2 players only, and lacks content.  I can't recommend the game with lack of content and fps issues I'm getting on 980m/9700k, its unacceptable, I'm in the top 80 in arcade mode with out any upgrades and on my first try, so I know when a game is supposed to be responsive.  tl;dr + Fun creative and simple, could be a lot of fun in multiplayer.  - Lack of content and overall polish, with constant FPS issues. - Multiplayer is 2 players only. - Poor level design resulting in cheap deaths.  *Buy for 2$ or less.",
