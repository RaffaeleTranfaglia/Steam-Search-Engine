            "review_text": "8BitMMO, created by Robby Zinchak aka RobbyZ is a old school styled Free Roam Rpg. 8BitMMO is a game that takes inspiration from many games such as Minecraft, Legend of Zelda, and even Mario. In 8BitMMO you start off waking up in a man's house who is completely aware that he is in a video game by breaking the 4th wall. He sends you off to complete quests in order to just get you out of his house, he references that he has done this multiple times and that strangers waking up in his house has become a common problem for him. This snarky dialogue made me enjoy my first 10 minutes of the game, as it reminded me of dialogue coming from games like Saints Row. I love it when games make fun of the fact that it is a game. Unfortunately after the tutorial this dialogue seemed to cease and enjoyment of my gameplay experience began to decrease more and more. The combat in 8BitMMO is simple enough to play with one hand, with occasionaly reaching for your mouse. Only having the WASD keys for movement and the space bar for attacking made hunting quests and fighting off enemies a bore after the tutorial. There is also another element that makes 8BitMMO a little more entertaining; the ability to build. You are able to build a houses and environments like a top down Minecraft or Terraria. The building can become tedious with blocks stacking not the way you want them to and having a lack of tools to do anything truly spectacular. Although I didnt enjoy this feature, I did see many interesting and cool user created homes and even areas that put the building and combat to good use. The music is probably what I enjoyed most from 8BitMMO, it had beats that went along with the art direction and it had the convenient feature to skip the current song as if i was using Pandora radio. The game does have a leveling system like most other MMO's that encourage you to rank up in order to get certain items or get to certain areas. I have to completely honest and say that I didnt have a great time with 8BitMMO. It is free on Steam and does offer microtransactions, BUT doesnt flash them around begging for money. The game might be fun with a few friends looking to make your own quests and adventures but playing alone is just plain boring.  Overall:  8BitMMO has a lot of great ideas that just dont work out yet. After sometime and update the game can be great. The music fits in with the world perfectly and the combat is a little bland. In my opinion I would like to see RobbyZ create either more content for this game or make more games with the same amount of snark and wit that the tutorial of this game had. I loved the original dialogue and was set to play a game that knew how to make fun of its self but instead, I got a bland and lifeless world that could and should be improved dramatically. And could be alot of fun if your bored with nothing new to play or if you find a group to play with.(Roleplaying could be fun in this game)",

I haven't played much, but only because you guys are obviously not finished with it, but right now it looks like it has a lot of potential. There are a few bugs in there, like a shadow bug after taking away bricks (don't know if it's just me), but it looks like it's gonna be good. I really like where you guys are going. With that being said, I do have a few rants about it.  -The open world is all brown. I don't know if it's unaccesable (again, haven't played much), but it just looks kinda ugly on the world map site. I do not mean to offend.  -restricting access to blocks from low levels is a weird mechanic. If the restricted blocks do something special, then sure, but if it's just decoration it's weird.  there's more, but I am very tired this morning so I will stop here.",

            "review_text": "I'd rather post a sideways thumb, but, as there ain't one, I'll give this a thumbs up, due to its creativity.  I know my play time in 8bitMMO is pretty low, but thats just it. This game is so simple. Its pixelated, so feels more like a computer game from 1993-2000. Literally. I felt like I'd fallen into a timewarp or something, when I first tried this. It should be noted that, messages from the community disappear after a few seconds, to minutes(depending on how many are chatting) so it is hard to tell how the community is, or how active it is, to me.  Ai is the evil, really terrible....Lawyer Cats. Yea. That appears to be the basic enemy, and may be the only one on the game. Unless the quest sends you to kill a certain thing, such as slugs. And fighting is simple enough. Press the Spacebar. One Lawyer Cat down. Even if you got 4-5 Cats running after you. Oh and as of level 2, my total HP(Hit Points) is the very super high number of 6.  You can also build in 'towns' across the game. The owner is known as the Mayor, and with his permission, you can build in it, and become a citizen of that town. Then you place blocks down, similarly to MineCraft. Except the game has 'flat walls' which is where the game world is flat, and you run along in, what looks like a maze of colored pixels. Just like back in the ancient days of gaming.  Overall, this is probably the best MMO for children, or complete newcomers to the genre. Simple, and teaches you the basics of MMO gaming. It also lacks alot of that challenging, wanting to come back for more. Veteran MMO players will probably find this game super boring, while young kids, new MMO comers, or fans of pixelated Indie games may feel like they found a treasure trove with this game. Again, only reason I put a thumbs up was cause, 1. No neutral thumb and 2. Its creativity and uniquness of making it look so pixelated seems 1-of-a-kind.",

Add Steam workshop ... i mean , 3 swords.... so players would make 1000+ more swords you know why? its a pixelated game so its easy to design a sword in this game. I dont know if this was added but add so you can create your own server! So many ideas , do so you can craft things! do so you can break the defeault land in your world , do animals that dont atack so you can hunt , take them and give them to that zombie from the start for money! Do more furniture! do so you can buy a HOUSE , not separated blocks! Do it Open World! do it so you can craft new clothes! Okay that was all my ideas... for now.",

It used to be a good game. It used to be one of the best MMOs on PC, or at least had the potential to be... But now it's completely and utterly ruined by the terrible community and anti-art moderators. Initially the lack of content was okay, after all it was Early Access. But this lack of content hasn't been fixed. In other words - there's nothing to do. Sure it's an MMO, but there's NOTHING TO DO. Came back after months of not playing and within minutes completely changed by mind. Thank God it's free. I honestly don't recommend it unless you're incredibly short on money. Even the original 8 bit idea doesn't hold up as isn't a true 8 bit.  I had to change my recommendation, as I couldn't have it as positive anymore on good conscious. Sorry; I can't recommend this game anymore.  It's somehow gotten worse through development...",

PAY SOME MONEY (if you don't want to be starving to death killing dumb as ♥♥♥♥ characters), Want a telepad? PAY MORE MONEY! Want a useless transformation? PAY MONEY! Want to get useless shirts? PAY MONEY, this game is about pure P2W, everything you want need to farm alot of enemys in dungeons and stuff,  now... Overrall? 2.3125/10 (calculator numbers) Good concept, bad way to do it, This game happened the same as superman 64, it was going to be extreme, but the manageres didn't wanted to do a sandbox game (like GTA games or Saints rows) and did that loopy ♥♥♥♥",

Note that I have nothing against games with 8bit or 16bit art styles, as I actually own several true 8 and 16 bit games.  1. Your character has two sprites, one as an idle sprite, one for walking. This means you will never know which way you are facing. 2. These graphics just seem lazy. The charm of 8bit is taking that limitation and making something beautiful out of it, not going HELLO LOOK AT ME IM SUCH A NOSTALGIA JUNKIE LOOK ITS 8BIT SEE SEE. That doesn't stop your game from looking like crap. Take an example of another game that uses an 8bit artstyle, the ever popular Shovel Knight. The difference between these two games is that one looks good, and actually has different sprites for which direction your character is facing, as well as the simple fact that it actually looks like a game from the time period it's trying to emulate. 3. Whenever you walk against walls, everything kind of jerks around and I have no idea why. 4. The music is like someone took a generic dubstep loop and gutted it of anything that might have made it good. 5. The game tries to be cool by breaking the fourth wall in really dumb ways. 6. User created dungeons are rarely a good idea. 7. Don't even bother walking under any sort of ceiling. The effect is not pleasant. 8. The first mandatory dungeon is a LOLcats reference. 9. There is no point to any NPC humor whatsoever. This lead to me skipping so much of their dialogue. 10. Stepping up onto another block makes the camera jerk around.   Don't support these developers, and don't play this game.",

A atleast descent pixel MMO would be realm of the mad god but even that is repetative and boring. I honestly just didnt like this game as it is. I give this game the AMERICAN ratting of 4/10. I probably would not recommend this game.",

The fact that you can't turn the camera sucks. Well, if you check the game news, they have a beta for a 3D game, but that's kinda early acess there for 15 $ waiting to be on the game. It's confusing if your going to build.  Also, don't listen to the fact that it's massively multiplayer. Once, 2 others were playing. Only 2 others.  Good rpg, just needs potential. It will be better once it gets a little better.  This game has potential. It has lots of potential, just needs a good update to make it better.",

Even though the game shows promise with being able to build whatever you want and start your own towns and the like...i was not hooked with this like i was with Minecraft or other games that do this type of formula. The quests are all very generic, such as only incremeting the amount of blocks you need to face or enemies you need to kill. Blocks need to be purchased, and even though thats not bad, good luck trying to find to a place to build instead of your own personal portal since most towns either have buildings that are fully complete or were eventually left alone. Money, which is need to pay for blocks, is also slow to obtain; bad lag is also apparent some time.  In the end, this game showed promise early on, but eventually fell to some problems which did not contribute to the overall experience. Mabye in a year or two my opinion will be different, but spending 10 or 20 dollars on founders packs is money that could be used on other games which could provide more and last longer.",
