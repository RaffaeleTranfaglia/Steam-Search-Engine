The village of our hero was robbed so he will try to get back all the resources what required for the survival of the village as winter is coming. Of course, the story dont stop there, our hero find more conspiracy behind that robbery.  This game is not long, could be finished on hard difficulty in 4hours. This game dont gets anything new to the gaming industry, not a revolutinary game. BUT...  I bought it on sale, so was only 1eur+few cents. definetly worth that price, 1/10 value of a movie ticket and twice as long entertainment.  i like to get achievements while playing and this game have some. additionaly, developers of this game are not ♥♥♥♥♥♥, they added achievements what you will get on your playthrough not like in other 4hours games where they add not understandable achievements like play game for 100hours or kill 50k enemies while you will get like 1-2k in one playthrough.  Game is very entertaining. These kind of games could be repetative after a few hours but in this case the game ends before you could have that feeling and while you progressing toward the end there will be something new in each battle: New enemies, new abilites, new troops.  achievements difficulty: 1/10 price-value ratio: 9/10",

            "review_text": "Braveland is a fun little strategy RPG where you play a guy who's village was destroyed and he's out for revenge. You have a overhead map you move around on going from point to point. Each point either has an enemy, friendly, store, or treasure.  You can buy and find or buy gear to increase your attacks, and defenses. You will also earn specials that can be released after being hit so many times. Each special costs a different amount and can be pretty helpful at times. As you progress through the map you will come across friendlies who will join up with you. You'll get help from knights, archers, and healers for example.  When building a team for battles they give you a point system. Each unit stack costs a certain amount and your max points to use is 15. So for example farmers costs 2 points per stack and archers are 3. Then after leveling up your main character you will be allowed to recruit more people per unit stack. This way when you go into battle you would have like 15 farmers per stack, 10 archers per stack, and so on. Enemies may only take some damage or may wipe out a few people from the stack. After each battle you are given exp points and gold. Then if you lost people you get charged a certain amount to revive them.   I played the game on easy considering I have a ton of games to play and really want to clear out some backllog. It has a cool little story and was fun to play. I finished it in about 5 hours. Braveland is definitely worth playing.",

            "review_text": "Braveland is a simple, lightweight turn based strategy in the vein of Shining Force and Final Fantasy Tactics. You play the role of the Commander of a small and motley crew of fighters seeking vengeance against an evil army that sacked your village.   The player starts with a pitchfork-weilding peasant and an archer, and eventuall unlocks 3 more melee fighters, one more archer, and a healer. The healer is also able to cast magic bolts at enemies at any range. The player's character doesn't appear in the battle directly but is able to cast attack and status effect spells during battle. The tactics are generally pretty simple. The largest force a player may bring into combat is 5 members but because there is cap on the sum of ranks of player units, the later, there is a choice as to whether to bring a lot of fast/low armor units or a smaller number of slow/heavily armored units. Despite its apparent simplicity, there is just enough depth to keep the game interesting through its campaign. The campaign isn't terribly long, with a full playthrough on Normal difficulty taking about 4 hours. Muc longer than this, and there would need to be more depth to keep the game interesting.   The graphics are pleasant, with a hand-drawn motif thant is a bit more sophisticated than the retro-throwback style so many games employ these days. The colors are bright, animations are smooth, and it is generally fairly clear what to expect from new units -- both friend and foe -- when you first enounter them. The music is well produced and fits the game's art style to a T, with a somewhat medieval/fantasy feel and a nice mellow overworld theme and battle music that conveys tension but keeps with the smooth and relaxing feel of the rest of the game.   Bottom Line: That 'smooth and relaxing' feel is this game's draw. It is not a super deep prove-your-mettle-as-a-general battle/war sim. It's deep enough to be a little engaging but not so involved as to be distressing. It is a diversion for a few minutes or hours getting away from the hectic and stressful beat of real life or a soothing distraction to pass the time on a bus or in a waiting room where your undivided focus for several hours simply isn't available.",

If a person wants a HOMM or Kings Bounty type game, this isn't it, way to short. I'd say under $5 - $10 (for all 3) Max just to help devs make something with more content.",

If you really wanted to, you could play through this game in a single sitting, though this would be a feat in of itself considering how tedious the gameplay would become. No one should ever play this game on the easiest difficulty (not even your kids).  Despite all of the negatives I have for this game, the gameplay is a bit different and can be fun in small quantities. If you can get this game cheap enough, it would be worth playing.

Braveland is a strategy game where you lead a band of fighters on a quest to stop the person that wrecked your village. Battles take place on a hexagonal grid where a single cell can contain any number of units of a specific class. So if you have an active party of 76 farmers and 24 archers you'll see 2 units on the field. One for the farmers, one for the archers. Units take turns based on their speed stat and will move up to and/or attack the enemy. This all sounds quite nice, and tactical turn based combat was what drew me to this game in the first place. However, the game is very limited in scope.  There are ~12 classes in the game, of which ~6 are recruitable. They're almost all human, and rather lacklustre. It doesn't help that the art style makes everybody look bland and uninterested/uninteresting, truly like Playmobil figurines. Progression happens on a world map, where each node is an event or a battle, and these progress roughly linearly (there are short branches that lead to minor upgrades every now and then). Battles can not be replayed.  All in all the whole game seems to lack passion. None of what it presented managed to surprise or engage me. The plot went nowhere, the upgrades, spells and allies you gain don't really change the basic formula in any way. There's nothing  wrong  with the game, but I don't think you should play it.",

Turn based combat, with magic on a small / medium grid map.   The game's art is good and overall productions values are correct. The execution of the game overall is good.   What's the problem with the game then?.   Well if you simplify the formula, limiting units,magic and RPG elements to the  minimum extent, you need a lot of content to keep the user playing the game.   On a tablet / mobile environment, the game has more sense than in the PC scenario,even for a casual strategy game (the lack of content is just absurd).
