            "review_text": "Despite my only having a few minutes logged in the Steam version, I have been using this software since the US version released a little over two years ago. I have a long-running comic (kawaiikochan dot com) and I've even put out a book with this software (this took a little more than just Comipo). I have a LOT of experience with it.  I'm writing this review because I want you to understand what you're going to get from Comipo before you decide to buy it, without any hyperbole or sugar-coating.  Comipo is a toy construction set clearly intended to make light-weight comedies in a school setting, preferably with female characters. Every model, every asset, and even the poses lean in this direction. Character customization is limited to eyes and hair, and this sameness will become apparent if you have a lot of characters.  If you need more than that, another genre or another character type, you're going to come up against the walls of this program pretty much immediately and I can't recommend you buy it. If you want to make an action comic, nope nope nope.  That being said it's perfectly fine for my purpose, which is to make weird 4-panel comics in which moe girls talk about nothing important. I've gotten more than my money's worth, personally.  I had zero trouble learning the software. The interface is super simple, just drag and drop. Making it actually look good isn't much harder (the main point is not to stretch the character box until it's huge or you'll have an ugly, jaggy model). There are little, basic tweaks like coloring and filters that go a long way with some creative fiddling. I don't use outside assets or programs because I don't really feel the need. If you don't want to use them, you don't have to either.  The program accomplishes its goal on a basic level-- if you can't draw, yes, you can make anime-looking comics with this-- but it's in serious need of expansion and improvement as far as assets go. This version is a year behind the Japanese one, so hopefully the gap will be filled a little bit when the program is updated.  For pre-Steam owners of Comipo: I got a key from the publisher by asking on their support page. The software is identical. It installs separately from your existing copy and it'll have your saved materials, but not the DLC. So it isn't much use. I just wanted to write a review.",

All four clothes are school uniform so your comic has to be about students. 6 different colours to chose from. No skin tints. All backgrounds are super Japanese, so if you want to have a comic that is set anywhere else, forget about it. It may be worth getting when there are some DLC's but until then DO NOT. Even then it'll cost to buy this then pay extra for DLC's to maybe make it worth getting. I ignored the reviews. Don't make my mistake.",

            "review_text": "Despite what some negative reviews have said, it actually is possible to have two characters overlap each other, it just takes a bit of figuring out: specifically, you have to use the barriers of the boxes to 'cut off' the body part you want to appear over the other character, then use copy and paste and move the character to the exact other side of the box so that only the arm, leg, head whatever is visible, and line it up with the rest of the body. That's the real tricky part: lining up the figures so that (for example) an arm is where it should be requires so much precision that it's basically trial and error. Extremely difficult, but (theoretically) possible.  Having said that, I would highly recommend ONLY buying this program on SALE. I managed to get the program and three DLC for roughly 20 dollars total, and I still feel like I overpaid. But I suppose that's all the more reason to make the most of it.",

            "review_text": "Comipo is a program you're either going to get a lot of use out or nothing at all, depending on what you think you're going to get out of it. Since the reviews for this program are all over the place, I thought I'd honestly write about what you can and can't do with it so you can realistically decide if it's any use to you or not.  At its very core, Comipo is a very simplified drag and drop comic creator, letting you place 3D models of characters into various situations. The interface is actually very easy to learn, and every object is loaded into a separate layer in each panel like Photoshop or something. If you've ever used the Mac application Comic Life, it's a very similar experience, as you can pretty quickly make a simple comic using only your mouse (save for a keyboard for writing in text balloons).  The main problems most people have with the program are mostly focused on the limited resources Comipo offers. By default, Comipo only has 4 characters you can use in the comics (1 male and 1 female character in two different outfits each). While you can change a fair amount of features on each character (changing the outfit design, hair, coloring, etc) and save them for later, you're definitely going to have a hard time differentiating from everybody if you plan on using multiple characters in a comic, mostly because everybody is based on the same character builds. Comipo does have the ability to import 2D images and 3d models, and while most images import without any issue, I never managed to make 3d models import correctly, as they used a very specific filetype and usually come out incomplete anyways.  The limitations also spread to what the characters themselves can do as well, as while most characters have a pretty good selection of poses (with the ability to tweak the hands and head slightly with each one), odds are pretty good you'll have to make compromises in your comics. A lot of the poses are really focused on a school and general conversation settings with only a few 'action' poses, so the chance of you making any sort of fight scene is near-impossible.  So what is Comipo actually good for with its limitations? Well, if you just want to make a silly comic where some characters talk or argue and maybe publish it for fun on your blog or twitter, this is honestly a fun and simple program to use and you really can't go wrong with it (you can also export at absurdly high resolutions, eg bigger than 5k per panel). If you want to make any sort of serious comic, you really shouldn't bother, because the whole comic will feel artificial with the built-in assets and the limitations in the program will probably frustrate you.  If you're still not sure about Comipo, they placed a demo on their website you can try for yourself. It's not listed on Steam, and I can't link it here because Steam gets mad at you for putting links in reviews, so just google 'comipo demo'",

            "review_text": "Tremendous contention has emerged regarding the limitations of Comipo software. My focus for this review is what you CAN do with it. Originally, I bought the non-steam version of this software from Comradz, and the support staff was kind enough to provide me with a complimentary steam key. The best way to describe Manga Maker Comipo is this: 'An effective means to create a comic without drawing.' I have used Comipo daily for a week now (and posting my webcomics created solely with Comipo at boredwebcomic DOT tumblr DOT com), and every day I learn something new. I hate to read instruction manuals, and prefer to learn by exploring. The basic package comes w/ 2 gals, 1 boy, and an adult of each gender. Additionally the software provides a number of poses in 3D (that cannot be changed via the Comipo software), along with a variety of facial expressions.   To some extent, your ability to create comics are limited if you are forced to stick with this basic package. However, Comipo gives you the ability to import objects and images, and that to me is an understated aspect of this software. Since the software was launched a bit earlier in Japan, the Japanese community has created a ton of freely available backgrounds, characters, and objects. And it is important for you, the purchaser of the English version of Comipo, to explore what's available online.   In addition, the click and drag interface for choosing elements to utilize for your comic is a really efficient method of creating your own comic. Instead of drawing everything by hand and spend hours at it, I have been able to create four panel comics and spend less than an hour each session. Something doesn't look right? The angle is wrong? The elements in the panel don't mesh? The software allows you to make easy adjustments, or even a quick do over by erasing a single element while retaining the rest of the panel. If you have ever drawn a comic by hand, you know exactly what a difference maker that is, to be able to erase a particular item in the comic panel.   Furthermore, the Comipo software incorporates the elements in a panel on a layer basis. That means you can easily shift the order of the layers in a particular panel. For example, if you decide to emphasize a sound effect, you could have that layer at the bottom of the order in the panel, so that it is entirely visible to the reader. But let's say you change your mind and want to deemphasize the sound effect, but still retain this element in the panel. You simply drag the sound effect layer to the top of the order and this allows the effect to stay in the panel. However, the layer could then be hidden from view by an overlapping text bubble or another element.   The ability to click and drag any element in Comipo provides the comic artist with total control over how each panel will appear in the comic. Along with the ability to import images and objects, Manga Maker Comipo is a time saving tool to create comics both online and offline.",

Not too keen on the idea of purchasing DLC, but looked around and there are tonnes of tutorials for importing custom objects, hair, accessories etc.  So while simple to use, has a rather large learning curve to do anything spectacular, I recomend this for anyone with a lot of patience and isn't very artistic (like myself).",

Why can't you create your own poses? *There isn't 3d backgrounds, and there aren't many backgrounds that I like. Half of the time I'm using the backgrounds from the glittery, anger and shock, and ect. backgrounds for outdoor and indoor scenes. *Comipo is way to overpriced for what you get  Positive things: *The models do come out very good in comic strips. *The poses come out okay. *The faces look great on the characters.  I just want to make a manga that people can like and see the details and work I put into it. Not make a manga that people look at and go,'Where are they?','Whats Happening?', 'OKAY WHERE IS THE FAN SERVICE!!??'.

This is not for people who think there are billions of things to do without putting work into it. they have Import ablity that allows you to make things from other programs like photoshop and 2d/3d programs and put them into this software and you can from there take and make comics.  You can, if you don't know how, make comics with what they give you. They also have DLC packs and things you can buy and install to give you more items/chrs/backgrounds if you DO NOT know how to make these things, but you may not enjoy it fully if you do not know how to create things to add to the program on your own.  This is not easy to do and use without practice, I know the video and the way the software makes it sound its super simple. You want a basic understanding on how to layer objects and place items in frames. Things like putting more then one item down at a time and moving them so they fit. GREAT SOFTWARE but takes PRACTICE. Do not get if your gonna do a side hobbie and not put effort into this side hobbie.  If you do put time and effort into this program and have the ablity to make things on your own, you will and can be very happy with this software, I know I am. But this program is not for everyone.
