You are running a restaurant, but the complexity of it severely outstrips your regular diner dash style game. Almost every food has multiple recipes (there are something like 35 different hamburger combinations possible), and your menu has upwards of 20 items, of which you can serve 4-6 on any given day. Manage service, janitorial requirements and a variety of other tasks. It's hard to describe how complex and yet how engaging this game is. It is seriously stressful, especially on the later levels, but pulling off 88 orders in a row perfectly is a rush; this is really an underrated and great game.",

            "review_text": "Cook, Serve, Delicious! is a restaurant/cooking simulator where you start with a rundown little cafe and turn it into a five star restaurant all the while cooking numerous dishes, fending off robbers and flushing blocked toilets. While the game might not sound like everyone's cup of tea it combines addictive gameplay with a good progression system to make a fun gaming experience. As a huge fan of the Papa's Pizzeria games this was a must buy for me and I was not disappointed.  +Nice simplistic graphics, food and drink is well designed and the UI is nice to look at as well +Incredibly addictive, simple gameplay that keeps you coming back for more +You can take place in bets each day which require you to get a certain combo with certain foods +You are rewarded for perfect orders and penalised for bad orders which helps push you to try as hard as you can +Lots of different dishes including drinks +Most dishes have upgrades which adds a new ingredient and new recipe cards +All recipe cards have specific names +Local co-op game mode +The hotkeys for the different ingredients are for the most part intuitive, i.e. the first letter of the ingredient is the hotkey, and if you don't like them the hotkeys can be edited +Full controller support for both the Xbox 360 Controller and the Dualshock 4 Controller +Great music +There are special events in the game which you can take part in such as catering events which earn you more money  -The frequency of work orders (flushing the toilet, cleaning the dishes, taking out the trash and setting rat traps) seemed a bit too high, in particular the flushing the toilet job seemed to be very frequent even when the toilet had been upgraded -The progression on the star system is very slow and food upgrades are very expensive -Once you start unlocking more order slots (you start with four and then it increases) it becomes increasingly difficult to keep track of all of the orders you have on the go and I often pressed the wrong key and sent out an order early, breaking a combo -I had a couple of issues where I lost saves and had to replay about 2 hours worth -You can't upgrade the appearance of your restaurant apart from the automatic changes when you get a new star   Verdict: 7  A great restaurant/cooking sim that is perfect for fans of similar games but might be quite boring for most, best to pick this up on sale.

It’s mostly on the food minigames that is the core gameplay, no prep, tweaking food prices, supply and demand.    The beginning is very slow when not during rush hour everyday. Later in the game when at 3 star your restaurant you will have very little downtime. It’s stressful and challenging but really fun.    I do hate that can’t start the order over if you made a mistake and can force you lose the perfect day bonus, which early on a lot compared to your daily income, later on in the game, it’s not really needed    I wish you the stats gave me more info like how many days I had an item on the menu, tips per food to try and maximize my profits bro    Cooking is a button mashing mechanic with each item being something different; chores are the same way (love the robbery minigame, sarcasm of course)    You can bet money to see how many perfect orders you can get in a row, everyday its randomized what items are needed on the menu    I played this using a controller, it just seems easier but mistakes can be made when using the analog sticks. ( I did try using the mouse and the arrow keys only, it's doable, but damn it's a clickfest. I don't know how keyboard is even plausible)    This game is very repetitive; your goal is to get to a 5 star restaurant. A checklist of requirements needs to be met to go up a star    They require 20 days minimum as the annoying requirement. This requirement will be the last one done and wish this wasn't a requirement. It would make the game shorter, more enjoyable, and less grindy    There are catering and iron chef style events that offer different challenges, but are few and don't happen till level 2 and 3 restaurants. Each level of star takes about 3-4 hours.    You are rewarded if you have a perfect day, sadly if you make a mistake in an order you can’t restart the order and have to take the penalty. You can just restart the day over if it was at the beginning, otherwise I would just take the hit and not get bonus( because money was never really an issue)   It might sound like the game is bad, it’s not, it’s just not great either. I wanted it to be more of a management cooking game( plus I played this after playing Overcooked which is amazing)     My Score:",

Pros:  1. Lots of food  2. Lots of upgrades for your food  3. Hard, Fast &amp; Rewarding  4. Good Art  5. Very Addictive  7. Extra Events a.k.a Challenges that can reward you extra cash but some challenges are way harder to do  8. Random E-mails (Some of them are funny)  9. Good Tutorials  10. You Can Date Other People Who Love Cooking (Not Actual People Just In The Game)  11. Good Music  Cons:  1. I thought the lack of multitasking was an issue for me like for example I'm cooking a burger but I notice some of my other food or chores is going to disappear if I don't interact with it so I try to click on the disappearing object while I'm cooking the burger but nothing happens (Well The only Time I'm able to click on a disappearing object while I'm cooking is if the food is ready to serve), I thought there would be multitasking with the food &amp; chores but I guess not...  2. Every time you do a correct dish for the person your dating they always take up most of your time texting which leaves a lot of angry customers because I'm busy using my cellphone instead of making food (Again this is an issue with no multitasking)  Overall This game always makes me hungry &amp; I highly recommend buying this Yummy Game.",

Gameplay (9/10)  This is where the game shines most, getting various interesting food orders from customers that can really test your eye, hand and brain coordination to make sure you don't screw it up and get as many perfect points as you can, managing your menu, buying equipments and upgrading your food quality, random events that can influence the number of customers coming to your restaurant, there's definitely a lot of elements that comes into play. Simple, yet fast packed action.   Graphics (9/10)  Cartoonish graphics is nice here with also nice looking food and it's also nice to see yourself plopping on ingredients onto your own made food ordered by your customers.   Sound/Music (8/10)  Sound wise it's rather simple, nothing mind blowing here but it gets the job done right here. Music wise it is catchy, nice and during certains parts of the game it gets better. The only problem with this is that it can get repetitive but still it suits the game's atmosphere just fine.  Controls (10/10)  The controls are quite simple, fully utilizing the keyboard functions when preparing your customer's food and the best part is you get to customize and configure the settings to your own liking and corresponds to the keys to certaing ingredients (Example: Cheese - C)   Overall (9/10)  Fast, simple and interesting game which has a lot more depth than Diner Dash.

            "review_text": "Thinking about Cook, Serve, Delicious, I wish there was a third option in terms of my recommendation: a sideways thumb. Before I begin, I would like to admit I have a fake food fetish. Wooden toy sushi rolls, plastic hamburgers that can be assembled, lego food. It all stirs my imagination and I often find lingering over these items when I encounter them if out holiday shopping for nieces and nephews. So the premise, setting and aesthetics of most any cooking sim definitely attracts me.  Now on to this game itself:  I've seen CSD described as a 'hardcore cooking/restaurant' sim. It's not though.  The game boils down to an ellaborate typing and algorithm test. The restaurant and cooking simulation gets a bit weird when soup reveals itself to be one of the most complex dishes to prepare in the game, as you are tasked with prepping each order for soup from scratch.  One missed keystroke not only spoils a dish but you are forced to serve the meal to the customer even though you've cuaght the error. There is no option to 'start over' at a hit for time and or money spent on wasted food.  In my mind, a real 1st person hardcore restaurant sim would challenge you to manage time, like choosing to prep veg and make a new pot of soup prior to lunch rushes. To anticipate and use down time strategically between meals. You might even get a sous chef or kitchen hand who can help chop carrots, etc. or maybe you need to send them to the nearest market because your kitchen just ran out of cream or butter (as sometimes happens in the real world!).  It's not that I want a restaurant sim that is as so close to reality that it would fit in with titles such as 'Farming Simulator 2015.' I think an ideal title in this genre could still have the same pace of gameplay that this first iteration of Cook Serve Delicious has, but I would like to see a little more nuance in the structure of the day and the gameplay throughout the day other than a speed challenge to mash buttons with no planning or strategy. For gods' sake, at least make a pot of soup serve 6-10 customers!  Short of it, I think the cooking game genre still has a ways to go. There is room out there for a true 'hardcore cooking &amp; restauarant sim.' But despite it's charms, CSD is not that title for me.  (That being said, I've become something of an achievement hound as of late and I will likely continue to play the game, at least till I hit around 50% completion.)",

            "review_text": "I'd heard people raving about this game for a little while, but put off getting it because I didn't understand how a restaurant management sim could be so good. I've never been so wrong. Cook, Serve, Delicious is one of the most addictive games I've played in a long time. Every once in a long while a game comes along that just executes every single thing it set out to do, and executes those things perfectly. This is one of those games.  It's a deep game, mechanically speaking. You have access to a large number of different foods, restaurant equipment, and upgrades that can make it easier to manage your customers, prepare your food, or earn the almighty dollar (which in turn lets you buy and upgrade more food, natch). But despite this, the game has one of the softest learning curves I've ever seen, gently letting you flourish from a struggling corn dog cart jockey to a masterful soux chef and maybe even find some love along the way.  The biggest key to the success of CSD has to be it's intuitive nature. Not since Wii Sports have I played a game that has such natural feeling controls. After a few minor stumbles along the way (v for olives, n for onions) I find myself juggling prep stations with ease, pounding out orders quickly, glancing at the minimum info I need and making sure I'm not feeding anyone raw fish, unless they want it.  Finally, the art and sound really seal the deal. The background music keeps things hopping and peaks and ebbs when it needs to, and the distinctive sounds for various events keep you focused on what's important. The perfect 'whoof' that I heard the first time I set something on fire was particularly memorable, but the separate dings for dishes that are ready vs. prepped are essential.  In short, this is a fantastically well put together game that has given me more hours of enjoyment than several 'AAA' titles (that cost me far more, to boot) and I can think of exactly zero reasons that would make me hesitate to recommend this game to anyone. Unless of course you're some kind of fun-hating grump.",

You are in charge of single-handed running the busiest restaurant in the world, and are expected to prepare and serve each meal promptly and to order. This is simple with cheaper dishes such as corn dogs and fish filet; however, as the game progresses, and you are asked to prepare more complicated meals, the pace mounts exponentially. Balancing your menu not only involved making sure you don't serve the same thing too often: it also involves balancing your menu so that you don't serve too many difficult dishes at once. For those not satisfied with the normal progression, random bets and Steam challenges are here to give you the opportunity to grab extra bragging rights.  Honestly, CSD is one of the best cooking games I've played, and it's definitely worth the full $10.",

The game itself borrows heavily from the PS1 game 'Ore No Ryouri' in that it is essentially a simulator of running a restaurant entirely by yourself. No waitstaff, no chef, just you, a kitchen, and a counter full of customers. The game itself is played entirely with the keyboard, selecting first the customer/ticket you wish to service, then hitting the correct keys to process the order correctly.  The controls do get a little frustrating at times, but it appears that Mr. Chubigans has added a key binding menu for each dish, so any you have particular trouble with can now be changed. Also, the graphics are impeccably watercolor style, and the music/sound design make this game far more relaxing than you would expect from the time-management genre.

But it would get old pretty quick after a while. It's pretty mundane in the sense that it is, basically, the same thing over and over again. You'll get orders, make them, serve them. But if you just want something to play every now and then, I think it's perfect for that. There's not much else you can really do; you can upgrade your restuarant with adding new items and equipement (Like Fryers, Stoves, etc). Bring in new dishes to the menu and upgrade certain dishes as well. But they are quite limited, however with that said, overall it's a pretty fun game, and if you're interested I would check out some gameplay videos on youtube, it's worth a look and personally, I love just taking a couple minutes here and kick back and have some fun.",

I guess 'videogame 'journalists'' will get all tl;dr about p.much anything.  How the game actually goes: Press key to take order. Press keys to make order. Press key to serve order. Sometimes you have to take out the trash or wash dishes or flush a toilet, and you do these things by pressing keys. Rinse. Repeat. After a day is over you can buy new dishes (click dish, click purchase), buy new equipment (the only reason you'll do this is to unlock different dishes or automate some of the trash-taking dish-washing toilet-flushing), or add things to make people wait longer before exiting in a huff. You buy new equipment by clicking on it, btw. Oh but wait, that's not all, you can also plan your menus! (by clicking the foods you've bought)  The 'menu-planning' is kinda simplistic (some dishes get 'old' after two consecutive days, that's really the only thing preventing you from keeping a static min-maxed menu of the Highest Priced Items), and the 'upgrades' are only necessary from an achievement-farming / restaurant star rating upgrade perspective, generally you have to serve 200-300 of a dish before you even recoup the initial investment. To put that in perspective, each day you can expect to sell a maximum of about 50 total dishes across all types.  It's a fun distraction and the execution is great for what it is (you can even rebind the QTE keys - major props for that) but on the other hand the 'upgrade your restaurant' progression requires twenty game-days and after eight game-days it was getting a little tedious so whatever. If Indie, Casual is your thing then by all means check this out, but this isn't a fu­ckin 'Simulation' by any stretch of the imagination and the 'Strategy' is simplistic at best.  If it was categorized properly (Indie, Casual) I'd give it a thumbs-up, but the miscategorization/misrepresentation is pretty sleazy. If this is a strategy simulation then TF2 is a wargame.",

You get to select the menu each day and work your way up from a one star to platinum five-star restaurant by meeting certain targets. You can buy and upgrade the foods you put on the menu and as your restaurant progresses more of the luxury foods become available and some of the basic foods become unavailable. For example you can't buy lobster in a one-star restaurant, and sadly can't serve a corndog in a five-star restaurant. You prepare the foods through one or more phases of keystrokes modified by the specific orders desired by the customers. in multiple phase recipes there are interstitial periods of cooking for a certain amount of time, if you exceed the amount of time for cooking a food you may burn it or it may go bad from being held too long. Additional time restrictions come from the customers only waiting a certain amount of time for you to start their order; and the need to take care of chores such as doing the dishes, taking out the trash, and setting mouse traps. In it's essence it's a typing game, with a lot of short term time management. If you don't touch type you'll probably have a tough time in the later game. When you are getting through a lunch rush and moving from order to order though, it ends up feeling more like a rhythm game. I found it highly engaging and to perform well you have to focus very intently in much the same way needed in playing a bullet hell shoot-em up. The game has recently added multi-player functionality and online leader-board challenges, but having only played the single player campaign I can't speak to how good those features are. When I saw this game initially I thought it fun, but it ended up being way more entertaining and engrossing than I expected. I'd give it a 9/10 and a definite recommendation.",

(The game is still good, just was an old Game Maker game)  You need to manage orders/chores by performing a microgame of sorts to cook the food and each one has a time limit before the customer gets fed up and leaves. Very fast paced and somewhat difficult as it relies on quickly figuring out what to do (as orders change from customer to customer) and then using the right ingredients.  Only problems I have is that I felt like it is overcomplicating a game that is meant to be simple by adding variables to what food you can serve depending on variables such as if it's a fatty food, creates a lot of dishes etc. The first game was quite simple in this regard. Also removed the morning paper from each day which was pretty funny to read in the first game.  As you need to make very quick decisions and know the hotkeys to place the ingredients, it's very important that the game can properly convey this at a glance. Unfortunately it does this a bit worse than the original game but it should be fine if you spend awhile to adjust.  Overall a good game to play for awhile. Works best on keyboard due to keys matching the first letter of each ingredient.    It's good.",

As you perform an action in the game, whether it is changing the size of your fountain drink cup or throwing meat onto the hot grill, there is a pleasurable sound that follows. The game appears pretty simple, but actually has some depth. Each food has certain positives and negatives that you have to take into account when you plan your daily menu. A certain number of foods might be optimal in terms of profitability, and you may be tempted to include only those because you need cash, but I enjoy mastering as many foods as I own as possible. There are various other challenges, such as catering, which may require you to serve certain foods you might not be used to. Catering is a good idea, because you can make more money faster than you can in your restaurant.   Each type of food also carries certain chores with it, which you also must do to maintain your perfect combos. The health inspector shows up every once in awhile to make sure you are doing all your chores. There is equipment that allows you to expand the foods you can cook, mitigate negatives from food you're serving, and make your chores easier. Lately I've been more into games like this, where the goals are clear, but you have some freedom in how you achieve those goals.   The main negative of this game is that it is repetitive and fairly demanding in terms of optimal gameplay. It's difficult to play over a long period of time, because you really need to pay attention to what you're doing. During a rush hour, you really have to keep track of which order has come in first &amp; understand which tasks you should tackle first. You need to take cook times, length of chores, and customer patience into account. When I started having trouble with my health inspections, I first invested in an automatic dishwasher to mitigate my dish washing, which was my most time-consuming chore. After trash became the longest &amp; most troublesome, I got the trash service. The game is very addictive, and because it can be demanding, ti is difficult to play for long periods of time.

This is a cooking game, and a management game, but it is quite debateable whether or not it is 'casual', although I am not saying all casual games are bad, as I have played some good ones, but it does seem to not have as many fatures as a casual game, as cooking and casual aren't always the same thing.  The reason I say this isn't a casual game, is because when you think of casual games, you would normally think of a relaxing and easy-to-play game, something where you don't need to think. This game is far from relaxing, it is a great simulation of having a panic attack. There is no easy mode, only normal and extreme, and even normal mode can seem quite impossible. Juggling all these different foods, while at the same time having to do chores, such as flush the toilet, because we all know that's a chef's job.  The gameplay in this is not only intense, but it is also centred around typing. It would be easy if it was simply typing out words, such as what the food/recipe was, but no, you have to prapere the food, and each ingrediant/action is one letter, meaning you will end up muttering to yourself while you type a ridiculous combo of letters and numbers.   PSCR PSCR PSCR  Once you get use to one combonation of letters for a certain meal, you will then, upgrade it as you go, and struggle to learn even more keys. As well as prapering foods for consumtion, you need to amke sure they don't burn, that you don't accidentally press 4 when you meant to press 5 and serve the food undercooked.  There is so much more to be said about this game: the graphics, the music, the humour and references, the progression, the events, etc. But all that needs to be said for it, is that you should buy it and play it, as it is quite worth it's money, and is a very enjoyable game, with a very high replay value.",

It's more Restaurant play - cleaning up, putting together pre-made ingredients, deciding which dishes to buy &amp; which to upgrade, and personalizing per the order. Order Up on the Wii was a magnificent game, and this builds on that idea by making it keyboard-friendly, thus MUCH faster.  Side note - my daughter &amp; her friend streamed this on twitch &amp; loved yelling at the customers. They were able to split between arrow-keys/mouse for one player and 1/2/3/4 &amp; S for the other.. it was a fun vision of teamwork that I found myself missing when I played alone.",

This game is really fun. Fun truly is the best to explain what I felt during it. The sounds of the game truly support the aesthetic of 'Slap the ingredients in the sandwich, you got 50 other things to do!', and the hectic environment it creates supports that. Also, the game challenges you to step out of your comfort zone, which I rarely do. Proof of that is when I had a routine of having beer, salad, ice cream, coffee, and I alternated burgers and pizza (due to menu rot, where people dislike it when certain items stay on the menu for too long.). I was so good at making those that I never failed an order, or got it average. However, the game goes to great lengths to keep itself fresh, in many ways that I cannot describe. Soon enough, I had replaced my entire menu, and having more fun from doing it! I am so happy that Cook, Serve, Delicious was greenlighted!",

It's nothing more than pressing the correct button at the correct time, so that the correct thing hapens.  ...but I have to argue, there's something with how it is presented, something that just lures me to play more and more of this game, it's simple, it's pushing correct buttons at correct timing, but... it is packaged in a way that you won't really get bored while playing it. The rewards are rewarding and somewhat on time. You won't get almost everything in one sitting, you have to gradually adapt, to see, which menus do you like (read: not screw up) the most, which menus needed to be changed daily, which menus do give a positive vibe and thus rack in more customers, etc. It's a nice little sugar on top of the icing to make the game more interactive and press the players to learn newer foods and their preparation.

From the start it was a learning prosesss to manage your costomers, menu, and chores all while having to cook good tasting food, at first i kept having really bad days until i started learning to play smart, choosing items that are easy to make quickly while stillmaking a good amount of money and learning new foods one at a time, once i did that i was hooked on the game, its so much fun to progress your resturant and unlock new foods and equipment to help make things a bit easier on your self, the weekly challenges are great fun as well as the iron cook and catering. The only thing i think should be worked on and i know it wouold kinda take away from the challenage as time gos on is that was a five star resturant you should have at least one employee to do the chores FOR you instead of you handling them all the time like you did as a 1 start place, other then that i love the game and i think anyone who loves cooking games should give it a try, warn you though, might take some getting used to before you start making good food.",
