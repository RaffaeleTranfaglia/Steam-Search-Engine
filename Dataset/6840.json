I just want to play the game at my own pace....2 works A-OK even though it *along with the first two* have problems with being fullscreen, not that it doesn't work its just a bit strange, sometimes vocal briefings do not work but you can still play *Just good luck figuring things out*  WOW...lets stop that train of thought, I was reviewing the third, not the series in terms of performance on Windows 8!  But yeah play Commandos, its expansion, and 2 instead.",

It seems pretty hardcore to learn how to play. Maybe I'll get around to giving it a go, but as of now I'm not very interested in slowly progressing. Though crawling towards dudes while getting blasted has been good for some laughs..",

And the timed missions...they suck, it became a more action focused game :( and the controlls in general do not flow as well as in Commandos 2, makis timed missions a pain, without time to enjoy the enviroment.  Seams that Commandos 2 you failed because you messed up, in 3 it seams they want you to fail completly. Better controlls and better resolution would make this game better.  ",

Most people seem to have like 0.1hrs, I don't really have that much game experience, ON STEAM, with Commandos 2 or 3. But I grew up playing these games, DEFINITELY one of the best strategy and tactical games that will ever exist. I find these games VERY Difficult nowadays, but back in the day when they were the only games I played, I just couldn't stop.  It's only 3.99euros ... Buy these games, except the for the first ones unless you want the complete Commandos experience. Definitely worth your money!!",
