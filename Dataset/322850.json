Feels more like a modded version of previous releases. Except the Pro Mode, everything else is just old. They don't seem to care about going the extra mile and improving the product. The distinctive jersey's are trash. I play the game in 3D mode, and let me tell you, the graphics are very poor. Maybe they should sell the franchise to someone else, a company that knows how to make a proper game. And for the love of God, find a way to provide the proper teams with the proper riders",

            "review_text": "This game is by far the best cycling game in the world. There are two main modes that are commonly played throughout the community (Career, and Pro Cyclist Mode)   Career- The career mode is great if you like to control a whole team. The pros about this mode are it is easy to understand. You can change every aspect about your team and can master the manager part. It is always hard to choose which team you want to choose at the beginning of a career, and this game helps your choices. You can choose between any of the three divisions to select your team (Cya World Tour, Contintental Pro, and Continental) You can filter alphabetically or by the amount of stars they possess (Overall Rating) The cons about this mode are, when selecting a team, they should also give you sponsor details (i.e. Sponsor Budget and Length of contract) Also in this mode there are no major advancements from pcm 2014. Overall this game mode is adicting and very fun. I would recommend this mode to anyone who likes a team and realistic aspect.   Pro Cyclist Mode- This mode is amazing. You can control everything about your rider during the race and out of race (Height, Weight, Complexion, Nationality, you can even change the picture of your rider) The gameplay of this mode is outstanding. There are no downsides to this mode except you should be able to do something with the money you earn. I would reccoment this game to anyone who likes fantasy due to the fake Cyanide Cups at the beginning and the fact that you are not a real pro cyclist.  Overall this game is the best one out there. The gameplay is amazing no matter what mode you play in. It's super addicting and I can't stop thinking about it when I'm not at the controls. This game is for people who truly love the sport of cycling. If you don't know much about the sport, the tutorials will help you further your knowledge about professional cycling. I'll give it a 9.25/10 rating because of the crashes the might happen in the loading screen. Tip: Don't Click ANYTHING during the loading screen of a race.",

            "review_text": "Even though this game crashes a bit, it is still fun to play. The pro cyclist mode is fun, it is actually my favorite mode, but not totally complete because even if you are the team leader, you cannot tell your teamates to get bottles, relay at the front, protect you, or not relay at the front if you are tired (which they sometimes do). The AI in this mode sometimes does not understand that you may be going onto a climb, which makes it easier to bring back a breakaway group. For some, the mode looks bad as you 'cannot' control your rider as you can only tell him to pace and other actions and move from side to side with the number pad. The normal manager mode is fun but if you are only looking at that mode, the only difference between pcm15 and the older games in the series is the ratings, age, and teams of the riders which you can chage with downloading databases off sites like pcm.daily. The track mode is unchanged and is fun to play if you have nothing to do. The one-off race is like last year and is basically unchanged. The game is very fun, but if you do not understand cycling, then the game will feel very strange and awkward.  7.5/10",

I played the 2013 game and after a couple of seasons into the game it feels quite monotone. This gives me the same feeling. All teams and riders still not licensed. Although I must say that I did enjoy the pro cyclist mod, but that also gets very monotone in the lenght.    + Graphic + Pro cyclist mode  - No new features, other than the pro cyclist mode - Not all teams and riders licensed  ",

            "review_text": "Oh, God...  Let's start by saying that sooner or later will have to pass some sort of law that distrust companies like this to bring out products that are not working , are untested and are incomplete...  Several years of new versions, new features and then...  At the current time, the 3D race is... simply unplayable! For many players the 3D race simply fail to start and crash at the loading.  Then, well, one try to use the quick sim feature... and then discovers that the game simply crash MORE than the past versions.  We are talking about 20 total crashes for 4 hours of play, for now.  The new great features and game mode? Nice, but not very polished. You gain money, but you can't do nothing with that; the developing of your player is so fast that you become a sort of Froome in a couple of season; and for the Career mode, the old bugs still persists.  However, the game at least introduce some new pretty design, a new, awaited, game mode, and a some nice improvements.  But, at the end, is still and always the same broken product! It's frankly unacceptable! This company is one of the biggest in Europe, and is still not able to solve bugs (stupid bugs, like stability bugs, not logical bugs!) before releasing his main product.  Finishing, don't buy the game now: you'll finish to asking Steam for a refund. Wait, and check back in the following months, also checking for community mods.",

            "review_text": "This is basically a sports management game and not a cycling game. As far as I can tell I was never able to directly control someone riding a bike. The line which states “Pro Cyclist: a new game mode where you create and control a cyclist from the start of his career and turn him into an international star!“ does not mean you will ride a bike. I gave up on this game early so I won’t say much. So I am writing simply as someone who plays video games.   Pros • Management tools • Decent graphics  • Thorough tutorial • I am confident if you are into managing a cycling team and not into riding you will have a good time.  Cons • You don’t ride a bike • The world is kind of empty for watching cyclist ride around a track • You don’t ride a bike ",
