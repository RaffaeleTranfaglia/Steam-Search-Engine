            "review_text": "  Zephyr, survival.  I join a server just in time for the mad dash for items of value at the start, managing to pick myself up an SA Vz.58 assault rifle with twenty rounds of ammunition.  I look around me, see others with better weapons, and others that could only grab a pipe or knife, consider myself lucky.  'Hey man, can I have that ak?' I turn around, jason bateman points a 22 pistol at my head. His name-tag reads 'darkman'.  'No, you got a gun already.'   'nah man it's a 22- it's ♥♥♥♥.'  'You can't have the ak.'  '♥♥♥♥ you.'  Necessary dialogue is exchanged in the starting area, people form alliances, grudges, allies and enemies. I find myself pairing up with a guy called 'shitler', who picked up a sledgehammer and a few medical items.  We then head down the lower extremeties of the building, going by a staircase until we finally reach the first door. Moans can be heard on the other side, along with the unmistakable slapping of feet on the ground.  'Hey heshy, you go first, you got the ak.' someone says.  I oblige, pushing open the door and entering partly.  It's a medium sized car park area, cars srewn about, left like ghosts of some ancient civilisation, and plenty of zombies too, slower ones, walking around aimlessly, and perhaps three runners at the back.  I focus my attention on the immediate danger, centre the iron sights and take aim on the closest runner, about four metres away, making a beeline straight for me.  I stay trained on it's head, waiting for the right moment, ready to pull the trigger before I hear the door behind me creak shut.  'Shoulda given the ak.' It's darkman, decided to trap me in here in hopes of satisfying some mis-guided want for revenge.  I pull the trigger, or rather hit mouse1, but the sound of the door put me out of focus and jutted my aim off to the left.  The bullet whizzes through the air, and chunks of rock and dust particles fly out from the wall behind the runner.  Too late.  The runner is upon me now, and my only reaction is to frantically hit 'v' as fast as I can. I push him away with the side of my rifle, stumbling it.  This gives me enough time to point my gun in its general direction, wildly firing into the oncoming swarm of zombies.  I waste about twelve rounds before two runners and a walker goes down.  Eight rounds left. Conservation top priority.  I take the time to glance at chat. It's wild. People are arguing. Words whizz by like matrix graphics, and I'm just glad no-one's using voice com.  At this, I hold 'shift' and book it to the corner of the room; there's a keypad and a locked wire-mesh door that leads into a small office.  someone says '6064' In chat.  I punch it in, no response. turn around, gun aimed, fire three more shots. This time more accurate, on point. manage four kills. The door I came out from is frantically juttering open and shut, whilst people battle to open it or close it.  '7175' Someone else says.  I punch it in, key pad flashed green and the door opens.  Inside, a shelf filled with boxes, a computer desk with a handgun resting on it.  I pick it up. 45 cal.  there's also a button in the corner- I press it, shutters are lowered and the street outside is now available to us.  10/10 would be a reluctant hero again.",

            "review_text": "This is a free zombie game that runs better than other games in the genre and gets better dev support too. I've played this game since it came out and I have to say I'm really impressed with it. Yes there are some bugs but they're rarely game breaking and usually not too much of a problem. The weapons are fun to use and actually require a decent amount of skill (what with the lack of crosshairs, limited amount of ammo, and wide variety of melee weapons). The zombies work well too, crawlers, walkers, runners, and kids all provide a bit of variety and can spice up the game/scare the hell out of you. All in all it's a very enjoyable game and I hope the developers continue to work on it and the community continues to support it.   TIPS:  1. Use your sights. 2. If you melee, PUSH the zombies away after every swing.  3. Communicate, even without a mic it's really useful. 4. Don't waste ammo. (Especially on the first few rounds of a survival map) 5. Don't hoard ammo you aren't using, chances are someone else needs it. 6. Don't attack the same zombie at once. It wastes ammo or it clusters people up so they miss their swings.  7. Use the flare gun to call in supplies (Survival). 8. Conserve your energy, if you're out of breath, back away for a few seconds. 9. If you're infected call it out. If there are no pills at all, shoot yourself. 10. Have fun and send the zombies back to hell!",

            "review_text": "This game honestly surprised me. I, myself am not a free to play type of person, in fact I think most, 90% of free-to-plays are absolute ♥♥♥♥ designed to try and suck money out of me. Not this one, this is up there in some of my favorite f2p games, and yes, I'll admit, this game isn't without it's flaws but it's one game that has semi changed my opinion on Free-to-Play.  Let me start with the good, for a Source Game, an engine of 10+ years, this game looks great, apart from zombies looking like they came out of a low budget B-movie horror flick and the no texture bug which appears on the eyes of some characters (I laugh this one away and think of it as an intended bug for immersion) it's pretty good. In some of the settings, they've hidden away a few graphics options that are experimental such as Lens Flare but is worth enabling. NMRiH really immerses you into the thought that you are a survivor and must get through this with it's graphics, the vanilla maps have been designed very well for immersion in mind. The lighting creates this bleak atmosphere that not many other Survival Horror games create, Left 4 Dead (yes the lighting is still very good but not like NMRiH in any way), DayZ to name a few. It keeps to a certain design framework that really wants to keep you immersed and constantly on alert as every dark corner there may be undead lurking. It emphases the use of Flashlights which are possibly one of the best utilities seen in any game I've played.   Away from the Atmosphere and the Graphics, the combat matches this very well. Ammo for guns is rare, something that really does fit a realistic scenario of such a thing happening and it requires you to make every shot count. Melee combat is interesting too as it has an invisible stamina meter, requiring you to time your swings and make every bit of your energy count. Weapons like Sledgehammers, FUBARs and Shovels drain it more but with the chance of one hit kills and possibly killing multiple zombies, other weapons, like Machetes, Hatchets, don't do as much damage but use little stamina, keeping you on in the fight. That moves me onto the next great thing about this game, the variety of weapons and how they each have a destined purpose. Pistols are great, they're all different and have their own specialties. The Beretta M9 is a 9mm Pistol and the ammo is rather common, it's a 2 hit kill and my favorite pistol due to the sights being better than that of the other 9mm, the Glock 17 which has a larger ammo capacity but worse sights, again in my opinion. Weapons are so varied with it's uses that they're all worth trying to match your game style. Would you like to pick up the M16 or would you rather take a more recyclable approach with a Compound Bow.   Other mechanics in this game away from combat is the ability to become infected and must be warded off with Phlanx Pills (a reference to one of my all time favorite novels by Max Brookes - World War Z) or Gene Therapy, which completely cures you. You can barricade entrances with a claw hammer and some wooden planks, end your teammates (or yourself) to rid them of the burden that may encumber you later in game and more. You can even change your character and his voice. I'm not going to go much more in detail with the other mechanics, these are the best ones, so you'll have to encounter some of the other ones in game yourself.   This section is dedicated to the AI and the Level Design. I'm not gonna lie, the AI really needs patching up, it's ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and needs some work. However it's predictable and unpredictable nature (yes the AI is both) keep you on constant alert. An infected teammate has gone down, where the hell could he be? Well he's glitched out running in circles around where you turned. That's one major issue with the game. Away from AI, the levels are really good. If you're playing slowly, they can sometimes take up to 30 minutes to complete and can be quite the blast if you're last man standing. The maps, each and every one of them are unique and require different objectives and many of them have different paths for different playthroughs. Not major though, but something to change up gameplay each time.   All in all NMRiH is a great F2P game, a slightly cancerous community as I've encountered many annoying little kids in my mere 30 hours of gameplay but overall pretty damn good. 8/10.",

The game is 8 Player Co-op and focuses on survival and the atmosphere, you have to collect your weapons and be aware of Ammo and meelee weapons. The game gives a more relestic approach over games like Dead Rising and L4D.  If you like games related to zombies that are unique at the same time, I would recommend this. And it's FREE!

But seriously, this is a really good game. The community is usually very good, met some great people on it. The game it's self is just alot of fun to play with the seemingly endless amount of maps like camp blood (the camp from the friday the 13th movies) or the Night of the Living Dead farm house just to name to cool ones. You can do objective style games like left 4 dead, or you can do pure survival (my favourite). The servers are great, you can really test your self with a straight up survival feel, finding guns and weapons on the floors and dividing ammo like a team. Or you can just spawn guns and unlimited ammo, hell go god mode if you want the wide range of servers allow it all! The graphics though a little on the plain side are much better than other free games imo, i really prefer playing this over other mainstream zombie games because it just feels more real, the lighting and atmosphere is alot darker and creepy and the guns and melee and other items are just nice to use, especially with the ability to aim down sights.  I recommend this a thousand times over and cant wait for NMRIH 2! This is a game worth paying for.",

Finishing a map feels so good. Knowing that you survived an apocalypse, did it with a few people, and got extracted by the military is amazing isn't it? A game this amazing and smartly made is just cool. I would really play it.  Overall score for me:  9.5/10 Fun Factor: Good for halloween gaming and could really make you happy.

Half the pistols have trouble getting instant kills, as of their lower caliber. Not every bite results in infection, the unfortunate zombie swipe might cut deep, and you'll need some good doctor's work, or just some bandages you found on the ground. Your fellow man can screw you over as good as the average horde of zombies(at times they use said horde). Some guy can take all the ammo, and another all the guns. Neither will give in, and you either go along until one of them dies, of kill one now. Killing one now removes the risk of gear loss, but can lead to the collapse of the group.

As a surge of 'free-to-play-and-pay''s hit the market, it is incredibly refreshing to see a title unburdened with any fees or restrictions that is so fun. This game means so much to me that I am personally paying more so that I can feel as though I am helping the developers (Canadians (I think?) that seem so helpful on forums, by the way~) I am really at a loss to what I should say, for experiencing the game yourself will be all the more useful; my words can't do it justice.  Alas, I do realise that a review should be more than ♥♥♥-kissing. So, let's turn on the jazz, grab some Monster, and discuss No More Room in Hell a little more.  This game is not perfect; this should be an expectation void from every game, though. While I, personally, find this slow, co-op-orientated zombie-smashing game fun, I do concede that this would seem strange (if not plain unenjoyable) to someone more inclined to a game like Left 4 Dead. NMRiH is, by no means, one were ammo can be squandered; to make this fact apparent, join any nightmare server running survival maps. You must think about the shots you make, your stamina, your health and the health of those around you, what's behind you... In essense, I feel as though you will enjoy this sort of atmosphere if you like long-term goals, tense points and the relief that will follow. An added bonus to this slower, staggered gameplay as opposed to L4D is that the weapons mean a lot more. A shotgun decimating 2 zombies in a row feels impactful, meaningful; not many games can boast this feeling, at least to me.  There are more superficial complaints that I have heard (third-person animations, voice acting, etc.) that I really do not feel like arguing over. My philosophy on this matter is that if you enjoy the core gameplay of a title, you can look over a lot. Through the updates still applied to this game, I can only expect that NMRiH will improve.   Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hit some of these zed sods with a shovel. Bye!",

That being said there is only one thing I have to say about this game. This game is a zombie lover's dream. It's pretty spot on for the look and feel of the things that made the genre great. There's that feeling of isolation, having to counting your ammo, being forced to rely on people you may not like in order to survive, and of course hordes of the walking dead coming at you at all times. In my opinion it is a game made for fans of the genre by the fans of the genre. Although anyone who enjoys a good game should most assuredly give it a shot as well. There are a few things that need a little more polish but the developers of this game are active in it's community and seem to be always continuing to make this game even better. Even if you don't like the counting the ammo aspect of this game there are more than enough private servers on this game with infinite ammo enabled to get rid of that problem if it isn't your thing (I for one enjoy having to count my shells from time to time because of the challenge it represents). I love how each weapon has it's own distinctive feel (even if it's only a subtle difference) and the little details on each map that displays how much time was put into this game to make it awesome.

Communication is vital for survival.   As mentioned earlier, a good team is vital. A key to a good team (other than not dying 3 seconds after spawning in every time) is communication.

GREEN = Full Health, ORANGE = Medium or Bleeding, RED = you're in the danger zone (DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAANGER ZOOOOOOOOOOOOONE).  Another way to tell what your health status is is by simply looking at your screen and listening to what your character is saying. If your screen is flashing red, then it means you are bleeding and the color on your screen starts fading unless you get a Bandage or First Aid Kit.  It's handy to have a team mate yelling at you to 'TAKE THE FU**ING FIRST AID KIT' or when you're infected and they give you a gun to kill yourself with. THAT is when you know they care and an indication you have a team-mate for life (or for as long as you live, which isn't really that long realistically)  PRO TIP: When melee-ing, don't stand too close to the zombie and ALWAYS PRESS 'V' RIGHT AFTER A MELEE ATTACK.  Trust me, it will save your life.  11/10 would recommend this game to anyone and everyone.",

            "review_text": "For those of you who have played L4D2, you will most likely have come across the realism mode. The difference between realism mode and the normal co-op mode in L4D2 is that in realism mode you cannot see the silhouette of your teammates, items, and you cannot come out of the closet (respawn) when you are dead. Most players take the realism mode as an additional challenge as it adds a certain amount of difficulty to the already challenging expert co-op mode. The aim of L4D2's realism mode is to make the game real so that you can have a taste of reality in L4D2. It works well, though when L4D2's realism mode is pitted against No More Room in Hell, L4D2 looses out in almost all aspects of realism.   The first thing you need to know about No More Room in Hell (NMRH from here on) is that it is a Mod for Source games (Half-Life 2, Portal 2, Counter-Strike: Source, Left 4 Dead 2 ... etc). Meaning, you will need at least one copy of such games installed before you can play it. The game (or mod) itself is free, so don't worry about that. Since NMRH is a mod, you can basically expect graphics and controls very similar to that of Half-Life 2 and other games based upon the source engine. There really isn't anything spectacular about the graphics and controls, so I'll leave it for you t decide for yourself.  After installing NMRH (and maybe a source based game if you have not already done so), you are ready for your first game. You go in, choose a server in a very Counter-Strike manner (opening a server list and clicking on a server you like, which most likely will be a server with the lowest ping and an empty slot), and you wait for your game to load. You will be curious how the game will be. Finally, after somewhat less than a minute (on my gear), the game is finally loaded and ...  ... four empty walls.  Well, to be fair, there are some run down furnitures and the environment is decorated with cracks and dust, but the point is, where are the HUDs (Head-Up Display)? In a typical first-person shooter, there will be numbers representing your health and the amount of ammunition you are currently holding on to. Alright, I was not holding a gun so maybe I don't get to see any numbers representing any bullets. Fine. But what about my health? What I have found out, later on, is that there are no in-game HUDs that represents your health value. On the other hand, health is represented by the colour saturation of your in game graphics - the lower the value of your health is, the lower the colour saturation will be and your screen will look pretty much grayscale-ish before you fall on your face. Also, your screen will be highlighted red if you are injured or infected (the highlight for each condition differs from each other).   After walking around for a bit, triggering green silhouettes whenever you look at items lying around (or red when your backpack is full) and picking them up, I soon come to realize that there actually are HUDs in the game. One is your Fallout-3-like compass (remember, you don't have a map). Another is the item and ammo screen (1, 2). The third are the instructions given, which will pop out in the middle of your screen when you've triggered them. The last one is the number of ammunition you have (at least you get to see how much ammo you have left, phew!).  Speaking about guns, the game tries to make its item system as realistic as possible, just like many other aspects of the game. In order to do so, the game uses something similar to a 'weight system' for its item system (something like Killing Floor, I guess). Larger, heavier and, more importantly, higher dammage items takes up more weight, while lighter, weaker and, generally speaking, more useless items take up less weight. For example, a fire axe, something that can split the skull of the zombies with one charged swing, will take up more space then a torchligh, a little black stick which you can use to shine the places on the zombies where sun don't shine or simply whack them so that they can whack you back and infect you. The same applies for large weapons, such as M4A1, which is definitely much heavier than little hammers used for nailing boards (where do the nails come from, I always wonder). Ammunitions take up space too, so becareful not to take up too many unwanted ammunition types.   What's next after picking up your utensils ... I mean, weapons? Your dinner... I mean, enemy. There are 2 distinctive types of zombies in general: slow and fast. Most of them are slow ones, so you can pretty much blow their head up with a well aimed melee strike with a fire axe or sledge hammer. Melee is always recommended, especially when you have quite a number of temmates to back you up, as ammunitions are highly scarce in game (reality, duh!). Of course, you better not get hit by your enemy. Even if you do get hit by an enemy, which will happen at least once in every game, you better not get infested, as you will definitely and inevitably die, with your corpse rising as a fast zombie, running towards your living comrades and trying to kill them. Well, its actually kind of nice watching your comrades trying to fight your zombified self. Maybe it's because you get kind of envy of them for being alive, and they can't hear you on chat once you are dead.   For the general picture, this game is bleak, barren and aims to be highly realistic. As a matter of fact, it is actually succeeding in terms of realism because when I first played it, the realism bores me to tears (I was playing alone). Whacking zombie after zombie, trying to meet the objectives which is to whack more zombies is not as entertaining as it seems, so much so that I initially have removed the game from my list (it's free anyway). But then, a Korean friend of mine started playing, so I reinstalled the game and picked it up again and, to be honest, playing NMRH with friends has a type of peculiar yet interesting taste to it. It is actually fun when you sit back, strode through the zombified garden with your friend, help each other out when in need, laugh at your peers that fell in battle, and get laughed at when your zombified peers start tearing you apart. Yeah, that is how some of my nights are spent.  NMRH is an interesting game when you play with a bunch of people. It will amaze you how barren and inconvenient reality is, and how a tiny little mistake can amplify and manifest into a giant globe of chaos. It's not a complicated game, so anyone can go in, shoot a few, get killed, and watch your zombified self run wild and get killed again. It's free anyway. Still, be warned that you should have your mobile phone or tablet or a book with you, as you might have to wait for a long long while before you can play again once you are dead. Reality, yeah?  P.S. [Easter Egg] If you ever play the map Chinatown, look out for a blue sign saying '按摩你的屁股'. It literally means 'massage your backside'.",

            "review_text": "The amount of fun to be had in No More Room in Hell is purely based on who you play with.  Yes, this may also be true for the majority of online multiplayer games, but it is especially true when it comes to cooperative games. No More Room in Hell is less a game, and much more a social experience. If the social mechanics are removed, or non-existent, there is zero to no enjoyment to be found here. Unfortunately, many times you join a server, no one is communicating by voice. Not even via the text chat. This limits the overall gaming experience of No More Room in Hell to a valueless venture into a boring and uneventful zombie apocalypse scenario. Other times, you will join a server and be in the presence of voice chatters who are playing very loud music or TV in the background, or people who are only interested in communicating and playing with their friend, in their common language that no one else understands, while ignoring everything and everyone else. Then there are the people you will find that aren't actually playing the game for its purpose at all. Luckily, there are the rare times that you join a server and most, if not all people involved are communicating well, attempting to succeed in the game's objectives, and being helpful in the survival of all participants. People from all over the world, working together. Sadly, these perfect moments in No More Room in Hell are few and far between.  The Source Engine server browser has its many known faults, and blacklisting servers often does not work. There are many servers out there that ignore the game's purpose in every way possible. These servers have taken No More Room in Hell and spoiled every objective, every gameplay mechanic, and have made it their own worthless variation of it. If you join them, you will find that the standard game's survival and cooperative mechanics have been replaced with unlimited ammo, a free and unlimited guns menu, and other server-side changes, such as automatic respawns and other options that are there to simply ruin the standard game. Those servers are not playing the game created by the developers.  No More Room in Hell has a surprising amount of content for being a completely free game, and the developers seem to be devoted to its continued success with frequent and sizable patches and updates. They are often responding to posts in the Steam forums, and sometimes can even be found playing the game and answering questions using the voice chat. The game may be quite unpolished in certain areas and low budget, but for it being 100% free, it's still impressive at some level. Hit detection when it comes to melee combat is definitely an area that takes some getting used to, but once you learn how to handle the various melee weapons, it does become satisfying to down zombies with one hit. The firearms also feel agreeable, and collecting then exchanging ammo with the other survivors can be very fun. At the moment, there are two game modes. One is objective based, while the other is centered on defense of designated areas and wave survival. Both are extremely enjoyable if played with the right group of people.   Playing the server lottery in a cooperative game can be disappointing, but if you are lucky enough to be able to find a server with people playing the game to its full potential, No More Room in Hell can be a lot of fun. It's just a shame that most people aren't playing the game that No More Room in Hell is intended to be.  No More Room in Hell is good.",

One thing that I enjoyed was the Infected gimmick, when you get hit by a zombie you may became infected and when you die your character will became a zombie and attack other players, sadly you can't play with your zombie form which is a bad choice in my opinion, the zombie form should be playable it would be fun to those players who died and will neevr respawn till the end of the game, that's another problem the respawn system...it doesn't exist, sometimes you'll need to exit the server and enter again so you can keep playing, I know they tried to be realistic I mean you can't respawn in the real world but c'mon this is a video game and waiting for a bunch of people who don't know the objectiev of the mission todie so you can play again is a frustrating event not a fun one. One thing that I hate is when you're bleeding,the bleeding won't stop till you use a bandage, while this sounds normal to those who haevn't played the game, believe meits annoying, its realistic so I shouldn't compain I know but it's still an annoying thing due to the ammount of bandages in the maps. There are many maps though I think there are only 3 adventure of objective maps, you know its like Left 4 Dead,you need to kill Zombies and get to a certain checkpoint to be rescued, these are the ones I play the most, the other maps are all about Zombie waevs and surviving, I don't play these often because I hate this type of game, its always the same old thing, it may get fun after some time when Ammo and guns are almost gone the zombies keep coming but, I don't see the appeal.  The weapons are good and there's a lot of them, there's not a lot of Medic Kits which in my opinion is good because it gies vthe game a realistic touch and a nice challenge, however the melee weapons could be better. The graphics are decent but they should have more player models (male and female), the ones that can be selected are nothing special, 3 of them look cool but the others like the 'Fat man with vintage glasses' should be deleted and in his place they should place a Police officer or a female character I don't know. I could go on and on but you know what its not perfect and I consider it a guilty pleasure, it may not be Left 4 Dead but heck its not a bad game and you can have a lot of fun with it, try it but remember, team work is a a valuvable key to win this game if you play this as a lonely wolf you won't go far. I do recommed this game to all zombie fans and people who just enjoy hard games.",

            "review_text": "No More Room is a survival horror FPS zombie game. Weapons are limited, so survivors have to make the best of them. Also, there are two types of gamemodes. In the survival gamemode, there are zones to maintain. The zones can be defended if the imposing zombies are killed, however if the zones fall, the survivors lose. In the objective gamemode, survivors complete a series of tasks, so that they can be safely extracted. If the survivors die or take too long to reach the point of extraction, they lose. A player can run a LAN server that any other local player can join, but assuming there aren't any local players in the area, it could be played as a singleplayer server. If a player wants to play with other specific players, they could run a multiplayer server. A multiplayer server would show up on the Internet, so any other player could join, but servers can be protected by passwords. If a player runs their own server, their latency will be pretty low, but the latency of players connecting to their server will be significantly higher. Running a LAN server is ideal for achievements, many of which can be obtained by getting a certain number of kills with the different weapons in the game. No More Room in Hell is free and players can even create their own maps. Good game, 9/10.",

            "review_text": "No More Room in Hell is an amazing Co-Op Survival game with a lot of emphasis on the Co-Op. If you don't work together, you'll fall victim to the hordes. This game has tons of polish, and is very well supported by the developers. It's basically what I describe as a realistic Left 4 Dead. It's the same basic concept, a team of players have to work together to complete objectives while avoiding hordes of zombies. Notice how I said AVOID. More often than not, killing zombies is simply not worth your time unless it's absolutely necessary. Zombies are slow for the most part, except for some runners and the occasional child, but they are also quite resilient. You are not very powerful and tire quickly, so it takes some thought before taking on a horde. You can also take bleeding damage, and even get infected, which makes fighting even more dangerous. Basically, cooperation is the name of the game, and this is an experience not to be missed for zombie fans and co-op fans alike.",

You may be thinking, 'its a free game , it will be &amp;*$% and will have all those micro transactions and yeah im hard ' but your wrong, its a mix of Gmod and HL2 and the result is amazing- it has suvival modes similar to COD zombies but more realistic with melee weapons and indefinate AMMO conservation, but it also has a objective mode, like you need to get to an area by fixing a car to ram a wall, pick the lock on a gate, find a key, find fuel for a genortor to open a door and more. The only slight annoyence is that AMMO is hard to find for your weapon, but the AMMO will fit a weapon which is nearby, unless your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ of a teamate takes it. Overall i r8 this 9/10, and any way, if its not for you, its free so just hit that uninstall button, the only reasson i uninstalled is because i moved hose so i wiped my memory on my laptop and reinstalled it when i got to my new place, idek why i wiped it in the first place tbh.",

Now don't get me wrong, I DO recommend this game, but I am writing this as a review to things you will probably find wrong with it.    So here we go: -Its hard to find a server that is the default gametype. Yes you can type Classic into the filter but even then a lot of servers you will join will have changes made to them. -Like most Source games, you cannot just create a session for you and a friend to hop onto. Which means you have to join a server or create one. So don't expect to just play with a friend or two without randoms joining.  -With that being said, randoms cause a lot of lag. This already difficult game, (if playing on 'Classic') now becomes 100x harder with lag due to zombies killing you in 3 - 8 hits as you are depending on your melee weapon. (Tip: Melee then Shove, Melee then Shove) -Maps do seem to bug out somtimes, doors will not open, getting stuck inside objects, etc. It doesn't happen often, but it's general Source bugs. -Small learning curve. Expect to die a lot the first few times you play. But it does become extremely addictive. -It could just be me, because im not a big fan of Survival/Wave type games. But the Survival Maps quickly become boring and seem a bit too easy compared to Objective/Linear maps. - Only 3 types of zombies that arent all that different in terms of combat. Slow walkers, Runner and Children. (Children being just a smaller and weaker Runner) This isn't really a problem, due to the fact none of the zombies are that hard to kill. Its more a numbers game.  Anyways, like I said I DO recommend this game because it is fun, it is addicting, it is hard. But these problems were the largest that popped out at me. My friends had the same gripes aswell. Add in easy session creation so you can just play with friends on the fly without joining/creating a server and I would pay $30+ for this game.",

It's not good enough to spend money on. polish is something it needs. all games should penalize you for not playing correctly or just sucking, but it's a whole other thing when the game penalizes you soley on luck. the hit boxes need to be fixed is my main con, yet that's just the tip of the iceberg. what i'm talking about though is when i'm using a melee weapon and I have a runner coming at me, I power swing, hit it in the head, dead one hit, all good all fine. then another comes up to be i do the same exact thing and for whatever reason the hit mark gets in the chest, it beats me silly and I die. this is a constant thing, and something i can stand solely on the game being free. also mission markers will dissapear when in survival mode, friends will die and their names will float around, sometimes crawling zeds will stand up (especially when moving into an obstacle). items will get stuck and dissallow you from using them. Most of these are minor flaws, but going back I can tell you another MAJOR flaw and that's with game design: there's no respawning, WHICH IS FINE, or WOULD be fine if they game clearer ♥♥♥♥ing objectives. they too little often highlight the objective which makes it a pain for anybody who watching who's already died, it's not on the surviving player, it's not on the people who want to play the game, it's on the sheer lack of information the game gives the survivors to progress which in turn draws out a match much much longer than wanted. especially when considering the maps change so infrequently which NOBODY seems to like.

This game has many aspects to the game that make it so good such as the many weapons you can choose from, 2 different game modes you can play, many different maps with many codes that you have to learn on your own or the game tells you in some way from the story of that map. 2 different map types are present: Official and UnOfficial for both the Objective maps and the Survival maps. Then there is the scavenging factor, Ammo is scarce on maps sometimes because of the random generation on the maps. That's right, each map doesn't have the same weapons and ammo and objectives, etc that are in the same place. Everything except for the map itself and the props, codes, and minor shiz like that. Some maps have a lot of ammo and guns with small amount of melee, sometimes the other way around, sometimes in between. I have had some weird ♥♥♥♥ happen in my time on the game and some of that time was chaos and confusion. Codes on some maps are the same, some aren't. On objective maps if you all die, you get a new way to reach the end of the mission. It goes on like that until you've died so much and tried so hard that the map has run out of ways to give you a route and changes the map. That or the time runs out on the map. The words 'People suck ♥♥♥' sometimes doesn't make up for the fact that some people are just IDIOTS on games like this. Time will only tell if you are good at this game at the beginning or not. If not, get better. Any more questions can be answered by the wiki and stuff like that. Have fun, don't be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, etc etc. Goodbye.",

The Aim of the game is to survive as long as possibe agains the constant horde of Zombies. The game is in pretty early stages (Or is when I am writing this) and has several bugs. But it never fails to deliver a fun and scary experience.  The best part of the game is it's complete differences to most games like 'Left 4 Dead' and 'Dead Rising'. Sure you are in a First person perspective like in (L4D) but you havent got the equipment all set out at the start which in turn means you have to look for any around the area/map.  TIP FROM ME: Go for the Pistol and Flashlight along with a Mele Weapon of one's choice.  There is also the realism of the game. If you are bitten in (L4D) Cool 1% is taken off and you can heal in no time. But in 'NMRIH' there is the Infection and Bleeding System. Very Rarely will you bleed to death. Almost 98% of the time you will be Infected and will require pills (Ha Louis) to get better, But it's not a one time thing. After a while the pills effects wear off and the Infection takes hold again, So if you are out there in the world alone of with friends, it is best to carry a plenteful supply of pills.  Another cool thing is the addition of different types of Zombies. Sure there was many in (L4D) but in 'NMIRH' there are: Runners Children Zombies Walkers  I never thought I would be so scared of a child in my life. Anyway enough rambling from me!

Of course it has the whole Left 4 Dead style of campaign; however, ammo is scarce and you have to deal with types of situations. The fact that infection is something that can only be delayed is something I have not seen with many games from this generation of games. I give this game more credit than some of the zombie survival games because. In other zombie games, you only sit in a room crouching over a window facing your gun over the wooden platform to shoot the zombies. It doesn't add to the immersion of 'human ability.' What I am trying to get at, is that it requires more than just your basic game style. It requires you to literally depend on your team and if your team is 'shy' or REALLY! immersed in the game, panic. I've played with groups of people who stayed together, they were having fun and all, but you can tell what was happening. At this point I try to break it and go on an axe-spree to see if anyone is alright. I adore that part of this game. Even the mechanics of it seem a bit polished to me. They give you stuff, but nothing that would let you rush in. Unless it's your first time you think you can, but it really does lead down to strategic ways to get around a map.   The only thing I would consider bad for this game is the few glitches I come across, like grabbing specific ammo for your gun. It won't let you grab it all the time oddly. Also I had several times happen when I got infected by air. I know a zombie did hit me, but he was really out of distance and somehow smacked a kiss to me.   The immerson, the gameplay, the style is why I am rating this as a game to play. The mechanics, the physics, they are good and all, they just need a bit of tweaking. Like I got slingshoted in the air by trying to grab an item that fell into a invisible barrier and took fall damage. Was a great scene, nonetheless, was a glitch/bug.",

Some guns are completely worthless (Beretta 3 shots to head) but other than that it just makes the scenario harder, from what ive seen it places you in different scenarios for every objective map, very unique and fun.

PROS:  + The game is free  + You can kill children  + You can play with friends + Zombies ;3 + Not many characters so you don't spend time who you want to be + There's a female character (Although there's only one)  CONS:  - There isn't enough loot around, you can't find any medkits or bandages 90% of the time.  - Guns are bad, they do little damage (Sometimes 3 headshots to kill 1 zombie) and you have to be lucky enough to find bullets (Which you won't)  - Everything you do is very slow, switching weapons, reloading, swinging a melee weapon etc.  - Getting infected is not cool, its annoying and delays the inevitable, pills will only keep you alive for about 7.4 seconds longer.  - If there are multiple people playing, good luck finding a good item.  - Even with 0 ping, melee weapons are very hard to use because you trade hits with zombies most of the time, and you are likely going to get infected.  - You get 'tired' very fast, 3 swings with a sledgehammer and you have to wait 10 hours until you can swing it again.  - The melee weapons are better than guns, but still you will miss most of your swings even at point blank range.  - If you shove a zombie back, they can still attack or grab you immediately after.  - When you get surrounded by a horde of zombies you have to spend a LONG time fighting them off if you cannot run, this becomes tedious and boring.  - The voice acting is not good, the characters sound depressed.  - You movement is restricted, (eg - can't jump on top of cars), it's always at 'ground level' so it becomes frustrating to move around the map.  - You cannot use a flashlight with a 2 handed weapon, this sucks because most of the maps are very dark and all the rifles are 2 handed and the good melee weapons are also 2 handed.  - There's little replay value because of the repetitiveness of the objectives.  - You can't see your own HP, someone has to tell you the color of your name above your head so you can estimate it.  - You can only carry a limited amount of things due to the weight limit.  - You can't carry 2 of the same thing (eg - can't carry 2 medkits or 2 bandages or 2 pills)   Overall this game is great xd",

Now onto the game itself I had a lot of fun playing it for the first few hours then got some friends to join as well and we had a blast with it! Because we didn't know what to do, really. The combat mechanic is quite simple you can either use your fist, melee weapons such as a fireaxe, and guns to clear any zombies coming at you the choice is yours. You can even choose to avoid the zombie if want!   So far I've read some review that says it's 'impossible' to shove the zombie away once you have come up to them and attack them with some sort of weapon, that is merely false. It's possible just press the shove button right after you attack, quite easy if you ask me.  Like I stated up above the game is fun if your a first-timer and with friends! Once you've get use to it you can easily clear objective maps without killing a zombie by yourself!!!",

It does away with the Left 4 Dead (and other similar games) method of 'I'm going to tear through this zombie horde with my guns and run to the exit'. In No More Room in Hell, you will be hard pressed to find two clips for a pistol much less an AK-47 with ~500 rounds (cough L4D cough). This makes the zombie apocalypse seem much more real, and it really reminds me of the TV show “The Walking Dead”. By the same coin, survival time is greatly lengthened with more people playing together, just like it would be in a real life zombie outbreak. If you are having trouble finishing a level, find or make some friends and try to go through the level together.   There is no reason why you shouldn't try this game. It doesn't require Half Life 2, and it runs on the freely available Source SDK Base. If you are tired of playing Left 4 Dead or love “The Walking Dead”, you will probably like this game. At the very least, give it a try.  Verdict: 9.8/10 Because the ammo is unbelievably scarce (you can pick up two boxes of ammo and sometimes get fewer than five bullets) [-0.1] and that you realistically cannot do an objective map by yourself since the zombies respawn [-0.1]. Otherwise, it is a very good game that accurately simulates a zombie apocalypse.",

It's focused on atmosphere and the experience of being challenged more than it is about action itself. If you're looking for action you're better off with L4D2. This is much more than just an action game. Single zombies are usually fairly easy to handle (if you have a melee weapon or a gun). Large groups can be challenging, especially because you run out of ammo and stamina quickly.  One silly thing is that in scenario modes there are spawn points for zombies (often in rooms with no windows and one entrance), so at times you will find yourself attacked from behind by a randomly spawned zombie just after you had cleared a certain area or part of a building. This can seriously ruin the mood.  Sometimes the game is kind of cryptic, and requires you to use very specific items for certain tasks, while at other times virtually any item will do (a good example is having to use a chainsaw to cut through planks in the attic, while being able to pry them off in almost all other areas in game).  Online multiplayer is what ruins the game (at least for me it does). While single-player and LAN games are indeed fun and entertaining, playing with random people might ruin the game for you. You will come across people making fart sounds on voice channel and killing you for ammo and resources. The devs give you no tools to deal with that other than leaving the game and joining another one with hopes of a better outcome.",

            "review_text": "Let's nutshell this:  Pros: -Incredibly survival based. You don't know how many bullets until you check your gun, for example. Your only indication of health is your vision. -Realistic feeling of infection. Eyes will strain up. Your survivor will start to panic. All the way until he/she suddenly zombifies and goes after your friends. -Good use of putting up barricades. Barricade animation could use some work, but is overall better than most other games. -Unique reloading animations depending on gun used and how many bullets are left. -Major focus on headshots. Torso shots are just not worth it. -Incredibly challenging overall. -Lovely soundtrack. Takes me back to NIN's Ghosts album. -Amazing with friends. -It's free. I'm not sure if HL2 is required, so consider downloading and starting it first to see if HL2 is required. If HL2 is required, then go buy HL2 as well. There's really no reason for anyone to not have that game anyway.  Cons: -The L4D community is here. That means everyone joins a team-based game and does nothing but kill teammates, troll around, or lone wolf everything. -Ammo is unrealistic. One example would be a house that has a sniper rifle sitting next to a big box that looks like the casing for said rifle. Guess how many bullets it has, despite looking like it's against a stash? Two. Yes. Just two. -Mechanics are archaic. Weapon hits don't look as if they connect, as range of the swing and the actual range are incredibly different. This is also the case with zombie grabs. -Similar to other horror survival games that aren't finished. Falling so much as a foot could probably kill you. -Interface, servers, and pretty much everything in the game uses the same engine as Half-life 2, since it is technically a mod. That means that there is a huge lack in ease of use, and the overall gamepad use has a lot of work ahead of itself. This also means that even the 'dedicated' servers are really just user servers. And yes. There isn't very much network optimization in this, causing terrible results with lag. In a zombie game, that is bad news. -Graphics feel very unoptimized for this type of game. What would net you 80fps in Half-Life 2 will probably net you 40fps here. This really shouldn't be the case, as the graphics are just about the same, if not worse than Half-Life 2. -I'm just going to list 'L4D Community' here again, because literally everyone in the game has no clue what they're doing and will refuse to be useful. -Ammo weighs way more than it should, which is bad considering that there is no help to indicate what ammo goes with what gun. I'm not kidding. Picking up three boxes of shells will literally take up 1/4 of your overall inventory. -While I'm at it, let me emphasize that ammo is VERY PICKY in this game. Good luck finding the right gun for the right ammo most of the time. Keep a sledgehammer with you at all times.  So there you have it. Think 'Dead Island meets Left 4 Dead....with an engine that might as well be from the late 90s.' ...but when you create a game hell-bent on survival, or else death, and yet you have an entire community that is acting on just the opposite... This is just not a game worth playing with strangers, and (thanks to the impressive 8 player max) that's most likely what you'll be paired up with through most of the game.",

The game is kind of glitchy but hey, it free to play.  Many servers are on the classic setting which basically means that once you die, you're dead until the end. That's my one main beef with the game. It's a game, people want to play, they don't want wait forever to see if the team wipes or finishes it. They need to make that a hardcore setting, for those that wish to challenge themselves. Because you will die at least once or twice in a session.   The good thing is that there are some casual servers which allow you to respawn after a timer.  The guns and ammo are pretty thin on vanilla servers. if that's not your thing, there are many 'Choose your gear' servers as well. When you spawn, you choose some gear and get back to playing.  (TL;DR) At the end of the day, I think this is worth the DL because it's free. It gave me a few hours of enjoyment and I'll probably come back and play again some time.",

Of course the community adding to the game is nice and all, but when it's rediculous ♥♥♥♥ that's the opposite of what the game tries to achieve, then there's a problem.  If you're going to play then get a couple of friends to tag along in either private matches or on public servers. It's sadly gotten to the point where it's only fun to TK or troll other players as most of them deserve it as they ruin games by instantly snatching up as many weapons and ammo they can find and then depositing it somehwere around the map.  It's extremely common to see someone get swarmed by 6 zombies and then you seeing an explosion of weapons and ammo comically thrown everywhere as they collapse to the ground. Sadly this mindset is the reason why players rarely help eachother unless their friends, the amount of times im grabbed by 3 zombies and the guy next to me doesnt even have the courtesy to push them off just so he can take my single clip of 9mm ammo when i die is just disturbing.  Overall, the gameplay of this game is somewhat repetetive as the devs havent really added much to it in a while, luckily though each map has 2 paths to take in objective mode so the game can vary. Other than that and the community it's somewhat fun to play but i do stress the fact that you require a friend or two as a solo experience is quite painful unless you troll or know what you're doing.",

It will only depend on the developers choice for future updates that will change my mind, but as it is right now i would probably go look for another zombie game like Contagion or something if you want a decent zombie game. A lot of people might not like Contagion for some reason, but i find it really enjoyable and ive had a great experience with that game from beta till after release.  I would rate NMRiH (No More Room in Hell) a 3 or 4 out of 10 because of the great animating and nicely done weapons.

If it's realistic to not have a tooltip for the ammo type that you're pointing at, well... in the real world, you could pick up and READ THE BOX in front of your face, rather than at arm's length. You would also have an idea of how much spare ammo you were carrying; hiding the UI until you hold a button doesn't make the game more 'realistic', it's a contrived way of limiting your available information. Could have been implemented another way; you could have to look down at your cargo pants and see how many boxes you have stuffed into your pockets, or visually inspect your revolver or clip to count ammo left. Anyway, I think I would have found this fun if I played it 7 or 8 years ago, but it's hard to hold this up against more modern, standalone titles with more sophistication, or the many other games jumping all over the zombie survival bandwagon.",

If I click my mouse to attack, I should attack. I shouldn't stand there like a mouth-breathing idiot for three seconds, then wind up, and then attack five seconds later. This 'combat' (anal ♥♥♥♥) is slower than the knife in the first Resident Evil game and half as effective.   I realize it's supposed to be a 'realistic' survival horror kind of game and not a Left for Dead kind of game, but dumbing down the controls and making the players attack slower than the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zombies they're fighting is just ridiculous. Couple it with one magazine of ammo and extremely poor hitbox detection and you have yourself shooting zombies in the head two to three times before the server 'sees' it and kills the zombie, that is, if they aren't already on top of you in a ground-n-pound. Plus, when wielding a melee weapon the right mouse button doesn't seem to do anything, and you have to hunt down the default 'V' key to shove zombies away when they get too close.   Whoever designed these controls needs to be fed to a pack of rabid zombies. I don't know where you get off naming this game 'No More Room in Hell' because I'll tell you: Hell is not full. Hell is being stuck playing this awful game.   Why even have weapons? Why not just make left mouse turn your character around, pull down his pants, and bend over?",

            "review_text": "This is a slow, terrible and cumbersome first person shooter mod for Half Life 2 that feels like a hardcore version of Left 4 Dead. Your multiplayer co-op party needs to carry out objectives in maps and mostly just stay alive. Its pretty easy to stay alive and not die, but its difficult to do anything else. First of all, the game is pretty slow. I mean the animations of your character are slow. When you switch to a flash light, it is always off to start with, then you need to turn it on.... WITH BOTH HANDS! Watch as your character slowly turns on a flashlight with his left hand while holding it with his right. Then there's the inventory system that has a good use of space management. The catch is that you really can't hold all that much. Your ammo takes up space, which is logical, its just I can't imagine when it comes down to carrying a sledge hammer, flashlight and a rifle that you can't carry all three at once.  You walk pretty slow (there is a sprint button), which is okay, but you swing pretty slow and the zombies shuffle their way toward you. Oh and when you get bitten, its like a poison that will slowly drain your health until you're dead. Once you're dead, your character becomes a zombie while you spectate as a ghost. Reloading takes quite a while, but maybe other video games have spoiled me into reloading fast when the reality is that it takes a while.  Carrying things is a chore, don't drop a key next to a door, because you'll never be able to pinpoint the key on the ground from the door. Maps have invisible walls preventing exploration, even when it looks like there is exploration.  Another downside is, this isn't really a campaign, its just more of a series of multi player co-op maps. Left 4 Dead is just better. There's a reason why this took 2 years to make it to Steam. Its just a cumbersome game and maybe that adds to the survival horror aspect, but eh its not for me. This isn't an action game, its a slow beast walking toward you when you can't reload your rifle fast enough.",

I love this game... 2. this game is ♥♥♥♥ 3. this game is free 4. this game is DEFINENTLY NOT PAY TO WIN. 5. this game is cod and dayz combined... 6. somewhat good graphics. 7. I played this game for a year or so and then it got boring. This gam eis fun at first and then just gets boring after a while. 8. pretty cool survival type servers. 9. FU**ING A**HOLE DI**WEEDS FOR TEAMMATES! 10. Not many good servers anymore. THERE YA GO! Short sweet and straight to the point. I like it, i also hate it. the people on this game are disrespectfull half the time. THey ask for a weapon... you give it to them... they shoot you in the face and take the rest of your gear,,, you rage quit... they send you a message saying( and i quote ) 'RAGE MUCH BRAH?'... you shoot yourselve in the jugular... your mom comes into your room and screams at your dead bleeding body on the floor... she rushes you to the hospital, while all the way your spurting blood out of your throght... you get to hospital... you die in the waiting room because nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ about you...",

Ok i cant exagerate that enough, this is a top notch zombie game if i may say so, you may be like 'But omg dayz, omg what about other fps zgames like Dead Island and Left 4 Dead?' yea...those are FUN...this is harder than your daddy when he wakes up in the morning. when you join a server, you may be waiting for the default weapon, the control layout tutorial, the stretched out hand waiting to hold yours as you trot through this game....all i can say 'HAHAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHA! THATS FOOKING HILARIOUS!', but no seriously this game will mentally 'Kick' you in the face as hard as it can, as many times as it can. so before you can play this game you need to learn how to respect a game like this, this is no infinite ammo, one bash with a axe and zombies dead BS no its more like the one slap at YOU and YOUR DEAD. you may be waiting for the hallway with 1-3 zombies so you can get used to the walker, the runner, the kiddies (YES THEY HAVE KIDS, THEY RUN LIKE HELL AND ARE SHORT AND HARD TO HIT! P.S LITTLE GIRL AND BLACK BOY....YOU WERE WARNED!) but this does not happen AT ALL its more like, lets shove 10-20 at you at once, lets make you defend a door your trying to go out of, lets make them think if they team up in the gun shop with all the ammo they just got, they can clear the city...yea, not gonna work, they respawn, and you run out of ammo period.   So when and if you do complete a mission, your about out of breath and on the verge of having a stroke, you may be thinking 'Pfft this guys lying, he doesent no ♥♥♥♥'....trust me, read the other reviews THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT GAME!   but to sum it up, best free fps zombie game on the planet, low graphics meaning you can play it on a low grad lap top, lots of tools to figure out if they will actually kill what you intend to use them on, and loads of fun, i give this a gazzilion out of 10 because it is a game that gets to the point of, your here, your dead, get use to it =).....",

The problem is that most of the time you will be in a server full of histeric pre adolescent trying to troll you as hard as they can.  Positive:  +Real free to play game. This is the real ♥♥♥♥♥ not like other freemium scams that sells you the best stuff.  +Realistic gameplay. It's almost as real as source can be. It's good because there is already a bunch of zombie games that fills you with bullets and weapons (L4D1&amp;2) so NMRIH adds something new to the gaming universe. Yes, the learning curve IS a cliff but won't be like that in a real world? I mean if a zombie apocalypse takes place most of us won't be able to survive comfortably until we learn by force a lot of things. This is somewhat like that: taking all the juice require reading some tutorials avaible online or by experience.  +Extended gameplay. There are a lot's of maps/opportunities, and two gameplays. There are also third party maps that add even more posibilities.  +Active development. Developers are adding things constantly. For example in August they added a new weapon, three characters and four maps. There is a release at 3/4 months so it gives you an excuse to come back time to time.  Negative:  -50% of the players are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who doesn't even try it. The best way of playing this is being aware of all the posibilites out there, picking just what you need and doing things not just for you alone but for everyone (like carrying ammo or weapons to a safe place). But most of the time you will see people picking up everything just because they don't know how this works. They will get killed fast and they will eat you as a zombie.  -20% of the players are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who will troll you. There are some that doesn't care but also there are others who care enough to make everybody elses life more ♥♥♥♥♥♥. Both groups are a pain in the ♥♥♥. So be prepare of trolls blocking hallways, stealing weapons and ammo they don't need or won't use. Don't waste your time going to a TK server. You will get killed by a 15 years old boy who will laugh at you like if they were 8 years old.  -You need at least 5 non-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s players more to have real fun here. And sometimes you only need one good troll to screw it all. So the posibilities of a good game are really small.  Conclusion:  Give this a try. It's free. Luckily enough it will give you one of the most satifsactory experiences avaible nowadays. You can also create your own server which will give you the posibility of get rid of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s. (up to 8 players so you don't need a supercomputer neither a corporative internet connection).  Score:  Game: 9/10  Community: 4/10  Gameplay: 5/10 (it can be 10/10 if you get into a nice server).",

The animated healing (stitches, cutting thread, painkillers etc.) add a sense of realism as apposed to some games where you jusy collect a health pack. Also there being no HUD is also something that I love, it makes you always hold 'R' to ckeck how much ammo you have and then your character shouts it outloud.

This game is not very known around the globe, but a lot of youtubers have done series about this game in 2013, when the game came out, like Pewdiepie.  The Game is not just good from his gameplay but actually from his updates, which made the game a lot better past in 2013.  The Developers did a great job with the Animations for example, the way you put a medic kit, In the game you see your own bare hands cleaning up your own wounds and a great work from the designers with the main scenes and the quality of the game.  Related to the 2 official mode in the game, Survival (NMS) and Objective (NMO) the one that I most prefer is 'nmo', going with a team, which can be made by your friends(premades) or with random people, which the main objective is going to the rescue zone (Extraction).  I'm from Portugal and this game gave me some few skills like, knowing how to speak a better and current English, how you can survive out there without help and treat people in a different way because some day in our life this can happen, like catastrophies so I really recommend this game, is the best game that you can actuall play.",

            "review_text": "We've all wanted that zombie game. That 'one'. you know what i'm talking about. the one in which the zombies actually shuffle at you because you're gun went off by accident. That one that lets you take the decisions into your own hands, like letting an infected friend live because they gave you the last of the ammo later. then waking away alone because everyone was killed. The guilt. The fear. The excitement of watching a long lived character put a gun in his or her mouth because they know they won't survive seeing another zombie child eating an ally, because they were too scared to blow its brains out.   The wait is over. This game has it all. realism, challenge, and even buttons for suicide, pulling out the magazine to check how many bullets you have left, and even one for shoving those little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s away from you.   But in honesty, what really sold it for me, was the fact that every bite could be your last chance. I play with my sister a lot. we're really into the genre, me especially, and we needed something new since standalones glitches and disappointments. Soon we'll be trying out with the 8 players, but so far wwe're following the advice, and sticking to friends. as an example of the amazing experiences we have had so far.   Chinatown. The streets above us no longer bustle with the busy footsteps of strangers, but with the familiarity of the dead. The End has come. Yet we have just begun. We'd scouted the streets many times before, and had even killed a few of them, with our short notice combination of weapons, ranging from old rusty pipes, to huge Rebars. I could tell you about the many times we'd attempted to reach the gun shop from the subway, but the tries were a many. it was the final time, however, that I have told on many occasions.   Me and my sister had held off enough of the horde to fuel the generator of the door to finally get it open. We'd already raided the gun shop, but with such a little amount of ammo, it was still unclear whether we'd make it. I reached for the door switch, and praised the heavens. the door opened, and we were free. I was the first to duck under it as it rose, my sister the second, just barely making it through. What we didn't expect, that there was another horde waiting on the other side. because of our experience in the risky task, we had to make the decision to run through them. unfortunatley, I'd learned to travle light with small arms, whilst my sister had an experience in rifles. I'd seen the difficulty in loading them, when she covered me in the shop whislt I scrounged and searched for the ammo type for my favourite gun, the .22 pistol. She had favoured the SKS, but was betrayed when her ammo count became nil. whilst she moved backwards deeper into the sanctuary of shelves and bodies, she neglected to watch her back. I had managed to load in time, i aimed the pistol over the shelves that divided us, firing a pellet into the rotting corpse's head.   This moment of heroism was briefly lived. As we avoided the hoard in the second part of the street, we'd spotted an alley. I kept running through and pushed as many as i could, but neglected to note how the dead do not stop their stalkerish ways. I made it through the alley to find a Beretta pistol and more ammo, along with a crowbar. I splattered a zombies head as it closed in on me, but was too late to make it back to save my sister from the horde. As I ran back to save her, she was bitten. A bite means infection, but we would have still find a way to sustain it, until at least we were rescued. But this dream was shattered as i saw her still be surrounded by the rest of them. I quickly had to attend to the danger that i was still presented with, splitting three more heads with the gun. The time was enough for my sister to rise again. I turned back in time, just to shoot my second to last bullet into her head. maybe as a sign of thanks for the times she had led me, or as a way of avoiding the regret of not running in to save her. Not that any of it mattered anyway, as the last bullet was spent on myself.   besides, we could always do it again.",

The soundtrack and ambient sounds bring the game to life better than others because it all fits really well with the surroundings and the condition you (the player) is in.  When playing the game you dont have a HUD, only the closing-in effect of either Bleeding out or being Infected, but that you can check your gun clip/magazine any time makes it fun for me and different to others.  Each map, well, most maps, have their own little story to it, something to read to tell you what happened while the game loads instead of just waiting and staring at a blank screen,challenging, but fun, objectives to complete as well is included which is awesome.

            "review_text": "I recommend this game to zombie game fans, but, for others, I am skeptical that you will be among those to like this game.  I love this game, I really do, but, after taking a long break from it, I discovered why it got a little stale over prolonged periods of play. Like the Doom franchise, you have to get from Point A to Point B, but with objectives to do so in between to get there. That being said, the majority of the time, it's fun to panic with a team through zombie infested streets and tunnels. But, it gets old really fast over time as your progress through the same order of business over and over again.  Not only does this get boring after this, but, the team play does not work with the gameplay if the team does not play like a team. It pains me to say it, but, some players can kill the experience and really mess things up for the others enjoying the game. It doesn't work all the time and, unfortunately, games like these could become rather stale without friends who know what they're actually doing during a mission.  Also, what catches my eye is the lack of effort in terms of trying to push the genre further, regardless of if they actually wanted to or not. Gunplay, when ammo is available, is sort of satisfying, only when gunning down a horde of zombies with an M-16 is actually possible. Melee combat gets bloody, which is AWESOME, but suffers from very stressful moments where influence by your teammates can affect a good melee between you and a handful of zombies begging to be whacked. You get tired way too easily, which kills immersion when in fact in some situations you can do more than what you might expect of a regular average joe in a similar situation. The game loses immersion this way and really makes players a lot more vulnerable than planned in terms of gameplay mechanics.  Also what is puzzling is also the lack of diverse missions with very different objectives. For example, almost every single Point A to Point B map, there is always one objective that pertains unlocking various amounts of doors. I expected something more than that from a game that is a lot more immersive than Left-4-Dead. Other objectives require retrieving items and fuel, grabbing keys, clearing exits, etc. It gets repetitive a lot and I find myself turned off by the repetitve nature of its escape game mode. But, there is a Survival game mode and that even gets stressful. What the creators didn't account for was the lack of proper teamplay that a small number of the player base display. I found myself always getting the scraps of supplies after many of my teammates bum rushed me and left me alone to fend for myself while everyone partied with shotgun shells, assault rifle rounds, and knives. I know, I should've left first, but, the moment that you hear that a supply drop arrives, you may not even get something worth the horrible trek from where you were, which could be on the OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP, or even just right next to the adjacent room where the drop arrives.  Also, in this lack of effort argument is the lack of characters to choose. I have many female friends who have been turned off by this section only because of this, which, seems small, but, it isn't. I know they work so hard on this game, but the character selection in this game is severly limited. It ruins the immersion in the game, since it prevents players from completely immersing themselves in the universe of NMRiH. Immersion was the goal here and character customization sort of dropped its points.   This game is fun when it can be. It can be intense, it can be scary and it sure can be addictive, but, when the other players allow it to or when the flawed game mechanics, repetitive play, sort-of drowned out immersion, or the lack of unique modes of play begin to show itself. I love this game, I really do, but, this game's flaws, mechanics, and lack of complete immersion take so many points from it where I can only recommend it to hardcore zombie gamers, zombie fans, or horror FPS fans. Sorry NMRiH, I have to say that I was disappointed, but, at least entertained.  64/100",

You will find that you start with a decent supply of ammo, but you soon will use it all on zombies, making ammo harder and harder to find. And that's just if you can find the right weapon for it.

Pros -Realistic gunplay -Makes you nervous or uncomfortable thanks to the dreadful music and tone -Makes you desperate to find medkits or bandages, or even pills to keep you alive and not infected -Zombies are DEADLY, one bit and you're gone, unless you find pills which are rare. -Ever wanted to be freaked out by little kid zombies? or even running zombies? This is the game -Dev is active  Cons -No story whatsoever, it only shows a fraction of a story by the loading menu cutscenes -Textures are a bit....strange. The cars appear to be made by hand, either to avoid copyright bs or again, crafted by hand. -No FOV changing, 60 fov at all times.  8/10 could be better.",

This game is about Co-op, helping each other, not to kill each other.  Limited ammo, variety of maps, lots of objective and guns, Hand-to-Bite Combat, custom server modification (Like unlimited ammo or unlimited supplies), it's the best.  The other thing is when our friend got infected, it made us hesitated. It will let us choose two ways, first shoot him in the face, second is give them pills. 10/10 shot them in their face. [ME TOO.]  The last one is game system. It look real the most in any zombie games. We can choose the characters and their sound, it made our characters not all same like infestation. In-game system has made out really cool. We don't always need to choose melee weapons to fight hand-to-hand fight with them, cause some guns have 'Bayonet' to fight with or we just press 'V' to push them back and shoot them in the face.   Pros 1. Free 2. Limited ammo 3. Customized server 4. Lots of objective 5. Weapons 6. Realistic motion (Characters &amp; Zombies) 7. Real-life apocalypse  8. Lots of characters and sounds 9. Great BGM and sound effect 10. Fantastic game system  11. Lots of maps 12. Weapons-Ammo checking (It doesn't show us while we are shooting.) 13. Lots of gamemodes 14. Enable cheats {some servers} (press Y and type !guns)  Cons 1. Server sometimes it doesn't keep in history. 2. Tired so damm fast!!!!  100/10 of players who started to play first time would continue playing forever.",

Logical and there's always hordes of them giving very little time to catch your breath.

Always wasting their ammo, getting themselves killed, killing zombies that are not even in the way (You're not even supposed to kill all of them unless it's a survival map. BTW, anyone willing to try doing a pacifist run on every single escape map? Would watch your run if you recorded it.), not sharing ammo if they have extra ammo they don't have a gun for, never helping teammates if they are nearly dead etc.  And of course, infinite ammo servers.

This does not play anything like Left 4 Dead. Gameplay is not as fast paced, but definitely just as intense. One scratch or bite from a zombie has a chance of infecting you and guns and ammunition are scarce.  Probably the closest thing to a hardcore zombie experience out there. The lobby system is a bit cluttered and messy, but hopefully with further updates they'll fix all the glitches and continue improving the experience. It is a Half-Life 2 mod, after all, but I think it's safe to say that they successfully seperated their mod from its source and created their own unique game.  It's free, so it's definitely at least worth a shot.",

Unlike other zombie games were you probably start off with a large gun and start shooting zombies with a ton of ammo, in this game ammo is limited so you'll often use melee weapons, which is actully a real case scenario if there is a zombie apocolypse in real life. This is also the only zombie game where I have seen that when you get bit you actully become infected and over time no matter what your health is you will die and turn into a zombie. The only thing I disliked about the game is that if you have enough experience in the game and join a team of new players, it ruins the fun since they are new with the game and dont know how to play or what the objective is which just leaves you by yourself with no back up. You know a noob when you see a noob in the game, to any of the people who are reading this and have played the game for quite some time, you probably seen what noobs do in the following, 1. They take all the ammo for themselves 2.When caught by a zombie they attack rather than shove 3. They dont defend the zones in survival mode. I always encounter this numerous times while playing the game. However I always like it when there are international people on the server and chat in their laungage by the chat box or mic, to me it's always fun to hear it and see it despite not knowing what they're saying. This game features only one thing: Realistic zombie apocolyptic experience. I highly highly recommend this to anyone who wants the real deal of a zombie survival game.

            "review_text": "Being a fan of hard games I was excited to see there's a F2P game that focuses on cautiousness rather than a quick triggerfinger. On top of that there aren't any ingame cash transactions so there's no 'pay 2 win' either. It seems that the developers keep in touch with the community, which is always nice. According to the shop site there are still lots of content to be added in the future.  The game's graphics aren't the best but being an ascended mod running on the Source engine I guess that's not too big a deal. It also has little to no impact on the gameplay and atmosphere.  The sounds on the other hand are quite nice. You get your typical shooter acustics- footsteps, gun sounds, melee smacks, zombie groans, but the soundtrack is where the game's audio really shines. There are lots of different pieces (in style of soundtracks like The Walking Dead's and State of Decay's) that play according to the current situation in the game.   The game's atmosphere is awesome. In contrast to L4D's cannon fodder zombies, the undead in NMRIH are a true menace. Even a single zed can take down an uncautious player in a few hits and bites. This level of difficulty manages to deliver a constant feeling of threat, something I missed in (the flawed but great) State of Decay, to name a current example (especially thanks to the OP cars in that game). From frantically running around, dodging zombies left and right while trying to fulfill the map's final task, to carefully sneaking around in a mansion or theater, covering each other while scrounging for ammo or medicine- the game manages to present an  atmosphere that's worthy of being called 'survival horror' (something that's become rare in today's horror games).  NMRIH tries to abstain from using a HUD. There's no health and stamina meter, so the player has to keep an eye on the character's heartbeat, breathing and vision. The amounts of ammo in your gun are only shown when the player takes the time to actually check the magazine. This might seem a bit overwhelming or confusing at first but it surely adds to the atmosphere. Something that took a bit of getting used to is the handling of the melee weapons. In my first few matches I found myself constantly missing the zeds right in front of me, leaving my char open to be grappled and overwhelmed. There's no real sense of 'depth', if you will, to the melee attacks, which means that the player has to learn about the actual ranges of his weapons. A few hours later I can say that I know my favourite weapons and I know how to use them (without the game actually becoming too easy), although there are some other weapons I don't like to choose because they just suck in my opinion- but that's not an issue of the game itself.  All in all I just can say: Grab a friend, download this gem, go out there and survive! Seriously, even if you find yourself not liking this game, at least give it a chance. It'll cost you nothing but a bit of time. Having a friend to play with and to actually communicate with while playing helps a lot (as always)- because someone you can depend on is always nice to have in case the world ends ;)",

Beginning with the cons: - Manually searching for a server can be a pain - Joining can often lead to waiting until the next round (takes a long time) - Server issues (though its often the people's fault not this game) - Hit detection with melee weapons seem a bit off  Now with the pros (and there's plenty): + Getting infected, this is actually pretty awesome and new to this type of genre of games (surprisingly) + Graphics are pretty good for a half-life 2 mod + Child zombies (finally someone with guts) + Realistic survival (not much ammo, so a lot of scavenging) + ONLY ONE LIFE, this looks like it should be in cons but quite the contrary considering that if a player ends up dying, they'll have to wait until the next round so make that one life count  That's pretty much the basic things. There's more packed into the game itself. One last thing to say is, unfortunately this is one of those games where you have to download and play it yourself. While this 'review' highlights the good and the bad, the game is a bit lacking. I recommend this, yes but is it worth playing over and over until your eyes melt and you have carpel tunnel....well play it and see if its your cup of tea.",

Luckily, this is a modding community so many maps are available to download and most (and I say most) maps present new objective/survival based maps. The jist of it is this, if you like zombie games get it. If not, don't. Everyone knows about the infamy of constant zombie games released so if you don't like zombie games and think they are going to get boring than don't get this game.

You can also use a flashlight with any one handed weapon system. Stay away from lower caliber guns like 9mm and 22lr; they take 2 headshots to kill. Also dont waste ammo on lone zombies, melee them with a decent reach weapon.",

Features a great selection of weapons and constant additions to the current arsenal from the Dev's. Also features visceral melee combat that with the right timing can have a big impact against your enemies.  A negative point (if you find this point to be a negative) about this mod is that if your looking for a game with action set pieces and Call of Duty-esque action your looking in the wrong place as this mod aims for a realism aesthetic .Generally great rounded zombie wave survival.",

Also, some how, a f*cking CHILD ZOMBIE can take at least 3 hits from a sledge hammer before going down, BECAUSE THAT MAKES SENSE. The zombies can kill you really easily and even if they don't, you'll bleed out and die. Try playing this game on your own, and YOU'RE F*CKED (I wasn't playing on my own, I was with three other people). If more than one zombie grabs you, and you have no one to help you, you're going to die. The huge crowds just make the game unfair because they can also take more than one head shot before dying, the amount of ammo you have is pretty scarce so take your shots wisely (clearly they didn't when making this game). So in short, this game's a piece of sh*t, and thank god it's free to play so you're not wasting money. F*CK THIS GAME.",

You and any other survivors you may be with have to constantly watch your backs, keep a gun - and crowbar - handy at all times, and be ready to switch from flashlight to rifle in a split second. However on the downside, the game could use some improvments. I never liked how Left 4 Dead looked, it was too 'common'. This game looks a lot like it and if not that - exactly like it. Another matter is the ammo deal. I can't tell what ammo goes with what gun, and that's a problem when you're running, gunning and scavenging. My final concern is that this game could be better with less 'pick a person and get thrown into the fray' gameplay and more immersive gameplay. It needs a character creation, the ability to name your character and some sort of level format.   Aside from the entire game, this would make an absolutley awesome free-roam apocalypse game.  ",

There is no payment model in this stand-alone Half-Life 2 mod even though after playing for dozens of hours, I think it deserves some monetary compensation. So what is the game about and why do I recommend it?  Well for starters the atmosphere is both gripping and exciting - trying to navigate your away through dark city streets dimly lit by burning car wrecks and the countless hordes of the undead forces the players on their heels. The game's varied soundscape, which includes such noises as the skull-splitting crack of a zombie's head from a powerful swing by fire axe, to the grumble and gurgles of nearby zombies that have yet to detect you... and from the frightened voices of teammates heard through fully-integrated in-game voice chat, to their cries for you to help them as they are mercilessly being eaten alive. The range of emotions and claustrophobia tense the player, eliciting such panic and fight-or-flight response that it may put you in danger, and cost both you and potentially others their lives.   This isn't just a concern of running and gunning - which it sometimes can be - if you have enough ammunition and want to move at a faster pace, or are at risk of being completely surrounded and devoured by the shambling masses of rotting flesh... But above all the shooting and gore, this game's also about methodical teamwork and calculated risks that serve to not frustratingly overwhelm the player, but to deepen their immersion and enrich the scope of the game into a wider breadth of enjoyment and quick-thinking.  Each element working in tandem with the next - brings both the individual player, and team together as a cohesive whole into confrontation with a vast array of challenges and threats to overcome. There's so much fun and excitement to experience in this - let me emphasize one more time - FREE GAME, that it takes a few deep breaths at the end of a successful (or perhaps unsuccessful) mission to collect one's thoughts and comprehend what in the hell just happened!   Even after playing one of the many multitudes of varied maps and gametypes - which will keep you busy and entertained dozens of play-throughs each, you will inevitably run into something new and unexpected that will give you cause for hiding in a well-lit corner to reload, rethink, and take on the masses of walkers (and some sprinters) yet again, even while bleeding profusely, or slowly losing consciousness to infection, hoping - wishing - you find the necessary medication somewhere along your travels just in time before turning into one of those... things.   The developers in my mind have literally given the PC-gaming community a gift... by both making this game, while also making it free for us all to enjoy together. Masterfully crafted and downright scary, forcing one to be quick-thinking and quick on their feet, using both teamwork and individual contribution to the misson's goals, this free stand-alone zombie survival mod, that took 7 YEARS to create is worth every second, and every penny... if pennies were involved.  Try. This. Out. Highly recommended!",

It is also easier to pronounce the two syllables Nim-Reh rather than the entire game title. My Experience : Nmrih was one of the most adrenaline rushing zombie game I could play for free on steam (granted you have some form of Source Engine SDK files installed already). The concept of having limited ammo and the introduction of teamwork was new and exciting. Though it was very hard to get used to the game at first, a few rounds of the game should help you ease into the playstyle. This isn't a shoot-em-up zombie survival game. This is a holding-onto-dear-life sort of gameplay. Guns and weapons are hard to scavenge, and the zombies can easily swarm the whole team, even though 80% of the zombies can only limp. The other 20% are runners, they run like marathon runners and you do not want to be near them unless you have a surefire shot with a gun or hit with a melee weapon on its head. I don't want to spoil the gameplay too much, so the rest of the game features can be yours to discover. Pros: -Plenty of maps and custom maps -Has survival mode and objective mode -FREE (if you have the source files) -Great co-op game -Still in development Cons: -Still in development (I repeated this because when a game is in development, it has things to be worked on, but it also means that the game's dev team isn't dead) -Hitboxes can be pretty weird (when the zombies change directions, their heads jerk too fast for the player to catch up with) -Doesn't give me free Cake for my birthday  That is the overall review of the game, I would highly recommend you get this game, so click That Green Button below to download now!

Even though the graphics are not 10/10 quality, that doesn't matter because that's what makes the game more enjoyable. Old school graphics. Then of course their is the weapons/items you can use.

(although it's not the best game out there but one of the funnest games to play with your mates) -Plenty of people still play this games! -Easy to adjust into the gameplay mechanics. -Learn teamwork (or maybe not if you find the right people to play with :P)  -Simple gameplay yet interesting, did I forget to mention there's not much hackers here?  Cons: -Although it's free there are some glitchy zombies, it's not as bad as DAYZ zombies. -It can get frustrating sometimes when it comes to finding a game where everyone is playing (you'll spectate until the person dies or reach a check point then you can start to play. which it's kind of like FOREVER!!!)

At frst glance the whole interface seems very confusing, but believe me... After a few hours you begin to realise the great potential this game has. Over the years, shooting zombies became mainstream. I mean really? You pick up a gun and fight through the horde on your own. This game manages to achieve something different. It's extremely unsettling and disturbing in a strange and unique way. I've been lanning this with my brother lately, and halfway through the missions you start getting a very strange feeling. It draws you in so well that you end up feeling like it really is a situation of life or death. Also, the maps are extremely difficult to clear, and once you get through one objective map, it feels GREAT! The sense of achievement is absolutely overwhelming and the joy of escaping with someone you know is brilliant! Beating a map will not only require practice and skill, but cooperation too. This is probably what stands out the most in NMRIH. You can go on and about grabbing all the weapons etc but believe me, you won't make it out alive on your own. It's about time we stop mindlessly gunning through hordes and use tactics as well as teamwork to progress through a game.  Thanks to the developers for creating a masterpiece.",

You could reskin the zombies with something cute and kawaii and it would still be fun to hack away at it.  But until I get some more friends into a private lobby I'd pass if I were you. Playing solo, or online public, didnt really teach me anything except how to tell people how many bullets I have left. Also, I doubt anyone has a system as lowend as mine anymore, but this game wouldnt run constant 30fps with shadows on. If you have the nvidia shadow issue with source engine games, its going to be ten times worse with this one because for some reason the shadows seem to extend across the limbs of enemies, making the game nearly unplayable without running 'r_shadows_gamecontrol 0'",

The undead in this game make each lone player seem underpowered as they can surround you and make you helpless. Zombies come in massive hordes and are difficult to kill unless you aim for the head. But as a team, you are more likely to survive a horde of the undead.  Ammo and bullet weapons are scarce but not to the point of never finding them. Each weapon has its own unique and very nice texture and model. And to make the survival expierence even more fun and difficult each weapons has its own size and weight. So you have to watch your inventory space.  Overall, this game is great for teamplayers, zombie killers, and people who want to have a fun time with friends (or enemies) And best of all, theres no pay to win.",

            "review_text": "  No More Room in Hell  is a cooperatvie zombie survival game that makes you tense and makes sure you don't get too confident.    NMRiH  is also very slow-paced. Guns aren't abundant, and you might not even find a very good gun. Ammo is also incredibly scarce, and when you do find ammo, it's usually for a different gun than the one you have.  Healing/medical items are also very scarce, which is a huge problem when your character is bleeding/infected.  Zombies are mostly slow, but they're quite resilient and won't go down unless you attack their head. On top of that, only certain melee weapons are capable of one shot kills. So much as a single zombie can be threatening sometimes.  As I mentioned earlier, it's possible for your character to become infected; this sometimes happens when a zombie grabs you. When your character becomes infected, the infection will gradually worsen until it kills you. The infection can be held off by consuming pills; but doing so only buys you some extra time, and the infection will eventually come back. And don't forget what I said earlier about medical items being scarce.  The worst part about dying from infection (or just getting killed by a zombie while you're infected), is that your character will then turn into a zombie that is stronger, faster, and more aggressive than the standard zombies. This isn't really your problem (other than the part where you die), but your teammates will have to deal with zombified you (and like I said, zombie you is more dangerous than a normal zombie). If you don't want to turn (or don't want a friend to turn) and nobody has any pills, zombification can be prevented if an infected player is killed by another player. Speaking of which, friendly fire only applies to infected players by default; so if somebody says they're not infected but you think they're lying, you can just swing at them with your melee weapon and see if they take damage (I don't really recommend this, since some servers have friendly fire on at all times).  There are two main gamemodes: survival and objective. Survival maps require you to maintain control of certain areas of the map, with supplies being airdropped to you occasionaly so that you have a fighting chance. Objective maps are kind of like left 4 dead; get from the start of the map to the end with the occasional objective showing up that you have to complete to progress.  And something about it makes it so much  fun.  A crowd of zombies is difficult enogh that clearing a hallway of just 5 or 6 zombies almost feels like an accomplishment by itself. The difficulty makes completing a map really  feel  like escaping. You get more of a 'yeah, it's finally over!' feeling than a 'screw that map' feeling (unless the map sucks, but that's the map's fault).   TL;DR   NMRiH  is slow and difficult, but in a good way that makes everything strangely satisfying. You just gotta be patient.  Also, it's not that bad of a thing to kill a teammate that's hoarding everything.",

            "review_text": "Very gritty and realistic in terms of Z-appocolypse scenarios. This aint no Dead Rising, Dead Island or Left 4 Dead, kiddies, it is like George Romero with a slight twist. This time, you aim for the head ONLY (Anywhere else, you're wasting ammo) and be careful with various guns like automatics (Which are all sub-machine guns) and 'nades (Which includes, C4, molotovs, frags and dynamite). Know the ammo for your guns as you cannot pick up any random ammo box and it somehow turns into the right caliber or ammo type, the human vultures (Which are likely to be kids or trolls) always do this by picking up everything and filling up their inventory.  Speaking of the inventory system, it's really well made as it is limited by the size of the item. This really lets you look at your priorities as you don't have some magical way to store ALL your weapons and supplies on your person like in any other game. Ammo is also quite limited and is almost always jsut a luxury depending on the server (There are some servers with infinite ammo), map, and player's skill, so a good tip is to get a melee weapon of some kind, I prefer something with a long handle if you can find it like a sledge or fire axe and time your strikes right. So, don't just get guns because if you run out of ammo, you're screwed in more ways than one as the Zeds close in to horrificly rip you to shreds. BTW the only gun you can successfully kill zombies with a melee strike is one with a bayonett (I don't remember the name of the gun) and it's not a custom attachment. Also, protip, if youre infected and still fighting, I prefer you do the sensible thing (after actually telling everyone) and save the last bullet for yourself cuz, first timers get a cheevo.  Weapons have had a nice attention to detail as you actually need specific calibers, like the Ruger needs .22 LR and the m16 (Which has been permenately set to semi auto in this game) needs 5.56 ammunition. This also throws in unconventional weapons like the very tools you carry as you do missions, you could try to brain a zombie with your flashlight or welder. Watch out for fire weapons and molotovs as well as fire could turn all walking zombies into burning runners until they literally burn out so either run for your life or actually shoot bullets to finish it off. The operation and kick of each gun shows the devs really did their homework and probably made a few trips to a shooting range. The revolvers, after each shot, you can see the player model's thumb pull the hammer back. The shotgun's reload animation is nice as well as the player adds one more shot into the chamber making that one extra shot a bit more of a difference between life and death. The ammo hud is also a good attention to detail as it would fade away until you hold the reload button (R) to take a look at the ammo you have left as your character calls out how much he has left telling the other players to support you when they can.  Survival in general is a huge thing to look at. For example, if you're attacked by a zed there's more or less a 50/50 chance you are bitten which is garunteed to infect you even more when grabbed (so push them off with V to keep you from getting any more damage). As the infection spreads through your body, veiny paterns appear on your screen and your sight starts to darken. So your options are to either ask to be put down, find some phalanx, shooting yourself, or simply die while fighting the zeds off (Looking at other reviews, you'll see stories of people just being d**ks and not telling anyone so they can turn and just ruin lives). I highly recommend playing this with friends than strangers due to trust and communication issues that will plague public online games. If in a team, KEEP TOGETHER and dont lag behind, as in any zombie appocalypse scenarios (as shown in movies) Survivors have a better chance to survive with more people in their group. Adding to that, watch each other's back as you could be attacked from behind out of nowhere, especially in objective game modes (Survival game modes depend on how well you know the map and the layout of the map istelf).   Now onto the real stars, other than your fellow survivors, the zombies. The devs really did well with the walking corpses adding not only male and female zombies, but children and runners as well. Being surrounded by them makes the atmosphere pretty intense if you're on the run in objective mode or fiercely defending an objective in Survival mode. The children zombies are a bit of a pain to kill, not just that you're killing something that was just a sweet and innocent child in a previous life, but they are shorter and would force you to try to aim down. Runners are a bit of a problem but not as much as the children in my opinion, you just have to react fast and blast them on the face with your shotgun or pistol or let your buddies take them down. The zombie moans you hear are also a nice small detail the devs pay attention to as they have varying pitches and 'voice' like a child zombie's would be higher pitch and a bit more raspy same for a zombie woman's. It's also satisfying to see a Zed's head pop when you land a solid headshot.  I HIGHLY recommend this to anyone looking for a more genuine zombie game as this makes you feel like you're in a zombie movie struggling to survive with other survivors.",

One thing that I find really interesting is the fact that your character can become infected and turn into a zombie (you don't get to control the zombie) which will do a ton of disorientating damage to your old team. The game never lacks in excitement either, if i take you on a little trip down memory lane you might understand better. One of the first times i played the game i was with a friend, and we were clueless. To spare you the boring details i will just say this, the story ends with a blowtorch, a sewer, a phonebooth, and lots of gernades.

There are survival maps and objective maps in the game, survival maps is where you survive wave after wave of zombies, and objective maps is where you will have to complete set of objectives until you get to the end and successfully escape the zombie infested map. Most of the time you'll be using melee weapons to defend yourself since guns and ammo are scarce, along with other resources such as medkits and bandages for when you're injured, you'll truly succumb to fear in this game and you'll be fighting for your life to survive. :)",

He shares everything and is willing to put you first. Bad side is, most of the time he's gonna get killed because he has no weapons. Or medicine. He gave it all to you.  Bad Foreigner: I can't understand you. So stop blocking door ways and start killing zombies, not teammates. I seriously don't get these people.  Good Foreigner: nothing necessarily wrong with them, I just can't understand them, which could end badly.  Competent: Will share, cover, help, everything. Also doesn't die a lot.  Rager: like the competent, but WAY too competetive. If they die, they're done. And they're gonna tell you how done they are, and then leave.   I\\'m almost a competent. But I'm a noob so I still die.

This is a good game if I want to just have something hard to play and the people complaining about character Speed, Reloading, Lack of ammo etc are just people who are too dumb. I also found a guy in the negative section who said that kid zombies are too creepy, There isn't enough ammo, and that zombies are impossible to get off once they grab you even though you can shove zombies away by pressing V. The guy also said he disliked runners. Also Another guy said that they couldnt play on a map for more than 20 minutes.... To fix go change the map time from 20 to 99999999999999999.  Pros: Source Engine = Physics. Reloading Takes as long as realism gets. No Special Infected. 'Creepy' Kid Zombies (Its supposed to be creepy... Its a 'Zombie' Game). No Infinite Ammo (Except for the bloody Infinite Ammo Servers). Create A private server with [insert peer to peer software of choice].  Cons: Hoarders Majority of people dislike Lack of Ammo. People saying they should 'Handle It'. Extremely Stupid or unwilling to help community players.",

            "review_text": "I don't write reviews often, but I gotta say this game is one of the best games around for those looking for zombie action. Here are both pros and cons of the game:  Pros: - Unique Combat (Gunplay and melee combat is unique compared to other games, being slower, heavier and more deliberate) - Objective based gameplay (As opposed to being put in a world to roam around with no clear objective, gameplay is linear with a clear objective and goal) - Well designed maps (Each map is unique with its own gimmick, be it a sewer level or using trains) - Team based gameplay (Adds to the sense of realism, in that in a zombie apocalypse you can't survive on your own) - Great atmosphere (All the maps feel eerie, zombies are still creepy, the possibility of infection keeps you on edge) - Damage Spread (Reduces consisteny of attacks, so not every power attack will be a one hit kill, keeps you on your toes) - Non-artifical scarcity (Rather than just artifical scarcity, weapons are where you expect them but not plentiful. Dead survivors may have a pistol, gun shops have a large display of rifles, rust belt cabins have a large containment of revolvers and shotguns etc.) - Maximum accessibility (Minimum PC requirements, game is free, allows anyone to pick it up)  This in turn makes a really unique zombie shooter game, which seems fairly simple and easy, given the shuffling nature of most zombies, but when times least expect it can become one of the hardest games around!  Cons: - Game relies heavily on communication (Lack of friends to talk with can seriously impede your chances of survival) - Scarcity is not proportional to number of players (When there is a full server, it can often lead to situations where only a few survivors have weapons and the rest are with melee) - Barricading isn't useful (Zombies won't be detered around to another spot, and you cannot use melee weapons to poke through the slits. The only way to hurt other zombies is to destroy the barricades themselves) - The wave based survival mode isn't the most fun (Maps aren't balanced in terms of weapons, with some maps being much easier than others. The designated safe zones are arbitrary, survivors can't choose where they stage their HQ). - A common plugin in servers is infinite ammo which totally detracts from the game itself - Maps are sometimes too linear. Maps should have 2/3 ways of moving towards a goal rather than through one corridor which they must fight through  Overall, this is one of my favourite games around, and given that it is free, it really allows anyone to pick it up!  A unique game that no other game quite offers. 8/10",
