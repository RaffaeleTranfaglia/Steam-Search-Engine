            "review_text": "VVVVVV is one of the best games I've played in recent times &amp; I would not hesitate to call it 2010's Game Of The Year ahead of Red Dead Redemption &amp; Super Meat Boy. The gameplay revolves around the simple mechanic of the jump button in a retro platformer inverting gravity instead of jumping. This alone already makes for some very original &amp; interesting puzzles, however the game doesn't stop there. The level design, in a Half-Life 2 way, introduces new gameplay mechanics every so often, many of which is only featured in the segment that it was introduced in. This provides lots of variety to the platforming while constantly challenging the player in new ways. Mix that with awesome music &amp; Atari-style art direction &amp; you've got a slam dunk in game design. The game is of an appropriate length for it, clocking in at 2-3 hours for the main story mode, however there are custom levels you can play as well. The story is good, well delivered &amp; actually has a fair layer of depth to it. The information nodes scattered around the game world provide some insight to the nature of the incident. It isn't as deep as Half-Life or F.E.A.R. but that's okay since VVVVVV is a 2-3 hour retro platformer where that kind of stuff isn't expected, not an first-person action game. The only flaw would be the hyper-sensitive controls, though they are more consistent than something like Super Meat Boy, so mastering them is easier. VVVVVV sets a new standard for not only 2d platformers or indie games but video games in general.",

            "review_text": "There are really two types of people in this world. Those who hate maddeningly frustrating twitch platformers like this one, and those who hate maddeningly frustrating twitch platformers like this one so much, they can't stop playing them. Spiritual elder sibling to 'You Have To Win The Game,' VVVVVV is to the Commodore 64 platformer of yore what its CGA cousin is to the DOS platformer of yore, and I cannot possibly recommend both games enough.   To paraphrase the words that prefaced the Dungeons and Dragons rulebook so many years ago, those gamers who lack patience, those who don't care for Monty Mole's adventures through sprawling maps of tricky-to-navigate rooms, who feel no thrill upon waking up with Lester in the suspended cage in that famously Another World, who do not enjoy rubbing their palmheel raw on the molded plastic grip of an old one-button joystick with a nine-pin connector or trying hundreds of times to see what lies beyond that maddening gauntlet of hazards, even if it's just a blank room that hasn't been visited before, will not be likely to find VVVVVV to their tastes. But those whose curiosity knows no bounds and whose frustration tolerance rivals that of a Zen master will find this game the answer to their SID-soundtracked, load-star-comma-eight-comma-one prayers.   The very simple graphics may put you off; don't let them. The six Vs of the title, the cast of the game, take a little getting-used-to, certainly, and I admit, I would have liked a slightly less stylized (if still period-appropriate) character model, but their simple Carcassone-like iconic cuteness grows on you, or at least a tolerance to it accumulates. The characters have two recognizable facial expressions, and their paddle-like, boxy heads are sized, I suspect, to accommodate those easily-recognizable expression changes. Without sharing spoilers, I should note that it becomes clear, later in the game, that their box-headed design was thematically intentional. If you don't like it, relax, and don't let that stop you from enjoying this amazing game.  The backgrounds, with their stylized metal plating, single-color enemies, and two-plane-deep parallax scrolling gamefield, will be immediately recognizable to C64 fans, as will the bombastic, cheerful, strident soundtrack of in-game looped hits by Magnus Pålsson. While You Have To Win The Game offers only monophonic sound cues, in line with its pre-soundcard DOS-and-PC-speaker pedigree, VVVVVV feels much less stark and empty for its consistently cheerful, upbeat and hopeful tone, and the soundtrack plays a huge role in creating that atmosphere of 'Let's play space explorers!' Saturday morning excitement.   Again, like its cousin, the massive, sprawling map is liberally dotted with continue points, which make recovering from one of the game's many nigh-inevitable deaths less painful, as little ground must be regained afterward. Like its cousin, exploration is key, and will be rewarded -- the map view offers a tantalizing glimpse of area not yet traveled, and the desire to wipe away all the blank areas on it is strong. Like its cousin, the game's locales can be revisited after winning, explored anew, and there's a reward in store for completionists. Like its cousin, spikes are an ever-present and vexing environmental hazard. Like its cousin, there are a few graphic options that help to recreate a much more obviously retro gaming platform experience. (I love Analogue Mode, though I wish there was a way to reduce the frequency of vertical hold failures, or to turn off vertical hold failures completely.)   So, you might be asking, how does VVVVVV differ from You Have To Win The Game? Quite significantly, despite their many similarities. First, the bombastic, upbeat optimism of the game is a stark contrast to YHTWTG's quiet and emptiness. There are no friends to be found in YHTWTG, while in VVVVVV, reuniting the titular Vs is, in fact, the primary goal of the game's main arc. (This is not a spoiler, for not; it's stated from the get-go.) Furthermore, while YHTWTG uses a fairly conventional run-and-jump platformer mechanic, there is no jump button in VVVVVV. Rather, the protagonist can reverse personal gravity, and elect to 'fall up' rather than down, more or less at will.  More or less, indeed. To flip gravity, one must first be standing on (at least momentarily) solid ground. A flip in progress must complete, and land successfully, before the player can flip again. Our brave Captain Viridian can steer mid-fall, but can't stop a fall. It is entirely possible to end up missing a safe landing point this way. Be grateful for those ubiquitous continue-points. You'll need them. At least, mercifully, one can't die from too long a fall.  I've already mentioned the difference in mood, but beyond this, VVVVVV is communicative in a way YHTWTG isn't. The landscape is dotted with computer terminals hosting messages, and of course, there are five crew members to find and rescue. While YHTWTG offers no clues about its landscape, VVVVVV tells a coherent narrative, and while many questions are left unanswered, one leaves VVVVVV with a better sense of the events of the game in a narrative context than the state in which one leaves YHTWTG.  VVVVVV offers some really spectacular accessibility features for gamers who would normally not be able to play this sort of game, too. One can slow down the game incrementally, turn off moving backgrounds and screen effects, or set the protagonist invincible. The granularity of slowdown control allows you to easily notch the game's reflexes-related difficulty back to a point where it's still challenging but playable, for those who can't react quickly enough at full game speed. This option, as opposed to simply implementing the invulnerability switch, shows a real solid understanding of not only what such a player might need, but how to provide it while preserving as much of the challenge of the game as said player wishes to face. It's rare that this much thought goes into accessibility accommodations, let alone in an indie game.   Finally, VVVVVV offers tools to build one's own levels and scenarios, to bundle them up, and to share them with others. There are quite a few fan-made levels out there, and they're often quite impressive. Terry Cavanagh offers a free 'Make and Play' edition of VVVVVV that creates and plays fan-made levels, allowing you to easily and legally share what you make with others. That feature alone extends VVVVVV far beyond the scope of YHTWTG, and makes it a real must-have at its $5 price point. (Frankly, it was more than worth its original $15 price point, too, but I'm glad the price dropped, and VVVVVV became a much more comfortable impulse buy for the still-unconvinced gamer.)  VVVVVV will frustrate you. It will vex you. It will make you scream in frustration and insist it's 'impossible' at least once or twice, but then you'll sail past a difficult level and the palpable joy of your triumph will eclipse the frustration. (Veni Vidi Vici, anyone...?) If your frustration tolerance is limited, this is probably not the game for you. If you can't get beyond the lo-fi visual style, if 'chiptunes' annoy you, if dying over and over again bothers you, and especially if you're not not a twitch-reflexes run-and-jumper (run-and-flipper?), then this is probably not your game.  You're probably either put off or curious now. I hope you're curious. VVVVVV rewards curiosity, as long as it's tempered with a healthy dose of patience. Jump in, flip gravity, and rock out the soundtrack. This is a fun, sunny, bombastic return to Saturday mornings on the Commodore 64, in all the very best of ways.",

            "review_text": "A Diamond in the Rough  During my first foray into the Steam sale over Christmas, a friend of mine alerted me to a game on sale for 50 cents. How could I say 'no' to that opporunity? I didn't care what it was. Much to my happiness, the game turned out to be quite fun and a lookback into the 1980s.  VVVVVV  is a 2010 flash game from developer Terry Cavanagh, known for his retro-style, 2D games.  The story of  VVVVVV  is easy to dismiss since the game's main feature is it's puzzle platforming gameplay rather than storytelling. You play Captain Viridian, commander of a science space vessel that gets caught in 'dimensional interference' forcing evacuation through a trans-dimensional portal. You quickly discover that your crew has been scattered across multiple dimensions and are tasked with their individual rescue.  Controls are very simplistic. If you were to rank a game's control complexity on a scale of 'Dive Kick' to 'Steel Battalion',  VVVVVV  would rank just above Dive Kick. Left and right directionals plus an action key are all there is. The most notable limitation is you cannot jump. Instead, the action key reverses your character's direction of gravity from the floor to the ceiling and vice versa. This, combined with the various puzzles of the different levels, defines the gameplay. You use your lone ability to traverse the map avoiding enemies and, most notably, the endless plethora of death spikes, the appearance of which one could argue contributes to the game's namesake (the game's title is actually named for the dimension your ship is stuck in).  The is no health meter and, thankfully, no limit to the number of lives, for you will be dying a lot. However, I surprisingly found myself not being at all frustrated with this for a few reasons. There's no death sequence; respawns are near instantaneous and checkpoints are rather frequent. Also, the simple joy I got from trying to figure out how to safely traverse a section using the unique controls deterred 'rage quitting' at least for me. There is a death counter in the pause menu if you like to see how many times you've died since starting the game.   The game is rather fast paced, but for those whose eyes have a terrible time keeping up, the game's speed can be dialed back. A time trial mode, no death run, and flipped mode are also unlockable for the truly hardcore.  Visuals are textbook Commodore 64 era. If you're a spoiled child of 3D visuals, bright bloom, and HDR lighting, you will find none of it here.  VVVVVV  is classic 8-bit, 2D display with nothing entirely special about it. It's a simple thowback to gaming days of yore. All characters are the same model, differentiated by solid color alone, with only two facial expressions (happy and sad) while legs move about a pixel width back and forth during movement. Enemies appear in forms ranging from squares of garbaled mess to seemingly arbitrary words and numbers flying across the screen.   I was instantly in love with the soundtrack scored by chiptune artist Magnus Palsson. The tunes are incredibly catchy, upbeat, triumphant at times, and you'll find yourself having many of the songs stuck in your head for days on end. If I wasn't too into the game itself, I'd play the game simply for it's scoring. I wouldn't put it past myself to turning the game on and pausing it at a certain level just to listen to the music although that's easily accomplised by YouTube. The songs are also available for purchase through the composer's website.    VVVVVV  is a great puzzle platformer anyone is sure to enjoy. The programming is solid and simple. I never came across a single glitch. System requirements are not worth mentioning as any 10-year-old PC could probably handle this game. Nothing hampered my enjoyment short of dying 100 times on one obstacle. Your patience will be tested, your eyes will work a little harder, and your ears will be singing praises. Check out  VVVVVV  on Steam and Nintendo 3DS. An iOS, Android, Ouya, and PS Vita release are slated for 2014.",

Although you will die a multitude of times because of the game's difficulty, the lack of punishment for dying makes it fun to keep trying and trying, and provides a feeling of success when you finally beat a stage.",

While the game sticks to the mechanic of 'run around and flip gravity to get through areas' it changes the rules or environment in each of the areas in a way that keeps it interesting. Except for the 'escort quest' spots that make up about 2 to 10 minutes of your time (depending on skill) I found the whole thing enjoyable. Final level's rough, and some of the shiny trinkets are asking too much, but they're not necessary.  So yeah, worth the hour or two it will ask of you. Also a good candidate for speedrunning, if that's your thing!",

The game tests your patience, so if you don't like games like Super Meat Boy or The Binding of Isaac then this game isn't your type of game. However, if you like a little challenge in your life, then pick this game up. It has catchy chiptune music, a decent story, and a fun world to explore. It gets a 7/10 from me.",

To combat the short play through, VVVVVV has some tricks up it's sleeves. You will unlock Time Trials of stages you've completed, be able to return to the intermission levels, you can scower the world for all twenty trinkets, and even play the full game over with the entire world flipped upside down, which for some reason makes it more difficult.

However, due to very good placement of save-points VVVVVV is not as severly punishing as those games, by which it was obviously inspired. The storyline is not really important and does not add anything to the game. The graphics do the trick of making the game look really old-school and reminding me of many games I played in the past. I would by no means call them 'spectacular', though. Overall the game gives you a good experience, which is fun, sometimes frustrating, but still makes you feel proud of yourself for accomplishing the obstacles without becoming excessively enraging.",

A simple gravity inversion mechanic ('down' is whichever direction you're falling in) really changes things up though, and as you explore your surroundings the puzzles get steadily more challenging and engrossing.

It's a good game because in spite of the simplicity, it's great fun to play with amazing depth in the challenges presented.  Graphically, though very simple, are very lively and well presented. Yes, it may be primitive but it does work.  The music is also bloody awesome. Raw chip tune which sounds like it uses the Commodore 64 chip set. Makes the game feel very authentic which I personally love.  Another thing I like about the game is unlike many games that use 8-bit styling, this one looks like it might have actually be possible to make on a C64. I'm curious if it could fit on a tape but functionally, this does look pretty authentic.  Does it have a negative? Eh, questionable ones. The story is total rubbish, which fits in well with the overwhelming vast majority of retro games, let alone Commodore games and honesly, I don't see it as a negative because the story doesn't get in the way of my gaming. But some could find issue with it.  It's a damn hard game, but very doable with some persistence. Some, again, may find this off putting but I didn't. Compared to many retro games this is actually very forgiving.  It's also less than 4 quid. Take a chance on it.",

I grew up with platformer and I love them from Super Mario Bros. (NES) to Rayman Legends, but I can easily say that this genre has a little problem. After you master the basis of them every game is a lot easier and therefore after years they are not challenging anymore.  VVVVVV throws all of this out of the window! The gameplay itself is not the usual one you find in a platformer, you don't jump, you don't run, you don't have enemies to kick or stomp. It's a mix between platforming and survival games, you have just three actions, a huge map to explore and full of secrets and a lot of things in the game that just want to kill you by.... doing absolutely nothing than walking static paths.  This game shows how an extremely innovative and challenging game can be created by incredibly simple ideas.",

At least most of the time.  #4 Safety dance!  #5 Haveing a bunch of teleporters all over the place makes going where you want to go soooo much easier   And now for the cons:  #1 There is a giant flashing rainbow elephant. Avoid if you are epileptic.  And that's about it. 9/10! Great gameplay, amazing soundtrack, but hates epileptic people.

            "review_text": "VVVVVV (Steam) (Humble) strips away all the superfluous stuff that fills our games and boils platforming down to a single question: Are you good enough?  Your spaceship has been stranded in a strange dimension and your crew has become separated. As Captain Viridian, you must find them and figure out how to escape! This looks like a standard platformer at first, but there is one key twist: you can’t jump. Your only way to get over (or under) obstacles is to reverse gravity and walk on the ceiling. The way this game utilizes this conceit is masterful, and also evil. This game is extremely difficult.  The world is “open” in a sense, you can attack any of the five main challenge courses in any order you find them. Each course has an interesting twist on the very basic formula. One level is full of beams that reverse gravity when you touch them. On another, the screen wraps around itself selectively, making mazes of simple-seeming screens. There are some secret collectables scattered around in hard-to-reach places, but they are completely optional.  You will die a lot in this game. A LOT. I beat the game in a little under two hours, and I died 779 times. A majority of those deaths occurred in the infamous Veni Vidi Vici (Doing Things The Hard Way) level. This single challenge encapsulates what makes this game so great. Death is temporary in VVVVVV, lasting less than a second before you respawn at the last checkpoint to try again. Checkpoints are plentiful, never more than a few seconds away. This makes failure almost painless, and allows for some fiendishly difficult rooms that you will try to navigate over and over again. You won’t measure your own progress in stages completed or items collected. No, you’ll become astutely aware of how many PIXELS further you went on that last run. And you’ll yearn to get just one dot further on the next.  The retro aesthetic to VVVVVV is not unique by any means, but it is charming. Simple, bright colors, a pounding and pulsing chiptune soundtrack, and adorable characters make this one stand out amongst the 8-bit crowd. Viridian and his mates have only two facial expressions, but they are so genuine and funny. Terry Cavanaugh did an amazing job taking a single mechanic (gravity reversal) and building an entire game around it. The rules are simple, but the play space built on top of them is enormous and satisfying. I wouldn’t hesitate to call it one of the greatest games of all time, simply for its masterful design. VVVVVV is one of the best games to really exploit Flow State where you become so focused on the task at hand through sheer repetition and muscle memory, that you gain expertise in the task without even realizing it. I love this sentence from Chris Breault’s discussion of VVVVVV: “For all the posturing by elitists in the gaming community, there’s no skill to games but patience.”  VVVVVV is not for everybody. If you’re easily frustrated or don’t want your games to stress you out, then avoid this one. But if you are able to reach the flow state and rise above the challenges presented, you will experience the most euphoric feeling of victory in gaming.",

The list is arranged by difficulty, and each level provides a different plot that changes the perspective of the main character and the atmosphere in general.   also, if you are lazy, there's an option to pay to unlock everything, but you wouldn't do that, right?   If you deem yourself fit to play this game, despite the intrepid difficulty made in this game, consider purchasing this game.  If not, then try this game either way.

VVVVVV has a surprisingly intriguing storyline and cast of characters as well as an awesome soundtrack (worth buying if you like chiptune). Its visuals and aforementioned music definitely appeal to the retro-gaming audience but could easily charm even the most modern of gamers. Also if you're a space fanatic like me, you'll be happy to know that that is where the entire story takes place (though not just in one dimension). Despite this, the difficulty of this game is undoubtedly something you should consider before buying it. While completing the story should not take more than a few hours, it will not be without a good deal of frustration and is just about impossible if you lack persistence. A knack for puzzle-solving and the willingness to take risks are also good things to have if you plan on playing this game. Outside of the main story, VVVVVV offers a quite a bit of bonus material and challenges for those who want to take its inherent difficulty to the next level. On that note, if you plan on completing this game 110% be sure to get plenty of rest and stay hydrated because doing so borders the humanly impossible.  Overall, VVVVVV is an excellent game that is both compelling and unique, but not a great choice for the more casual gamer who isn't looking for much of a challenge. 4/5",

And if you put down the game there, the experience would be worthwhile.  But the game's real challenge comes from trying to beat the game with the fewest number of deaths. On a casual run, deaths have no real impact, aside from taking you back to your last checkpoint, of which there are plenty. But once you know the layout of the game, the focus changes from exploration to mastery. Personally, I am not one to care about time trials or speedrunning, or any arbitrary reason to replay the same game over and over again, but VVVVVV is a rare exception to that; the gameplay and level design is just so tight, that each playthrough feels as fresh as the last. And the game length is just perfect for the occasional replay to try and improve your death count.  I think this game has something to offer all fans of retro platformers, whether that's exploring the simple world and finding its secrets, trying to collect all of the optional (and often frustratingly hard) trinkets, or replaying the game to improve upon your best score.",

This game is filled with frustrating design concepts that force you to replay the same situation over and over. Not to mention the sometimes-overly sensitive-sometimes not movement. One pixel hitting a spike? Dead. Pressed on the arrow key for a fraction of a second too long? You will go flying off the platform right into death. Most of the situations in the game aren't actually that hard. But they are just set up in such a way that you will fail over and over until you finally get lucky enough and you can fall down a pit pixel by exact pixel not hitting any spikes on the way down. It would be like trying to drop a quarter into a slot machine from 10 feet up. Its not challenging, just repititive and tedious. Its not enjoyable, its frustrating.   This game is not imaginative. The concepts and level designs have all been done before. This game isn't revolutionary, its not Braid, and it is certaintly no Fez. The concept of changing gravity to move around the world has a lot of potential. But the designer was either a lazy designer or a bad puzzle maker. Instead of making a thoughtful puzzle game that requires much head scratching and brain storming. They went for a cheap 'avoid the red spikes' route. The levels are all mapped out, sure there is an over world. But its laughable compared to what gamers in this day and age are used to. Avoid the spikes, run to the end, rescue the person. Boring.  Now most of that I could live with. Its unimaginative sure, but at least it wasn't too frustrating. But the one thing that did it for me, the one thing that just killed the game for me, was the escort mission. Yeah you heard me, there is an escort mission. I can just imagine the developer sitting around thinking to himself. 'You know what this platformer needs? An escort mission. I bet the player would enjoy that.' Its completely surreal that anyone would even put an escort mission into a platformer. The NPC that you are escorting follows you from a couple feet behind you. So now, not only do you have to make it through the extremely accurate maze riddled with spikes, but you also have to guide this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ NPC through it as well. It got frustrating, fast.  So, even though I love platformers and really wanted to like this game. I can't, I just can't. Don't get me wrong, its fun, for awhile. But then all the bad design choices just leap out at you as you play through the game. Honestly the quality of this game is something I would expect in a common flash game that I played online when I was in middle school. Now if I had recieved the game in that setting, I would have loved it. But that fact that someone is asking money for a game of this quality astounds me.",

The fact that VVVVVV perfectly recreates the arcades of 1980s or challenges the timing skills of players in the fashion similar to “Super Meat Boy” does not oblige anyone to burst into nostalgic tears and rate the game as an indisputable masterpiece. It is not for the lack of atmosphere that I do not recommend the game — old arcades often had an “excuse plot” and that was perfectly fine. It is not the difficulty — these games have nurtured generations of hardcore players that achieved robotic precision mastering the levels (compare “Mega Man”). The overall scale seems too small, the world is not detailed and diverse enough: even within that abstract and geometric style one could have created stupendous mazes with specific traits and unique atmosphere. Could have, but has not. Some suspicion that this game was hyped just because “indie developers must be supported” still lurks in my mind. Creating a game “à la eighties” to honour the timeless 8-bit æsthetics is such a responsible task, and one cannot just take the mechanics and the look of a different epoch and reproduce them using modern approach. Compare Jamestown — a perfect old-school shoot-'em-up game that is really indistinguishable from the 1990s shooters. It is so easy to trick anyone into thinking that it had been created 20 years ago because the look and feel are very convincing. On the contrary, you can’t plausibly think of “VVVVVV” as an 1980s game. With an aching heart I do post this review, without any hope to gain recognition or ingratiate myself with fans’ favour.",

So instead of having your feet pointed toward the bottom, you push the space bar to have your feet pointed to the top and you float to the top. Its a great mechanic.  The game consists of a small open world that lets you go anywhere you'd like all to rescue your crew members. The screen doesn't scroll. When you touch a side of the screen, it brings you to the next screen like Zelda. The game mostly feels like challenge rooms, dodging spikes. Hence the name VVVVVV. There are checkpoints everywhere, so when you get spiked, you'll always go back to the last checkpoint. Later in the game it makes use of the single screen mechanic where if you exit the left, you'll appear on the right side of the same screen. It is a distraction and several 'challenges' span more than one screen. The trippy moving backgrounds don't help either.  The music is happy 8-Bit chip tunes. The simple art style is good, its just not that fun to play. There isn't just precision platforming, but diving down pits and precision platforming, shifting your character in mid air to avoid spikes.  It can all be completed in 90 minutes or less. The game has a few extra modes like time trials and flip where the world is flipped. Its all extra challenge.  If you're the type to enjoy a steep challenge where your only reward is more challenge, then this is the game for you. It has also been in a few bundles for a cheap price, so I'd recommend waiting for a bundle.",
