            "review_text": "Fortunately, the 90's are over and that also means that wandering around on a map, cluelessly while digging your way through a lot of menus trying to figure out where exactly you are or where you are meant to go is also mostly over.  Hard truck: Rise of Clans / Ex machina (I'll shorten that to HRROCEM) is a game where you drive a car. Unfortunately, the car doesn't follow the mouse (only the turret does) and this feature combined with the already clunky controls means it feels like you're piloting a remotely controlled vehicle.  The graphics are nothing to wrote home about, the voice acting is horrendous, the writing is confusing but the game does have some charm. I like the way you can buy new vehicles, mount different types of guns and haul loot all over the place. Like a poor man's Freelancer set in a post-nuclear America.  Unfortunately, I drove my car inside a wall and couldn't get it out any more (the 'return to road' button did nothing. In fact, many buttons that you can bind seem to do nothing. Or maybe they have been mistranslated like so many other thingsI also didn't use the quick-save ability at any point (another thing we left behind in the 90's, thankfully) so I doubt I'll be able to revert to an earlier save game.  I have to say that I really like the theme but everything about this game is just subpar to the point where it just annoys me.   Refund requested.  Note that it ran just fine on Windows 7 64-bit for me. At least for the 30-odd minutes that I played it.",

            "review_text": "  It only took me 2 days to finish the storyline which I found actually short(Half the time I was actually trading and buying and doing side quests). I haven't finished HTA since I don't want to end the game too soon. Anyways just like HTA its the same vehicle combat game rpg with trading and quests. The trucks are the same in addition to adding the scout and the fighter that you can actually drive. The paint jobs got a bit more of an upgrade giving some personality to your truck. Same weapons return just like the previous. I did enjoyed this one but like I said I was bummed that I finished it too early. The boss fights were a bit fustrating and your character tends to kill anything on his path. But hey we got a new region now in North America. But I found em a bit smaller in towns. There were some cities but they were that enough. I still recommend it if you were a fan of HTA.",
