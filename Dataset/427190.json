            "review_text": "In 2006, console players first got to experience Dead Rising, a game which helped pave the way for a more condensed open-world experience brimming with content regardless of map size. Nearly every object in the game could be interacted with, though the interactions often ended up being somewhere along the lines of 'place object in deadly manner alongside nearest zombie.'  Since then, the ice caps melted, Rome was built, modern society emerged, twerking sadly became a thing, and the apocalypse has come a total of at least 7 times. It's now 2016, and PC players are finally able to experience (or re-experience) this gem of a zombie title.",

This is an absolute job well done! For all of those who played the series or have not, play this game. This one was probably the best Dead Rising game! Well..I'm off..going back into the mall.

            "review_text": "Dead Rising is an open world game from 2006 created by Capcom for the Xbox 360. It's one of the earliest killer app titles for the console and was the game most people bought a 360 for prior to Halo 3. At the time it blew people away with how groundbreaking it was in terms of technology and continuously remains on top ten lists to this day.  In Dead Rising you play as Frank West. A journalist who enters the small town of Willamette Colorado by helicopter. Dropped onto the roof of the local mall, he has 3 days to figure out the origin of the zombie apocalypse that has befallen the town, and return to the roof alive in the process. Frank is the anchor the game hinges around, he's a loveable selfish scoundrel who has a ton of lines that are instantly quotable. While the rest of the characters are kind of forgettable, you want to finish the game purely because you wanna see what Frank does next.   Compared to the later games in the series and even other zombie survival games Dead Rising is very different, and infact feels foreign and hostile to the player. For starters, you have a very strict time limit. Frank has 72 hours to complete all of his objectives, and the game enforces this harshly. You can only complete your objectives within a certain time period. And this leaves very little time to explore the mall or screw around. Likewise, most of the player's weapons are household objects like baseball bats and power tools. And they break very quickly. The mall is entirely filled with zombies, and you can see up to 800 zombies on the screen at once. But the zombies aren't the player's objective, they're an obstacle. And the inherant fun of the game is finding unique ways to get around them. It is very enjoyable to carve a path through a bunch of zombies while saving all of your weapons and healing items for a tougher encounter later.   After completing the game's initial 72 hour mode, there's an additional 'Overtime' mode that lasts an additional day, and a more interesting 'Infinity' mode. Infinity mode spawns Frank in the mall, and you continuously lose health due to hunger. And the objective is to continuously find more food items in the mall so you can keep yourself alive. It's a really fun mode and I was slightly disappointed in later Dead Rising games they removed hunger entirely in their sandbox modes. It's one of the most immersive optional modes to a game I've ever played.   While Dead Rising was liked for it's technical innovations, it was remembered for its humor. Frank is a joy to play as but there's also this Japanese style of humor. Frank can wear silly costumes and use silly weapons like toy megabusters. This is all juxtaposed with a mostly down to Earth and relatively serious story. Compared to the later Dead Rising games, this contrast feels the most amusing and works the best.   Lastly the game was not ported to PC until 2016. I can safely say the PC port feels just right, with only a slight handful of bugs. It also allows you to play in mouse and keyboard with rebindable keys, along with gamepad support and support for higher anti aliasing, framerates and resolutions up to 4K. It also includes the relatively pointless cosmetic DLC from the original 360 version, so you can sleep easy knowing this is now the definitive version of the game.",

            "review_text": "For someone like me who didn't have the chance to play this when it was out for the 360 because I never owned one and was only able to play the terrible and severely watered down 'Dead Rising: Chop 'Till You Drop' on the Nintendo Wii, this port is definately needed in my library.  While the game is fairly aged and has its share of problems this is a great game that shouldn't be missed. If you are a fan of Dead Rising 2, DR2 OTR and DR3 then you are going to love seeing the origin of it all as well as playing as one of the most badass characters of all time, even if it doesn't exactly seem like it. But he's covered wars, you know? Just don't expect it to be as good as them as many features were not implimented at the time.  PRO - Large open Wilamette mall to discover and roam - Characters and psychopaths are all fun, scary and unique - Lots and lots of zombies on screen - Remaster really does it justice, looks and sounds great - Music is awesome, particularly the psychopath boss themes - Story is really interesting and a unique take on the zombie genre if not being a little cheesy here and there - Entire game is timed which gives you a fun sense of pressure that doesn't ruin the game - Bosses are challenging and take preparation - Unlockables and achievements to go for - Replayability is high - Loading screens are basically non existent  CON - Survivor AI is really clunky which causes them to get stunlocked many, many times on zombies - Survivors also seem to get themselves stuck on random objects and even other suvivors which makes you waste time sorting their problems out and in a game where you're constantly on the clock it feels frustrating - Didn't feel like enough food items were placed around, some resteraunt areas are deprived of food items  All in all its a great game and really fun to play even if the suvivours can get you annoyed. That's the charm of replaying old games.",

I'm a little disappointed there is a noticable momentary frame rate drop when you send a bunch of zombies flying (disappointing because it's a 10 year old game running on pretty beefy hardware, a 2GB GTX 960 + 4GHz i7 + 32GB RAM). These moments of slowdown never impact playability though. The textures look a little dated close up, but otherwise the game looks and plays fantastic on PC. Gamepad support is good without any extra trickery.  This is one of Capcom's finest, I'm glad to see it on Steam.",

            "review_text": "The team who did the Dragon's Dogma PC port once again did a great job of bringing this 10 year old game to PC. The game allows you to switch between KBM and controller schemes on the fly, and controls are completely rebindable. Good selection of graphic options, including borderless windowed and choosing between 30, 60 or unlimited framerate. Entire time I've been playing I have experienced no crashing or game stopping bugs, except for the infamously idiotic survivor AI, which isn't a result of a bad port but more a lack of polish on the original thing.  As for the game, the first Dead Rising I played was 2, and I must say the lack of the more gimmicky features of the later games makes DR1 refreshing to play. The later changes to include more and more powerful weapons comes at the price of making the zombies feel less threatening; one combo weapon in DR3 makes entire zombie hordes a complete joke, letting you simply mash X in large groups and get immense amounts of PP. Combine that with being able to create said weapon at any point, so long as you have the parts (which get brain dead easy later), and the game loses an incredible amount of tension, making the game a lot more boring as a result. It's almost a reverse effect: the crazier the weapons and attacks get, the less interesting the game becomes. In Dead Rising 1 this isn't the case; zombies are a bigger threat due to not having overpowered weapons readily available, and the zombies themselves being more aggressive and not so easy to shove aside, espeically in large groups. The zombies being an actual threat make the game a hell of a lot more interesting to play. This is looking waaay far into the future, but if a Dead Rising 5 happens, I only hope the zany combo weapons get toned down so it feels there's at least some resistance to moving around.  Like I said earlier, the first Dead Rising I played was 2, because I had never owned a 360. This port is my first time ever playing this game, and if this port had never happened, I might've never played this game. Same goes with Dragon's Dogma (although it was on PS3, I'll take 60 fps any day). I'm very thankful for Capcom putting money into gambling a rerelease of a 10 year old game, and I hope they decide to make more smart moves in the future, either with great port jobs or WHERE THE HELL IS DEEP DOWN CAPCOM",

Just a tip for peeps who are trying to beat Infinity Mode, If you do have the Real Mega Buster skip ahead until the big AHHH caps, Don't do Infinity yet, instead do story mode but ignore the cases and go straight into the parking lot and grab a car and start going crazy in the maintence tunnels but stay close to the entrance/exit so incase your car breaks you are a couple feet away. Repeat until you obtain Zombie Genocider, then wait on the helipad for Ending B. , AHHH , If you are a busy man but still want to beat this game you can try leaving your computer on. If its a laptop I recommend just unplugging the charger and closing the game on Power Saver cuz if you don't, Your local firefighters are gonna drop by and say hi. Try and get all 3 health magazines. *Survival is in the empty store in North Plaza, right next to Crislips* *Health 1 is in Sir Books-A-Lot, Wonderland Plaza* *Health 2 is in Entrance Plaza in Everyone Luvs Books* and try and ration food. A strategy I used is to barricade in a certain area with tons of food, put them in a single pile. And wait until your health goes down to one, pick a food out of the pile, eat it, then wait some more. If your food gets lower than 8 then you have to find more food. I went to Food Court on Day 1, then I traveled to Al Fresca where Isabela with a motorcycle was attacking on Day 2, I went and started roaming around the entire map, until I realized Carlito is in the maintence tunnels with more food. I roamed to Colby's Movieland and took all the food there. Then I started depending on Survivors and Psychopaths for food. The review may have so many grammar mistakes. I am pretty sure that last sentence about mistakes also had a mistake.  ",

I imagine most of you out there are reading this because you want to gauge whether or not this is a good port, and I am happy to say that it is a great one.  There aren't an absurd amount of customizable options, however, I feel that there are enough options that allow you to alter the graphical settings as well as the controller/keyboard settings. Plus, changes can be made on the fly and don't require restarts or launchers, which is always nice.  The framerate is uncapped if you so desire and the keyboard controls can be completely rebound, which is excellent. Even during the most hectic of moments I found that the framerate was very stable, only noticing the occasional minor drop as the screen is completely flooded with zombies. Loading screens are nice and fast too, barely giving you enough time to register the image on screen before you're instantly loaded back into the next location, which is superb as you will be passing through loading screens quite often throughout the game. Lastly, the addition of 5 save slots is very welcome as the original only had one, but being able to save onto multiple slots throughout allows for you to split off from the story and try out other possibilites without having to start over, which I adore due to the always ticking clock and time management aspects of the game.  In terms of negatives, I personally don't have any, but I wish to include some anyway just in case they affect you. - It has been reported that save files have known to become corrupted on a number of different systems, I'm not entirely sure of what causes this, but I hope they fix it soon. - It has also been reported in other reviews that occasionally the user is greeted with a 'Failed to Initialize DirectX' message when trying to launch the game, which affects a number of systems and is fixable, however, this issue really shouldn't be here at all and I hope they get around to fixing that too.  While none of these issues affect me, that doesn't mean that they don't exist and it's possible that they will affect you as a result, so please do a little bit of research prior to purchase so you know what you're getting into. The Steam Refund is there for a reason, after all.  Finally, in terms of Dead Rising itself, I adore it. It's one of my favourite games of all time from 'way back' on the 360 over 10 years ago, and to this day I still feel that it holds up remarkably well despite it's problems, boasting some over-the-top violence while still sporting a well thought out story with lots of neat little ideas to boot. I have played through this game so many times in the past, and I fully intend to play through it many more now that it has finally come to PC.  I'm giving it a very solid recommendation, for both newcomers to the series and to those that played it when it was first released.",

            "review_text": "Oh my lord the memories are coming back to me. I remember playing the Demo on the Xbox and I couldn't stop playing it. So my dad bought me the game a few days after it came out and , aha, me being young and easily scared. My stomach turned when I accidentally got Jeff and Natalie killed. You know when they get swarmed by zombies and then there's a cut scene of the zombies eating them alive? Yeah that scared the bajeebers out of me. So much so I just switched off the Xbox and didn't play DR for like 8 months. When I picked it up again I was face palming myself for even being scared of this game but back then I never played an actual game which contained zombies apart from Simpsons Hit and Run. But upon picking it back up. I became super addicted. Took me until I was level 40 before I got to the facts. I was addicted but I wasn't any good lol.  Okay that's my story the way, now for the steam review.  This rerelease is perfect. In every. Single. Way. They've kept the clunky graphics. With the terrible facial expressions, the idiotic UI where they can't figure out how to walk around a desk and constantly calling for your help. God help you if you're escorting more than 2 survivers. The developers have tried to keep it as pure as possible and I'm eternally grateful for that. If you're an old dead rising fan contemplating purchasing this, just do it. If you haven't played the series... Again. Just buy this.  53594/10  Now can other developers follow capcom and rerelease old games that never made it to pc or if they did, have a terrible port but now it's the time to fix that. I'm looking at you 2k games. It'd be nice to see The Darkness 1 on PC. Bungie with Halo 3.",

There is great diversity in the weapons that you can choose from, and it's balanced in a way that no other zombie game is. Almost every weapon in the game is useful, so even if your mini chainsaw (the most OP weapon in the game) breaks in the middle of a zombie horde, you can grab that mannequin torso from the nearby clothing store and still be fine. The timer is a fantastic addition, but it's not for everyone. It adds a certain level of stress to the game, however if you're interested in exploring instead of the quests or subquests, just ignore the timer and you'll be fine.  The setting is incredible. This is one aspect that the sequels to this game failed at. DR1 combines seriousness and spookiness with just the right about of silliness. It's a goofy game at times, but at other times there is a very serious horror/drama undertone. I personally think that DR2 and 3 took the silliness to the extreme and ruined the tone of their games.   Overall, I cannot recommend this game enough. As a port it had a few issues at launch, particularly with saving, but I've updated to the latest patch and it runs like a dream. Up to 4k resolutions supported and uncapped FPS. Easily one of the best games of the year, despite being originally released over 10 years ago.",

(Fustrating if you are a beginner but fun) I'm the kind of person that won't stop playing a game until i completely finish it. Also don't worry if you mess up! Game has a bunch of different endings.   Helpful tips: ~ Otis pretty much calls you to tell you the location of every survivor. However there is about 5 survivors you have to find on your own. Mostly everyone never finds these people.  ~ Every psychopath has a hostage held captive so don't forget to check every room/ride near by.  ~ Beware of giving the black guy the gun.  ~ Photograph everything &amp; everyone! Max photos to have is 30 so lock them in to save the ones you want to keep. Also there is a battery changer on the first store to the right when exiting from the security room. (Was fustrating when my camera died &amp; i didnt know what to do) ~ Save often! Game has an auto save when finishing a full case file but you might die a bunch of times before you reach it.",

Half as many weapons, the inability to aim over the shoulder while moving, and Frank West's desire to photograph the scoop of a lifetime make the player considerably more vulnerable. He's dedicated to get to the bottom of that case, though. It's cool, he's covered wars.   In 2016, Dead Rising's expected flaws do not detract from the suspense and satisfaction it has to offer.

            "review_text": "What can I say about this game? I remember having to ask my dad to buy it for me because it was one of the first rated M xbox 360 games I bought. I went home popped it in my Xbox 360 and ever sense I have developed a love for this game like no other. I have at least over 800 hours on this game on Xbox 360 and intend to have many more on PC.  PROS ------ 1. Better story than the others. This is subjective however I feel less is more sometimes. The story is simple, but well put together and without any SO RANDUMB twists like in DR3 ending. 2. Better engine/graphics ----------------------------  In 2 the blood pours out in buckets, in a fight of 3 zombies you can literally be covered in GALLONS of blood head to toe. The zombies in 2 are also all oddly white, and not grey or pale I mean CHALK WHITE very unpleasing look for zombies they don't look disgusting they look plastic. This game uses the MT FRAMEWORK engine an engine used by games such as LOST PLANET, DMC4, RESIDENT EVIL 5, and many more. The particle effects are subpar but the motions, animations and overall graphics are much better than Dead Rising 2 and on some points 3. Look are the running animations of DR2vs DR1. The animations in DR1 are smoother, and more lifelike than the jagid, slow, choppy animations in DR2 and partly in DR3.   3. Better Zombie AI ---------------------- The zombies in this game actually attack you. They might not kill you everytime you play but ending a fight with a psychopath on low health and walking through crowded areas are extremely dangerous. On DR2/3 you can literally walk through hundreds of zombies and take maybe 2-3 hits MAX. The zombies are extremely UNagressive in those games.  4. Better psychopaths ------------------------ In 2-3 the psychopaths for the MOST part are absolutely unbelieveable and unoriginal. 2= a crazy motorcycle contestant? A crazy man in a full mascot suit? A crazy virgin? 3= A crazy hungry fat lady? A crazy asain KUNG FU MASTER????  Are you seeing a trend here? Crazy... Everyone when you meet them is already crazy for aboslutely no reason. In Dead rising 1 most psychopaths are simply 'defending themselves' in their mind. They are pushed into the insane realm out of desperation and fear it gives you the feeling that you are fighting survivors that are simply pushed to the edge instead of fighting insane asylum patients.   5. Better placement of objects/ Better design ------------------------------------------------ The ENTIRE pull of Deadrising wasn't to be Saints row 3/4 with zombies. It wasn't KILL ANY ZOMBIES YOU WANT WITH WACKY LASERS AND PINK BICYCLES!!!! LOLOL SO RANDUMB!!!! It was using ANY object whenever you wanted to fight off the undead horde under a strict time limit while trying to fend off insane survivors and figure out what was going on at this mall. Throughout DR2-3 you can find objects placed for convienence for the player. Simply put, why would I ever use a teddy bear, chair, garbage can, or any other object when I can combine them on a whims notice to make a teddybear chair garbage can launcher?? In dead rising 1 you HAD to use ANY object you could to keep the aggressive zombies off of you. Chairs were placed where people would sit, power tools were in POWER TOOL stores, and sharp knives were in knife shops, and the likes. In DR2-3 you can ALWAYS find 2-3 objects to make a combo weapon in EVERY store or nearby. Why is there a newspaper and a bottle of jack in a toy store? Why is there a computer case and flashlight in a gun store? Its to make the players life easier by babyfying him.   CONS ---------  1. Worse Survivor AI ---------------------  The survivor AI is noticeably worse in this game and make rescuing them a hasstle. It is one of the few things they corrected in later instalments  2. Harder for beginners  -------------------------  The time limit will make you fail. You more than likely wont get the 'ture ending' (inside joke for those who played the xbox 360 version) your first try. However this encourages replays. It makes you go through the game mulitple times to level up. This is were later instalments fall short. Why would I go back to a game that I beat and 100% the first time? The timer is hard but encourages you to get better. However I put it as a con becuase many people may not like it.  3. Less Zombies on screen  ------------------------------- Since it is an older Dead Rising less zombies could be fit on screen and with zombie pop up in the background then it may not feel like a HORDE is coming your way untill you make it underground.       All in all this is not only my favorite Dead Rising but my favorite video game as well. I have put countless hours into ALL the dead risings and shamefully await Dead Rising 4 just to say I played it and to see what they do with the game. My hope are not high but only time will tell.  DO GET THIS GAME IF = you want a decent challenge with a 'dawn of the dead' esque feel, use ANY weapon you can to defend yourself, or want a game with an unoriginal yet good story with no LOL IM ACTUALLY THE VILLAN moments.  DO NOT GET THIS GAME IF = You don't like challenge or failing, you don't like no hand holding, you NEED to complete everything the first time around.  10/10  1/1  1  1# game   HELLO?

This is not a hate review this is a review of what I have physically seen playing this game. These issues should have never made its way to the remastered version.    Pros ------ (+) Better textures and visuals (Increased draw distance)   (+) 60 FPS (Stable)  (+) 4K support (Xbox 360 maxed at 1080i)  (+) Best Dead Rising game in the series   (+) Fun gameplay with great cut scenes   Cons  ------- (-) The prisoners in Leisure Park keep respawing even after you kill all three. This goes on numerous times and makes it nearly impossible to escourt surviors to the security room.   (-) Terrible survivor ai plagues this game like the Xbox 360 version but worse. The survivors never seem to follow you even when calling them. They always seem to walk right into a horde of zombies and die within a few seconds. Try giving them a weapon? Your results will be even worse because now they'll just target any zombie whether close or far and waste more precious time.   (-) Zombie capacity increase. This was something I noticed right away. It appears the amount of zombies have been doubled or even tripled in certain areas making escourting survivors even more challenging. Stocking up on quickstep barely helps avoiding confrontations because it doesn't last long enough. I understand this is a zombie game and all but this was not how the Xbox 360 version was. The Xbox 360 version couldn't possibly have these amount of zombies due to hardware limitations but on PC the amounts are just ridiculous. Even veteran players like myself struggle to complete missions with enough time. It's only logical that if the amount of zombies were increased so should the intelligence of the survivors.   (-) No indicator to determine the quality of your weapons. This was never in the Xbox 360 version but thought it should have been included in the remastered version. When you attack zombies your weapons gradually begin to get weaker eventually breaking. There should have been a percentage bar under each weapon showing how much is left. This would enable the player to have more strategy in fights.   (-) Long dialogue with survivors. In order to have survivors team up you must first interact with them. The amount of dialogue there is before the survivor joins is way too long. There should have been an ability to speed past the dialogue to avoid sneaky zombies from attacking you from behind or even the survivor.     Conclusion  ---------------- I personally love Dead Rising. I still believe this game is and will always be the best but this applies to the Xbox 360 version not PC. The gradual changes that have been applied have modified this game making it something different then what it once was. If you truly want the best experience play the Xbox 360 version.",

            "review_text": "I never played this game when it came out on the consoles, so this review is made without all of the nostalgia and fanboy fawning that the vast majority of reviews here seem to have. It was probably good back in its day, but it does not hold up as a modern PC game. Reasons are:  1. The game is Nintendo Hard. It uses save points (vomit), and the save points are few and far between, and often require killing dozens, if not hundreds of enemies to reach them. You can easily lose hours of progress trying to get to a save point. Everything is timed, and you sometimes are not given tutorials until AFTER you needed to do something, there are things you will never get right the first time, making it necessary to restart from your last save and lose hours because you did not know a needed gameplay mechanic ahead of time.  2. The AI of your allies is terrible. You have to escort characters back to the saferoom, but if you don't give them a weapon, they wait til you get about 50 feet away and run straight toward you, usually right into zombies, OR if you give them a weapon they go full Leeroy Jenkins and charge at the enemy zombies, and get swarmed.  3. The gun system is terrible. Not only are they impossibly weak, but they are all auto-aim, and there's no way to know what your character will shoot at. A zombie could be two feet from you and you'll shoot the gun only to hit an enemy standing 15 feet behind it. And unless you are on flat, level ground shooting at a target on the same elevation, the AI will not recognize the enemy and not shoot at it.  4. Under some circumstances, enemy respawns are nearly instantaneous. You can kill 30 zombies, walk ten feet past them, and get attacked from behind because 10 more spawned in as soon as you took the camera off of their location.  Overall, the gameplay is fun, but there are simply too many frustrating and unnecessary 'features' artificially increasing the difficulty to make it fun for a PC gamer.",

The survivor AI that continues to be the butt of so many jokes is STILL a thing.  Difficulty curve just happens out of the blue, with little indication and bare minimum resources to prepare for it. They have not included the additions they added in DR2 onwards such as moving while aiming, checkpoints, dialogue box skipping, etc.  Also, ♥♥♥♥ the convicts. Seriously. 10 years on and they still such poorly designed pieces of ♥♥♥♥.",
