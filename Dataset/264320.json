            "review_text": "I don't know if I have the patience to finish this one, folks. Even though the artwork is fantastic, which has gotten me through several hours, this gameplay is wretched. You may have already read about the fact that you must click after ever single sentence just to get the next sentence or action to take place. I can almost handle that. The puzzles are uninteresting, but when you complete one and talk to a character about it, they still try to give you clues about that same puzzle. Add the fact that the navigation is slow and the writers obviously think they're hilarious and you have yourself a meh experience so much so that I need a really long run-on sentence to describe it.  Go find another point &amp; click adventure.  ",

            "review_text": "  Captain Morgane and the Golden Turtle   is a point &amp; click adventure game. As her father gives her command of the ship for her birthday, Morgane accepts a charter to seek out the legendary Golden Turtle by following a trail of clues the famous explorer Buckleberry Tanner left behind him.   Pros : The point &amp; click genre is well represented as you pick up a whole assortment of objects and trinkets on your adventure, using them and combining them in creative and often funny ways to progress in the story. You come across a couple of strange or wacky characters on your adventure, and there's a few out-of-place reference to other games and movies in a hit-and-miss attempt to mimic the humor found in golden age Sierra and LucasArts games. The voice acting is ok, at least for the most part, and backgrounds look like the caricatural hand drawn style you'd expect. The story is child-friendly, and you must keep in mind that it's likely the target audience of the game as there is little to no jokes, not even subtle ones, targeted at a more mature audience.   Cons : The characters' 3D sprites clash strongly with the 2D cartoony background, and I'm not convinced it was the best choice. The story is short, and the puzzles aren't enough to make it the lengthy experience a   Monkey Island   or   Space Quest   game would be. Some jokes are corny even for children, I wouldn't even expect any giggle from a younger player.   Verdict : ★★★☆☆ - It's up to you  I'll recommend this for younger players looking for slightly challenging puzzles, but adults will find it easy and perhaps even a bit of a boring tale. It doesn't quite reach the levels of other point &amp; click, but although I'm not the player this game is for, it still gets an 'ok' from me.  —————————————————————————   This was just my opinion.   If you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up, and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated)  reviews . ",

Most of the puzzles makes sense, I feel like most of the complaining is coming from people who aren't really familiar with point and clicks as the 'cons' are gameplay elements in most classics.   It's definitely one of the better pirate games on steam. The artwork is good and the voice acting decent enough.",

When I realised I had to click to continue every page of *spoken* dialogue I was irritated. When the first mini-game used the same keys that rotate your screen I was downright annoyed. When I alt+tabed out to fix the problem, then couldn't alt+tab back into the game because it had crashed, I quit.",

Low requirement, runs quite smoothly and whatnot. Story is quite enjoyable as well.   However there's also a downside to it. 1. Game is prone to bugs/crashes at certain point (for me it's chapter 7 entering Governor office cause crash and prevents me proceeding) 2. Do NOT ever verify integrity of local game cache as it seems to wipe all your data - settings and save files  In overall, you guys could give it a try but not everyone will like this genre. I know I do. Please fixcrashes devs, I have to replay for 3rd time and I hope I don't have to do it the 4th time :(",
