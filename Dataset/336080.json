            "review_text": "Full disclosure: review copy provided by developer/publisher!  Boy, how do I put this?  Vietnam '65 is a lot like the divisive conflict it depicts: muddy, ugly, and seemingly nonsensical.   It's 1965 and war is in the air. For the last decade America has been ratcheting up her presence in the troubled region while France and Japan watch on knowingly, having tried to woo Vietnam with guerrilla warfare and baguettes in the past. And while America too would become weary and stop her particular explod-y romancing, 1965 was just the beginning of serious courtship. But enough with this weird sexy subtext history lesson, how's the game?  The game starts off giving you an overview map of the (procedurally generated) Ia Drang Valley. You have a base on one end of the map, and the rest of the map is populated with little villages and forests full of Charlie. From that base you deploy infantry, army engineers, helicopters, tanks... pretty much anything and everything to change the tide, and move them across the hex grid. You build roads and tear down forest to better navigate, you search for mines and set up ambushes, you build forward and fire bases, and you resupply your units in the field. All the while you have to juggle political capital to keep the war going, and that capital is affected by how successful your efforts are in putting down NVA, Vietcong, and turning the local populace to your cause. Some very cool ideas happening here, including the political capital, “hearts and minds” thing, the fact that your military accomplishments and achievements are displayed on a uniform, and the fact that you have to build equal parts to explode.  BUT.  But. These things happen seemingly arbitrarily (seemingly, anyway. Apparently troop levels, American and communist, influence sympathies). Some villages raised American flags in support while others chose the communist North, for reasons not entirely clear initially. Enemies pop in and out of nowhere (an interesting way to depict the guerrilla warfare that marked the conflict, but it just looks lazy and rushed. The developer has told me they appear on the Ho Chi Minh trail so it isn't at random per se, but they still will just materialize as if out of nothing). And the resupplying gets real old real fast, flying choppers sometimes every three turns to feed your hungry units in the field. It's boring, monotonous, repetitive, and tiresome. You play the game once, you've played it a dozen times.  Vietnam '65 is a lot like something you download from the App Store, play in the airport while you wait for a flight, and promptly delete after a game or two – all the while muttering how you need to manage your money better, how eight dollars here and eight dollars there add up eventually, how you could have read a book and bettered yourself. Maybe you start crying and people start recording you on their phones and you're a reluctant viral sensation – I've lost my train of thought again.  The game doesn't just FEEL like a tired App Store game, it looks the part too. Sharp, PS1 textures and models, awkward, janky movements, bad tutorial, poorly explained mechanics, one game type, an options menu that allows you to change the volume and admire the developer credits. It's just lame, it's pathetic, and in a market full of classic and brave new strategy games, why bother with this drek? Even for you history buffs out there, this isn't the Vietnam War game that breaks the crappy mold.  Avoid this one. When there's literally dozens of amazing strategy games out there right now for the taking, why bother with bad, lazy iPad ports?",

            "review_text": "As an oldie ive always enjoyed the hex war games and was happy when I saw this and quickly purchased it. Their are quite a few downsides to the game such as its limited replayability, once you realise that holding 5 of the 10 villages while keeping units supplied pretty much guarantees a win then the game becomes slightly boring, the way VC units appear then vanish into thin air after they attack is a little strange, and the way things are destroyed if they are attacked more than once, I also found the task of resupplying units rather tedious after a short time.  On a positive note there are achievements which give the game some extra playability but still I found the overall gameplay rather tedioius and linear..... for this reason I couldnt recommend the game",

            "review_text": "It's pretty much just what it appears to be, the 1st Cavalry Division's version of la Drang. That is to say, it has very little in common with the actual realities of the la Drang campaign or the war in Vietnam as a whole.   The 'Hearts &amp; Minds' of villages are gained primarily by killing NVA/VC. Think about that for a second. Not even US strategists were so deluded to totally conflate the concepts of 'Hearts &amp; Minds' and 'Body Count'.   Purely as a game, It's not all that interesting or fun to warrant repeated play either. That said, I find it pretty funny that many other reviewers are complaining about the importance of supply in the game and the the elusiveness of the NVA/VC.   If you're looking for a true poli-mil simulation of Vietnam, look into the board game Fire in the Lake.   ",

            "review_text": "November, 1965 South Vietnam.  In the past two years the Vietcong  (National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam a.k.a. the Viet Cong) , with support of the North Vietnamese Peoples Army (NVA), established a foothold in southwest Vietnam, along the Cambodian border. Running supplies and reinforcements from north to south Vietnam. Since December 1964 the South Vietnamese army repeatedly suffered major defeats against North Vietnam, to the point of breaking.  To prevent that a first deployment of just 3500 Marines in a defensive role in March '65, quickly escalated to 200.000 GI's by December '65. Marking the beginning of a full grown offensive ground war, of the US and his allies, against North Vietnam. In a plan to destroy the enemy and his infrastructure in 12 to 18 month. 10 years and 1 month later at April 30th 1975, the last US Soldiers left Vietnam by the largest helicopter evacuation in history.  This game recapture the events starting in November '65. When the US for the fist time implement Air-mobility doctrine &amp; Air-Assault tactics. Trying to hunt down enemy forces and interrupt supply lines (Ho-Chi-Minh Path, HCMP), in even the most remote parts of Vietnam. By deploying, supporting and extracting an entire Battalion size force just by helicopters. Making the Bell UH-1D Iroquois (Huey) the maybe most iconic helicopter in the world.  You got 45 turns to secure the valley running from the Cambodian border, and win the hearth &amp; minds of the civilian population. Stopping VC reinforcements coming down the Ho-Chi-Minh path, and the NVA from crossing the Cambodian border. Setting up bases and trying to wipe you off the map. You see, it's all easy peasy. ;)  Vietnam '65 is certainly one of those addictive easy to learn, but hard to master games, with the excitement of a rogue like game. The game seems easy and simple at first, but soon you will find out real thinking and deductive skill are asked for. When trying to figure out the pattern of VC sightings, to pinpoint possible locations of Ho-Chi-Minh trail spawn points across the valley. Then building forward bases in strategic locations, from which your units will operate to lay ambush to any VC coming down the HCMP. Inviting a Claymore mine full of surprises.  For just $10 bucks this game is not only a bargain, but for me personally already amoung the best strategy games of 2015 with a high re-playability value. Almost like FTL back then.  Movie recommendation:  We Were Soldiers (2002)  [www.imdb.com]  with Mel Gibson, Sam Elliot Madeleine Stowe and Clark Gregg. This movie depicts the first conducted Air-Assault in history, from November 15th to 18th in the La Drang valley  (The Valley of Death) , near the Cambodian border. Leaving 308 GI's dead in just 4 days. One-third of the entire force.",

            "review_text": "Wow, what a great little strategy game. Don't be discouraged by how the enemy melts away into the jungle. This is supposed to happen and is part of the rules of the game as an abstraction of the war. If you are confused by what is happening, do read the manual. At first glance, it might seem like there isn't much going on here (i.e. go forth and seek and destroy). But the robust logistics system in the game is really the meat and potatoes. You can't sit back on your laurels either once you get your first foot hold. The political points system forces the player to keep on the offensive even after building a firebase. Veteran is pretty hard, at least for me. I wish there was an intermediate difficulty level between low and high - that is the only critique I have.",

Sadly for the media and the unwashed hippies Vietnam '65 plays out just a tiny bit differently. You'll be spending most of your time handling your Hueys and Chinooks as they drop supplies and perform medevacs. The objective of the game is to play out the role of Osama bin Laden's proverbial strong horse in the eyes of America's greatest allies, the South Viet-Namese people, by competently patrolling the villages surrounding the randomly generated Drang River. As the days go by more and more NVA regulars will come along to be a nuisance to the player, giving him cause to call in air-strikes, Patton tanks and most importantly even more Hueys and Chinooks to supply the arsenal of democracy. Prolonged incremental suppression and physical removal of communist cells in Chu Pong Massif will eventually net the player a hard-earned victory, if he has enough freedom to live up to the challenge.
