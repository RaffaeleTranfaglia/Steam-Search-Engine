            "review_text": "Let's start with this - EeOneGuy is a RUSSIAN 'famous' youtuber, no one knows him outside russia (and probably cis), so, why are you made game about him on steam, let alone in English, no one knows him here, and no one gives a ♥♥♥♥ about him either. That out of the way, next is the game... All i can say is - Generic, all this game can be discribed with only one this word. This is generic 'rage platformer', with generic music and absolutely bland and generic graphics. And, once again, why EeOneGuy is in here? To make more money of russian babys that like him? Coz' it could be any generic Vasya, and it still will not make any difference.  My friend sent this game to me, now he missing some legs, don't worry tho, he has plenty of them left.",
