I could recommed this only at very low price, paid ~15 euros myself and have been playing ~2 hours and feel dissapointment.",

            "review_text": "Really good version of the old classic. I played the original Wings a lot on Amiga when I was a child.  If you have played the original and liked it so you will most certainly like this game as well. And for those who haven't played the original game but still want something casual to play every now and a then so I warmly recommend that you buy Wings.  I really like how the game has the possibility to change to the old soundtrack and the voice acting that is added for this remake is spot on to create the mood.  One thing that I miss though (or maybe I just have failed to get that event) is when enemy plane comes behind you in dogfight. So in the old Amiga game the view would change so that you see the situation behind the enemy plane. So that both planes are in view at the same time and then you need to evade the bullets of that enemy.  I tried for so long to get that but didn't happen...the enemy was just shooting me and the view didn't change.  But that aside I really like the models made for this game. Although the scarf looks a bit funky from time to time.   Really good game for the fans of the old game and for casual gamers. Maybe 15€ is a bit high price when thinking that the missions might get a bit repetative if you play in longer sessions. But I would say that this is a must buy if you ever see it on -25% or more 10/10",

            "review_text": "Haven't even played 30 minutes and i can already tell you i can't recommend this game, not even on sale. I bought it on sale myself for like 2 euro. I already feel the massive repeatativeness of the game, every single mission is exactly the same, and the flying is terrible, the controls are clunky, and the graphics are horrible. And i even played it with controller.  Now it hurts me a little that this game was so poorly designed, because i used to play the original on the amiga for many many hours, and i also beat the game back in the day. I even remember the day i went to the local store and bought it.  Back then this game was the bomb, it was soo good. So it baffles me a little bit that these guys were so lazy in remaking this title. It clearly shows this is nothing more than a cashgrab and delivers nothing new to the table other than 3D enviroments, some music overhaul and voice acting. To top it off some cool features from the original game was removed in this remake, for no other reason i can think of rather they didn't have the skills to pull it off. Like landing the plane safely after being shot down for example.  They should have worked harder on this game, and added something new. For example something as simple as being able to use rudder to yaw the plane. Yes, exactly. You can't even do that. You can't accelerate or slow down the plane either, it goes in the exact same speed all the time. Extremely lazy remake.  Sorry cinemaware, i used to be one of your fans, i bought many games that you made, and they were all great. But this is not good enough, not even close. It's clear you didn't even try.",

It had a place in my heart at 17, and retains it more than 20 years later.",
