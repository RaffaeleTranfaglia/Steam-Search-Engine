This game is a bullet hell with permadeath, with single-stick shooter controls and based on runs.  What is single-stick shooter? You only move and the character shoots in auto. This is, in my opinion, better than the twin-stick-shooter system, because it reduces complexity (moving and aiming at the same time), and allows you to focus on movement. This does not mean the game is not hard, just watch someone play the new insanity mode or finish a desecration run.  If you like Binding of Isaac, I strongly recommend this game. Also for the fans of other bullet hells/rogue-likes, I recommend you give this game a chance.",

The classic style with one-stick controlls make it the most fun game I have played in a while.

The aesthetic of the graphics and sfx/music is really unique and the single stick shooter style gameplay is surprisingly complex. Plus, the items and organs add so much to every build! The combination of unlocks and permadeath is working really well so far: All of your character's stats and items are reset when you die, but progress you make unlocks the possibility of new items spawning. It keeps making me want to play another run to try to find the latest eyeball or heart I've unlocked.  Also, the single stick style of the game lends itself surprisingly well to the Steam Controller. I'm loving playing it on the couch in the living room, the art looks amazing on a big TV!  ",

You can tell the developer is a fan of HP Lovecraft with the squid monsters and the hub of your adventuring being Miskatonic University. It helps that it's only one stick and you auto shoot the closest mob because it makes this little gem a brain dead shooter. Something to play while you wait to go to work or something I would imagine. The graphics are very retro while also having some 3D here and there.   My only complaint is the lackluster music and sound effects. But it is supposed to be SNES retro so I think that's what the dev's were going for.   Nevertheless, it is a hard as nails roguelite type game with upgrades so you will get alot of gameplay out of Deathstate. Definately buy if you're a fan of simplistic roguelike type games.",

            "review_text": "Deathstate is a fun game. There's not much doubting that. It's also very frustrating. Also no doubting that.  The mechanics are easy to master, and with the variety of mostly useless equipment that you can pick up, most runs will be quite different than each other, and this is a good thing. The graphical style is pleasing, and the colors are quite nice, even though sometimes enemy bullets seem to blend in with everything else. The music is very good, and is probably the first soundtrack I've heard in a while that had a true retro feel to it.  Bullet Hell, Rougelike. Painful heaven.  However, I think that there are two poor decisions made with it.  If you want to make a difficult skill based game, that's fine. Dark Souls is fairly difficult with mechanics that can be mastered, Touhou is a series another good example of that. However, I feel that even will skill, the reason this game will still be difficult is not because it requires luck, but rather because of the visual filter that frequently brightens and can sometimes pulsate, making bullets impossible to see. Or, at least, very difficult to see. I can't judge if this was an intentional decision to increase difficulty, or if it was simply a stylistic choice. It /feels/ like a cheap way to increase difficulty, and I don't like that one bit.  The second, and probably more minor and definitely weighing on my lack of knowledge, is that most of the organs in the game seem to provide minimal benefit if any at all. This could change later in the game, perhaps the slight pushes in either direction will affect the outcome of a run, and I can't currently say if that's true or not. If I were to give this game an honest rating, I'd give it 6.5/10. It's decent and fun, and I will definitely be playing every other day, but I will always hold a small resentment for it in my heart for the cheap deaths it often presents me with.",

            "review_text": "Deathstate is a good idea, but suffers from being a bit too relient on it's insperations-nothing feels new, despite the interesting mechanic of power-up via stuffing yourself with alien organs. Not the worst, but never does anything that great either. Getting a ton of lasers and not needing to aim is pretty satisfying, though.  But the lasers are actually another problem with Deathstate: there is no balence. Some items are practically required, and others are completely worthless. Every run feels more or less the same with different characters because you'll be hunting for the same items. There's no diversity, and no real challenge. Doing good or bad depends entirely on what items you get. That's just not fun.  Hard mode feels impossible to get past even a single stage. Stonewalls repeat play, but maybe that's for the best.",

While there are plenty of top down shooters that require you to move, dodge and shoot comfortably within a control scheme, Deathstate has taken it upon itself to automate the shooting bit for you. I guess ultimately that makes it 2/3rds as engaging as all teh other games I've grown to love / would prefer to play. maybe I'll grow to love it, but as of yet, not so much.",
