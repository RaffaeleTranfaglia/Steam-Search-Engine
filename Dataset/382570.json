            "review_text": "No, I don't recommend this game. Quite possibly the only thing good about this game is the music and the main character design- and perhaps how it forces the player to explore and learn the ropes of the game, but it doesn't explain ANYTHING to you, the only brief explanations you get in a sentence or two in the start about how to jump and change the camera a bit, and maybe how to use the powerups you get throughout the game. When fighting mobs, I wasn't sure if I was ever even doing damage, and I'm still not sure- even though one of the items you can pick up is a sword. The physics of this game are wonky, and the jump is odd as you can get to areas you're clearly not supposed to get to without an item once you get certain powerups. I would not find it surprising if someone had to watch a guide on how to do a few of the puzzles, as some of them are quite bizarre, like the one with the spear and the plant. The character doesn't really match in with the areas, which is okay, I wasn't too picky about it. The platforming is terrible in this game, to be honest... The camera never wants to show you exactly what you need to jump to next- and you need to jump quickly in some areas, and the platforms always move too quickly, meaning you need to have a fast reaction speed or alot of patience, becuase you will end up doing the same things multiple times. 5.5/10, a decent way to spend an hour or two of time if you don't mind getting scared by loud noises in the first three minutes of the game. Would only buy it if it's on a huge sale.",

It boggles the mind what some people think constitutes a commercial quality video game these days...",
