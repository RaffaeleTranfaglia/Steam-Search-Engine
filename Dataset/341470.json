            "review_text": "Loot Hunter falls into one of those unfortunate situations of being a potentially excellent game that lost its way.  You play as a ship tasked with exploring the area and completing challenges for local towns. You gain gold and experience by completing quests and fights, and can profit further by selling your loot. When you've got enough gold, you can buy a new ship (not upgrade, mind you - it's a completely new ship). Quest, fight, trade, grind, buy a new ship, rinse, and repeat.  If Loot Hunter had more content, I honestly think it would be a lot of fun. The problem is that after buying your first ship, you start to realize how nothing is changing and you've got a long and boring grind ahead of you if you want to complete the challenges.     Gold income does not keep up with leveling, resulting in tons of grinding.    Map is tiny, and after the first 10 minutes there's nothing new to see.    Quests are repetitive, uninteresting (deliver, gather, and fight).    Content is basically non-existant (very few item upgrades).    'Fight puzzle' never changes; same mini-game over and over.    Zero challenge; redoing a fight yeilds potentially weaker enemies (i.e. no bosses).    Only goals are buying new ships (of which there are few) and finishing achievements.    Quests occasionally break (bringing 'x' of an item won't allow a turn-in).   If the developers had spent more time adding more content, new challenges, allowing ship customization, and a number of other 'small-but-significant' improvements, I have no doubt Loot Hunter would pull a crowd. Sadly, the flame dies in about an hour leaving you disappointed.  Not recommended.",
