            "review_text": "horrible game. it bugs out when travelling back through completed quest areas. it has an extremely basic skills tree/char development and plot. items are also very bland/generic with only 3 lines of modifiers and is no where near as detailed/varied as the diablo series. the graphics/animation and controls are also poor. its easy to get lost during each quest because theres no minimap (or any kind of map). stay away, they're better free games on the internet.   I'd rate this a 3/10.. closer to a FREE flash game than a $20 game.",

Missing text. Horrible controls. Difficulty that laughable at one point and menacingly cruel in a couple of screens. Constant crushes. Think about any bad video game thing and I can bet Legends of Persia has it! This not a game. Alpha version as I can call it. Avoid it at any cost. You've been warned.",

            "review_text": "Recommendation - Only for the most rabid of ARPG fan with NOTHING else to play.  Whether you trust game critics or metacritic user scores or not, it says something about a game when not only are almost all the reviews for it negative, but only 2 of the positive ones have an hour hour play time. Seriously, go check out the reviews here in the community hub. Only TWO of them played the game for more than an hour. Odd, since you would think people that enjoyed the game would actually play it, right?  This review will be short, since this game is not even worth the time it would take to write a detailed review.  Put simply, everything about this game is sub-par. Graphics, sound, voice acting, cutscenes, animations, combat, load times, and even translation. There is nothing in this game at all that hasn't been done a hundred percent better (at least) by just about every other ARPG out there, often simultaneously.  Play Van Helsing 1/2 first. Play Torchlight 2 first. Play Grim Dawn first. Play Path of Exile first. Play Diablo 3 first. Sweet merciful LORD, play Torchlight 1 or Diablo 1/2 or Titan Quest or any other PC ARPG first. If you have old consoles, play Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance or Champions of Norrath first. If you have a PSP/Vita, play Dungeon Siege 2: Throne of Agony or either of the Untold Legends games first.  Play EVERY other game first. I got this game for about $0.20 in a bundle deal, and I can say I wouldn't play it even if it were free. It's not HORRIBLE (it... KINDA is...), but literally every other ARPG I have played in the past 5+ years has been more enjoyable, and we are not starved for choice in this day and age.",

            "review_text": "Where to begin. Oh boy. When i bought this game i thought to myself, hmmm this looks like a fun game. The screenshots look nice, it has RPG, Action, Indie, Adventure tags. What could go wrong? Everything. I am not a person who goes for graphic looks, they are the last thing i look in a game, but this game . . . this game. So much bugs. So much crashing and crashing and crashing and . . . did i mention crashing. The minor things like enemy names with underscores, enemy names ending with numbers like 'zombie_lvl2_197' or something like that. Desynced cutscenes and constant crashes. Inventory bugs, like items randomly unequipping from a character slot, not being able to equip items at all and then crashing. Did i mention this game crashes. I really want to finish this game i really do. But it looks like the game does not want to be finished. The price tag for this game 19.99 Euros is ridiculous when the game is at the state it is now. I would understand if this was early access or alpha or beta. But this game is a finished product that . . . oh i hope i mentioned it before, CRASHES all the time. Until this game gets fixed i can't personally recommend this game to anyone.",

Unfortunately, the game itself is clunky and frustrating. Picking up gold and items is a chore. The cutscenes are boring and drawn out. Upgrading skills doesn't work well and trying to equip items is painful at best. This game needs a total overhaul, because it feels buggy and unfinished. Don't bother with this game.",
