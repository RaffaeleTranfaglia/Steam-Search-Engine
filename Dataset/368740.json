            "review_text": "Look.  People are saying stuff about the camera and whatnot (maybe the controls.) But it's a party game. The camera HAS to be like that.  Sure, It can be annoying. But that's how it has to work. Splitscreen is annoying, and this game is good for parties.  Oh yeah the music and the levels are great. I can't wait til this game takes off.  EDIT: i'm making this a progressive review. If you aren't sure about buying this, this review is probably your resort. So, read along, buyer.  2/29/16: You'd think that 16 players in one game will be horrible. No WAY! the bots are fun to play with in 16 person mode! It's mayhem (in a good way)!  1/3/16: The music isn't repeatative. The racers are unique. Gosh, i still love this game. I just played some of the same map for a while. Didn't notice!  3/3/16 A match daily is like an energy booster. 10/10",

Then you have a game that a bunch pof people can play together, whether or not they are experienced players.  Fun concept, but it is hard to control the character and it gets very confusing when there are above about 6 racers.   in other words, if you are looking to play this game drunk with your bunch of friends who vary in gaming skill, dotnt get this one.",

Your cart pretty much just flies around getting knocked off the map and it's really difficult to actually see your car in the first seconds, because it's so messy :D",
