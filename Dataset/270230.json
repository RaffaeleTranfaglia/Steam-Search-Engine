            "review_text": "This is an outstanding game, and I do recommend this game for those who are fans of point and click adventures like Myst, and a double -must have- if you love sci-fi/space ship environments. There are some amazing surprise events along the way, and I found myself saving often, hoping for easy replay of those events that just have that-oh wow i want to see that again- factor. The extra saves have been super helpful as I am still back tracking trying to get all the achievements. Some of the puzzles are really challenging (for me) so the best advice I have is don't give up! Because when you finally get that 'Eureka!' moment &amp; solve it, the reward is worth the effort and probably why you like this genre' to begin with :)",

            "review_text": "Liked this game a lot. It's easy to ruin a point and click adventure game (unfortunately), but this one pretty much nails it. Reminds me of what the best point and click games of the late nineties had to offer (think of the Myst series, 7th Guest, 11th Hour, Journeyman Project series etc.). It has good looking graphics, an interesting story that's slowly revealed, an intuitive interface and well integrated puzzles. None of those - I guess I'll just lock my safe with a sliding puzzle - type of puzzles. And also no puzzles that require some heavy lateral thinking in many, many complex steps (remember the puzzles from Day of the Tentacle or Monkey Island?). Some achievements can be tricky to get, but they are fun to find and there's plenty of hints in the forum. I've encountered no bugs, no glitches and no crashes, so the ones that have contributed to the negative reviews have aparantly been fixed. I'm also very glad they included the momentum slider. When I first started to play the game I felt seasick and had trouble clicking things until I turned the momentum WAY down. The only other negatives I can think of is the fact that the enhanced view mode you receive later on in the game has to be actived with the F2 key, which is all way on top of the keyboard. It would have been nice if it had been bound to either the space bar, the middle mouse button or if you could have turned this mode on and off from the inventory screen. Also the cursor changes to an upwards pointing arrow when you can climb up or down a ladder or something similar. It confused me several times having to click with an upwards pointing arrow in order to move down, but I got used to it in the end. Some of the screens could've done with a bit more animation, especially the one in the cockpit. But these are minor irritations which only serves to indicate that there is very little room for improvement. Bottom line: If you like scifi themed point and click adventure games, get this, you won't be disappointed. And even if you're not a fan of scifi themed games you might still enjoy it because it is well made.",

            "review_text": "An excellent point &amp; click adventure game with an interface similar to 'Scratches.'   The majority of the puzzles and story progression are extremely organic and very well done. Making progress is challenging but fair.   The story is good too, but contains a single strong problem. You gradually solve the mystery of what two major disasters were. That part is great. But one of them is not explained AT ALL. You don't really notice this as a problem until after you complete the game. Once you do, and once you think about it, there's definitely a piece of the story still missing.  Still absolutely worth playing if you're a fan of the genre. Solid reccomend.",

            "review_text": "You awake in a sickbay with no one around, and no memory of how you got there. You try to the door to the hallway only to find that it is locked, and you have a bad feeling that something must have happened. In this sci-fi point and click adventure you will have to be on the look out for tools and items that will aid you in your mission to find out what is going on, who you are, and where everyone is.  Here's the thing about Prominence, its got a good thriller of a story, something that keeps you guessing about who you are, and the fate of the entire crew as you find your way into more and more rooms. This game is going to give you serious fits of nostalgia for point and click adventure games as 90% of the time you are going to be using JUST the mouse to navigate, active, and use items in the game.  Now that sounds like a good old experience, but for some reason the developers missed the mark. I think the issue might be that anyone who was playtesting this game was probably playing it since early on so some of the not so clear pieces of the game weren't an issue because they learned through repetition. My main issue is that nothing in this game is really clear, at all. The biggest issue from the olden days of Point and Clicks is that it was 2D so you had a finite space to look for things as you scroll from left to right, or up and down. This game is from the first person perspective and what you are looking for can be ANYWHERE in your range of view. The developer also did not make any of the items easily spotable, which is evident from the fact that it took 35 minutes of the game to find the first item I needed, and to be honest that mechanic, the finding of items and tools, doesn't get any better.  I do understand that many of the point and clicks of today have some serious hand holding going on, but this game constantly felt like you had to find random items while blindfolded and only being able to feel around with 3 of your toes. There are some instances in the game where you want to slowly move your mouse over the entire object in order to be able to collect it, there are other instances where the item is so small or blends in really well, or is used in a manner that you have no idea why that works.  There's also the fact that during the brief, ineffective, tutorials that you will have no idea what is going on. Here's the prime example, with the right mouse button you are able to open your inventory, but at no time is it pointed out to you that there are tabs at the top of the screen, and what they will be used for. I spent a huge amount of time freaking out because of new functionality I've gained, but I had no idea how to gain access to the stuff I now had access to. I know I'm vague on this, but I don't want to give too much away, and if you play the game it will become apparently about what I'm talking about.  Another issue that I have with the game is the objectives, could you get any vaguer with some of them, I became so lost in this game that I had to result to watching someone's walkthrough of the game so that I could get back on track. There's also supposed to be multiple endings, but I'm going to warn you right now, the objectives will only lead to ONE of those.  The interesting thing about this game is that taking out the lack of being able to really play this game without feeling completely lost, or frustrated to the point that you want to throw something, this is a good game. I liked the story, I liked the setting, I liked the feel of uncertainty as I try to learn what happened, and what my character is capable, but at the end of the day, when a game has something that is really this big of an obstacle to play, this game will sadly have to go down as a miss. This game gets a 5.2 out of 10.",
