            "review_text": "Honestly, I wasn't expecting to get hooked on this game from the get go.  It reminds me in some way of Hand of Fate, another brilliant rogue-lite with cards and lots of fighting, but less mean to the player. HoF could really mess you up with one or two bad draws, while FS allows you to overcome even the toughest challenges by your own skills. Mind you, this game gets difficult very fast, as even the first major boss can really kick your behind if you don't pack some good cards. You'll die a lot, but that is expected with games like this one.  As for the deckbuilding part, it borrows some bits from Hearthstone. Your deck can contain 30 cards, up to 2 copies of each are allowed and mana curve goes up to 8 because that's how many arenas are in each ''dungeon''. The cards and heroes allow for varied play styles, so you can go full tank or DPS, or even play the rare cards that grant bonuses when your HP is low if you're in mood for risk with high rewards. The gameplay is very solid and you can really feel the weight of the punches and big spells, especially when lots of explosions happen and the screen ''thumps''.  All in all, a great game, that only lacks some sort of multiplayer and more character variety to become amazing. I see myself playing this for months to come. Well done, BetaDwarf!",

Good balance of difficulty allowing to have fun without removing the challenge aspect of a video game.  Collecting all the cards is pretty addictive, keeping the interest in doing Quests, and Online Dailys.  The recent addition of a badge system allows for replaying the campaigns with harder difficulty but better rewards.  Really solid game, something very rare nowadays in our era of Early Access and mainstream gameplay.  I'm pumped for some possible new cards and heroes, and I'm happy to have purchased this game, a low price for a really good content.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR is that -FORCED- : Showdown is a really good game with a ton of potential for growth. My advice? Pick it up and spread the word. Words, many of them (handle it), below.  NOTE: This review was written during the private beta period before launch, thanks to winning a code in a stream (Twitch's RockLeeSmile, to be specific) from the developer's launch event. As such, I am reviewing a game that I received for free, more or less, from the largesse of the devs. Feel free to take that into account.  I came into this game from a Polygon video review that didn't exactly show it off in the most flattering light (blame one of the worst members on Polygon's video team for that disfavor). From there I hit the Steam page and found the developers' unique little Twitch-fueled discount and giveaway pre-launch event. I found a streamer I recognized from YT and hopped in, expecting a decent Ziggurat / Isaac style arena roguelite with mild card-based elements. What I found was actually a slick, well-designed and visually exciting game with some serious chops on every level.   The world they're assembling is fun and interesting without being overwrought or ridiculous. The card mechanics go above and beyond the realm of 'feature' and into this being a true deckbuilder with serious depth. The actual gameplay is frantic, well-balanced, nicely paced and not too hard yet not too simple. The pre-launch event is a really clean and well-designed piece of work as opposed to a contrived ploy for attention, and it organically builds a community in a really smart way. If I had to bring up any downsides, it's one of the most fixable: In its current launch state, the game doesn't have enough variety in terms of enemies, levels, and especially bosses. Given the devs' update plans? I doubt that will be a problem for long.",

            "review_text": "It's like Heathstone and DotA had a roguelite baby! And it's a really awesome baby with fires and explosions and snake monsters!  To explain it as simply as I can, it's a series of condensed roguelite arenas using hero characters with a set of roughly 4 abilities (there are 4 available at the moment). At the beginning of the 8 floors in each arena you get the opportunity to play cards using mana. The card system works a lot like hearthstone: gain 1 total mana every turn/floor and get it refilled.  Characters start out with a pre-constructed deck, and with a currency you get for achievements in-game you can obtain a larger collection of the 150ish cards! Cards vary from consumable items to spells to upgrades that remain all the way to the end of the dungeon.  That about covers it. Some people seem to be experiencing crashes, but I've not experienced anything like that, so I can't comment. Just keep it in mind. Feel free to comment with any questions!",

First, it is bullet hell. Not too difficult at first, but there are a lot of things to do and it gets harder depending on the enhancements.  Second the card aspect is great. They make all the difference when playing and can save or hurt you. Its a bit difficult to get cards but that adds to the excitement to keep trying.   Third the characters are so different and fun to play with. Tip: GET the expansion. It's fun to go between distance and close combat.   And finally there are quests that will help you get higher and higher up. They'll had hp, gold, and other perks. Plenty to do.  I just hope they make co-op so i can play with friends. I'd definitely recommend this game if you like card games mixed with some bullet hell aspects",

            "review_text": "When I bought the first Forced game, I was hooked for many days. So naturally, when its sequel was announced I became very excited about it. However, my thirst was quenched quickly due to my expectations.  Don’t get me wrong, Forced Showdown certainly is an enjoyable game. It’s an arena brawler like its predecessor, and certainly provides a good – and fair – challenge. While it certainly can be hard at times, you won’t feel like the game cheated on you to raise the level. Everything can be dodged, and projectiles and explosion areas are indicated. And everything is fast-paced action. Bosses also provide for random effects throughout the area which you have to deal with, and from the second level they will also get cards to make things a lot harder.  The game has huge amounts of customizability with its trading cards, which you can use for building decks, which in turn you use to grow stronger throughout each level in an arena – though you lose it after beating the boss. It is random, so your plan won’t work out every time, and you won’t always get the cards you hope for – and with mana rising each level you might not be able to play a card for a few levels if you’re out of luck.  It’s replay value is high – due to multiple characters you can master, but also due to the enormous amounts of customizability you get by collecting cards and building your own decks. Also, when you grow more confident in your abilities, you can provide yourself with additional challenges – which you can choose yourself from a list you get provided by the game. There are also daily challenges, in which you can compete for the top score so that adds a lot of replay value too.  The graphics are ok. They serve their purpose of setting a more comical mood, but I don’t feel like they are really gorgeous or something. The sound, however, is really nice. Both the voice acting and the music set the tone really well for a fun experience.  Forced Showdown also has a few cons. The first that could be considered is the lack of checkpoints. You can spend a long time to hack your path through 9 arenas, but if you die you have to do everything over again, which can be a bit frustrating – especially when you die at the end. However, BetaDwarf has done a decent job in making it so that you don’t have to follow the exact path and fight the exact same enemies so it won’t feel as much of a grind. You also get gold after completing challenges for trading cards so your time wasn’t completely useless.  The game also relies heavily on grinding gold and cards. You get gold after arena’s, which you can trade into random prices (cards, shards, more gold…) for it. You can only own every card twice, so they get turned into shards too afterwards – for which you can buy cards you don’t own. Getting cards is very random, and you’ll find yourself playing a lot to get them. Maybe to get that one card that would make your deck complete, or maybe to get all of them. This is the part that can get quite annoying at times.  I’ve also encountered a lot of bugs, especially at the time the game was just released. I even dropped the game out of frustration because I was getting a lot of CTD’s during battles. However, most of them seemed to be patched and nowadays I haven’t encountered a CTD or a frozen game after I started playing again.  Now, for the things I long for when thinking of the first instalment of the franchise. Forced was a game that provided you with some basic puzzles throughout its arenas, which is one the reasons why I rate it above Showdown. Also, while you have customizable decks, you don’t get the customizable characters you had in Forced. With less and fixed abilities characters feel the same much more quickly, and decks aren't as reliable as abilities and passives due to their randomness. Card decks are quite fun, but I’m not sure it’s worth losing the ability and passive customization for. Maybe a combination of the two was possible, but maybe that would’ve made it a bit too complex.  And of course there is the multiplayer which Forced was famous for. This game would also be so much fun in a multiplayer setup. Lesser so because of the lack of puzzles but still a lot of fun. I certainly hope BetaDwarf will implement this in the future.  So in conclusion, this certainly is a game worth playing and I've enjoyed it quite a lot, but if you want to buy it because you've enjoyed Forced, you should be warned that Showdown is quite a different experience.",

I'm just hoping the game gets better and worth the money, but right now, it's not.  To sum up the game in today's 'gaming community': 'GIT GUUD' To sum it up in anyone with a braind's opinion: 'Really hard game' In my opinion: This game is ♥♥♥♥. RNG with what cards you get loses you more things than anything else. Whenever you manage one challenge there is another to beat you up with your own arm. There are also Hidden challenges in the later arenas so you can end up in a battle with things that will make your deck useless. GOOD LUCK!!!  So far the game has felt like: Too much Farming. Unfair due to card draws. Undeveloped Card game compared to certain card games. Some challenges are just too hard or a bit too challenging for what you get. Too few levels, bosses and choices. Goes from basic to hard too fast with little in-between, and most unlocks can only happen in the 'normal' campaign. Lacks some things like a quest-list to keep track of what you're trying to achieve and if you've failed or not, The multiplayer scene could be better, challenges are somewhat fun but wish I could play with someone. Too many cards to choose from with little choice in what you get from the 'lottery'. Rewards are low.  Yes it's mostly negative, and some things can be proof of something you love. If you like challenges and options, this may be a game for you. It feels unfinished however and it's good that it's new, because if the game stays for 20€ and is this short (Farming does NOT make a good game, only repetetive and this game does not have the right to be this repetetive). Lately I've also started to realise that after a few quests done in the 2nd campaign just go back to the first and farm gold, you'll earn a lot more, loose less and have a better time until you have every card in the game, because that's what it comes down to, farming farming farming without ever getting any permanent growth except for completed quests, some who have way too difficult conditions, some are too extreme too, 'use 150 consumables' doesn't work in the easy campaign.  So I hope to see some changes for the better and will update this review as it goes.",
