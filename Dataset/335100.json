    "description": "Dwarf Tower is a turn-based tactics game of tower building and spellcasting. Each turn you develop your tower by placing blocks, constructing rooms, and play various spells. Your tower can have Libraries (store spells), Crystals (generate mana), Dwarf Dwellings (give you dwarves to repair the tower) and some other rooms.",

            "review_text": "I love the music and artistic design, as they are very whimsical.   You play a mad dwarven mage, vexed by another of your kind who has had the audacity to blight your view with her or his tower on the hill just over yonder.   As your towers climb into the sky, you select kit to go into the rooms. This kit is either offensive or defensive in nature, and it will be used in your feud with the other dwarf who has decided to block your view with her or his phallic symbol, thrust erotically into the sky's tender loins. At some point, you begin casting spells, deploying rats and repairing your facility as your feud becomes a fight to the death, ending only when one tower or the other is toppled.  This game might also be read as a paen for two-dimensional urban planning.  Fun little game.",

            "review_text": "Potentionally a good game, but not ready for release yet.  Single player mode is completely boring. AI is terrible, hardly even attacks and the defense tends to be fairly obvious. I saw one person online once, started a game, and a couple turns in it the match reset, then froze up.   Some minor grievances with the view of your opponent. Its annoying have to look 'behind' my tower. The widescreen bars effect that pops up whenever you select a card is also annoying when your tower is more than a few levels. I don't need to see the description of every card's effects every single time forever! That only needs to be in tutorial.  With some further development, this could be a very fun, quick game. The idea is good, and the basic elements are good, but as is its less challenging and less stimulating than solitaire. I want to have enjoy it, but as is (in single player), it hardly matters what you do, you'll win.",

I really hope that the devs fix it or give a beta code to the old, unbroken version. The new features are nice but I need the ability to play multiplayer, the AI couldnt outwit a blind, one armed, one legged donkey on a large amount of drugs. Amazing game though, dont get me wrong, I just cant reccomend it right now.",

            "review_text": "A pretty bad game. Each turn the game randomly gives you blocks , rooms and spells to build your tower and destroy the enemy tower with. The explanation of how to play is unhelpful and it took me many games to figure it out. The way you randomly get certain items is frustrating as many times, for example, I ended up not getting a library for ages (needed to cast any spells) and the enemy just slowly killed me while I couldn't do anything. Once you do get the hang of the game, it's very easy as you only need to destroy one room of their tower to win, and... well it's just boring.  (Actual playtime 30-45~ mins)",

You're give random 'cards' which you can use to expand your base and arsenal, all while trying to maintain your fortress and crumble your opponent's. There's pretty great replay value with the random distribution of the cards. It's a good time killer. Do it.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: I can only recommend this game to people who want to play with their friends.  The game isn't entirely intuitive, so I recommend playing through the tutorial. Some card descriptions aren't clear, and I had to play the tutorial to fully understand them. Once I did, winning strategies became obvious, and it appears that the AI doesn't follow them closely or consistently, so it's easy to win every solo game.  Since it's really easy to beat the AI opponent every time, this game depends heavily on multiplayer. Online multiplayer looks pretty much dead, so you need a friend who's willing to play with you. If you have one, buy the two pack and you'll get your money's worth, even if you can't get it on discount.  There's an annoying UI bug currently that prevents you from seeing your attacks hit the enemy tower because when the view zooms in, your tower is still in the way. You can get around it by scrolling up with your mouse wheel (hope you have one!) to zoom in whenever the camera goes in to observe an attack.   I haven't been able to convince any of my friends to join me for a game yet, but I don't regret my purchase, so I won't say solo players should avoid it. Just don't expect a challenge without a human opponent.",

A great combination of both strategy and luck, with an incredible variety in how each game goes. You get given a set of cards each round to build with, along with spells and nasty things for your dwarves to get up to.  I've only played it a bit, but I'm looking forward to playing it heaps more.",
