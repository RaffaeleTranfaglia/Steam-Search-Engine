            "review_text": "I really didn't want to write this review. I'd been one of the more vocal people in the discussions, offering advice on bugs that needed fixing, as well as features I feel should be added/restored. I even emailed these directly to the dev team's preferred email address. I've been tough on the game, but I always hoped that the developers would prove me wrong, that they would update this game into something that humiliates Robot Arena 2.  But they instead released it out of Early Access in a buggy, unfinished state and we're approaching two months of not hearing a word from them, unless they are secretly building a big update I feel its safe to say the game is dead.  Lets go over just some of the issues.  Firstly, the physics are broken. Robot Arena 2 could have issues sometimes but firstly the game is 13 years old, and secondly they weren't as bad at this 2016 release. There was many a time when I would see robots take off seemingly into orbit from the smallest tap.  Secondly the glitches are everywhere. Bot building is broken, I don't have to have parts connect to anything and they will still work fine. I can have parts clipping into each other and the game sees no problem with this. When I play Robot Arena 2 they wouldn't let this happen.  Robot Arena 2 also wouldn't let me break the career mode, in Robot Arena 3 when it updated a robot that I had built was set to the U class, I cant edit the bot to change it and the tournaments it was in are now impossible to finish. I also found out after deleting a different robot that that one was in a tournament, making that one impossible to finish. Robot Arena 2 has a weight limit and doesn't let you delete robots that are in a tournament in career mode. Robot Arena 2 is 13 years older.  The game is way too loud, and the sound is overall a mess. No matter what I do to tinker with the sound it remains for me at the sound level of a Freddy Fazbear jump scare. Plus the game cant handle many sounds at once, I've had many times where because a lot was happening the music would cut out.  There is no weight to any attacks in this game, in Robot Arena 2 if I smash a battle axe down onto an opponent, it hits hard. It feels satisfying to destroy opponents that way, but in Robot Arena 3 the hits are far less satisfying, and weapons seem to snap off if you so much as breathe next to them.  The only thing I can truly say Robot Arena 3 has over Robot Arena 2 is in the customisation, and even then I'd recommend getting a modded copy of Robot Arena 2 for more tools to play with. They've had a lot of work put into them, and help to keep a 13 year old game fresh even today. (There is even an ongoing mod called the official robot wars mod, its worth checking out!). Also Robot Arena 3 does look better, but I would be disgusted if it didnt look better visually.  All in all, just look for a free download of Robot Arena 2, instead of paying £15 for this game. Its nowhere near finished and it likely never will be finished which is probably the most insulting thing, as they deemed this ready for a full release and took it out of early access. If things turn around I will update this review, but I'm not holding out for much hope.",
