Among the four of us we had collectively broken 100 hours within the first two weeks.  DOWNSIDE:  If you can't find friends to play, it can be hard to find a match with more than one opponent. Not enough Clans play and I feel people are really missing out.  UPSIDE: This game series is and always fun, and this game is no different. Clan Wars uses four different characters with different movement speeds and damage outputs, and you can have any combination you want... keeping things interesting. There's always new workshop content such as soundboards, worm outfits, and maps. Playing with friends is hilarious, especially when that one friend you have that is terrible at these games keeps accidentally committing suicide while parachuting or jetpacking. Alliances will be made, betrayed, and winning is always a curse. Half 3D maps are visually satisfying and destruction is... a 'blast' Dynamic water/Good weapon choice/physics objects Not strenuous on your pc  Overall, it's a great game and made better with friends. I've even considered buying extra copies to get more people playing, but my wallet disagrees...  Get it!",

Only thing I didn't like AT FIRST (meaning I do like it now) was the class based worms but they're not that hard to comprehend. Fat worm with more health more damage, small worm faster doesnt activate mines, genius worm heals and does genius ♥♥♥♥, and the default worm. Mindless violence, and strategic gameplay, probably good for anybody 12 and up.",

            "review_text": "Coming from Worms 2, this game has the two features I always wanted... dynamic water and non-destructible terrain. Unfortunately, Team17 is the dumbest game developer out there and simplified this game to death. There's only one kind of water generator and you can only have two on a map, not to mention they are huge and take up a lot of space. They also remove any terrain around them and can waste water particles filling up the space they inhabit. The rope physics might be technically more realistic, but feel terrible and clumsy compared to the W2 rope. The amount of worm customization is very limited. The level editor is clunky and does not allow for precision land design with it's weird 3D look that makes it hard to tell what is actual land and what is decorative land around the actual land. As I stated, the game is terribly simplified in options of customization. You can't make wooden beams fixed, nor make them indestructible. There are no door objects or other nifty things. The water generators are also succeptible to being blown up and cannot be made indestructible. You can't set things to float on water either. You can't set the bounciness of the terrain, or the gravity, or a dozen other options that they could have easily made available. Why? Because it was designed for consoles and ported to PC/MAC. I really really hate this design mentality. Why limit your game by stupid consoles? I love my PS3 but at least make an enhanced version of the game for PC/MAC. Team17 gets 1 star from me, for being a terrible, narrow-minded company. They could have added lots of game modes like real time combat, which would open the door for even more modes, like soccer, capture the flag, american football, etc. There's also no snow or ice, which is another example of their short sightedness. The snow theme was my favorite in Worms2. Basically, this is a decent game if you need your worms fix, but I'd recommend not buying it and teaching Team17 a lesson.",

My PC is a potato. I recognize that. But I can't understand how and why this game runs so poorly, particularly since the '3D' aspects of the game are quite tame. Input lag. Poor frame rates. Terrible optimizations. Even the cursor moves around on the selection menus with a delay, resulting in misclicks at every turn. I get that I can't run the latest AAA titles, but thereis no excuse for how terribly this game runs. This smacks of a terrible console port.  The new control configuration is also terrible. I don't really understand what was wrong with the original control setup. Someone decided to reinvent the wheel, and this new wheel does not roll.  This, like all other worms games that attempt to go 3D, is an unmitigated disaster. Worms is best in 2D and IMO it should stay that way.",

Also maps are littlebit bigger in clan wars.  One great addition to game is steam workshop where you can download and make own costumes to your worms and own SOUNDBANKS. That is probably one of the best things in whole game. Adding fun sounds to your worms. Example Arnold Schwarzenegger !  Ranked games are fun but unfortunately ranked system sucks. Sometimes you get pro players who have played over 300+ hours the game and sometimes who have played 2h. Meaning you have to check your opponent steam profile in order to play efficiently and kick those who have barely played the game so you dont waste your time... Im not sure how it works.    You can play online ranked games with one friend which means your team will be split to 2. Each player controlling 2  pros + clan matches + bigger maps + liquid water (also in revolution)  cons - ranked system is bad ",

The bots are completely useless! I don't know how many turn I have waited 45sec to see the AI doing nothing at all!  The games modes are seen and seen again and again. Nothing really new. They could have create new vs games with this awesome feature (the water) but I think they realized how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it was and did nothing with it...  Ho, and about the controls on a controller. Even this is totally wrong! The buttons mapping is totally TOTALLY NOT intuitive! I mean, jump with A? A?!! And fire with X? X?!!! That's the best way to mislead everyone!  The only good point is the story and the voice acting. It seams they spent all their money in it....   Anyway, I'm so disappointed with those games, I really miss the previous worms...

You take on the role of Charlie, a young nypmh who aspires nothing short of becoming the king of the world. Through your adventure you take on new party members like Crak, Muto and no one can ever forget the sassy Scarlet. You and your team of intrepid followers show new meaning to living underground. Through your journey you learn of the pain of war, the joy of life and the sorrow of death. Each of these scenes played out with a subtle brilliance that used to only be displayed in the silent films of years long past. This game has sexual violence and nipples. Shield your genitals.",

Never tried online-multiplayer and I don't plan on it either but if you have two or three friends to play with you will definitely have a good time.  Can't say it is a game to play for hours straight but those few matches, only lasting minutes, in between watching series and shooting ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s in csgo is something I've begun to look forward to. For its fullprice at 22eur I can't say it's worth for a cheap guy, but no person shall ever find this game boring.  If you have played any other worms games then you know what the deal is but I cant guarantee this one is the new ♥♥♥♥ since Armageddon. Really.  8/10 or smthn whereas the last 2pieces are missing due to poor(or hardmanipulated) settings and graphicbugs without understanding.",

It's not amazingly optimised truth be told but it makes up for it with a Campaign that teaches you about all those weapons you never really knew what the hell they did.   If you're on the fence, I'd say go for it.",
