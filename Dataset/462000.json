However, it would be nice with a cleaner background when challenging other users, a bit hard to see the chaperon system when playing and moving around. To Much flashing graphics around the play area, would be great if there was a minimal vector grapic setup for seriously online competitions, that could selectable. To broadcast it for live competitions!  /J",

This is a game I keep coming back to. It's awesome when you are able to keep 4 o 5 orbs going at the same time. I don't know why people keep compairing this to Holoball, they are completely different games (and I like this one more).",

The way the walls ripple when you hit them, the controller feedback and looks....just awesome ! Was not able to test the multiplayer part so the only thing I'm missing is a multiplayer lobby where you can see all active sessions and join one. Maybe with events at certain times and the ability to spectate a match ?  Anyway just the singplayer is worth the money.",

The developer seems to deliver the intended experience and does a good job of explaining how the game works.  Like most Vive compatible games, however, the replayability of this game is very low. Its good for about 10-15 minutes if I am playing alone or about an hour when playing with friends.  - 3 of 10 stars when compared to all other games, including AAA games not made for Vive/VR. - 6 of 10 stars when compared to all other Vive games (available today). - $5 recommended value if the game does not improve much beyond its current state as of 7/10/2016.",
