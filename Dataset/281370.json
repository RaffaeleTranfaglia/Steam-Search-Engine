            "review_text": "So seriously, I have not been spooked more in all of my life as I know it, no joke. It was REALLY scary. This game has been a very enjoyable thrill-vill ride of chaos, suspension, and candle-lighting. None in all my gaming career have I ever been faced with such challenging and promising puzzles. I think I can sleep easy now knowing that games like this exist purely to give us that special butterfly feeling in our tummys. Truly a standard the gaming industry should partake in. Why would you want to ever do micro-transactions like in Dead Space 3, when instead you can enjoy a good old-fashioned spooky transaction. Countries should learn a thing or two about this kind new currency that is currently only available in the pure spook of Real Horror Stories.™  This is a story about a man who is haunted by the visions of his dead daughter, boy, mother, and wife. It is revealed in the later-plot that they were killed by asphyixation, and dumped in the well by the protagonist. In response to the protagonist's evil doings, the massacred family strike a deal with the spirits of the forest, and, using their combined power, created a mystical labyrinth to test the protagonist. (Who we learn name's is Belial.) The spirits and the family design the rough, ardous challenges of tracing your cursor (Which we later learn is a satan conjuring wand.) through a difficult, poor-hitboxed maze made on purpose to test the protagonist's frustration of the hatred for his family. When the story finally comes to a climax, you must finish what you started by defeating Pudge, (From Dota 2) who frequently appears on your screen, and returning your wife to her watery grave. Then, you are left with a choice. The guru of stone is finally able to reach you, and presents you with both his hands.  This final epic climax demonstrates the deep moral choices of the protagonist. He must chose between his left hand, (the will of the few, since most people use their mouse (Satan Conjuring Wand) with their right hand.) and the right hand. (the will of the Protagonist, since most players would use their mouse (Satan Conjuring Wand) with their right hand.) If the Protagonist choses the left hand, he is released from his prison, and his family and the spirits are sealed in the well. If he choses the right, he choses his own selfish desires, and is doomed to endless fire and brimstone.   Endless Replay Value 10/10",

Want to demo the game on your browser? Try using google and you'll find it. The idea behind it is nice, but it is badly executed. Lack of clues to solve puzzles, one annoying puzzle that forces you to have great mouse control with lots of trial and error, a puzzle that requires you to memorize a word from a large text, etc.  The game's sounds are good, but become very repetitive if you take too long to finish a room. There are some very weird and disgusting scenarios that fit the game well. The jump scares can frighten some people, but they are overused and predictable, with a B-horror, funny effect.  I bought this because of the huge discount (75%) and because the game gives you cards, so I ended up paying a negligible price for the game after selling the 3 cards it gave me.  Unless you want this game's cards, stick to the free version, which never got some annoying endgame puzzles.",

            "review_text": "Welcome to the wild and wacky world of 'Real Horror Stories Ultimate Edition', AKA 'Cheap And Nasty Jump Scares And Insanely Illogical Puzzles: The Game'.    It's cheap...ooh, it's cheap. And it actually does manage to scare, if you turn off all the lights, put on some headphones, turn the volume up real loud and don't tire too easily of some spooky face zooming suddenly up at you from the middle of the screen approximately every 2.5 minutes of gameplay (something which does admittedly seem to work on yours truly again and again and again, but then again, I honestly do believe one of the scariest moments in cinema history is that shot in the Exorcist of the guy with the painted face suddenly bursting onto screen...so I may be somewhat biased here). And the puzzles...oh, the puzzles...I especially loved the one where you have to write 'Belial' in the tiled letters of a floor...everyone knows who Belial is, right? I personally just thought it was the ugly little round thing from Basket Case, but apparently he's also a world-famous demon...I really do need to read my bible more, apparently...   Which brings me to the next, er, curious point about this game. If you read the Steam Store page, you'll be under the impression this is a game about 'urban myths', and it does manage to keep up that particular thematic, more-or-less (possibly less, but let's not be pedantic), for at least the first quarter or so of 'gameplay' (note the inverted commas; they're not entirely accidental). But by the end we're seeing Popes on crosses in fiery barren landscapes, coaxing blood through lines carved into ancient Egyptian doors, and stabbing babies on altars just to see where the blood dribbles down to so we can solve the next puzzle. All 'urban myths', apparently. I don't know about you, but nothing cries out 'urban' more loudly to me than Egyptian tombs and desert landscapes.   In all seriousness, this is a rival for the 'worst' game I've ever played. Having said that, I still managed to enjoy it much, much more than many other games which are undeniably more aesthetically accomplished, not least of all on account of its stupidly short playing time and the generosity of the game-makers themselves in including a 'hints' section which all but tells you exactly what to do. AND it only cost me twenty cents, on super-sale. If it ever gets down to that low, low price ever again, I'd actually recommend you buy it. It does have some really nice imagery, which you can make some pretty groovy screenshots out of. The only downside to this is, in order to get said screenshots, you may actually have to play the game.  Verdict: 4/10 (for the pretty pictures and spooky sounds).",

Instead I was thrown into some random, not really connected sceneries that had to be 'mastered' by some few clicks (sometimes even clueless clicking did the trick...) and getting ahead was just too linear with extremely reduced possibilities.

But his thingy not only has no noticeable storyline(s) but IMHO also is - at least in Lvl 12, where I refused to take action and closed that game forever - just plain sick. :(  I'm free from religious 'no-no's and usually I love horror/creepy/scary adventures, but a game should be satisfying - like, e.g. those of Jonathan Boakes/darkling room &lt;3 - but this game?

In real life, I find myself poking things until they make a *slightly* different noise than before, and I get a jump-scare, usually in the form of police. Yep, that's Biggles' good ol' day-to-day.  The problem, you could say then, is that this game is TOO real. I don't want to be reminded of that time I played Simon Says to unlock a spooky door, or that time I hung out with a crucified Pope. Those were rough days!  Oh, or how about that time I could only progress by lighting an arbitrary pattern of candles? That Slayer concert didn't go well at ALL.  You see, this game, much like life, is a sequence of poorly-photoshopped flitered .png files. Occasionally, by which I mean literally twice, it does present a challenge with some logic and reasoning that you can sorta see if you squint hard enough and tilt your head and hold your breath nearly long enough to pass out. Too often though, the solution is simply to poke a random object MORE TIMES. While this happens more often in life than you'd think (ask your parents, kids), it's not exactly fun.  So, let's move onto word #2 of the title.  'Horror'. Horror, according to my handy pocket dictionary, means 'an intense feeling of fear, shock, or disgust'. Wow. I was disgusted pretty intensely when I learned the corner shop near my abode sells those awesome lollipops with the bubble gum inside for $0.25, the price I paid for this game. Those were a crucial part of my childhood, and a big part of why I'm a blubbery bear today. And I could have had that nostalgia trip instead of this game. Consider me horrified.  Word #3: Stories  As far as I can tell, this game's overall branching narrative was to throw some dude my girlfriend affectionately called 'YARRRLL' based on the noise he makes down a well. I don't know what the devs have against YARRRLL, but he seemed like a cool guy to me.  Word #4: Ultimate  This sure was as ultimate as a game about clicking things in the hopes they'll throw me some progress if I promise to stop is ever gonna be.  Word #5: Edition  Yep, this was an edition of the aforementioned game.  So that's 2/5 categories in which I was satisfied. Not good enough in today's cutthroat gaming industry.  For my $0.25-   You know what?  My heart's not in this anymore.  It's just not good, as you all already expected.  Go home.  Leave Biggles to his sadness. Could've had that blubber pop.  *sigh*",

After every step of every 'puzzle' something jumps at the screen or makes a noise. Well the 'puzzles' are also not really puzzles, most of them make totally no sense and one audio-puzzle runs so bad you mostly have to guess your way through. All in all you can clear the game in less then one hour, if you are lucky and guess the puzzles right.  I would say, if you are someone who likes to 'jump' due to sudden stuff and are easy to be scared, put on your headphones and have your fun. If you are not easily scared skip it totally.",

I've played this game for half an hour and for most of that time I was sitting, shouting at the screen to hurry the f*** up!!!!! There doesn't seem to be any kind of story or plot to follow it's just random 'scary' scenes that you waste time on waiting for something to glow so you can continue on since clicking the area before it glows does nothing at all! The scars aren't scary, the jump scares are predictable and you spend most of the game shouting at it to hurry up. I bought this game while it was on offer and I was STILL ROBBED!!! Very dissapointed with this poorly designed game. It sounded so promising.......",

There were a few cool puzzles, like the 'five demons in a circle' and the newspaper jigsaw, but most levels don't make too much sense. I think I click on a dead body to hear its squishy sound for like five minutes before the level changed for me to click on anything else. And there's a lot of things like that- click on this dead body until flies, spiders, blood, or a ghost jumps at you. And then the level is over, and now there's another body to click on.  Jump scares. They're a tool which can be used to make the game scarier... if you really think the player is off his or her guard at that point in the game. Here, it's how the player knows he or she spam clicked a rotting corpse enough times. Not very scary at all. There are better free games out there, so don't bother.",

Also there is one Simon Sez minigame and one extremely annoying Follow the Wire minigame. And that's it. Despite the name the game has absolutely no story. I can't be even angry at this game because it cost me only 20 cents and it's almost amusingly bad. The scary imagery is overblown so much it's completely ridiculous. The actions are so random that I've solved most puzzles just by clicking on everything without knowing what am I doing. Surprisingly such a simple game has some technical issues: Sometimes when I pressed ESC for the main menu it failed and just flashed from fullscreen to windowed and back. Also if you click too fast the same sound effects start playing over each other. I can hardly recommend this trash even for free. The only interesting thing about Real Horror Stories is: How the hell did it get on Steam?",

Gameplay consisters of clicking on objects in the enviorment until some happens (usually a jumpscare) that takes you to the next area. There are puzzles in the later stages of the game that may require a guide, but nothing too difficult. The game itself shouldn't take very long to complete. I beat it in less than half and hour.  I would not recommend this game unless you want something short and simple to film yourself reacting to for YouTube, and in that case I would recommend just play the free version.",
