It obviously took a lot of effort to create a game with such an intriguing concept as this with such an interesting art style that I don't see very often. The Puzzles are relatively simple if you have experience with puzzle games but for those who don't have that it experience it is much more of a challenge. It may be annoying to proceed in some aspects of the game but overall it is an interesting game that I would recommend to anyone that is interested in purchasing the game or anything remotely similar to it.",
