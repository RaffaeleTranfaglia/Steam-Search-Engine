            "review_text": "=THIS IS MY HONEST REVIEW, IM GOING TO BE POINTING OUT ALL THE GOOD AND BAD=  My friend bought this for me as a joke, and told me I had to play atleast one hour. That was actually kinda a problem, beacuse I was on the 2nd last level within 45 minutes.  Im not going to try to make this sound sweet, this game is short. Like, really short. Its also not scary at all. I love how the devs in the boss fight (If you can even call it that) Consistanly says, 'dis game is so scawwy!!' It drives me nuts. Anyone who says this game is scary is either a crazy 2 year old or a liar.  Any 'Difficulty' that is in this game is from an insane amount of spikes. There is the one level where it is literally COVERED with spikes wall to wall. With the first one, you cant walk off without getting hit by the spikes. Later, they place 2 unkillable enemies in the places where you need to walkthrough. Meaning, you have to wat about 20 seconds to lure them out, then run through. Any illusion of diffuliculty is from the devs overplacing the unkillable enemies or over usage of spikes.  The introduction of trampolines, late in the game, is completly unesscary. Its used well on one level, but then completly forgotten. However, the level it was used well, was actually an ok one.  As for the level design, its simply a 'Rinse and repeat' Cycle. Press a button, press another button, get a key, backtrack to the door, and leave. Or, sometimes you have to grab the spirit of some weird-looking doll thing, then bring it to a ghostly body of it, where it spins and explodes into stars. Not sure what was going through the devs mind at this point, but with a game like this I see they needed... Er... 'Creativity'  Everytime you hit an enemy, it goes slo-mo and zooms in. I mean EVERY TIME. In parts where you jump on many enemies heads, it gets quite annoying.  Now, despite all these flaws, I still oddly found myself having some fun with this game. I kinda enjoyed it, in an odd, twisted way. Do I think it is worth the base price? Goodness no! Do I think it could be worth it for some weird fun at around 50% off? For sure. If you can snag it at a cheap enough price, go for it! You might have a fun in some sense like I did.  There is about the most honest review written on this game.   Have a good one!  -SpyroMan27  ",

            "review_text": "The compelling story of a cat named well... the kitty doesn't have a name. But kitty has a mission : Save Penny (a human girl) and save pennies. Join kitty on an adventure saga of the ages. See her flushed down the toilet bowl, dodging ghoulish cats, slaying zombies, bats and mice. Watch kitty press levers, see an apperition of her dead mother, inspiring kitty to find penny(ies) and defeat the massive evil witch who has a lot more pennies than kitty. Will good triumph or will evil prevail, who will take all the pennies in the end? Those are the questions that had me biting my nails.   On a serious note:   Buy it on sale. It's on sale often. The game play is under an hour and there are about 17 levels. There's not much replay value unless you truly are invested in the plot and find Kitty's struggles inspiring. The controls could be infuriating at times but it's a fun little puzzle game.",

The fact that it is a mobile game is evident, but not too damaging. Developer seems to be a pretty cool guy. The game is funny, doesn't take itself too seriously and has decent platforming and puzzles. It's a little spooky, but mostly just silly. It's also pretty cheap.  Worth it for the humor and adorable kitties and cute noises and pennies.",

Most levels have a very linear approach. I beat it in under an hour, and spent more time waiting for the trading cards to come in than I did actually playing it. It isn't bug-free, and $2.99 is a bit much for this little. Though enjoyable, it lacks length and replay value. Worth it at discount, otherwise I give it a 'meh' out of ten.",
