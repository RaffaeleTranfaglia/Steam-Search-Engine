The variety of maps and battle situations is what makes Frontline so different and engaging: players are confronted with blitzkriegs, trench wars and dog fights, but also unusual situation such as missions...",

            "review_text": "Frontline: Road to Moscow is a turnbased operational level tactics game (which is how the developers classify it). In terms of complexity level, the developers claim it's 'Introduction', which I'll agree with. Everything is quite straight forward and easy to wrap your head around, even if you've not played any games like this before.  But is it a good introductory operational level game? Yes and no. It's easy enough to get into, and even someone who is new to these kinds of games will be able to play it almost instantly. It does not leave a good first impression though, with the early levels being rather boring. Chances are that unless you know that you like these kinds of games, you're unlikely to feel motivated to push through the first handful of levels. The later ones are a lot better though, and while the game never becomes great, they are still entertaining, and display a surprising amount of variety.  In terms of visuals, the game has a slightly cartoony look to it, which makes it feel a lot less dry than many other wargames on this scale. It's not for everyone, but I found it quite appealing. The sound is alright, there are a few different tracks playing in the background and they do the job well enough, but nothing stands out. The sound effects give you an idea of what's going on, but again does not stand out.  You only get to play as the German side, which is a shame because both the Germans &amp; Russians seem to be fully developed, and it should not have been very hard for them to make a few scenarios that lets you play as the Russians. On the other hand, there are a lot of levels for the Germans (30 in total). In terms of historical accuracy, the game is not on par with many of its competitors though, and while it gets the broad strokes right, the developers did some almost embarrassing mistakes, like placing cities in the wrong place on the level select screen, and the scenarios are 'inspired by historical events' at best. This is bound to annoy diehard WW2 history fans.  Overall, I cannot wholeheartedly recommend this game. It's by no means bad, but if you're looking for a great entry level wargame on this scale, take a look at Unity of Command. If you're looking for something more complex to sink your teeth into Panzer Corps is a better choice. Still, if you've played Unity of Command, and are looking for another simple game to pass some time with, or if you just want a wargame that you can jump right into, where you don't have to spend hours with the game just to learn the basics, Frontline: Road to Moscow is not a bad choice.",

            "review_text": "Ripper of a casual WWII-themed strategy title. I have payed 'Panzer General (I&amp;II)', 'Pacific General' and 'People's General'. Currently I own, and play 'Panzer Corps', 'Unity of Command', 'Battle Academy' and 'Panzer Tactics HD' ('Panzer Corps'/' Unity of Command' Ultra, Ultra Lite, if you like). If you are like me, these days into my fifties I am without without the passion (or time) for spening hours upon hours playing games as I did in my younger years (and I played all the seminbal titles on release), then you might want something casual, quickly resolved yet offering a challenge. It is taken that you at least have he basic understanding of how these games work, and how units are used to counter other units as there is no ttorial. There are helpful tootips offered throughout, but really the onjectives are obvious (the otional/secondary not - I just happen to fluke getting them). The way to capture them is obvious, if a gronard of strategy titles, or even with a mere understanding of Panzer General's workings. The gameplay is light and fun and you do get the sense of acconplishment after completing a battle. The animations are cool too, and better than 'Panzer Corps', which are aging badly. Without the complexity of 'Unity of Command' or the madly open maps of 'Panzer General' this is a top little title for when you need a strategy fix but do not have the time to get bogged down in details and large scale planning/maneuvering.",
