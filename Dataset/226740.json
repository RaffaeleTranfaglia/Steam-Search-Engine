You're born as a monster and the choices you ultimately decide generates what personality and appearance that you will develop as you go along with situations that happen in the game. ♥ You can choose to be friendly or ferocious, honest and kind, or clever, you could be a brave monster or afraid of anything that moves! ♥ The gameplay can be repetitive, but nice if you enjoy collecting stories or replaying for different outcomes. Overall I thought this was a charming game to play to relax and has a lot of amusing text to read as you create your own outcomes and story. ♥ If you like cartoons and decision making platform games that are not too complicated and you enjoy creating your own story outcomes, you will love Monster Loves You! and Monster Loves You! will Love You! too. :] ♥",

The result is that everything you do feels important, and with too much to do in a single play-thru the replayability factor is somewhat high. However, the game isn't long and multiple play-thrus--once you understand the format--can be accomplished in rapid succession and the game peters out.  Still, it has lovely graphics and makes for a few really fun rounds in a notably unique monster world and culture. While not being expansive it is highly detailed and definitely worth a look if you enjoy the pick-your-consequences genre.",

While not necessarily a very flashy or unique game, I found myself repeatedly going back to discover new endings and storylets. Overall, if you aren't a fan of games like The Walking Dead or No One Has To Die you probably won't find too much enjoyment here, but if you're looking for whimsically cute interactive story, I'd definantly give this one a shot.",

You begin as a tiny monsterling, and grow as the game progresses. Through childhood, into adulthood, and possibly even as a monster elder, you must make choices. Each choice alters your monster in some way, and lead up to several different endings based on how you choose to play. The writing is humorous at times, with you having to decide between truth or lies, fight or flight, and occasionally whether to help someone out...or just eat them and be done with it. The art style is something out of a toddler's story book, which fits surprisingly well with the game's design; and the story itself isn't very long, which makes it a great time filler.  The game is simple, easy to pick up, and family friendly. However if you don't enjoy point and click games, or the Create-Your-Own adventure style, then this probably isn't the game for you.",

There's not a lot here gameplay wise, as you might expect, but MLY is fairly well written, providing both some genuinely touching moments and some good laughs, and the art style, while somewhat limited, is pretty adorable. While it is unquestionably aimed towards children, it can appeal to everyone so long as they're willing to look past the cutesy demeanor.  At $10 USD, it's a bit overpriced; even with 14 different endings providing a fair bit of replay value, you'll still likely be able to see all there is to see in 4-6 hours at most.

Anyone who likes games like the yawhg &amp; long live the queen should get this. The game is beautiful and I very much enjoy the cartoony childish artstyle, it really gives a very cute feel to the game which accompanies the cute personalities of the other monsters. The writing is adorable and it really gives you a childish, nice and adorable vibe. Some of the adventures were very similar which made the game feels repetitive but it's still fun to re-play. , I wish there were more adventures were you simply interact with an item and don't do much conflict solving (similar to the red riding hood adventure). Over all the lore of the game was satisfying and easy to get and remember, the town of omen has nice rustic design and the mosters look cute and unique and almost a bit eerie, they remind me of monsters inc type monsters. I doubt they'll do updates in the future but I find the game very lacking in gameplay elements and wish they'd add more.    However ,for a 6.99 game it is very lacking in things to do, I think some stuff should be added:  - Love arc. Monsterlings are obviously not born via bang bang so love and relationships in this society would be pretty un-needed; However it would be a cute addition to the game and some of the other monsters I would love for my monster to have a relationship with. - Unique art for each monster. A lot of art is often reused for different character which makes it hard for me to remember names of who's who. There are about three different icons for the different monsters, so when they talk I am not sure who is who.  - Longer days for Monsterling and Adolescent phase. I wish I would have more time to shape the personality of my monster before I went off to being older. The game was the most fun as a monsterling because I really felt like i was making an imprint on my character. -More varying scenarios. The different situations you're put in are often very smiliar and you usually have three ways of solving it, via mischeif, fight or smarts. I wish there were more ways to solve a situation and more unique situations to solve. It all felt very repetetitve.  - Interactive backrounds. It would be fun if you could click in different places of the background and having a reaction. For example clicking on a vase and make it fall over and getting +1 cleverness or something.",

You will explore a world of monsterly delights. Will you live a life of kindness, sharing benevolence and healing with your fellow monsters? Are you an honest creature, to be trusted by your friends and elders by always telling the truth? Are you a nasty little monster, known by your fellows for intellect, for you tricks, your clever ideas, and wit? Or will you perhaps be known for you bravery, or your rage and ferocity, trusting in luck and skill to survive the harsh world outside of your monster village?  Whichever you choose, if you earn the respect of your fellow monsters and ascend to venerable Elder status, your life could even influence Human/Monster relations!

Whilst it’s easy to discount it as a child’s game, given it is based around a colourfully-lit interactive story, the truth is that the complexity of the narrative is as apparent or discreet as you allow it to be. You can take the time to think out your responses with an end goal in sight, or just haphazardly click on whatever sounds good at the time and get a result. With roots in storytelling and even text-based adventure games, Monster Loves You! is a charming and unique title that will take most gamers 30-45 minutes to play through, but getting all the endings will take more than a little thought and time.

You can be many sort of monster, you can be a bully that is solving his problems by smashing and fighting, or you can be a very kind monster that never lies, that is one of the very good things about monster loves you, there are so many choices!!!  About how long the game takes, i play the game in one hour, but it varies. If you read fast you can be faster but if you think about anything it wil take longer. The thing that makes monster loves you so good is that there are 14 endings and I am a person that wants to play all the endings. So if you think it out, 14x1 hour= 14 hours, but some endings are harder to get than others so is the ending where monsters and humans live happy together easier than the ending where you are a docter among humans (the docter ending is very hard!).  So my opinion is that this game is great and I think that everyone should play it!!!    ",

            "review_text": "If you recall the old 'Choose Your Own Adventure' or perhaps the 'White Wolf' game books from the '70's and '80's, then you're on the right track for this game.  After a few playthroughs, you'll probably start to recognize some of the options. This is partially offset by the fact that there appear to be more options that will appear in a single playthrough, and that you won't be able to ever pick all of the options every time either. The inclusion of Achievements and Cards give some added depth, but some of the Achievements appear to be based on failing in some scenarios so it's not always apparent what might need to be done for the Achievement Hunter.  The soundtrack is minimalist, but the solo accoustic guitar is pleasant and quite nice, and matches the style of the artist very well. A glaring omission, here, is the lack of a purchaseable soundtrack (at the time of this writing). The artwork is quite lovely, and the whimsical nature of it nicely matches the intent of the game. It is static, with only a few things that move -- mostly the clickable hotspots so that it's apparent what will actually give a response from the game -- but it feels like a callback to old adventure or even the old solely text-based games so I don't find that a bad thing.  The writing is excellent, though you'll most likely find yourself skipping some sectiions as the become more familiar. It may be a good game to play with your developing reader, though I highly recommend you play it a few times, yourself, as some of the game can wander to the dark or violent (You ARE a monster, after all.) and your mileage may vary as to what's appropriate for your own child.",

There isn't an ESRB rating, so I like to provide ones that are as close as possible to the rating system as I can make it. This game hovers between an E10 and a Teen. Normally, I would say E10 for Fantasy Violence, but some of the scenarios in the game are Teen oriented (for example, a monster has the choice to leave a young child and baby to supposedly perish in a burning building, and a few other such scenarios). Everything else is very lighthearted- there are just a few more mature elements for younger players.",

I would also like to say that well it is a great game, I don't think it is worth 10$, maybe more around 5$  Pros -Fast download -Stories are well written -Cheap(If you got it on sale)  Cons -Little Pricey(If you got it for the normal price) -The Icons are sometimes a little irelivant -Limited Replay value Over all I would give it a 7/10.

Monster Loves You is a 'choose your own adventure' version of the entire life cycle of a monster, from spawn to death or glory. The game poses many situations you must choose from a list of options to solve, each of which usually change one or more of your stats such as bravery, cleverness, or honesty. You also have an ongoing respect stat that affects how your monsterkind treat you and how likely they are to follow under your leadership. As a monster you undergo many phases of life all culminating with a large conflictual theme in the end that you must resolve.   Choose your own adventure, monster-style.",

You start your journey in a pool of goo, and from that slimy craddle to your comfy grave, you're confronted to numerous adventurous situations, in which you'll have to decide how you will react. Depending on your choices (presented as text options) you'll progress into branched mini-stories, receiving or losing points in a serie of traits like Bravery, Cleverness, Cruelty, Kindness and so forth.  From an adult perspective, the game might seem unchallenging and you'll really enjoy the last part, dedicated to politics and community management. But from a child perspective, the game offers alot of behaviors to explore, and to learn that choices have consequences - both in short and long term. And it's possible to be really really mean too - you're a monster after all and nobody will punish you for that.  The art is cartoony and childish (of course), and the langage proper to the young audience. Even if the total play time for a character's life is short (about an hour), it's possible to come back once in a while to have fun guiding another creature in the path you've chosen.",

The options vary and change for every new game, though i will admit getting achievements was more grinding through the game over and over and did get tiring after a while. A good thing about the game is its varied endings, there are the endings in which you choose to dissolve{though i'm afraid that once you've dissolved once the others are practically the same thing for the other traits} and endings where you ascend to elder status - these are actually a little different every time.  The other sneaky options and secret endings were quite fun to try and figure out though, the neurosurgeon one was pretty cool.  Tl;DR - MLY! Is a cute adventure story game and it has varied endings to go for, it has a repeatability factor too and the choices are randomly generated which changes things up a bit, overall a good game if you like that type of thing.",

However, the story-based games I purchase allow me to watch the story unravel as I play them. This story-based game is little more than a 'choose your own path' book with a few pictures. If I wanted a 'choose your own path' story with a few pictures, I'd purchase a book. It'd be cheaper and I could take it back to the bookstore for credit when I was finished.  On the other hand, however, the story was different and the perspective was fascinating. If you don't mind a game that's almost entirely text-based, by all means, purchase it. If you are expecting to actually see your monster develop and grow, you will be horribly disappointed. Its only saving grace for me was that I purchased it on sale and I lost very little in doing so.  I do not recommend this game unless you A) know what you are getting yourself into and B) don't mind paying the price for it.",

Sadly it´s pretty easy to see through and after a while one can just quit reading the question-box and just click on answers.  It´s cute in the beginning but I was bored after about 20 minutes. You just click on 'adventures' (which you do not have to search for, it´s always on the same position and visible by a big sign) and you can not move or interact with objects.  I mean, yeah I wanted a 'brain-off'-game to relax no action and not too much of thinking or complex riddles, but this is just too low and it does not give you (or at least me) any satisfaction.
