            "review_text": "Lost Legends is an easy and often-entertaining Hidden Object Game. It's fairly light on the objects, fairly busy on the simple puzzles, and pretty much without anything in the way of distracting challenges - but then, that’s common to the genre. I'd rate it middling-to-Yes - it's a trifle and zips by quickly, and most of it is pleasant or better.   The Day-of-the-Dead artwork is bright and busy and fun, and definitely a large part of what keeps the game so lively. The bonus chapter is an overlong foray into WTF-land that serves in part to illustrate how enjoyable the base game is.   In-game achievements here not only don’t translate to the out-game world, but also don’t let you go back after you've finished to search for collectible objects you might have missed. As this is the Collector’s Edition, we’re meant to be searching for transforming flowers and hidden golden skulls, 25 of each; on my first play-through I was missing 2 of the flowers and 8 or so skulls, but to go back and wrap up the stragglers I would have had to make a new profile and start from scratch. It was late, I was tired; the game ended up put to bed without being scoured for the missing hidden bits. Not the end of the world.",
