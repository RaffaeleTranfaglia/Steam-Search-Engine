            "review_text": "I bought this because it was a puzzle game and wanted something a little different.  Playing it I was unsure what to expect. Some indie titles at times add zombies following the age old notion of, 'if you want to make a game cooler and hip add Zombies!'  So it is with alot of surprise that i wish to say the use of them in this game is absolutely brilliant. The game looks to be a typical Unity style build (I could be wrong on that developer i would hope would let me know). The graphics are pretty clean and by default it first launched in a window mode.  However, that is not really a negative for this game. Its easily playable and the fact that the zombies will attack your people when they stand to long in a single place means you need a little strategy as you move to defeat them or the horde just continues to grow.  This is an extremely good Puzzle Game and my one complaint is that I do not have it on my iPhone 6.   With the price cuts and sales I would recommend to everyone... Buy this game!",

            "review_text": "“Puzzle game + Zombies = weird”, right? Yeah, that’s probably what the developers thought, too. So, paint your “Match 3” game of sorts a little bit different and it’ll sell, BECAUSE ZOMBIES!  But: While you can certainly replace the Zombies and Survivors with gems or fruits or whatnot and you’d have the same puzzle aspect, the Zombie-apocalypse atmosphere the designers created for ‘Containment’ can very well stand equal to other “serious” Zombie fiction.  It’s not your typical “Match 3” game as you have to surround the -- sometimes quite rapidly -- spreading Zombies with like-coloured Survivors, but if you like this type of puzzle game and/or can’t get enough of the living undead, get ‘Containment’ ASAP!",

            "review_text": "There really isn't anything deep about Containment, it's exactly what it looks like; kill zombies by swapping characters to surround them with survivors of a matching colour. While the levels get harder over time, they never get tremendously difficult, although I've only played the campaign mode so it may be different for the other mode.  Even though the game's really simple, I had a lot of fun with it. It is entertaining, and I like the attitude of the game; if I'd paid 15-20 dollars for it, I don't think there'd be enough to it for me to feel satisfied, but for $5 I was quite interested in the story, and it was a great way to spend a few hours.",

            "review_text": "An okay waste of time that's not exactly special, but is far better than it should be. It's heavily buggy given the number of crashes I experienced, but when I was actually playing I enjoyed the simplicity of the game. After I get deeper into the game, the 'puzzles,' become purely luck based in layout, especially once the zombie wizards made their way into the game. Yes, zombie wizards. There is a lot of charm in it, as flawed as some of the execution is.  Even with the frustration that is presented by the randomization, the game is still enjoyable, and tolerable at worst. The biggest crime the game commits the lack of keeping attention, but I may be in the minority between reviewers as some definitely got hit by the addictive bug with this. If you're looking for a nice twist on the classic match game, Containment does it pretty darn well. Definitely worth snagging on the cheap if you can for a few hours of fun.",

Unlike bejewelled and similar ' 3 in a row ' puzzle games Containment uses the idea of surrounding zombie type pieces with the defenders of the city to defeat and clear the area/game round .    Speed is a major factor as zombies will infect your people taking away pieces you need to make plays . Add to this special attacks in the forms of destructible surrounding , devastating grenades , snipers , bomber runs as just a few of the ways to fight back the ever growing zombie hordes .
