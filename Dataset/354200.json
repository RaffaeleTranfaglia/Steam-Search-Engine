            "review_text": "I love all these people with less than 1 hour of play time giving Aberoth or any other game a quick negative review. Such a shame that many Steam players are about instant gratification. That being said Aberoth isn't about instant gratification and there is very little in terms of hand holding.  TL,DR (basic of review, if you like Old School RPG's or stuff like Ultima Online Felucca with no hand holding or e-z mode then this games for you.)  Interactions with the few NPC's such as shop keepers and the banker are done through hitting, 'Enter' and typing out key words, such as 'Quest, Train, Skill, Yes, Vault' etc. Selling items? Right click on item to drop it on ground in the shop, left clicking items on shops floor purchases them if you have the funds. If not, the Shopkeep will tell you how much it costs.  I personally like the game due to its pretty much bare bones old school approach. Yes, people can pick up loot you drop or are dropped from mobs, even if they didn't hit/tag the mob. Just like in real life, some people can be tools, walk up to you and take something that you dropped that or even type in 'unfriendly' flag red and kill you. When you die from pvp or mobs you drop everything in your inventory that isn't 'engraved'.   Yes, you can engrave anything you have which will give it an 85% chance not to drop upon your death, so the danger of losing your nice long sword is still there. It just means you have to play smart, don't over extend and don't be a ♥♥♥♥ to other players by being a jerk or talking too much ♥♥♥♥...because they can and will kill you. And if you are a murderous scum bag red, when you die (if you've killed one too many players) you get sent to jail and cannot leave until you time out. Which can take hours or days. My friend decided to kill someone for a boss drop someone picked up, he was jailed for 1 day. :D  At the end of the day Aberoth isn't for everyone. If you like high res graphics, 3d environments, tons of interactive UI and NPC's with wordy story lines...then no, this game's not for you. That being said, the dev is a cool dude and the game is worth supporting so it'll keep developing. There are bumps for this game, don't get me wrong, like more items, private messaging, and a higher amount of mob spawn (especially for quest mobs) but those are minor if you look at the grand scheme of the game.",

            "review_text": "I wouldn't really recommend this game to anybody. The community in general seems to feel that being allowed to kill other players means that you should, at all times, kill anybody. There are seriously no safe zones at all. New players will always get killed repeatedly for no reason other than being new. You get no farther than the outside gates, and the guy that just killed you, is still waiting for you. This is a game where you lose experience points, and even get down-levelled from dying.   The shops are player stocked. Nobody sells anything. It's all hoarded. You can even see this clearly in the video on the store page. You can't even get health potions because the mobs that drop the ingredients have such a low drop rate that half an hour or more of straight farming yields nothing. Your only choice is to give in to being relentlessly player killed and hope that maybe someday you get a break. The quests quickly get hard enough that you will need a group to help you, once you get the first few finished. Nobody really helps anybody though, and the ones that try just get picked on even worse.   I encounter a lot of racial slurs, and name calling from people that were angry for not accepting a duel. People demand money from each other, after just being killed. Guilds feel they need to encourage player killing of new players, or just plain anybody they don't like. Many of these targets have said little or done nothing but fight back even a little. Your hard earned equipment, whether you just bought it from the shop, or actually got from a mob drop, is never going to be around for long. You can get your stuff engraved to avoid having it drop on death or someone sell it on you. If they want they can still just stash it away, or sell it to the 'black market' trader npc, though.  There isn't really anything hardcore about this game. There's just a bunch of senseless warmongers trying to display dominance over innocent folks that are trying to have a even the slightest bit of fun with this game, and right from the start. So no. Don't play this game. And especially don't get any membership. This game isn't worth anybody's time unless they started playing at launch, and want to ruin it for others.",

Extremely bad performance on computers that work great on things like say Space engineers. Very few meaningful items. Combat system that is worse than anything I have ever seen (pretty much hold said key until said creature or you dies). Perma death (not what i would suggest on a game this grindy).  Verdict. If you are looking for a game that will A. Make your face hurt, B. Make you go to Midkemia and go shake hands with a Moredhel, or C. Cast yourself into the fire, then this game is perfect for you. If not, go BUY a game instead of looking in the free to play area, I can personally suggest Mount and blade: Warband, it will run on even the most potato flavoured crisps.  2/10, would uninstall again  This is my first ever review so let me know what you thought by leaving a like or dislike below.

High levels mostly says: 'Go away or you are dead', 'Give the drop you just took or you are dead' or seen from others reviews 'Give money or you are dead'.   Once you don't do what they want, they will kill you everywhere where they could see you ( even in town - in bank, in shop or elsewhere ). In other words you are dead. 2 places where you can hide - vault ( which you need to create firstly ) or place near jail ( for few minutes ).  Thanks to player 'Sols' I'll not play this game. Else admins should create propper area where noobs will be safe. Atleast they could 'create' powerfull Guards which will guard safe areas. So that way noobs may have adventages over high lvl PK'ers just in one spot.  So for future players: Prepare to die a lot...",

Nothing at the lower levels has been unobtainable with a few dedicated hours of grinding. That being said, the leveling is starting to get much slower at ~20, but feels good and appropriate.

            "review_text": "Update: I've decided to rewriten my review as I may have slipped in a bunch of bias on it. I promise that this one (While still negative) will provide a legit standpoint as why I think this game isn't enjoyable.  The Short Review: Questionable design choices, the effort of a web-browser game and it's super unfriendlieness towards it's users at the start make Aberoth a hard recommendation.  When originally writing this review, I wanted to give the developr the benefit of the doubt and that for his first MMO it was an OK effort. But when I was writing the review, I was feeling agitated and incredibly mad at the game for it's rightful action to place a super strong enemy next to the starting area where newbies start out.  So let's start out with the Pros and Cons.  Pros: -For probably a first-time effort, it's clear that the developer 'tried'. I'm quoting this because I think the developer could had put more effort towards making the game at least present itself better and help players understand the core gameplay mechanics and objectives before sending them off to do whatever they please. -I honestly hate how the graphics look, seeing as how unappealing that kind of 'Retro' style has gotten after playing so many 'Hey, our game has retro graphics. Buy it!' indie titles. How ever, it's not a bad look and had a bit more effort been put into the game it would had reasonably been decent overall.  Cons: - Very questionable design choices.  It's very anti-user friendly UI and it's idea of restarting that of a roguelike doesn't make the game challenging, but more frustrating. The thing is, this isn't your typical roguelike, it's a MMO. There's nothing wrong with trying to implement permenant death in a MMO, (See Realm of the Mad God before it got screwed over by microtransactions) but it's definitely not right when players lose 20 minutes to hours of progress because they couldn't figure out how certain things work and when trying to experiment themselves get killed instantly. -Shops are so lazily done. Come on, what shop has you buy items by picking them up on the floor? It looks lazy. So lazy. --The UI doesn't need to be streamlined aka WOW and GW,  but it needs to make sense to the player and the player needs to be able to decide their actions properly.  This UI is text-based and for a MMO that takes lots of pleasure in wasting your time for grinding, it makes these actions absolutely painful to do. -There is no want for monetization as it's membership perks while sound devasatating are absolutely useless. Why not spend money on cosmetics, are other things that don't make the player OP but gives them something to improve their experience. -Seriously, what is up with this text-based UI? Quest Givers give out their messages below their nametag on the NPC and it's a bother when your own character is blocking the text. There is no window to view the quest message nor can you see it in some form of a chat window. So many things in the game are bound by the UI, and it's ridiculous. -PVP. And the fact that trolls can freely kill others for the sake of it. This is a big problem when it's happening in the earlier areas. -Like the infamous Sonic 06, this game loves taking pleasure in wasting people's time. I'm not saying this as a good thing, you spend your first few minutes of the game grinding by hunting rabbits and bees for gold.  First off, I'd like to let others know that just because I spent 20 minutes on Steam doesn't mean I played it on browser earlier (With hours logged in and with multiple attempts at trying to enjoy the game, which all ended abruptly by poor design choices). I've been told off by many that my complaints are unjustified because I'm the many that just logged in and bashed on it for the sake of circle jerking. Those reviews bring up legitimate concerns and it's ♥♥♥♥ing toxic when the community tells others who do have experience in the game to get out and play something else. What a joke of a community to see people saying that.  I'm being told that this game isn't supposed to hold my hand and that I'm spoiled by modern games for easy tutorials. There is a difference between a game with poor design choices preventing the player from making their own indidvidual decisions and a difference where the game is not holding your hand. Games that leave you to yourself are games that don't leave out basic and unhelpful tutorials, or unitutive UI, or poor shops, or cheap enemies. They're games that start you off with basic knowledge and let you free with the tools to play well. Aberoth demands players to figure out tons of things for themselves without properly teaching how combaat works, or how the basic mechanics of the game work. It can let the player off after teaching that but this is the difference between character action games and MMORPGs. MMORPGs usually ease the player into the tutorial so they can later learn how to create divisive builds and handle combat tactically when they get towards the end game and throughout that journey has learned new skills and faced new challenges.  First impressions are everything. If a game doesn't somewhat hook you or want you to play the game after 5-20 minutes, then you know something is wrong.  This game isn't what I consider good. It's not worthy of being on Steam, espicially since that Steam games have a bit higher standards. The quality of games that go on the store can be a bit low (Get out of here, Digital Homicide) but users on here demand for good quality games and Aberoth's poor effort towards presentation and questionable design decisions brings the negative reviews on here. For those who enjoy the game, it's better you know that Steam isn't a good place for games of this quality. This should had stayed Browser-based. This shouldn't had been released in a public storefront that was created by the people that defined PC games and video games as a whole in the 2000s.  I find it hard to recommend this game to anybody. I'm sorry, but that's the case for me, and a lot of others.",

This game is really great and special, It doesn't hold you hand, has nice pixelated graphics and has a lot of really cool features, for example, you can engage pvp practically anywhere just by typing 'unfriendly', there is no instanced dungeons and there's only one server, so things can get kind of wacky and crowded, but that's part of the fun. The biggest reason I think people dislike the game is the item loss on death, when you die you lose all your items and money on your person, this just teaches you that you need to play the game carefully and not run into areas where you aren't suited yet (running into the rogues den attacking rogues and theives with a club).  I'm going through the negative reviews and I've personally never had any lag with the game, and yes the game doesn't have much of a story, but honestly I never really thought about that until I read that negative review, seriously, who really reads the story from quests in MMO's, I know for myself personnally I spam through the dialog so I can go ahead and kill 10 dragons.  All in all, I think this game is very unique and I don't think anyone should take the advice of someone who only played it for a total of 8 minutes and gave up, anyway, good game, play it, my name is Syrillios in game, im out, pce suckas.",

This game has recieved many insulting and chances are, they were impatient about playing and hadn't tried to explore all of it and interact with everything around them. The people who are first interested this particular game were probably caught by the picture but they hadn't bothered to watch the video or see any of the pics in the game's page on Steam and just read the desricption. When you join the game, you're supposed to read the text in the bottom left as it will tell you what you need to know, however the game isn't supposed to exactly everything without a good reason. So finding the place where you get all the missions and equipment and such should be easy to find without in-game help, and the system of respawning and dying and having no character to go back to is because you have yet to complete the tutorial with the character you created and to save with that character and it tells you how to do this, you just have to pay attention to your environment. I'm no good at the game but I at least have respect for the developer and his attempt at trying to make a fun new game for gamers to play, explore, socialize and interact, and to just in the end, have fun!

There is no tutorial or any sort of guide to help you learn the controls, you just have to guess. Now lets move to your character/character customization, it is ♥♥♥♥, you can change your shirt, hair, and pants thats all. Now to the first quest after you leave the cave, you have to go down to a ladies hut. Once you reach the hut you must type 'champion' into your chat and then pay 1 gold to name and save your character. Now I get the quests and everything but ♥♥♥♥ing seriously, you have to pay in-game money to save and name your character. No other game does this for a very very specific reason, its ♥♥♥♥ing stupid, you shouldn't have to pay 1 gold, which isn't alot, but still to name your character. Lets move on to our UI, its terrible its insanly simple, which in some games is very good, but this game doesn't do one bit of making it seem simple but nice, its just text, nothing like a simple outline or any sort of decoration. When there are other players around you, lets say your friend or someone else, it shows on the top or side of the screen, which usually covers or just messes with the chat, which you use to preform commands or to answer npcs in quests. How hard is it to fricken move the names away from the chat or even better yet don't have the names. On to the settings of the game, they are nonexistent, when you launch the game there is a VERY small window for the game, but how hard is it to configure this or add a setting to change it. To save your character so your not ♥♥♥♥ed before logging off is to type 'save' into the chat... I doubt its that hard to add a autosave into the game so you don't have to manually type 'save' into the chat. The only good thing about this game is one thing, the uninstall works very simply, go to the game in your library right click and click 'delete local content' I highly recommend this uninstall for anyone who has installed this game.  TLDR: This game is ♥♥♥♥, but the uninstall works perfectly, so there is a good side!",

Most of the negative reviews invlove the pvp , permadeath, graphics, and grinding, but it doesn't really deserve this hate.    PvP in this game is a little brutal. At first it might seem impossible to get anywhere as you get killed and lose all your stuff. This doesn't always happen though. You have to work hard to have a fun time with it, and you won't go anywhere very fast alone. I made a lot of friends in this game, and that really helped but for the most part I've been playing solo. Ten minutes into the game I had already become a seperate class from the newbies thanks to some help from the community. Then I got killed.  Contrary to some peoples belief though, you don't lose everything when you die. There is a system known as engraving that gives you a high chance to keep items for a fraction of the items price. On the not-so-rare occasion that you do drop an engraved item there is a lost and found built into the game. I remember rage-quitting once because I lost my best weapon and some armor to an orc. A day later I decided to try to build back up, but once I checked the lost-and-found I found all of my items that I had lost. If some Idiot happens to steal your items you can kill him the get your items back, and most people will help you with this.  Graphics are pretty low-quality but it doesn't need to be any better. Everything is easilly identifiable and stands out vibrantly (unless your blind I guess).   Finally the grinding aspect. It's pretty rough. Some items like the blu bee shield, or a long sword take a long time to agquire. Like most problems in this game however this is solved with the help of a few friends (or an idiot trying to con you for a cheap price). Trading is also built into the game and is rather simple. With a rather large amount of gold or about two hours killing the same boss, most items are easy to get.   Honestly most of the problems mentioned in negative reviews would be solved if the played for another hour or if they checked the frickin' wiki. Literally everything is on there and it makes this game soo much more fun.  In a way I hope that this game doesn't get really popular because the community right now is full of dedicated, kind people. If it were to gain enough traction for the devs to get the money they deserve all of the lazy pieces of crap would ruin it for everyone else. I do recomend you play this game but only if your'e willing to spend some time on it, and not resort to being like the pkers this game used to be home to. ",
