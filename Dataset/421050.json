            "review_text": "The issue cannot be avoided; the question of whether many of you will purchase this game will hinge on whether it changes an ending you dislike. It is important, I think, for you to know it  does not  before you buy; that much is only fair. However, as a former member of the 'I hate that stupid ending!' camp, I strongly urge you to give  Deponia Doomsday  a play, as you will otherwise not only miss one of the best adventure games of this decade, but will forego a massive amount of story and character development that puts certain things in context -- and gives a whole new perspective on the shocking end of Rufus' saga as seen in  Goodbye Deponia .    Deponia Doomsday  is unquestionably the best Deponia game and most likely the best point-and-click in Daedelic's estimable library. Its puzzles are brilliant, walking the line between between transparent fairness and lunatic absurdity with unwavering perfection. It has a more spot-on translation than any Daedelic game to date, and considering how well-done many of their games are in that regard -- particularly the other Deponias -- that says a lot. As any veteran Elysian geneticist will assure you, it has the funniest gags in the whole series. It has more varied environments, more lavish animations and even more minigames than any previous Deponia or Daedalic game. I encountered no bugs, and this is surprising as even the best adventures (like all games) tend to have their share. What is most important, it has a terrific story, one so wonderfully, maniacally convoluted that it could be mistaken for a cracked Metal Gear Solid -- and looking beyond Poki's impressive feats of Kojima-esque plot engineering, it provides something truly vital for hardcore Deponia fans: a meatier build-up to, and greater rationale for, Rufus' ultimate decision in  Goodbye Deponia . It completely changed how I felt about the end of the previous game, and I consider that no small accomplishment.    Deponia Doomsday  is a stroke of genius; it's as good as the genre gets. I know that I will never get any new Rufus adventures, but I look forward to playing back through the series someday with the renewed appreciation that this amazing installment has granted me. Perhaps if we are lucky (and we stop bombarding Poki with our demands and thus burning him out on the whole thing), we will get to experience the world of Deponia through the eyes of some other character in the future, like Goal or maybe even Bozo. One can only hope!",

            "review_text": "6.5/10 Honestly, it was enjoyable to play another Deponia game, but it was the weakest of the four games. I was so excited when I saw that there was another game, so I finally bought it. While I'm glad that I played through it, it didn't have as much of the charm that the other games had, nor did it have as much of the familiar humor that made them so thoroughly playable. I'll admit, it became very tedious at times. I am not always the biggest fan when it comes to time travel games, and this one became overly tedious because I had to keep replaying certain scenes so many times through. It became very monotonous (Much like this review..?) If you've played the other three games, I would definitely recommend buying it, especially if it's on sale. However, DO NOT start with this one. There is also a lot of humor that will be lost on you if you haven't already played through the other games. Something that I did enjoy was how the creators of the game explained everything so thoroughly, and wrapped up the ending so nicely. Everything came together in that confusing- yet very descriptive, backwards cliche of a used kleenex type of ending you only get when Rufus is involved.   And yes, if you aren't annoyed yet, or haven't noticed, I tend to rate games that don't have their own ESRB rating, and do my best to remain as close to their rating system as possible. MATURE: Some Sexual Content/Brief Nudity, Suggestive/Sexual Dialogue, Language, Mild Violence. (In all honesty, the violence isn't anything more than a TEEN rating, it's more for the suggestive content and language that this earned a MATURE).",

From the intro to the dialogue's not-so-subtle hints, you could tell where it was going,    in a full circle that makes things even worse.     I can't say I enjoyed this game from start to finish. I enjoyed the start, felt my heart sink at the intro, and    crashed about as hard as Rufus when he hits the ground for the last time.     To anyone who wants a vague spoiler just highlight this final black bar as a warning before you consider this game.     DE doesn't do happy endings! Don't tempt fate.   ",

            "review_text": "As a fan of the previous three Deponia games. I have to encourage you to not buy this game. Aside from the game as a whole feeling rushed and lackluster, with bland writing and mind numbingly easy puzzles. The game as a whole feels like the developers got this game out as quickly as they could to get more money off of this popular franchise, and wrote it with pretentious writing that constantly makes jabs at fans who wanted to see more of Deponia.  Constant comments that border on: 'How dare you want more of these great games to play in? We'll show you, we'll make another game that makes you feel bad that you're playing it.'  Its hard to explain, but the characters constantly break the fourth wall mentioning how great the other games were, and how you, the player, is a terrible person for playing this one. It made me feel guilty for buying, and playing this game. But I kept playing, just to see if there was some light at the end of the tunnel, but there wasn't one. I won't spoil it, but the word 'disappointing' does not begin to describe it. I had a pit in my stomach of complete and utter disatisfaction after completing this game. I'm not sure if the developers had some personal problems to vent, or if they just believe there is no hope in this world in general, but that's how it felt like they feel when playing through this game.  All in all, if you're a fan of the Deponia series, or a fan of puzzle games in general, I would recommend you stick to the first three games in the series, and stay away from Deponia Doomsday. As for me, I can't even bring myself to look at the original three games, let alone play them again, this game has so soured my view of the original.  It does not continue the story, it doesn't change anything. It really has no reason to exsist at all. And in these games so well driven by their stories of failure and redemption, to have nothing at all be different or interesting just has the game as a whole fall flat. So I cannot on good conscience recommend this game that I so looked forward to, and was excited for.  If you're looking for a continuation of the Deponia story, or a good puzzle game, I'm sorry to say. There's none of that here.",

It really didn't give me that much....  The pros of this game: the fun puzzles, the beautiful art, the wonderful jokes and the absolutely amazing voice acting (some minor bugs here and there but nothing that ruined the gameplay). Rufus is the same lovely jerk and Goal is still her... well... clever, brave and funny yet kind of 'moody' self.   Now, the cons of this game:    the horrible ending that (if not even more than Goodbye Deponia) left me heartbroken   , the minor bugs (though hardly noticable in most cases and the lack of songs compared to the previous games.  I loved Deponia Doomsday's gameplay, believe me, but... to me it felt like this game was just an excuse for Daedalic to earn more money. Sure, most of us players begged for a new game to join the series but this?    I feel totally ripped off, honestly. I feel as if Daedalic just gave me the finger and tricked me into believing that this game somehow would be different, that this wouldn't end the same way as Goodbye Deponia did. In the intro we are told that this is indeed a tragedy and no matter what the ending can not be changed but.... I'm sure most people hoped for something more.     I enjoyed the game while it lasted and I have enjoyed the complete Deponia series but because of how it all turned out I will not be recomending this game. If you're looking for something better than Goodbye Deponia this is not the game for you. In the end it left me as heartbroken as I was after its predecessor and somehow I wished i hadn't spent all that time on the game. If you don't mind the ending it's an absolutely amazing game but if you're looking for something new... for something to change the fate of Rufus... well you're in the wrong place    Not only did Rufus die but also two years after his death Elysium comes crashing down in a sea of flames. His sacrifice was in the end all for nothing and that's what disappointed me the most about the game.     If you're looking for a change this is not the game for you. I'd recommend buying it on sale for 10$ but anything except that? No. The end isn't worth it.  Though if you are looking for something else and knowing it's a tragedy - I say go for it. I was disappointed but nonetheless it was a great game while it lasted. Daedalic know how to make these types of games - even though a lot of them end in tragedy.",

            "review_text": "Deponia Doomsday seems more like a long message from the Devs rather than a full blown sequel to Goodbye Deponia. It's still a lovely game though; filled with the same kind of humor a Deponia fan would come to expect from Daedalic. At the same time a Deponia fan should also come to expect the same type of bizzare and obscure puzzles from good-old Daedalic. There were a few puzzles that were annoying and required you to think in incredibly odd, abstract ways but they did nothing to dampen my enjoyment of the characters and story. Rufus is still Rufus, and Goal is still Goal for the most part. The new cast of characters joining our duo is small and while they aren't written badly, they don't leave as much of an impression as some of the older characters from the previous iterations. Some of these said older characters do have cameos as a result of the time travel storyline of this Deponia.   Unfortunately with the story being time travel based, there's good room for confusion and at the end of the game you may find yourself scratching your head while piecing things together. But there are no loop holes, no subplots that are dropped, no underdeveloped characters. Everything comes to a nice conclusion. But at that very conclusion you realize the very pointlessness of this entry. That no matter how much we disliked the ending we received, that it cannot be changed. However, there is still hope and a future that goes beyond such an ending. An unneeded but worthy entry into the Deponia franchise that any Daedlic fan will love.",

Be forewarned, if you were put off by the ending in Goodbye Deponia, dont expect this game to offer something completely different. Without spoiling things, there is no traditional happy ending in Deponia Doomsday. However, it does provide closure and makes Goodbye Deponia's ending seem much less adrupt.  In terms of the game mechanics itself, Deponia Doomsday often requires the player to use their brain to solve its puzzles. Some of these puzzles can be infuriating (I had to use a guide sometimes) because their solutions are disguised. What I mean by this is that your not always aware that you can interact with certain elements on the screen. This game and this series definitely require some patience.  Overall, If you like the other three games in the series, you will like Deponia Doomsday. The Deponia games have interesting characters, settings, humour and most importantly ideas that make them more than just your typical point n click game. They are certainly much better than their Metacritic score might indicate. Just make sure you play them in order.",

The art is beautiful and I enjoy the humor, but the game simply fails at very basic levels of story telling and adventure game design unlike the previous games.  In the previous three games, I felt part of the world and was interested to see what's on the other side of the junkpile. In Deponia Doomsday, time traveling completely ruins any sense of progression. You're randomly thrown into places to see what unfolds in that timeline, but none of this feels important at all. Right when you get to the climax of that scene, you just go through another portal to another random place. I no longer see interesting locations and characters, I'm just trying to identify the puzzle so I can move on in the game. I don't feel like I'm moving forward in the world or the story, I'm just getting random puzzles thrown at me.  This game tops the Deponia series with the most ridiculous puzzles. With point&amp;click adventure games, I understand some puzzles will not click for all people, and there were some bad apples in the original trilogy. But this game has already outdone all those three, at least for me. At one point, the solution is to literally go against the control scheme of all four games. You can't just, without any kind of hinting, make a puzzle that wants you to do something that each Deponia game tutorializes you not to do. They've also added weird QTE-styled puzzles, which I find completely unnecessary.  Deponia Doomsday is still a fine looking game, but it fails to continue the Deponia series. I find it worse than any of the previous three in pretty much every way. As many other fans, I was upset with the ending of the trilogy, but I don't know if this game helped in any way. In fact, it might have made things even worse.",

The gameplay and humor is exactly like the original trilogy. Rufus picks some random object up, says a joke, and uses it to solve puzzles. The puzzles are pretty good in this one. The only one I had a real hard time with was the star puzzle in the amusement park. It says you can't do something to it but you actually can.  I laughed a lot at the jokes. The new characters were cool, such as the time traveler McChronicle, alcoholic bum Tuck and the clown Pimpi the Pimp. The locations were interesting too.

            "review_text": "I played all the Deponia games and I really like them but this one is by far the weakest of them.  Many puzzles are totally constructed. Items are placed not because it would be natural for this item to be in that location but only to allow to have a presumably funny puzzle. The problem is that this leads to many puzzles where you have simply no idea why you are doing things until you find the starting point and things make sense. Also there are many situations where you cannot continue with a puzzle because something is missing although it is already clear what needs to be done. This also leads to situations where other items would totally work to solve a puzzle but instead you are expected to do something weird instead.  My biggest concern is also the whole time travelling plot. There are some neat situations with this so I do not want to be completely negative about this. But most of the time the whole time aspect is used in a very confusing way, for example when two solutions are obvious but you do not know which one belongs to the current time line and which you are expected to do. Also time travelling is not used for clever gameplay as it was in Day of the Tentacle but instead to construct a very confusing story which gets more confusing as you progress.  Towards the end I actually got really annoyed by it because the game fails to establish a clear story path that you are following and when you get used to one location you are sent to the next one. It is hard to really get into the game and you feel like being rushed through as much content as possible. A more laid back and focus progression would have been much better.

I don't want to spoil ;)  I played around 15 hours. I took my time to discover as much dialog as possible and of course I am not the best at adventues. Oh but by the way. If you are looking for a difficult game then Deponia is nothing for you but if you are looking for a good story, lovely characters and just a good time you found the right game.   I recommend playing the other three Deponia Games first. You can play this game without the background since they are telling the core story of the past games but trust me. It will be worth the money ;)",

After having a hard time to let go of the classics like Curse of Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle and other major classics I was afraid we'd never see any similar games in the near future. Little did I know that Deadalic would come along and create such masterpieces.  +Puzzles +Difficulty +Design +Voiceacting +Story  -Could be litte bit more humor in the dialog and characters for my taste -Main character sometimes becomes a bit TOO douchy/childish/unlikeable   9/10 in my book  Get it!",

I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone who didn't play the first three games but it is a must have for anyone who did. I liked the ending of this game more than the previous game and all in all the story has a proper conclusion. Wish it would go forever but even good things need to end. One negative point I would say is that you no longer get any singing between chapters that we got in the previous games.",

Would have liked to see more of that.  + A natural extension of the previous 3 games, which are some of my favorite adventure games. + Still love the art style. + Humorous story.  - Time travel is confusing. - Rufus is still a bit of a detestable character  Playtime: ~10h Enjoyment: 9/10",
