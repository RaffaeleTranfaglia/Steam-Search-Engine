Pros:  *Make the sex with hot scissoring action. *You can turn them around and crash them into each other head first. This also counts as doing a sex. *At the end of the game, a screen tells you how many times you've been known to have been involved in sex-doing-activities. * The plasticman sexmaking game is free.  Cons: *Steam overlay doesn't work so I don't have any screenshots of the doll sex. *Steam overlay doesn't work so I don't have screenshottable video game proof that I have probably done a sex.  Summary: Rename this game Do a Sex: Human Procreation.",

If you weren't a kid when Titanic came out, you miss out on half the joke, but it's still pretty hilarious to flail the dolls around wildly and get a message after about 30 seconds to a minute saying how many times you might have made the dolls have sex. Possibly. Perhaps.",

The objective of the game is simple you move your hands around and try to glitch the doll around to get the highest number of attempted sexual intercourse. What the game needs the most is a steam leaderboard so you can compete with your friends on love making. This game features : Immersive one minute sex simulator, educational material to get ready for the real deal, and hot content intended for those who have a fetish with barbie, monster high, or any other doll they masturbate to. I highly recommend it to the 8 year old call of duty players and single lonely gamers who claim on having sex with hot babes, and for regular kids like yourself who want to understand how sex works without searching up any porn.

(sexual intercourse)  she goes down to play with her flexible ken and barbie dolls, undresses them, and starts to push them together frantically in any way that you choose. (using the 'wasd' and 'j''k' keys) your goal is thought to be to control them into sexual intercourse as many times as possible without getting caught, and your score is displayed at the very end. it is a very touching story about a young girl learning how to do it, in the classic manner (with dolls) i hope you enjoy this game, for i know i learned a lot from it and found it very beautiful :')",

The creators place you in a mediocre home. one large window in the front of the home, an average couch, family portrait, lamp. And it begins with your mother, gazing at you in discontent. She sports a rather dull purple blouse and a navy blue skirt. The real story hits you hard at this point. She seems to dissipate into thin air, appearing to drive away in a what looks to be an Audi or Mini Cooper. The young girl watches, waits, stares, looks, observes, sees, and any synonym thereof. She then shyfully, makes her way to her dolls. One male, one female. This is where you, the player, take control of this delectable, ripe little girl. The choice is yours, you smash and rotate dolls in an increasingly curious rush to discover how you 'do it.' The blonde thinks of the sex scene in the Titanic and things her Mimi has told her.  So very fascinating.  Then, her mother returns, which makes you question where she went in the first place. You immediately throw down the dolls and turn around blushing. The game promptly ends and tells you how many times you have had sex.  This game has truly opened my eyes in terms of story writing. I implore you to play this game for a minimum of 24 hours to truly experience how great this game is. It baffles you how much you can learn.",

I support the need for Sexual Education, and I like when someone does something that supports it. If that was all there was, I would be fine with this 'game'. What bothers me is the winning a Indecade GAMES competition with something that flash video users embedded into websites 10 years ago. This is not the future of games, this is a huge throwback to the gaming scene. You want games as Art? Go play ICO or Flower, or see what real game art is and play a game that makes you thing and debate like Bioshock. There games industry is very diverse if you are willing to experience mutliple genres.   The content here is nothing more then a flash game. I am glad it was free, and I am in support of people that want to develop this... but it should never have been allowed to be called a game. There is no direction, no writing, no pacing, no leaderboards, no real score, no reply value. This is a joke to everyone expect a small group of people that believe games like this... should be allowed, and games like COD, Street Fighter, Bioshock, Assassin's Creed, you name it... should not be allowed.  I tested to see if the game has ANY 'gameplay' elements. How did it tally up the score at the end? Put the 2 dolls heads together and leave them there moving the s and w keys so it goes up and down... BAM 400 maybe sex? Its only about how long they touch, not how well they are setup, position or learning anything. This would never be rated as a game. This is a interactive Flash animation.  I played the game... all the way through... and it said I did not use the product long enough to write a review. (5 minutes) This is a 3 minute long 'game' that I had to play through 2 more times to get to 5 minuets played, and the time is not even based on my own ability or lack of, that is simply the TIME of the game.
