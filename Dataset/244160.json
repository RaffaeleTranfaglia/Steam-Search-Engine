It was very buggy and frustrating, with numerous other issues like HUGE pathing problems, stupid ai and automation problems (Several harvesters waiting to get to a single asteroid to harvest when they're surrounded by unnoccupied other ones). However, the largest problems lay in the fact that 'Homeworld 1 remastered' was essentially just homeworld 2 with homeworld 1 ships, because a lot of mechanics which gave the original tactical depth had to be removed so it could fit into homeworld 2's engine. This meant that the whole collection was a buggy, broken, imbalanced shadow of the originals.   But then the June 7th update happened",

The graphic update for the remastered version is something that all game developers should look at. If you want to relaunch a old game just update the graphics. Dont ruin the game by trying to add your own idea. But for me the crowing jewel for this game is the music. This game has music to sooth the savage beast. I played this game for hours at a time just to listen to the music. i was close to tears sometime when the music coinsided with some very dramitic game play.

            "review_text": "Hands down, one of the Best RTS Games of All Time.  And now that it finally has the ability to not only work properly on Modern Day OS'es, ALONG WITH Updated Gameplay, Remastered Graphics, Improved Multiplayer, etc.... AND the fact that I get both the Classic Versions AND the Remastered Versions of both HW1 &amp; HW2 in one?! Why the hell ANY FAN of this game in the past would turn this game away is just beyond my ♥♥♥♥!  The fact that we can now fight each other in Multiplayer with all 4 races from both the 1st and 2nd Homeworld Games is just absolutely fantastic. That was something I always wanted to do in the past, and now I can do so without mods! How could I possibly say 'No' to this game?!  However, there are some things to note. A lot of people have been complaining about some of the balance changes specifically regarding Frigates and Capital Ships. Primarily the fact that their HP has been DRASTICALLY nerfed since the originals. And unfortunately, I completely agree. I find this nerf to be very unnecessary and kinda makes capital ships and frigates to be a lot less useful as they used to be. Thankfully, however, there is a fix for this in the workshop. There is a mod called 'Remastered Re-Balanced' that is available to get in the Steam Workshop that fixes nearly Every Single Problem I have with the Rebalancing Changes that Gearbox made. If you wanna play this game and fix all the problems that are present with the Remastered Versions with Frigates and Captial Ships, along with many other things as well, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND getting that mod. It will make your game 10 times better. You have my assurance on that one.  Now with that said, some people are gonna be confused as to why Homeworld: Cataclysm was not included in the Remastered Collection. The reason behind this is because the Original Source Code of Homeworld Cataclysm is currently Missing. The original game developers of Cataclysm are long gone now. But Gearbox has said if anyone has any leads to where that Source Code may be, to report it to them immediately. But honesttly, it could also be said that it might just be easier to re-do the whole game from scratch at this point. But regardless, there's already a mod in the Workshop right now that allows you to play as the Somtaaw in HW2 Remastered. So that's definitely a start. But I still would have loved to play as The Beast again. Hopefully someone will make a mod of that too if Gearbox doesn't remaster Cataclysm.  But the bottom line here is this: This Game is a MASTERPIECE. If you love Sci-Fi RTS Games and if you love things like Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, Babylon 5, Mobile Suit Gundam, etc.... This game will MOST DEFINITELY be something to pick up.    .......What, are you still reading this? GO! Buy this game right now! Stop reading and do it! It's worth every single penny in your wallet that you spend on it! It's a Legendary Spart RTS, for Christ Sake! GO! NOW!",

            "review_text": "A few years ago I began searching for a space RTS. I found a game called Homeworld. Allthough I was unable to play the game due to it not being downloadable and the region I am in. So I played other games and kept Homeworld in the back of my mind.   Last week when i noticed it was coming to steam I jumped all over it. After playing Nexas Jupiter Incedent and the Sins series, I was left with a want of more. I wanted Sins openness of the skirmishes and the relaistic feel and look of Nexas.   My first hands on with HW was great. I love the viuals and its feels relistic too. The radio chatter is very good as well. The only issue for me is how the campaign is mission based (I would like a big galaxy to build my empire and live amoungst the others) so I tried skirmish. The maps are too small and really result in quick deathmathes in skirmishes. All the while I am still loving the game I just needed it to offer more freedom.   So I went looking for the perfect mod. I found Complex mod. Its exactly what I wass looking for and in my opinion makes the game what it should be and to me the best space game out there. Complex has a skirmish map that is 60000 km. Its basiclly a galaxy for you to skirimsh on. But its so big you have to use hyper space to travel long distances making it hard to be found and easy to disapear.   If you like space, rts games, and you feel u havnt found that game yet. This game migh just do for you what it has done for me.   I suggest using complex mod. It can only be used with classis HW2 for now, but you will not regret it. Remastered is great but with no mods to help me immerse myself into the galaxy, I will stick with HW2 classic for now.  My Verdict:  Visuals 9/10 Sound 10/10 Gameplay 10/10 Replay Value 9/10 Mods 10/10  9.5/10 without mods 10/10 with mods  Thanks for reading.",

            "review_text": "An excellent remake of an excellent game. The games hold up extremely well, even though the games are 16 and 12 years old. The devs reworked everything from the ground up as opposed to improving some textures like in most HD remakes. I finished the first campaign and played a few skirmish games and haven't encountered any bugs. The multiplayer is still in beta at this time since they are letting all the factions across both games play against each other, and things aren't balanced yet. There is a new UI and controls, mostly revamping the HW1 controls to make them more like HW2, and getting rid of refeuling for strikecraft in HW1. Ignore people that are complaining about this because it makes HW1 10x more playable. On the down side the formations from HW1, that were crucial to using strike craft don't work in the remastered version. Hopefully this will be fixed in a patch, but if you want a faithful HW1 experience the set includes both HW1 and 2 in their original untouched forms. Also I believe the campaign has gotten easier. I can't verify if this is because the game is simply easier or because I have played so much of it over the years.HW has a slower pace, so if you prefer 5 minute multiplayer matches HW might not be fore you. The story is very good, a rarity for a RTS, also the soundtrack and art is also amazing. The HW franchise was so ahead of its time that it is still innovative more than a decade on. No space based RTS has ever come close to besting it. The modding community has been active for the past 2 years for HW2 specifically, so you can expect a lot of mods comming out shortly. I wouldn't be surpirsed if HW: Remastered won many RTS of the year awards, like it did when it came out years ago. These games are a must play if you like RTSs or space based games.",

I start the game up and play 'Remastered' Homeworld 1.... all they did was use the Homeworld 2 engine and beef it up with mods, IT IS NOT Homeworld 1 the story is the same sure BUT the gameplay and the ships are all Homeworld 2, this is just a Buffed up Homeworld 2 mod nothing more.   Not saying its bad but I will say the 'Remastered' title is a BIT missleading. I still like Homeworld and this is STILL fun. They NEED to give the lan play back to this game so you can still do lan partys.  anywho good Homeworld 2 pack to have.  IF your a Purest then I don't recommend this game for you, BUT if your someone that likes homeworld and mod it or likes Big space battles this is a good game still.

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: I'm assuming a long-standing familiarity with the Homeworld series here, for anyone who reads this.   I'm very torn on this game. On one hand, I am a long-time fan of the Homeworld series of games. From the moment I'd played the original HW demo prior to the game's release, I was in love with the game. So much that over the years I've wound up with several copies of it so I could play with friends who didn't have their own at the time.  Fast forward past Homeworld: Cataclysm (since it's not in this collection), to Homeworld 2. I was still quite happy with the game, although I was not so impressed with the new game engine. Also, I was quite confused with some of the continuity errors introduced into the units. Why were capital ships no longer capable of jumping themselves, with the exception of ships that could build the hyperspace module? In HW 1, all frigates and up were jump-capable without support. Why were formations and tactics effectively non-existant? They played such a huge role in carrying out a successful combat action in the original. The list goes on.  So, here we are today, with the Homeworld Remastered Collection. As a lover of the series, I'm thrilled with its existence. From a collector's standpoint, this is a wonderful addition to the Homeworld Universe. It preserves the story and music from the original versions, and does indeed do a very nice job of updating the appearance of the setting.  Now, the gripes...  First off, they made subtle modifications to the classic version of Homeworld included in the collection. There is a queue-limit, restricting how many active build queues per mothership and carrier. Want to queue a whole mixed corvette wing at once? Nope, you can only build 2 types at once, regardless of how many of each. This continues on through to capitals ships. Also, they removed all capablity for multiplayer. There isn't even a LAN option. If LAN was still an option, through some network trickery people could still play multiplayer, even if there was no ability to just find and hop into a game like before the multiplayer lobby finally was shut down.  Regarding the multiplayer side of things in general, I've only tried one game over the beta system (well, beta as of this writing, anyway), and I was unimpressed. About 15 minutes in, just as my teammate and I finished fending off an initial assault from the other players (6 went in via lobby, 4 of us wound up in game), the game just up&amp;closes on me. No error, no crash message, nothing. Just back to my desktop.  Now, onto my gripes with the 'Remastered' version of Homeworld 1. In short, it's just a mod for the original Homeworld 2 engine (as 'improved' for the remastered version of HW2). Unit caps, insanely-decreased hangar capacity on the mothership, a queue that can only build 2 or 3 different things at a time per production ship, RUs required for research (and no parallel researching anymore, just one tech at a time no matter how many sections you build for the research ship), and otherwise the same failings of the Homeworld 2 engine that the original HW2 suffered from. Namely the joke they called tactics and formations. And the same, clunky&amp;screen cluttering interface (I loved the simplicity of the original HW's interface, it let me spend more time dealing with events in the gameplay, rather than trying to wrestle with which panel or convoluted 'shortcut' I needed).  As it stands now (and any patches/updates aside, will ultimately probably remain so), I really can't recommend the game collection. I really only bought it for the inclusion of 'Homeworld Classic,' and while mostly happy with that part of the collection, I still have some complaints about the changes made to the game.  Only get this if you have a similar love of the franchise as I do, otherwise you should save your money and look for something else to scratch your space RTS itch.",

I wont try to ice it over, this game has some aggrivating bugs at times, and I wouldnt recommend trying the multiplayer yet (or if you do prepare for some... 'fun'). I wish they left the first games mechanics how they were and not to implement the seconds into it. That way it would have kept its original feel.   Recommend this game? Of course! Hopefully they fix the problems and support this game like it should. Those complaing have good reason to do so, however there are a few faults in their accusations: 1: These games are from a different era where you had to really think and plan ahead, most may find the game a bit hard and frusterating as each mission always throws loops at you so in a sense you had to keep in mind what you brought to the table each time you finish a mission and start a new one. 2: They CLEARLY SAID that they were integrating HW2 mechanics into HW1, sad but they emphisized this multiple times 3: Many memebers of the Original Team were involved in this...dont go blaming Gearbox. Games must evolve, and adapt to changes in the industry. I also dont agree with everything but you have to ask yourself the basic question 'Is it fun?'   As someone whos played this game since its first release and still have the original disks, I bought this for 2 reasons. First being Steams support (Which could add a much bigger fanbase, and easier way to setup mods) and that I simply felt the need to assist this series by buying it.   They were never perfect but they were inspiring in their time... Just like now, its not perfect but why get so upset? Especially when they INCLUDED THE ORIGINALS!",

I was a little wary of paying $35 dollars for a 15 year old game no matter how 'remastered' it sounded, but I genuinely lovd the original Homeworld so much I decided to go ahead (I thought it would be great to be able to play online against friends for the first time in ages, as well!)   I was worried about that when I was still using the traditional definition of Remastered and not, 'turned into complete trash.' Between the bugs and the changes the game flounders near the area of unplayable. For examples of changes, fundamental tactical abilities like telling your fighters to be 'evasive' has simply been ripped out of the game. Whether or not this was to foment HWI vs HWII multiplayer is as irrelevant as it is uncertain, it renders figher groups so much less meaningful or useful. Fighters instead seem to behave in a sort of constant half aassed evasive which means that their aggressive behavior has also been scuttled.   For examples of bugs, from mission to mission my groups would fail to properly select. If I hightlighted, say, all the ships in group one then they might all show they were in group one, but if I actually hit one, only a few respond to the hail. I have to reselect and reassaign them all to 'rebuilld' between missions. But this is nothing compared to ships simply REFUSING TO OBEY ORDERS. I have tried playing The Wastelands three times now and in each instance a point was reached where some group of ships simply refused to move or engage no matter what they were instructed. I was especially impressed by my salvage frigates staring dumbly at me as I repeatedly tried to get them to capture a destroyer or, indeed, any ship as they slowly got picked off one by one.   I have never before felt compelled to write a negative review for Steam. It's one thing to simply make a bad game, that happens all the time. But this is a case of taking a masterpiece and destroying it. And I've been offered the chance to waste $35 dollars for the priviledge of watching one of my favorite games of old trashed in this manner.   Simply releasing the games for $5 apiece and rebuilding the multiplayer environment would have been the right move. As it stands, I regret this purchase without reservation and cannot recommend it, at least not until the myriad gameplay issues have been resolved. Even then, the graphis upgrades hardly justify $35. In my opinion, if you make this purcahse you are probably getting ripped off.",

But i would still reccomend HW remastered becuse the game breaking bugs it does have can be fixed and likely will, after all it's only been two days.  The Bad part(if actually want to play the storyline)  While the game is a highly polished work of art there are game breaking crashes and bugs during the single player game that will have you redo more missions than you can count. Sometimes objectives vanish, this led to me restarting a mission a few times.  10 hours of singleplayer gave me 5 crashes to windows in single player(4 of those times redoing the same mission over again) the the 5th time I had to redo two missions.  The multiplayer BETA works way better than the single player part. In fact ran so well I wondered why they even called it BETA.

            "review_text": "I write this review from the perspective of someone who did not play the original HW, or its sequel HW2. Negative reviews by old-timers seem to focus on gameplay changes from HW1 due to that Gearbox based both HW1 and HW2 in their remastered versions largely on HW2...but the lack of 'tactics' and such didn't faze me much. I also didn't rate it negatively because of it being released (I had pre-ordered) with some nagging bugs which, among others, meant that I couldn't even get in for a week after a mis-guided patch.   My 'thumbs down' is because I much disliked two core game mechanics which go back to HW1, into which I get after one paragraph on what I liked.  The game has a lot going for it - it's pretty, the music is nice, and the setting and writing is suitably dark scifi. I enjoyed simply watching resource harvesting; little details like the related animations show that the developers cared about making this look good. When I got to battle, I found the battles engaging and fun as well...but here's:  PROBLEM 1:  You don't really get to battle. In the game, you receive a spacecraft that can capture opposing spacecraft. And it's very good at it. If you're the optimizing, obsessive type (I am), this means that you build this craft and essentially nothing but this craft (to its limit of 14, but that's plenty), then go capture (almost) the entire opposing fleet. My battles looked as follows: (a) I park spacecraft I already own far away so they don't accidentally as much as shoot at the enemy, and then (b) I go hunting for the incoming ships, which, once captured, I (c) park with the rest of my fleet.   That's not very epic...but the following I liked even less -  PROBLEM 2:  Scaling of the strength of your enemy to your own strength. You carry over your fleet from prior missions. In an early mission (MINOR SPOILER), you enter the mission seeing the enemy attack six giant habitats which hold the rest of your race. I first entered this mission facing, I believe, 4-5 enemy ships, all larger than those you can have at that time. From a roleplaying perspective, it made me sad that I could only save about 2/3 of my remaining race...so I went back, this time diligently using what I describe under Problem 1 to amass a rather large fleet before this mission. I enter feeling good about myself...then see TEN or so big ships hammer away at my habitats, far enough away that, this time, they killed 2/3 of them before I even reached them. In fact, I think I saved 1/6, even though I abandoned the 'capture only' strategy I mention above and both hammered them and captured what I could.  That's just stupid. I read in forum posts regarding the original, that the cool winning strategy in the olden days was to completely dismantle your fleet at the end of a mission (you get almost all the money back; and if you captured the ships for free, it's even better), then, as soon as the next mission starts, re-build your fleet. As the game scales to your strength, you then face puny enemies in each mission - easily captured all, added to your fleet, dismantled with it at the end of the mission, and rebuilt at the start of the next...This completely destroys any kind of immersion. I'm not a fan of scaling-to-your-strength games anyway as that lack of immersion is almost inevitable.  A shame.",

Instead what you get is a half ♥♥♥♥♥ mod of the Homeworld 1 capaign for Homeworld 2. Almost nothing works as expected. The UI looks awful, feels awful and is in most ways no improvement over the original one. There is a reason there was no Homeworld 3.  The graphics look good. They did a fine job remodeling the ships. Unfortunately with none of the actual behavior modeled, the ships feel like empty husks. Turrets of corvettes don't seem to independently track and shoot enemy ships like they used to, and when big ships fire their giant cannons, there is no recoil on the turret. Everything feels like a 3d-Max model making pew pew sounds.  Formations don't work. Instead of the giant walls of capital ships surrounded by spheres of corvettes and wings of fighters you get to choose between a few different amorphous blobs and any time the ships move or see an enemy, the blog disintegrates.  Battles don't work. If you follow a fighter, you see that it couldn't hit a side of a mothership if it was docked inside it, making fights between fighters and corvettes take forever. On the other hand, assault frigates swat fighters out of the sky like so many flies. It's obvious Gearbox didn't even slightly try to match the balance of the original game.  Salvaging enemy ships doesn't work. Or one could argue that in all their bugginess they work too well. Just make a few of these and capture the whole enemy fleet: fighters, corvettes, everything, and you are done. Just don't build any of your own ships because they will shoot at the captured ships. You see, Homeworld 2 had boarding frigates that captured the targeted ships in place, so the engine doesn't actually support salvage ships that take their prey back into the mothership, and it's obvious that Gearbox didn't want to make any actual changes to the engine, or do any testing.  Homeworld 1 classic works. Too bad you don't get any graphical updates or UI features while playing it. Although, it's probably for the best since Gearbox doesn't seem to care about the things that made this classic great. Homeworld 1 is still a fantastic game and doesn't look nearly as dated as they make it look in their comparison videos. All they needed to do was these things: - Use the original physics and game simulation engine. - Update the 3d rendering engine to support modern resolutions and shadows. Although if that was too hard, updating just the models and textures would have been fine too. - Increase the simulation steps per second to at least 30. - Add time control.  Instead of doing these things, they made some nice looking ship models for Homeworld 2. Hence the turd that is Homeworld Remastered.",

Yes.   I bought two copies. One for me and one for my son. We both had same issues on two different computers.    Should you buy? Up to you. I got my codes off Amazon for less than Steam's preorder pricing, after release, and after I read great reviews. Would I buy again? Knowing what I know now, I would wait for it to go on sale. But that's just me. Hopefully they will fix the bugs.   That being said, as I said before, it IS fun, but knowing I might hit an advancement bug ruins some of that enjoyment. Graphic bugs, etc., I can accept, but not something that keeps the game from moving forward.   Edit: Finished mission 5 without a glitch, although it seems much easier than the original.

When I found out that they made a second game, I also quickly got that one, and played it just as much, although I was never able to finish it at the time. In time, I moved onto other games, and I have long since lost the disks for both of these games.  Every once in a while, I would check up on the status of the IP for the Homeworld series and would always be disappointed when I saw that it was tossed between companies, never to have a third game in the series. However, once I found out that it ended up with Gearbox and that they were going to be doing a remaster, I was ecstatic. At the time, many people were upset with the fact that Gearbox, who don't have a very good reputation with games, ended up with the franchise. I found no reason to doubt how good it would be, though. They would have actually TRIED to ruin a legitimate remaster in order to make it bad.  Once the game came out, I quickly pre-ordered, and discovered that it lived up to expectations. Some parts were lacking, including tactics and some balance issues with multiplayer (to be expected. it's still a beta!) but besides that, the rich story was all the same. It still holds the special place in my heart as my favorite game series ever, and I'm excited to see where Gearbox goes with this next (I'm so excited for Sands of Kharak.)  tl;dr: This game is very good.

Once you hear the Ion beams and the delightfully nonchalant battle chatter (a welcome distraction from the try-too-hard cliché military gruff stuff we are used to nowadays) you feel right at home. Controls still hold up, though I would've wished a middle mouse button camera panning. It's a nice throwback to when RTS wasn't about unit spam or superhuman micro capabilities.  The visuals are neat. Seing HW1 in this fidelity is a treat, HW2 also looks nicer but the leap isn't that big comparatively. Ship damage is still just pre-rendered 2d sprites but even those got increased resolutions. FOV is also cool but really gimmicky. Overall performance is decent, could be better though seeing as this isn't exactly cream of the crop visually despite all enhancements. This is still a 15 year old engine at its heart.  Negatives are that the AI wasn't improved and is still kind of dumb. They'll get stomped even if they keep up with your economy. Also the UI scaling doesn't affect the ever obnoxiously large sidebar.  Overall a recommended buy, for the ability to play this on current systems alone.",

Multitasking and designating your squads to defend carriers as well sending other squads to deal with the enemy carriers while you continuously harvest more resources and research. There is so much going on.  The ui is slightly different, personally I liked the old UI but this new UI all it takes is getting used to.  The PVP part of the game is where I think it will really make or break the game for the future. Personally I like the hyperdrive element brings in so many strategies like a decoy attack to the front of an enemy base while your team mate hyperdrives behind the enemy base and nukes.

Coming from only having played Homeworld Remastered, not 2, or the Classics, or the multiplayer, I can say it is... exactly how it was. It even played performance-wise the same way! I have a 550 Ti, and this this thing managed to pull a reliable 30 fps through 80% of the game, but there was a bit of dip in combat, so it was just like old times on my crappy Celeron PC back in the ages.  Now, the remastered version uses the Homeworld 2 engine, so if you only ever played Homeworld 1, you might be a little bit confused. I think the changes to the engine are a nice touch. I spent quite a lot of time admiring that all the ships look exactly the same, but just... better. The small details are REALLY nice, and I haven't even begun to touch them yet. I have to work tomorrow. ...maybe... For instance, when the Turanic Raiders are encountered, focus on one of corvettes' missiles. You'll see.  Anyway, there's any number of tangents I can go on, but basically, this game lives up to the hype machine that was created for it. I only got to mission 5, and I already don't reget buying this as a pre-order. I wouldn't regret buying it again for a different computer at full price.

The story is a classic tale of an odyssey across the stars to find your one true home, and along the way you meet friends, and monsters. You find those who have simply strayed from their paths, and those who want nothing more to see you burn. you must use your 3 dimensional battlefield to your advantage, and plot every move, for one slip up can cost you your fleet. The game is very well put together overall, and the originals are well preserved, the remastered ones however are not entirely true to the classic versions.

            "review_text": "+ Breathtaking story and atmosphere (music and voiceacting take a great part in this) + Better graphics / sound + Still works on older machines (My notebook is 4Y old and I can max out almost every setting) + Almost 1:1 to the original + New UI is imo much better in terms of usefulness + Voice acting is very good, also for the new lines + Cutscenes are beautiful + Auto collect at the end of a mission (thank you so much!)  Small minuses: - UI (...) is good but not perfect. I miss my list of ships and list of enemy ships in sight. It's much harder to see what you're up against compared to the original. - Well even tho I love how they tried to change as little as possible I would have been very happy if they implemented one or two more comfort functions from the other games. Namely: An option to 8x game speed (HW Cataclysm)  Some issues that might (hopefully) get fixed: - Support fregates have to move very close to a larger ship (i.e. destroyer) for repairs. Sometimes the ships circle around each other and the support fregate isn't able to 'dock' until the repair target is destroyed. This makes them completely useless in combat for everything above corvettes. Most of my ships died before the fregates could get in position. In the original they flew behind the ships and it was no problem. Edit: After a few missions I completely quit to build them. Useless and extremely frustrating. - Formations don't work. Not even if the ships are idle. Thats not a wall! - Same goes for the tactics. Example: Ships will often attack enemies that are being salvaged. That also happens sometimes even if tactics is set on Passive and you give a movement order in the opposite direction - Harvesters randomly idle even if there are still resources left (extremely irritating) - AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell, also your ships often move or realign in the most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ way possible.   It's critic on a high niveau. Still a very good game with a few flaws that will make you tear your hairs out.",

The graphics are amazing, and the changes they made to both HW1 and HW2 are much needed (for example, getting rid of the fuel requirement in HW1). These games are STILL the best RTS ever made, and they really shine here. If you've never played Homeworld, you've never experienced the best the RTS genre has to offer. Homeworld has been my all time favorite game since its release, so I am very critical of anything Gearbox is doing with this franchise. I'm happy to say that the remastering was done with a TON of care and love, and the bugs I've seen are very few and far between-a relief in this day of publishers releasing so many unfinished games. It can only get better from here. Way to go Gearbox, you've successfully brought back Homeworld! Now make Homeworld 3 so all my dreams can come true!",

Homeworld 1, 2 and Cataclysm (sadly not available) are some of the RTS games that I loved the most. Gearbox did not disappoint. The originals are here along with the upgraded versions, which bring the graphics up to modern standards. Remember how amazing the graphics were in '99? You'll feel the same about the remastered versions now. They are fantastic. The level of detail can be increased enough to send many modern, if not top of the line, graphics adapters into a stutter. The gameplay is fun and exciting.  Granted that many RTS games now have multiple resource types and Homework only has one, but the focus is not on resource production. The focus is on building a fleet comprised of ships that will match the fleet that opposes you. I have literally seen a fleet of destroyers picked apart by bombers and gunships. I have thrown a handful of destroyers against a group of 15-ish frigates and handed their ♥♥♥ to them on a platter. This game is all about knowing which ships to produce to come out on top.  Not enough can be said of the thoughtfulness and caring that went into the restoration of the original games. The audio briefings has been cleaned up a to a large degree and sounds much better than the originals. The graphics in the mission briefings are also improved, showing more detail.  If RTS is the genre you love and you haven't played Homeworld you need to give it a try. If you have any nostalgic memories of it at all then you need to get it again. And if possible, find yourself a USB powered mothership statue. I did, and I love it.",

            "review_text": "Updated: Make sure to read the bottom edit. The countless hours I spent on this series as a youngster were some of my fondest memories of gaming. I completed the campaign for Homeworld at least 3 times, HW2 twice, and Cataclysm (somewhat non-canon, but still good) a few times as well. I've only reached the fifth mission in this HW1 Remastered campaign, but it appears Gearbox did the series proud.   It's beautiful without compromising the original art, the updated interface is mostly an improvement (I'm not crazy about the different hotkeys) and the sound updates are amazing. There are nuances to the sounds that I never picked up in all the time I used to play the game.  One change that had me absolutely giddy is that it's now (much more) possible for salvage frigates to capture Turanic Raider ships. I always wanted a fleet of Missile Corvettes, and now it's possible to nab them all!  Overall, I'm blown away by this remaster. I'm overjoyed at how well it's done. If you never played the Homeworld games and you're an RTS or space fan, do yourself a favor and play this game, now.  Edit: There are some serious issues with the game that I hope will be fixed soon. These are:  1) Harvesting resources in HW1R is buggy, and requires babysitting and constantly reassigning the harvesters. They will stop harvesting, even when there are additional resources 30 seconds away.  2) Strike Craft Formations and Tactics are useless and broken: Moving HW1 content to the HW2 engine clearly broke these, and they are critical to making strike craft useful. As they are right now, you will constantly lose all your strike craft due to the unit AI's inability to utilize tactics and formations. It forces you to just boat captured Assault Frigate swarms and other Frigate/Capital ships instead. This is a major and disappointing issue, and possibly the worst of the list.  3) The projectile system was dropped in favor of the 'dice roll' system of HW2. This was one of the coolest parts of HW1, and was amazing to watch in action. Projectiles were actually fired and could hit targets on the other side of the target by accident. This led to strike craft being much more useful, as they could dodge rounds coming towards them, allowing them to overwhelm large capital ships. Now, Heavy Cruisers, Destroyers and Assault Frigates wipe out dozens of fighters without breaking a sweat. The best anti-everything weapon is just a mass of capital ships, in all circumstances. Forget attack bombers and defenders. The only reason to builds scouts and interceptors is as a cheap meat shield or disposable scouting element.  4) Time to Kill is INSANE. INSANE. Take two heavy cruisers or destroyers, and have them start shooting at each other. They die in like 30 seconds. It used to take twice that long, turning capital ship fights into epic slugging matches. Now, it's all just one giant, stupid deathball.  5) Scaled difficulty is broken: Just collect a few dozen ships, and by mission 10, you'll see what I mean. If you're familiar with the original HW, you'll see that they have more than quadrupled the number of enemy ships guarding the ghost ship. It's hilarious and game breaking.  I really hope they fix these issues, as HW is one of my favorite franchises, ever. It pains me to say this, but HW1R is not worth playing until most of the bugs get fixed. I haven't played HW2R enough to see, but I'm sure it's fine as it's in the same engine. If you want to play HW1, stick to the classic version. I pray it doesn't have the same issues.",

I can tell you, for a fact, that she loved the original game and was overjoyed when she had the opportunity to play this.  The graphics are superb, and she loved every minute that she played of it.   Here is the review that she asked me to copy for the game.  Pros: The graphics- the graphics will melt your eyeballs directly into your head. The brightness of the sun as it pans into your viewscreen would turn any vampire into dust immediately. They are THAT realistic.  Gameplay- Combat happens quickly, and it cannot be paused. You can restart any time that you wish from a quick saved game, but who wants to do that? Death and destruction is part of the galaxy, folks, and you will see plenty of it.  Audio- Your neighbors will insist that the Apocolypse has arrived, centered in your living room. Even at the lowest volume, if you have downstairs neighbors then they will be pounding on their ceiling for you to turn it down. The explosions rattled my teeth and killed my pet skunk. Not before he sprayed his gunk everywhere, though.  Battlefield size- The best game that I ever played that comes close to this is Sins of a Solar Empire. If you've played that, imagine each battlefield to be as large as an ultra large galaxy map in its entirety. Battlefields are in true 4D space, and combat happens from up, down, sideways, behind you, diagonally, etc. TRUE 4D. The only way it could be better would be if you could actually feel the heat from the explosions, but then your couch would be melted and you would be dead. I suppose we should stick with 4D.  Cons: Length. Too short. I spent (as many hours as it showed I played) and didn't even come close to finishing it, but I knew how many missions there were. I made it to (check my achievement history) before I couldn't play anymore, and it is the high point of my last half year. Knowing that the end of the game was coming mad me sad, and I wanted to cry. Then why did I say it's too short? Because it will come to an end, eventually.   I wholeheartedly endorse this game, and this is the largest review that I've ever written for any game in my library. That means a lot.   ************************  That ends her review, and I agree. I watched her play, and was mesmerized by the storyline and the action. I never played the game before, so it was all new to me. This game is not going to be a waste of your time or money, I promise.",

The Good:     Beutiful graphics - no seriously it looks absolutely stunning yet retains the feel of the original game.    Smooth gameplay - no stuttering and vessles move about nicely only with some issues.    Fantastic story and animated cutscenes - provides great depth to the game and you could loose hours in the homewolrd wiki    Intuative controls - easy to command an entire fleet without it feeling too daunting. You can move about 3D space very easily and are able to plan attacks accordingly.    The bad:     The tutorial is fairly buggy. The voice commands sometimes do not correspond with what you see on the screen and it it tells you to press a button to continue when it automatically continues anyway.    Resource collectors glitch out - In some instances they just do not want to participate in helping at all    Research vessel dance around when constructing the ring of them. Not a big issue but they look pretty goofy    Sometimes vessle movement is restricted such as in mission 4 when you encounter the trade ship. I was not able to gather the resources I needed to continue.    To conclude:  A fantastic tribute to what I consider the best RTS game of all time. It is wonderfully executed and it is very easy to sink many hours into this game. I entirely recommend.",

One of my favorite RTS games makes a return with remastered enhancements that bring new life back to the Homeworld universe. Gearbox and Blackbird Interactive did a good job with the enhancement and I hope this success will continue to drive forward as they expand on the series. I haven't played any multiplayer yet as I'm focusing on the campaign and skirmishes. This is one of those games you want to bath in the full treatment and not rush any one particular feature. There's plenty to do and much value to absorb.  Graphics + Plenty of in-game options to enhance graphical quality. + Models and textures are pretty sharp and detailed. + Nice explosion effects. + Lots of tiny details like ship damage decals, resource extraction effects, lens flares, sun rays, etc. + Space environments are beautiful. - Shadows are a bit 'noisy' around the edges. Not as high calibre like other games. - UI is a bit dated looking and could have been enhanced better.  Audio + Music suits the gameplay and the environments well. Quality is very crisp. + Sound quality is pretty good and feels crisp as well. + Explosions and cannons have a good punch on my sub. - Game lacks 3D positional audio, which would have enhanced the immersion as your camera rotates around ships and battles.  Gameplay + AI gives a good challenge. It keeps the pressure on as you foucs on survival. + Good balance of combat &amp; time investment. Skirmishes are not to long and not to short. You're always on the move. + Classic RTS that sticks to the tried and true formula. Research, build, and tactics all within a space theme. - Little awkward there's no easy way to pan around quickly, or that the camera has a limit on the zoom-in/out range. In most modern RTS games, you move around quickly. Given the 3D positions in Homeworld, it can be awkward to get your camera in the right position without first orienting it on an object nearby, then moving over to where you want to go.  Campaign / Single Player + Just like the original, only better with the new HD visuals and audio. + Challenging missions and interesting story with a sense of adventure.  Quality + Haven't run into any breaking issues so far. - ESC key doesn't bring up the menu like you would expect in most PC games. - PrintScreen is not the default screenshot key. ScrollLock is (like what?). Can't seem to bind it to PrintScreen either.  Overall + Would recommend this game. Homeworld is fun RTS, now with better visuals and audio. Combined with modding support, the possibilities are open for the community to introduce new scenery, new game modes, total conversions, etc. Add on 2 games + the originals, plenty of campaign missions, adventerous story, good music, AI skirmishes, and multiplayer. There's a lot of value here and if you haven't tried the Homeworld series before, consider checking this little gem out.",

Recommend it to anyone interested in space RTS games or a fantastic space saga in general.

            "review_text": "This is a biased review - let's get that out of the way early.  Having played the three originals, and having kept an eye on the progress of the remasters, it's fair to say that I was a fan before release, and one of those 'old guys' who eagerly awaited this arrival with crossed fingers and a daily prayer to the gaming gods for Gearbox not to screw it up.   Was it going to be a labour of love, a cash-in, a botch job? I was understandably concerned.  Straight out of the gate, there's a clue. When the opening titles splash, and it's introduced as a remastering of a game by Relic first and foremost, you realise that these guys are paying due deference to the source. I knew this already, as Gearbox have gone out of their way to collect original voice actors, and even original design team members to give this the attention it needs. They spent time putting everything in place to reproduce a classic. More than that, what originally started out as a simple release with a HD upgrade turned into a full-on remaster with not just improved visuals, but high fidelity sound. Gearbox had the chance to make this a cash grab. They passed up that chance of merely cleaning the windows and elected to give it a full service, respray, a new set of tyres, and replaced the engine while they were there. Sadly for some, they did mess with the handling a little, but I'll get to that.  Whenever I load up the originals, while they're still excellent in gameplay, the visuals are suffering. They don't look like how I remember them. There appears to be some gap between reality and my imagination. My imagination upgrades visuals as I go along, and I'm invariably disappointed when I find that my memory is lying to me and the games have a lower resolution than my imagination does. Original HW2 still looked pretty good, but HW1 was showing its age badly. Apparently Gearbox thought the same. The remastered versions look like how I imagine the originals. They look better.  They're beautiful.  Nebulae are rich and vibrant, with that otherworldly quality that makes space look much more lovely than it is. Ships are detailed, explosions are impressive and Kharak and Hiigara have never looked so amazing. In one sweeping moment, all the graphical issues that come with decades old games - gone.  So far so good. How's the gameplay though?  Gearbox have modified HW1's gameplay to be more like HW2. This will be sacrilege for some, and for those who thought HW2 improved a lot of things, it will seem as simply sensible.  Fighter formations are no longer entirely static. They hold formation until they engage the enemy, and then as one would expect, they break off into one almighty hairball with contrails zipping in and out of each other to the incongruous tune of vacuum explosions. This seems more realistic (minus the forgivable space sound), and yet it unarguably removes a facet of the original that some will find hard to bear.  Some won't like it. I realise that, and I think Gearbox did too. They telegraphed it ahead of release to ease fans into the idea. Time will tell if Gearbox patch this feature back in. Also, the fuel mechanic is gone. Can't say I lament its passing. It was tedious.  Other than that, Gearbox have kept a very light touch, and have changed very little. They clearly know not to mess with a proven title too much. There are good reasons for the changes they did make however. To allow a seamless transition from the first to the second game, one of them would have to change as there were some significant differences. You can literally play them back to back now, and they feel like you're playing the same game. Nothing jars.   Also, the UI is standard across the two. It's now even more minimalist than it used to be, allowing you more screen real-estate to watch the carnage. It doesn't take long to navigate your way round, and in no time at all you'll find yourself hotkeying your way to victory.  Other than that, Gearbox have left the gameplay largely untouched, which is interesting. They must have been tempted to 'do a Lucas', but they didn't. What's even more interesting is that the gameplay from two titles which are now 16 and 12 years old respectively, doesn't suffer by modern standards. They're perfectly fine. I'm not sure of any other genre that could make that boast, but then, there really hasn't been much like Homeworld since.  People still compare it to its nearest contemporary, Sins of a Solar Empire, and that is telling. Sins is nothing like Homeworld. Both are set in space, and both are viewed from a god's eye view, and that's it.   Of course, for those who simply cannot stand the few changes that have been made, Gearbox included the two originals as well, with some fixes to enable them to run on modern machines.  There are some bugs. I've had a couple of crashes and there appears to be a persistent engine audio bug that is banished by opening the game menu. Others report more bugs than I've seen, so hopefully Gearbox will get on the case and tweak a little.  All in all, for the price, you cannot go wrong. Two games, two versions of each. One for the more strident hard-like fans, and an updated version for everyone else that is simply a joy to play. All for the price of one game.   I was starting to fear these games would be lost to the history bin, but thanks to Gearbox I've managed to walk with the Kushan once more on their cosmic caravan to regain their Homeworld, and also with the newly renamed Hiigarans, striving against overwhelming odds to preserve it. It was as much a pleasure this time round as the first.  Hopefully, now that HW1 and 2 are accessible once more to the gaming public, Gearbox will move on from here to Homeworld 3, and Shipbreakers, the latter of which is already well into development. After playing through the beautiful Remastered games, I'll be waiting eagerly.  For those who have never played these games, fair warning, they may seem harder than modern gamers are accustomed to, but they're as brilliant now as they were originally, and even though it's a much overused cliche, they deserve a place on any gamer's digital shelf.  Now, back to killing those Taiidani and Vaygr scum ...  ",

Loading the autosave does not help as the damn game garbled its own save state. I have been told online that I literally have to start over again from the previous mission.  And the winner is - on the tutorial there is a 'press ok to continue' mechanic.... but the voice just keeps on going whether you press ok or not... It's only an annoyance but to me it's emblematic of the trashy quality of this port.  Do not buy this for HW1, you will be disappointed by how buggy and glitchy it is.",

If you never played it the first time around, you need to buy this; the gameplay was never ever beaten, the story and mission variety is truly excellent, and the art direction is unique.  If you *have* played it before: BE WARNED:  At the moment, some of your favourite features from Homeworld 1 are rather broken. Formations, for example, do not work; your units will ignore them in combat completely, so no more flying balls of death with the sphere formation. Considering how a prominent a role the formations played in the original game, and how a simple formation switch mid-battle could turn the tide, this is a major issue, and one that really shouldn't have made it out of testing.  Also, remember how you could capture all those assault frigates on the third map? Nope. Not anymore. Due to Homeworld 2's unit cap rules, you cannot capture a ship if you don't have the capacity. And you don't have the capacity, if you haven't researched it yet.  Additionally, there are a few general bugs and AI mishaps, such as pathfinding being a bit dodgy (telling two support frigs to heal your ships will result in them bumping into each other and often allowing the ship to die), and engine sounds hanging (so you can hear a ship's engines really loud no matter where you are).  In other words, in spite of the word 'remastered', don't expect this to be *polished*. It's great, because it's Homeworld, but it needs some patching.  That being said, despite having to launch the campaigns separately, the skirmish mode allows all content; you can play Homeworld 1 fleets against Homeworld 2 fleets if you want.

You never encounter real consequences to your decision making in modern games!  there are still some minor bugs, like invisible cannons on a captured taiidan carrier, but i can live with that. when i have finished both campaigns i will start to try the multiplayer beta. i heard though that there are more bugs there, which is to be expected.  this game will begin to really shine in a few months, when all the modding communities kick in. the moment the complex mod guys release complex 10 for remastered, this will be the most epic multiplayer strategy game of all times again :)  and lets not forget, the better this game does, the better the chances for a homeworld 3!",

They did a great job in making things seem vast. It really adds to the game. This game is slow paced with moments of frenzy and panic. (especially when you realize you messed up and the enemy tears your beloved fleet to pieces......) I really do enjoy the slow pace. Everything seems to take time but it is a good balance. This is not a game to play in fifteen minute periods. If you don't have an hour or two at a time this is not a game for you.   The graphics are good but not great. The backdrops are epic. The lighting is good. It's just the close ups and cut scenes are not as polished as I would like. But, this is a remaster.   The user interface while a bit overwehlming at first is far easier to learn than it first appears. My only complaint about the game is the camera control. I am hoping I will get used to it but after 12 hours i am still swearing at it. I never seem to be able to get the angle i need or get everything in the frame that I need to look at.   All in all I would reccomend this game. I have been playing it for a few days now and I'm hooked. The story itself is a little thin in contenet but it's a good one. I really would not consider that a con. Just a statement. I am loving this game.   Graphics 7/10 Audio 8/10 Story 8/10 Gameplay 7/10 ( Just fyi I knocked 2 off for the camera controls.)",

I can almost forgive that for samll Indy developers but a studio who payed this much for the Homewrold licence really should not release a Beta prouct as a complete game. Sounds regularly glitch out, leaving buzzing or crackling in the background. Keep catching glipses of ships before the jump in. The tutorial has a 'Press OK to continue' prompt and a bright red 'OK' button in the middle of the screen, but it just keeps barrelling through the instructions without waiting for you to press. And half-way through the second mission, my screen has gone black. Can still see the control UI and hear my ships being annihilated, but the view is black.  Almost forgot - the control scheme is pretty akward. Right-click and drag, scroll to zoon and so on seem to be fixed to the orintation of the system eliptic, not your own view - drag up when your oriented one way, and you go up. Spin you view around 180 degrees and suddenly draggin up  takes you downwards. Really confusing. I never played the original - I owned the disk's but somehow never got around to installing them - so I couldn't comment on how accurate the re-imagining is, but reading the reviews, a number of popular features from the first where ripped out. Hopefully Modding will allow some of these to be fixed. In spite of the glitchy-ness it is a fun game and one I look forward to playing - but only if the y can actually fix these bugs.",

            "review_text": "Homeworld and Homeworld 2 were the best real-time space strategy games ever made. Every game made since then has tried to be them, and has fallen flat by comparison.  I am, however, still on the fence about the remastered versions of these games. While they are graphically beautiful, without a doubt, a much needed upgrade to the visuals of the game, there are some differences in the missions, interface, and unit actions that I simply do not like.  The first thing that cheesed me off with the first game was the interface change. While the interface for HW2 is, technically better, they changed unit behavior to match. This is a huge problem when you assign a bunch of units to guard something important, put those units on sphere formation, and rather than surrounding the unit they are guarding and forming a ball of guns around it, they just sit there beside it in something akin to a circle and not being the defensive line you were expecting. This is more a glitch than anything, because this tactic worked fine in the orignal HW2 (it was just harder to implement with the interface changes), and does not work at all in the remaster.  Some of the missions are very different from their original versions, making them much harder than they used to be. There's a mission where your warp coordinates are incorrect and you warp into a moving asteroid field. This is where I would normally turn into a wall of guns in front of my mothership, but aggressive tactics doesn't work on the asteroids in the remaster. In addition to this, you are in the asteroid field longer than originally, so you have to prevent damage to the mothership for a much longer period of time. This may not seem like a major issue unless you've already built several super-capitals and warp into the mission with 6 destroyers, each a fourth the size of the mothership, and these are getting taken out because they will only shoot the rocks you tell them to and it is impossible to defend them and the mothership from damage, leading to huge attrition and losses that were pointless.  Homeworld 1 and 2 were already challenging games. There was no need to make it more challenging. There was no difficulty selection back then. Games had to be an acceptable challenge level right out of the gate with a smooth transition in their difficulty from the beginning of the game to end. Putting players against BS odds is not making a game harder, it's making the player face BS. There is a difference. Don't believe me? Play the first 8 levels of the original game, and then play the first 8 levels of the remaster. Something will feel different and off. While it may be prettier to look at, it simply won't feel as if you had as good an experience as you did the first time.  For those of you who never played this game when it first came out and felt the disappointment of games that just weren't as good that followed, you are about to enjoy one of the greatest games ever made, whether you are playing the original or the remaster. Perhaps I'm simply jaded from waiting for similar games to even compete with this one since the death of Sierra with no good alternatives. Perhaps my expectations are too high. I don't know. I will still recommend this game a million times over any other space RTS. Relic and Sierra, I salute you for the awesomeness that were the originals. Gearbox, I salute you for attempting to live up to the originals.",

The biggest issues are broken formations, a poor UI, and ship AI ripped straight from HW2 without a thought if it applies to ships from HW1 (it doesn't). Where the challenge should come from tactics, formations and resourcing, the challenge actually comes from fighting a fiddly UI and ships that refuse to hold formation the moment they enter combat.   After two missions I switched to vanilla HW1, and although it looks dated, it is so much more... fun. I guess after porting the game into the HW2 engine there was not a lot of time for what really matters, the game itself. I find it telling that so many reviewers have neglected to mention how such core parts of HW1 are either missing or broken from this game. Or maybe I am just a demanding (and ageing) grouch who misses the golden age of PC gaming :)  Hopefully a hail mary patch from Gearbox or some talented modders can rescue this missed opportunity. I would encourage everyone who feels the same to post in the Gearbox support forum.",

Hearing about the remastered edition, I nearly screamed in excitement because the game is long overdue for a refreshment, and I'm happy that I bought it.  (JUST THE REVIEW OF THE REMASTERED HOMEWORLD CLASSIC, NOT 2) Okay, details now:  What I like about the Remastered Edition of Homeworld (aside from its obvious graphics) is the new UI. It's much cleaner and is easily accessible all on one screen without actually visiting the 'Build', 'Rearch' &amp; 'Launch' pages, which are now converted to panels. Having said that there are some downsides to it: I cannot click the 'B' key to quickly close my 'Build' panel, likewise with the 'Launch' panel, but only works with the 'Research' panel. It's not a huge problem, but it gave me a feeling that the remastering was rushed, rather than tested.  Secondly, I don't like the unit ships display on the lower left corner, that in itself is more appropriate for Homeworld 2. I much rather have the Unit Ships of the Homeworld Classic, originally displayed on the top right corner for easily monitoring how many ships I have left in the game. It doesn't matter where it's displayed, I could care less, but having Homeworld 2's UI for Unit Ship Display in a Homeworld Classic where it's Build Per Ship, not Build Per Group of Ships, is annoying. All I see are just colorful outlines of random ships in a non-scrollable display, with my assumption to myself, 'even though I built 30 Interceptors.... maybe I have 25 left? Less? Idk?'  Sound can be glitchy, where ship chatter is close to non-existent, or I'm dealing with persistent ship engine noise all game, even when I pan far far far away, and docking is the only option left for me to get rid of that painful white-noise.  And now, capturing ships with Salvage Corvettes doesn't intern them into my ships, they get recycled, and now I'm stuck with more minutes into each stage of the game just rebuilding them, because if you know anything about Homeworld, it's this: SALVAGE SALVAGE SALVAGE = BIGGER ARMY.  So there are more Cons than Pros on the Remastered Collection, however that being said, I'm still a proud supporter of the game and the series, I just wished that the Remastering did some more gameplay testing before launching. Now I'm just sitting back and hoping that there will be updates to the game.",

            "review_text": "90% of the reason I bought this game was for the Battlestar mod. I'd never played a Homeworld game before this but the mod videos looked good. So I made my purchase a few days ago and fired it up. I got some silly error about my graphics card not being suitable but brushed past that and started Homeworld 1 remastered. Being a complete beginner I started the tutorial. The smooth woman's voice guiding me was nice until the tutorial skipped that I now know to be several segments. Upon a restart, I breezed through the tutorials. Stumbling at the 3D movement every now and then, and sadly an issue that I still cant fully work out, (there has to be an easier way than moving the camera to a top down view, right clicking then moving the camera again to a new perspective so I can work out the height/depth that I want you to go...I don't want you to travel 20km off to the flank thanks.)  I finally got to the meat of the game, started the single player, got comfortable as I watched the opening cinematic and level opening. The scale of things didn't hit me until I zoomed all the way into the 'Mothership', then all the way to the tactical map, then into one of my small craft. I was already immersed at this point as I circled the camera to look at Kharak, my race's 'home planet'. It was just a sky box but it was so impressive especially when coupled with the haunting Adagio for Strings, I got the feeling hammered home that this 'Mothership' in front me was the last hope for my people, tasked with using the new and untested hyperspace module to carry our people to there true homeworld. I carried on through the first two missions enjoying figuring out the particulars of the games mechanics.  Suddenly I'm alerted to enemy attack. I'd been expecting things to go sour as per video games so I was already building up a fleet of strike craft much bigger than was necessary, over compensating for what could be a simple scout mission (a trait I take into pretty much all the games I've played, why whittle down the small number of enemies with a few craft of my own when I can bulldoze them). Eventually time came to jump back to Kharak and this is when the game took my already immersed self and shoved a bucket of feels down my throat.  (Thar be spoilers from here). I was greeted by the hauntingly beautiful Adagio for strings again, but something was wrong. Debris in the background, the music swelled as I turned the camera toward Kharak. 'Kharak is burning' is a line that will stick with me from now as one of the most overpowering lines in a video game. I was overcome as I listened to my ship and military commander relay the situation, with clearly stifled words. What now I wondered until I was alerted to the ships still in the system, watching them attack the Cryo trays...the last of my civilisation. No way I thought as I regained command. My attack force was already massive and I was ordered to capture one of then ships for interrogation...Happily. My fleet wiped out three of the attackers in rapid succession as my salvage corvettes dragged the final ship into my Mothership. I then moved to save the cryo trays and rescue my race.  We finally jumped away from Kharak, the sombre voice of my commander promising retribution. The following missions were all interesting in there own ways, from simple resource gathering to fund the upcoming war, to meeting a new alien collective in the heart of a nebula, being offered sanctuary in exchange for my pilgrimage home before being promised destruction for our refusal. The nebula mission was a complete eye opener for me in regards to this game, my enormous and diverse strike force was ripped to shreds by this new race. My resources were being rapidly depleted as I struggled to retain my forces. Eight minutes later I could jump and happily obliged only to be stopped in my tracks by a series of hyperspace inhibitors. Vastly out gunned, with limited resources, I funded a new Destroyer capital ship to lead my depleted forces and escape this hell. I spent an hour on this one mission, destroying the inhibitors then scouring the nebula for whatever resources I could muster. Another 45 minutes later and I had recovered a series of my losses and finally prepared to leave the system. To go from military domination to desperate defender in the space of 6 minutes was brutal and a wonderful aspect of the game.  That's as far as I am for the moment but the highlight is still the third mission. The effect this mission had on me will be one I remember fondly through the rest of my gaming years, seeking out new experiences and hoping for something to hit me as hard as Homeworld. It's a pity that I waited this long to play Homeworld and while there will always be complaints made about the remastered editions, as a newcomer, I have had practically no issues with the game, the formations are pretty cool for lining up the fleet but as is a widespread issue for some, they break upon contact which isn't a huge issue for me but I'd definitely play through this game again with the original functionality.  TL:DR - Game is wonderful from a newcomers perspective and I couldnt recommend it more. Third mission = best mission so far.",

I originally plus voted this game, I had joined a clan (TAW) for it and found the game amazing fun, but now I look back upon that, having not played the game in literally months and finding myself utterly reluctant to play I decided a Plus vote was wrong.  The game is a HD remake with a few bonus goodies thrown in, but with terribly done systems which are currently being overhauled by the 3 guys who've been assigned to this. IT does feel like Gearbox has dug this one up because a few of the nerd guys kept ♥♥♥♥♥ing on at them to do it, so they did, only to abandon it for them to do with literally no resources. Updates are still in dire need for problems which have been around since day 1, the SDK &gt;STILL&lt; hasn't been released limiting the modding community and holding off the HUGE mods everyone loved and adored on the original game, despite having this beautiful steam workshop support.  The community for the game is basically dead, with the peak online players being 30, at one stage it was still only roughly 100 people and it only goes up to this magical 30 during the sales, after that it goes straight down to 3/4 people, if you're lucky.   Online play is hardly a matter of tactics anymore, it's a case of either people rush you, or they rush you. It becomes less about master tactics and more a matter of who can speed their sorry ♥♥♥ to the end-game ships in under 10 minutes. Making even large 8-player games really short and unfullfilling, plus it ends up being a game where poeple just write out build queues and stick religeously to them and even trying to counter said attempt doesn't work outside of a 1v1 situation (As they will likely have someone else with them doing counter-tactics).   The sheer lack of playable races only enforces the above, having an RTS game where you can only play as 4 factions makes the game pretty stale, pretty quick, as there is nothing in the way of fun and variety, you quickly find out what's useless and what's not within about 3 games and then find yourself re-repeating the same tactics in every game.   The campaign is marginally better than the online, as you do often have to think about tactics and such. Although the AI is pretty easy to outfox and out-manuever (as they don't seem to use this brand new vertical plane as much as you'd imagine they would).  Pros: Good Storyline, challenging as well even with cheats and workarounds (i.e. editing to give yourself infinite RUs which I did honestly try on my second play through to check if it was easier) Good Quality graphics and sound with little in the way of hardware stress (I run a laptop on highest settings) The addition of the Vertical axis makes the game more intense and brings a greater need for tactics Units and upgrading are all fairly simple to pick up.  Cons: In Multiplayer you only get 4 factions and the Hiigarans are the one with the best units, Vaygr are okay but only a really decent player can use them effectively and the Kushan / Taiidan are rushing races which have paper-units compared to the other two. Cannot play as the other introduced races w/o mods which are often filled with unbalanced units. (Would like to see the others come in officially at a later update or expansion pack with more campaign). Multiplayer is fairly buggy. The game has quite a few bugs which demand patching but as such, gearbox is slow in releasing updates for the game. Small community. Workshop is HEAVILY UNDER UTILISED with no support given to modders, meaning mods like the Stargate, Star Trek, Halo and Mass Effect are still only working for the original games.",

The Homeworld 2 Remaster is good I think, but that was generally considered to be an inferior game. I never played the original Homeworld 1. The new combined multiplayer is very beta. The graphics settings are confusing and don't have any explanations. There's no manual either.   The Remastered versions don't include as many improvements as I hoped they would. I find the camera very dated and frustrating. Its zoom is too limited. I wish there were expanded control options like a follow command, auto repair command, ship rotation/orientation, hold position, auto use abilities command, etc. The new UI is very generic and boring compared to the old one. I think it was a very bad idea to port Homeworld 1 into the Homeworld 2 engine for the sake of a multiplayer beta. Homeworld 1 should have been remastered in its own engine.

            "review_text": "I've been waiting for something like this for a very, very long time.  I got the first Homeworld a month after it was released in '99 for my 12th birthday; besides being insanely happy that my parents had finally gotten me a present 'up my alley' without any prompting whatsoever, I was excited to have a new game that also pushed my boundaries a bit. Up till then, I'd really only been a gamer because I was a *huge* Star Wars fan, and indulged that interest in whatever way I could, be it novels, comics, or games. Tearing off the giftwrap and seeing a new PC game that wasn't a Star Wars title, but was still set in space, and was also an RTS (a genre I liked but decent titles in the Star Wars franchise being somewhat of a rarity), that for the time had amazing visuals if the screencaps on the back of the box were anything to go by, had me bouncing in my seat.  And I instantly fell in love. The manual was basically a novel, not only did it have instructions, it was a primer on the backstory leading up to the events in game (I sorely miss those days, Mechwarrior was another title that had this type of thing going for it...*sigh*, nostalgia..). The first few missions had me dumbstruck by the 'in your face' factor-seeing your own home planet nuked to a crisp is enough to leave anyone a bit dumbfounded. The visuals didn't disappoint; skyboxes were gorgeous, explosions from dying ships were well done, seeing a fleet of Ion frigates all gang up on a Heavy Cruiser to make it pop like an overripe berry was amazing, the fact that you now had to strategize in three dimensions as opposed to two, as well as watch out for pesky Salvage Corvettes trying to steal your own ships to be turned against you was innovative...it was an *amazing* game, and after completing the story missions, I felt as if I really had led the remnants of my civilization on a grueling trek across the galaxy to their ancestral homeworld, battling pirates, the space faring equivalent of the Heaven's Gate cult, and the oppressive tyrannical empire that exiled you in the first place in millennia past along the way; I felt like I *accomplished* something, which was rare for a game even in those days, and is now even rarer.  Homeworld 2 took what was good about the first entry and made it better. Fleets had even more versatility, graphics were improved even more, the 'underdog' feeling was back even though you'd now been an established power in the in game universe's lore for a few decades, the amazing soundtrack from the first game was improved upon, with tracks that would feel right at home in a cathedral.  The Remastered editions take the visuals from the second game, improve them slightly, and then apply that standard to both games, which is awesome. What's not so awesome is the fact that some mechanics have been changed slightly, which actually results in certain campaign missions needing to be played in an entirely different, and often less enjoyable, way. For example, one mission near the end of the campaign in the first game consists of a sensor array surrounded by a giant sphere of enemy ships protecting it. Strategy for this mission dictated that you use cloaked Salvage corvettes to slowly steal a large number of these enemy ships, bolstering your fleet size to be able to both take on the rest, as well as destroy the sensor array, and leave you with a sizable force for the final mission, after completing the next two. With the new mechanics, this is now nearly impossible; when your Salvage 'vettes latch on to an enemy ship, they no longer remain cloaked, which instantly alerts all nearby enemies, resulting in the loss of your corvettes and the loss of the stolen ship. Now you have a choice of either trying to lure small sections of the sphere away to pick off piecemeal, or engaging the entire enemy force, both of which result in significant losses to your own fleet, and at this point in the game resources for replacing your losses are scarce. This makes the final 3 missions after this one next to impossible due to having such a reduced fleet of your own, and you do indeed need a rather large force to handle everything thrown at you in the final mission.  Overall, it's still a great game, and brings back a boatload of nostalgia for me personally, with stupendous visuals and an excellent soundtrack..I just wish the new developers had been content to simply improve graphics rather than try and tweak with game mechanics.",

MP Balance is still a work in progress since HW1 and HW2 units now have yet another mechanic to negotiate.  Some compromises were made for formations. Instead of having a giant wall formation of frigates, each formation has a maximum (varies depending on size of ship from 9-15) unit count, so you'll end up with many small wall formations instead. Sphere formation still doesn't guard/attack a unit in its center, but at least claw is still more effective than no formation.  MP Replays are still a missing feature, something that was present in HW1 MP, but I dont think that's going to ever be coming.  SP is still great (The Ladder ending is gone though), crashes seem rarer but most of that was already fine pre-patch.  Game is still fun, and there are a lot of options in MP. Unfortunately, player count is &lt;50. It's a real shame that a lot of these fixes came so late for a supposedly venerated title.",

Models are completely redone for the remastered HW1 version, not just a slap of new skin.  APRIL 26, 2016 But, the bugs are huge, and the developers are apparently not wanting to make this game stable. Some annoying, game breaking bugs are:  1. Collectors stop collecting randomly, you must keep an eye on them. This flaw really hurts in game when you're low on resources, much to my surprise it's because the collectors are taking a smoke break.  2. You can't Kamikaze, I think only the HW2 ships can.  3. You can only select one ship at a time to salvage, not a group. Apparently, salavage corvettes have a limited attention span now?  4. Some ships ignore orders. Most notoriously, support frigates.  5. Ships get anxious around asteroids, spaz out for awhile before moving/following an order.  6. AI in CPU vs Player mode knows where you are at all times, will hyperjump to you within a minute when you try escaping. And of course, BattleCruisers always have the GravWell enabled when they jump.  7. Capital ships have a limited attention span, will attack other ships despite you telling them to attack a different one in front of them.  8. You cannot enable Fuel mode in multiplayer (HW1). This makes strategy less interesting, it always made those long distance attack runs a nail biting adventure.  9. Not a fan of HW2, stopped 1/3 the way through.   10. If the AI in multiplayer has HW2 ships, you're essentially toast. Maybe it's a different type of strategy, but I could never seem to match their fleet strength playing as a HW2 race.",
