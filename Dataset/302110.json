            "review_text": "Small Town Terrors Pilgrim's Hook is putting you in the shoes of Vera, a young woman in her thirties, whose twin brother called for help, as he came back to their native island of Pilgrim's Hook. Now moved by the need to save him, she returns there to discover that there is a surnatural entity that wants her...  The plot of the game is well-written: you're first there to save your brother Arthur and you end up to be wanted by a surnatural entity that is terrorizing somewhere the inhabitants that stayed. You don't know why it wants you but it's not set at all to kill you... Given the fact that you're the only one that is resisting its power, maybe it thinks that you may become an apprentice or something like that.  Anyway, it promises a dark setting and indeed, between the village kinda dead, fogs or even abandoned houses (yours among them), the scenes are really well drawned. The soundtrack is good too.  But I've kinda a problem with the gameplay. I mean, it's great to find items but in some scenes, you have to move so much stuff that it can be quite boring after a while. Besides, as I played in French, some words used weren't familiar to me. I took minutes to find a single item, resorting to click on any items. And some of them weren't really easy to spot. But the puzzles are well balanced.  As it's a CE, it means bonus. So, you have a bonus chapter, concept arts, etc... Also, there are in-game achievements that could have been without problems on Steam, as they're the usual ones: finish a scene in less than a minute, don't use hints, find Cestor's creatures (kind of beyond objects), etc..  If I find 15 euros a little too much for the games as there are some of the same type (Collector's Edition) that are a little above in terms of quality and that are less expensive, it's still worthy of your wallet. Go for it.",
