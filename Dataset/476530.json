            "review_text": "I like the fact that someone is trying to make a game that is science based and not just eye candy. I wouldnt call the game 'early access', it is 100% playable and I found zero bugs in the few hours I have played, BUT the game is still a little rough around the edges.   Here are a few thoughts (based on only a few hours play and only on the first few missions) :   - Nothing like KSP. You can build your own ships and adjust orbits, but that is where the similarities end. I do not want anyone to read this review thinking that this is KSP with nukes and lasers. [EDIT: This is more like the old game Harpoon or Command: Modern Air Naval Operations] This game is about battlefield decisions. Having played KSP first, I found lining up orbits and intersecting kinda easy (at least in the first few missions), but each mission is decided in a battle at a single intersecption or fly-by. You have either are entering a battle that uses your strengths or not. You dont have have the resources to try another orbit or 'attack' again because you wont have the delta-v or undamaged systems to even bother trying another pass. - Since each mission is determined by a single encounter, things go bad in battle fast. This is fine, but the battles seem to play in real time only, no pausing and no time scaling. This makes the game hard to control and it is hard to try new things (and it is hard to see what is really going on). More importantly, IT IS HARD TO ENJOY BATTLES. Given the short nature of battles I think the graphics are fine, but the battles happen sooooo fast the player does not get a chance to look around. You cant say to yourself, 'I wonder what kind of damage happens if I concentrate all of my railguns on their engine', because as the battle starts if you are just staring at the enemy ship, watching the light show, so many other decsions have to be made. How are my drones doing, how are my missles doing, should I launch more, how much damage am I taking, should I change the angle of my ship, how is my weapon range, is the enemy closing or moving away, how much ammo do I have left. Having two ships to baby sit makes it even harder to watch the damage to the enemy ship. All of this kills the enjoyment factor when the battles only play in real time. Maybe a battle replay would help too. - Above I mentioned that 'the battles seem to play in real time only' because I am not really sure what all of the keys do. Other reviewers have mentioned this. There doesnt seem to be a list anywhere of the keyboard layout. I even did the old 'run your hands across the keyboard randomly' just to figure out some of the keys. This is the year 2016, come on.  - There is no quick save, or at least I cant find one (maybe it is hiding with the keyboard layout). Once you start a mission look at the orbits, make some burns, line up a perfect interscept, start battle, BAM ! Forgot to turn my ship to broadsides. START THE MISSION OVER FROM THE BEGININNG. Now the player has to rework the orbits and the timings, make the burns, interscept, start battle. Draw, no one won first pass. Neither side has fuel to try another pass. START THE MISSION OVER FROM THE BEGINNING. As the missions get harder, this is more of a pain. This makes it very hard if not impossible to try new things. Trying new things means starting the whole mission over. After a successful, hard mission, you dont feel like starting over just for the sake of trying something new, you just move on to the next mission.   - I wish it had a campaign more like KSP's career mode, where money and what you accomplish really matter. You are just dropped into these crafted situations that dont really matter in the long run. There is no 'long run', but I knew that going into this game, it is just wishful thinking. The author of this game does such a good job of thinking things through, maybe a grand strategy version of this game would be bleak. The strategy game probably revolve around fuel transports, fuel producion and depots. I think it would quickly end up like the BattleTech universe where the first few wars whipe out so much so fast, all of the warring sides would come together and agree not to attack some targets (jumpship yards in BattleTech)(and they agree not to ues weapons of mass destruction).  This post is getting too long, I will come back later and edit after I have played more.   Summary - interesting, science based space battle sim, not like KSP, graphics are fine (easily improved in future), needs a quick save, need to be able to change the rate of time in battles, UI could use some polish, needs a sandbox campaign of some sort. Even though I gave it a negative review I think of this game as 'early access' with improvements yet to come ... ( and I dont mind supporting games like these)   P.S. Edit begins here - After playing a few more hours , I have more thoughts : the more I stare at the orbits screen, the more I shake my head. I am currently on the 'Homecoming' mission and it seems like a waste of time to make the player worry about complicated orbits and picking up some general (the mission is to return your ship to Mars, from a far away asteroid).   I hate to even mention KSP, but I think KSP makes figuring out orbits so much easier. In comparison, KSP shows you how fast you are going and your orbital altitude, and CoaDE primarily uses your delta-V and an orbital picture. So in KSP you are staring at numbers and in CoaDE you are staring at an orbital picture.   In CoaDE you adjust your orbit to the target, the intersect icon appears, you click 'intersect', BAM!, warning not enough delta-V remaining (or there is a warning that the mission's time limit is up). You say to yourself, 'Ok, my orbit path is wrong, I can't do that. Hmm what is really wrong with my orbit ?' Because CoaDE doesnt use numbers (or any other hard information about your orbits) you dont know EXACTLY what to do adjust to make a perfect intercept. The only thing you have to work with is the orbital picture showing your path.   Long story short, this leads to a lot of trial and error adjustments, pretty much making random adjustments (or series of adjustments). You slowly learn how to make better paths, but the game does not teach you why that path is better. I looked for help on YouTube and found a playthrough of the mission I was having trouble with, and that guy was just making random adjustments, all the while talking to himself sort of saying 'ok I know what I need to do, how do I get the game to do it'. To make matters worse (or 'easier') you can base your path on the orbit of your target. This displays your orbital path as a curly q line, which can make it easier to intersect an orbit, but it makes it harder to understand the consequences of your actions (your actions dont matter as long as the curly q line ends up where you want).   P.P.S. Edit #2 - I feel my review has a few too many negative points so I wanted to add a few positive moments that have hapened in the game. I have played up to the 13th mission Vesta Overkill, but I have switched over to playing in sandbow mode, creating ships and modules (you can unlock the design aspect early if you find the right menu in the game). Most of my weapons revolve around nuclear bombs.   There is something satisfying about designing and detonating a 3.25gt (3250 megaton) nuclear missle in the middle of an enemy fleet. I have also designed a cannon firing 4.4kt nuclear bombs that are about the size of Coke bottle (10cm x 40cm), at about 10 rounds a second. It seems like nuclear bombs will dominate the future too. I have spent most of my design efforts trying to guard against nuclear bombs, by upgrading stock ships so the AI has a chance.",

            "review_text": "It's OK. I think I like it, on the balance, because there's nothing else like it except perhaps Kerbal Space Program.  What's a bit disappointing is that it's basically a series of set puzzles, rather than a cohesive game. Each level is a battle or rendezvous with a vessel or whatever, and each feels totally isolated and out of context from anything else. This is reinforced by the fact that each level has a high score and a gold/silver/bronze medal for how well you solved the puzzle. It all feels a bit contrived.  But a lot of that is just my expectations and hopes upon hearing 'it's a space strategy game but with orbital mechanics' compared with what the game sets out to do. I was hoping for traditional RTS or 4X elements where I'm gathering resources, building fleets, and sending them off myself to other areas of the solar system to fight my enemies.  So why the thumbs up for all the whining? Because what the game actually is it does pretty well. It's realistic space combat.  I must point out that it's very niche. If you're an avid Kerbal Space Program player then this game is for you. If you're not interested in learning orbital mechanics hands-on then you won't get anything out of it, so don't bother.",

            "review_text": "For the short version, skip to the TL;DR part at the bottom.  First off, i've never played Kerbal Space Program or any similar space simulation game; i only watched my neighbour play KSP a bit since i'm interested in the general topic.  I bought Children of a Dead Earth (CoaDE) on a whim a couple of days after it's release on Steam after noticing it's trailer in my recommended videos feed on Youtube. Even though i don't have a background in such type of games and i'm no (astro)physics buff, i have enjoyed playing it; not only becouse of the gameplay but also becouse of the information and knowledge i gained through playing it.  There's obviously a lot of stuff that players of KSP already know about, like orbital mechanics, Lagrange points, Hohmann transfers etc.; in addition to that, CoaDE also includes space combat and various weapons which brings a new (dark) facet to the spacefaring simulation side. As the player progresses through the campaign, which also includes some interesting treatises on human nature and war in general, the possibility to design one's own spacecraft and further on even individual custom modules becomes available; that's where the simulation part explodes (pun intended) - you can literally design your own custom nuclear reactor, laser, nuke or rail/coilgun, learning the basics about how they function on the way.  While the game is - according to some other reviews - rougher around the edges than KSP, the added space combat and integrated module editing parts should probably leverage that out. If you're in to astrophysics and/or hard sci-fi, this game will almost certainly bring you the money's worth on those topics.   TL;DR  PROS: - indepth simulation of astrophysics, various spacecraft components and weapons - campaign includes a couple of nicely written parts on human nature and war in general - the campaign missions are mostly fun to figure out and improve on, if you're in to astrophysics puzzles - genuine educational value in the relevant topics - nice soundtrack (i didn't even know about Nigel Stanford until now)  CONS: - the UI and the general graphics are pretty barebone; if you need eyecandy to have fun, this isn't the game for you - some of the missions are tough to figure out on one's own, especially if you have no background in KSP or astrophysics - occasional crashes happen, but the developer is actively working on fixing them (see patch notes) - currently Steam workshop isn't yet supported, but the developer said he will work on it in the future  If you're in to astrophysics and/or hard sci-fi, this game will almost certainly bring you the money's worth on those topics. However, don't expect flashy graphics or an intricate campaign; this game puts accurate simulation first and everything else second.  Updated for the award ;)",

            "review_text": "Children of a Dead Earth is the newest game with a catchy title in the genre of space combat simulator, with an extra heavy emphasis on the 'simulator' aspect of the genre. It was designed to incorporate all of our modern, proven technologies and explore how space combat might look if we were engaged in it today.  The gameplay has a campaign and a sandbox. The campaign consists of several challenges that progress a story. The sandbox is basically a free mode that allows you to create battles to test ships. The real meat and potatoes of the game is the ship and module designers. The ship designer allows you to create and design ships from base modules, arranging components and weapons, and deciding on armor. The module designer is like a series of miniature simulators, which allow you to design ship components. Need a new engine? Design one, and see if you can get what you need. All of the values and numbers are pulled from equations actual engineers use when designing these components. All of this adds up to a simulation that is very strict but rewards lateral thinking and good designs.  I highly recommend this game to other huge nerds.",

It's got a great premise, and is obviously something the developer really cares about, but they've made style choices that just don't make any sense. Combat is lightning fast. Most fights (once the shooting starts) don't last 60 seconds. Some can take less than 10, yet there's no replay, no pause, and no way to slow things down to issue intelligent orders.   This is supposed to be a design decision becuase they want combat to be realisticly fast, but in the end it just makes for a terrible game experience and an even worse simulator. If I could replay the fight in slow motion I might at least enjoy it as a simulator, but as it stands I usually have no idea what worked and didn't at the end of the battle.  Until the developer adds some much needed features, it's not worth the cost.  ",
