            "review_text": "As someone who played this game to platinum three times on the Vita (thanks, stacking region trophy lists!), I find it to be the best Neptunia released in the West yet. The gameplay is simple to grasp and fun to play and the script is the best yet with quite a few funny moments, which is a huge step up from the very first game's cringe-worthy reference overdosing every few seconds. The English dub is also very good.  Just one note: the cutscene portraits weren't scaled up, which is quite noticeable during cutscenes, particularly against the much crisper backgrounds. It's not a dealbreaker, but it may bother some people.",

All EX Move from all character watched... All Nepedia monster database completed... (no more ???)  Hmm it seems I am finnaly Done with this game.  All jokes aside. I really didn't think Neping would be so addictive.  Think back about this game. The graphic would be 9.5/10 for cartoon type. The Jokes of this game made me taken many screen shoots and spit coffee at my screen twice. The sound is repetive but after so many hours played it didn't feel repetitive. The Achievements was really easy to get and the only one that's hard is to get 100 Million gold. About 1/8 of the dialoge of this game have pretty good voice acting although i wish it would be completly voiced. There is only about 1 fighting animation at the beginning of the game. The rest of the game is just cartoon and dialoge.   On surface this game seems to be a basic JRPG that feature girls that sell skin and make a simple/pedictable adventure.  And i fully understand several video game site only rate this game 60/100. But somehow behind all that silliness of the game there is a successful Nep that everyone would love.  A lot people would say this game is too cute for them but please give it a try. This game really made Cute into something nice and fun.  9/10",

            "review_text": "Starting off by mentioning that as a remake it is simply amazing. As for the original, it was done on a very low budget so I will forgive it as being slow, lacking and a bit difficult to play. It introduced the world to this franchise and I must admit im still wondering how it got on. But now that were here im glad it did. Re;Birth1 is refined and fine tuned to be an excellent game as one itself. Using the original Victory battle system ( wich to me is excellent ) with its easy to use and yet very detailed interface, Re;Birth1 really is one relaxed game battlewise. As for the characters we've been introduced a few new ones and left behind some. The cast itself is very interesting at best. Following an amnesiac Neptune trying to get her memory back and then stopping Arfoire and everything else fishy. The series music is great as always. Catchy and fun to listen to. This game has the original Re;Birth plan system wich is a very decent system. It allows you to create items varying from battle items to actual costumes and effects in the game itself. There's alot to be done in this game, and at its very low price its a must for anyone who's interested in some JRPG action.   Pros + Enjoyable story + The always brilliant Neptunia cast + Great music + Great battle system + The plan system + A lot to do if you want everything done ( plans, equipment, etc. ) + Very easygoing and relaxing game  Mixed   +/- It can be quite easy  Summarize: An excellent, easy to approach JRPG with amazing features. ( Definition of the word REMAKE! )  10/10 ",

            "review_text": "When I first started playing HyperDimension Neptunia Re;Birth I wasn’t sure if I liked it or not. The story and character interactions seemed somewhat reminiscent of the Disgaea series. As I’m a rather large fan that series I was sure that the story would keep me going through the game. But that wouldn’t be enough to make me recommend it to friends.   That first night I put about two hours into the game advancing the story and figuring out the basics of the combat. The second night I played about four hours and advanced the story. The third night I started doing the mini-quests and messing around with the dangerous enemies in dungeons. I had about twelve hours in the game at that point I had just finished chapter three and started chapter four.   I’m now thirty hours in and just started chapter five. The story seems to be a little short but the amount of side content is huge. At this point, I’m very happy with the battle system and still find enemies in the side areas to reasonably difficult however the enemies in the story line dungeons have been trivialized due to my doing side goals for so long that I’ve wound up severely over the level the dungeons are designed for.  The odd part it I didn’t find myself to be grinding the whole time I was collecting drops from gather spots or enemies for items or weapons. The few times I wasn’t doing that I was trying to do the dangerous monsters to challenge myself.   The Combat in the game is designed really well preventing you from face rolling through enemies unless you’ve really leveled up. The combat uses a three attack type system divided by break, power, and rush. Enemies have a guard bar and a health bar while the guard bar is intact they take reduced damage from all sources. This is where break attacks come in they do minor damage to health in exchange for dealing high damage to the guard bar. Power attacks are the opposite they do a great deal of damage to the hp but almost no damage to guard. The rush attacks focus on building the EXE gauge which deals with finishes and large damage super attacks.  The game is absolutely a blast for me and I wish that I had heard of the Neptunia series sooner. I highly recommend this game to anyone that is interested in it. It also has plenty of references. “Go Ancient Dragon, I choose you!”  Tl;dr The game is a blast but it’s easy too get lost in side content and make the story content to easy. Totally recommend this game for anyone that enjoys comedic story’s like Disgaea or games with some depth to the combat system.",

            "review_text": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a game that, while flawed in some critical areas, can still manage to win over players with its sheer amount of charm and character, videogame reference-based humor, and a solid set of combat mechanics.   The story is loosely based on the Console War, with cute anime girls playing the roles of goddesses to landmasses that are based on Sega, Nintendo, Microsoft, and Sony. The idea is neat, but the environments never really truly capture the 'spirit' of any of the companies being represented and there's a real lack of creativity in bringing these lands alive in that respect. Which brings me to the game's biggest issue: Its lack of variety in locales and recycled dungeon designs. You'll see nearly every type of environment in the first 5 or so hours of the game, and from there, almost nothing but repeats, which will also be the case for most enemies and bosses as well.   Combat is turn-based and fast, and you're given a myriad of options on how you want to outfit your characters' equipment and combo loadouts. Boss battles can be long, drawn-out, and at times strategy intensive ordeals that rarely, if ever, require grinding to overcome.   The progression in terms of the game's difficulty is a fairly balanced curve most of the way, with the player given many opportunities to tip the balance into their favor by either gaining a few extra levels, or utilizing the game's 'Remake' system which can allow you to craft new items to buy, add more powerful enemies to duneons, and change what items appear. Again, there's not much grinding involved at all in order to complete the story, and most sidequests can be ignored if you so choose.   The only real grinding in the game involves needing to run back through areas to collect items which may be necessary to craft new Plans you've come across. The game leans a bit hard into this system and it at times can drag things to a screeching halt, but again, beyond the basics and a few nice things here and there, you don't necessarily HAVE to engage with it.   While flawed, Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a solid JRPG and will more than please those looking for something a little different in the genre.",

It may be a budget JRPG but it's a well done one, though keep in mind the focus of this game is the characters and humour, if these don't resonate with you I can't recommend the game.  It's a turn based RPG so that may turn people off and there isn't much in the way of exploration but with its 'remake' system finding items and crafting new features to add to the game can be quite addictive, it's a unique feature I'd like to see in more games. Hyperdimension Neptunia provides a fair challenge that should help keep your interest while playing.  As mentioned above it's the characters and humour the provides the greatest entertainment of this game, it's full video game parodies and jabs at video game culture but you can tell it's done by people that love gaming. The characters at the beginning can be overbearingly cute if you're not used to more Japanese flavoured games but each one of them has a unique personality and develops well through out the story. It would be generally shocking if you left this game without liking at least one of the characters.  It's definitely for the JRPG crowd but for those wanting to try something different this isn't a bad place to start.",

            "review_text": "HyperDimension Neptunia is a series that you will either love or hate. If you are not willing to look past the fanservice and suggestive aspects of it, you will not have a very good time. However, if you are willing to look past those, you will find a series full of well-written and developed characters and a large amount of meta-humour that is hard to not get a laugh out of.  To start things off, Neptunia a JRPG. In the world of Gamindustri, there are four nations: Lastation, Lowee, Leanbox and Planeptune. Each nation is ruled over by a goddess CPU (Console Patron Unit). CPU Black Heart rules Lastation, CPU White Heart rules Lowee, CPU Green Heart rules Leanbox and CPU Purple Heart rules Planeptune. The CPUs reside in Celestia, where they are locked in battle to determine who will obtain the title of True Goddess. After hundreds of years of fighting, a strange voice suggests for Black Heart, White Heart and Green Heart to group together and defeat Purple Heart. They agree and send her careening off the edge of Celestia towards Gamindustri, during which she reverts into Neptune, her human form. After being found and tended to by an aspiring nurse named Compa, it is learned that Neptune has amnesia, and so she, Compa and a member of the Guild named IF set out across Gamindustri to restore Neptune's memories. The story is very lighthearted and rarely takes itself seriously. The characters are all well-developed and likeable, and their conversations often involve the breaking of the fourth wall to hilarious effect.  Gameplay-wise, the game is relatively solid. It uses a turn-based system where you move you characters around the battlefield before using their abilities or using combos. Combos are composed of Rush, Power and Break attacks. Rush attacks are more effective at building your EXE Gauge, which allows the use of EXE Drives. EXE Drives are very powerful attacks that can be performed alone or with other characters, depending on which character is using an EXE Drive. Power attacks deal the most raw damage out of the three, and Break attacks are better at decreasing an enemy's Guard Points. When their Guard Points reach zero, that enemy will take around double damage for a short time.  In addition to the three characters on the battlefield, you can pair them with another three who will provide passive bonuses such as more EXP or increased defences. When two characters are paired together, they have a Lily Rank that shows how much those characters like each other. As the Lily Rank increase, more bonuses become unlocked between those characters. Some characters can even perform EXE Drives together if their Lily Rank is high enough.  In conclusion, HyperDimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is an excellent game if you are able to forgive/look beyond the sexualized aspects of it. The characters are likeable and believable, the humour is great and hard to not laugh at, and the gameplay is fun and surprisingly deep. I recommend that anyone who just wants to have a good time purchases this game.",

            "review_text": "Update: After 51 hours (Excluding hours I left the game running and didn't play,) got all the Achievements for the Game. I enjoyed this game so much that it's literally the only game I actually bothered to do Achievements for. Also the first Game I actually decided to do the Trading Cards for. This is definitely a great casual Game worthy of many playthroughs.  Really surprised with this title so far (14 hours into the Game at the time of this post.)  The Story is quite... Interesting. It is not your typical straightforward story. The Basic plot is that the CPUs are in the middle of a Console War. Yes, a Console War. This is where your Story starts off. If you can comprehend that and the fact that the game has a lot of 4th wall breaking context to some times insult its players and have wacky dialogue, the Story is for the most part Satirical all the way through, which is very interesting, and I actually like it.  One main piece of advice I can offer to any one interested in Re;Birth 1: I recommend one of two things.  1. Watch the Anime. (The Anime is an adaptation of the Game, and takes place some time after the other games. Main reason I list this is because it's a good way to get used to the Characters, and if you can handle the wacky / cheesy dialogue in the Anime, you'll fit right in for the Game.)  2. Grind. Grind. Grind, and buy Item Upgrades / make the Upgrades VIA Plans at every opportunity they become available.  People say that this Game is pretty easy. Maybe if you played it before it came to Steam, that is understandable, but this Game is by no means easy. It is actually VERY hard / some times frustrating.  The Game runs Eight Chapters. If you are not grinding / purchasing upgrades at every opportunity, you will notice how hard this Game can be when you get halfway through the 2nd Chapter. The other problem is that the Bosses have a lot of RNG to them, where they can either do a Normal hit to you, a Powerful hit that might kill you, or an Attack that hits all of your Party Members in close range, even if they aren't even in front of the Boss. Reviving your Party Members when they get downed is also RNG, because from what i've experienced in my own Playthrough, the Boss likes to immediately attack and kill the person you revive almost 90% of the time before it switches to one of your other party members. If you're coming into this game thinking that you'll blow through it without using Healing items or Game Over'ing at all, you're in for a rude awakening.   Get used to how the Dungeons look in the first two chapters of the Game, because you're going to be seeing them all the way until the End. I can't knock them on this because if you can tell already that the Game doesn't take itself seriously and that it mocks a lot of things, especially in the Gaming world, you could see this as them mocking Games that use the same Layouts constantly.  Soundtrack is also pretty decent, but a lot of areas unfortunately use the same background music way too often. Can't knock this either for similar reasons that I listed for Dungeons.  If you can get past all this, this is definitely a very fun game, albeit very challenging as well. Would definitely recommend to any one that likes JRPGs, and I look forward to the rest of the Series coming to Steam.",

The story is as follows and it's basic and simple, go find the Key Fragments that reside in each of the four nations to get your shares and other nations shares back up. The thing is some of the CPU's may be hostile and choose not to help Neptune, so Neptune just goes to find them herself with IF and Compa.

Pros  - 1080p 60 fps, native controller support, no crashes in game, borderless windowed support (1080p upscaled to 1440p in my case), and none of the usual console port problems. - Skill system felt enjoyable to mess around with, and there weren't many skills that just felt so good or broken that they were the only viable strategies for certain portions of the game. - Hilarious dialogue, lots of gaming culture references, superfluous amounts of satire/puns. With terms like HDD/CPU, names of the cities (Leanbox/Lastation/Lowee aka XboX/PlayStation/Wii), numerous characters/dialogue a character who's entire existence is to contain references to Steins;Gate, and incessant 4th wall breaks, I was endlessly amused at the writing. The humor is quite cheesy, but I like cheesy humor.   Cons  - Very unimaginative dungeons. They are not randomly generated and some of the later ones are literally copy-pasted with some different mixes of enemies. There is literally zero puzzle solving and the exploration might as well not exist. It's also impossible to know the leveling of the zones/dungeons aside from just kind of 'remembering' the recent ones to gauge the leveling potential. - The menu is a huge pain to navigate. Items aren't sorted alphabetically or aren't in many logical orders. You can't do something as simple as buy a weapon and equip it on the same screen, etc. Most of the out of dungeon UI navigation is very cumbersome. - Have to be sure that my controller is on when I start the game - The game consistently crashes when I start it up if it isn't the first thing that I open on Steam. This might have something to do with the fact that I consistently play with a controller? Anyway, I always had to quickly exit Steam if I wanted to play. - Large lack of information in-game. It took me a long time to even find out what the stats do! A lot of mechanics are not transparent at all, which can get quite annoying. - The 'plan' system is pretty necessary for item advancing/crafting, but some of these parts have a large chain of item hunting that gets really tough to keep track of due to the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ menu. Break out that pen and paper, I guess.  I'll add a neutral point that the save system is very similar to the ones from older games. You can save during the menu outside of a dungeon and at other save points prior to boss fights and such. It might take some time to get back into the habit of saving as often as possible. You can easily lose some progress if you enter an event and it involves a boss fight, which is very annoying the first few times.  Overall, the game feels like it should have come out in the early 2000s. It reminds me a lot of a 2001 game called Dark Cloud. I enjoyed Dark Cloud a couple of times, but i definitely became more aware of its glaring flaws/shortcomings as I got older and played better games. Additionally, the road blocks in the game can't be overcome by many skillful execution or innovative ideas; instead, you just grind to get more levels. In that regard, it's extremely similar to Pokemon. Since I grew up enjoying both of those games, I think that's the only reason I really enjoyed this one.   At the end of the day, I'd give it a 6.3/10.",

Battles are turn based with the ability to run around and choose attacks, and the plot is incomprehesible about some game-land where there are 4 goddesses, one of which gets ganged up on and booted out down to the land where the mortals are, where she is rescued by another jiggly chirpy girl. But youre not here for the plot.   If you're an otaku fanboy looking for your waifu, or you're a weeaboo, you'll love this game. I'm not so sure on my end, cuz I'm not really into the whole scantily clad anime female fighting other scantily clad females as the ♥♥♥♥ jiggle away.  But for what it is, and for people that are into it, its good. So I'm not rating it down, with the caveat it is VERY japanese and VERY anime moe RPG. If youre into that, you could do way worse than get this game. If youre not, the chirpy voices and fanservice will annoy you quickly.",

If you don't mind grinding, this game has the perfect amount of everything that any anime has ever had. The story is hilarious. Most of the cutscenes are told in VN form, but the few CGs are pretty good. Also, I will say that I HATE dlc. If it doesn't add anything significant (like skins and such) I personally despise it especially if it cost more than .50, but this is one of the few games where I will say BUY ALL THE DLC. The two character DLCs are AMAZING. One of them is a kawaii girl and the other is a flat chested boxer. Both are very powerful, but not too OP that you can use them the entire game without a challenge. I highly recommend you buy this game. It is amazingly fun. The only problem I would say is that the Mouse and Keyboard controls suck. Play with a contoller.",

I figured out that when you recieve the DLC characters it can cause a save corruption. the way around this is to get one of the characters from the event after the first boss, and then save. repeat the same steps with the second character. If you get them both at the same time for some reason it causes the game to crash the next time you try to save.  dont lose 3 hours of game time like i did.  also when i updated my pc I lost all of my 6 hours of progress. So effectively I have to start over. I have not found a fix for this yet unfortunately. But I will try to figure it out soon.   Overall this game is great, and you should definitely give it a try. just be careful to backup your game saves.",

R8 8/8 m8 time to masturb 8 1+7 :) A friend gifted the latest title to me as a bit of a joke... *Plays game super attentively* ***3 hours later*** Bought the rest of the games thanks to the massive black friday sales. I couldn't believe I hadn't discovered the gaming series before! I'm now addicted. Inner weeb levels are approaching over 9000!!!!  === No Spoiler Review === But for real. Its like 1/3rd visual novel (with high quality voice acting) 1/3rd kawaii final fantasy (and nothing like FF10 part 2, that was trash) and 1/3rd fan service (depending on your.. preferences of course).   I've been pleasantly surprised that the game itself is actually a challenge. You may have to grind at some points in order to beat bosses or change up your game style a bit to progress through back-to-back boss battles. Unlike most JRPGS, the grinding is actually fun and addicting in and of itself. The story and characters are all cute, funny, and well-developed (in more than 1 area... hehehe). Also, the music never gets old! Battle themes, dialogue music, the intro song... they're all very polished sounding. Legit production quality.  Honestly the only let-down I've experienced so far is a recycling of monsters and level designs. It does take away from the immersion a bit when you find there are variations of essentially the same dungeon only pathed slightly differently and with recolored monsters. There really is a lot of recycling in those regards. I'm pretty forgiving about it, but it does annoy me. To make up for it, there are a crapton of character customizability options (cosplaying outfits, weapon plan creating, changing your combos, etc) that is really nice to see in a JRPG. I really enjoy the battle mechanics because, as the game difficulty gets harder throughout the game, you really have to plan your attacks to make them count. Its also nice that the battle system isn't a linear ATB, rather akin to games like the Star Oceans and Tales series you can move around freely within a battle scene to position yourself strategically. It is a turn-based battle system, but unlike the goofy stagger system Final Fantasy 13 TRIED to utillize but failed miserably at, HDN has a guard-break mechanic that doesn't require an hour of playing just to proc once like the game-which-must-not-be-named-but-i-already-named failure title used.  Overall, its a really cute game with just as much substance as cuteness to supplement.  I got the game on sale for $7 but even at its normal price of $30 I would buy it in an instant now that I've been introduced to the HDN brand and am in love with it.  Pros: = Story = Characters = Music = Excellent Voice Acting (option for Japanese or English) = Battle System = Character Customizability = Challenging = Easily 40+ hour 1st time playthrough = Whether $7 or $30 it is worth every penny  Cons: = Recycle a lot of monster sprites = Recycle a lot of map textures/layouts = Might want to switch your steam friends list to 'offline' ecks dee! Not everyone can handle the weeb cuteness.  9.1/10  The only game franchise that could possibly be better than this one would be if Dark Souls and HDN somehow had a baby in 4k graphics with virtual reality hardware. Hmmm  === Spoiler === Noire is proof 2D &gt; 3D Kappa no Kappa :3 Edit: I've now played through Re;Birth1, 2 and 3. As it is with most things that come in threes, the first is good, the second is okay, and the third is the best. However, this game sets the foundation for the characters and universe necessary to fully appreciate the other titles.   P.S. This game took my Steam Review virginity. #Worth",

I had to grind till i was lvl 17 to stand a decent chance. now dont get me wrong i dont mind grinding, but when you have to grind nearly 10 lvls just to be a match and hafta use ALOT OF ITEMS IN THE BATTLE, its kinds ridiculous. and to put this calculation into perspective for you(once you hit lvl 12 you have to kill everything in the valley 2wice to get to lvl 13 so you can imagine this was a long process. and im not even gonna mention the dragon in the valley other then dont try to fight it till you reach lvl 25 (min). so for a score 9/10 for storyline but 6/10 for gameplay &lt;--mabey a little too generous. and lastly for those who wanna know. DLC does not make the fighting and gameplay broken. i kinda wished it did (or atleast made it easier for me) so for a overall score of 6.5/10 for the game. not a bad way to waste time if youve got the 'memory' for it.. haha",

The four CPUs of Gamindustri are in a bitter fight for the title of the 'True Goddess'. This battle however has been fought for several hundred years already. When a mysterious voice appears to three of the CPUs, they team up to defeat the remaining one - Purple Heart, Neptune - and knock her down to the main land...  If you have already played other main-series titles of this game, the gameplay is pretty much the same as always. For those who don't know, there is a generic overworld from which you access the dungeons, shops and other instances, the dungeons themselves where you can walk around, collect items and fight monsters. Encounters are - rather than being random - based on 'symbols' which are enemies on the dungeon map. For combat you can set 3 characters to fight at the same time. During each character's turn, they may move and choose an action (attack, item, etc.). The CPUs still retain their transformed state, HDD, which increases their stats.  And then there's even more stuff you can do, but that's nothing worth noting here (and nothing that would change your mind).  The grinding isn't as bad as many people make it out to be; a little tactic can help you out. And there's fan-service. Nothing all too significant, but it's definitely there.   Do  give it a shot if you have no idea what this is, if you know and like the series or you're just bored.  Don't  if hate the series or Anime in general.",

The story begins with 4 sister goddesses who were born from one original one (possibly the Atari?). However, for long as they can remember, the 4 goddesses engage in a long battle and eventually, Neptune gets knocked out and sent flying to the land below. She loses her memory like a stereotypical JRPG character and begins finding a way to regain her memories, only to eventually unite all 4 goddesses together to fight the main enemy.  The story overall was mediocre. Despite all of the cracks about consoles and poking fun of various game/anime stereotypes, (the characters are all a form of one) the game itself was ironically still one. However, it's all about the characters and they're all unique in their own way. Of course, there's a lot of fanfare and random breast physics. Like how IF has jiggle physics is beyond me..But it's there. There's no real 'movie' sequences in the game, but only still pictures that only use those jiggle 'physics' to compliment the sequences. However, although there's a bit of fanfare, the game doesn't focus TOO much on breast jokes. There's a bit more game jokes as the game centers around the idea of poking fun of console wars. The idea of having flash cards like the R4 as enemies made me laugh.  The music makes you feel as if you're in a digital Japanese setting. Though I'm not a fan of JPOP, I kind of enjoyed the music in the fields and for some characters which were all more instrumental. The opening and ending sequences made me groan.  What helps this game shine is the battle system. It's turn based, but it's fast paced and flashy. You choose sequences of attacks, or a special move to either break the enemy defense, or simply deplete the health. By breaking the enemy shield, your attacks will do a lot more damage. You also build an EXE meter which allows you to unleash devastating attacks to enemies.   The difficulty of the game bounces back and forth from ridiculously easy to managably hard. There was never one time where I felt like I had to adjust my strategy to make the battle easier. You'll just need to grind some levels to make sure the enemies can be defeated.  There's a huge cast of characters in this game, most of which will join your team. Like any fanfare game, there's also a number of costumes and accessories for your characters. You want the swimsuit? Well, yeah, that's there. There's also costumes that are inspired by certain characters of various anime/games as well. Most of the items are created through plans where you have to grind out materials for. The materials aren't tough to get either. You won't have to grind out the same monster several times before getting one piece you need.  It was pretty easy to reach 100% achievements for this game. Maxing out your level doesn't feel like much of a grind, especially since there's some enemies that give a ridiculous amount of experience. Overall, I was happy to give this game another chance and it managed to get me excited enough to play the second one when it releases on Steam. ",

            "review_text": "Damn it all, this game has brought out my inner weeaboo. Other than the anime style though, all in all a great well rounded, fun RPG. Stunning looking special moves, awesome HDD Transformations (Basically Mega Evolutions), no overly complicated battle interface, simple as you have a certain area that is shown that you can put damage into, how you aim it depends on whether or not you will take out 1, or take out 5. Story is compelling, full of comedy, puns, and many MANY references. Fun Plan system which lets you alter the game however you like. Enemies too hard? Use the Plan system to weaken them and give you a little edge. Enemies too weak for your tastes? Turn that ♥♥♥♥♥ up to 11 with the Plan system. The Plan system is basically like built in mods, that you unlock over time. You like character customization? Boom, there are different outfits for all the useable characters that not only change their clothing, but their hair color and eye color...... Ok I will admit it's not the BEST character customization, but it's still fun in it's own aspects. The game has a great leveling system too, each new dungeon you enter obtains enemies that are not only stronger, but actually give out enough more exp than the enemies in the last dungeon that you don't hit a ceiling, and end up having to spend a good amount of time to gain just 1 level. An example of this is, you need to gain a total of 40,000 Exp to level up, the enemies at the most recent dungeon give out around 2,000-3,000 Exp per battle. At most takes about 10-15 minutes to level up your characters. (Did I mention as long as they are in your party and are alive, they all gain equal experience? It's like Exp. Share from Pokemon, but actually an EQUAL share. Cool right?) All in all I'd give this game a 10/10, Great, compelling, comedic, all around amazing story along with a great battle system and cool looking special attacks and HDD Transformations, with great plot development, fun and challenging boss fights, tons of references from titles such as Pokemon, Space Invaders, (an anime that has a contract signing little pink thing, I forget the name of it), comedic stereotypes, and a fair share of fourth-wall breaks, leaves this game as a must buy game for almost anyone! Definitely my new absolute favorite JRPG game. I've had it for barely a day and a half, and I already have 18.3 hours spent into this beauty. 10/10 would recommend, definitely worth the price. 10/10 would binge-play this game.",

I also came to love anime and all things cute. This game combines those and adds a lot of media references, grinding to unlock items to play dressup with a large cast of characters, and a metaphorical story about consoles fighting against piracy.  The controls are awkward and take some getting used to, only about half of the English VO was ever done, and the combat can get a bit repetitive.   In spite of the issues it has, I have enjoyed more than enough hours of playing to say this is a great game.",

Gameplay side aspects are great, the combat mechanics, crafting, questing, grinding in general are very well implemented.   The whole Gaming Industry analogy thing is also amazing.

Going into deeper details, Anime art has always been my thing, and even though in 3d it looks very nice! Character designs go from hilarious to badass and everything in between, while still feeling like it all fits (caught me off gard the first time I played to.).  One of the major features is the HUGE amount of stuff to unlock (you will never get it all in one playthrough.) And everytime you play through the story you get to keep your items and levels, and while you will most of your characters, everytime you unlock them again, they have there levels back.

From start to finish it's fun, and even after beating it you'll probably still have the urge to play more and 100% it since it is just way too much fun to nepnep.  A really enjoyable semi-turn based/semi-action combat that has a lot of weapons and unlockable buffs/debuffs to tune the game to the dificulty you want. The game does not use random encounters instead opting for the 'touch the enemy on the map then go into mini-arena' style, but if you really don't want to fight enemies you can also unlock a buff that lets you attack the avatar of the enemy and kill it without entering the battle.  The story, while simple and pretty cliched, is really fun. The characters are all well written with lots of hilarious dialogue and references weaved so well that I'm sure many people won't even notice half of them.   The only cons I could possibly think of are the fairly repititious environments and the voice acting, but I don't actually mind the English voice acting. I actually think all of the VA's did a great job, but if that isn't your cup of tea you can always turn on the Japanese VA's with English subs.  Overall 8.5/10 Will nepnep again.  .....

It has some of the best sound tracks I have heard on a JRPG for the PC that I can rock out to like a 90's head banger. This kirin is in dance mode everytime I hear the opening theme. THAT SAYS ALOT! The graphics are 2d in for the encounters yet the disloge is just too funny that the shallowness of that style melts away. The combat is 3d with a combo attack system that is not only easy for the keyboard but makes it a blast to slam out quick burst action. Too bad you have mess with button configuration the work with WADS+QE but when you have it it feels like a PC MMO not unlike FF14! Maybe the developers can hot fix this?

The Good: +Top Nep-nep +Tons of jokes on cliches in anime and gaming (even some that slip the translation) +Fan-service gallore +Enjoyable combat system +Great sounds and music +Dual audio options  The bad: 1: The english text is based on the english voices, there is no english text that translates for the japanese ones. Some jokes and sentances are very diffrent, this is pretty standard in translations.  Annoying at most.  2:Compas voice *Japanese*, I just... no... Healers are mandatory and I love the fact that there are hybrid healers, but she is such a big part of the game overall.  3:Shoe-horned Tutorials. They explain mechanics that won't be relevant untill 20 levels into the game right from the start. You get an EXE drive gauge very early and it keeps telling you to use it and you even get it upgraded to 2 bars before you even get anything that can use it.  4:DLC characters makes early game trivial. Argument 'Don't use them'... however they could have been added to your party later. Around level 35 they normalize with the other characters in my experience.  5:Jumping. Add an option to atleast turn that off, it was nice and novel the first 50 times I jumped.",

The massive amount of grind might work in asian markets and especially with game on hand held devices, but it's a little too extreme for a version where the player is stuck sitting at a PC.   The enemy difficulty doesn't scale nearly enough as it should. I know I know. People hate enemy level scaling!   Combat quickly becomes tedious through the endless grind and enemies quickly stop offering any meaningful challenge. Even the stronger enemies end up dieing with a single attack, so you end up spamming the button to skip animations just to get the fight over with as quick as possible.  You can continue to unlock things after you've finished the story by playing through New Game +, but it's even more boring and tedious. Replaying through the exact same story again with characters that are already over leveled for the content. I don't think completionists will enjoy getting 100% complete on this one.  My review might seem overly negative, but I actually really like the game. It just could have been even better. I'm not really sure if I'd say it's worth the full asking price though. If you see it on special, definately give it a try!  ",

Gone are the days of crappy combat with random chance to heal yourself (Yes you couldn't even use healing items yourself!) and pointless interactive dungeon items, instead you have something which is a lot more fluid and fun to play. Something people gloss over is how the remake now has you collecting the other CPU Goddesses as allies as early as Chapter 2! The original had 3 party members including the main character for literally 80% of the game, the diversity allowed a lot of spicing up with formations and picking favourite characters early.  Definitely worth playing for the writing more than the gameplay, but the remake is a real hoot. It won't win any awards, but It sure is a lot of fun, Neptunia is adorable.",

            "review_text": "After playing (only) over a 100 hours and having the true ending and normal ending, I thought it might be about time for me to write a review for this great game. I'll put a pro and con tl;dr below with some additional points included.  First off, I've gotta say that the story is pretty good, albeit very basic for most parts. The premise is what's special, with the world being Gamindustri and the 4 countries representing Sega(Planetune/Planeptune), Sony(Lastation), Microsoft(Leanbox) and Big N(Luwee/Lowee). Each of them has a goddess(called CPU in the often more than just purely stupid localization, more on it below), which represent the consoles of the seventh generation of their respective nation, them being: Neptune(the cancelled Sega Neptune), Noire(PS3), Vert(Xbox360) and Blanc(Wii). Then their are also some backgrounds to the world of course which'll be part of the story, but barely anything but basic stuff. The Main-Antagonist Arfoire actually represents the R4-Module in the localised version and all kinds of similiar stuff in the original(read: Japanese version/spoken text) with her name being Majekonnu there. The most special part of the story is the constant 4th wall-breaking, especially by our MC, Neptune.  Next up I'll talk about the gameplay. Although it's called a JRPG by almost everybody, I'd rather call the fighting system a TBS, most reminiscent of Super Robot Taisen/Wars NEO for Wii, but wether you know it or not, I'll elaborate: Just like in classic JRPG-fighting-systems you and your opponent take turns dependent on AGI, and have multiple Attack-Options. Here comes the difference through. On the characters turn you actually walk around with them depending on their corresponding stat and depending on the weapon you've got a range for attacking. When an opponent is in range and you attack, you actually start a kind of simplistic Combo with 3 types of attacks where you can set different ones in the menu and of course learn more through leveling up. You can chain up to 4, with the first 3 being of the basic-types and the 4th being a special Combo-Finisher, for which you've gotta increase the so called EXE-Gauge by attacking the opponnents. And then there's also 2 special attack-menus, one being for normal special attacks and spells, while the other is a type of finishing move and also includes Team-Moves. You can use these instead of starting a combo and the range of effect of them is undependent on your weapon, and differs per Skill. You can take up to 3 girls into battle, and each of them can have 1 support, with whom they can tag out during battle, receive support from them and (in certain cases) do special Team-Moves.  Now I'll come down to the fanservice: Panty-Shots sometimes appear during the fights(if you change your camera-height accordingly), and that's it for them mostly, if not completely. Dialouge-wise there are some small things and then there's the rather cute flirting of   IF and Vert  , but since it's more cute, I won't even really call it fanservice. The biggest part of fanservice might be the jiggling breats(even almost flat Blanc-samas ^^') during the CGs. That's about it, maybe a few things here and there in the dialogue, but not neraly as much as is often exaggerated here.  And then there's the design of everything: The characters are all distinct, and albeit most of them being rather equipped with tropes, none of them are empty characters. Remember folks, tropes are NOT inherently a bad thing, it's more like the opposite unless handeled poorly. After all, a character that fits NO tropes will ALWAYS be completely without any distinct features.(in case you think otherwise, prove it to me and I'll add an 'ALMOST') The design of the dungeons is done really good, optically. NOT A SINGLE MAP IS IN EXISTENCE TWICE. However, most of the same type are very similiar to each other. Take note, that 'same type' means the same textures and stuff. Now for the worst part of the design through: The Monsters. While each of the base-types is designed really well and almost - if not absolutely - all are references to the one or other thing, the annoying part is the over-using of the same model. Now, that would be absolutely fine imho if they were always recolored. But there are only a few recolors of them all, making for way too few models. The first dragon you can encounter actually uses the same model as the one in the last dungeon, not even recolored, but the names differ, and only them sadly. But, over time you'll get used to that. Actually, it's not really annoying at all, just a minus point I had to mention.  Lastly I'll go over the localization briefly. Most of the time it's done quite well. Only a few things are omitted here and there in comparison to the spoken japanese text, and a few times completely senseless or useless stuff is added in the sentence. The worst thing is, when the added things are making a character appear ooc(out of character). This actually frequently happens with Neptune in the localization. While she's kidding around most of the time, the localization has her ooc quite often. Everytime she uses slang except at the start of the meeting Falcom in Planetune. But that's still on a bearable level in this one. A bit worse is the handling of Compa's 'Monster-san'. Whenever she says it, they just omit the '-san', which in itself is absolutely ok. BUT one time during a scene where she actually tries to call the seriousness back they made 'Mr. Monster' out of it. Now, if she would've used it from the beginning, it wouldn't do anything to that scene, but like this, it seems as through she doesn't even try to get the seriousness back. That's only 1 example, there are more, but overally the localization is - as I said already - ok. Some references are changed out to make more sense to a western audience, absolutely ok for a localization. Although I almost forgot the worst point of the localization, which are the jokes. Often you can be sure the joke you're reading is absolutely out of place AND context, or just completely added. This mostly gets done to NORMAL sentences, and for example Neptune's 'take nep'-thingy and the 'Pika' were NOT existent in the original, she said normal stuff in place of these. The only other really bad thing is the changing of terminology. Here's a list of the top of my head: 'Basilicom' actually was 'church', nothing else. 'CPU' was ALWAYS 'goddess', NOT 'CPU', NEVER and actually is quite senseless... 'HDD' is completely senseless as well, if not even more than 'CPU'. The original said 'Megamika', which roughly would translate to 'Goddessfication', or for the sake of making it flow better in english sentences, 'goddess-form'. These are the most prominent things, there likely where some more senseless changes.   Pros:",

Pros: +Bright and rather pretty colors sometimes +Voice acting is decent at times +Character animations are decent in battle (Note how specific this is)  Cons: -The characters are just tropes. Quite literally. They are fashioned after tropes 100% which makes nothing about them memorable or interesting. You could say that this is fine because that's what they were meant to be, but really, if your goal is to make bad characters and you succeed....congratulations! They're still bad characters.  -Everything is a reference. There is only a tiny fragment of originality in this game. Again, that's the point of the game, but it really shows just how weak it is when 99% of the enemies you fight are nothing more than references. You'll fight a Mario Pipe, a Tetris block, a literall screenshot from another game. Also there will at times be cutscenes that serve no other purpose than to be a reference to something else. No other purpose, whatsoever.  -Being that so many enemies are just objects really, enemies have very few animations. The pipe will just kinda lean forward and bump into you. So will the slime. and the screenshot. and the tetris block. It's incredibly boring.  -The art itself for backdrops/locations is bland and repetitive.  -Finally, the BIGGEST issue that I have with this game...it is not balanced to itself at all. It's one of those games where you can kill all the enemies in an area without getting hit and you barely get exp for them anymore, but yet the boss will manage to almost one shot you. (Example: fought regular enemy in the area. Got hit for 138 of my 3000 max hp. Went up against the boss. Was getting hit by 2000 every single turn) And this is the case with EVERY. BOSS. I have grinded, grinded, and grinded some more and I still have more grinding to do before I can inch my way through a boss fight. I also have to have a huge surplus of healing items ready at any given time because the actual healers heal is way too weak for the amount of damage bosses can do. this game is not balanced to itself in any way and it makes it one of the most frustrating jRPGs I've ever played.",

            "review_text": "I was curious about JRPG games and had been wanting to give one a try. I investigated this one because the title sounded like they named it by picking random words out of a bag and didn't quite know when to stop. I then looked at the Steam store page and was left with no idea what the game was about but I suspected it was probably something to do with breasts.  When I started playing the game the plot was introduced through the medium of text boxes and fan service. My first impression of the gameplay was how poorly the controls had been ported to the PC, specifically how I couldn't configure the mouse movement to control the camera movement as would be most natural for me. I soon gave up on using a keyboard and mouse and plugged in a controller. Once I did that I found the gameplay was pretty solid. It has a good turn based combat system, a range of fun characters, amusing fourth wall breaking dialogue, loads of customisation and upgrades, dramatic cinematic special moves, a range of cute monsters and bright colourful environments. After a couple of hours I was really enjoying this game.  So why am I giving this game a thumbs down? Well if your experience is anything like mine sooner or later you will run into a boss that will utterly destroy you, you will then have to go and repeat the levels you have already completed until you level up sufficiently to take on that boss. You can then go and take on the boss again and scrape through. The game will then reward you with an even tougher boss who will instantly kill you again with no opportunity to save. So you have to go off and grind again. And that sets the tone for the rest of the game just grinding through the same monsters over and over again till you can progress. The game likes to ♥♥♥♥ with you further by occasionally giving you boss fights you are supposed to lose so you will burn through all your best items in a vain attempt to stay alive. You can unlock more dungeons and tougher enemies to help you level up. There are a couple of problems with this, firstly there is absolutely no indication as to which monsters you will be able to defeat, this means you have to save whenever you get the opportunity. Secondly as if this game was not repetitive enough pretty soon you will realise there is only a handful of environments that are reused throughout all the dungeons and the monsters are reused with slight colour variations over and over again.  If the game was just flat out too difficult I would have abandoned it but my desire to finish what I start combined with knowing I could defeat the next boss if I carried on got into my head so I couldn't stop playing. If this game was stripped of all the grinding it would probably be a very enjoyable 10 hour game but instead I am left resenting this game for wasting 45 hours of my life.",

Another annoying thing is the fact that you have to grind everytime a event is completed before you can continue the story. The Characters are mostly cute and kawaii besides one of them. And this is the one that ruined it for me. Her Name is Lady Greenheart aka Vert and she is homosexual (!?) She is constantly force flirting with one of the other girls, even tho she is rejecting her, Lady Greenheart keeps pushing her into it. I do not find this right in any way. I am a straight female and not into this stuff.  Another annoying thing is that apparently the HDD Mode is basically a cyborg fairy in a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ outfit. The less clothes the Girls have the more powerful. To me this is backwards logic and has nothing to do here.  To the Level design, it is rather boring as it keeps repeating itself.  It seems like this game was only focused on looking 'good' or cute instead off actually functioning properly. Also the Game seems longer than 21 hours, therefore I would say that the price would be worth the hours some of you can put into it.  Nevertheless, I can only recommend this game for any homesexual /-fans and hentai fans. But not for anybody else. Even tho this game seems to have alot to do with cute girls and nerd stuff.

As I have try to solved these problems for days, it seems many people have the same problems. Some can be fix, some are not.

            "review_text": "its okay i guess meh, 10/10   Seriously though;  [I will mention now that I am bias towards this game, so take that as you will, since this will all be my opinion on the game]  Neptunia is a game that's very much orientated towards people who can stand the usual 'anime'-esq visual representation. People who don't usually enjoy that will NOT enjoy this game. That being said, however. People who do enjoy this style of visuals will probably not care either way. To me, the art was okay, but not great. (I did play it before the 1080p update that made everything a lot clearer, keep in mind. This review is based upon my first experience)  The gameplay in Neptunia is similar to that of a standard RPG. Turnbased combat, only you get to freely move around the arena and the combat itself is rather fast paced (If you know what you're doing). The combat seems to be the only thing that holds merit for people who don't want to get into a game that has this artstyle. A friend of mine, who usually can't stand it, admitted to the combat being rather fun. Probably best to warn you that they do ramp the difficuly up somewhat harshly later on in the game.  The story to Neptunia isn't really groundbreaking from any point of view, that I can say for certain. It's the generic 'Friendship brings us together' kinda of stuff, but, lets be honest. We don't play Neptunia for the story. We play it for the fighting mechanics and the gaming references. (And for many possible waifu's).   Even though the game's been given praises galore here, I'm still not going to recommend it yet. The game is currently filled with game-breaking bugs and errors. The devs are working to fix them, but as long as they're in the game, I cannot recommend this. If you don't mind fixing the game up yourself either via compatability mode or other things, feel free to buy this though, it's a fantastic game from start to finish if you sit down just expecting jokes and combat.  Overall, I cannot recommend this game. Like I mentioned in the previous paragraph, the game is filled with bugs that could cause you to not be able to save, have a black screen, make the game crash, have lighting issues and many more. This game seriously needs fixing before it's able to be recommended.  But also, as mentioned before. If you don't mind how buggy it is. Feel free to pick it up for a good 25+ hours of mindless fun.",

Long, long, long, visual novel style cutscenes with bad jokes (Every joke is either a fourth wall joke, some reference to either gaming or otaku culture, or fanservice) Possibly underage character designs in normal form. Badly optimized (It has higher requirements than CoD4, Crysis, Bioshock, and yet looks like a DX7/8 era or PS2 game, while having framerate issues on a 760M) Doesn't support 1080p in windowed mode, borderless windowed mode is unsupported. Controllers are not autodetected, you have to go into a settings menu to enable them. No video settings. Gamepad designed UI. Cringeworthy voice acting (Seriously, look up a gameplay video of this). Poor graphics/art style (It looks like something out of the PS2 era, and yet this is 2015). Dull, repetitive music. Easy, with little/no challenge. Later on however, it becomes an even more boring grindfest.   This game is just proof that Japanese gaming and JRPGs are a sad shell of their former selves. Skip this game unless you desperately want kawaii anime girls. It's not even 'so bad it's good' like Rogue Warrior, Sonic Boom RoL/06, or MW3's multiplayer. It's just pure trash.",

            "review_text": "*Take this review with a grain of salt*  Before I go through this review, please note that this game is not for everyone.   Alright, let's begin.  Story The story was somewhat predictable, yet still good. It revolves around the main protagonist (Neptune), who has lost her memory and slowly brings the main cast together who at first hate each other, but later on become friends.  They then band together to fight an evil person thretening to destroy the world. Relatively cliche. One thing you'll pick up straightaway is the reference to other games and anime. Oh god the references. Also there's fanservice.   Gameplay The gameplay, in my opinion was solid. You don't need to excessively grind, so long as you know what you're doing and not avoid every monster. Strategic placement of your characters is a necessity for victory in the later stages. Great thing is, exp is shared with your entire party. For example, if you gain 5000 exp from a battle, EVERYONE gets 5000 exp, unlike some games which only give the most based on who does what. This significantly speeds up the levelling process. There is also the remake system which I'll go into further detail after.  Remake system Alright, so basically when this game got remade from the original, they changed the storyline up a little and added this new feature called the REMAKE SYSTEM. Basicaly, what it allows you to do is add new dungeons, enemies for those dungeons, you can change the item pick ups, make new accessories and just create a load of stuff. Great addition to add variety to the game.  New Game+ One important feature of this game is NEW GAME+. Once you've finished the game, you can redo the game again and go for a second cycle. This is necessary to get all the added CPU candidates which you can create via the remake system. The good thing is, all your credits, experience, levels and items get rolled over, so you cna go for the achievements that you may have missed in the first run. The bad thing is that enemies dont get stronger at all, so if you're a high enough level, you have no challenge at all (aside from the colosseum).  DLC Please note that DLC is not necessary to get all achievements, so its not a forced buy. The DLC allows you to unlock 3 new characters: -Histiore -Peachy -Plutia And the additional packs give you 300 levels per pack and added dungeons and colosseum battles, so you can go back and have more fun. All in all, you get 3 characters, 900 additional levels and new dungeons if you decide to purchase every DLC.   So to sum up If you're an anime fan, like loli protagonists and have some money to throw at a screen, this is the game for you. As far as I'm concerned, it's worth the money and time that I invested in it and I don't regret one bit of it.  Pros: +Remake system +No endless grinding +Lots of characters +Good variety +Good gameplay +Fanservice +Nice variety of personalities +Good parodies +Great soundtrack  Cons: -Story lacks twists and can be cliche at times -Character voices can sometimes be irritating to listen to -Hard boss fights if you dont grind levels at early stages -Difficulty curve on some parts are too extreme  9.5/10  Once again, it is not for everyone, but I highly recommend this game. Also, this is much better than the original so don't bother trying the original and go straight for the remake.",

Overall, this is a really fun JPRG, but not without its flaws.  There's some typos, some errors with the text not wrapping properly. It's disturbingly frequent, really. I've run into a couple sound glitches as well, like an audible 'pop' before and after silent parts of dialog. There's also one skill where one of the characters seems to use the wrong style of voice depending on their form. Minor stuff, but bugs that were never fixed none-the-less. The game also makes references still to the fact that it's on Vita, so they didn't bother to update it for the PC port. Another strike against it.  One of the most glaring things, though, is that the game seems to have been designed with the DLC's increased level cap etc. in mind. Skills don't really go 'all the way', a lot of characters seem to stop progressing at a certain point. I don't know if they start getting more skills etc. again with the DLC, but it feels like there were gaps left in to be ready for it. There's also the issue that one of the achievements seems solely designed for the DLC, as playing over 70 hours with three play-throughs only netted me 1/10th of what I needed for it. Now, I have no problem with DLC that just adds a bit of extra content. I do have a problem when the DLC feels mandatory for getting a 'complete' game.  All that said though, this game is still well built and fun enough that I don't mind recommending it. And I'll probably look up the sequels too. The characters are really fun, and funny, there's lots of little references. All in all, it was an entertaining experience. So, yea, if you like JRPGs, pick this one up!  Edit: As a note on the repeated play-throughs, it does not take long to get back to the end game using New Game+. You can skip the dialog, and you don't need to do the extra missions, plus you're already high level and can overpower every story enemy in the game. So I had no issues with having to do that to unlock everything.  Edit 2: I have now completed the game with DLC. Some of my complaints above turned out false. The obvious 'gaps' were not filled in the DLC. You never gain more points to put all your best skills on, only limited to the same 400, you never gain any new magic, or ultimate attacks. Though the DLC stuff isn't scaled very well either. Each one adds a new dungeon that's meant for being max level for that DLC. And you pretty much need all the DLC, as bits and pieces leave problems (such as getting the DLC character's colosseum weapons requires all three of the level DLCs). So, still not perfect in that regard. And, leveling itself, you don't go out and fight to level. The EXP pay outs are not balanced for that. They are designed that you find the handful of 'jackpot' payout fights and farm those.",

You can like them pretty fast and get concerned by their story. the story so far is very simple and easy to foresee, but it is absolutely not a major hindrance to enjoy playing, unless you love very twisted and complicated plot (which ones are, of course, enjoyable in other games). The battle system is also pretty fluid and easy to handle, I can only criticize how easy the boss battles can be easy in the story. A very strong aspect of the game is the 'fan service', pretty much like a manga. This is a fair warning against this predominant aspect : if you don't like this aspect of manga, maybe you wouldn't enjoy this game to its fullest. Moreover, be aware that about 95% of the characters are girls.  That's all ! I am really enjoying playing this game, and I hope the next chapter will be available soon on Steam.

There are lots of items and other things to unlock, and you have to play it through more than once to get everything which means there are alot of game time to be had. With that said, if you're sick of grinding and/or can't stand pop-culture references and cute anime girls then this game isen't for you. The game throws in alot of slightly obscure references that you might miss if you're not into japanese culture.  As for the game itself, there aren't really any cutscenes and the game relies heavily on texted dialogue between the characters. It's similar to a visual novel and I would describe it like a mixture of a VN and a JRPG. Combat is turn-based which I can appretiate, it reminded me a bit of when I play Final Fantasy X where you could switch party members in the middle of battle to suit the situation. A thing that bothered me a little is the recycling of dungeons, many dungeons have identical layout which on one hand makes it easier to navigate through but also ends up making the game repetetive. When you add grinding on top of that it really makes you wish for more variety, because after a while I can tell before entering exactly what to expect out of certain dungeons.  Overall I can say I really enjoyed this game, I woulden't have spent so many hours playing it otherwise. However, Hyperdimension Neptunia feels like a niche game that is geared toward anime fans. The plot centers around a console war too, so if you only play on PC it might not be that interesting or relatable. If you're looking to get into the series then this is probably the title you want to start out with. I found that this game had a better introduction than Re;Birth2, even though the games follow two different storylines. I give this game a Nep-Nep out of ten.",

This game is actually hard at times and you will grind a bit to get ahead of a boss or even just the mass mobs in the area. you will be spamming your potions on the person getting focoused till you either wipe or kill the boss. A mistake or a misplaced character will lead to a wipe. This game's combat isn't the best its turn based. You have 3 types of attacks: RUSH, GAURD BREAK, POWER and you can earn more moves for those 3 types and build your own attack style for each character. you basicaly just spam those until you want to use your abilities or your EXE DRIVE(build this one up with attacks). The characters in this game all feel different (so far) and the dialouge is packed with troll pop culture references that even an english crowd would get and just plain old trolling the other characters for fun. The dialouge is pretty random and yet so funny. The voice acting in Japanese is very well done (english anime voice actors make me want to claw my ears out in near everything so i turned the Japanese voices on right away and cannot comment on the english ones). The overall story so far isn't anything compared to a serious visual novel or a novel but i enjoy their journey in this troll world. That reminds me the enemies in this game are so troll it makes me laugh most times i encounter a new one. for example (SPOILERS AWWMERRRGERD) there is a ps4 with legs and a cat face that a legitimate enemy i laughed to hard when i saw the thing. alright now lets talk about the port since this was a vita game. The port is absolute trash like real bad. like so bad but i rebinded keys to know that they do and after a while it doesn't bother me anymore. before you press new game know what the buttons are / do and have them rebinded to like a being 1 b being 2 x being 3 y being 4 or something like that. either way i wouldn't count that against the overall game because i just don't care. overall the game gets like a 9/10 for me so far well worth my money even at full price but get it for the vita if its the same price and you already have a vita.",

This doesn't mean that the story is bad, but the interaction between the characters is what makes this game a good one instead of just an okay one.   The battle system took me a bit to get used to, but once I got used to it, it worked pretty well. The only thing that is still awkward for me is positioning the chars sometimes because of wonky camera settings. This was a bit frustrating at times.   Another point that wasn't needed in my opinion is all the fanservice. I am not really into that and to me it adds something to the game that it really doesn't need. But I know that I am a minority here. Anyhow, if you are looking for a fun and lighthearted RPG, this is worth checking out. I liked it enough that I picked up part 2 as well.",

Obviously its very gud jrpg with op story n' stuff which is definitely worth getting and clearing for those who like that kind of things :3  Main review part: Graphics: Textures are kinda good even if the game was ported from console. Chars look pretty decent, but there no support for 1680x1050 or DSR. Also there is a bug with borders in fullscreen cuz of different aspect ratio which forced me to play this game in windowed mode. (9/10) Gameplay: The most interesting out of those i had recently.. a lot of stuff to craft, enemies to beat, tactic variation is also included... but at mid-to-late game you may notice yourself doing everything under the same scheme of 3-5 things (For bosses if you have super exe drive: 1. use break attacks in order to do guard break 2. spam EXE drive 3. Heal when needed while doing those two.) The Remake system is really new to me, remake world to suit your farming needs is definitely neat.(even if limited) (10/10) Controls: Nothing to complain about if you are playing with controller. But if you don't have one, just rebind stuff up! (10/10) Setting: Everything's OP part II(well... almost) ... Chars are cute, but location variety is at not so op level cuz some dungeons are copied versions of previous ones.The idea is good tho. everything is made not really serious, but self-aware... (10/10) Replayability and stuff: Instant desire to replay the thing! xD (with DLCs that increase level cap it won't feel useless also) and new game plus is the only way to get all stuff... so sure thing...[btw... if you reached like lvl99 or moar, you will be able to win fights you had to lose due to story events, you will get no XP for those fights, but its still funny to win those...] (10/10) Story itself: Again, chars are more than memorable (may create some attraction to one(or not one) of the chars, the story is cool, there is some humor (most of jokes created by creating very odd situations xD) (10/10) EDIT: got true end, it was OP as well! How to self-sacrifice not to die at the end and do the thing you were sacrificing for at once :D   Overall rating: 9.8/10 [S+]  One of the most decent games i have ever played! The only con to encounter is difficulty at some moments which makes you grind, but grind in this game doesn't suck. Must have for those who like jrpgs and being surrounded by cute ppl. 420 Nep it. :3 P.S. Waifu choice = Neptune (but still others are adorable too...)[not much of an otaku -&gt; affection meter is not at max, maybe at 66%] P.P.S. Now my hobby is to read waifu threads about those game series...(cuz its so funny to watch ppl trolling and insulting each other cause of their personal character preferences) I may watch that animation sooner or later too!

Ever wonder what would happen if game consoles were actually transforming magical-girls? No? Well you're about to find out anyway.  Pros - Fun, cute and likeable characters - A funny, silly but engaging story - Unique, turn-based combat system - Crafting system that allows you to, not only unlock new items, but to modify the game's mechanics or add new dungeons - So many gaming culture references you'll probably never spot all of them - Super cool flashy special moves with over-the-top animations! They even let you skip them once you're tired of seeing them for the 100th time.  Cons - Recycled assets are rampant. Recolored monsters everywhere and entire dungeon layouts are coppied multiple times with slight changes - The DLC characters are a bit overpowered  I give it 8.5/10. The game overall is satisfying and fun but you may find yourself feeling like you didn't quite get your money's worth, what with the dungeons re-using the same assets over and over. Its still very much worth your time for the combat and setting up the story and characters for the sequels which further refine the mechanics and have better production value.",

That can be a pro if you want a long game - At first it's unavoidable but later is so easy to miss events or places that you should go to unlock certain dungeons that at the same time unlock others and have items that let you unlock items - If you don't like silly humor and/or highpitched voices you might hate a lot of this game - The variety of enemies is quite small. Most of them will have the same model with different colors to say they are a stronger version - Leveling takes so much grinding at first until you can beat certain monsters without being killed in the process - Making money is the same, hard at first and later you'll be swimming in money (except if you wanna buy some chips that cost millions each) - Once you've gone past certain level, even if you increase the difficulty, everything will be too easy - There are a few DLC colosseum fights that are ridiculously hard compared to the rest of the game  Overall it's good even with those flaws (^_^)y",

I wouldn't get it at $30, but it's worth considering at the $15 range (right now, I haven't seen it less than $14.99).   The story is downright corny. You are in Gameindustrii, and are playing different characters modeled after game consoles. They are at war. They somehow made a storyline around it. So yeah, don't play this one expecting a deep story. There's also quite a bit of fan service going on. 'We love video games!' is seen quite often. Still, it seems that some people like the story, which is fine by me.   I know I'm sounding sarcastic, but to me, a story isn't the only thing that makes a video game. Some people demand a really good story, but for me, it's the package. I did like the gameplay enough to keep going and to try to get the different endings.   The game actually has a decent amount of production value and is an alright light RPG. One thing I do like is when the characters talk and they show portraits, you can see them move around a little and breathe. It adds a little life to the universe. It's subtle, but incredibly effective. I actually do like that some grinding makes a difference in tough battles. Some of the relationships that Neptune makes are actually amusing.   It does help that you can skip battle animations with one of the trigger buttons.",

Though it may not appeal to everyone.  +Fun Characters +Good Combat System +Tons of Dungeons +Loads of Characters +Unique Style +Breaks Fourth Wall  I had the original version on the PS3, even then I loved this game, this version is remastered one that was released on handheld, it uses the more modern combat system rather that the original, same goes for the world map.  This is a really fun game to play, the combat itself consists of special moves as you'd expect but as you level you unlock new combo moves to change your standard attack branches.  Dont be fooled by its fun atmosphere that its going to be a easy game, you will have to grind and work out the best approach otherwise it will wipe the floor with you, However you will get a ton of tutorials anyway explaining in great detail so as a starter in the JRPG genre this would be a good choice.  For those who played the originals, the Re;Birth's have completely changed the combat and story events so its still worth picking up! ",

And make no mistake, this game is full of fan service.   The storyline is an afterthought in this game, it's mainly just a vessel for pushing into repetitive quests. Even so, if you have a moderate amount of anime or video game history knowledge the cutscenes will occasionally make you smile or laugh. References, puns, and the shattering of the 4th wall are all common place in nearly every scene. If you find anime humor entertaining, you'll watch these scenes through most likely.   But if you skip all the humor, is there a game here? Yes.  This is a old-school jrpg grindfest. Tons of quests, tons of items, tons of crafting, tons of visual customization. And with the dlc packs, you can level up to 999.   This game didn't blow my mind, but it definitely distracted me efficiently for 40-50 hours. If you like grinding for gear, you'll dig the huge amount of such activity this game has to offer.  If you don't like grinds or anime humor, this game will likely not be for you.",

Now the game does have its fair share of 'fan-service', which is nice but really it's not one of those games that soley dwells on the fan-service (Though at first glance you might think it does).

The equipment system is oversimplified to the point where you're basically just dressing up anime girls and building up an unreasonable amount of random mob trash and credits to craft and increase your wardrobe because the stat differentials on outfits is basically non existant. The weapon choices follow a fairly linear scaling path, and almost always has a clear winner, so you're kind of stuck using the one the game wants you to use instead of picking the cosmetic weapon of choice, contrary to the wardrobe path.  One redeeming factor is the difficulty of the game, as you can scale the mobs in a menu to basically easy or hard, if either would make the game more enjoyable with no penalties or bonuses for either. It allows you to kind of move through the story at your own pace without getting punished. Also the game runs very smoothly and the battle skill animation scenes for specials are kind of fun to watch for each character for the first few times.  I felt like you didn't get to use a lot of the extra characters for very long in a play through which was a bummer as there are quite a few fun side characters. After you finish a playthrough and move onto ng+ your character list is wiped out until you reaquire them through the story. Also due to skill distribution and character balancing, certain characters are just simply going to be better than others. Rip Compa.  All in all the game was pretty fun for what it was if you know what you're getting going into it. It's just a light hearted rpg that doesn't take itself seriously, with a cute storyline, cute characters, and a little fan service on the side, but hardly any depth on the combat/equipment/crafting side of things.",

            "review_text": "Ladies and gentlemen, I present one of the strangest RPGs I've ever played: Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth 1.  This game takes place in a personified version of the seventh generation console war. If you don't understand what I just said, the three major seventh generation consoles (being PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii) along with the Sega Neptune are litterally at war with each other and are personified as goddesses that rule different lands, which are not-so-subtley named after their represented consoles. All of the characters are actually done quite well too. This game is basically about you (Neptune, who has lost her memories, for the most part) trying to unite the four nations to overtake evil stuff.  This game will bombard you with a bunch of references to many, many, many games; a lot of cheeky fourth wall breaking; and... well... jiggle physics.  As for the actual gameplay part of the game, 'Meh?' is kind of all I can say. The dungeons (which are the only part where you control an actual character) are very generic and could have been a lot better, but this game is a PSVita port, so I understand it (not that it is justified due to that). The battle system at its core is extremely repetitive and simple, though some parts of it are so extensive that it's not even worth tampering with. I just found myself using power and special attacks through the whole game. One thing however, is that the enemies are generally references to things.  Speaking of enemies, this game is very strict about its leveling. The boss fights are a joke if you're over-leveled but they are near impossible if you are even slightly behind in levels. It's actually surprising how they were able to accomplish that.  In the end, you're not really playing the game to play the game.    tl;dr  If you want a whole bunch of game references, cheeky fourth wall breaks, and/or jiggle physics, then this is a good pick for you. While it's an RPG, you don't really play this game for the gameplay. You play it just to progress and get more funny conversations.",

Like I don't remember any fanservice cgs (unlike in .....rebirth.....2....................) like sure it does have fanservice but I don't remember it in a negative way, which means it was alrighty and not completely gross like fanservice anime stuff tends to be-   All in all I'd say:  +story line +characters &amp; writing +humour and nice gaming references (very thin 4th wall too) +nice combat system, esp with the combos etc +challenging bosses +the plan system is fun I guess +very cute kick ♥♥♥ girls with nice character designs  -heavily based on grinding -can't do everything in one playthrough but a second playthrough isnt very worth it? At least not if you have the story fresh in your mind -characters in your party can be a little unbalanced power wise. For me it was never really very rewarding to not have Nep in the party bc honestly that girl was dang op compared to the humans lmao  11/10 it ok",

I advice to play in Japanese sounds a 100 times better then english ",

            "review_text": "There are just two things that I dont like about this game.  *First the translations is really bad done, 80% of the jokes make much more sense in the original japanese than in the english translations, you can notice that if you play the game with japanese audio, they could let it untranslated because the players would understand it anyway, instead of trying to adapt it and making something awful.  *The port is not compatible with windows 7 and you have to play with compatibility mode with windows xp sp2 or you'll get some frame drops.  Taking these two things out, the game itself is really good, if you like the japanese 'otaku' culture and like JRPG, this is a game for you. A fun story, lots of reference, a unique battle system and tons of dungeons and places to grind. Give it a try, you sure will like it.",

The story is fun, the combat requires attention to level efficiently, and if you put some effort into it, you'll find that you don't actually have to grind all that much to proceed. If you're a completionist you'll probably not notice the level grinding anyway as you'll be easily building your girls up while trying to achieve rare drops from boss level monsters.",

Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is a game that you should definitely get if you like colorful, interesting characters and the RPG genre in general. The plot may not be that complex, but the characters more than make it up for it.  The MC, Neptune is one-of-a-kind, not often do you get a cute, adorable, 4th wall-breaking, sh*t-talking, Neppittor, NChanner, pudding-loving meme-lord as an MC. She brings out the best personality traits out of anyone!  In conclusion, just buy it for the neps. (Especially on sale.)",

            "review_text": "Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1 is the first title in the Neptunia franchise, although it serves more as an introduction rather than the 1st in the story (it is its own separate world)  But what an introduction this is.   [Main Setting] Having played most of the other Nep games, this has the simplest and yet strongest story of all, one you are already familiar with: The Console Wars.  [Story] The great consoles of our time give their names to nations protected by goddesses (the main cast) This game depicts a war between nations and the interactions between said goddesses witch drives this simple but familiar plot forward. It is a fun ride beginning to end. And although Neptunia is a parody/comedy franchise this setting gives you a feel of epicness as well.  [Visuals] What you see is what you get as they say, anime style graphics, cute cut-scenes, over the top special moves and plenty of waifus ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)  [Audio] English voice acting is surprisingly top notch, the performances fit each characters personalities. Battle themes are very epic and dungeon music is relaxing.  [Gameplay] In traditional JRPG fashion, you grind your way through various dungeons in turn based combat, completing quests or hunting for rare loot. Party composition is very important as having characters with balanced abilities (AoE, healing, magic damage) is more important than grind. Different endings and New Game + included.  [Synopsis] If you are an anime fan, like JRPGs or want to see your favorite consoles duke it out in a war for supremacy in a world where Neptune destroys the 4rth wall constantly, you only have to ask yourself:   'bro, do you even Nep?'
