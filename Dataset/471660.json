            "review_text": "The feeling of painting is close to spot on, it's very imersive and precise. Only spraypainted acrylics, a case and rims in real life, but the feel is there. Paint reacts in ways to expect it to.   Haven't notice any of the performance dips or desyncs others been complaining about.   The medium spray can could be improve at low trigger pressure and the 'lowest pressure can' needs to be a bit stronger overall. Squatting to get lower, but would be nice to step on something to get a bit higher. Lefthanded option is also rather important.  The game is good overall; I can paint, save and load without a hazel. The only real annoyance was the delay/silence of the release itself.",

            "review_text": "If you´re an artist: get this title. If you´re creative: get this title. If you want a cool place to hang out and be creative: get this title. If you are reading reviews because you´re not sure if you should buy this title: get this title! If you got 'Vive Spray' and you where sort of dissapointed and you think that spraying graffiti in VR isn´t cool: Get this title! This graffiti sim is simply awesome, you´ll love it, I do and I never did graffiti in my life before and now I can´t stand a day without it in VR!!! Simply imagine how cool it is, to have an unlimited amount of colors, spraypaint, a boombox and cool people to hang out with. This is what the reinvention of a medium should be. VR is the Gesamtkunstwerk already, this is simply amazig! I have to be honest and say that Kingspray Graffiti VR excited me more than TiltBrush, because here the materiality of spraypaint itself has been accuratedly simulated in different spaces that let your creativity flow in unexpected manners. No wonder after the release of Kingspray Graffiti VR even TiltBrush was updated to paint in 2D!!! The price is like one and a half cans of spraypaint and you get unlimited! And now, GET THIS TITLE!!!  It still requires some performance tuning in my opinion, but it´s so well done and with love to the detail that you can forgive it and be sure that it will be taken care of. This title has made my Vive priceless.  My very special thanks to all the people involved in making Kingspray Graffiti VR, you´re awesome. Make more!  My Suggestion: It would be great to be able to hold a Stencil with your hand and spray with the other, I know it´s a challenge, but it would make it even more awesome! Great street artists combine stencils in their creations and that ables them to bring them to another level... You could have some cardboard and spraypaint on it and then cut that out to make a stencil of your own, or load one by placing it on the directory just like the projections... I know it means a lot of work but please consider it.  See you on the rooftops...",

            "review_text": "Is it perfect? No, not quite, however, it actually works fine on my machine with undo/redo turned off. With undo/redo turned on there is noticeable hitching. I don't even worry about undo/redo though. I paint a solid color for a background and if I screw up, I just sample the background and undo it manually.   I tried Vivespray briefly and I can tell you that this is better in its current state. It seems like the devs are trying to fix the issues people are experiencing, so let's see how patch #1 goes. Hopefully it will fix the bugs so they can focus on a few more features. I'd like to see some straight and curved edges I can hold in my left hand to use for masking.  I'm running on a i7 6700k, 16GB Ram, 980TI, 1TB SSD.  ",
