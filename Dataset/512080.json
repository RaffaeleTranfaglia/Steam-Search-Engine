            "review_text": "OK, I've made two seperate attempts at this, each one was for 12 minutes for a total of 24 minutes so far.  The first time was so overwhelming that I was literally falling over as I took the huge jumps into deep valleys. My stomach was in my mouth, the way a rapid drop from heights would do (not VR sickness). As I hit the ground in VR, my knees and legs were instinctively trying to balance me in real life. SO hard to explain. I took the headset off and giggled. The experience completely fooled my brain.  So, about an hour later, I tried again. This time I kept telling myself 'this isn't real', and I was able to actually play and enjoy it. Within minutes, and after crashing multiple times, I totally got it. Bending your knees, and leaning is the key to this. When flying thru the air into a deep valley, and a massive boulder is in your path, all I can recommend is either lean over far enough to avoid it (you seem to have control while catching air), or CLOSE YOUR EYES as you smash into it.  I highly recommend this for those that want to crash dive into building VR sickness resistance. Once you build up tolerance in this VR sim, you will be able to play in VR game that uses motion to move around. Hopefully developers will stop thinking we're all a bunch of pansies, and start making games that we can 'walk within the VR environment', like these guys developed.   Good job developers. But, it needs polish for sure. Like please include menu options to disable 'in game' music so I can hear my own music.   ",

            "review_text": "Great VR experience. First time slamming in a rock at high speed resulted in me landing on my floor. And it wasn't just me, as I watched my friends do the same, good times. After some runs and being more stable on my feet I can really enjoy the huge jumps and high speeds, great way to move forward compared to the teleporting you'll find in most other places.  On a more critical note, as a game it does have just one track, and the bird attacks are annoying at best. Skis are not always in the right position and steering left and right could be improved upon so it does not just track the tilt of the headset, its sideways movement should have more impact on steering.  I think the price is acceptable for this small game, I have seen much worse VR games and experiences in this range and above. This game is easily one of the best VR experience so far, which has provided lots of fun, sweat and tears.",

            "review_text": "This was headed straight for refund after 5 minutes of play, there didn't seem to be much fun in hurtling along seemingly out of control and slamming face first into virtual rocks. I put it aside to show my partner, thinking if she managed to stay upright and in control of her stomach she'd agree with me. She saw there was a score to beat however, even my paltry effort so that was an incentive to persist. It still feels a bit intense but not in a VR sickness kind of way, my partner felt a bit queasy but it passed and we've figured how to actually steer and not just crash into things.   It's a fun game that's worth the price, gfx and frame rates are good on a 1080 and there certainly is a sense of speed. Just don't show it to your grandparents as their introduction to VR.",

I could not even stay in the game long enough for steam to allow me to write this review.  Not worth 10$, maybe worth 1$",
