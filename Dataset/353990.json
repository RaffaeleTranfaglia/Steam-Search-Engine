            "review_text": "The game starts off a little boring but its to get you to understand the game better and then it starts getting better little by little. The gameplay has a little bit of the Zelda feel to it. The crafting reminds me a little bit of Minecraft as far as placing materials in boxes in a certain order to make items. The game is a little buggy but not bad enough to not play. Only downside is that the gameplay is only 2.5-3hrs but based on what is said at the end, it looks like they will be adding more to this game. Overall the game seems to be worth it aslong as they add more with updates.",
