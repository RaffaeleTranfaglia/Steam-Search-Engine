Looks to be useful, although I'm having trouble getting some of the voices to not sound tinny.   So my 'after playing around with a few minutes' review... program does what it says, I see little hit to processing speed (which is good). The voice doctor could use a little work (I was getting some line-in interferene, causing some extra static, it would have been nice if it could recognize that... I think my tinniness is it adjusted with the voice doctor assuming that the interference was part of my voice.)  Overall, I have to say pretty good so far, I recommend it.",
