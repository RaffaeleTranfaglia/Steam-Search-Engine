            "review_text": "Play time ~9 hours  (Originally recommend No, so that developers see this).  I am very grateful that the developers have put out a game with the intention to raise awareness of the injustices in today's human society. The game portrays that injustice very well, but I believe more effort could have been placed in condemning the injustices and fixing it also, rather than simply placing the protagonist (and others) in the shoes' of a victim. Moreover, there are some references to animal experimentation which I feel is inappropriate - another injustice that yet again is not condemned.  From a game mechanics / gameplay, perspective, the game is very good. It puts together multiple puzzle mechanics to bring a complex new type of gameplay not found in any other game I've played. Although the mechanics are fixed, there are new twists being thrown in consistently, and this provides a variety of gameplay. I thoroughly enjoyed the puzzle aspects.   Regarding visuals and audio: superb. The game is beautiful in both regards.  The game is also good at storytelling. The reward system for beating challenges means users are fed bits and pieces of the story and I believe this works very well.",

            "review_text": "An awesome concept turned into a fun puzzle game. Project Temporality puts the player on a futuristic space station and has you go through 14 chapters, each with its own set of puzzles that require you to use time clones to be solved. It might seem like a confusing mechanic at first, but don't let your first impressions deceive you. You perform a route that you'd want a clone to take, then you rewind back and create an alternate timeline. At this point, the action you've done already will be performed by a clone, whilst you can go on to perform another action.  The game lets you create up to 10 clones per chapter, and hence 11 timelines in total. Many of the puzzles require you to use more than 1 clone, creating a very smart and dynamic gameplay, which encourages you to think several moves in advance. It really reminded me of The Swapper (another good puzzle game), except in 3D rather than 2D and with more control over your clones. The puzzles themselves involve security doors, timers, keys, buttons, lasers, and moving platforms - things you'd expect in many puzzle games except executed with a lot of originality.  Some of the latter puzzles start involving more complex mechanics such as temporality fields, which cause a door or a platform to remain where it was even if you reversed time. Regardless of complexity, solving each and every puzzle felt very rewarding. There was not a single puzzle in the game that frustrated me or made me turn to a walkthrough.   The game also gives you a star rating out of 3 for how well you did the chapter. Creating each timeline causes you to use up some energy, so the less energy you use overall, the higher your rating will be. This is pretty good for perfectionist type players, though from what I noticed, it is pretty hard to earn the perfect 3 stars on a level, or even 2 stars for that matter.  The visuals are very colourful and shiny, and do a good job showing a futuristic setting. The music is also really great and relaxing, perfect for when you need to concentrate on solving a puzzle. The game's story is mostly told by reading various data pads around each level as well as two characters communicating with you from time to time. The story is on the background mostly, so don't expect something akin to Portal 2 here. I think a lot of reviews, both critic and user alike, are very unfair for judging a puzzle game based on its story, when the main focus is on solving puzzles via time manipulation.  There were a few minor problems I came across, but they did not detract much from the overall experience. Like at times you could get stuck, mostly if a door closes the moment you walk through it, but all you need to do is to rewind time back a couple of seconds and you become unstuck. I did notice some big frame drops in some areas (with a lot of sunbeams), but this might not be the case for people with more powerful computers. I also found myself unable to complete chapter 13 the first time round, since I used up all the clones by the time I got to the very final puzzle in it and it was too late to rewind it. So the only way was to restart the chapter from the beginning. Gladly, once you know the solutions, you can blitz through the puzzles much faster. The devs were also kind enough to provide chapter selection, so you can play any chapter at any time, even if you haven't reached it yet.  Overall, I greatly enjoyed this game and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes puzzle games or the concept of time manipulation. I've had a very fun and rewarding experience playing this game. No doubt it's now one of my favourite puzzle games.",

            "review_text": "Since I'm pretty enthused about this game I'll try not to be bias, and give an objective reviiew.  Pros:  +The Game is highly entertaining and the puzzles are stellar. +Graphics are quite suffficent for a game of it's renown. +Puzzles are quite relaxing and exciting at times, never a dull moment.  Cons:  -The 'Story' is a little bit vague without the logs and they're completely optional and are actually not even hinted on how to read beyond the contextual icon. This seems like a poor development.  -Continuing off the Story there appears to be no enemies/fighting, atleast as far in as I've gotten; This detracts from the idea of a 3rd person puzzle because at the very least you should have some crazed robot out to get you. This only has 'testing' - and if I want 'testing' - I can just play SE for hours on end. So Like I said the stories not so great. -As far as I can tell there's no 'real' multiplayer - just you and your clones :(.   All in all would I recommend this game? Yes, to the right person. It's definitely not a GTA-styled game even though you may be lead to believe that by the screenshots. And to answer your question about open-world the 'tests' are divided into levels - not exactly open-world to me...it is definitely a good game, not sure if I'd pay $15 for it again but what's done is done...",
