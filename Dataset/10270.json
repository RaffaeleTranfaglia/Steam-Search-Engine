Dwarfs are missing, I know the history on how the developer went bankrupt and all, but here is an example of a team/person who knows how to develop this series. Sad that good franchises end this way. I hope someone will continue this one. Reincarnation is great, but could be much better if this would have been the first one out instead of the prior ones before this.  If you are new to the Disciples series get this one and not the others and you will enjoy it, well worth the current price. If you are a long time fan well it is not Disciples 2 but, as I you may come to like this version of Disciples 3. Worth the price to try and see.",

            "review_text": "Highly recommend this game. For those who disappointed with Renaissance and Ressurection, this game is nothing like those 2. The developers made very good revisions and improvements before they go down, and it really worth it. The biggest issue is game balance, and it can be easily adjust through modding as the game is very customizable, and you dont need to be a computer geek to learn to mod. There are plenty of mods in the forum that fix game errors, bugs, and imbalance, and bring in new elements to game play.   The only real downside of the series is the discontinuation of the Mountain Clan. I hope that the game will generate enough sales so that it can be continued, and our favorite Mountain Clan can see the light of day.",

Completely rehauled from the ground up, with entirely new balance, campaigns, and even new types of abilities(cast on hit/cast when hit etc) it is everything disciples 3 should have been. I can not recomend this game enough to anyone who likes turn based strategy. This game puts HOMM to shame.",

Hard boring and wasting a lot of time upgrading soldiers! ur soldier must reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier, before lvl 5 ur soldiers are toys! save and reload! wasting a lot of time! u cannot enjoy a smooth game play and the story! the neutral units are blocking way everywhere and u cannot even beat them because ur toy soldiers are weak!!!! also, comptuer has greater chance to cause critical hit: kill ur soldiers in mere 1 hit!!! HAX! ( such as neutral unit Male Griffin: almost 100% critical hit is that fair??) i already said ur soldiers are toys, which means greater chance to [miss]! when fighting against neutral units! this game makes me disappointed! I am huge fun of disciples! Disciples 2 is epic, but well disciples 3 Reincarnatinon ....i have to say: hehe!! when i writing this i played 10+ hrs, but i am still at the beginning of the empire quest! i feel bored. i don't want to carry on! bored to death when upgrading my toy soldiers!  well i was pretty bested by the male griffins ( neutral unit )! dat almost 100% critcal hit and kill my toys with mere 1 hit! this game is so vicious that we have to reach lvl 5 to achieve a higher tier! and when u made it, guess what u will find ur precious skill points of ur toy soliders disappeared without a trace! r u kiding me? what do the developers want? wasting our time?? they seems so vicious to prolong the gameplay time by making some vicious design! i was a fun of disciples! i played Disciples from 1-3! but never saw a Disciples game so vicious like this!! u k wat i feel now! bored to death when upgrading my toy soliders! toys are toys! before lv 5 ur soldiers are toys! Pls nerf Male Griffin  Also i need to chill........i must be responsible for my review so i came to edit this when i am chilled down &lt;My wish for this game&gt; I am a huge fun of Disciples from 1 to 3, just cannot stop playing it! but on behalf of all funs these years i have to say developers pls make ur game more epic,( not ....u k wat i say)! pls don't prolong gameplay by doing that! guys u must fix it! otherwise no one will carry on because u bored them to death. if u want ppl to say u game is good, at least ur game must give ppl the great passion to keep on! pls try XCOM enemy unknown(2k games) and see the difference.... (try the new DLC enemy within) and tell me which game give u a better feeling to keep on??  IF it is not the end, i think the developers are planning to make a new DLC: Return of the mountain clans!!! If not this game has not ended!",

            "review_text": "If you played Disciples and/or Disciples II, and did not like what Disciples III had become (Disciples III: Renaissance and/or Disciples III: Ressurection), give Reincarnation a try! Same goes for fans of HoMM series, this version of Disciples can give you a fresh experience.  This is the most recent and best developed version. Reincarnation binds all Disciples III content together (Renaissance + Ressurection), with heavily revamped maps, completely changed gameplay(Back to the old style, more like the first 2 games), and is not as unforgiving as before. (Ironically the first mission of the easiest campaign(Imperials) was the most difficult mission in the game) Maps are now a lot more open, you're no longer limited to a single path, and enemy armies twice as strong as you no longer come for you after just a few turns. If you are used to the challenge Disciples Series has given so far, I do recommend highest difficulty, as the only downside to this version is the challenge has been lowered considerably - But this is also a huge upside, as some missions and places simply were too difficult (I do enjoy a challenge, like old skool games gave, but at some point it's no longer fun to either keep restarting from scratch or act like a save junkie to abuse your way trough a single battle.)  I've spend hundreds of hours on Disciples II. Had so much fun with that. Then when Disciples III came, I never thought I'd enjoy a Disciples game again. So much had changed, for the worse. Luckily, I was not the only one who thought this way. The community worked together with the devs to bring out Disciples III: Reincarnation, the way Disciples III should have been in the first place. It's just too bad a lot of fans of the series will never even know about this. I reckon most will easily confuse this with the earlier Disciples III games, unaware the game changed so much in the meantime.",

Because I want it to play on Net but when its looking for something, its show me error: there is no game. Will be there a patch maybe to fix it? Just asking ^^",

I am trying to run it on a high-end gaming PC (nVidia 970M, 16GB RAM, plenty of hdd and ssd space, lots of processing power, no other nonessential processes running in the background) and I can barely run this game at medium settings, which are only one step above 'low'. I tried messing with all combinations of video settings, and the game still failed. When I tried googling for documentation to troubleshoot this problem, all I found were a few words about Disciples 2 that stated that one must enable Direct3D in the graphics settings. Sadly, there is no such setting in Disciples 3.  As such, the game is essentially unplayable to anyone with a fairly new computer. I'd strongly advise against purchasing the game.",

Yep, your options are to play the simplistic campaign or a hotseat or network multiplayer game.   I'm a gamer so I don't like when game companies go out of business but if this is representative to the games they made it is no loss they are gone.  Something I just noticed is pretty much nobody has any real hours into this game. That should speak louder than anything else.",

The AI will gobble up mobs (and almost always be higher level), yet when you fight it behaves incredibly simple and very easy to predict/control. There is very little deviation in troop layout, the battle maps are extremely small, and movement is very limited. All combined makes for almost no deviation in strategy. You'll find one (maybe 2) strategies that work and that's it! Don't bother trying to have fun, just repeat the same strategy for every single fight and walk around the map some more. Oh wait, sometimes you have to buff your army before a fight. I guess that makes it refreshing and new.  I really wanted to like this game. I liked the first 2 Disciples, and I like the HoMM style of gameplay. The graphics are nice too. But, this game is just broken.",
