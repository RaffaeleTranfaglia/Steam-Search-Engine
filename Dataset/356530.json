            "review_text": " 'We are made wise not by the recollection of our past, but by the responsibility for our future.' - George Bernard Shaw   Hanako Games has been a remarkable name in the otome genre for quite some time now. As being one of Hanako's later games,  The Royal Trap: The Confines Of The Crown  is a marvelously elaborate adventure of royalty, politics, romance, intrigue and alliances in a late medieval fantasy realm - and probably Hanako's best game yet in my personal opinion.  Our story revolves around Madeleine Valois, a noble born young woman coming from an insignificant family, raised to attend Prince Oscar of Ocendawyr as his valette - a companion, an advisor, an agent and a maidservant. For the occasion of Princess Cassidy's  aniversari  - a celebration for the coming of age and a hosting various suitors to secure her future - Madeleine accompanies Oscar to the neighboring kingdom of Gwellinor. Considering the validity of a female heir is the central power for royalty in this setting, an already fierce race for the hand of Princess Cassidy is on. Yet, Madeleine will also find herself in a web of intrigues threatening not only the integrity of the crown, but the security of her own and her companions. As dangerous gossip concerning many secrets runs within the halls of royal palace, Madeleine tries to choose her allies carefully for her own means. Will she manage to dissolve the web of intrigue, or simply become a part of it to survive?  Overall,  The Royal Trap  is one of the best otome games both in means of an original setting and story elaboration that I've ever seen. The world and its various ways are depicted befitting 16th century power politics through heirs, names, titles and land with many anecdotes appropriately arranged into a unique setting. All characters are portrayed well beyond skin deep with profound personalities and background. They all are depicted with certain demeanors to establish certain means with unique abilities; possessing dreams, aims, insecurities and hopes which makes every one of them interesting and credible as a personality, breaking out of common stereotypes. Even the most ordinary of them possess their own depths with well written story elaboration.  Our protagonist, Madeleine is most certainly not our everyday shy and helpless heroine. She is a relatable and able personality with her stature, her training and her character. She is a smart and strong young woman who keeps both her wits and her charms about her. An incredible social player with an ability to observe, analyze and assess situations in the blink of an eye. She is calculating with a novel sense of duty and responsibility, yet she still carries her own worries and desires for the future silently. Her chosen interactions are various and always consistent with her traits. Our job here is to reveal what part of Madeleine's substantial personality will become victorious by the end through our choices. Each and every ending you may acquire feels probable and satisfying with the given personality, which is a masterful feat to accomplish in this genre.  For display purposes, artworks are genuinely beautiful anime style and CGs themselves are various with suitable expressions. There is no voice acting for any part, yet the soundtrack already establishes a rich and driving atmosphere through a gripping narrative - both describing actual events and commentating on Madeleine's train of thought. It's like reading a really good story with beautiful pictures presented on the side.  The game has 15 different endings - and a truckload of choice options - presenting alternatives for Madeleine's future and each one sheds some more light to the secrets within palace chambers. I'd highly recommend playing  The Royal Trap: The Confines Of The Crown  for every otome gamer and for whom would appreciate a good visual novel about court politics. Enjoy!

            "review_text": "Without a doubt, The Royal Trap is one of the best visual novels that Hanako Games has ever produced, if it isn't one of the best VNs in general. I played this game first when it came out on the developer's site and got very immersed in the story. As others have already explained the basic storyline, I won't repeat that. Rather, I'll point out what I loved about this game and why anyone who is fan of visual novels should include this one in their Steam library.  First, the story is fantastic. It is one of those rare ones where the female protagonist is actually smart and has quite the personality. The flaw in some VNs is that the female protagonist is a clean slate and can come off appearing like an idiot. However, that certainly isn't the case here. You play as Madeleine Valois, a valette (assistant) to the prince of a small kingdom, and her job is to have her prince presented before the princess of another kingdom and make him appealing enough to be married to the princess. In the world of The Royal Trap, it is the women who have the power because they can hold property while the men have to compete for the privilege of sharing that power. Of course, things don't go exactly as planned and there are definitely hiccups along the way. But enough about that, as I did state that I wouldn't reveal the storyline. ;)  Along with the story, the artwork is beautiful. The background art was completely redone for the Steam release. Although I liked the background art before when the game first came out on Hanako Games, I absolutely was in awe when I saw the new art here. All the extra effort to make the game as wonderful as it can be certainly paid off.  Also, I liked how not all of the paths are necessarily romance paths. Personally, I wouldn't classify this game as an otome one because not all of the paths are romance ones. There is a friendship path (although you sort of have to go on a romance one to get to the friendship path) and another path that can kind of be interpreted as a romance or friendship path, depending on how the player chooses to see it. Most of the paths have a bad, normal, and happy end so there's definitely replayability value. That's one of the factors I take into account when I decide whether it's worth it to buy a new VN. There must be plenty of replayability value for me to want to go back and choose another path, make different choices, etc.  If there are any negative points in this game, I'll list a couple. First, there are a few typos that I noticed although they were mainly on one path. However, these could easily be ignored if you can get very immersed in the story. The other negative is that there is a LOT of reading at times. Madeleine will state out her thoughts in long text (in a monologue fashion) and people playing may have mixed feelings about that. I liked reading the texts and getting to learn about Madeleine's thoughts and feelings but then I can see how others might tire or not have the patience to read long walls of text.  Overall, I would highly recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of visual novels and definitely anyone who's a fan of Hanako Games. They've made great games in the past and this one is definitely a keeper. :D",

            "review_text": "I’m impressed.  As is my tradition with games, the first run I do is blind - no looking at the achievements beforehand (those sometimes give hints), no saving to take back choices, no choosing a choice to explore a scene. All the choices I make have to be the one I would find myself choosing should I be in the scenario myself, something that I found was easily done in this story - which only speaks wonders for the level of immersion I had.  This game has a lot of depth to it and was craftily done! The art and aesthetic is nice and pleasing, but most importantly fitting for the theme that the story follows: royalty and political intrigue. The soundtracks don’t transition too well from one to the other, but other than that suit the scenes beautifully and fitfully. The writing is witty and flowery in the right places, and the descriptions and reflections are apt and telling.  Regarding the game itself, it has a couple of tricky branching paths that are to be expected for something of this complexity; choosing an innocuous choice now may change a later choice (which is the base mechanic of Visual Novels that properly implement choice) by some believable reason in the story, such as a missed opportunity or causing a reaction or implying something at the right moment. The endings commonly branch into happy, normal, and bad, and from what I see are easy to obtain by saving before the pinnacle choices (showing that getting there may be the problem).   I see myself spending time to painstakingly go through all the branches and unlock the CGs and achievements and just see what exactly the novel has to offer in its entirety. While not something I would gush over and hype, I am more than willing to recommend this game and place it as one of the better constructed visual novels I’ve gone through.  Well done! ",

The art's a bit funky or unpolished in places, and there are a couple typos, but the story is solid, and every path I've tried so far has been really interesting (3/6?). If you really liked the intigue and story in LLTQ, but hated the stat system, this is going to be perfect for you. If you really liked the stat crunching and wide array of deaths, you'll be disappointed.   Oh, and this VN didn't make me feel uncomfortable like quite a few others I've tried or read reviews of did. Big + for that. Also great music.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: The game is very solid and has some very original parts but others are hopelessly cliché. The theme song is just AWESOME!  I really liked this game, the protagonist is tough and far from the typical 'sweet girl' act. That's not to say there aren't issues, however.  Pros: - Maddie is the 'protector' not the damsel. - the system of who inherits the throne and who rules is more even between the sexes, it's actually a really interesting take on the whole thing. - the bachelors are different and it's not just 'pick hot guy X' there are some twists and turns and your own happy end is not always the best result. - the characters are well-rounded and you get to become interested in them. - the happy end for a particular character is not necessarily the way you'd expected. - tons of replay value. - the intro song is SO awesome, I downloaded it!  Cons: -    being force-fed the whole 'Oscar loves you'-bit, it's cliché, annoying and frankly just seems like a big, fat 'boys and girls can never just be friends' sign beating you over the head, repeatedly.   - Maddie cannot get out of the mess she ends up in, herself, which I kinda wish was possible. However, I realize that had Maddie been a guy then it might not have been an issue, so I'm a little torn on that front. - the devs are trying WAY to hard to make some characters likable, despite being just generally awful characters who never get what's coming to them.   (The king and queen comes to mind.]    I recommend this game to VN fans who like castle settings, intrigue, princes and princesses and a heroine who can handle herself.",

I sought help in the forums, but I didn't see this problem with other people, so I can do the only thing in my power, ask for a refund and not recommend this game.
