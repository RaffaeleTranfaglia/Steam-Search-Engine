            "review_text": "ACE Academy managed to get my attention by featuring two of my favourite anime genres: High school romance, and giant robots. But what started as an impulse buy to pass the time quickly became a solid favourite of my steam library the more hours I sunk into it. For starters, the game has a solid story to it. In a Gundam Build Fighters-esque setting where the world has become obsessed with giant robots called GEARs, you are a nameless protagonist (named by you) recently transferred from America to Japan to the pilot program of titular ACE Academy following the death of your parents. It hit the right points throughout and kept me engaged through multiple playthroughs . And while it does flit more with the tropes of the high school romance side than the mecha side (Beach episode, hot springs episode, etc), there was enough science fiction here to keep it fresh. There are moments when it gets a too meta though (Less leaning on the fourth wall, more smashing it and then crushing the pieces into a fine dust), which while they made me laugh, also pulled me out of the story a bit. The characters are also a decent bunch, filling the usual tropes sure (Mayu is shy, Yuuna is kind, Kaori is Tsundere, etc), but giving each character their own strengths and flaws. I was also surprised to find the characters were all fully voiced too, and while some of the lines were strangely silent (It was still in Early Access as of writing), the cast is diverse enough that each and every character had their own unique voice, including the one-shot background ones. It was all well recorded and well-acted too, which is always a bonus. The protagonist too is just enough of a blank slate to be relatable, but still has enough of a personality (some of which is dictated by you) to make it easy to relate to. The event CGs and music are also well done, with a good variety of pieces that for the most part fit in well with their respective events. There are some problems however. While the game is still in Early Access as of writing, I’m not sure how many have been, could be, will be or can be addressed, but I would at least mention them to give my honest opinion. The biggest flaw is the mecha combat. While I wasn’t expecting Titanfall for a VN, I was sort of expecting some kind of turn based system based on the screenshots, as opposed to the quick time sequence in the build I played. While this isn’t a game breaker for me, I can’t shake the feeling that mecha combat had a larger role to play in earlier ideas. There is, for example, a loadout screen filled with empty squares that is seen exactly once, and you go through several lessons that feel important to the mecha piloting process, but ultimately just serve as world building information. While the mecha aspect is a focus of the storyline, it feels a little under loved by the end of it as a result. There are also a few odd choices for who of the secondary cast gets to be shown, and who doesn’t. The VN goes the RWBY Volume One route of having most of them silhouetted, and while that makes sense for one scene unnamed characters, there are a few, such as the professors and your sister’s friends, who appear multiple times and whose appearances aren’t revealed. On the flip side, there are characters that appear exactly once that are fully revealed, only to be never seen or heard from again. There was one character that was even shown using CG pieces instead, when having a silhouette with Yuuna giving facial reactions instead would have looked just as good, perhaps better. Speaking of CGs, while as I said before they are well done, there doesn’t feel like there’s enough of them. This might just be a personal issue of mine really, but I felt several times certain scenes needed more than just the text. This partly manifested as black screens with text describing interesting goings on, but also scenes that I’ve seen to be important in other non-eroge romance VNs (e.g. kissing) that are just described here. And while they're described well, it falls slightly flat when all you’re seeing is your girl smiling at you. A few more backgrounds might not go amiss either (An alternate library/study background, especially in Kaori’s route, was the most glaring one.) In the end though, these issues don’t really take away from the game as a whole. These are just things that I think would make a great game greater. ACE Academy is still worth the asking price. If you’re looking for a good story and strong characters to while away some hours with, this game will definitely be worth your time.",

Sure some conversations feel a bit awkward in larger groups, but overall the writing is the best I've seen for any VN.  If you're considering it, I can definitely recommend it at sale price of 10 dollars. Maybe even 20, if you're really into VN's.",

The music alone is a great aspect that really fits the theme of the game. There are various dialogue options and potential routes you can choose from, all which are unique from each other. Also, there is plenty of humor within the story that makes the expericence much more enjoyable. I would defintely get this game, especially if you want to try out new visual novels.",

            "review_text": "There is one thing i will say that could summerise Ace Academy, its like that anime that everyone likes, it has mechs, romance, a deep and dark mc history, it has everything.  This visual novel is one of the funniest things i have ever played, the choices and story are so comedic, its just too good. This is one of the choices from the game (im trying not to give much away) 'swiggity swooty im coming for that booty'. Given the situation that this choice was used in was just comedy gold or rather diamond.  PROS: - Has comedic terms but can also be serious - Quick time events that arent complete bull ♥♥♥♥ - It does a good job of getting the characters personalitys out there from the get go - Routes for all girls (kinda)  CONS: - Time jumps once, causes confusion - Ends on a blunt note (kinda) - Some bits were a bit repetative  You cant really fault it too much because it is an indie company and they did their best to strech it out and make it as interesting as possible  CONCLUSION: Must get, definatly. maybe wait for a sale but its good for the price you have to pay.  P.s: Support these guys on Patreon they are currently making a new game called Crystalline, it looks very good. If you cant find it their name is Pixelfade. ",

            "review_text": "A great step for an indie company, taking steps into the western visual novel scene. Not too long making it a good starting place for people new to the genere. Writing is primarily comedic but can be serious if it wants too. It does get a little cringy at times, but its all part of the charm. Some people say that all the character routes are the same, but this is only true in a very loose sense - with all characters following a similar emotional arc (like the route always starts happy, has a hiccup in it, then its all better in the end) but the characters are noticably differant.  The addition of timed events add a little extra spice to the game, but is nothing particualary new in amoungst VNs but it is used a fair amount in the story. This being good/bad is basiclly personal preferance.  7 or 8/10 A good breath of fresh air and I would advocate supporting it just so that western developers take visual novels more seriously.",

            "review_text": "This is a pretty decent visual novel. I think its strongest point is its humour, the characters are quite funny. The story is also interesting, I'm looking forward to what's going to happen in further episodes. Having to respond in seconds brought in some excitement, although I was hoping for just a little more interaction in the mecha fights, maybe more strategic choices, not just finding the right button.  The game's only big fault is that it feels slightly unfinished. I think showing silhouettes is even worse than not showing the minor side characters at all. (Not to mention one thing I've never understood in VN's: in public places, why are there no people in the background?) And it's an even bigger problem that there were small errors in the consequences in my choices, for example with the girls I dated the least it would immediately jump to the second or third one, and I had to figure out some information out of the context. I also had information repeated, or some information I've received would not change the behaviour of the MC. And there were a few typos. I want to be clear about that the plot flows well most of the time, but there are occasional glitches.  If the minor side characters get drawn, and the plot glitches get fixed, then I'll be very happy to replay this game.",

You WILL be laughing throughout the game.  The characters are fun and endearing (if a little stereotypical at times).  Going Overdrive makes you feel like a BA.  So why do I not recommend it?   Because the story ends half way through! I don't want to spoil anything (and mentioning anything about the main plot will spoil it), but you're in the middle of trying to solve this mystery, you're in the middle of your school year, in the middle of your budding romance and the game just stops! I was terribly disappointed.   Here's the deal, the developers obviously care and I'd hate to cost them sales. But if you need closure or a great story with an even better ending, I'd look elsewhere. Or at least see if they're going to make a sequel. As of now, this is all we got and it really isn't enough. So I don't recommend.",

            "review_text": "ACE Academy takes place in a hypothetical alternate timeline where the Allies lost World War II, leading to the terrifying future dystopia that Hitler envisioned: Every person on the planet is white and really good at everything.  Yes, exceptionalism is the norm in the ACE Academy universe. Everyone is physically, mentally, and emotionally fit. Name any hobby or activity, you and all of your friends are good at it. You might wonder how well this dynamic works when the plot ostensibly revolves around a fighting competition. Well I'll tell you. It works by keeping the stakes low and having the characters overcome any minor obstacle that appears in their way within five minutes of its introduction to the plot.  'But you can't have EVERYONE be exceptional,' you may say. 'Story quality aside, having everyone be 'exceptional' literally defeats the meaning of the word itself.' Well you see, ACE Academy is the perfect demonstration of why you are wrong. Even though all the people in this story, including your rivals, are talented and super-cool nice people, you are still the BEST at being talented and super-nice. But that's the thing. The winner is YOU. You are ALWAYS the winner, 'you' meaning 'every single person who plays this game'. You are all white guys, and you are all winners. It works. The system works.  By the way. I've heard it said that there is a basic premise behind every harem anime, and that is that the harem is always focused on a particular fetish, and all the girls within the harem are just variations of that fetish. I believe that is at least true for this game, and in this case the central fetish is 'being normal'. Of course, all the girls are exceptional at everything, but that IS normal in this universe as I already stated. Their personalities are otherwise consistently plain and reasonable. And within that central fetish of exceptional normalcy, you have your standard variations:  - Shy normal - Loud normal - Sexy normal - Normal normal - Siscon lolicon  Anyway, I hope this review has helped you determine whether you are a member of the intended demographic for this game. If you are uncertain, perhaps this will help: Statistically speaking, you probably are.",

For most players that will be about 11 hours. So maybe the game is too over pricy for most people at £19.00. But for anime fans and visual novals fans. Who like visual novels with full and enteraining dialoge and dubbed english voice acters. Then it's a must buy if you fit any of that catagory. Sadly I would wait until this game goes down in price. As £19.00 is a bit to much for a game that doesn't give you the hours to match it. But overall it's a very entertaining play and a must have for anime or visual noval fans!   10/10 Must play Ace Academy Again!",

Don't wan't to tell you the details tho so you can enjoy getting to know her on your own  Storyline - I think the game has an awesome story. (cried twice) Inside jokes - There's a LOT of them comin' Famous things that already has a name almost every 1 knows - OH god the lord of the rings xDDD  Cons :  Your character - There's 2 complains from my side. You guys can't just let me handle only 200 pounds as the strongest character choice available. You even called that a 'BEAST MODE' i was sitting here and then bursted out of laughter  That leaves only 1 thing for me to complain about..  I DIDN'T GET TO SEE THEM TITIES *curse you devs* (not really, i enjoyed your game too much to actually mean it)  Rating : 10-10 Remarkable  In the end, let me just say that i don't want you to end here.
