            "review_text": "I really wanted to like Burning Cars, and would love to be able to recommend it, but it's just not really very good.  I love top-down racers, and played rival indie racer, Blaze Rush, to completion as well, but where Blaze Rush is adrenaline-fuelled, manic fun, Burning Cars is just a bit silly, and rather frustrating.  The graphics are good, and the sounds are acceptable. The courses are not too bad either, and the variety of powerups and obstacles is reasonable, if fairly standard fare for this sort of game. But the physics are a bad joke, seeing your vehicle (of which there are really only two: a truck or a buggy) bouncing around ridiculously, hanging in the air, rebounding with seemingly more force than it hit, and being unable to turn (especially in hard mode) at any sort of speed.  Even the upgrades and weapons are disappointing, with the different models of truck only differing from each other in minor ways, and only a very limited number of different weapons available.  It's sad, because from reading the brief credits and messages, it sounds as though the indie developers of Burning Cars really put in a lot of effort over five years to bring this game to completion. It was a really nice idea, and I wish I could recommend it, but the fun and replayability is just not there. ",
