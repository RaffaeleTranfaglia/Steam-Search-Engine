            "review_text": "Edit - Dec 4 2015 - Wow this blew up, didn't expect 1000+ ratings. Thanks to everybody who rated it helpful or not and thanks to everybody for commenting. I'll respond to any comments posted here or my profile. I also changed my final score of the game in order to clear up some confusion.  Ok, now that I've got 100 hours exactly on this game, I'm going to do an updated thoughts list. This isn't a full review, just a list of observations.  Pros  - The game is really pretty. Compared to the other two 3D Fallout games, it's quite colorful.   - The FPS part of the game is greatly, greatly improved. The guns feel like they have power. The explosives actually work. Melee feels like Skyrim.   - The story is interesting. Certainly not the best, but it had a few twists and turns I didn't see coming.  - Power armor is quite cool. I think they did this really well. It's more like a vehicle that needs fuel and maintenance unlike the last games where it was just an outfit.  - Crafting. You can create many things including mods for your weapons, armor and power armor. You can also craft medicines and drugs.   - All the clutter is useful. Pick up all the junk.  - I loved the updated looks of the various wasteland creatures. Mirelurks, Super mutants, deathclaws etc.  - Common low level enemies pose a threat. Even the lowly bloatfly can have a legendary mutation and will do a lot of damage.  - Generally less buggy. I've only had a few annoying bugs. Less than I imagined for a game of this size and complexity.  - Mods. Bethesda games have always been very moddable and this one is no different.   - Armor layer system. It's pretty cool to have a base outfit, then a piece of armor for every part of the body. However, by about 60 hours playtime I'd already had gotten the best armors and haven't found an upgrade since.   Neutrals   - It runs really well...when you aren't in the city. I get a solid 60fps outside of the city but once I venture in it drops to 30 or less. I've seen a mod that might help with that but I have yet to use it. Also, zooming in with a scope drops my fps as well.  - Voice acting is surprisingly good so most characters. A few feel like they have zero personality while others genuinely feel alive.  - Exploration. There is lots to see and lots to find. You'll be wandering through lots of underground tunnels and ruined buildings. It all starts feeling same-y after a while.  - This game doesn't feel like a true successor to Fallout 3 and NV. It just doesn't have the feeling of a true Fallout game. It feels like a Fallout-themed FPS. What it does, it does well. But I think it's focused to much on the FPS and not enough on the RPG. Todd Howard said it was an RPG with FPS elements but to me it feels like the opposite, an FPS with light RPG elements.  - Removal of skills and casualization. In NV, there were plenty of times where I could use my medicine skill to fix (or kill) a person, use my repair skill to fix machinery or even use my skill level to pass a speech check. None of this is possible in F4, and none of that depth is there. The world feels much less alive.  - Voiced Protagonist. This is the big one for me. I feel as though the game was built around the protagonist having a voice. Because they needed to record so many voice lines, they sacrificed features of the game, mainly skills. If they still had skills, they'd have had to record so much more dialogue for speech checks. Voiced protagonist also limits the amount of variation the story can have, again because that would involve more recording. See where I'm going with this?  - The storyline operates similarly to Mass Effect. You can't be a truly evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like in the previous two games, but you can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ along the way. You will always be a hero.  - Settlement building. I would have put this under pros but it just lacks depth. It's neat but it brings a bunch of hassles. Your settlements need stuff to thrive. They are often being attacked or have some issue. I wanted to build an amazing base, not babysit 50 settlements.  - Removal of the karma system. Sometimes, it was good being bad. In 3 and NV, being good or bad had it's pros and cons. With this game there is no such thing and thus a layer of depth is removed from the game. The closest thing is that your companions may like or dislike certain actions.  - Removal of weapon and armor maintenance. Some people like it. I don't. It removes a layer of depth to the gameplay and makes all those guns and armor you find useless.  - Caps (money) is less useful in this game. You'll find all you need on your adventures, especially if you have the loot perks from the Luck tree. I had over a 1000 .50 sniper rounds before I ever found a .50 rifle for instance. There are a few nice items in shops but they aren't needed.  - Lockpicking is copied from Skyrim. While I'd like to have seen something new, at least I already know how to work this minigame. I've always thought that Oblivion had the best lockpicking system.  - Computer hacking is the same as 3 and NV. I never learned how to properly do it. I just guess words over and over until I get through. At least in this game, you can't be totally locked out.  Cons  - The game is a blatant console port.   - Crappy, controller designed UI. Since there are only 4 options in dialogue, this limits interactions options and removes depth.  - Story spoiler: After the end of the story, you can't lead whatever faction you sided with. They just...exist and call you the leader. They stop advancing their goals.   - After the story, you are just given repetitive settlement babysitting quests. I've stopped caring.   - Little replayability. Because of the lack of depth there aren't many roads to go down and the destinations are all the same.  - Less weapon variety than NV. By about 70 hours I had found all the base varieties of guns and had most of them modded the way I wanted. Haven't picked up a weapon since.  - Non-story quests are just go here, talk to person. Maybe shoot them. There have been a few interesting encounters but it all feels like busywork. This game is actually worse than Skyrim about this since there aren't many different ways to do it because all the depth has been removed.  - Power Armor doesn't work as expected. I expected it to absorb damage, then break. Once a piece breaks, you start taking damage to that area. However how it actually works is just another layer of armor. If you take damage, then you just take less damage, the armor doesn't absorb it all till it runs out of hp.  - But this biggest gripe I have is...  Lack.  Of.  DEPTH!!!!  Seriously, they took 70% of what makes a Fallout game Fallout and threw it away in favor of casualization (to appeal to a bigger audience and thus increase sales) and more SHOOTY ACTION. As a shooter, this game is really good. As a Fallout game, it falls flat on it's face.  My final score: 6.5/10. Fun combat, decent gear and character customization, lots of exploring and collecting. Settlement building. Lack of depth as expected from a Fallout title is the biggest flaw.",

            "review_text": "The great Adam Kovic once described Far Cry 3 as 'Skyrim with guns', unintentionally spawning a series of mock comparisons that became its own meme. Now it has come full circle, because Fallout 4 can be described as 'Far Cry 3 with nukes'. This game is no longer an RPG, it's an open-world action game with RPG elements. You don't hold exciting, well-written conversations, you shoot people in the head. You don't solve intriguing quests, you shoot everyone in the area in the head. You don't make morally ambiguous choices and join sides, you shoot everyone the game throws at you in the head. That's because shooting, slashing and blowing up hordes of interchangeable enemies is the only kind of game progression Bethesda knows. And that would be fine, if they weren't making a long-awaited sequel to one of the greatest, richest and most imaginative RPG franchises of all time. Instead of role-playing possibilities and freedom of choice that New Vegas nailed so well, we got a dumbed-down action game that limits your options at every chance. You can't really play as a bad guy, you can't toy with the SPECIAL points to create wildly different character builds and each playthrough will be more or less the same. Core RPG elements, deep mechanics and good writing were put aside and replaced by crafting and base building, which, at least from the 2/3 of DLC, seem to be Bethesda's main focus. Unfortunatelly neither the building, nor the combat mechanics are deep enough to support the game on their own, despite improving upon previous Bethesda games. It's a pity, because the beautifully designed colorful environments and great weather effects give the world a unique, eerie atmosphere unlike any game in recent memory and the improved gameplay aspects present a functional structure for a potentially great game. If only that shell was filled with worthwile content.",

            "review_text": "A lot of good points, too bad that for one improvement from the previous games, there's two or three regressions in different domains.  Yes, the game accumulates a lot of pros, and in almost every domain : the new artistic direction is awesome, the settlement construction is relatively fun, the gunplay is finally feeling right, and the wasteland is always compelling to explore.  Sadly, it ends here : in almost every other category the game fails to deliver something even equivalent to Fallout 3, which is sad given that almost a decade separates the two games :   Writing  :  Writing is the quintessential point in a good RPG, or rather  was . With a storyline that'll make a summer blockbuster sound philosophical, a cast of unidimensional characters (which includes the PC, as Bethesda did anything in their power to prevent you from appropriating it) and a crippled dialogue system, the game looks like the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of an Hollywood summer flick and a korean MMO, taking the moralizing tone and manichean storyline from the first and the endless randomly generated fetch quests from the latter.  Nothing that you do is actually important to the game world, and apparently now the Wasteland is so harsh that any NPC that is not a villain will automatically appreciate you, treat you as a hero and give you Freebie (Hello Danse that made me join him on a big operation 3 mins after meeting me, and Preston Garvey that entrusts you, the player, to liberate the wasteland all by yourself, a mere 10 minutes after a scripted action sequence (which breaks easily).  The quests are all prety bland and the same. Go there, shoot everyone, bring back the McGuffin. Again, and again. No more glimpses of Wasteland weirdness, no more infiltration, no more talking your way out of a situation, no more stealh (except in combats, to rack up a crit or two). That's right. Whatever type of character you play, you'll always heroically save the day by killing all the baddies.   Gameplay   Positive : the fast loot menu is great. Negative : everything else.  The new stats system is awful and dumbed down, and overwhelms you with a lot of choices that don't matter : 'hmmm... should I take +5% dmg resist or +5% rad resist ?' and your stats have little to no inluence on the storyline, dissociating these two elements further (no more Low-INT run where you play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ or high-charisma characters talking their way out of the most awkward situations)  Most of the mechanics that made Fallout a game about survival simply disappeared (like weapon durability, ammo types, damage thresholds, and a decent basic needs system). The only alternative is a 'Survival mode' that is more frustrating than challenging.    Graphics   The new artistic direction is great with weapons, buildings and vehicles appearing more varied, and showing more 'volume'. Everything from the guns you fire to the environment you explore feels heavy and really there, ethers from the carboardy models from Fallout 3/NV. The graphics themselves are good and the 'new' engine performs well even on lower end systems. It's because Bethesda gave up on this part and used a refurbished iD Tech as their renderer, which is a big step up from their 2001 pipeline. Even with that, everything is not perfect and you need to mess up with the config files to change even simple things like screen resolution or FoV. Not to mention the immense disappointment of 144hz monitor users that con't get the best out of their hardware. Bethesda doesn't care for both low-end and high-end hardware users.   Sounds, voices   The environmental soundtrack is great, and the choice of radio songs is still good. The addition of clasical music is a welcomed idea. However the voice acting is very inconsistent, and the crappy dialogue system doestn't help making things credible. That's a lot of burnt money that could've went to other departments (like Q&amp;A, programming, or maybe to hire professional writers instead of the poor lonely intern).  Overall the game disappoints, even though it has a lot of good elements. If you look for a good FPS go ahead, but you're warned, the game istn't anything more. Till the moddig scene develops that is.

            "review_text": "Well, Fallout 4 and all it's DLC has finally been released.   I have so many mixed feelings about Fallout 4. Most of them negative.  First, let's talk base game problems. - The writing is terrible. No suprise as the lead writer from Fallout 3 (Also terrible writing) wrote for the base game. Compared to Fallout NV, Fallout 4 feels like a childrens book.  - Settlement/Workshop mode. Oh boy, this mode will drive you crazy. You might think this mode is pretty interesting at first, but let me tell ya...you're in for a whole lot of disappointment! All I have to say is this; You WILL hate Preston Garvey (Who is a prime example of terrible writing btw). - Fallout 4 is NOT an RPG. There is no meaningful choices in this game. You might think there are, but it all concludes the same. It doesn't matter what side you pick, what dialogue you say. You get the same ending all the time. You want meaningful choice? Ha, go play Witcher 3. - The main quest is terrible. It's predictable, cliche, and boring. You know what's gonna happen before it does. The 'twist' is worse than an M. Night Shyamalan twist, and just leaves you wanting to go back to the Mojave.  - It's buggy. Because Bethesda. People used to forgive Bethesda for releasing buggy and broken games, well...not this time.  - It's performance on PC is terrible. You can have a GTX 1080, i7 6700k and the game will run like crap. Why? Because Bethesda is still using the 'Creation' Engine based on Gamebryo which tends to have poor performances...and bugs. Stuttering, freezing, crashing, frame drops, you name it. Fallout 4 probably has it. - I'm sure there is way more, but I'm getting tired of typing. Let's just say this; I knew from the second I didn't hear Ron Pearlman voicing the intro this game was gonna have problems. He's the news anchor though  because...why?  WHY!? YOU COULDN'T EVEN MAKE A PROPER FALLOUT 4 INTRO BETHESDA?   Okay, I said I had mixed feelings remember? There is *some* good in the game. - For starters, the companions are actually interesting. Even if their dialogue is terrible, they have personality and are quite mememorable. Like Piper, and Curie! Except Preston Garvey. You'll hate Preston Garvey. - Combat mechanices are refined. Shooting feels smoother and more responsive and...like an actual shooter. That can be a good or bad thing depending what you're looking for. I personally dig the refind combat. - You can have a great experience in 3rd person. I usually play Bethesda games in 1st person because 3rd person was typically poorly implemented (only usful for checking out how cool your character looks). But in Fallout 4, Bethesda finally nailed 3rd person gameplay. It feels responsive, and smooth. The animations are acceptable and there is manual FOV options. I played the entire game in 3rd person for my first playthrough. Quite nice. - Music is fantastic. I have to admit I wasn't keen on the OST at first, but after a while, the music grew on me and is my favorite Fallout soundtrack. Tracks can be peaceful and beautiful to epic and adventurous. Good stuff. - The Commonwealth is beautiful. Graphically? No. But artistically? Yes. Bethesda still knows how to do one thing right, and that's craft fantastic worlds to explore! - and that's all I can think of.   The negatives outweigh the postives for me. Especially when you get into the Season Pass and it's content.   Compared to Fallout 3's FIVE expansions, and Fallout New Vegas's FOUR expanions, Fallout 4 only has TWO 'expansions'. TWO! I REPEAT, TWO! The rest of the content is Workshop/settlement content. And yes, I'm counting Automatron as workshop content. It's a workshop with a side quest attatched to it. You get less content than previous titles, and worst of all the price for them is...well, overpriced. The Season Pass USED to be $30 USD but Bethesda PROMISED $60 worth of content and hiked the price up to $50. Now this is highly subjective but I don't feel the Season Pass and it's DLC lived up to that claim.   Far Harbor - $24.99 has a short main quest, and a few interesting side quests. You apparently get the 'largest' DLC world Bethesda has crafted but it feels sparse and empty. I'd say it's worth $9.99 USD.  Nuka-World (A.K.A. the worst expansion from Bethesda) - $19.99 has a short side quest, and a world that feels larger than Far Harbor but even MORE empty. It feels like a world created for a mod, and they haven't finished it yet. I'd say $9.99 but that's being a bit forgiving.   Look, I went on long enough. Point is, for me, Fallout 4 is a terrible Fallout game and a terrible Bethesda game. I know they can do better. They know they can do better. They dumbed down their own formula to appeal to a wider audience but ended up hurting their core audience in the process.   If you're a Fallout fan, you already own the game. But if you're looking to get into Fallout, start with New Vegas. It's well written, has a ton of content, and the modding scene is amazing.  I'd only recommend Fallout 4 for modding.",

            "review_text": "WARNING: This is more of a rant than a review.  Bethesda is going on a downard spiral from RPG greatness to more casual gameplay, For the love of God they need to know just how important it is they stop watering down their games before they do any more damage.  I started this game with high hopes and was instantly crushed when I discovered there was no karma or really any choice in the game outside of who your allies are which is total bull****. You can be a good guy, a sarcastic good guy, or an ***hole goodguy. At least in Skyrim you had the Dark Brotherhood to let you feel like a bad guy if you so chose (even then though the guilds in Skyrim pale in comparison to past titles).   Not to compare the Fallout series to Elder Scrolls but it just goes to show how much their two franchises have been declining in quality over the years. As I played the game more I began recognizing many flaws in the engine itself as well which made it apparent that this engine was adapted from Skyrim's.  I spent a lot of time modding Skyrim so there are many little things I won't take much time discussing that bug me such as when you unequip a weapon it disappears into some alternate reality never to be seen again until you re-equip it. Honestly how hard would it be to fix this? Even swords aren't sheathed in some way or floating at your side. Skyrim, Fallout 3, Oblivion, all managed to pull this off so there really isn't any excuse.   The game is fun but it didn't feel like I was immersed in a world that would be my playground to do with as I wish, but rather a linear game where I'd blast things to continue on my preditermined path. That isn't what I remember feeling when I first played fallout 3. Building settlements is a nice feature but it is limited and eventually I just focused on one settlement due to lack of interest.  I haven't really played Fallout 4 since I beat it, if there were any impacting choices to be made I might have an incentive to make another playthrough. And I have not used any mods outside of postprocessing since I don't like the idea of corrupting my saves, a date for official tools would be nice.   I am pretty old school so the graphics don't bother me, but it is kind of funny to think back when Bethesda games were always on the cutting edge of visual quality. It seems that the graphics suffer because it has been in development for so long, correct me if I am wrong. Too bad there isn't much to show for it from all that time.   CD Projekt Red made substantially less money from Witcher 2 than Bethesda made from Skyrim and yet they developed a fantastic new engine that demonstrates quality and quantity. Also when people say 'just wait for mods' to fix all your problems I think that says a lot about the developers.  So please Bethesda, listen to your fans and try to improve in the future. Otherwise you might lose your grip from your past innovations as a major player in the gaming industry.",

Fallout 4 is unlike the other games in alot of ways, gameplay, developement and story. Fallout 4 takes a different approach to the apocalypse. Instead of focusing on RPG elements like the previous fallout games, it focused on bringing in more of the FPS aspects. From sprinting to hitmarkers, they practically copy and pasted everything from the FPS genre into the fallout universe, and lets just say it just does not mix. Fallout 4 had a stale, repetative gameplay, go here, clear out raiders, go here, kill synths kill synths kill synths, thats all you do in this game. You also cant be evil in this game, literally, the worst you can be in this game is a sarcastic jerk who occasionally kills a grandma or two. The sidequests have no interesting story nor are they fun to do at all. I was also dissappointed with the developement of this game, they took 8 years to work on this game, and it lacked so much! Fallout 4 has a map to a similar size to fallout 3, maybe a bit bigger, but with sprinting added to the game, you can easily get across the map in about 15 minutes. --SPOILERS PASSED HERE--  Fallout 4 also severely lacks a good storyline. You wake up in a apocalyptic setting, knowing your wife (or in my case husband) has been killed and your son taken, you havent had any bond with these two characters as you know nothing more then the 3 minute intro, so to be honest the entire time going through the story I didnt give a crap about what happened to him. The first half of the game you kill raiders, and all they have are pipe pistols, then you go up to synths, which are pretty much bullet sponges to make the short amount of areas take longer to complete. The story is the most linear of any of the fallouts other then 1 and 2. You have 4 factions to choose from, but they all have the same exact missions, so its pretty much just one story, reskinned 4 times. We all called the ending from a mile away anyways. Story is the best part of the fallout franchise, and to see them butcher it like this really sucks..    All in all, fallout has been one of my favorite franchises, and holds a special place in my heart, but this was one of my least favorite. I had very high hopes for this game, but it constantly fell short of expectations. With linear, repetative combat, a cliche story and a 8 year wait period to come out. I couldnt help but expect more from my favorite developers.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr Fallout 4 is a huge leap backwards from Skyrim in every regard. Its not a bad game per se, but keep your money until next year's christmas. The modders will have to work double shifts to finish this console port.  With the exception of the first ten minutes and what you saw in the trailers, this review is spoiler free.   The Pro's: --------------- * there's a lot of Fallout in here * modding support should be decent since its based on the Skyrim engine * the combat feels fluid enough for a RPG * ironsights for most guns * VATS now slows down time instead of pausing the game (I like it) * so far no gamestopping bugs except for constant crashes when I exit the game * borderless fullscreen mode * Apple/Android app is a nice touch for people who like to have the map open at all times, it works for me * animated hair (PhysX?) * not a single CTD so far * Achievements not working (one of the stupidest reward methods ever conceived), Steam Overlay not working either so probably connected (Edit: Achievements suddenly started working, possibly because I started Steam in Admin Mode or they fixed something, Overlay still not working)  * Dogmeat is kinda useful now, he pins down opponents, occasionally finds loot piles and won't die five minutes after you found him (like he did in Fallout 3) * Dogmeat goes into 'sneak mode' when you do, looks very cute * Dogmeat generally behaves like a 'real' dog, he runs away from you to sniff at things, runs ahead or stays back for a bit ... he's no DD yet, but close  * conversations are much more natural than in previous Bethesda games (more than 2 actors involved, actions happening, etc,), but they're bugged to hell, more on that below * you can move the camera arround freely during conversations and even run arround, the talker will continue to talk and wait until you focus him again to present your four response options, no more being tidally locked to a single NPC  * interesting armor system (you can strap armor on top of your armor, like shoulderpads) * you can use the Minigun from the Power Armor without actually using the Power Armor (weird, but its Fallout) * Ghouls have become semi-zombies, some are laying arround like a corpse until they notice you or continue to crawl when their legs are gone, try to jump &amp; bite you without arms * talkative enemies taunt you during combat while you fight your way to them, making the shooter part a bit more organic * tinkering with your Power Armor feels like working on your own car  * I was sceptical about the voiced protagonist, but the female does a decent job, it will make modding quite a bit harder though * If you play the standard female player character (the one shown in the trailers), Piper looks almost exactly like you. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but for RP-reasons I will pretend that she is my grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-niece.   The Con's: --------------- * boring but also rushed prologue/tutorial in the most ugly environment imaginable * yes, even more boring than the doctor's questions in F:NV * the main plot quickly becomes completly redundant * the forced straight marriage spouse and the baby fail to create any emotional attachment to either of them (How could they in the rushed 5 minute prologue?) * getting the iconic Power Armor ten minutes into the game is an odd design choice * no food/water required, a step back from F:NV * 'Survival' difficulty has nothing in common with survival games, not even F:NV * Stimpacks heal limbs again, and you don't even have to target the broken one, just pop a Stimpack into your arm to grow a new foot * not having to train skills to improve in them feels wrong  * the village building is vastly oversimplified (I demolished 3 buildings in 10 seconds, imagine woodchopping in Skyrim without ever swinging your axe) and feels like its been rushed on top of the game for feature creep * the village building quickly becomes a chore thanks to the ridiculous UI * still the same outworldy 'hacking' of computer terminals (guess 4 times, then get locked out, although this time you can retry after 10sec), reminds me of Sudoku  * C-movie quality conversations, at least during the first hours, it gets better the moment you meet Piper but they continue to feel forced and out of place * Bethesda took the easy way out of the problem with followers stabbing you in the back, get a perk that disables friendly fire damage, no need to teach Piper *not* to use that Fat Man next to you * after spending a few hours with my protagonist, its beginning to feel like she has a split personality, mine (during normal play) and hers (during conversations), extremly limited conversation options are not helping here either  * holstered weapons disappear from existance * enemies fall out of the sky, Dragon Age 2-style * enemies regulary get stuck, jitter arround, generally bug out * legendary enemies are pretty meh ('Legendary Bloatfly' ... uh-huh) * cars still got built-in nukes that go off if you look at them funny (it's okay if you like it, I don't)  * extreme loading times even for small buildings, SSDs are a huge help, but still * tons of loading screens in general, an engine out of its time * ugly, washed out graphics, it could be my imagination but I remember Fallout 3 to be prettier and less cartoon'y for its time * FPS rollercoaster, even though my Skyrim runs at constant 60 FPS with 2K textures * don't even try to compare Fallout 4's landscape to Skyrim, it will make you weep (not talking green meadows, just detail and atmosphere) * wax museum character models  * gigantic, oversized console UI (as usual) * literally the most unintuitive UI controls for a PC game of all times, Bethesda tried really really hard to pi** off PC players this time, this goes especially to the Pip-boy handling * EVE Online character creator with bonkers Gamepad-turned-into-Keyboard controls * dialogs only offer four responses with one trying to be extra-witty, like those dumbed down Bioware RPGs * talent tree looks pretty and funny, but also unnessecarily bloated (pro tip: you can scroll down!) * most weapons take up a quarter of the screen, I'm not even talking about rocket launchers, just pistols  * loot menu pops up everywhere and ruins immersion, no more opening boxes to see what's inside, especially distracting in combat * talking to sleeping people sometimes makes them stand up immediatly, instead of waking and getting up * NPCs happily block your way in the best of Bethesda's tradition * NPC AI seems to be from the 90's, melee's happily run into minigun fire with a pocket knife, grenades are generally thrown at walls in front of them (incinerating themselves instead of me), animals blindly charge avoid of all fear, etc. pp.   Edit: Figured out the console keys on the german keyboard. Its AltGr+Ö.   About the missing ACHIEVEMENTS, you may want to google it before falling back to kindergarten insults. My Steam Overlay is not working either and its a known problem. One of many.   About the marriage paragraph, let me quote one comment: 'Kaiser Fred VIII The fact that you are forced to have a wife isn't a problem of social justice or whatever, the problem is that it forces a backstory on your character. It isn't yours anymore. You can't be a socially recluse engineer living alone, or some widowed businessman or whatever. You *have* to be a married vet with a son. It is not *your* character, it is Bethesda's character. That, combined with a voiced protag, pretty much killed any prospect of replayability and RP in this game to me before I even got my hands on it.'    I think I will stop playing Fallout 4 soon and wait for the modders to eventually fix this console port. Thanks for all the comments, especially the kindergarten-level haters. You guys have inoculated me against anything the internet can throw at me for the next 100 years! :)",

This is evidently a unique and not a lazy form of writing stand point at all. If you don't care about fallout and what it did stand for and love bethesda's poor writing, buggy unfinished gameplay, and dumbing down and just want to point a gun and shoot bland and most of the time not even developed characters than this will probably work for you.

Bethesda spread themselves too thin adding new features and mechanics rather than making diverse quests that aren't just the same linear 'kill everything'.  :(  Edit:  For people calling me out in the comments for apparently comparing Fallout 4 to the Witcher, I'm not. It wouldn't be fair, Witcher is a story driven rpg, Fallout is a (supposedly) open ended explore-the-world type rpg.  My short review is based on my experience of Fallout 4 and that of previous installments. Fallout 4 is a much more linear kill-everything game than previous games, try and prove me otherwise.   It lacks the diverse quests and locales of previous games. Sure Bethesda haven't been the best at writing, and yes I am going to compare this to the Witcher now because it's constructive criticism. CD Projekt Red know how to pace a plot and write interesting quests and characters, Fallout 4 doesn't get a bye-ball just because it's Bethesda. It's plot was a joke and very poorly paced, I never felt a connection to my son in it - compared to Fallout: New Vegas, where the plot is about revenge, I felt more personally involved in it. Even in Fallout 3 your Dad is at least characterised and you get pulled into project purity because it's his (and your mother's) dream project and is good for the wasteland.   Now to compare it to Witcher 3, since a load of you think I did in my original post. Witcher 3 introduces Ciri and Yennefer and immediately characterises them, even for people who haven't read the books the games are based on. Throughout the game you see flashbacks of Ciri, building her character and that of the game's overall plot. In Fallout 4 you get a child, whom you have no real connection to other than being told he's your son. Hell, most of the quests in the Witcher also end up in fights - but the difference is they aren't just Faceless 'Raiders' each enemy is characterised; bandits, deserters, soldiers, witch hunters, Wild Hunt Warriors etc.   Anyway, what's the problem with comparing one game to another if it's constructive? You can all see I have 100+ hours in Fallout 4, this is an honest full review of what I played, and I was disappointed - just because I prefer Witcher 3 over it doesn't mean I'm not entitled to an opinion on it. Different strokes for different folks I guess.",

            "review_text": "Fallout 4 is in no way a good bethesda game. I have played this game for about 180 hours so far and have been disappointed beyond belief that people can accept this game into the fallout franchise.   The simplistic nature of the dialogue system is very saddening for two reasons. The first being is you don't know what your character is going to say, The game giving you the option of things like 'Impressed' or 'sarcasm' is very frustrating because you don't know what they are going to say or the tone. The second part about the dialogue system is that it gives you the usual options of a good response, mean, helpful and even with these basic responses don't really change how they respond or change the situation at hand where in other fallout games you could your choices of speech actually changed the situations and the smallest choices could change the game where fallout 4 fails to do so.   The voiced protagonist is stupid. I hope there's a dlc where your mouth gets shot and the player can actually choose between more than 4 options. I don't need someone else to feel the emotion for me when I respond, I don't need it vocalized.   Fallout 4 also lacks content. I can't remember a time in new vegas or skyrim where I did not have a quest at hand. Fallout 4 at this point I only have repeatable side quests. and at only 180 hrs in. But i know what your thinking. 'isnt 180 hours worth of content good though?' not for this game. The amount of time I have actually liked playing this game is minimal. About a third of my time I have been building settlements. Settlements are like chores. There not fun for you because they are too small to make something you find cool, and it just takes a while to get enough stuff to make your settlers happy, by the way settlers are useless they provide nothing but decoration and people to work your shops that don't give a good return rate. About 20% of the game is spent on item management. and the final part is the actual game. In skyrim and fallout nv I remember finding great places exploring finding cool quests here and there. This game has little of that. The map is so cramped I could go from one end to another in little time, and many places copy and pasted the same enimies: Raiders, SuperMutants, Gunners, Synths. Just those four things over and over and over It would have been nice to add a few more towns and enemy factions just so it has variety, but it just seems all the same. When you complete the game for the first time you see ending cinematic and kind of think it cheesy and stupid, But when you finish it with another group it's basicly the same, There's almost no difference with the endings, and there's so little endings. The quests are quite boring and predictable. Fallout 4 does not feel like an rpg, I don't fully understand why the rpg tag is set to this game.   Settlements are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic. As I said before they are like chores. You get everything good for your settlers than yourself, You need to always look out for stuff just so you have enough to make another turret or food, or beds. And there is no reward they give you almost nothing the best use for them is shops. which don't give a good return rate. The settlements don't give you good quests there are no cool characters that you can have a conversation with most people are just the same. The settlements are lacking a lot, there's no reason to go back to them unless they are being raided, and the settlements just feel like an unfinished mechanic.  The building of the settlments are buggy as ♥♥♥♥. When it tries to snap to other objects you often have to take more time then it should configuring where to place your mouse how much rotation it should have even if its as simple as a floor. The furniture and decoration variety is not much. You can end up being alright with what you get, But more to choose from would have been cool. And when it comes to farms, Seal them off, your turrets and settlers will just shoot through the crops and just makes the extra task of repairing the crops.  The load screens are long enough that you can ♥♥♥♥ing die of old age, and the bugs are enough that you have to reset your computer every 2 hours.   Overall I would say I had about 30 hours of enjoyment with this game the other 150 hours were hoping it would turn into a fallout game.  UI is optomized for Controllers, I dont blame bethesda on this one they were probably paid to make it that way.  I think im just going to forget about this game and pretend it did not happen because it was just a setback in bethesda development.",

            "review_text": "Edit (Original Review found after the jump):   This article  [sinisterdesign.net]  makes several smart points about the definition of 'RPG' as we use it now.  It concludes that an RPG is a game that features 'player-driven development of a persistent character or characters via the making of consequential choices.'  I know people gripe about not being able to make 'meaningful choices' in Fallout 4 (in comparison to previous Fallout games, or other CRPG's), and in a lot of ways I agree. But the reviews I was responding to don't say 'Fallout 4 is not a CRPG', they say 'Fallout 4 is not an RPG!!! It's an FPS!!!'.  The game limits the kind of choices you can make in order to streamline the experience and focus on a bigger market. They didn't remove choice completely, as what you choose to do still absolutely affects both subplots and the main storyline, but they did limit it pretty significantly.  I want to re-state that  just because it doesn't have as much choice as previous Fallout games it doesn't mean it doesn't have choice at all . There is a difference between not being able to do as much of something and not being able to do that thing at all.  The 'RPG' world isn't cut and dry. And for people making the distinction that 'jrpg's are different!!!' : No. They're not. They are still RPG's. It's just a sub-genre of a much broader category. Just like Action-RPG's, which is honestly what I would consider Fallout 4. But as such, it is still  fully  an RPG.   It's just not as much of a CRPG as it once was. But it is most certainly not an FPS (the shooting mechanics are way sub-par in comparison to the current FPS market), and it is definitely not an Action / Adventure title.  Definitions change with time. Gaming, and gaming categorizations, are not a science. I understand people are upset that the game doesn't fit their expectation of what they thought it would be. There are things I miss from previous Fallout games, too. Did that curve my enjoyment? Maybe a little. Not enough to dismiss the game as a failure, or to label it a 'non-RPG'. It just means I needed to adjust my expectations. Expectations set by the audience, not the developer. We were told we'd be delivered an expansive RPG with better graphics, better fighting mechanics, an overhauled weapons modding system, new building mechanics, and a streamlined narrative interface. That's what we got.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The people who are complaining that this 'isn't an RPG' because your character comes with a backstory are forgetting the Final Fantasy games, the Kingdom Hearts series, every Zelda game ever.. are those not RPG's then? Because there are few 'choices' to make in those games, and all of the characters we play have set backstories. But it's still an RPG. 'RPG' doesn't mean you literally get to role play every part of your character.   Yes, I understand that that's what we're used to from Fallout. But, to be honest, Bethesda's Fallout games have never been 'true' Fallout games to begin with. They began by essentially scrapping the feel of the Fallout games that came before, and are simply evolving their take on the world once more.  To say that this game 'isn't worth it' simply because it isn't the same game we've gotten twice before is ironic. It isn't an FPS. Not by a long shot. A game having passable shooting mechanics does not make it an FPS. It is fully an RPG, but with a stronger focus on story than we've gotten before.  Does this mean you don't get to still explore the world? No. There is still tons to do in Fallout 4. And just because your 'choices' don't affect the main storyline as much as in other games, doesn't mean the subplots aren't heavily affected by who you choose to be, what you choose to say, and who you choose to align yourself with.   Fallout 4 is a different game than Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas were. Just like those titles were completely different from Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. That doesn't mean that they weren't Fallout games. And it doesn't mean that this isn't a Fallout game, too.",

            "review_text": "I want to like this game. I  really  want to like this game. But it's not a Fallout game. This game takes what made Fallout a unique and great as a game and completely flushes it down the toilet. There is little strategy in this game, skills are gone and with it the careful planning of making specialized character builds. There is no level cap, you can get all the perks in the game with one character, and you can get 10 points into each SPECIAL stat. Bethesda has choosen not to go along with the damage threshold system featured in New Vegas and has gone back to the arguably inferior damage resistance system, meaning that a gun that shoots ten thousand bb pellets a minute will do more damage against an enemy wearing power armor than a high calliber rifle, so there is generally no reason to go with anything but the weapon with the highest damage per second. Weapons and armor no longer need to be repaired (with the exception of power armor), meaning that having multiples of the same weapon or armor in your inventory is uneeded weight for the most part, once you have a weapon or armor you will never need another of the same kind. The new dialog system is uttterly terrible, you can only guess what your character will say from a few words for each option (which you only get 4 of), so quick saving during dialog is advisable as it isn't uncommon for you to expect your character to say one thing and then totally say the opposite.  The pc version of this game feels as though it has been very neglected, as if it were some retaliation to the paid mods fiasco for Skyrim. The promise of an uncapped frame rate seems to have been a flat out lie, as the game's actual speed is directly tied to it's framerate, and attempts to uncap the frame rate in the config files makes the game unstable. This is absolutely unacceptable for a AAA game in 2015. The game also still runs on the same engine bethesda has used since Oblivion (but of course a very updated version), and it shows. Despite this, the game is extremely demanding for it's lack of decent graphics, and I personally have had trouble maintaining over 60 fps with an overclocked GTX 970 and an intel i7-4790k with decent settings, and there doesn't appear to be much of a difference in fps between low and high graphics settings. Menus such as the pip boy are a pain to navigate with a mouse, even worse than they were in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Mouse sensitivity is a big issue, verticle sensitivity is half of the horizontal sensitivity, which makes little sense being that this game seems to be more of an fps than an rpg. There are lots of tall buildings and you will often be shot at from great heights, making it annoying to aim with the lower sensitivity. Mouse acceleration and mouse lag caused by the needed v sync for stability make aiming even more frustrating, and aiming down the sights with a weapon makes the mouse sensitivity slow to a crawl. Raising your mouse sensitivity (which must be done out side of the game because it lacks such simple options) will make aiming easier, but you will find your mouse flying across the screen when you use it in menus. Vats mode no longer pauses the action, which may seem a purely good change, but selecting parts of the body to target becomes more difficult than you would think when the target is moving.  There are pros to this game, but seeing how the majority of reviews of this game are positive, I'm sure you can read about them there. There are also a lot more cons to this game, but the ones listed here are the ones that I was most disapointed about. If it's enough for you that this game has the name 'Fallout' then you will probably enjoy this game. If not, you will probably be disapointed.",

I'm not going to complain about graphics or glitches because I myself am not a graphic freak and have yet to encounter glitches. The game runs well and I'm suprised because my setup didn't fully fit what the minimum was.  But here are my reasons as to why I do not like Fallout 4 -It feels like it was rushed -Terrible and boring dialouge -Power Armor and Minigun at level 2 -Story that didn't catch me but I had to follow because there were only 2 NPC's in my area (Codsworth and Dogmeat) -Bland story so far. Just go kill this, help this, kill this, look for him. -The beginning made it look promising but then they freeze you. No story in the vault other than (Not spoiling) but you know what happened -The map is incredibly small and its a 20 min run across but in games prior it took much longer even with no clip at max agility -The crafting is confusing and not very interesting -They re made a world that was over. The new designs of weapons make no sense unless they were only in Boston -The game was meant for a controller -No mouse settings. Mouse speed up is ridiculous and the Mouse sensitivity is a joke -NPC's are very jittery and like to speed up and around. They never want to engage from the front -They turned the ghouls into zombies. Just really fast buggy zombies. -This games only true hope with me is for good DLC but that might not even make me change my mind.  I will say this. Its not a bad game at all. I do enjoy it a little bit but its not a Fallout game like we enjoyed before. Its a game with Fallout strapped onto it, using only the most basic things from it. Fallout 4's rating from me 6/10 Game rating if it didn't get the hype it didn't deserve. 8/10",

But unfortunately Fallout 4 threw away the whole repair skill, speech is worthless now and barely exists, all the ammo types in new vegas were thrown out the window. If you like the shooter aspect it is a fun game but it has lost what made Fallout so great. It was a huge let down including a almost reversed story line of Fallout 3 and the dlc Far Harbor is different but essentially a Point Lookout. Don't get me wrong it's technically a Fallout but it threw away so much that made it so good. Unfortunately i have to say this is a HUGE let down and so far the game as a whole is not better than a single Fallout 3 or Fallout NewVegas dlc (except ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Dead Money).",

But these are not what defined Fallout.   I remember the day I got GFWL's version of FO3. In 2009 I was using a HD 3470 laptop, The graphic sucks, I can only get 20-30fps in Windowed mode with low-mid settings, and I only use V.A.T.S because the shooting part feels awful and inaccurate. But I still say it’s the best game in its genes. The plot went with your choices, nice little details in interaction, Karma and skill system, food / water and sleep actually means something.   But most importantly, it’s DIALOGUE, PLOT and EMOTION defined Fallout, they made you feel what’s like to be in a post-war wasteland, where characters have emotions and your choices can decide their life and death, and you realize that every life matters, or you can let the devil out and have no mercy, in a world where everyone for himself.  I remember that after the first 30 minutes I found Metagon instead of the Mighty Power Armor I still remember Tenpenny Tower, they let ghouls in - I persuaded them, when I returned, no one lives, ghouls rules I remember that girl named Cherry, I put 1000 caps into her pocket in stealth mode, hoping she may choose a better life, found her died outside Rivet City, guess old habits die hard Remember Dead Money in FONV, God and Dog and Lonesome Road, one of the best plots I've seen in RPG games   But FO4, Yes, No, Maybe, Sarcastic? Pre-defined character and plot, shallow, meaningless quests and dialogues, NPCs are just cold plastic models like those in the museum. Most times they don't have a life. They don't concern life and death.   No more surprise moments when you access a terminal and find a novel-like story – Mostly they only have obvious clues for items. Also, the moments when you find something rare when looting.   No more Karma system.   Maybe they should remove all the dialogue, perk and other RPG elements, just focus on the shooting part, they could even get rid of the 'annoying' health bar and stimpak, mix it with the new crafting system, turn it into a great Wasteland FPS game! 'Call of Falloutcraft' ! Maybe it'll be better, since in that case I won't wait for this game for years and finally waste my money.  Guess I don't need to describe those good old days. From Battlefield Hardline to Call of Duty BO3, Assassin's Creed Unity, then Arkham Knight, you already knew those days are long gone.  End of an Era.

            "review_text": "I'm sorry, Bethesda. Not this time. I can't give you the thumbs up.  For those of you who are interested in a game with a simpified skill tree, little character customization and a mass-effect styled walk around the globe and do cool stuff game then this is definitely the game for you. It runs smooth enough and with mods can provide some very nice customization, though in its current state isn't very good for what it tries to achieve.  The system -   Fallout 4 uses a tech tree style similar to Wolfenstein New Order (EDIT: I was wrong about Bethesda's involvement. It was my assumption from the loading screen of Wolfenstein that Bethesda was involved more heavily. I should have done more research, my bad. Understand as a lifelong fan of Fallout, from the very first DND-type games to New Vegas, I loved this series. To see it die infront of me had me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ing like a king.) in which you spend your points on perks and unlocks rather than leveling up skills. There are no skills in the game as far as I can tell, you level up lockpicking 4 times and you get master/unbreakable (Which is only available at lvl 40 anyway, good luck with that.). You level up your science you can modify energy guns, but not make them. There's only a few energy/plasma weapons in the game anyway because they're all customizable but in a very small range of play.   Armor crafting is even worse. They use a modular system, IE you can put on specific limbs, but it doesn't work with all clothing so if you want to wear a labcoat and a raider arm you can't. Have to use a harness or one of the modular pieces. So modular but not modular armor. You can upgrade your clothes and armor as well, unless it's anything but the vault suit, which can be given a lining upgrade much like the guns can get damage upgrades but you can't do this on labcoats or other items which usually count as clothes. Suppose that much is fair but for a game that prides item customization, it's lacking.  As far as buildings/settlements goes it's mediocre. Looks like a mod still in alpha. There's limited options, half the pieces in settlements don't have snap points and basically ARK did it better.  Dialogues are by far the most abysmal thing I've ever seen. If I wanted to play mass effect I'd go to Origin. Four options, your character talks. Now this might not be a big deal for some of you players but for people who enjoy a roleplaying game it's pretty unimmersive. The story is too complex for you to make your own adventure, the character you play has a preset route he has to go through and you merely choose the way he goes about it. In that sense it's sort of semi-linear but for me a deal breaker of the highest kind. In skyrim your options were very diverse, you could say and do a multitude of crazy things and due to the way the story was set up, you could imagine your character to be of any background and any way. Here, your dude ♥♥♥♥♥es every 7 seconds about his military life and dead wife. It's not your character, it's bethesda's original OC do not steel. Sure you can melt his face but if you have no idea how to sculpt then you'll likely fail, and with no numbers or sliders you can't do specific tweaks.  Moving onto that, the face sculpter is an interesting idea but it's difficult to master. It's somewhat intuitive, has a few options and the triangular body slider isn't that bad of an addition but without the numbers you're at a disadvantage if you want something specific. It's more of a personal preference, but for those who enjoy making characters with defined features, saving presets and other such race-menu esque details, it's nigh impossible. A sidenote: Bethesda likes to limit your options by making you find comic books in the world to unlock hair styles and tattoos/scars for future playthroughs. While it's a good idea in theory, it ends up leaving you with only 20 hairstyles to start, though it's really not a big deal due to the barber only costing 15 caps.  Despite everything I know and love being ripped from the corpse of the game and simplified to a point where nothing matters, there are some significant improvements. For instance, your companions can dislike and like actions. If you steal infront of Codsworth, he gets salty about it and will even sometimes reprimand you for your choices. The charisma options are interesting as well, you don't have a flat fail rate you have a dice instead. If you convince someone, the difficulty of convincing them is shown in a gradiant of yellow to orange in the text of the ONE OF FOUR OPTIONS AAAA--  Sorry. It's just very disappointing. I suppose my summary for this game, and I might add on more to this review later, is go play Mass Effect, atleast the PC version wasn't a console port.  Edit: The thing that makes this game the worst, is it is SO different from past versions and the successful godsend Obsidian made that there's going to be too much work for modders to do. They're going to have to tear this FPS apart at the core to make it like it was. We were promised a roleplaying game, something where we can design our own characters and have broader choices. What we got was a 3 dimensional railroad.",

Modding weapons and building structures isn't enough to make this game feel fresh and feel like it was worth the wait. The game is missing a connection between the player and the environment, i can't explain it but something just doesn't work. Fallout 4 just feels like a new skin on an old body. The combat feels dated, the story is forced and feels rushed. Fallout 3 was going to be hard to equal and this game doesn't come close to matching the atmosphere, excitment and wonder. Fallout 4 is by no menas a bad game, it just hasn't added anything to take the genre into a new era. There was an opportunity missed here.  Admendment -  After sinking a few more hours into the game, my mind hasn't changed at all. I would put Fallout 3 in the top 10 games of all time and Fallout 4 in the top 100. There are only a few new enemy types, which is lazy design, the AI has improved which is a plus. The game feels like it is still using the Fallout 3 code, it doesn't feel like a huge improvement. The few vaults i have come across don't have the same atmosphere of fear of excitment, they are very bland and polished.  Companions keep getting in the way, either in combat or they block doorways. I haven't bothered to build any structures, some people will love that side of the game and sink hours into it, but they missed a major part of game development here. They could have made a mini area control game, with numerous factions pushing for major controll. The controlling of areas would be a constant push and pull. You could get one settlement to produce water, food etc, which you could access or even sell. The structure building part of the game feels unfinished in its current incarnation.  The weapon modding is a nice bit of fluff, but the fact you have to sink skill points into specific areas just to mod a baseball bat or a gun doesn't return on the amount of time you have to sink into the whole process (the collecting of specific items and skills)  On the plus side, the load times are very good, quite a few bugs, dog meat gets stuck in walls, as do enemys, and the game crashes every so often when i access the map on the pip boy.",

As for the game, Most of the issues have been brought up, like the Protags voice, to missed oppurtunities with story line. My biggest problem is the leveling, Why would someone think that you have to be at level 10 to become an armorer is beyond me. Or that you have to have a science skill of 10 with agility 10 and Endurance oh wait plus Perception to be able to build a wooden wall. This is truely where they messed up.  So a game that is using a fairly stable engine with thousands of hours spent using it (Skyrim) why do we still have clipping issues, frame rate locks, FOV locks, etc... The first hour playing sent me to Nex, to find a way to get rid of that stupid cashregister sound, then believing Beth would have a patch out for major bugs like when you use a terminal and then are stuck in place for no reason. So far Beth has failed a beloved game imho.  Unless you have to have it, as Christmas is around the corner, I would say wait for it to go on sale or after a couple of months and the Modders have fixed it for us.  For the most positive for the game is how you are shown what materials you get from items for example, a typewritter gives you gears, screws, steel, to use for building, enhancing your gun, armor, etc... But you must use some type of adhesive on almost everything but the most basic and guess what, yep the rarest item.   I hated FO3 for being an FPS/RPG, well not anymore, FO3 is by far ahead of FO5 wait sorry i mean 4. I am thanking God I did not spring for the Pip Boy addition when I could afford it. You can use your phone to act like a pip boy if you wish. But beware of the lag that goes with it.  As for graphics, If you can play Skyrim, Batman, BF4, on Normal settings you can play this one. I have a GTX 760 and the recommended settings by the game are ultra, I even turned them down to see if there was a major difference and nope not really.  My review may be all over the place but its like the game, i can't say yay go get it before paying your rent and nor can I say not to get it on sale. Just do not expect this to be the Game of the Year. I am wishing right now I bought Black ops 3 instead of this one.  I pray the modders can make this game great or maybe whomever the creative people who made this realize gamers are not idiots and actually want content for 60 bucks.

Selling Point As any Bethesda game goes, a beautiful and huge landscape to explore, tons of people, crafting, with added settlement building and a voiced main character.  Details Well I finally got around to caring about reviews again and even if I'm the only one that actually reads these bloody things its something to fill up my time. That said, I give you Fallout 4.  TL;DR It's a great game, but its a terrible Fallout game.  The wall of text details section will be split up in order to talk about each part of the game clearly.  Combat Combat is decent as you'd expect with every Fallout game. Other than the small VATS change combat is copy-paste of previous games, which is ok; if it isn't broke don't fix it.  Dialogue This is where an RPG falls flat or shines. And Fallout 4 fell flat off a cliff. I do like the voiced main character, and the dialogue as in voice acting is very well done. The system for dialogue is absolute garbage, however. Dialogue is now reduced to 4 options which, at the end of all ends, decide if you want to do a mission now or later.   While having a voiced main character is nice, it takes away the fact that you are the character and feels more like you are driving someone else around rather than actually being how you would. How was I supposed to know sarcastic meant being an absolute ♥♥♥♥ instead of a light joke? It also takes away quest mods, since suddenly having a mute character, while it being necessary, wouldn't really feel right and splicing lines together would be choppy and worse.  Story This is another part of the game that falls short. The story is basically revenge for the death of your spouse and kidnapping of your son (oh yea, half year old spoiler alert). The character you are supposed to play is already laid out to you before the tutorial starts. What if I don't want to be a concerned parent? The dialogue also represents this, as you bounce from being how you want to be back to concerned parent in dialogue. Murderous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to devotion to your son and back and forth as many times as it can. Doesn't really match up at the end anyways as you can always say I don't give a toss about you and end him yourself.  Settlements Remember E3? What did Fallout 4 get the most cheer for? A mod by the name of Real Time Settler for New Vegas, dumbed down and put into Fallout 4.``We are really looking forward to see what players can build´´ was also known as Todd Howard saying ``We wonder how long we can keep them entertained with this.´´ Simply put, settlements seemed like a fallback plan that they thought everyone would play and be engaged with; it wasn't, it was a Facebook game in my Fallout, and I don't want Facebook games in mah damn Fallout!  Companions Not bad themselves, but badly affected with the dialogue systems. I want to have a conversation with Preston about the Minutemen, I want to know what Hancock does as Mayor, I want to know how Cait's life in the arena was! But I can't. The dialogue isn't dialogue, its the companion wheel shrunk down to only have 4 options. Companions can only be ``talked´´ to at certain times where they reveal the smallest parts of their past, then its back to commanding them as nothing ever happened.  Ye Olde Final Score 5/10 Its comes up short in almost every category compared to older Fallouts. The only improvement I see are graphics and weapon customization, while a lot of features actually downgraded from what they were previously. Don't buy this if you've played any other Fallout games, and if you haven't, I still can't recommend it to you. Theres so much that I didn't cover, from the opener in Concord where you get power armor at level 1 to the derailing of the DLC train. In the end its a very average game, and a terrible Fallout title.",

As others have stated, it doesn't feel like a Bethseda game... at all, due to being strongarmed into the heavily prewritten narrative of your character. It's hard enough to roleplay with the heavy storyline, but any attempt to forget about it and do your own thing is completely negated by the forced voice acting of your character ... the previous games didn't have voice acting for a reason. Bethseda games aren't mass effect. I don't like mass effect for a reason.  The UI is completely, bafflingly terrible, I don't know how they went backwards from their moderate improvements in skyrim, but hoping a mod will fix it (i'm sure the beth devs are hoping for that, too)  Other than those two major gripes... I like it a lot. It's a visually stunningly gorgeous game and the combat is a lot more enjoyable. However, the game feels largely devoid of content, especially with settlements... so I would not recommend this game only played as vanilla. However there are systems in place, code base that wasn't in previous beth games, that makes the prospect of modding exciting. Like equippable armor on nonhuman characters (dogmeat, etc), the whole building and farming thing to begin with, despite how boring it is in vanilla. If the basic codebase wasn't in there to begin with, it would be nearly impossible to mod it in ourselves.  So, a good game by itself? No, depressingly not. A good game in theory with the modding community? Hell yes.  And as much as I'm excited about mods, the fact that bethseda got really lazy due to their expecations of modders filling in the blanks is a bit sad. Yes, they contributed more codebase for us to play with but... I just wish they also focused on the vanilla experiance more.  But perhaps I'm asking too much.

They turned a once proud series of RPG's into a mindless action game. They essentially copied Skyrim but with even less roleplaying elements. This game is actually more of a streamlined mindless action game than Skyrim, if that's even possible to believe.   They completely gutted almost all of the compelexity and role-playing elements. There are no skill points in this game. Yes, you heard right. THERE ARE NO SKILL POINTS. Just let that sink in for a second. There is no repair system. No skills used in dialouge. In fact, there are hardly and soloutions to problems other than go in guns blazing and kill stuff. What New Vegas did amazingly well with multiple soloutions to quests and deep roleplaying elements that make the gameplay unique for your character...all of that is gone.

In fact, that's the other thing. There are no meaningful choices in this game other than 'accept' or 'deny' a quest, a quest which itself does not have multiple soloutions or options. You don't even get to control your own actions. How sad. This game is just so utterly bland and streamlined and simplified.  The story is pretty much non-existant. There's kind of a logical, if not meaningful, story in the main questline but mostly the plot developements feel like excuses for the game to send you somewhere to kill some guys. This is even more apparant in the side quests. They have the most aboslutely hair thin plot lines that connect them (especially the railroad or minutemen quests) that are barely even coherent and logical. It's like the developers just sat down an came up with as many excuses as possible that might get someone to a new location to massacre more raiders. It reeks of minimal effort and laziness. In fact the faction sidequests literally repeat themselves, sending you to the same place to kill the same enemies twice. I've never seen a massive open world game that tricks you into thinking it's so full of content when actually it's so EMPTY. There's nothing interesting to do in this game. No interesting characters. No interesting dialouge. No role-playing.   And I'm just getting warmed up here. There is a host of simple little things to critique about the game. Like for example, this game has a HUGE problem with transparency. It doesn't make the mechanics that clear at all, you don't know how that stats are being used. For example, the speech skill may seem to be a dice roll at first, but in actuallity its fixed. It's based on the color of the dialouge options. yellow = requires 3 charisma, orange = 6, and red = 9. This is just one example, but there are many others.   The game is also incredibly buggy. I won't even try to list all the bugs here because the list is so utterly massive. They include but are not limited to: -vats causing you to teleport -minimizing causing graphical errors -floating or naked people  -one area being innaccessible because it instantly crashes your game and corrupts save files 90% of the time  This is simply an inexcusable amount of bugs, escpecially for a TRIPLE A TITLE THAT COSTS $60, of all things.  I also have to critique the fact that the controls are totally changed around from the previous Fallout games. And a lot of times it's really not clear how to do something. For example, setting up supply lines between settlements is incredibly convoluted and complex and nowhere does it explain how to do it. This isn't the only thing, there's lots of them and the game does nothing to teach you about them.  Another super annoying thing is the dialouge. It's very unpredictable, you basically choose one of four options thats a really simplistic summary of what your character actually is going to say. So it ends up that you don't really know what you're picking and a lot of times your character says something you don't expect. Super frustrating. I guess they did this because 'we don't want to upset the idiots who can't be bothered to read'.  All in all this game is lacking on every front. No story, no emotion, no choice, no consequence, very streamlined and boring character development. It's a pure shooter game and not an RPG. Fallout is dead.",

All technically boil down to 'where is the next group of raiders to kill'  - the world is boring: using same small set of components over and over, like lego blocks. For example there is only one exact patio umberella shared in all locations  - locations are boring: in F3 you could read a story from each place (eg: what happened there after 2077), in F4 each place is just a 'game location' - after you have seen few, you're not interested in exploring  - crafting feels nice at first, but resources are poorly balanced, making you spend 50% of the time hoarding on people's clothes / weapons and traveling to your base to deliver them (due to weight limits). Overall, it makes game much slower.  My suggestion: if you're Fallout fan, play Fallout 3 instead. If you want great RPG, by Witcher 3.",

            "review_text": "TL:DR: Fun, stable, expansive game. It's worth the purchase price, to be sure, but it's not quite what I was expecting or hoping for in a Fallout title. If you like GTA or FarCry, you'll probably like this. If you're into real RPGs and making choices and seeing the results of those choices, or building nuanced, different, interesting characters, skip it.  So I started playing the Fallout series with 3. Someone bought the game for me and I loaded it up and I was astonished that I got to live out a video game childhood and then I got set loose on an entire living world full of people that I could either help or hinder, or even ignore. It was great, but after that initial rush was over, and after the first play-through, I never went back because it suffered from the blandness that Bethesda is now kind of notorious for.  Along comes New Vegas, and, after the technical stuff was fixed, it became my favorite RPG of all time. That world was alive. The things you did for and to people mattered. The world gave you feedback based upon what you did. It felt very real, particularly on the first play-through. it was a deep and complex game that I really cared about. Every character was different, and you could really play nuanced individuals and the whole world would feel just a little different to you every time you did that. It felt like an RPG with fairly good shooter mechanics layered on.  So out comes Fallout 4. I was initially so excited because my most recent memories of the series were of New Vegas. I wanted to feel invested in a game world again. Unfortunately, it feels more like a dumbed-down, first-person shooter version of Fallout 3. It's a shooter with some VERY meager RPG elements layered on. It honestly feels more like GTA V than a Fallout game. You walk around and look at things, and you get spoon fed a little backstory and atmosphere from the world, but it's such a light touch and it feels like you're riding a ride that every other person who bought the game is on.  Don't get me wrong. The world is massive and somewhat dynamic. The art direction is beautiful. The voice acting is actually pretty good most of the time (I was afraid it would be terrible, given Bethesda's history, but it wasn't). I haven't had a lot of technical problems. This is probably the most stable Bethesda release ever. The game makes a FANTASTIC first impression, and without giving any spoilers, you do make an emotional connection with your character and his or her family in the beginning. In the first few hours, you really feel like it's going to be the best game you've ever played.   That fades really fast, though, as you realize that this gigantic, meticulously created world is basically just a big place full of things to shoot, and people who want you to shoot things. I found this note on a super-mutant. It said something like 'kill, loot, return.' That pretty much sums the game experience up fairly well. I stock on on supplies, I go out into the city, I find places on the map, read a terminal or two, pick a lock, and then kill the things that are there. There are a few decent character based quests that I've come across, but nothing like what I experienced in New Vegas. This is the standard 'new' Fallout formula, which is fine, but in this game it's like they spent all their time recording dialogue and very little effort went into actually creating stories, and more importantly, tying those stories together into some kind of cohesive whole that gives feedback based upon the player's actions.  The settlements feature is cool, but it feels mechanically useless most of the time, and its features are kind of poorly fleshed out. Honestly, I'd rather have well-realized towns with interesting people to meet and choices to make that actually matter. I think providing one or two settlement spaces tied extensively to the story would have been a better way to handle this feature, instead of many locations that are just bland tickboxes.  They built a really neat, beautiful world. They provided the terminals and the scenery and the setting for post-nuclear Boston. The stage was set masterfully. Then it kind of feels like they created one adventure on rails and everyone experiences that (you can be either good, good sarcastic, or evil... which is just terrible for an RPG... there seems to be no grey area). Even the way the leveling works kind of funnels you to certain locations before others, so no more deciding where you're going to go because it feels like your character would go there. You get on the 'Mass Effect' like ride, complete with dialogue wheel (sigh, it's as terrible and predictable as it sounds) and you do basically the same thing every other player is doing.  It's a solid, good, and even fun game. I don't think I've felt more conflicted about a game in a long time, and this is after eagerly waiting for YEARS for news about it. I'm not recommending it, though, because pretty much everyone playing a Fallout game nowadays expects a Fallout game, and this just feels kind of like GTA V without cars or some Bioware title where you are on rails most of the time.  After the masterpiece, work of art, splendid RPG that was New Vegas, this just feels very bland, on rails, and poorly fleshed-out. After all the waiting and the hype and the expectation that they would evolve more than just the technical aspects of the engine, and actually provide a deeper RPG expereince alongside the better shooting mechanics, it kind of feels like a bit of a disappointment.  I won't be buying anymore of their RPGs until I read a lot of player reviews, because they seem to be heading in the dumbing-down, mass market, pretty colors / big explosions / be the hero design direction. If you're into that kind of game, that's fine. Enjoy them. Fallout 4 just doesn't give me the same feeling I got in Vault 101 or, even more so, as the Courier, though. I always feel too constrained, or like if they had simply tried a little harder, a good quest, npc, location, or DECISION, could have been better and felt more real to me as the player. It feels like a gigantic, dense, pretty world filled with those animatronic people you see on amusement park rides… most of whom you just shoot at.  It's just flat, on-rails melodrama, most of the time. After like 50 hours I really don't care where my son went or whether Mama Murphy takes drugs or not. I didn't want to play as a guy with a son. I don't want to wander the wasteland looking for a son. Even if I did, the game pacing is just... wrong... for this kind of story. Is this an RPG or a network made-for-TV movie? It started out fine, but the forced emotional, on-rails trope gets old fast.  It starts out feeling amazing, and the longer you play the more you really start to see its shortcomings.  That being said, there is a lot of content and it's great for killing some time. The shooting mechanics are alright, although the enemies are bullet-sponges on anything above normal, so it feels very arcade-y and a bit dumb.  I regret buying the strategy guide. I think I've used it once, to figure something out with power conduits in the settlements. I'll probably give it to someone for Christmas, and that right there pretty much tells me how I feel about this entry in the series… Wow I'm depressed now. Sad Vault Boy is sad (and I'm wearing a Vault Boy t-shirt right now, which should give you a hint how much I have loved the series in the past).  I feel like Bethesda let the RPG portion of its fan base down with this title. I feel like they dumbed the game down substantially. I feel like they want sales over substance. I don't like how they treated the gaming press with that 'embargo of an embargo' thing. I think it's bad when game developers become icon / rock star archetypes because this kind of thing seems to inevitably happen to the product over time… So yeah… End wall of text.",

            "review_text": "First off, I just want to say that although my review is negative, I still thoroughly enjoyed the game. If you're new to the fallout franchise, you will most likely enjoy this game and get your money's worth. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to any fans of the previous Fallout games. The game is just not as in-depth as previous fallout games. Anyway, I'll write up my review in a series of lengthy pros and cons.  PROS: -The combat is just as great as the previous two fallout games. You can be as creative as you want in the ways you kill people. The only thing holding you back is your imagination. And, once again, bloody mess makes its return for those gore enthusiasts. -The map size. I've seen many complain that it's small, but I personally think that it's the perfect size. Nearly everywhere you go you'll find something to do, even if it is small. Gone are the days where a mountain takes up a massive chunk of the map. -The story. It is rather short, but it has kept my interest so far. I still haven't fully completed it, though, due to the amount of side exploration in the game. -The graphics are, in my opinion, very beautiful. On ultra, at least. I haven't tested anything below. Yes, the graphics may look somewhat outdated to some, and they may be different from the other fallout games' graphics, but they are still visually appealing. -The voice acting of everyone but the protagonist (I'll get to him in the CONS). I thought the voice actors were really great and fleshed out in this game. The voices perfectly matched up with each character, and each voice had a personality to it. I especially like Curie's french accent.  NEUTRAL: -Crashing. I figured I'd put this inbetween, as it does not effect everyone. I haven't had a single crash yet, but others have reported it.  CONS: -The bugs. Oh man, the bugs. This game is riddled with tiny (and huge) bugs that varies from player to player. Want to make an expansive settlement where everyone is happy? Too bad! You're not allowed to! There is a widely known bug where your settlement resources (mainly water and defense) reduce to 0 when you're away, which decreases your settlement happiness. As an aside: it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers some, but it's still something that needs to be fixed. -The companion AI. The backstories to the companions are interesting, which is something I would have put in the PROS section, but everything else about them is terrible. They do little to nothing in terms of combat. They constantly get in the way (At least you can command them to move). And this may just be happening to me, but my companions seem to be suicidal. They LOVE jumping off of buildings and making me waste a stimpak on them. As always, though, they're great for lugging around useless junk. -Voiced protagonist (This is for the male voice actor only. I haven't heard the female). Some like it, most don't. I happen to be in the latter category. I find that it takes away from the immersive roleplaying aspect that was in the previous games. I would be fine with it, though, if the voice actor didn't constantly sound bland and confused. He also speaks in low tones at the most random of times.  -FPS/Stuttering. Even on top tier machines people are reporting issues with FPS in certain areas, namely cities. My FPS in the wasteland is a constant 60 fps on ultra, but when I walk into a city there's a massive drop in my FPS for a couple seconds. -And, finally, we come to the crowning glory of CONS: The dialogue choices. It is the worst of the worst, and it caters only to console players. As opposed to the other fallout games, there are only four options to choose from, and they are almost always the same in every situation: Yes (Bottom. The good choice); No (Right. The bad choice); Maybe/unsure/sarcastic (Left. The neutral choice); Question (Top. Neutral. He simply answers with a question). Not only is there a lack of choices, but there is also a lack of clarity. The choices are almost always one worded (You get the occasional two word choice. Oh my, what a treat!), and you never know what your character is going to actually say based on that choice. He tends to say something completely different from what you  expected, and you often times find yourself face-palming at his choice of words.  So yeah, those are my PROS and CONS for Fallout 4. Decided whether the game is worth it for you or not from them. Or don't. That's cool, too.  Tl;dr: The game is good in some respects, but terrible in others. I personally enjoyed it, but there are too many kinks in it at this current time for me to give it a positive review.",

First of all (and this is the one that pisses me off the most) 70% of the quests are repeat quests where you either have to get something for someone or you have to clear an area. In the past Fallouts even with the hundreds of quests, the quests were all unique and exciting not just someone telling you to go do something for them. So basically after you beat the main quest line you are done with the game. If you didn't do the quests you wouldn't be missing anything whatsoever. Also the settlement building isn't very exciting because you rarely get attacked and if you do it's only by a couple of enemies so you don't even need defense. Overall I would give this game a 5/10. I have no desire to come back to Fallout 4 and play it again like I wanted to in the other Fallouts. It's crazy how Fallout 4 could have been worked on for so long and STILL feel like it was unfinished.

Often tells you there is no direct path and that is it, you are on your own. Quest descriptions will not help you much either. Youtube is often the only way to find out WTH is going on there. 3) The number of endless loading screens made me buy new SSD, so I would not bite my fingers off while waiting.

And that story path is not that interesting.  Even the new settlement building system feels clunky and pointless. There's no good tutorial of how to expand your settlement, I had to find that out via googling, and I have pretty much nothing to gain.   As far as settlement building goes, I'd rather play the Sims or Minecraft, and as far as First Person Shooters go I'd rather play one of those military shooter games (CoD etc), which is fine, because those areas are not the forte of Fallout. However, what is supposed to be the strong point of this game, RPG, has been watered down to try to appease console CoD fans and Minecraft kids with the other features of the game, and thus Fallout 4 ends up being mediocre at everything it does.  *SPOILERS*  The beginning is anti-climactic when you start off in a really interesting location, pre-war Boston, and can't even exit your house before the mayhem starts. There is no chance to devoloping emotional attachment to the pre-war world, the community you live in or even your family before you're railroaded into the vault. Then, in the vault your spouse is killed and you baby taken while you can do precisely nothing. No role playing, just a bad plot thrust at you after 10 minutes. Then, when you finally encounter the killer and kidnapper, they behave all calm and dignified and you respond pretty much the same way. Again, no role playing. Yeah, you can cuss at them but that's about it. Oh, yeah, and you mutually agree like mature adults to fight to the death. No drama necessary.",

Lots of bugs that sometimes require you to restart the game. The graphics are mediocre, pretty sure they used the same for Skyrim. And now being a higher level I find myself with nothing else to do. The settlements are a HUGE disappointment. It had so much potential to be a useful mechanic of the game but I'm left with a population cap and gaining next to nothing from all the work put in.  While I was leveling, I really loved the game. It was the right mixture of difficulty and bad-assery. Maybe I should have expected less, but this game has been in development for years and the hype was huge.",

            "review_text": " Not recommended.   Only buy it on a very cheap sale or wait until the ultimate edition (and that on sale.)  They lost my brand loyalty, will never buy a BGS game full price again. ================================================================= There are so many points to cover on this game; nearly all the reviews hit on how Fallout 4 is less of an RPG and more of a shooter with a terrible story. I of course agree, but to avoid writing another one of those typical reviews I want to touch on Bethesda, their modding intervention and the money milking. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Summed up this is Bethesda and their modding intervention: BGS is like a father that left you in an abandon cabin surrounded by a forest, easy to get lost, with only a few tools for survival. You learn how to use the tools and how to survive, you begin to flourish in your new life and a huge community begins to surround you with you being the head-honcho of everything. Then one day your long lost dad from decades ago comes back to you and tries to make decisions for your new community and wants to take it over with only him being the head of it all.   This is what BGS did. They left us with simple modding tools and we became a huge, flourishing community spanning many sites. Then over a decade later (or so) BGS decides to butt in on our perfect community and change how it all works. Just one day out of nowhere they come in and change so much while trying to lord over us. Within a week, they nearly destroyed a community that's been together longer than many newcomers to modding and the seires have been alive.   Bethesda.net  is the worst thing to ever happen to the community, I would take Paid Mods over  Bethesda.net  any day.  Bethesda.net  is like a free upload site honestly; there's no moderation, no safety, nothing to protect modder's work, even the modder's themselves are in danger because they get hacked, DDos (or whatever,) get death threats, their locations are revealed from the DDos and so much more. It's like walking into a cage of rabid animals.  Finally. Finally. Finally. This also ties in with  Bethesda.net . The modding competition through  Bethesda.net  that Nvidia is doing. Grand prize is 10k? And a bunch of other really good stuff. It's a really good competition. However, it is broken beyond belief. People have reuploaded other people's mods, people have cheated the votes somehow and one of the top voted mods has ripped content from other games. This alone is illegal and the owners of the assets could press extreme copyright charges. But now he's probably going to win because he cheated the votes and used assets, almost entirely, from other games and even other modders. The competition was intended to be an actual competition where modders would have made new and amazing mods, instead it's just already uploaded content competing. Obviously Bethesda couldn't simply think 'let's put a restriction on it that the mod can't be published over one week old to enter' or something.  Nexus, a site that's ran by people we don't even know, was able to properly run a modding competition better than official Bethesda. When people like you and I are able to host a competition with no issues and the competetors were legit, while a big company like Bethesda can't - there's something wrong there. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Money milking. Unless you're blind of daft, you can see how Bethesda pulled an EA on us. They raised the price of the Season Pass an promised us even more DLCs. We all knew there would be at least one workshop DLC, but I don't think anyone was ready for having four, dirt cheap in content DLCs that just use in-game content with only two short and pathetic story DLCs (just assuming Nuka World is going to be as bad as Far Harbor.)  The DLCs aren't even worth one dollar if they tried to sell it, let alone being in a 'Season Pass.' The content in these DLCs (aside from the two stories) should've been in the free udpates of new content they promised, which we never recieved aside from very minor additions and fixes - fixes that just ruin even more things.  Just going to throw this in here, but I can't believe BGS has the audacity to actually release a Skyrim remaster. This was a running joke within the community a few years after Skyrim was released. The fact that they're doing it is.. That's the real joke. Not only that! But they're bringing mods to Skyrim on  Bethesda.net  too and for consoles, when they can't even get their ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥ straight with Fallout 4. I don't know what's happened to these people. --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Obsidian, you're our only hope. You're the chosen one!  Hell anyone would be better than BGS as this point if this is their new way of making games and wrecking communities. I really like BGS, they made my all-time favorite games, but there's no way I can support their new practices under any stretch. Hopefully they learned of their mistakes with Fallout 4 and will remember it when they make the next TES (or any game.)",

            "review_text": "So I have been playing fallout 4 for a while now and have been reading the reviews. From what I see the game is getting negtive reviews because of... Pretty pathetic reasons. This game, in my opinion, is really good and sure, it did not live up to my expectations all the way but I don't think any hyped game came out 'perfect'.  I think the main problem with the negitive views was the hype. This game was really hyped and for good reason. Years of development and potential was put into this game but people expected this game to be groundbreaking, revoloutionary, a game that everyone can have hours of fun in. But hype is not aways a good thing. Hype rurrined this game. Our expectations were waaaaaaaaaay too high for this game and this is what is making people upset.  Reading some of the 'cons' people have written about the game is so pathetic. Most of them are tiny details that honestly don't even matter. I honestly found myself laughing about the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the reviewers pulled out of their ♥♥♥♥. Some of my favorates negitive said things are : Big skill tree, people quickly getting out of bed when you talk to them, you can quicky demolish building in editor mode and enimes falling out of the sky.  When I started playing, I HATED the new dialouge mechanic. 'Only 4 options of converstaions? What a downgrade.' But now I have been playing for a while now and honestly, its not that bad. Sure, more options would be nice but its really not much of a big deal.  I am still upset about removal of skill points but I guess I can handle that. I would get a mod if someone will make one.  I do agree the game feels less like a RPG because of removal of skill points, removal of the kama system, ect. On that note I can't BELIEVE they removed the karma system. This was a really bad move in my opinion and removes great role-playing aspects.   Fallout is known for being different from other games for its RP aspects. The RP elements is what seperated Fallout 4 from games like Far Cry, Just Cause and lots of other open-world games. Fallout 4 still has lots of RP elements, just not as many as Fallout 1 and New Vegas (Not 1 and 2, entirely different games)  With all these aspects in mind, I think its good Bethesda done this. Yes, removal of karma, no skill points, removal origonal speech options, ect is all a good thing and for some of them I dont think Bethesda can be blamed for it.  Think about it: If Bethesda kept the dialouge from Fallout 3 the same in Fallout 4, players would call the game out on being too much like fallout 3 and not much improvements. With Bethesda experementing with new dialouge options, they can see what fans like and dislike and with this infomation improve their next games witht he infomation of what works or not. I think this applies to all of the game elements people are upset about.  Yes, people say 'Fallout 4 is just a re-hash of fallout 3!' Which i think is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Say if Bethesda used the old dialouge system, players would call that out of being copied from Fallout 3 and nothing new is being added. So to avoid this, Bethesda tried to add a new dialouge system, different from Fallout 3 and New Vegas so people wont moan that the dialouge system is the same as last time and their is no new content. I think game reviewers are responsible for this. When a game developer tries to make a sequel to a game they try to make it seem differnet to avoid hate.  Also, why is it a bad thing that Fallout 4 'may' use lots of origonal material from Fallout 3 and New Vegas? Fallout 3 and New Vegas are great games and have lots of elements that would work well in Fallout 4. I dont see why people complain about this. Don't we gamers want a sequel to New Vegas, not a ENTIRE DIFFERENT GAME that removes lots of elements that makes Fallout 'Fallout'. Jesus Christ just because Fallout 4 uses content from its old games does not make it bad its a good thing. Its like if The Elder Scrolls went from a first-person RPG medieval game to a FPS futureistic game. We dont want this!! But apparently we want this in Fallout 4... God.  I still laugh at people complaining about graphics. Those people dont deserve to play video games. Trust me, we DONT WANT a super realistic post-apocalyptic game. We want Fallout, and thats what we got.  Most of the negitive reviews are kinda stupid. Just people moaning about the dialouge system. Kinda annoying.   Hey, if you read this far, thanks! Sorry for bad spelling and gramma. You see... I don't care. Thanks!",

It was fun for a while, and I got a lot of playtime out of it without really advancing the story much at all.   Settlement creation is fun if you're into Sims-like building. (Which I am) But it's extremely distracting for that reason. And the novelty wears off after a few settlements are fully built. What I noticed after a while is that, not only is the combat extremely 2 dimensional and mundane, but there aren't really very many different types of enemies.  The crafting system for guns and armor was not nearly as epic as it was made out to be. The mods are fairly bland and the number of unique weapons, while technically high, is full of mostly implausible options that once you upgrade your ability to craft, are replaced with something better and leave the old mods in the dust. I end up with the same scoped plasma pistol every time.  All and all, good for mindless fun, but since I got bored with this, I started playing New Vegas, and this game cannot compare.

I began playing the game and i was hoocked for life. Then the following game came, fallout 2. Equal in style and ever more impressive it was not just bigger and better, but it had the story of the previously game molded into it, feeling brand new, but also familiar.  Then the fallout 3 came. The rules changed, everything was improved. 3d who would had imagined the game surviving to this point. And the game went into the book of ledgends as the ultimate post-apocalyptic game.  We old and new loved this change not only because they added the new and improved, but they kept the story and the core basic systems.   -The SPECIAL stats continually add bonuses to skills. -Skills represent a character's chance of successfully performing a group of specific tasks (such as firing a gun, or picking a lock) -The player also selects three Tag Skills. -The PERK`S is determined by the players (skills %) at certaint lvl`s. -And the never altered the fallout lore, rules or story.  But back to fallout 4. Many things can be said about it, but is has some positivity to it.  +Good graphic  But sadly this is all i can say honestly to be positive.  on the other side.  -Perks, special`s and skills in general is made in a ridiculous way. -Altering the lore of the power armor to use (fuel cells). As previously game did not have this, and it is not combat efficient at all. (The Brotherhood dissprove of this fuel cell) -Placing wath appears to be skyrim developers to make a fallout game (conclusion came when legendary gear and bosses appeared on screen) -Make the map smaller at the cost of graphic`s -Made it more 1person shooter than an actual RPG-game.  Following is grind based, and unnecessary. And only used to make the game feel longer. As previously games has relied on (bottle caps and random scavaging + quest rewards) -Getting resources to build your village(es). -Getting resources to uppgrade your armor. -Getting resources to uppgrade your weapons (since skills no longer exist to boost dammage) -Getting resources to make medical supplies.  Do not think i wrote this lightly. I am a huge fan of the fallout universe and have played and finished them all more than once:  Fallout 1  Fallout 2 Fallout Tactics: Brotherhood of Steel Fallout 3 (Operation: Anchorage, The Pitt, Broken Steel, Point Lookout and Mothership Zeta) Fallout: New Vegas (Dead Money, Honest Hearts, Old World Blues, Lonesome Road)  I feel nothing than a stab in the back as the game stepps closer to skyrim and not the fallout universe itself.  Bethesda you should be proud of yourself for making a game so state of the art in graphic, and so far away from the game mechanics we old players loved, that you utterly ruined the known fallout universe.

I do NOT play Fallout so I can be in the Walking Dead. However, that appears to be what this game is.  Walk into a ruined town, get mobbed by 20 feral ghouls. See a cabin, approach slowly. Get mobbed by 5 feral ghouls. Walk into a railroad station, get mobbed by 10 feral ghouls. Walk into a building, guess what! Feral ghouls.  And when I saw mobbed, I mean it. These are 'running zombie' fast. Hell, more like 'teleport zombie' fast. They arent so bad if theres a few, but its a giant pain when you've got 20 zipping at you.  I'm sick of f'n feral ghouls.

            "review_text": "Update 60+ hours of play - Somewhere between 20-40 hours it got 'fun' but then so did all of the glaring plot issues and bugs so be warned. Power Armor appears to cause these bugs. I have hit 2 quests that if you have power armor the quest breaks, wiki's will help. Had time to play my friends console (P4), same sorts of issues overall. The story get pretty liniar with 3 core factions I am so far disapointed in the overall path pushed but feel there are plenetly of quests to keep you busy and leveling. Speaking of leveling now that I am use to the system. I do like it. As for the building a base, big letdown. Overall if your fan you will enjoy it, if your not sure, save your caps for now.  Update: 20 hours of play - I will admint I am beeing pretty harsh overall but I have a lot to expect from an expensive AAA game that just made Bethesda a boat load of money and they hyped the heck out of it.  The game takes a bit of time to grow on you. In typical Bethesda style the game has a lot of rough spots typical of their recent releases, NPC pathing is bad. I recently had the boss enemy of one quest totaly fall off the building he was in and kill himself before I knew he was the bad ♥♥♥.   Speeking of NPC's if you start the game and notice a realy powerfull gun behind an locked case you can't access. Turns out one of the NPC's has a bit of an exploit to help you aquire that gun earler in the game then I think was intended. I don't want to post a spoiler here but lets just say I am not sure the NPC's ablity was intended to work with locked items.  The UI is HORRID! This is so bad that even on the console versions my friends have the same issues and complaints. (PC) In many places the TAB key is the back button but its the final back that changes to ESC. (PS 4) My coworkers that have consoles say the same issue on their end exists, using something like STAR and chaning at the last dialog to SQUARE or TRIANGLE not sure what they said. Another issue is in building a base when your inside a building that takes up your view TAB is also 'select' that item so now you cant change dialog options because your moving the dam building element. You have to find and empty part of the structure that dosn't have any parts to properly select the item you want from your menus.   Buildings: Still useless for the mostpart but I did cheat on one save to see if it ever becomes usefull. The answer is yes eventually becuase once your high enough level you can attract merchants.  Power Armor: My inital thoughts (below) were that it felt like cheating. After 20 hours of play I can say nope its dam well the only thing your likley to give a crank about. You will want to scav every core and save them for when you realy need that power armor becuase its the only thing that has saved me a number of times in combat. I do feel you get enough cores if your scroung and trade for them.  Combat - Intense. Even with good armor and a good supply of weapons I find that I need to change my guns out for ones with ammo, or do more stealth, use cover etc.  V.A.T.S = CRAP, Criticals are now a charge meeter that you have to activate in VATS to use. I see no diffrence using VATS and JET. Both are just bullet time.   The Second screen PipBoy app! Love it, its very usefull and if you have a smart phone well worth the minor install and config issue to make it work.   Graphics, they just don't feel rich enough. I think mods and DLC will change this with time.  Plot line - pretty linear this time around, your choices to be bad are at least so far limited. In general many more NPC's are considered 'critical' and you cant kill them. My character has a charisma of 9 and two persuasion perks and still I am frequently unable to persauade people in dialog. (this is supprising since I basicly wanted more options and in a few places its usefull to avoid combat) the investment in points in this regard are not paying the dividents I had hoped for. Another ding for the UI using freeking arrow keys for dialog options, hate it.  On a posittive note, there is a ton of content to explore and if you keep a look out there are many situations where you can be entertained by the sugested position of items or bodys etc to get a feel for what happend in that space.  Overall still feel they need a decent update to address a number of issues but the game is a bit more playable at this stage. Bethasda seem to allow for some very genious community updates and changes to their products and I don't think Fallout 4 will be any exception. I look forward to the mod communities contrubtions to filling in the vacuos holes Bethesda seems to have left.   Early Review - 4.5 hours:  In a word - Underwhelming  So 4.5 hours in and I can say that I am not really happy with this game. I love the series so I will put up with it but save your money for a sale.  Details: Well they tried and failed in a number of areas, day 1 patch needed, feels like some parts are unfinished, the building settlements bit for instance feels lacking. Lack of adequate tutorial. AI pathing is a joke. I have had enemies falling off buildings, not shot, just running at you, fall and die. Too many chems I guess. Early power armor access feels like a cheat (update turns out its needed)   If your playing this on a PC be prepared to feel the pain of the crap console UI forced on you. Even that is not intuitive. For instance when looting and manipulating stuff the keys change so picking up stuff goes from say E to R and then getting out of a menu goes from ESC to Tab but when that occurs is very jarring and distracting. You now get 4 dialog options at a time and you have to use the mouse or the arrow keys.   VATS - Say good buy to turn based RPG play. VATS is now bullet time. Worse is in combat if you have an ally, and the friendly AI kills the last enemy while you are trying to select your point of fire with vats, it will automatically target friendlies thus if your not careful you will shoot your ally.  If it sounds like I am being too critical that is because for $60 and all the hype I had higher expectations. Even the graphics on ultra dosn't impress.   The Story so far - I won't provide spoilers but I will say that given the events that put you in the vault and what happens as you get out I would have expected a few more breadcrumbs or plot points to engage me. Its early so take this part of the review with a big grain of salt. The NPC's that I have encoutnered and side quests just don't have the conversation depth I had hoped for, that said they are all are voice acted. (update above)  The Environment – Its expansive but feels off, by that I mean the physics are not clean, the world should be more destructible and interactive and I honestly think that since the primary focus seems to have been on console players that they didn't make the world as interactive because of that. Now I could be totally off base on this and it may be that the UI is just getting in the way.  Sync audio to npc mouth/body- This is a huge gripe for me, the audio dialog of the NPC's doesn't feel right when you watch them, the mouths are out of sync and the body language is either absent or not in tune with what is being said. If you like voice over kung fu movies then you will love the dialog with NPC's  The moderately good: The “second screen” pip-boy app for android &amp; ios devices, that actually is dam cool and useful as well.   I started to get sucked into building a house/town. That's very different for the fallout franchise so it takes some getting use to and it feels clunky at first but after a bit of practice you can loot out a town and turn it into your own kingdom. I haven't seen a need for it yet but it can side track you for some time. (update above)  Overall, I would say unless you are a huge fan and dont mind the rough edges then it might be worth it to you. For the rest, save your money for a sale and don't have high expectations.",

While there's a lot of good and bad aspects of this game, my number one complaint is simply how old it feels. The mechanics feel clunky, and the graphics are very ugly considering it is a AAA title. Horrendous voice acting and awkward movement animations makes the overall experience very lackluster.  The PC optimization is also lacking. It performs worse than other better-looking titles like The Witcher 3 and GTA5. Mouse acceleration and Vsync is also turned on by default, and you have to go and edit the .ini files yourself to change it.  I really wanted to like this game. I barely got to experience the story and the RPG elements of the game, as the poor gameplay prevented me from progressing at all.  All of these problems could've been solved if Bethesda had bothered chaning to a newer, more efficent game engine. Instead, they decided to release a game without any new innovations. Bethesda really disappointed me with this release.",

            "review_text": "Technically and mechanically, this is an amazing game. Bethesda did what they do best in creating the world space and atmosphere for this game. The Commonwealth is full of fun and exciting places to explore, many of them unmarked, and the experience of exploring these places is very rewarding.  The engine is a definite improvement upon that used in previous Bethesda Fallout releases. Many of the technical issues from previous games have been corrected and the mechanics are much smoother, though there are still issues and some mechanics do not work as they should [vendors showing up with no stock, 'level 4' vendors not arriving at the settlements they've been recruited to]. I have mixed feelings about how many of the new features added to the game are almost directly ported from popular mods from previous games; they could have changed things up a bit to add their own spin or flavor to them.  As great as Bethesda is at making world spaces, they demonstrate with this title that they still have a lot to learn about open worlds and giving players choices. I'm estimating that I'm about 75% of the way through the main story and I'm disappointed by how little choice there is. Players must complete main story items in a linear fashion with no deviation allowed. The player does have some choice, however, in choosing when to pursue the main story line. I took a three game month break between elements just to explore and build communities while I leveled up my character.  Also, as is typical with Bethesda games, there are countless technical flaws in the writing and consistency of this game. When I was new to the game I would gleefully explore pre-war ruins, hoping to find some cool new weapon inside a safe that's been hidden away for two hundred years only to find.... another pipe weapon? Similarly, they have taken liberties with Fallout lore by putting things like Jet, which did not exist in the Fallout universe until after the war, in vaults and making them part of Vault-Tec experiments.  People who have been born in the 2200's seem to know how people lived and acted hundreds of years before their time despite the lack of history books. One companion even makes an idle comment about spending a lot of time in the back seat of a car. How in the world would she even know what that means, let alone have access to a working vehicle with any kind of frequency?  ...and the biggest technical flaw is [this paragraph will be a bit of a spoiler, read at your own risk] buying into the Hollywood notion that dogs somehow have the magical ability to track scents over great distances and over a span of time. It doesn't work the way they tried to pass it off in this game. ...not to mention that the person being tracked had a three month head start and it was raining in the game when I followed this part of the main quest and I had previously visited the building I tracked him to at least three times.  I found myself tremendously disappointed by the selection and aesthetics of the weapons in this game as well. We went from FALs in Fallout 2 to R91s and Chinese Assault Rifles [that look much like modern day AK family weapons] to pipe firearms that would be more at home in a Metro game and streamlined, space-age looking assault rifles that looked like they would be more at home in Bioshock than in this game. Traditionally, Fallout reserves the Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon look for energy weapons, not ballistic weapons - those have previously been real life historical items or based on them. Don't even get me started on revolver rifles [there's a reason they never caught on] or suppressed pipe revolvers [possible when designed to be suppressed and precision machined to exact specifications, certainly not possible with something cobbled together out of pipes and spare parts!].  The story felt very much like the player was being railroaded into joining the Railroad faction, to the point that the unique weapon the player receives from one of their very early missions is, in my opinion, the most overpowered and broken weapon in the game.  Summary:  On a technical level, this is an absolutely fun and amazing game. 11/10 without Falllout in the title.  As a Fallout game, this title is disappointing and lacking in humor, consistency, adherence to established lore, and leaves the player with almost zero choice or opportunity to express themself. There was a key moment in the story when it would have been appropriate and very Falloutish to tell someone 'Shut up and listen. I brought you into this world and I can take you out...', but the only choice the player has is to let this person drone on about how the future will be better and all they have to do is wait and see. 2/10  This game would have been better as a reboot of the Fallout franchise instead of a sequel to the previous games.",

            "review_text": "Fallout 4 is an amazing game with an incredible scope, numerous options and playable for hours on end. However, it is a victim of its time, and for each novelty feature, it also presents a slew of problems that ultimately weigh it down. Despite it being an amazing package overall, it has flaws that can break the game.  So 4 is a sequel to Fallout 3. New Vegas was pretty much disregarded when writing 4 and it only concerns itself with east coast affairs as a result. You are a war hero from the Sino-American wars from a few years ago. Living in a small town with your wife and new-born child when the bombs finally come falling down. You’re rushed into a vault and frozen for 200 years. Somewhere in that time, thugs come and steal your son from another pod and kill your spouse in the process. After finally awaking from your frigid slumber you stagger into the commonwealth of Massachusetts that has been scourged and changed by the nuclear destruction. Armed with serious chip on your shoulder, all the weapons in the world and housekeeping robot you start your search for your son and the dirt bags that took him.   Contrary to earlier Fallout games, 4 lets you play as a pre-war survivor, who finds him/herself in the not-so-amazing world of the future. This is fine, but the developers have decided to give your character a voice, a personality and an agenda. This is where the first deal breaker rears its ugly head. The whole aspect of roleplaying is nearly forgone to display shiny production values. You are playing Bethesda’s character, not whoever you want to play. It didn’t bother me at first, but after a good few hours of horribly paced exposition and tediously slow and unintuitive conversation mechanics I was pretty fed up with the sassy survivor. In 3 and New Vegas, your character would develop over the course of the game. It was your projection; that is now gone. Other games also force you to play some character, but at least they’re honest about it. Commander Shepherd and Geralt are both fully fleshed out characters, but at least they act on your accord. Your Fallout 4 hero is either a jerk, a sarcastic jerk or a mewling sap. Granted, some of the lines are comical, but it’s weeding through a forest of bland retorts to find the hidden treasures.   Luckily, Bethesda does allow you to properly customise weapons. You can upgrade most guns with better recoil reduction, more damage output, sights, scopes, lager magazines, the works. The same is true for armour and power armour. The power armour in particular saw a massive overhaul. It is now akin to a vehicle and offers considerably more protection and movement options than 3’s steel pyjamas. Every upgrade, be it to gun or armour, also results in the item’s appearance changing accordingly. A lot of effort went into allowing an extremely varied approach for each player when it comes to equipment. However, there is a downside here too. Upgrades cost resources and resources are scarce. You have to scavenge and salvage to get enough glue, wire, metal and other junk to make that suppressor. It is great to see that all the junk in Fallout finally gets a use beyond the junk launcher, but it becomes such a dominating enterprise to have to find stuff it takes away from the experience. You’re literally doing work to play the game. I was trying to escape work by playing a game, but nope. Surviving is hard work.   Speaking of escaping work, I noticed that Fallout 4 wants me to settle down instead of exploring. That seems to be an awkward reversal of the original design philosophy. Besides guns, you can also customise and upgrade settlements. Ripping pages from the Minecraft book, you can build shacks with your scavenged materials and make them comfortable homes for you and your new friends (most of your new friends are boring btw, so get them a shack to leave and forget them). Again though, materials and other requirements make this a chore rather than a fun experience. It gets worse when one of your friends, the infamous Preston Garvey continues to invite enemies (I swear, he is the one behind it all) into your new settlements just so you get to have something to do.  There is another thing; procedurally generated quests. That’s an indie buzzword and Bethesda slammed it in here like it was a good idea. Newsflash, they’re not, they’re awful, every single one of them. I can’t even properly begin to outline the disaster they are, but imagine that you were doing something boring and then some clown shows up to tell you to go there and get even more bored, while also risking your life. That’s just great. It seems that Bethesda added every neat “modern” gameplay mechanic into their game. Crafting, quest generation, voice acting; It’s all here, not optimised and at times even detrimental.   When you do follow the game’s storyline you have time to admire the amazing detail on the enemy designs, then stunning vistas and gratifying explosions you throw out there. Boston and the commonwealth look great. There is enought to explore to keep you busy for a long time. Some locales also add some neat easter eggs and references. There's even a horribly irradiated horror wasteland that finally puts all the visual enhancements to work. It has to be my favourite part of the game because it actually is a desolate and dangerous part of the wasteland. You can also add some mods to make it look even better…. Oh yeah, Bethesda, king of all moddable games decided that when you use mods, you don’t get to win achievements. I had to get a workaround because I will not be denied. Then my game was running funnily. Turned out updates to everything messed up the driver, so I had to tweak my GPU to stop running the lock pick game at 1500 fps. True to Bethesda’s MO, it is not a game without technical issues. I’ve had crashes to desktop, with or without mods; lockups; getting trapped in the scenery; corrupted save files; bugged npc’s; broken quests; and I think I have fallen through the floor a good number of times. Certainly, a flawed piece. Not a masterpiece, just a piece.  When you add it all up, it paints a bleak picture. There are so many things to do, but they’re mostly pointless. Building a town? Useless to the game, but you can make a Youtube video about it. Another feature that has been added for the sake of social media. Why go on a quest, when the reward is completely negligible? Everything is for naught. You can do it, but it doesn’t help the main campaign or your final goal. Even the grand finale ends on a downer. The whole game is just depressing. If you have this kind of money to blow, buy something more focussed. Want a big world to explore? Get the Witcher 3. Want to craft stuff? You can buy Space Engineers, Kerbal and Minecraft for this money if you play your cards right. Do you want to dress up in power armour and stomp around the irradiated wastes with a giant machine gun, laying waste to all manner of horrors? Then you’re going to need Fallout 4, or Metroid Prime. At least Samus doesn’t open her mouth in that game to spout a dumb one-liner for the sake of a sarcastic dialog option. Despite having spent over 100 hours, the final experience was a dissapointment.  ",

But Bethesda's biggest error was they tried to appeal to as many audiences as possible abandoning the concepts of Fallout and the role-playing genre in the process. The protagonist is voiced, already has a backstory, and is stuck being the 'good guy'. Skills are removed in favor of a 'streamlined' perk system that allows unlimited leveling so you're basically a god by the late game stages. And icing on the cake is once you've finished the game there is hardly anything left for you to do!

By endgame I felt my choices made little to no difference. Especially since pretty much any faction you join basically tells you to kill ALL the other factions. Little choice there. Yes, I there IS a way to not have to kill off anyone but the main 'bad' faction, but does it matter? NOPE. You get the EXACT SAME ENDING no matter what happens. It's short, pathetic, and no where near a worthy successor to the massive ending choices in New Vegas. I left 4 feeling like I had played a Call Of Doody knock off, and that made me livid.

You follow a linear set path for a character and that's it, there is a few different dialogue options that don't lead anywhere, and the few choices you can make in this game are; who you're character falls in love with, and what faction you want to become affiliated with. The factions are definitely cool I'll say and it's an improvement from Fallout 3 and much more like New Vegas, and Fallout 1 and 2.  The shooting in this game feels good, really good for a Fallout game, and it's a welcome surprise to anyone who would have played the previous Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Everything else though especially the level up system just feels off somewhat, it doesn't feel like Fallout at all, and while I'll say that the Fallout level up system is extremely bare bones and simple, the new one doesn't feel that much more innovative or RPG like.   The crafting system is really good actually, picking up every object in the game actually means something this time and gives a reason to pick up tin cans and wonderglue, and the settlement stuff can be quite extensive but somewhat disappointing considering what you can't do with it, but it's optional and pretty cool nontheless.   I can say Bethesda took 2 steps back with this one and 1 step forward. It's better than Fallout 3 overall but it doesn't hold a candle to the original Fallouts and New Vegas.   I can probably recommend this game for someone who hasn't played a Fallout game before, or just wants a fun shooter to mess around with in an open world that likes picking up loot and or building stuff. I would still say if you want a really great Fallout game, go play Fallout New Vegas. In my opinion it's the best recent Fallout game to come out and gives you an idea of what an actual Fallout game is or was in a more nuanced way compared to the originals.",

            "review_text": "I believe I've played this game for long enough (about 250 hours or so) to have experienced pretty much everything it has to offer. I've also completed Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.  First off the graphics are fine - they're the least of this games problems. I'll also say that when Fallout 4 is good it's very good but I honestly can't give the game as a whole more than half marks because there are so many problems with it.  1. The settlement stuff is crap. I'm a lone wanderer, not a homesteader. Don't bother me with having to baby a bunch of strangers everywhere I go. 2. The new dialogue system is really awful. Because everything is scripted and voiced, you're severely restricted in terms of creating your own character, and it's extremely difficult/pointless to be bad or evil. Also, the choices are very limited - usually to 'yes', 'no', 'sarcasm' or 'tell me more'. Often though, there's really only one choice, and if you pick something else the options re-appear until you pick the 'right' choice to make the game progress the way it was going to anyway. 3. The leveling system is a huge step backward, and is designed in such a way as to make breaking the game much easier. For example I used to have to wait until I was very far into the game to take 'Ninja' in previous Fallout games. Now I can take it on level 1. Talking of which... 4. Giving the player access to power armour on level 1 and setting up a confrontation with a deathclaw almost immediately in a game like Fallout is such a blunder from a pacing and progression point of view that it boggles my mind. 5. The crafting system seems tacked on and feels very awkward. It also seems that they've used arbitrary crafting and level checks to balance an otherwise broken game. 6. The game becomes more and more tedious and samey as you progress. You're often sent back to the same locations two or three times to do different quests, and while some of the quests are interesting, the vast majority are 'go there and kill everything that moves'. 7. There is no hardcore mode. Survival mode just means you have to pump more bullets into each enemy and it takes longer for you to heal, but as the leveling system is broken it won't take long before you're flush with ammo and not worrying about healing much anyway. Especially if you use power armour a lot (which I didn't).  In short Fallout 4 is a decent but not great game with a lot of issues. It's really not progressed much at all in the four or so years since New Vegas (which I'd argue is the far superior game in almost every respect). It's much more of an FPS and less of an RPG than the previous games, which will please some (mostly players new to the franchise) and annoy others (a lot of people who love the previous Fallout games).  My advice is this: If you love the previous Fallout games then wait until Fallout 4 is heavily discounted. It's worth $30 or so imo.  I'm sure there will be more Fallout games in the future, but this latest has set a few precedents that don't bode well for upcoming Fallout games, so I think it'd be great if they handed the next one to Obsidian, who in my opinion did most things right with New Vegas. That's unlikely to happen though, so I'm not really looking forward to Fallout 5.",

            "review_text": "Fallout 4, yes, it's not really an RPG any more, Bethesda seem to be straying further and further away from their established roots as an effective RPG developer and striving to achieve a more streamlined, action orientated experience. If you take Fallout 4 as an evolution of this strive, rather than a sequel to the other Fallout games, then you'll find a hugely expansive and interesting open world action game, with some RPG elements.    The story is.. pretty poor in all honesty, with no clear direction and obvious motives aside from the initial 'Where is my son?!' arc, perhaps an interesting point to make is that you start the game before the bombs fall, giving you a sense of the world before it was rubble and dust and radioactive storms, the Commonwealth is noticeably bigger than Fallout 3’s Capital Wasteland, and this pre-war introduction add a new layer to the alternate 50’s retro/future vibe. Without spoiling it, the story runs out of steam around 25% in, and, as with all recent Bethesda titles, you can ignore the main story all together if you so wish. Side quests are a vast improvement on this though, with a good proportion of them being both interesting and rewarding, by now most people have heard all about the Preston Garvey “I’ve found another settlement” missions, but these are completely optional, and I found myself running away from Preston almost every time I travelled to the “Sanctuary” home base.  That brings me on to the base building, which is good but not quite good enough to last, Bethesda seem to never quite get objects to 'sit' right on the ground, meaning a lot of the place-able objects are floating a half inch off the ground, if you can get past his technical gripe, you can get fairly creative with your settlements, particularly with the recent DLC pack that has come out. However, be prepared to spend a hefty amount of time defending this settlements from raiders, super mutants, and the mutated animal population of the Commonwealth.  Combat in this game is massively improved over Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas, guns actually feel like they have power behind them, and with hundreds of different combinations thanks to the crafting system which I’ll talk about later, you can add real individuality to your style of play. Levelling up is much more streamlined than in previous titles, this can be a good or a bad thing depending on your feeling towards the older games in the series, I felt it helped keep the game from becoming a grind, most quests will offer a hefty chunk of XP for completing them, and, with the all new perks system you can pick and choose how you want to progress your character, whether it be specialising in big guns like rocket launchers or Fat Man launchers, or having a silver tongue and talking your way in and out of conflict.  As for factions, they are back this time around, unfortunately they all a bit rubbish. The Minutemen, The Railroad are both pretty poorly fleshed out, and the Minutemen in particular is almost thrust upon you at the beginning of the game with the aforementioned Preston Garvey, it takes a good while before you find The Railroad, although they do appear in the story for a fair chunk. Neither of the factions really offer any massive incentive to join them, which makes the Brotherhood of Steel the only real factions worth considering (Personally I always lean towards the Brotherhood, because Power Armour) and, whilst the factions ideals aren't really all that compelling, it at least adds gravity to an otherwise inconsequential plot.   The real fun is in the customisation of weapons and armour, by the end of my first play through I was level 32 and I'd barely scratched the surface of the expansive mods and skins you can apply to pretty much any bit of equipment in the game, from the paint of your power armour, to the type of stock of your laser rifle, its really impressive stuff and if you couple that with the cooking and med crafting in this game there is a lot of depth to each system.  Visually, the game looks impressive without blowing you away, I played the PC version of the game which was well optimised to run on the highest settings at 1080p, don’t expect to be wowed by the graphics in any way but for a late 2015 game they serviceable, Bethesda has never put graphics ahead of gameplay in their open world games so this was to be expected. Sound design is fantastic, the rocking 40’s/50’s radio stations are back and better than ever, and the weapons have real ‘oomph’ to them when you fire them, unfortunately the ambient soundtrack is pretty lacklustre, though if you have the radio on you will hardly hear it.   Overall this is a great game, not a great RPG, or a great Fallout game, but a great open world action/RPG experience, you can easily lose hundreds of hours in this game, and I think you should.",

As you can tell from my hour count, it failed to meet my expectations. The story was.....lackluster to say the least. I didn't feel engaged at all with the story, and the voiced protagonist threw it for me. With all of the other things to do, and that it even kinda forced at you, you forgot about SHAUN. GOTTA FIND SHAUN, because that's perfectly logical to do. Why not just forget about it? A lot of people did, and now FO4 is essentially settlement building simulator 2015. The dlc, aside from Far Harbor, has been boring and essentially useless to me. I would have much rather seen more story dlc, with new maps and engaging plot lines, like Old World Blues and Lonesome Road, along with The Pitt and a few other really good ones from FnV and Fo3. I don't care about these settlement building bits. Then they also gutted the Karma system. I know that some people really didn't like it, since it 'limited' them, or whatever, but it really allowed for a facet of Role Playing that just isn't present in Fo4. You can't be evil in this game, I know that you can be a d*ck, and slaughter whole cities, but you really don't get anything from that, no bounties, no consequences, no evil karma. You can kill half the town, and then come back a few days later and get a bowl of noodles without anyone saying anything. You can't do obviously evil quests, you can never get in good with the raiders, and you can't even say no to people sometimes. Just a sarcastic answer 'yes', mean answer 'yes', or two other basic 'yes' answers or maybe a question chain thrown in. You don't even know what your character is going to say, because it only gives you a single word prompt. Now, don't take my words as complete truth. I know that some people really liked the game, and played the hell out of it. I'm just saying that this game was boring to me.

You can't roleplay like in 1, 2, or NV. You are stuck in this role and you will like it.  Gameplay is a mixed bag. While the gunplay has gotten exponentially better, the gameplay itself feels sterile. There aren't any builds, there are no stats. You can level up and get every single perk you desire. They brought back Damage Resistance instead of Damage Threshold. The gun selection feels limited to pipe pistols or you grinding for slight modifications to some pre-existing weapons. I'm not going to pretend that New Vegas was some masterpiece when it came to gameplay, but it felt more consistent with everything that it did.  Writing in general is pretty oka-HATES NEWSPAPERS. This is bad too, there's a dialogue wheel from Mass Effect. Jesus why. There's no choice in this game. None. You say yes, or no* (no means yes). The characters seem fine, but they do seem very disconnected from everything.  And that's my biggest problem with this game, and Bethesda titles in general. Everything always feels disconnected. They were less awful about it with this game, but in general, Bethesda would rather make a bunch of different, isolated locations in their games, and not really have them connect well with other locations in the game. See Little Lamplight/Republic of Dave/etc. In a game where I want to be immersed in a world, Bethesda does everything in their power to make sure that you don't get that experience.

It is glitchy and very annoying at times. -Companions, there is some amazing companions you really get to know and love, such as Nick or Piper.

What?! Can't you have a better story then this?!?!  -Weapons, this is huge, in F3 and mostly in FNV there were like 40 base weapons and then you could find rare 'unique' weapons, this is small but I loved searching and finding for special weapons.  -AI... the AI has not changed at all, or VERY little, this feels like a Fallout 3 mod honestly. -Grphics, this is NOT next-gen graphics, this isn't a big deal if the game has good gamepley BUT, it feels like a Fallout 3 mod so they dont really have gameplay too much either.  -Lastly, At least on the PC, I have had hours and hours of manpower put in to try to fix this game, this game for me has so many problems, sometimes I cant play it sometimes I can.

The dialogue system has been dissected and is a shameful mess, most of the stories in the game are incoherent with one another. Companions never add anything meaningful to conversations and sometimes their presence should completely nullify entire dialogues but it never does leading to some very dumb moments. The two endings (out of what I assume is 3?) that I have done were the same, its like mass effect 3 all over again. I tried for a true good ending but it doesn't seem to exist.  Literally everything about the combat, exploration, looting, weapons modding, power armour, and graphics are all amazing. If you just want to go around shooting stuff and that then its good, but if you like decisions to matter and stats to help you get meaningful dialogue options (like I wanted) then this game is incredibly poor. I'd even go as far as to say it is appalling. :(  The building and settlements stuff is also utterly abysmal. Tacked on and pointless.  I'd give the game a 5/10. Its a fun FPS but this isn't the RPG that I expected from Fall out.",

Many of the RPG elements have been stripped away from the game to focus primarily on player ability rather than avatar creation. Which isnt necessarily a bad thing. It just ends up feeling like at this point fallout is much more an FPS with rpg elements than the other way around.  The story is forced on you more so than other games and it's pretty lack luster. Side quests are more fun but only marginally. There are only a few that stand out in my memory as most boil down to go to a place kill some (raiders/ghouls/mutants) and return.  Really it boils down to the same problems that were in Skyrim, there's a lot of potential but bland gameplay leaves the experience feeling overall unsatisfying.  Overall if you liked Skyrim you'll like fallout 4, however if you were on the fence on fallout 3 you likely wont.

There are tons of things to do in this game, I always find myself unable to stay focused on the main quests as I keep getting side tracked by other quests and/or explorating new areas. One of my favorite features of this game is been able to build your own house and manage your own settlements. For example you have to manage food supply, defences and electricity to keep the population of that settlement happy.   As for building your own house you have the choice of creating your own design or using one of the preset builds. So once you have built your 'dream home' your probably going to want to furnish it right? Well you can with huge variety of items. However this isn't handed to you on a plate, you have to go out and scavenge for materials to create your home and items for it. For example if you see an old telephone or a coffee cup think twice before you pass it off as just useless junk as it can be used for creating items.  The world of Fallout 4 is  HUGE  with a mass amount of locations to explore and characters to meet. Unlike a lot of others I don't have a problem with the dialogue, yes there are 'only' four options but in a lot of other games there are a similar options and it's not like you don't have a choice what you say. For example dialogue choice 1 will lead to another 4 dialogue options, where as say dialogue 2 is sarcasm will lead to a different 4 dialog options. The four options you get are not all the same in any way and can cause a conversation with a character to go one way or the other and sometimes saying the right things in a conversation get you out of trouble and make you avoid having to kill said character.  Overall for me (someone that has never played previous Fallout games) this is an all round decent game. I can see myself sinking a ridiculas amount of hours into this game just because of the sheer amount of things there is to do and places to explore. I would have more hours in this game but I did not purchase it on release date.  -Huge amount of places to explore, characters to meet, quests to complete and things to do -Excellent gunplay -Great visuals  A must have even if you have not played any other Fallout games",

So much is missing, and seems to have been replaced with gimmicky settlement stuff.  PROS: -Awesome gunplay, action mechanics such as VATS/chems/shooting feel real and satisfying. HUGE improvement from the predecessors, but that's to be expected.  -Contrary to what most people might say, graphics are great. Especially when you compare them to the previous games, New Vegas/F3.   CONS:  -Unbelievably boring/unlikeable factions.One of the major factions, the minutemen, LITERALLY has only like 2 notable characters, on top of that, the minutemen are the worst faction in Fallout history and contributes nothing interesting to the story. This is massive step back from New Vegas, which had very colorful and intruiging factions. Other than that, the game revolves around a conflict involving the Brotherhood of Steel, a faction we have seen since the orignal Fallout games, making this conflict extremely boring.  -Huge emphasis on settlements. Settlments were advertised as an optional thing, yet 80 percent of the game revolves around them. Hell, there is a major faction made specifically for the emphasis on settlements, the minutmen. I was initially excited for settlements, but I soon noticed that it's taken up a huge portion of the game, leading to the next point.  -Lack of intriguing side quests, most likely stemming from Bethesda's emphasis on settlements. From playing the game, its clear they made a huge trade off, they sacrificed potential for interesting quests/locations for more settlement locations, not acceptable in an ADVENTURE game. There are tons of repetitive radiant quests that Bethesda tried to use to fill the serious content gap, but it fails horribly.   -Dreadful dialogue changes (voiced protagonist, lack of player engagement, limited dialogue options, illusion of choice, unclear dialogue choices etc.)  I'm sure you've read it all before, in the other negative reviews. this is where the game just starts to slap fans of the older games in the face. Probably the worst decisions Bethesdsa has made, I still can't understand what they were thinking. Why give us so many options for customizing our characters appearance just to lock us all at ONE voice?   Probably 90 percent of the positive reviews for this game come from new Fallout players with no expectations or standards for the franchise, which is understandable, but frustrating. Fallout 3 has 7k steam reviews, this game has 60k+ after just a couple months! Those extra 53k reviewers probably have nothing to critique because they had no expectation(I have to be honest, I envy those people).   One might argue that comparisons with previous games are unnecessary, but this game was marketed as Fallout, I expect the FALLOUT I'm used to and a little more.   I play this game and feel as though the heart and soul of Fallout has been thoroughly removed, so disappointing seeing blunders like this come from the kings of RPG's, Bethesda. Seriously, where is the creativity from the last games? Nowadays all we get from Bethesda are streamlined features, overly-simpliefied dialogue, Minecraft/Pokemon-esque feaures/DLC, they're treating us like complete braindead morons.   If the game was called FALLOUT: SETLLEMENTS™ I wouldn't be so disappointed. As it stands, I feel insulted and deceived, I wouldn't have bought this game at full price, even if i were going to play for a billion hours.",

While the game, as a whole product, is not a bad game, I cannot reccomend it in good faith, especially to fans of other Bethesda games. While the graphics and mechanics are light-years beyond those of the previous Fallout games, they still feel antiquated for a big title game released in 2015. That being said, no one played Fallout for its stellar mechanics and graphics so I was willing to look past it as I did with the other two (which I have sunk well over 1000 hours in collectively.) The fact of the matter is, this game is so bland. Many if not most of the RPG elements have been removed and replaced with streamlined, simplified versions of themselves which leave something to be desired having been accustomed to the complexities of the old ones. For example, speech and persuasion in this game are almost completely arbitrary. Persuasion is now directly correlated to Charisma level and the speech skill (like every other skill) has been completely removed and replaced with miscellaneous perks. On top of that, almost all speech checks lead to more or less the same outcome and persuasion rarely has any purpose beyond making a little more money. The gun modding system is cool, I definately am a big fan of the addition. Being able to customize guns to better fit one's play style is great. But, like almost every system in the game, it is simplified beyond reason. There are very few base weapons in the game and then those can be adapted to nearly anything, thus eliminating many of the 'Woah' moments when someone finds a really cool/unique weapon. A laser pistol can be modded into some sort of super, fully automatic laser sniper rifle, which for me at least, makes 99% of the weapons I find while exploring not even worth picking up. The settlement system, in principle, is a really cool new addition, but it occupies far too many of the locations on the map, making it impossible to really invest in the mechanic. Not to mention that the settlement budget is too small, the navmesh/general functionality of settlements is utterly broken, and the actual mechanics behind building them are infuriating. What I've heard from a lot of people who defend this game is that that all of the new features and visual/mechanical updates are the result of a trade-off, thus some of the complexities of the older games had to suffer. I take issue with this which really brings me to my main problem with this game. I don't know how long this game was in development, but there had to have been at least five solid years put into it. This game was not so vast and new that they had to axe all RPG elements, the graphics and mechanics are not even close to earth-shattering. Bethesda did not even have the burden of creating a brand new engine! The resources were all there, but the end product plays hollow, gimmicky and otherwise unfinished. It feels like a waste of time, right down to it's core; just another bland fps that would only have been state-of-the-art in 2008. By no means a terrible game, just a huge dissapointment from a franchise I've always loved.",

            "review_text": "I love you Bethesda but you can't be doing that. **A relatively good game but I can't bring myself to call it a great game.   Pros: Moddable Decent story. (decent at best) Fun gameplay (when you're not crashing or freezing) Combat is fun, if you don't run into the bug that causes your game to freeze in VATS (which, ironically, I only started encountering after they issued an update to fix this problem) Settlement mode is kinda fun when you get the hang of it, though it's still buggy and very touchy. I would recommend a mod that allows you to *slightly* place an item within another item's area (which helps circumvent the bugginess. Who cares if I want a couch to be placed less than 5 inches from a stand/table?)  Cons: BUGGY AS ALL HELL. I know what to expect from Bethesda in general, what with the extremely open environments and choice system, but a game-ending crash-to-desktop bug caused me to restart my 40-hour game from scratch -- and I STILL ended up catching the same CTD. At least I found a workaround (a walkaround, technically, that took an extra 5 minutes), but it basically rendered 1 settlement unusable and was a real pain-in-the-♥♥♥. In some other cases, quest events fail to trigger and either bug out the quest or force you to use console commands to skip forward--which is at least immersion-breaking. Also, VATS seemed to cause a game freeze 66% of the time, requiring an Alt+F4 quit)  Conversations are repetitive. Instead of a few different options, you're set up with basically the exact same conversational setup throughout the game ('More info,' 'Snarky,' 'No,' 'Nice')  Diplomacy is a thing of the past--Charisma has been nerfed, and peaceful routes are almost eliminated.  That being said, it was very cool in PREVIOUS games that your skills/stats could open particular conversation routes (e.g. high intelligence could allow you to comprehend certain jargon and discuss things in quests and general conversation that an idiot melee character couldn't fathom). This feature is gone.  Some NPC's are extremely annoying. I know there are annoying people in the world, but you'd think they could remember that they *just* held you up to give you the same spiel 5 minutes ago.  The good/evil reputation system was completely removed. This was actually kind of awesome that your treatment (or slaughter) of random people would be talked about and people would treat you accordingly. Now it's like GTA -- where the hot dog guy will watch you murder 25 cops and then condescendingly sell you a hot dog.  Almost zero challenge. Even on Survival mode, it's not likely that you will die much.  There's a particular fortified settlement that will always respawn its defenses even if you clear everything out. You'd think that you should be able to take control of such a settlement.  Lastly, if this bugs you -- the game has been in development for years, and so has graphics akin to New Vegas, the previous installment.  TL;DR Bethesda has wiped out really cool features of their previous game, probably to appeal to more casual players. They supposedly improved combat, but the combat bugs have cancelled out any improvements and make it more frustrating than anything. Also, this is the buggiest, Crash-To-Desktopiest game I've ever played.",

I would recommend this game to anyone looking for an Adventure-FPS similar to Far Cry: post-apocalyptic Boston looks beautiful in Fo4, the map is pretty big and there's lots to explore, and of course the mods are pretty much what makes me continue to play; HOWEVER, Bethesda let down all the RPG gamers by stripping the roleplaying game elements that made Fallout games so awesome and replacing them with mainstream mediocrity by dumbing them down.  In previous Fallout installments, various quest progressions and dialogue choices were unlocked if you're character passed skill checks. In Fo3, in the middle of the city Megaton is a huge, undetonated pre-war bomb. The sheriff asks you to disarm it and if you meet the Explosives skill check you can if you want to. Or I could detonate it. Or I could use my Repair skill to offer to fix a radio for a local store owner for some caps. Now there is no more skill checks and no more uniqueness to your characters. Skills are fully replaced with perks, which is all fine and dandy except besides the benefit your perks give you it doesn't affect the game in any other way. Now there is no noticeable difference in story progression and ROLEPLAYING choices if you're a Hulk with 10 Strength who lives to smash your enemies skulls in with sledgehammers or you're the next Nicola Tesla who evaporates your enemies with energy weapons before they're even aware you're in the room.  Speaking of dialogue choices and skill checks, they totally dumbed down the dialogue mechanic as well. Instead of having unique conversations depending on how you chose to roleplay your character, you're now restricted to only four dull options: Yes, No, Repeat what you said, and Sarcastic Yes. What happened to being a prick and telling people off! There's no more telling a general you want to kill them so much, or telling a kid your face looks like my butt, it's just bland dialogue and it's mind-numbing and makes the story feel like it's dragging on.  Another disappointment is the lack of moral choices Fo4 offers. Sure there are some small choices like making a mom pay a drug dealer for the son's jet he got hooked on or to defend the family from the drug dealers, but that's nothing compared to blowing up an innocent town and obliterating hundreds of innocent people, effectively removing a whole town because someone offered you a nice house or even because you just wanted to be evil for funsies. Or in Fo:NV, the starting town you can defend the citizens from raiders, OR! you can meet with the leader and agree to help take over and have a battle royale with the people who helped you on your feet! That's messed up! And I miss being messed up. Even the main story lacks dramatic moral choices: it pretty much consists of what faction you join, and all the factions are morally gray anyways so it's more of what ideology you align with.  6.0/10. All in all, Fallout 4 is a good FPS adventure game: vast open world, alright gun and settlement mechanics, but it really sucks that Bethesda took one of the greatest RPGS and stripped a lot of the roleplay aspect out of it. Skills don't play an active role in the story, lack of dialogue options, and lack of opportunities to act morally reprehensible strip Fallout of any meaningful roleplaying elements. Roleplay is was what made Fallout, Fallout.",

TL;DR: Fallout 4 is a decent open world FPS, but a terrible RPG and a bad sequel to either FO3 or FO:NV. It has very little player agency, poor illusion of choice, slightly disappointing DLC, a disgustingly lazy ending, a pile of crafting systems that didn’t quite satisfy, lazy to outright bad procedurally generated content, a lot of locations that feel more hollow than previous editions, but a few really memorable moments (if fewer than I expected), an interesting central theme that gets decent exploration, some great premises for locations, quests, NPCs, and the PC that aren’t explored as well as they should have been, and much improved combat. Even with all its flaws it was a fun for a good long while, but it spoiled a lot of its goodwill by leaving on a very sour note, twice. It’s not a very good RPG, and while it’s also not an outstanding FPS sandbox, it’s certainly not bad either. Given as how I buy Fallout games as RPGs, picking up the base game 2/3 cost or the Season Pass at 1/2 or less isn't bad value.   Positives * Much improved gunplay.

Being a pre-war survivor had amazing potential for illuminating the prewar world mindset and adding context to the stories, even if it was mostly squandered by the abortion of the dialog system strangling roleplaying, it was still a great idea. * The synth slavery theme. Are artificial sapients property or slaves? Lots of good moral quandary there. * A few standout companions. Piper, Curie, Nick, Danse, and Ada were all novel and interesting. * A few truly memorable locations/quests exist, such as the Salem museum and the Cabot House, but nowhere near as many as in previous games. * Gun/armor modding/crafting is initially exciting but is too shallow, becoming hum-drum long before you finish. There just isn't enough headroom in the crafting system for it to stay interesting. * Running with Liberty Prime was badass in FO3 and is still fun, if considerably less so, a second time. * Far Harbor was fun with a few interesting characters such as the Mariner and DiMa and even a tower defense minigame! Surprisingly it also had a vault with a nice twist and great ambiance. * With all DLC you can build settlements that don’t look like complete trash, actually look lived in. * The settlement building was very fun for a short while, but got old fast. The controls for linking parts are very finicky/buggy, and nothing is properly explained. No mechanic this complex should have so little tutorial. * The ruins of Boston make an interesting place to explore, but seem less full of 'ghost stories' than previous games. By that I mean notes/holotapes detailing stories of people who died that give you color for locations. They feel much less verbose and numerous than previous fallout games. * DLC are a major mixed bag. Far Harbor was overall good, but felt far too shallow/short for the price, and made my frame rate sad. Calling the quests of Nuka World spartan would be overselling it, especially if you aren't planning to go all-in as a raider. It’s an interesting location idea, but a lot of it feels empty and less than interactive. The robot companions and quests of Automation were fun, but the quest line was basically 'blink and you missed it.' The rest of the DLC were like the work of amateur modders that you would normally download for free, and probably would already have done so if Bethesda had the released the mod tools yet.  Negatives * Radiant quests are universally garbage, and some (like the Minuteman ones) are forced upon you. Most quests boil down to 'Go here, kill everything, come back' or 'Go here, pick up mcGuffin, come back.' Neither have any charm or subtlety. * Preston Garvey: the companion that vomits unfun side quests onto you whenever you are within a mile or so. Also he has virtually no personality. * Perks are very poorly balanced and are kept behind level gates. Want to be a master lock pick in early levels to get behind all the doors you are seeing while exploring. Well you can’t. Expect to backtrack if you want to fully explore. It’s drudgery. * Loot is almost entirely randomized, boring junk, and even the “legendary” prefixes get boring after the fourth time you’ve seen a particular one. Also, really dumb combinations like the Ghoulslayer’s Radiation Emitter, which does extra damage against ghouls on a gun that does radiation damage that they are immune to. Pre-modded weapons scavenged from raiders and most crafting skills are redundant when you can simply buy weapons with the mods you want from shopkeepers. * The dialog cross design paradigm is hot garbage. Most of the conversation branches don't matter for longer than 2 sentences before the conversation snaps back on the rails. A lot of the one word summaries are misleading. * The illusion of choice was euthanized. You will know your role or the game will forcibly remind you of it. You are a grieving husband searching for his son. That is your only approved motivation. * No skill challenges due to skills being eliminated. Few perks matter in conversation.  * The story goes to ♥♥♥♥ for a good character in the third act when every faction becomes genocidal. I didn't feel like picking a team because they were all literally advocating genocide.  * For the whole main game you couldn't really play an evil/selfish character, only mildly peevish. In the final DLC, you can't really play a non-evil character without basically skipping, at a minimum 1/3 of the quests.  * The endings are hot garbage only slightly better than Mass Effect 3. Choose your faction then slaughter all the other factions by nuking them. Want a pacifist run? Too bad. Want to broker a compromise/diplomatic solution? Too bad. Want to use subterfuge? Too bad. Want to make ANY change to any faction despite being told you have high rank? TOO DAMN BAD! Here's your nuke, now get with the fetch quests! Ending slideshow only considers the outcome of one general plot point and your gender. Otherwise it’s cut and paste.  * Lack of plot branches and the ability to juggle all the factions until nearly the last second means that the game has very little replay value. Saving before the point of no return might net you another 6 hours, tops, for very little reward, as the differences are largely minor. * The big plot twist is kinda obvious as early as 10 minutes into the game and lacks much emotional punch due to poor engagement with prelude NPCs and limited dialog options. Really the prelude needed to be at least 3x longer to build up more attachment to the PC’s family. * I liked the original flavor dickish FO4 BoS less than the milder, more heroic FO3 BoS, but YMMV. * Many super mutants sound like a frat boy’s impression of an evil Cookie Monster. YMMV * I'm personally not fond of power cores design feature. I’m just not fond of my clothes having ammo. YMMV. * Institute ending says you are Director (essentially dictator) but then gives you absolutely no agency to change anything and sends you on fetch quests as radiants.",

            "review_text": "Overall, I have to nope this one as a disappointment. As one reviewer said, it's a good game, but it's a bad fallout game. Wait till it's on sale.  The dialogue system is terrible, and the voice acting forces you into one type of character.   UI on pc needs work. Who thought it was a good idea to put grenade, bash and scope zoom on the same key?   Between settlements and the new crafting system, I feel like I'm playing minecraft, not Fallout.  Radiant quests really kill the single player feel, and make this feel like a mmorg. The settlement radiant quests are really annoying.   Crafting turns this game into an episode of American/Canadian Pickers and Pawn Stars.   Removal of skills and the new perk system kill the RP aspect of this game. Combined with no level cap takes away any need to strategize your character build and put some thought into who you are. Overall it's TOO generic.  The writing and story organization and progression are terrible. It took me 5 minutes in game to loose all concern over the main story, and I never got it back at any point. Scaving for aluminum and glue, and babysitting useless settlers were the main game focus. I was hoping DLC's would add much needed story content but...  exacly one and a half dlc's have story content. The rest are just workshop addons that should have been added in the first place. It felt a bit like a pay to win mmorg without the win. Really, Obsidian should have handled the DLC's.   No more Karma means there are no more consequenses for your actions. I miss having to weigh my descions and live with the consequenses. In this game there are no consequenses. Even dialoigue all lead to the same results. The only exception is with companions.   Overall, this game felt dumbed down to a 12 year olds level, it comes across as lazy, with a lack of effort at things that do make big differences. Have a look at the complexity behind Morrowind, faction, race and affilliation all had an effect on your relations with the world, relations with npcs (who were ALL named) were also complex. Fallout has lost all of that complexity.   It looks nice though, and the combat itself is good. Far Harbor is ok so far, and Atomitron was good, but short. The rest of the DLC's are a waste of time and money. Personally I could care less about the workshop or building contraptions. They don't make up for the poor writing, and don't come close to the quality of the DLC's in FNV.  Final tally, at $79 canadian, plus $69.99 for the season pass, this game was a complete over-hyped rippoff.",

            "review_text": "I don't use any mods in my games because I want to play the games as originally sold so my experience here may be better or worse than others. I played Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas for a couple hundred hours and this is definately not the caliber of either of those.   There is less of a storyline, less singular exiting side quests, less interesting adventure than the previous Fallout games. And certainly less roleplay. How I loved coming across an unexplored area where it would begin some crazy new set of quests or missions that were always different. In Fallout 4 almost all missions are the same killing raiders or zombies. After a short while it becomes repetitious and boring.   You can settlement building is a really cool option. I would just say that when you have about 10 settlements that can be a bit overwhelming at times espeically when happiness starts dropping at multiple locations and then they get attacked. I have noticed settlements always seem to get more people than beds?? Not sure why that is. I have 10 settlements with trade routes set up and I can't even tell if anyone is actually doing any trading? But I'm not running out of money but that could be due to the items I'm always selling or scrapping so I don't need much. Placing buildings can be ridiculous sometimes because the game won't let you put them where you know they should or could go.The capability to build items lacks a lot of variety but I supose that could be due to there isn't much available after a nuke goes off otherwise for me it's ok.    What happened to the KARMA?!?!? The decisions you made good or bad always had repercusssions in previous Fallout games. In this one you can pretty much do what you want, kill who you want and there's no negative affect??  No more character traits?? Everything is a perk and everything is positive. before you had to really look at what perk you picked because there was always an upside and a downside affect with each one. Now it doesn't matter what you pick there's no negative affect.  Dialogue---UGH!!! The choices are mostly one word pick a,b,c,d, responses with either a friendly, sarcastic or talk more response. All unemotional automaton and it doesn't matter which answer you pick becuse there's no karma so really no impact of your choice.   Overall this is an ok game if you're just starting with this one but certainly not for full price. If there's a Steam Sale for 40-50% then its priced right but you'd still have all the same issues at any price.   ",

The combat system has drastically improved and crafting has been refined into a balanced and enjoyable part of gameplay, two things that the original Bethesda iterations suffered from. Unfortunately, in doing so they failed to create a unique world with an interesting plot. Though the graphics and gameplay were not the best in Three and New Vegas, both told complex stories that delved into the depths of human nature while retaining a dark sense of humor. The Commonwealth is prettier than the Capital Wasteland and the Mojave but this does not excuse the poorly designed characters that fail to have anywhere near the same depth or complexity as the ones in Three and New Vegas.   The story attempts to continue the bleak commentary on the human condition through the struggle of the synths, but the game provides nothing new to a concept that has already been so thoroughly explored. The Roleplaying experience has been dismantled by the new dialogue system which provides significantly less complexity complexity compared to the other Fallouts and by the main character’s son: Shaun. The player has no where near the same level of control over the dialogue options surrounding Shaun and he ends up acting as a proverbial ball and chain as the player can do nothing to change his character’s opinion about the matter. In the end the Sole Survivor is essentially Liam Neeson in Taken, though significantly less badass and with as much personality of a cardboard cutout.  The DLC proves to be even a sloppy attempt to garner money from it’s players; quick cash grabs with barely any flesh. In past Fallout games the DLC has contained a host of new characters, weapons, gameplay, and stories that were both fun and thought provoking. In New Vegas, the DLC adds so much depth to the story that the DLC’s nearly become the main plot itself. Fallout Four’s DLC on the other hand for the most part contain short and poorly written stories that are mainly just there to add a few new items to the settlement crafting system and almost nothing else. Far Harbor contains a decently interesting plot with more complex characters and fun equipment, but is still shorter than the other Fallout DLCs. Far Harbor is the only one really worth any money as Bethesda clearly slacked on adding any real depth to the rest of them.  Overall, Fallout Four is still fun at times. The combat system and crafting make for some enjoyable gameplay and the game is still littered with little Bethesda easter eggs and encounters. Despite this, it’s poorly written story and characters take away from what could have been a much more complex and compelling experience. Buy it if it’s on sale and you’re looking for a time killer but you would be better off getting Fallout Three or New Vegas.",

The aspects of roleplaying that Bethesda left out in favour of combat really bugged me and i just didn't like having no reputation with factions (and don't get me started on the dialouge options). Sure i may have at least 70 hours on it, but thats mostly from trying to force myself away from the main storyline, which frankly i couldn't give less of a damn about. (That opinion probably changes depending on if you have a child or not heh) So main of my play time was spent looking around the wasteland, which i liked, sure. But when i finally started getting into the main story, i felt like i was dragging myself along just because the game prompted me to go that way, do that thing, kill that thing, etc etc. So in my honest opinion, even though i liked the smooth combat, the game kind of lost its steam with me at around the 60 hour mark. So i wouldn't recommend as i feel it's kind of a dissapointing fallout. btw pls no raep this is just a doods opinion, if you like the game then i'm happy you have decently large game to take up hours of your life.

My overall rating would be a 7/10  Please note my review will be updated as dlc is added to the game hopefully bethesda will listen to their fans and improve on many of the faults.  Also i am not saying this is a bad game its just not the type of game fallout fans expected.",

            "review_text": "Okay here it is. I took forever to post my review but here it is. Not that anyone really gives a crap if I, Chicago-Ted, post one. There are more experianced and popular reviewers out there. This is the first game I added gray area bits, aswell, meaning ones that are both pros and cons. Ok, here we go...  PROS  -Gunplay. A good improvement over the last games, Fallout 4's gunplay is a giant leap for Fallout games. It shows just how much combat adds to immersion. That being said, stealth is horrible in this game. Read about that under cons.  -Weapons custimization. Wow. Just wow. This game adds a whole bunch of options for weapons. New barrels, grips, recievers, and muzzles. Besides the basic custimizables, the crafting menu also lets you rename weapons, something I have wanted since the first fallout. Armor can also be custimized just as much. Go, Bethesda, go.  -Pipboy. Yes, the Pipboy is better than ever, making the player really feel like they are equiped with a real alternate reality PDA. This is the first Bethesda brand Fallout game I didn't crave a new Pipboy skin.  -Robots. They just look and feel way better. They also redid the Mister Gutsy voice, which is amazing. All robots will start to fall apart while you shoot them, making it feel very realistic. Who wouldn't want to tear a Sentry Bot apart with a minigun?  -Scavenging. To be honest, I didn't think this would be a pro at first, I thought that it would be way to overloading. Instead of bogging the player down, forcing them to seek out very specific items, the player can find a variaty of items they can scrap for the same parts.  -Voice acting. Not to be confused with the Player's voice that is. Characters feel much more diverse and better actd. They sound like real people, not just clones and robots (even though some are robots). Preston Garvey really sells his part well, not to mention piping-hot Piper.  GRAY AREAS  -Player voice. It make's the game feel alot more imersive, yes, but what about the player choosing who their character is? I like my first playthrough being Goodguy Gary, but after that it feels repeditive. I've logged over 800 hours into New Vegas because of its outstanding ability to be anyone you want. But now? Pffft, good luck being an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or a creepy cannibal. No dark secrets, just the one-dimensional good guy of the wasteland. The good side of it is that conversations fell much more alive, giving the npc something to really react to. It's great that conversations don't need to be decoded like in books. Tone, intention, sarcasm, and humour can easily be detected.  -Weapon's look and feel. They all look pretty good, except for the pipe-pistols. The 10mm looks brand spanking new, and even the super-sledge looks interesting, but thats not the point. For once, Fallout had a good standard for what the weapons looked like and felt, but now they are completely different. Yes, that's why this isn't a pro, it's because they changed their look. I know, I know. You think that's a stupid statement and that I'm afraid of change. But tell me this, why would the same brand of weapons be the exact same in Washington DC and Nevada? Well, maybe Boston has a diffrent weapons manufacturer. Maybe, but for the 10mm, minigun, assualt rifle, combat armor, gatling lazer, and power-fist? Maybe I'm overthinking it, but honestly I really wish it wasn't changed. I know I'm not the only one either.  -Power armor. Power armor is so fun to run around in, custimize, and punch with. I'll admit, my favorite part of this game was walking underwater in power armor. However, it is also fragile and is massively underpowered. Requiring fuel is fine, but it needs to be WORTH the fuel, and honestly it isn't. Pieces will break often, reqiuring precious pecies of junk to fix. Exploring the wastes in it will waste the fuel, and exploring without it could lead to a moment where you would beg to have some sweet exoskelular action. It's just too complicated.  -Deathclaws. They are amazing in this game, they run around like you think they should, zigzaging against your hail of 5mm rounds, picking up and slamming power armored goons into the ground, and even a cute little horor scene up in Salem (my aunt and uncle live in salem!). But unfortunately, these beauties are very limited. With very few scripted quest s/events that they take place in, it really bums me out.  -Wasteland. Yes, the map. It has so much variety yet it's all bland at the same time. It can be split into three parts, Glowing Sea, City, and Grass. Even Fenway park felt a little underwhelming. I grew up in Weymouth (a town close to Boston) and it doesn't feel anything like it did in real life. I wanted to feel tingles walking past streets I've walked past just all blown up and stuff. But it didn't feel anything like that. Fenway park could easily be swapped out for any other stadium, it really looks that generic. Fort Independence gave me tingles though, having visited the area myself a few times, the general shape of the are felt ok-ish. But that's it, ok-ish. While I know not everyone lives here, obviously, but it just doesn't look right at all. New Vegas had Hoover damn, the dry lakes, and the Vegas sign. Fallout 3 had all of the famous landmarks you could want, with the Washington monument, Capital building, and Lincon memorial. But Boston? Where's the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ run-down subway system? Where's the wierd, poorly planned-out, streets? It's all just meggle-shmeg.  CONS  -Story. Come on, seriously? It's all ♥♥♥♥ once you get into the Institute. I won't spoil it, but it isn't good. It doesn't catch well. Time passes wierdly and not logically at all. Compare two character's ages together and it doesn't make sense. I'm not going to rant about this because people will just comment saying 'thanks for ruining the story, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!'. Don't worry I've already yelled into my skype call and let all of my anger towards it out with my good friend Wheat Swegnar.  -Choices. You don't get alot in this game. You can't really politely turn down being the lord of a faction. It really comes down to good guy and uninvolved guy. Not like in Fallout New Vegas and 3.  -Quest variety. There just isn't alot of it. Go kill raiders, fetch me some components, save a kidnapped girl, it's all the same past these few categories. Sure, there are some cool unique ones like the Salem one or popping the big blimp but it's usually the same stuff.  -Weapons variety. Holy ♥♥♥♥, look at all these pipe weapons! Early game you get a pipe pistol or a 10mm. That's it, really. Comparing this game to every other Fallout isn't fair. This one just has too few shooty-bangs.  -Modding. Bethesda's devs stated 'people don't care about mods if the game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥!'. Well thats all good and swell but a game will always be ♥♥♥♥♥♥ towards specific groups. So, for the people (and there's alot of them) who hate most of the features in this game, where do they get their excitement? For me modding the old Fallouts is a game all in itself, giving me loads of hours to mess around in the GECK with new houses and weapons. But does Bethesda release the GECK right away? No no no. Of course it's understandable that they have a load of things on their plate but for me and many others, this is a travesty. Too many features are for a specific crowd and all the others get left out. I don't want to be a whiny little tart, but we really need our mod tools.  -Bugs. My game was filled with CTD's, quest bugs, and more. Bethesda said it wanted to realease a good game before it gave us mod tools, but I believe they just don't care about PC gamers anymore, which is stupid seing as we were the pedestal that held the Fallout games for so long and the fact that we are going to be making the PS4 and Xbox One's modds (oh yeah that's right those guys get to suckle on our ♥♥♥♥ for mods). This game is so damn buggy it's crazy.  TLDR, buy it on console if you like Call of Duty and casual games.",

It's rumored that the original Fallout was intended to be a punishing and ultimately unwinnable game, a hard lesson about humanity's inevitable self destruction. The game wound up having some positive endings but its tone is still dark, brutal and sad.  Bethesda's Fallout revival has been brighter, at least a tiny bit, but the games are still pretty stark. Even as an armed survivor in Fallout's wasteland, you're constantly asked to make tough decisions, knowing that each of the options offered will cause suffering to someone. Crazed NPCs attack you for no reason forcing you to end their lives, your companions die meaninglessly, and every person you interact with is one tiny mistake away from the abyss.  Fallout 4 may be the finest installment in this series. As soon as you run it the screen turns black and the game crashes. After a few seconds you're returned to the desktop sadder, but also wiser. For you there is no escaping into a virtual world, not even a harsh one. Your life is just as you left it. Nothing is fixed, nothing is solved.

It's not the graphics. The graphics are amazing. Nor is it the gameplay, which is also a vast improvement compared to Fallout 3 or even New Vegas.  The game just feels . . . empty. I don't know if I can adequately explain it. All I can say is that, while there may be a lot of content and many quests, they just didn't really grip me as much as they ought to. The main questline is also weak, which definitely doesn't hurt but which isn't the main problem due to the vast number of side quests available.  Maybe it's the fact that this game just feels so similar to Fallout 3. While the game is based in an entirely different area (Boston), many areas just feel like remodeled and retextured areas from the previous Fallout games. Different in look and design, sure, but the same in feel.  Also, I should warn anyone that this game is very resource-demanding. You need a very powerful GPU and CPU to be able to play this game in consistent 60fps or above. Even then you may have to suffer occasional stuttering. This definitely didn't help its case at all.  Disclaimer: I haven't played the DLCs. I don't know if they improve the game at all, add something more worthwhile. As it is, all I can say is that unless you're a hardcore Fallout game who doesn't get bored with games no matter how repetitive, Fallout 4 is probably not for you.",

            "review_text": "Guys, I'll be short. I played all fallout games, started in 1998. I have never finished a single game though as I loose interest after several weeks of gaming to any game. That game was the most promising... and it failed. There is not a single positive moment for me at the moment, as all pros are either ruined or not tuned up.   Now, first of all. It's bugs. And I don't talk about quest related bugs. But bodies disapperaing after sniper kill? Making a sniper kill, receiving XP and then look as the raider just runds around, looking for you? Enemies spawning just from the air like in the cheapest shooter or CoD series??? My favourite one is to clear the floor and when game gives you a notice that you are spotted by the enemies on a lower level. That's ok, but I swept that floor before! You can tell me to wait for patches, but really, why are we in OBT? You are not WB to make use of your fans and the price for the game is quite high. I am sorry but I am from that kind of old schoolers who belieives a game should have no more than three patches.  Disappearing villagers, problems with constructions, not giving instructions on how build (farms are the most initial problem for everyone). Can't see your peepboy as stealth is activated - you problems and only yours.  Dialogue System. I want to find the person who introduced this sytem in this game and look into his eyes. Is it a cost reduction for actual dialogues? Or F4 is a console exclusive? Even if it is, I doubt RPG fans will like the system of dialogues, where they can make no choice.  New Vegas and Skyrim had a decent dialogue system, why the hell you changed it? Why you make us suffer? Most of the times you make a blind choice, hoping this is the choice you want to make. Ok, game is made for consoles. But even Mass Effect series and Alpha Protocol with same system has a much better understanding of what's going on. Sometimes I can't understand now if I am going to persuade a person or threaten him. No skill based choices, no attribute based choices. Only charisma and luck (because even yellow colored options have a chance of not working)  Companions. At the moment I have only Dog and Codsworth. The person, responsible for their IA is the second one I want to meet. Whose the brighest idea it is to ruin evrything from Skyrim and F3 series? Not tactics, no weapon mode, no keeping distance. I am annoyed of ruining sneaks by that damned robot. And it freaks me out each time he close my sight right before making a sniper shot. I am sorry, guys, but I want a game. An RBG + action. Not a tactical strategy with moving my partner other the map. Their AI ruins everything for me. And why I am not receiving XP for their kills?   Update. Just took Prenston as companion. What the hell? I can't change his equipment and weapons? I understand, that they are immortals, but that is not the reason for them receive damage in full! Godsworth can't crunch or hide himself, ruining all the stealth, Prenston always wonders away from the me, making it impossible to find him. No wonder you have skills to play all alone now.  Combat system. It is good that raiders can use covers now, quite a fresh experience. And that you can play a sort of Splinter Cell from time to time. But what the hell with the movement? Sometimes I feel like they are boosted or something. In F3 series and Skyrim everything was natural, what went wrong here?   PERKS system is quite good, though borrowed from Skyrim. But there are accuracy perks? I found only strenth perks for hip-fire accuracy. And then you have crafting perks, stating you won't be able to craft without them. But you actually can and for basic weapons parts the number of choices is quite amazing. Now, SKILLS - that part I miss and I can't say perks replace them completely. The good staff is that you are not at disadvantage between choosing two good perks now.  TIPS - this game has the worst tips ever. They appear as a short notice, usually with our notices you don't care about and dissapear the same way. No trace later, at least I haven't found one. Fortunately, Fallout has a strong community to help. The game itself is not friendly in sorts of giving directions.  Quests. Why the quest designer didn't work on par with map designer? The first Minutemen mission send you to a far farm, though you have a good one with the same quest just nearby. It also seems, that FEDEX and Kill em all quests are made on xerox.  Where are all other cons, starting from game not being optimized. It is the first time I bought the game on launch event and the first time I deeply regret it. I even considering to ask for refund and return to F: NV and Skyrim. Seems that all games Bethesda makes with number 4 in name are doomed to fail. Looking forward for F5  The only great thing in the game is radio. That staff is really great, though seems a shorter version of F3 versions.",

Even though this Fallout is full of stuff it can still get boring. Other than a few fun interactions with companions and npc's it's not nearly as fun as the two before it. it is a pretty big injustice to compare this game to any other Fallout game really because it doesn't feel anything like a fallout game to begin with, I put 400+ hours on both FO3 and New Vegas before i stopped playing them, i've only been playing this game for aprox 80 hours and I started to lose interest after about 50hrs until i decided to add mods for a comparison.

And I say 'HAD' to mod in, because hunting down armor with random attributes drives me completly nutting bonkers, and is why I don't play MMORPGs.   It's beginning to feel like Bethesda doesn't publish finished games because they know the modding community will patch up the holes of whatever sinking ship that they publish  As far as a Bethesda open world game goes, this thing feels clangy and incomplete. I feel like I bought a drier with only half of the working parts, and while I can get those other working parts for free, it's tedium to hunt down the specific aesthetic mods I like, and painful to install the ones that makes the game function like a proper game. Worst of all, it's ankle-deep. Once you finish the story and the handful of sidequests and faction quests, you might as well start a new character because there's no reason to carry on unless for some reason you really like hearing Preston saying the same handful of lines over and over.  So do I recommend this? No. I recommend that you replay New Vegas with some graphical enhancements installed instead.  Tl;dr Crooked Salesmutants ruining Fallout. QQ.",

I myself ran into dozens of bugs and had to restart quest's several times. There's also all kinds of things floating in this game, everything from bears to robots. Falling cars and things dropping from the sky just like skyrim. Bethesda games are well known for their problems and it seems they didn't fix any of them in this one.  Does it run better than their past games No. People are still complaining about certain areas of the game dropping their frame rate, and people are still having crashing to desktop problems, because of graphics. Even after the so called patch from Bethesda people are still having problems.   Did they add more voice actors, not really, the entire game is just like skyrim only has a handful of voice actors, and half of them are terrible. And they have limited script the NPC's say the same things over and over. And in many cases they don't even remember who you are. Voice actors costs money, so they hire one or two good ones for the main parts, and then crap out on the rest.  Are there better graphics no, they are bland and washed out something even the paid reviews mentioned. There more colorful but still bland and washed out.   Did they make the game more of an immersive role playing game. No, In fact it's not a RPG at all, they took it all out. Now it's a poor man's 1st person shooter. There is no good or evil you can't change the outcome of anything by your decisions. The reason for this was to save money, they would've had to write multiple path dialogue the way they did it cuts all that out. The only role playing you will do is in your own mind because your path has already been selected in this game.  Did they fix the Ai! Absolutely not, dumb as ever. Now what excuse could there be for not fixing the Ai? It's called Xbox that's the reason, it takes programming which cost money and a CPU to process. Bethesda made this game for the console not the PC.  Has anyone noticed that half of the stuff in this game they stole from mod makers that worked on skyrim. I'm not the only one to mention this there's a discussion at nexus about it. This wouldn't be the first time they were accused of that either.  Has the size of the explore area increased, Boston may look crowded with buildings but you can actually go in only a handful of selected places. Everything else is boarded up. Even Angry Joe and his youtube review mentioned that.   Also keep in mind that Bethesda has never ever completely patched and fixed their games. They only deal with playability and that's about it. Any one that played skyrim or any of their other games knows is this.   Why is this acceptable? Why do we end up having to rely on community made patches? When Bethesda who is making hundreds of millions of dollars doesn't do it.  There's many more things I could mention but let's get on to the why? Bethesda is part of a multi conglomerate corporation that makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year. So why can't they spend any of that money in making a decent complete game that the fans of the franchise want?  Now think about this?   Look at the volume of Mods that were created for skyrim for free, by nonprofessionals.  Some of these Mods included entire different lands, quest that take several hours to finish. Look at all the community made patches, original textures, animations, I mean the list is endless, tens of thousands of Mods.   In the same length of time Bethesda has been working on this game, 'is the best they could produce'? These are supposed to be professional game designers working at a job. You've got to be kidding right! Think about it people! This is as good as they can get? Something is wrong with this picture! They make hundreds of millions of dollars from their games, they have dozens of professional people working for them and this is what they produce?   Is this the best game Bethesda could make? or the least amount of game they could make and still sell it? Because it looks to me that's what they did. They'll let the mod makers sell their game at AAA money for the next several years.",

DLC after DLC that was released was just disappointing at best, and downright miserable at worst.  The new perk system really killed me - I couldn't minmax a character in the direction I wanted? Why not? It's a singleplayer game, so it doesn't need to be balanced for other players that aren't playing with me.  The incredible lack of imagination that came with the factions was just terrible. In past Fallout games, the factions were typically very ingenious - the Legion, the Brotherhood of Steel, the Followers of the Apocalypse, even. But the Minutemen? Really? Not too creative there. You're already in Massachussets; the birthplace of the Minutemen! You didn't even change the name!  The main storyline was....acceptable. It wasn't awful, but I feel a lot more could've been done with it. I remember the ending to Mass Effect 3 (no spoilers here) do you want the green explosion, the blue explosion, or the red explosion? Same here.  Overall, I would recommend anyone to play a friend's copy. But don't spend any actual money on this yet until you are ABSOLUTELY SURE you want it.

The RPG part of Fallout is GONE narrative wise, completely removed in favour of a voiced protag who's easily as uninteresting as the lead from Watch Dogs (whatever his name was) and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Minecraft mechanic that only works in a superficial sense and has no real benefit. The replayability is also hampered by the ̶f̶o̶u̶r̶ but really just one dialogue choice and the removal of the Karma system. Beth has never been great at stories but to add on top of the already weak narrative mechanics is their worst writing to date. Nothing stands out.  Most of the rest of the RPG elements have also been removed with an expanded weapons system which hardly makes up for what was gutted out.  Graphically it's all over the shop. Character models and weapons look upgraded from Fallout 3/NV but the world itself still looks like a budget PS3 title.   The first 2 DLC's are glorified asset additions and Far Harbor is just as bland as the rest of the game and even uglier with all the fog.  Lastly the modding capability: Yes mods MIGHT fix a lot of what's wrong with it but so far a lot of the big Fallout/Skyrim modders look MIA, like they've already lost interest in this and most of the mods (outside of weapons) are little superficial things that don't really add much to the experience. I wouldn't blame them for not really wanting to fix this boring mess as they'll be trying to rebuild 3/4's of the game.   Personally I'm giving this a 5 out of 10, it's an average game at best.

It just seems overall much more shallow than Fallout 3 was, partially from the recycled 'search for that lost relative or something' main story libe, but also because Bethesda shot all of the RPG elements and gave us a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ minecraft structure builder instead.  Being more of a technical person, though, then somebody who cares about the story, this game has to be the worst optimized piece of slop since Witcher 3 was released. While games like Doom and Grand Theft Auto 5 manage to keep up a very solid 60 hz at 4k with relatively high settings, it was rather shocking to me that this game struggled to keep up a steady 30 fps with a Titan X and 12 very powerful threads at its disposal. It obviously isn't just the painfully-out-of-date Gamebryo engine that Bethesda still tries to get by on, as Skyrim, which I have absolutely modded to the teeth, may I add, runs circles around this game at 4k while also better utilizing system resources.  So, in short, this game is a step back in every way possible, but at least you don't have to buy games like Besieged or Minecraft, because the crappily engineered building tools were tossed right in!",

The game can´t hold the climax, after I completed the main quest. After that I explored 80% of the map and was to 'OP' and harder difficulties don´t make the game harder. Due to the (incredibly) bad balance. The harder difficulties just makes the enemies become bullet sponges, which is really boring and annoying...the AI doesn´t change. The DLC´s are good jokes because not every DLC adds story content. Most of the DLC´s adds things for the workshop wich could just be patched and don´t have to be a DLC. I mean there are hundreds of mods that are way better than the workshop DLC´s and they are for free... And the DLC´s that adds story content, don´t fit into the game after you have completed the main quest. The workshop system is all in all a nice idea but it was badly implemented and totally unnecessary.   I can´t recommend anybody to buy this game.

The combat is mediocre at best and the settlement building feels shallow.  ---Story--- I would set a spoiler warning in the beginning but this story is so predictable that i realy don't see the point. When I awoke from the cryo-pod I could say almost emidiatley that quite a substantual amount of time had passed since the kidnapping and Shaun wasn't a baby anymore, I wouldn't have guessed that 60-70 years had passed i'll give you that, my guess was around 30-40, but it wasn't all that unexpected. The twist that the father was Shaun was obvious for at least a couple of hours prior. The endings were all ♥♥♥♥, and the only difference was who you fight in the end and a couple of slides in the ending with no seeming difference in the world except that some types of enemies are gone.  ---Dialouge--- The dialouge system has for some reason been dumbed down from previous fallout games, although I have only played Fallout 3 and New vegas. Compared to those games this is objectivley worse as in the previous games you could see what your character is going to say and you could have less or more than four speech options and any learned skill could find a use in dialouge, being amazing with guns could be good when talking to a gun nut. In Fallout 4 you can only see a word or short frase that is maybe, perhaps describes what your character is going to say. 'Sarcastic' comes to mind, it appearently meaning to shout loudly or to make a bad joke or anything really. The only factor in speaking to anyone is charisma and you could succeed anny charisma check with charisma 1, described in fallout NV as 'Misanthrope'   ---Combat--- The combat is allright, at best. It is better than unmodded Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but modded it is more or less the same, grenade hotkey is good and the cone of fire indicator is apreciated, although this feature could be removed as it makes combat a wee bitt too easy, although having gutted your speech options, Bethesta probably thought that you should have one way to deal with the situation. The leveled feel of the game, meaning that as you level up, stronger monsters spawn, makes every enemy bullet-sponges as I quite frequently had to empty an entire clip from a decked-out combat rifle, one of the more powerfull semi-auto weapons, into a raider, an enemy frequently described as cannon fodder.  As a side note, weapons have little to no uique characteristics from other variations of the same weapon, you could give me a maxed out 10mm pistol and it would still feel the same as the starting one. this means that in vanilla there is, acording to the wiki: three different types of pistols. Two shotguns, ONE SMG, wat?, Five rifles. Five heavy weapons, these are all the rocket launchers and miniguns and the like. and three other weapons, the pipe pistols and other crap you will never use. Energy weapons are: One Cryo, four laser, one plasma and three other. This leaves the base game with a staggering 23 differnt guns, now when you remove every gun that is rarely used, like pipe rifles and fatmen, acording to my opinion, 13. Not all that much of a choice, and melee is the same story.  ---Conclution--- I didn't like my experience in this game as it is no longer an RPG, but I never uninstalled it and it is because it's decent, It is shallow as all hell but decent. I would certantly not recomend you buying this, there is much better games out there and I think that my liking for this product has something to do with Stockholm-syndrome or that I have gone mad.",

Clunking through the dialogue/computer interface is sluggish and annoying. Fallout 1 had a much better interaction/dialogue interface, for instance. That game came out almost two decades ago. The console-friendly UI is awful and slow to use. It's really bad unmodded. Inventory management is an unbelievable pain in the ♥♥♥, an unintentional callback to Fallout 1/2 which had super unfriendly item management.  They streamlined the wrong things and learned the wrong lessons or few lessons from previous titles.  I like that they got rid of durability; that was one thing that I didn't like about Fallout 3. I don't like what they did with power armor.  I like being able to build stuff. I don't care for the provisioner system and how they handle settler management. I don't like that you can't completely prevent a settlement from being attacked. I don't like how cumbersome it is to get a settlement to 100% happiness, where I literally took a nap IRL in the process of getting one to 100%.",

            "review_text": "To sum it up, this game is one step ahead Skyrim in almost every aspect. That being said, none of the RPGs by Bethesda are masters of gameplay nor optimization. The only thing that makes Fallout 4 good, as in Skyrim, is the combination of said features such as gameplay, setting, character customisation. If we looked at those individually it would all in all be quite bad, but that doesn't make the game bad per say. Personally I find open world games where you can turn off your brain and ♥♥♥♥ around the most enjoyable and that's what FO4 succeeds in. Just don't expect it to be much role play, as with all Bethesda games you very rarely have options and your actions don't have consequences.   TL;DR; Better than Skyrim in literally everything except for setting, although that's more up to you. 9/10 personally but as said earlier if we looked at everything individually it's pretty bad.",

            "review_text": "So after 100 hours of playing I think I have a clear picture of what I think of this game.  As someone who has spent more than 2000 hours on this franchise I would say that this is a good contender to the fallout series. Not the best but not the worst either.  The story is alright. Don't get me wrong, I throughly enjoyed it while it lasted but there were a few moments which seemed like easy ways out of explaining things. The story will be the same for everyone in the start but after a while you will have to join a faction which has it's own story path and ways to end the game. Each faction has their own ideology which I enjoyed learning more about.  The characters you meet have good voice acting and interesting backstories. Bethesda did a great job on that. The only thing I disliked is when you talk to anyone, your choices what to say are severely limited compared to the vast variety of choices in the previous game, Fallout New vegas. In that game you could have 9 choices what to say while in this game it's only 4. Due to this you can either way be really mean, really nice or completely natural. Nothing in between which was a let down.  The character building in this game was kinda dissapointing. Sure there were lots of perks to upgrade and it was easy to navigate the perk system but to actually play the game and enjoy most aspects of it, most of your points will be put into modding perks. You will put around 15 points to upgrade perks so you can even mod weapons to be better which is kinda vital to even survive.You can get all perks if you really put time in it but at that point the story will already be long over and there will be almost no fun new places to explore and use your new abilities.  The map size and content in it has been improved compared to the previous games. The wasteland is vastly colourful, but not enough to drown the dark tone of it.You will discover something new almost every time you take a step outside in the wasteland. You will have something to do all the time, either it being you trying to build new settlements, to a simple mission where you are supposed to find a cat.   The only real thing I disliked while on the map and it's content is the vaults not being a major part anymore. In the previous games there were multiple vaults, each having their own interesting dark backstory. In this game there are like what? 5 vaults? 1 where you start which spoils the surprise and 4 others, one whom is fully functioning with people in it which completely depletes any fun chance of exploration.  The customization was actually fun. I spent a lot of hours building new settlements and gathering new supplies only to build them. It's a bit buggy but nothing that will ruin your life. The weapon customization was also fun and finding legendary weapons was a joy however I wish that bethesda still would have put more 'one of a kind' weapons like the alien blaster.   As final words I would like to say: This is a game good for newcommers to the Fallout franchise.  It's easy to play and you can have great fun exploring the vast world of the commonwealth. I say 'good for newcommers to the Fallout franchise' because of how the previous titles don't look as good and because of how more complex they are. If you enjoy this game then i'm sure you will enjoy all other 5 games. My recommendation to play after this game if you are new, is Fallout:3, then Fallout:New vegas, Then Fallout 1, Fallout 2 and finally if you really want to(even though I personally don't like it) play Fallout: Tactics.  Also I would just like to say that I won the race to 100 hours Plank you salty scrublord. Git dunked on.",

The performance on my Superclocked GTX 970 and an i5-4670K is laughable. I'm lucky if i can keep 50FPS for most of the game while running it on high (not ultra). That's funny considering the fact that I can run Witcher 3 nearly maxed out at 60FPS. Sorry, but Bethesda really dropped the ball on this one.

If I did, I'd pick a game on an engine that wasn't outdated a decade ago, with better gun mechanics. It's just building.

None of the side quests are interesting, none of the choices matter, except for one, and every mission is just a fetch quest. All of them. No creative writing thrown in, no zany situations, no interesting characters. Just got something 'new' for you, go shoot this and come back.  Overall, is a great building game. If you like building stuff, you'll love it. If not, don't bother. I love the building stuff so I like the game, and think it's good, it just IS NOT a Fallout game, so I can't reccommend it.

You can lay with Piper which makes this game even better. You can touch the Green wall even though the old man tells you not to.  Only issues I've come across is that the game is unoptimized around certain areas and enemies, but otherwise it's nothing your everyday gaming pc wouldnt chew through. The minimap doesnt tell the whole story, since it's far bigger and vast than what the minimap implies (See Glowing sea), although there are no underwater quests, no underwater buildings or even any water enemies (APART FROM F*CKING MIRELURKS) the map still delivers. Sometimes holdouts of supermutants can be set close by a farm run by settlers, which can ruin the feel of the flow.   There are a lot of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies, the new overhaul on the ghouls is nice. They're no longer spooky as ♥♥♥♥ and trash tier enemies. They're pretty weak mano el mano, but you should never fight them when they outnumber you. Other than the ghouls there are plenty of different types of enemies and even different 'races' of said enemies. + the new legendary system which is okay.  You can build your own HQ and help out people across this godforsaken ♥♥♥♥♥tain of a city.  Although I love the chatwheel, it hasnt brought as much success as it does from the ME series. In Fallout 4 your character has the mentality that he needs to be a sunray of a human being and immune to developing hatred towards mean motherf*ckers. This ruins the RPG feel for many. However I prefer the somewhat unfinished chatwheel with VOICES (YES YOU HEARD ME) instead of just choosing a text and watch the npc's answer you. Would be nice if you could have different options depending if you had a low Intelligence build or a high charisma build, etc. High charisma can lead to you being able to persuade the fools you're talking to. Although it often only leads to extra caps or more information about a mission.  Main story is EHHH, It's kind of cliché, it was easy to guess/predict the story outcome after certain things happened in a certain vault. It does however give you 3 options (or factions I should say). You can play as the Brotherhood of Steel, the mad motherf*ckers with no morale what so ever. Join the Railroad if you wanna free the Synths(some kind of android/robot built by the institute) from the 'evil' Institute. You can join the Institute, which you'll discover when you proceed further in to the storyline. I've yet to try the BHOS story, but I reckon it'll end in nukes dropping on certain locations and people just dying, the BHOS way. Yeah(!).  Also whenever you get the chance DO THE F*CKING SKEETER SIDEQUEST SO YOU CAN GET RID OF HIS AWKVARD RADIO CASTING.  The character cusomization is pretty fly too. thanks fams 9/10 pretty nice game",

            "review_text": "I had very serious concerns that Bethesda would not be capable of topping Skyrim. Well, they did.  Fallout 3 was very conservative when it came to quests. You could run out of things to do rather quickly once you did all of the sidequests, and when you finished the main scenario the game ends. You aren't allowed to continue roaming the world finishing up side quests or exploring to find new areas you didn't see during the main scenario.  Fallout 4 doesn't have this problem. There is a plethora of lengthy, story rich, highly involved side quests to do. In addition, there is the same Radiant Quest System (RQS) which allowed Skyrim to randomly generate new quests and repopulate specific areas with new enemies to fight and new loot to plunder. You have various factions you can join, each with their own story quest line and generated RQS quests. You can also gain experience simply by crafting. Bethesda took what they learned from the Hearthfire DLC and made some improvements. While you can't actually create your own weapons you can modify existing ones to make something unique. At each settlement you establish, you can setup farming, a water supply, defenses, and housing complete with bedding for all of the residence. Finally, there's a reason to collect all that junk out there in the wasteland which previously had no other purpose other than to fill your purse with more caps. Establishing trade and stores in your settlements ensures a good supply of money.  In addition to being able to modify weapons you can also modify armor pieces. You can equip head, chest, arm, and leg armor pieces. Occasionally you will encounter whole body armor on various quest lines that are better than some of the best armor pieces. Then, there is the Power Armor. In Fallout 3 it was treated like any other piece of clothing, but required training from the Brotherhood of Steel to wear. That is no longer the case. The suits are more like a mech now than a suit. You can change the armor segments, repair them, paint them, and even install special equipment like sensors and a thuster pack for high jumps. Unlike Fallout 3, the suits require power in the form of Fusion Cores which you can either buy, or find installed in generators in the basements of various buildings throughout the Commonwealth wasteland.  Some people have complained about the graphics, and 9 out of 10 of them are comparing the graphics to Black Ops 3. There's more to gaming than eye candy, and those who say Black Ops 3 is better than Fallout 4 wouldn't know a good game even if it lobbed a mini nuke at their face. Graphics wise, Fallout 4 is gorgeous! Build upon an updated version of Skyrim's Creation Engine, the game is graphically superior to Fallout 3 and New Vegas by light years. The controversial use of Nvidia Gameworks didn't seem to tank performance like it did with Arkham Knight. I'm using an AMD A10-6800K APU and MSI R9-270 with 8GB of system memory running Windows 10 and I can run the game on Ultra rather smoothly.   Perhaps where Fallout 4 shines the best is it's story. This is hands down the best story Bethesda has ever crafted, period. It is a deeply emotional journey, and you can see inspirations taken from The Witcher and Mass Effect series. It is the main scenario story that will set Fallout 4 apart the most, and if this that good I'd like to see what Bethesda has in mind for any DLC they plan to release. If they do what they did with Skyrim they'll put out two new story rich expansions, and possibly take us to new areas we've never been to before. Chicago, Detroit, who knows?  In closing, my recommendation is 'buy this game now!' It isn't perfect, no game is. 2015 has been really great year for gaming, and some of the best were released all during the later half ot eh year. Fallout 4 stands tall among their ranks.  So, what are you waiting for....buy this game NOW!",

            "review_text": "I would sue Bethesda for the horrible experience that was Fallout 4.  It’s been more than three months since I’ve began playing Fallout 4, and I’ve finally decided that I cannot keep playing this game. It has gotten to a point where it’s making me feel anxious and miserable, where it has become unhealthy to play this game.  Fallout 4 has gone from being a disappointment to becoming completely unbearable, to the point where I cannot keep playing for concern to my health. Right now, if I try to play the game for a couple of hours, I end up with symptoms of stress. There’s always nonsense being said about games making people violent, and nothing is ever said about how truly games can affect your health, specially badly designed games.   Luckily I’m not affected by motion sickness nor any kind of epilepsy, because this game has enough bad visual effects to trigger all kinds of nasty responses of the human brain. I honestly cannot fathom how could this game came out looking so awful. I pity the console players which have no access to mods nor console commands to remove the horrible visual effects that are used throughout the game.  As I said, luckily I was not affected by those in an extreme way, which I’m sure some gamers have suffered, but I’ve felt the strain it has caused in my eyes and brain, in the form of a migraine. I had to limit my sessions with this game accordingly, to avoid the headaches. This wasn’t enough, I’ve still had other symptoms after a couple of hours of play: neck pain, stomachache, bruxism, and sleep disorders (yes, fallout was giving me nightmares).  In my case, all this symptoms generally appear when I’m suffering stress. How is it that a game is making me stressed? It’s supposed be entertainment, something I do to release stress.  One thing I noticed early on was that the ambient music was making me feel anxious all the time. Always gloomy, always dramatic, I tuned into the game’s radios to avoid it. I preferred the classical for a while, but it became too repetitive. Diamond city radio was awful at the beginning, but it became reasonably good after doing one of the side quests. I liked the songs, they gave dimension to the fallout world, but it also became repetitive after a while.  I ended up playing without music at all, that’s when I realized that this game was felling more like a shooter than an RPG (since I usually turn off music in shooters to make it easier to hear footsteps). As a shooter, Fallout 4 is very mediocre, which is sensible, it’s supposed to be an RPG, other rules apply here, and a headshot may not kill everything in one shot because of that.  Anyway, even as an RPG it falls short. After around level 25 I stopped caring about perks, stats, or equipment. It felt like it reached the most you could get from the gameplay, with just tiny variations which didn’t mean much. And, yeah, charisma sucks in this game, it’s mostly worthless in this “go here, kill everything” simulator.  Before getting into the writing of the game, I have to say something about the most horrible UI ever created. If something has to be said about Bethesda, it’s they are consistently getting better at making horrible UI. Adding to the fact that they have not learned anything from previous games (inventory management it’s still a masochist’s delight), they lowered the bar even more by making the most unusable base building system ever created.  I sincerely expected them to copy any of the existing games that allow this kind of mechanic, but they actually come up with something that’s their own brand of awful. No amount of modding is ever going to make this system right. How could they have gotten this so wrong, having excellent examples to follow like Ark Survival Evolved or Space Engineers, is beyond me.  Finally, the storytelling, how they failed this much marks a milestone. I’m not trusting Bethesda again, and I’m grateful I had the wits not preorder any DLC. I can hardly believe these are the same guys that made Skyrim, mind you, the story there wasn’t great, but it worked, it was solid, it was believable.  Since the beginning of the game I knew what the plot twist was, it was predictable, but that didn’t bother me, actually that was what kept me going. I expected a better climax of the story, I knew they were leading me into a hard moral choice, but it wasn’t delivered in a believable manner. The characters development felt shallow, and I expected the main character to collide abruptly with the truth, instead it felt like Star Wars Episode 3.  And then, the moral choice… it cannot be a binary decision, there has to be ground in the middle. After exploring each faction, you realize no one is evil, no one is good either. They all have misconstrued reality according to their bias and prejudice, but you don’t get a chance to rectify any of these. It all ends by you choosing a side, by choosing which prejudice you want to fit in.  I chose none. I chose to stop playing.",

The game has a number of expected flaws because of the age of the engine but is actually quite good. The people, tho suffering from radiation, don't look as diseased and malformed as we've seen in the past.   There is a lot more to do, and keep doing. The game is finishable but for those who just can't seem to put it down there is a very long open road for building up your character, completionists rejoice! Every perk, raised to max is available, if you want to keep at it.   Some questlines are locked by story progression but not so much that you can't go out, build yourself into a godlike being and then do the story, or save that until after, your choice.   Players who like the 'more bang for my buck' ideal will find plenty to do, especially when serious modding starts, players who want to 'play and forget' can also follow that line and just play through the stories, the game is very flexible.   My only real beefs with the game are in the settlements, the 'number of objects' setting is far too low, you get a lot of great things to build, and even unlock more to build but are then forced to keep things to a bare minimum because of the low returns for each object (3 water for a well, 0.5 food for each plant which counts as 1 object placed, etc).   The micromanagment can also be inane, having to assign them to a job is one thing but a bed?? Has radiation rotted their brains to near feral ghoul levels so they can't even pick a damned bed to sleep in without having to stop the glorious leader of the world from saving said world from the very brink of destruction just to tell them where to sleep?!?!

Quests were too Skyrim-ey (go kill this in this place and come back x300) and not New Vegas-ey. The game had sacrificed RPG aspects to make it a full on FP Shooter, and there were few memorable moments. It no longer feels like a 'Fallout' game sadly.",

I mean seriously? Also the only thing that made this game worthwhile was all the mods out there, with the new updates they are constantly breaking mods that worked perfectly before. Honestly what has become of this Company? Every one of their recent games has been terrible. I would still rather play Skyrim than Elder Scrolls Online, Fallout 2 might have terrible graphics but I would revert to that if Fallout Las Vegas and Fallout 3 did not exist since Fallout 4 without mods is a nightmare. It feels like an FPS, It looks like an FPS, it has so little in the way of meaningful dialogue I barely care to read any of it and why the hell are all the characters so irritating. Especially the female companions who more than half the time have impractical goals, ambiguous personalities, and unimaginative back stories with even less creative futures. I appreciate all the effort they put in with the crafting systems, housing, graphics, and cinematics but honestly even those are majorly improved by modders. The crafting system is not nearly as fleshed out as it should have been upon release; there are over a dozen mods out there that rework it all from the ground up and some more than double the crafting options so if a fan written mod that came out a few months after it’s release can do that I think all gamers have the right to feel a little ripped off by the lack of content. I would not have complained if the game itself was $50 at release date but near $100 is what I would expect to pay for a professional game. On the topic of graphics I honestly don’t even want to mention how horrid the textures are. My Skyrim has better textures and although that is due to a mod the fact that modders have made better textures all the way from 1k through to 16k texture packs begs the question; why didn’t Bethesda do better? Even the colony/housing system has been reworked from the ground up by modders that make it look like Bethesda have become a batch of primary schoolers scribbling square houses while dozens of modders have done far better. Not to mention why can you only scrap such a limited number of things in the original game? There’s mess every there no one would leave around if they ran a settlement so why does Bethesda force you to have wrecked houses and crap laying in the streets? Thankfully there is a mod to fix that as well. Has anyone else noticed how some models have black lines where the textures don’t overlap correctly? Thankfully some modder fixed that as well. But now with every update they wreck the experience by failing to keep it compatible with existing mods which means every update or two I need to go without the modder corrected experience and deal yet again with their broken half-♥♥♥♥♥ excuse for a game.   In short:  This game is poorly optimised, poorly designed, poorly scripted, poorly textured, poorly executed, poorly planned, bug ridden, incomplete and extremely limited compared to many games of this genre.  My Conclusion:  Unless you have money to burn and the patience to keep tweaking mods to get a decent experience, don’t buy it. Stick to an older game until Bethesda gets the message and stops trying to rip people off. If there are better free to play games and better mods out there then they have example to learn from and no excuses for maintaining sub-standard quality. ",

            "review_text": "Fallout was my favorite series, the stories in 1 and 2 were superb as was New Vegas. 3 was not bad, but didn't live up to the original creators design. This game completely departs from what the game originated from: An open ended post apocalyptic game with heavy DnD elements to...well, Witcher 3 meets the apocalypse. The combat is superb and feels much smoother this time around, the settlements while a little all over the place, leaves room for a lot of replayability and massive room for modders to have fun, but its just not a fallout game anymore.  I greatly enjoyed this game, and put many hours into it, I won't lie. Its only fault is the expectations set from its predecesors, but to me this is quite a flaw. There are three key factors that really brought this series together for me that it took away.  Open ended decision making - This one many people have voiced about how you can no longer beat the game without killing anyone. However for me, its more than just that. Quests have choices in the form of a 'good' or 'bad' decision typically, and this black and white way of looking at it is what ruined that aspect of the gameplay. Sure, you'll occasionally run into little gems of a quest with multiple ways to handle things with intriguing outcomes such as Covenant, but for the most part its presented in a way of good or evil, not 'how can I use my current strengths to overcome this problem'  The in depth RPG elements - The subtle stuff adds up, things you probably didn't even know were there in the old games really made it shine in ways that make it feel more stale now. A good example is Arcade Ganon from New Vegas: If you couldn't pass his speech checks, having an intelligence of 3 or lower causing him to 'take pity' on you, opting for another option to get the companion. This made sense, seeing as how he's a scientists, but it goes in line with my above point: If you can't accomplish something with your character build you could think outside the box to get it done. Fallout 4 was too concerned with barring players off from experiencing everything in one playthrough, and because of this set apart what made 'personalizing your build' more fun. I get because of the settlements they wanted you to have everything on one nice save file rather than playing the role of multiple characters experiencing the world in their own way, but there are so many ways to go about this without taking away from the rest of it. Now that everything is combat centric, I never find myself carrying chems to pass certain checks or handle situations in a different way...I only carry chems to enhance combat capabilities. It was these small things that really made replaying the same quest fun. I almost feel like im playing a highly detailed MMO of quest and level as fast as possible.  Everything about role playing is gone - This one was major for me, and what truly set this game apart from others. From the beginning your goal is clear: find your son. They also basically force the quest onto you and give you a sense of urgency with it, wereas 3 and new vegas gave your goal, but basically just set you free in the world without empasizing it so heavily. The other big change was giving your character a voice, the issue here is it also gives him a personality: its impossible to paint him as anything other than someone who is desparate to find his son. It seems minor, but it changes a lot especially with the context your character says things in. You are no longer designing your own story, but living out someone elses.   On top of all this, the story was forced on you from the momeny you leave the vault, and the story itself is essentially a series of ripoffs of other popular sci-fi media. (Bethesda likes to call them 'references' but lets face it, the references typically lack a sense of originality to them) but some people liked it, and honestly I don't care much if the main story isn't on par, because for me its not the story, its the lore of the world that captivates me.   Now that I've said all that, is this really a problem? For some, no it isn't. its still a fun game, and if you didn't play the old fallouts with the roleplaying or DND-style mindset you probably don't even notice why people hate it. However, when it comes down to it, its very clear what they were trying to do: copy bioware and project RED's open world style. For a company that basically defined open world, they are drifting from their origins and replicating concepts from games that were inspired by them. I'm not knocking on Dragon Age or Witcher in any way, but while Elder Scrolls and Fallout have always been about YOUR story, these games are about someone elses story. The story in those games seem more polished and detailed, but as a result you can't build it yourself, for the most part, and that has me worried for the future of their open world games. However, they did manage to give us one speckle of good faith....   The last ray of hope: Far Harbor - This doesn't live up to the standards New Vegas set with their expansions, but this was a DLC done right. The lore is much more detailed, there are many ways to go about various problems, and rather than feeling forced down one quest line with side quests piling up, early on I got that sense of 'go anywhere, do what you want' that I was looking for, and eventually the quests just...came together like they should. Bethesda may have realized their mistake, and brought back the choices and some of the role playing elements I came to love. Its also the best story in Fallout 4 by a pretty large margin. I can understand them wanting to place a larger emphasis on story, but hopefully in future games it will be more like Far Harbor: a happy medium between the two I feel both types of gamers can enjoy.   Would I buy Fallout 5 if it did the same thing? Yes. I imagine many others who are disappointed with this one will, too. Bethesda will get their profits either way, but if Bethesda wants to stick to a company 'for the gamers' as they tout (and have slowly been drifting away from) then they should appeal more to both sides next time around, the long term fans have been pretty vocal about what they want and I really hope they deliver next time around.",

It has smooth FPS mechanics, a fun building system, and a vast, be it semi-empty, world to explore. But, is it a good Fallout game? Does it live up to the previous installments in the series? The answer to that question is simply no. Fallout 4 is a massive dissapointment in terms of roleplaying and storytelling.  The first thing that is blatantly wrong with Fallout 4's so called 'roleplaying' mechanics, is the dialogue system. In Fallout 1, 2, 3 (to an extent) and esspecially New Vegas, I got a chance to enjoy my conversations with NPCs almost entirely due to the extremely varied range of choices I had. This is not the case in Fallout 4. Your choices in most conversations boil down to:  Yes Sarcastic (yes) No (yes) Question or vague statment, turns out completely different when selected  or  Yes Sarcastic (yes) No (no) Question or vague statment, turns out completely different when selected  The worst thing is, I entirely expected this level of garbage even before I pre-ordered this game. As soon as they showed the gameplay tech demo at E3, I knew I was in for a rough ride. Is this the level we have stooped to? I can't tell if it's Bethesda pandering to a wider audience, or us becoming increasingly stupid and simplistic. There is simply no room for meaningful dialogues with a system like this. Sure it worked well in games like Mass Effect, but Fallout isn't Mass Effect to any extent.  The next big issue is the skill system. In an effort to stop players from levelling up in all skills, they ended up instead doing the exact opposite by removing the level cap and making it even easier to max your skill in all areas. No longer must you use exploits early in the game, this game essentially does it for you. The new system boils down into an extremely over-simplified perks system where you pick a new trait literally every ♥♥♥♥ing level. This makes the game INCREDIBLY easy. Gone are the days of meaningful character development, you can easily become a ♥♥♥♥ing Ubermensch upon reaching level 15.  And now for one of the worst parts of the game, character development and storytelling. In previous titles, you were given an extremely vague background with lots of room for interpretation. This is very good for roleplaying, as you can come up with your own character and really play as them. But in 4, you are given a very hamfisted description and background. You are a veteran or a lawyer (depending on who you pick), you have a spouse, you have a child, you live in Sanctuary hills... you see what I mean now? There isn't really any character you can play as other than worried mother/father (the ♥♥♥♥ dialogue system doesn't really help at all).  And so my rant has come to a close, I don't want to spoil the story so I will end it here. Overall, this game is total trash if you are looking for a Fallout experience, almost as ♥♥♥♥-tier as Fallout Tactics or Brotherhood of Steel. Please don't support Bethesda in ruining one of the greatest RPG franchises out there, do yourself and everybody else a favor, don't ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game. ",

But the more I played being forced to be the good guy, the less and less I thought of making a second character. The voice acting doesn't bother me, but the fact that you can't, let's say, talk to children as if you were one like you can in Fallout 3, or use fear tactics to effortlessly get people to do things for you like you can in New Vegas, is a let-down to say the least. The sarcasm is, frankly, the best part of the whole game: 'Can you say that like Dr. Frankenstein? Egor, fetch me the brain! Sorry.' It, however, doesn't makeup for the lack of varied dialogue. Nothing has really stuck out in Fallout 4 like in the other Fallout games like New Vegas where you can join different factions that all will result in different endings or when skipping one task could slightly alter the ending, or in Fallout 3 where you could sell fingers or ears for caps and good/bad karma. All in all, I'd definetely recommend Fallout 4 to someone who's never played a Fallout game but would hesitate for someone who has played the previous Fallout games.

The storytelling falls short of the New Vegas expansions in terms of plot and catharsis. It has a ton of stuff packed into it, but with seemingly no direction or purpose.  Your efforts for seeing it through for possibly hundreds of hours is a 20 second recap that delves nothing into what consequence you had on the world of the Commonwealth. Radiant quests are a cruel endless waste of time. Building settlements is kind of neat, but ultimately is once again pointless to any outcome or significant gameplay.

Fallout 4 can be summed up as follows:  Your son is taken, you team up with a faction to kill him with a nuke, or he just dies of old age. THE END.  There wasn't that moment in the game where the president is a computer or the wild voice acting like at the BIG MT make the world feel really weird and alive in that sci-fi kind of way. This game just has the most dialogue ever in a Bethesda game and most of it is just bland blather. Your protagonist isn't totally ruined by being voiced, but they have to comment on every god damn obvious thing you already see and say it out loud. Speaking of which, almost every dialogue choice leads to the same conclusion, making them near pointless.  Speaking of pointless, Radiant quests. I thought I was saving settlements and building new ones to some end. After 30 or so of the same save a kidnapped lady in a place I already saved her I looked up wtf I was doing. 'Oh, these never end' I said to myself. A guy from Forbes already wrote THE article on this though, just Google: Forbes Fallout 4 radiant quests.  Difficulty jumps so far all over the place it's brutal. One minute you are fighting Styrofoam monsters, next thing you know a legendary so and so shows up and you are dead. Is there a clear path to Diamond city that levels you up gradually and you problem solve through it, probably not because you have raiders with fatboy nukes 20 min in and you are already dead. Don't get me wrong, challenging can be fun, but challenging and inconsistent is no fun. You level up so slowly but the game has a million spots that will ruin a low level character seemingly at random and once you hit 45 most of everything is a cakewalk unless you get swarmed.  The sound and visuals are wonderful though. Far away things sound far away, not just quieter. If some raiders are far away they sound far away. No gunshots or explosions are background decor, they are happening and you can judge their distance and location based on it, its quite remarkable really. Too bad you can never really clear the raider and mutant nests for good.  Whoever designed the Corvega plant can go to hell, what a confusing mess to get through, especially multiple times. And that USS Constitution quest was designed by a bland psychopath, albeit it is amusing at the end.  Bethesda seemingly blew all of the atmosphere building moment on the beginning of the game and some choice spots here and there but man it's just kind of a disappointment overall. Play it have fun, just don't expect much from it. You have to make it your own survival game to get much out of it.",

            "review_text": "I have to first say that im not a big fan of the Fallout Series, i never played Fallout 1 and 2, and only played for a few hours in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. but i have over 100 hours of content (yes i know many people have way more but im telling from my experience.) and i can say that Fallout 4 is not a RPG, when i think of 'RPG' i think of choosing your charactor and choosing a role (duh) that has meaningful consequences and choices. if your role does not impact the world or barely changes anything in the world, what is the point of your role? If i go around being a Shady Assassin, I should expect to be treated differently then a hero Knight thats loved by everyone.   In Fallout 4, other then killing everybody there is barely any consequences for your choices, but thats okay because there's hardly any choices in this game. the only (real) choice in this game is the ending when you find someone you're looking for and you have to decide which of the 3 factions you have to stay with. (which involves killing the other two, so in reality there's really only one faction) after doing this i went back and did the other endings. I was so disappointed that they were essentially carbon-copys of one another, reminding me of the Mass Effect 3 ending, and anything reminding me of that is not leaving me with a good taste.  People will often say 'well the gunplay is better then fallout 3 and New Vegas' thats true but they forget something: this is a series known for being an rpg and having meaningful choices, if i wanted to play a shooter i would just go play Call of Duty.  Now I was willing to leave alone the fact that this games graphics and engine are not up to par with most Triple A games, and looks quite terrible in comparison, but this game (at least on pc) has terrible framerate drops and the game does not look the part to justify it, when my Frame rate drops in Battlefield 4 or Witcher 3 i can understand because it looks the part, when my frame rate drops in Fallout 4 i'm more often then not looking at a poorly rendered wall.  The Dialogue system is incredibly dumbed down, its just a max of 4 choices most of which npcs will not react any differently from one another. in fact changes like this are what is keeping the older hardcore Fallout fans up in arms about this game. Bethsada seems to think (or at least treat like) that you're an uneducated idiot whos too dumb to think about what your words will do.  The Settlement system seems to be a pro for some people because you can now customize settlements and make them into towns. that's nice until you realize that it's tacked on, theres no tutorial on how to do it and theres almost no rewards for doing it and the only interaction is to assign settlers to do certain things. many of these things because theres no tutorial to explain them involves a lot of trial-and-error and d***ing around for hours. if i wanted to build towns, i would just go play The Sims or Minecraft.  Overall this game is not a RPG. compared to Witcher 3 (and its expansions) this is not even close. So is Fallout 4 a good Game? its gonna be dependant on you and what type of game you're looking for. if you're looking for a good shooter and builder, you may like Fallout 4. if you're looking for an RPG with meaningful choices, this is not it, go buy Witcher 3 and its two expansions for a much better Rpg. This game is proof that Bethesda thinks that games will sell more by just making them more simplistic and bland.",

With that said fallout 3 had more content and more dept in story telling then fallout4. NV had way more story and game play and was my fav so far. Excpet the fact it had huge game breaking bugs. The graphics with mods fallout 4 is the best looking. I don't care for the base building at all. I actually find it distracting and breaks me out of the story and exploring too much. I would of rather the dev/CEOs had added a better storytelling element or hired better writers and added more underground areas like a whole subway system and sewer system like fallout 3 had.   Some of the buildings are way too small in fallout4 specially inside. Which I miss explrong and finding hidden holes that lead to new areas like in fallout 3. Each area so far is disappointing to say the least. I don't see random things between npcs like I saw wandering the capital wastes of fallout3 which I miss a lot.   Lack of dailog choices and lack of unique story telling make this the worst fallout I played yet. I think the devs completely missed the the mark on what a fallout is to people who like to play it in excahnge to applease casuals. To sum up Fallout4... Its very shoot first and ask questions later the whole story through...  The way Fallout4 is I would say its fallout COD edition. Fallout 4 is a solid action shooter fps that is quite fun on cheap thrills. With that said I say it is a poor lazy lack luster RPG with little to no exploration or storying telling.  Example.. The first faction you meet will treat you like their leader or superman/woman of the wastes. Your choice is always something along the lines of...'This looks like a job for.... YOU!' Superman/woman of the wastes ; ). Or... 'You are our only hope...'&lt;--- insert player name. This is the reaction with all the factions. Except the ones you kill first then see who they were.

Not that there's many 'good' points, because it's 'just another fallout game' with no real innovation and nothing that makes it stand out. The good: - Graphics have improved over the previous fallout games albeit still outdated. - Probably enough content in here for roughly 100 hours of unique gameplay. - The new power armor is amazing.  The bad: - The main storyline is short, one could go through the main storyline in less than 5 hours (while not rushing). - The game is too easy (even on survival mode). - Dialogue options have been dumbed down significantly. Not only can you not see what your character is about to say, but all of the New Vegas abilities like speechchecks for every stat (Medicine 15/30 - I erm... know how to stab people with a syringe) are gone. A real shame that. - Terrible controller-oriented UI with the PC version hacked in - Performance is decent, but the game is too heavy for the actual graphical fidelity given. - NO SLI support (my second gpu is just... sitting there...) - Random crashes. Just going straight to desktop, no error messages or anything, and at seemingly random times. - Corrupted saves, past the 10h mark I had to restart my savegame as it was all corrupt. - Windowed fullscreen with G-Sync limits you to 15fps. - Having a monitor with more than 60Hz native refresh WILL glitch out the games physics, causing you to get stuck at several occasions (I quicksave roughly every 30 seconds because of this)  All in all, this game radiates (heh, get it, radiates) laziness. It has all the same glitches and issues of all the previous Bethesda games. I lost count of the amount of times I got stuck because of either the physics engine, NPCs getting stuck, falling through the world / walking through the wall etc etc  tl;dr Don't buy this until it gets a serious amount of patches / discounts.",

All in al, it would seem the developers took the nostalgia/ branding and used it to cover up some of the sloppier, reptitious, portions of the game. Ill go through the pros and cons.  PROS:  Amazingly better gunplay- never feel like you need to use VATS again  The world- Its built supremely well. Very few locations just feel there. Boston is done very well with the buildings and layouts.  The Creatures: Deathclaws are actually frightening, bloatflies are more disgusting, and stingwings are just as stingy. Combined with better graphics and animations, the creatures feel more vivid and alive.  CONS:  THE QUESTS ARE ALL THE SAME. I hate this so much. Every brotherhood quest is go there and do this. Clear out this station, find this tech. Its all the same. Gets really boring after a while.  Bugs- Many people think bugs are just part of a Bethesda thing. However, i didnt see alot of people saying the same when BF4 laucnched with DICE, or Arkam Knight with Warner Brothers. While some bugs are understandable, the sheer amount are frustrating. Whether its your companion disapearing with your favorite weapon, or your Pip-Boy and weapon randomly turning invisible, the bugs are frustrating and a pain to deal with.  Performance/Graphics: I have a fairly decent PC (see below), can run heavily modded Skyrim no prob, but even on high settings, i get massive frame instability from the low 40s to the glorious rare moments of 72 FPS. Very annoying, hope it gets patched soon.   As far as graphical fidelity, the game is okay. I understand that bethesdas teteures have never been up to par, but some textures are just embarrasing. From the bricks on nearly all the buildings, to the low res- leather that comes up with your pip-boy. The graphics and performance just dont match up. While a brilliant looking, but average trunning game is understandable, the engine clearly needs a replacement, not a rebranding.  VERDICT:   Overall, the game is a bit of a letdown. I wanted Bethesda to learn some new things, use some feedback. Instead of a more beautiful, diverse New Vegas, its more like skryrim with guns. If your looking for a great RPG, I heavily reccomend the Witcher 3. Overall, its a much better game and the developers are awesome. I hope Fallout gets patched a bit more, but for now, I just can't recomend it.   Thanks for reading my first review, hope you enjoyed.

            "review_text": "**Spoilers in this review** Don't read it if you don't want spoiled plot points.  I just finished the story line choosing the Institution as my first-time playthrough because it only felt right since his son is part of it. My first thought as I went into the institution is that I finally get to go into this giant tech underground facility; but the story of the son being fully grown and even older than the character we play, makes it feel very weak. It's hard to feel sympathetic to an elderly man ontop of a tech giant underground facility, than it is to a child stolen from you lost in the wilderness. We learn at first that his son is a child and everyone sort of feels connected to a child because it's a big dangerous world and we want to find this person and protect them from the dangers of the lore, but an elderly man? I immediately disconnected from the story. It felt odd to talk to a guy that has been seemingly alive, well fed, well rested, very well taken care of, has everything he could possibly need AND to learn that he knew you were alive but was watching you to see what type of person you are to find him? (such a terrible story line)  That was my first issue, disconnection from the story.   Secondly the portion of the game where literally anything you say, has the same consequences in any part of the lore that has to do with personal interaction. I can choose sarcasm, I can make fun of the character speaking to me, or I can be serious; their immediate response after is different to each choice you make, but the line after that, is back to the topic at hand, no matter which choice is made. Interaction with the world feels very disconnected and pointless to go out of your way to talk/help any AI. Even sticking to the main quest is pointless. Makes me feel like the developers were in special needs classes, 'everyone's a winner! There is no wrong answer.' That would explain S.P.E.C.I.A.L   It makes interaction with the AI pointless. Mine as well make the character a mute and use sign-language.   No matter what faction you choose, you need to rub two out. And once you rub two out and become the 'top dog' faction leader, no one has any clue in the open world who you are, and has absolutely no change in any lore what so ever when your status in that faction changes. I completed it and made it out as director of the Institute, went back to my base town and got told about how there's mutants bothering a settlement and I need to go save them. Um hello? I run the institute, let me go get some synths and let them deal with it.. Oh wait, I don't have that kind of power.. Because I'm the leader of the faction, but for some reason I'm not and no one knows who I am... STUPID!   One final thing that peeved me was the optimization of resolution. The optimization of the resoluton is a joke for a game to be released in 2015 and not have the ability to choose 4k resolution from the game menu. I play all games on a 4k resolution Smart TV and to have to edit the preferences in both the documents and the game folder is ridiculous for 2015. Especially if you wanted to change it to 1920x1080 resolution without changing your desktop resolution to 1920x1080; that was an epic challenge, but after much tampering I finally concluded I can do it, so long as I do not mind a windowed-mode bar ontop of my screen while I play. I know I am not the only one to complain about this, lots did.   Overall the story, the game and everything put together is just weak. I also dislike the map. I liked Fallout NV much better, open world that was much larger and had fun things to do, Fallout 4 just seems confined and congested. Plus load screens between each building.. I spent half my game-time loading/waiting (even on an SSD, the loading is slow).   The graphics were the only truly enjoyable part about the game. I could not stand the limitations on the settements; got a mod for that. I could not stand the dry boring atmosphere; got a mod for that. I could not stand the sky, moon and terrible water quality; got a mod for that. Overall I ran over 41 mods to make the game more enjoyable for me, without those mods this game would have been shelved long ago. That was always a key to Fallout; mods, but the developers need modders, because leaving them to create a masterpiece just doesn't happen.   I had to play it through one time to see the major defects. All I can close with is; I don't understand how the top reviewers played this game for 250+ hours, even with mods. I'm at 85 hours and I am ready to gouge my eyes out of their sockets. Uninstalling this and shelving it.. Moving onto the next game.",

On the first playthrough I found it semi-okay. The world had ugly textures, enemies were bullet sponges and the story was uninteresting, but I liked the fact they pjut in a semi-decent faction system, gave weight to companions and had basebuilding.  On the second playthrough, the all around shitiness shows.  Here's just a few of the brilliant things you'll experience in Todd Howard's Masterpiece!  -A forced backstory that feels so cliche and unimaginative that drives the entire story!  -A lack of roleplaying potential, hope you like either being concerned parent, or sarcastic concerned parent!  -A lack of choice in diaogue or the story, you'll experience the narrative like bethesda wants you too! Doesn't matter if you tell the npc to ♥♥♥♥ off, they'll still give you the quest!  -A new perk system that means you can be a full 10ed Special character with every perk, no matter what!  -A Story that ♥♥♥♥♥ all over the lore, for some reason in this post apocalyptic 50's styled wasteland, teleportation and near human AI is possible. Despite it being 210 years since the bombs fell, there are only 2 actual settlements, each having about 20 people. Every other building is covered in nameless raiders.  -A story totally focused on Synths (Because ♥♥♥♥ wanting an actual Fallout plot), with a debate that holds no weight since there is literal evidence everywhere that synths have human emotion  -A small map that is 30% water, filled with copied and pasted buildings filled with raiders.  -An ugly world with terrible textures and graphics from 2009!  It doesn't matter if this game was a literal 2 minute video of someone taking a ♥♥♥♥, Bethesda fans will still defend it to the grave because they think they're le manly gentleman geniuses for playing an 'RPG'.

Bethesda games have been like interactive books that gave me real solid different choices. The story was theirs, but I could choose my direction. It was beautiful. Then another company did New Vegas and it was the best RPG I've ever played. I couldn't wait to see what my favorite developers would do after all the great directions New Vegas went. Bethesda was my favorite developer. Until now.  This game took out all my favorite RPG elements. I felt no connection to my character or the story. The side quests were almost all 'go shoot these people and or things.' Since skills were gone all the amazing skill specific dialogue is gone. I knew what was going to happen with Shaun at the end of the game an hour after I started. The depth, thinking elements, and soul of what made Fallout great was taken out.  The shooting and world were the only improved aspects. I loved the Commonwealth, too bad that my options were so limited while I was there. Except I wasn't there, the pod person I was saddled with at the begining was there, it was not immersive. Also the base building was pretty cool, but it wasn't worth it. If they 'streamline' the next elder Scrolls I'm never going to buy Bethesda ever again. My friend and I have a pact to wait a month before buying, and the if we don't like it after playing for a day, we are returning it.",

This game takes a fantastic franchise and turns it into a scrap collection simutator. The settlements are a joke, I wish they left this out all together.

Reasons that I dislike this game 1. Settlement building doesn't work well, often times are spent moving pieces around without any real idea why they are not fitting together, which it seems they don't far more often then they do. It simply doesn't work. 2. NPC interactions feel to be too much of a dice roll without any real substantial options. You're given 4 choices and they are never fully shown, sometimes it is simply safer to choose yes or no because you don't always know where the other options will lead. 3. The game is far too easy even on the highest difficulty setting, including the new survival setting. It seems that the developers don't have any real clue as to what constitutes a challenge and poke around bllindly with damage settings hoping for the best, and failing. 4. Overall story telling seems to be getting neglected, most of it seems hollow and empty. 5. Settlements again. The size of the settlements are generally lacking in space, though some of that has been addressed with the newest dlc, the sizes of all of the settlements should have been dramatacally increased right from the start, why does it seem that in one of the best selling 'open world' franchises our hands are being tied throughout the game. 6. Settlers are way too generic, glitchy and boring. 7. Although the graphics are fairly decent, it seems that much more could have been done with the overall texture quality.  I am a fan of the modding community which makes many of these compaints moot, but I think much more should have been done from Bethesda itself.",

However this is the first game where I felt no connection with the my character, the plot, the characters, factions, or choices. Its not that there aren't choices, or they lack any meaning full cause and affect. Its that there is no choice for a neutral, good or amicable end. Its just a murder run with a vanilla plot.   You can't work with more than one faction with out one not liking you. You can't sway any ones decisions or the story line. And about half way through I found myself sitting there going, 'You know, there isn't a single out come that I want to see till completion.' So I went off to see how many people in each group I could kill in my lovely power armor. Turns out you can kill a lot of people.... so there's that, I guess.   Building settlements was fun for a minute but you soon realize there's no point. No one is any happier, no meaning full resources come of it. With out mods you can't really build anything the way you'd want. And no matter how big, productive or safe they are. Makes zero impact in the wastes. So why do it?   There is some cool stuff, air ships, power armor, some of your companions, fighting mechanics....and... ummm, maybe that bit with the robots racing around the dog track. Course that turns into s-storm since you're attact the second you get close enough to see whats going on... Then your companion decides its a good idea to shoot at all the robots. So now on top of 20 raiders you have to deal with psycho killing machines coming at you.  This all comes about because you thought 'Hey cool, robots racing. Maybe I can place some bets or something, what fun.' I think this sums up the game for me. Hey look something cool, oh, we're fighting again. Dang, now its gone/broken/taken. This is why we can't have nice things!  Over all its a lovey sand box full of angry self righteous a-holes. (So pretty close to real life I guess) Where your only connection to the world dissolves about a quarter of the way though. Then you spend most of the game wandering the wastes picking up garbage. Just have it thrown back in your face at every turn. And no matter what you choose, people are going to die and your friends hate you. If I wanted realism, I wouldn't be playing a game.   And I know its a dead horse... But coming from countless hours playing Morrowind/Oblivion/Skyrim/Fallout3/New Vegas (Soo much fun, NV). I didn't expect after 300+ hours to not care about even bothering to finish the first play through. Its kind of the same feeling as playing Mass Effect 3 after loving ME1&amp;2.

            "review_text": "Just like, say, a car that's fun to drive but is unreliable, I enjoy this game, but I can't unequivocally recommend it. You might enjoy it - you might find it mind-numbingly dull or enragingly frustrating.  The best part of the game is the visual experience. It's fantastic, awe-inspiring, occasionally even breathtaking. I'm not just talking about the superb graphics and the wonderful and varied weather system. There's been an amazing level of attention paid to the fictional alternate universe this game is set in. The wasteland is littered with rusted-out hulks of cars, trucks, buildings, and gadgets that are of a unique style. Everything looks like it fits in. You even see tattered posters and dilapidated billboards advertising these items! It's such a comprehensive visual treat, I wish there was a version of the game that let you see everything before it was ruined as well.   The music is also quite good. There's a refreshing amount of variety in the slow, quiet tones that accompany you as you explore, and then when combat starts, you may become vaguely aware of the subtle but urgent hammering of more intense music. The radio stations that one can tune into also offer a wide variety of enjoyment.   The basic, unaided combat system seems fairly good. The firearms and the sighting systems certainly seem easy to use, and distinct from one another. The melee weapons seem more same-y and occasionally difficult to target.  Although it's clunky, the settlement-building tools are very enjoyable, and given the freedom with which you can build, I can excuse any odd behaviors within the settlement building function. The system by which one mods weapons and armor also seems fairly robust, though the melee weapons seem unfinished. A simple pistol or piece of armor can have two dozen or more mods to choose from, while I have yet to see a melee weapon that has more than three mods available to be crafted.   Where the game starts to fall down is the dialogue and the storyline.   First of all, the player is forced into a particular background, so any kind of unique character building is quashed by this. That's a Fallout series tradition though, so I can't complain too much about that.  Secondly, the NPCs and the resulting conversation dialogues are extremely shallow. At reply points, the player is presented with four reply options, but in many cases the replies are actually identical, regardless of how it is labeled.   What voice actors they did hire seem to have done a wonderful job. This game's dialogue has some of the best emoted voices I've ever heard in a game - unlike the often flat, emotionless voices in many other games.   Unfortunately, as happens too often, there are far too few voice actors, and so you end up hearing the same voice on many different NPCs. I can understand having one voice actor for a few scattered NPCs, but sometimes in this game it feels like they hired eight people for the hundreds of NPCs.   The storyline and quest system unfortunately continue this disappointment. The main storyline is so mediocre I didn't even realize there was one until I looked it up on a game wiki. I was having far more fun exploring. Most of the other quests are disappointingly short, often just pointing you towards a building with a few rooms to clear of raiders of ghouls. So far, I haven't found any puzzles to solve, or anything that really engages the mind or is otherwise compelling.  The traditional V.A.T.S. is in, but suffers from many problems. Firstly, because the target selection boxes are so small, and enemies (and the camera) move around so jerkily, it's very difficult to click on the target you want. Furthermore, every time you open up V.A.T.S., the game may freeze up entirely, and can't even be closed - you have to reboot your computer.   The enemies that are in the game are good, but unfortunately sorely lacking in variety. Just like Skyrim felt like 90% Draugr and Bandits, Fallout is mostly Ghouls and Raiders, with the occasional Super Mutant patrol to spice things up. And the AI is no more robust than any other game, so there's very little tactical thinking to be done in combat.  Although there are several things to like about the game, because of the disappointing portions, and the instability, and the ridiculously high price of the disturbingly shallow DLC, I can't recommend this game. I'm not saying definitely don't buy it, I just can't bring myself to endorse it either. I'd choose 'Indifferent' or 'Unsure' if that was an option.",

Everyone called out of work (Or at least quipped about doing so), other gaming companies have referenced it, and reports say that it's breaking sales records. I recommend it, especially if you're a fan of the revival of the franchise. Despite this, the game is not without flaws.  Now, I'm a very chill player. My panties did not become twisted over the power armor rehaul, the early deathclaw attack, the graphics (I'm just happy it can even run on my badly prebuilt computer). the odd dialog system (Which I find a little irritating) and even the perk system doesn't bother me too much. If anything, it's just remniscent of their work on Skyrim (Which people are still playing four years later). But you may hear tales of how... punishing FO4 is compared to its predecessors.  New Vegas had its own 'Hard' areas. Namely that if you went straight north as soon as possible, you'd run right into a quarry of deathclaws. FO4 boasts that the farther south you go, the harder the enemies become. This doesn't seem to translate that well into the game. Starting on Easy difficulty, one of my first quests is to get to the main city: Diamond City. A mere twenty minutes into my game, skipping the settlement tutorial quests (I just wanted to see the world and was not about to waste two hours in one town - I got into that much later), I ran into a gunner gang and died immediately. Reloading save, I evaded this encampment and ran into a super mutant takeover that's right in front of the bridge to Diamond City. Dieing again, I blasted my way through them (Knowing what to expect) only to be detroyed by a measily raider armed with the Fat-Man, a nuke-launcher.  There's 'beef gates', difficulty levels, and challenging. All of this? Was downright unfair to a gamer's first two hours into the game. I understand the need for a certain learning curve but I was gunned down and torn apart on the upper third of the map. I died dozens of times before coming into my own.  I will say things go a bit more smoothly as the game trucks on as you gain access to various faction quests. Even the radiant quests (Similar to Skyrim's unlimited questing) help you get the lay of the land while supplying you with the necessarily resources to build on your weapons.  My point is, after a while you start to get a 'feel' for the game and it quickly becomes obvious why everyone you know has gathered several dozen hours on the game. I just want to warn anyone I can to be very, very careful. Regardless, the game is certainly worth it if you're a fan of Bethesda's work in general. Skyrim. With guns.",

The main point of other fallout games was the amount of decisions you could make within the game.

In fallout 4 there are 2 endings you save the institute or you destroy it. I found this really dissapointing that they would take out so many role playing elements that many people loved about the old games. Giving us a character who lived pre war and was a soldier really takes away from us being able to create our own backstory about the story, In New Vegas you were a courier shot in the head and left for dead, you could build off of that however you wanted to. Even in fallout 3 another Bethesda Fallout, you were an 18 year old kid going off to find your dad and even though the main ending for that game was you helping the brotherhood stop the enclave, you could still make an evil decision and poison the wastelands water supply.   In fallout 4 (before Nuka World) you couldnt be straight up evil, yah you could go in killing everyone but there was so many essential npcs that was nearly impossible, the first town you walk into makes the commander of the minutemen (the good guys of the commonwealth).

Now many people will say 'Nuka World' lets you be evil, but as of the dlc coming out everyones built settlements and it doesnt make sense to be the general of the minutemen and then also go around raiding settlements. Those are my main points of why I dont recomend the game. Here are my pros and cons of the game.  PROS- Improved combat system from other fallout games Interesting take on power armor Weapon and Armor customization Companion overhaul  CONS- Need a super computer to run the game with steady 60 fps without mods Taking away main RPG Elements from other fallout games Mediocre story Complete removal of karma system  Over all that is my opinion on fallout 4 a fun game but definetaly not a fun FALLOUT game.

As someone who played the absolute hell out of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, this was a considerable disapointment. It should have been better in every way, and all it did was take 2 steps forward, and 2 steps back.  The main quest traverses some interesting ground for the series, and the voice acting is quite good in places, but the dialogue system did miss the mark in the end. There's an extreme shortage of other non proc-gen quests in the game, and only a modest handful of what I would personally deem as interesting NPCs. Paired with the stats rework, it makes proper roleplaying next to impossible.  The gunplay has been incredibly revitalized, equaling that of most other shooters of today, However, there's a staggering deficiency in weapon and armor variety, and even mid-level enemies scale to become ridiculous bullet sponges in the end game past level 70. ..Not to mention that the player does some wierd stuff when you play in 3rd person.  There's a very large wasteland to explore with plenty of collectables to find and dungeons to clear out, and nearly all of which find something to be unique about - but respawning dungeons largely make the experience devoid of value or any sense of progression, and the atmosphere is only the barest step up from New Vegas - which itself was a colossal step down from Fallout 3.  The base building is fun for quite a while, and makes a good use all the junk in the world, but it feels incredibly restrictive, like the PC is being held back for mechanics that had to work on console. After a while, I kinda think back to how much more I enjoyed having to memorize the very important “junks” items in the Mojave that I could use for clever crafting recipes – and that's largely gone.  It just makes me want to mod a house instead. Speaking of which… where is the GECK?  I could get 400 hours into both Fallout 3 and New Vegas before I had to turn to mods, and for the later, I got another 400 hours out of the experience. With Fallout 4? The game feels like it has a terminal shortage of things to do after the 200 hour mark, and even the Survival Beta just doesn't seem like anything interesting.  Maybe the GECK will make things better when it does eventually come out, and at least Fallout FROST will be coming out for it one day- but for the time being, Fallout 4 is the Dark Souls 2 of the series. Still quite good, better than most, but what a disapointment.  A real 7.5 / 10.",

For example : The institute is looking to build this reactor and say ' you have helped speeding this up significantly ' - not like they can send an army of synths there and just flood the place. It just does not feel genuine.  Combat system : It feels good and since I am playing squishy characters most of the time I really have to focus on hitting and evading shots. The combat system is really good and much better than other Fallout parts.  The 'only' thing that really annoys me is that the Lategame gets boring. I have played the story with every faction and thought 'maybe exploring the wastelands and doing radiant quests would be nice' - it isn't. After 100 hours ingame I am bored to death.

For example, the amount of quests in Fallout 4 is low when compared to games like Fallout 3 or Skyrim and a lot of the sidequests in Fallout 4 are recycable ones where you do the same thing over and over again and the main quest itself is pretty short.  I believe the poor quality of things such as quests is caused by the fact that the game has new gameplay content (such as the new settlement system) and instead of focusing on one aspect, they have divided it onto multiple parts of the game. Meaning that instead of having a very fun time adventuring you're going to have an OK time adventuring AND an OK time building settlements.   And while the game has bugs, like Bethesda's games usually do, nothing gamebreaking has happened to me so far.  All things considered the game is fun after you get used to the clunky follower AI and such, so I'd still recommend it.",

Only skill that affects dialogue is Charisma, and even then it mostly only affects how much extra money you get from quests.   Gameplay elements however were improved somewhat. Although you can feel how the engine behind it is getting old. The new base building is fresh and welcome addition, but ends up being pretty meaningless and not used much.    Only thing that can bring life back to this game is mods and hopefully some good dlc. However until such happens I can't recommend this game at full price, maybe not even at half price since season pass is costy. They haven't even released creation kid for modders yet.

            "review_text": "I must first by stating for the record I am old, retired in 2001. I got Fallout 4 when Steam released it in November of 2015. Since that time I have managed to date 2,389 hours. Yup, you read that right, nearly 2,400 hours. Check my Steam Profile for proof. I have been planning to wait to review this game until I had 2,500 hours. But the resent hate monguring by some have forced me to rethink that. Also I have never played any of the other Fallout games. But I have other games by Bethesda, which I also enjoy.  But here is my review of Fallout 4 by Bethesda.  This game rocks! The ability to go ninja or rambo is just so much fun. I perfer ninja, silent and deadly. This game offers up some of the best visuals I have seen in a while. It draws you in, makes you feel like your the lone survivor. I'v played other games before, like GTA/SA, which I also truly loved for that open sandbox world feel. To be able to go where you want, when you want, that is jsut so cool.  Being able to build settlements, to help rebuild the future from the ashes of yesterday. That is so cool. You get to control how the basic's of a settlement are run, setup defenses, walls, protect your settlers, make them happy and they will defend the settlement almost without you.  The game mechanic's in my view, are absolute beautiful. Sneaking, sniping, swimming, this game just offers so much. I just wish one thing you could have, is a cart or a pack animal to carry stuff when doing resource gathering. But other than that, I am telling you, from someone who has been around since before video games were even thought of, this is just so much fun. The music fits the feel as well.   Truly a masterpiece of game development. I wish more games had that special something that draws you in, makes you forget the real world for a time. This game does have 1 small issue that I have never liked. Forced mission setup. Though the world is totally open like a wonderful sandbox game. If you get too close to a mission location or item, it auto triggers the mission. This I wish was not the case. I wish I could play this without having to do missions all the time. Just to survive in the wasteland of the Commonwealth. Again that is my only complaint about Fallout 4.  Visually it's an easy 10.  Game play, a good solid 9,  Game concept a massive 10,  Game mechanic's, IE building and fighting, a ultra massive 10.  Game enviroment another easy 10.  Game NPC's, this area needs some work, so I give it a good 7. Game mission layout, another area that could have been better so I give it another 7.  For the overall preformance and function, I give Fallout 4 a solid 9.4   It's one of the absolute best games out there, but could have had some things done a touch better. I believe Bethesda has truly done an absolutely fantastic job. I can not wait for the next installment of the Fallout universe. I can only hope that they continue the franchise with something so massive, so fun, so perfect.  Yes I own all the DLC for Fallout 4 and I do NOT use mod's. I highly highly recommend this game to those who enjoy playing alone, who enjoy an emersive role playing game. And as someone who played the original Drungeon's &amp; Dragons, not AD&amp;D, the first one. I know what a true RPG is, and Fallout 4 is the video game variant of it.

            "review_text": "First some quick background information: I've played nearly all the Fallout games, except for two of the spin-off games. Usually I play through the game and thereafter I often immediately start the game over again, just to approach the gameplay from another angle, like making a character that is constricted to only using some type of weaponry, or making a character that has a set of completely different skills from the last one. This has always given me a fun and rewarding experience with the prior games, as a lot differs in gameplay depending on how you create and develop your character. With Fallout 4, aforementioned experience isn't really there. Why is this then?  The most important aspect to this is, as many others also seems to feel, the removal of the skill system in Fallout 4. Instead we only get a version of the perk system which in earlier games worked as, by giving an example, a sort of flavour to the main dish (with the main dish being skills). They weren't crucial for the gameplay, but they made character development much more fun and intricate. So, in Fallout 4 we have the spices, but we don't really get to enjoy the main dish. And who wants to eat only salt and pepper?  A character which has inherent strenghts and flaws, which you usually had in the former games due to the need to tag certain skills over others and invest your limited SPECIAL points, were what according to me made the earlier games so rewarding to play. In Fallout 4 your character can quickly become a Jack of all Trades, or a Wasteland Superman, due to the ability boost your SPECIAL scores can get every single time you gain a level. Imagine a person running around with huge muscles, incredible smarts, great perception, super luck and a devilishly charming behaviour. Those people doesn't really exist in the real world (even if we would hope so) and feel more like they belong in an ancient Greek myth. Therefore, in a game striving for some sort of realism, a sense of alienation can easily hit the player when the character without ease can transitition into a demi-god.  Overall, many things in Fallout 4 feels spoon-fed or dumbed down for the enjoyment of purely action-oriented players. Sure, you need fusion cores for the operation of your power-suit, but (spoilers) you still get a power-suit in the first hour of gameplay. In the earlier games it usually took a long time getting a power-suit or really good gear, making the obtainment of said things much more rewarding for the player. This is also apparent with the companions in Fallout 4, as (spoilers again) you receive a couple of them after only hours of gameplay. They aren't really that hard to recruit either, mostly they just seem to be like: 'Yeah sure I'll go with you, I have nothing to do anyway'. In Fallout NV you get more memorable quests for recruiting companions, like (spoilers) finding the murderer of Boones wife before he joins you. Conclusively it can be said that making a game easier might not make it more fun.   I also have some more technical concerns with the game, as for example the UI is a hassle to have to deal with and feels less intuitive than its counterpart in Fallout 3 and NV. The building system, while it can be fun and a real timekiller, really needs to be overlooked and be made more manageable.   Fallout 4 nevertheless has some positive sides. Graphics and physics have had a major improvement since the older games (while they still are not excellent now either, mind you). Combat overall feels less stiff. The addition of the more complex crafting and armor systems are interesting and give the game some much needed depth and complexity. The voice-acting is also mostly pretty good. Characters don't really look like mannequins anymore either, which I know Bethesda has gotten a lot of critique for concerning their earlier games.  All in all though, Fallout 4's flaws seem to outweigh its strenghts. A watered down role-playing element, where the removal of skills seems to be the most important factor, in combination with providing the players everything in the game too easily and too fast made Fallout 4 one of the more disappointing experiences I've had in the Fallout universe. It is a shame however, since there is a good game underneath the pile of all the bad things. Therefore, I would recommend buyers to refrain from buying Fallout 4 now and wait until it gets cheaper or on sale.       ",

I suppose it is an easy way to make a buck but to me they completely wasted a great opportunity of making a great game which most knew and loved.

This means that if you want to play a charismatic character, which is also basically pointless now as anyone could succed with enough trys, or care at all about the conversations or how characters interact then you need to remenber to save BEFORE TALKING TO ANYONE so you can reload when you fail to convice some shumck to be less of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.

Like every Bethesda game, it offers a rich universe with plenty to do, and has a few moments of grace that probably make up for all of its problems.  Like every Bethesda game, the vanilla experience is broken, and you need mods to get something good out of it. Install the 'full dialogue interface' mod that allows you to select full lines rather than just a single word, this will completely change your experience. Also, don't play a male character. The voice actor is okay but far below the voice actress in terms of talent. You can even change your gender in a current game by using a console command, so there's no reason not to try it.  Other mods I'd recommend installing: custom enemy respawn timer (I set it to no respawns, don't judge me), satellite world map (so you can actually make sense out of dense urban areas), no settlement attacks (guys, if I give you what you need in defense points, why do you still need my help?), and 'shut up Preston', because radiant quest are evil, don't even bother with them.  Also, Fallout 3 is the game that single-handedly made me like jazz (especially Billie). Considering I can't live without having music playing at all time, that's a massive feat. Fallout 4 re-uses most of the Fallout 3 radio songs (while adding a few good new tracks), so that's a great thing for me. New Vegas had a much less interesting selection, for instance.  While The Witcher 3 gets my vote for RPG of the year (and quite possibly of all time), Fallout 4 is the perfect opposite experience, but it shares the same love for its lore and love of exploration.

Created a new one, and decided that I would roleplay the **** out of this story. That helped.   - The world is filled with baddies And I do mean, to the brim. They are everywhere. A gang of raiders.

I've tinkered with it enough to know their strengts and all -    but for the love of some deity -   CAN I JUST PLEASE EXPLORE A LITTLE BEFORE THEY ALL START SHOOTING AT ME!  And that's my gripe. I can't walk two steps before something tries to kill me. And those bullet spunges just become very, very ... VERY annoying.   - There is no middle ground I would have liked a shade of grey. Just so it would feel more like a slippery slope. Instead it's: Your either with us, or against us. And we're all batcrap crazy.   Those are the three issues I have with the game. You can overcome it by roleplaying what it wants you to be, nuke every nexus of baddies and not commit to anything.   PRO's: I have over 250 hours in the game, so I did like it.   - There are a billion little stories out there, waiting for you to find it - LVL up your character right, and you can custom tailor a playstyle that fits you like a glove  You know what, I'll sum it up: This is a Fallout game. You like Fallout, you're gonna play it.  edit: horrible grammar and spelling. Some fixed. Some not.",

            "review_text": "Is it or isn't it fallout game, that seems to be the question.  I doubt anyone will read this becuase there are almost 20K reviews out there, which shows how popular the franchise is.   I think it is a fallout game hands down, a lot of people are getting really negative about the game and that is their right. It's a little bit of a different set up, VATS doesn't play as strong of a role as it did before, and sometimes it can feel more like you are just plugging away. The combat is interesting, you can pistol whip and do take downs but it does take some time to getting use to. The baddies more so how the ghouls move is cool to watch. I never have been killed as much in a fallout game as this one. It seems a little harder combat wise.  The other big complaint is people not feeling like you aren't chosing your character and you truly aren't making your own story... In fallout 3 you had a clear cut goal, in New Vegas your main goal really could be accomplished in under 5-6 hours, than you chose what group you want to side with or none at all.   Ther has always been some type of a base story plot, you can still chose between male and female and make them look however you want. Perhaps this wouldn't have been such an issue for some people if they gave you a few different voices, but that would have been a nightmare to do because there is a lot of dialouge. Plus the voice acting is great. Nothing is really taken away from making it your own.   In the end they tried something a little different from fallout3 and New Vegas but in the same realm. Most of the negative reviews seem to focus on the differences between F4 and fallout 3/Vegas. At the same time I think people would have been just as negative if they didn't change up the combat system or try something new with the perks.   As far as clitches, 3-5 times in almost 21 hours of playing the game froze or closed out. Actually I believe at least once it was because steam wanted to update, and of course like any of the other fallout games I jumped and got stuck some play. This is very mild, more so for a brand new game that hit PC and started up with out a hitch.  I'm really enjoying this game.    ",

            "review_text": "Fallout 4.   When i first purchased this game when it came out, I was surprised by how well it ran at release. Very rarely had i encountered a game breaking bug, glitches or crashes, but the performance was awful. You had to change settings in .ini files to turn off FPS lock and other stuff like FOV. There isn't even a Brightness setting in the game and the game just has weird Shadow setting problems. It got better with patches, but it can still run like crap at times even with beast PC's. Time for a new engine Bethesda.  1.The story itself isn't that good, full of plot holes and just another 'Find a family member' boring crap all over again. Bethesda should fire their writer and get a better one. Progressing through the story, you can't even tell the companions about what you found in the institute, you can't tell Piper that she was right about Mayor being a synth, and there are way more examples. The dialouge is awful, the conversation wheel and voiced protagonist just suck. It's pretty hard (if possible at all) to be an evil character. You can ignore the main quest, go exploring and be an ♥♥♥ to people, but once you get back into the main quest, you are forced to be good, very rarely can you say no and sarcastic options can really suck at times. You are forced to join the Minutemen and quickly become a General. The game just has very limited options, no matter what Faction you join, the ending is the same. You can't talk your way out of fights, for example Kellogg, there was so much they could do with him, but he is just another bad guy. Most NPC's are invincible in the story (Surprisingly, the first time you meet Shaun, he isn't.) The story, choices and dialogue are just bad.  2.Voice acting is better this time, but you can still find NPC's that sound the same. I think Brian Delaney and Courtney Taylor did a good job here, but i prefer Courtney. Even then, at times, the characters, both male and female, can sound boring, like they don't care, some lines sound better on Male, others on Female.   3.The Dialouge system is a disaster. Mass effect copy which is even worse, and you can't say no most of the time, you are forced to be good. Very rare speech checks, that just are there to get more caps. Some sarcastic options aren't even sarcastic. You don't know what your character is going to say (unless you use a mod). A good example:  'Talking to some NPC, giving you another kill, loot, return quest' 1. Ask a question? 2. Yes 3. Sarcastic (Yes) 4. No (Yes)  4.The companions are pretty good, they can get involved in conversations, have some sort of a story behind them, some of them have quests. But that's it. Companion affinity sucks, Piper likes lockpicking, pick locks all the time and she falls in love with you....yeah.. Their AI can suck at times, setting off traps, or alert enemies to you while sneaking. You can't talk to them about things that happened when you beat the story. After you gain max affinity, they get boring. Lone Wanderer perk is great!  5.Factions are pretty good, but again, you are forced to join the Minutemen and become a General. The Brotherhood of Steel kind of makes sense this time, of course Liberty Prime had to come back...Instead of keeping the institue tech, they destroy it, yeah, that is surely preserving technology, so we get another Megaton 2.0 explosion. (Thank god you don't become the leader). Institue is bad, you are forced to be the next leader, because Shaun is dying of cancer. (They have advanced tech, they can create human synths, cure for Super Mutants but not cancer) they could have been better, but it's a mess, full of plotholes. The Railroad feel like Thieves Guild from Skyrim, i just kill them all the time.   6.The gameplay is better than previous Fallout games, combat feels better, weapon mods. Power Armor actually feels like one this time, but it's so easy to find them, (you get one first hour into the game) and the stupid fusion cores. The commonwealth feels great to explore, still finding hidden items and new locations 700+ hours in.  There are things to do. It looks great, feels more alive, where every few steps there is a fight going on. (But the AI still sucks at times). Some big weapons suck, like the Minigun.    7.Animations are pretty bad, male character run animations makes him look like he crapped himself, and they just feel fake. Talking to people that are sleeping, they have to get out of the bed first, then engage in a conversation, you can't talk to them while they are getting up (yet that was possible in Skyrim). Weapon holsters are gone, weapons just disappear into thin air, probably because of the Armor System and all the weapon mods, but New Vegas did fine with it. Overall animations feel fake and robotic.  8.Graphics are good, but God Rays look awful, you have to set to Very High to get rid of those jaggies at the cost of very big performance which isn't worth it. Some places look beautiful and they finally got rid of that damn green tint.  9.Replayability, there is none in terms of story. There is some however, if you want to ignore the main quest and do a different build. Different approaches to combat like stealth, melee, unarmed, sniper build only etc.. but even then, the SPECIAL system can make you a god every time, unless you limit yourself to perks.   10.The settlement building is okay i guess, if you have nothing else to do and feel bored, you can build something nice. But i feel like Bethesda could have focused more on making more towns with their own stories, characters and quests instead of settlement building.   11.The new perk system is just awful. The removal of skills was bad. No level cap means you can grind your way to become a god with all SPECIAL stats maxed and perks (some of which are useless). Level scaling sucks, the more you level, the less damage you do, the more health enemies get, the longer and boring fights get, no matter the difficulty, but that is at very high levels, but still inevitable (unless you use mods).  Where Bethesda did good in Gameplay and Exploration, they failed at Story Telling, Choices and Consequences. The game feels rushed that was made in a few months, rather than a few years. Everything feels rushed, slapped on at the last minute, even breaking some of the lore, 'even bethesda's added lore from Fallout 3'. The DLC isn't that great either, Far Harbor was okay, but felt like Point Lookout 2.0 and more synths. Automatron, 1-2 hour story and you can build your own robots. The workshop DLC's are just a disaster and pointless. I've yet to play Nuka World.  Overall, the game is good, (not a good Fallout game) i like it, i always heavily mod Bethesda games to keep playing and make them better, it has it's flaws, it's playable, but it's the worst Fallout game yet and DLC Season Pass is a disaster. Fallout 4 feels Skyrimized. If you are a big Fallout fan you will be really disappointed. Go back to Morrowind RPG days Bethesda, take examples from Obsidian, make an actual Fallout RPG or Fallout 5 will be a linear shooter with no choices and a story focused looking for your Mother or Sister that were kidnapped.   I recommend the game to people who like Open World exploration, heavy modding, minecraft building and offline MMO grinding style. If you are looking for a good story with choices, consequences and role-playing, you won't find it here.  ",

            "review_text": "I find that Fallout 4 is a fun game but does differ from its predecessors and not necessarily in good ways. Much of the criticism you read in the other reviews on here are valid. Though, I still give this game a positive rating because I have had fun playing it. Superficially it's a great game but it's lacks a certain degree in substance.   Let's first talk about the differences and things I have not liked... All the dialogue boils down to either a yes or a no. You might be shown 4 lines which might branch out to a few more but it's just a ruse. Not to mention the horrific summarized sentences which come down to 1-3 words. And the dreaded 'sarcastic' option which you don't know if is an actual lighthearted joke, cruel insult, or a cheesy one-liner. Luckily one of the most popular mods is one which shows the full sentences beforehand.  Quests - Another thing I really hated is how you can approach quests--or the lack there off. Many side-quests and others can only be started one way. Quest in New Vegas could be started through a number of ways, either you talk to someone involved, you're exploring and the quest gets triggered, or someone runs up to you and starts talking which might as well tie into my first example but point being there were multiple ways quests could start.   Lack of play-style/character focus - New Vegas allowed you to make a very focused character build--cowboy, stealth intruder, riflemen, etc. In Fallout 4 doesn't have that, of course you can play whichever way you want it's just that there's nothing forcing nor limting you. After you've played enough and gotten enough points you can max out all the perks, there's no limit. Though, this seems to be a Bethesda style since Fallout 3 had this as well while New Vegas didn't which was made by Obsidian.   Morality - This game does not have a morality system which designates you either good or bad depending on your actions. It was a solid part in the previous games and effected how others interacted with you. Nor can you have varies levels of association with factions. You're either in or you're out.   Subway - I really found the lack of a interconnected subway system disappointing. I loved exploring the subway tunnels in Fallout 3--they added so much more. Fallout 4 does have subway stations but they're not connected or vast.  Now somethings which I like...  Graphics - The visual quality is better than previous games in the series. You have very nice lighting, better textures, better models, etc. Mods such as True Storms really improve on the vanilla weather with heavier rain, heavy fog which looks great, and my favorite being heavy rad/rain storms. Some badly taken, unflattering screenshots might tell the contrary but honestly the game does look great. Many times I just roam around looking at the scenery.  Weapons and Combat - Weapons are a mixed bag, you can mod them quite heavy but there aren't a whole lot of them. There really could have been more along with different 'pipe rifles' which was a taken on handmade guns made by wastelanders. For weapons which were made with different scraps and whatnot it really makes no sense why they're standardized and all yellow! That said, weapons handle great, and can be modded for a wide range of situations. It was really fun making an automatic laser shotgun. Fallout 4 is a great shooter and has great combat. Controls work as they should, firefights get intense with the better effects, etc.   Level design - In many places I've found skeletons step up in ways to portray a story, the person was trying to get into somewhere, a fight was happening, or just something goofy. It's interesting to look at your surroundings and see what had happened there. Along with that Boston and it's surrounding areas are well built and fun to explore.   Modding - Modding is a big part of the game. Nexus has a ton of great mods and it would be shame if you didn't try them out.   Overall, I find that Fallout 4 is a fun game worth around $25-$35--including the DLCs. With more and more games trying to appeal to a wider audience at the cost of a quality game, Fallout 4 has managed to remain a decent game and has suffered somewhat from this mentality.",

However the dialogue in this game was extremely dissapointing, speech and the non existent karma system really lower the experience over the other fallout games. In previous games speech as well as your skill sets would allow you to open up tons of dialogue options depending on how you built you character. Fallout 4 has done away with that and speech is mostly only used for bargaining for some extra caps, with the rare actually meaningful decision swayer. Dialogue really consist of 3 options, the good, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and the kidder thats your dialogue options, really only how you want to say what they want you to say not actually choosing what you want to say. All that considered though the game is still very good, full of content and hours of fun.

Bethesda improved greatly on the graphics of the game, as well as massively improved on the gun-play mechanics and made using the weapons very fluid and methodical. The crafting system is interesting, but not perfect, and the settlemnet building system is really fun, for the right kind of player.  All in all, in the interest of keeping the review short, I love the game for what it is instead of trash it becuase it isn't similar to the past entries to the franchise. Play the game like it's Fallout 4, not Fallout 3, and you'll have a better experience, I guarantee it.

Perhpas it needs sause? maybe some bread? beans too... And then you get the full english! FALLOUT 4 is a potential FULL ENGLISH. When the DLC's hit, and the modding communtiy gets it hands on teh geck? I think FALLOUT 4 will out do New vegas hands down. WIth the bases building, the fact that water combat can and WILL happen. The fact that now weapon modding is acctually a CORE component to the game play? and armour modding? you know its going to outdo even everyones fav ♥♥♥♥♥ witcher 3. It sounds like i dislike fallout 4. No, i see it for what it is. Bacon. Its great. it just has more potential later on. I wud recommend modding new vegas, till the mod scene and dlc's hit for fallout 4. seriously.   ",

            "review_text": "I have clocked in more than 300 hours in Fallout 4, so I feel qualified to write this review now:  If you are expecting a game that plays like Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, you may end up disappointed. Somewhere along the lines (while they were ripping off the parts of Mass Effect that I HATED the most), Bethesda seems to have forgotten that this franchise is supposed to be an RPG, or 'Roleplaying Game'.  In truth, besides picking your character's name, gender, customizing their looks with one of THE least intuitive face sculpting tools I have EVER seen, you are presented with VERY few opportunities or situations where you actions have consequences, or change how the rest of the game plays out.  Allow me to explain: apart from the 'picking a side' aspect that they ripped off from Fallout: New Vegas, very few quests present you, the player, with alternatives that affect how the quest ends. Part of this may be due to the removal of the skills that all Fallout games have had since Fallout 1 so many years ago, but rarely do you decisions mean anything. The quests are very linear, and rarely are you given an alternative method of completing them.  Additionally, there are very few REAL quests. There are about 10,000 radiant quests, that consist of 'go to X location and kill X enemy', but thinking back now, besides the faction-specific portions of the main quests, I can only think of maybe 15 real side quests that did not follow the formula I mentioned above.  Another major sticking point: Exploration. While the infinitely repeating radiant quests seem specifically designed to introduce you, the player, to a location you haven't visited yet, there is very little in trying to explore anything that doesn't have a map marker. Gone are the fun, hard to fine unmarked locations with hilarious easter eggs or unique loot - there really just isn't... any of that. I am an avid free-roaming explorer, and I was disappointed that so much of the unmarked space was so... empty and meaningless. Sure, they remember to toss some random static objects around, but nothing you can collect, nothing that is a challenge to locate and thus gives a sense of achievement for finding it.  The underwater sections are the worst part of the free-roaming exploration aspect - do not even bother looking for stuff underwater. Even if there is a sunken ship, it will not have ANY loot in in. I kept a tally, and the number of actual lootable objects I found in the underwater sections of the exterior worldspace was 8! And every single one of them was very much so in the open and trivially easy to spot, further cheapening any actual sense of meaningful accomplishment for finding it...  Now, of the new features Fallout 4 was so eager to tote, let's begin with base building. Yes, it is very fun - at first. Once you realize there are very view actual set pieces for you to build with, and that the collision on them is so buggy that you can rarely actually build what YOU want with them, it starts to feel very hollow. Furthermore, as the world opens up and you are given more settlements to babysit, it starts to become too much to handle. I started groaning whenever I was given a new settlement, and why? Because you are now under the obligation to maintain it, and defend it. So that just meant another hour of my time setting up the same prefab setup of defenses, crops, beds, and water supply that I used for every base I did not actually care about.  Furthermore, do not be fooled into thinking that the bases can fend for themselves. You will randomly get messages saying 'X settlement is under attack!', and at that point, you MUST drop everything and go help. It doesn't matter if the settlement being attacked is armed with 10,000 missile turrets and a squad of guards wearing top of the line Power Armor and Gatling Lasers, because of you don't show up, the game just rolls a RNG and 'decides' how much of you stuff to blow up, regardless of any other factors. So even if you are 5 loading screens down, balls deep in a dungeon, be prepared to drop everything you are doing and make a mad dash for the settlement that's being attacked. I properly defended all my settlements, so 100% of the time when I was finished 'warping in' (fast traveling), the 'attack' was already over and I had 'won' before the screen even finished loading in, and the attackers were nothing more than bloody smears on the cement...  Moving onto the second toted feature: gun mods. I will admit these were also fun - at first. Very quickly, however, I realized that in total, there were about 20 guns and melee weapons in Fallout 4, and while sure you can use weapon mods to make them behave a bit differently, that's just too damn few. I quickly grew bored of every gun, and could not use the strategy I used for previous Fallout games when this happened (go grab a new gun mod to try), because even at the time of writing, we (the modders) still haven't decoded the game enough to be able to add new unique weapons or armors to the game, and this has nothing to do with the delay of the CK/GECK (which still won't be released for several months at least), but because of all the changes that Bethesda made to the .nif systems (which they would not tell us about even after the tools have been released, as Bethesda has not released their true modding suite of dev tools since flipping Morrowind, relying on the community to come up with 3rd party hack tools to add new models to the game).  And finally, I would like to mention how much recycling Bethesda did of previous game's asserts. While I know that Todd Howard said that Fallout 4 began with a port of Skyrim to the Xbone, the sheer number of reused assets is rather disappointing, and quite galling. Want an easy to spot example? The 'wild dogs' use the ENTIRE Skyrim wolf sound set - from breathing, to walking, to attacking, to death sounds - it's all EXACTly 110% the same, with ZERO changes. So many environment assets were ported directly from Fallout 3/Fallout: New Vegas as well, without even bothering to give them an HD makeover, so they look jarringly low poly and generally low grade, and clash with the rest of the environment. And the creatures? Once I thought about it, I had a hard time coming up with a SINGLE creature that didn't either use a Skyrim creature's skeleton rigging and animations, or was just ported from Fallout 3/New Vegas:  Deathclaws? Werewolves. Molerats? Skeevers. Blood bugs? Chaurus Hunters. Yao Guai? Bears (also with a 100% Skyrim sound set and additional NO MODEL CHANGES AT ALL - just some texture swaps ffs!). Radstags? Elk/Deer. All the robots? Fallout 3/New Vegas ports (besides maybe the new assultrons, but they just use humanoid rigging anyways). Bloatflies? Fallout 3/New Vegas ports. Radscorpions? Fallout 3/New Vegas ports. Mirelurks? Fallout 3/New Vegas imports. Mirelurk Kings? Fallout 3/New Vegas imports. Super Mutant Behemoths? Giants. Super Mutants? Fallout 3/New Vegas ports with a few 'tweaks'.  The only exceptions I can think of are the Radroaches, which at least had new attack animations made for them (although the rest of their rigging and animations are Fallout 3/New Vegas imports), and the Mirelurk Hunters, which look like they use a modified Mudcrab rig with a few new animations.  And then there's the sheer number of humanoid animations that are COMPLETELY identical to the ones created for Skyrim, such as the ones for sitting down or a chair, or lying down onto a bed, etc.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So do I recommend this game? Well, tentatively 'yes', but only because it's still better than most of the garbage coming out lately (and when/if modding *FINALLY* gets released, there will be a lot of well made mods to add content to it, as always).  But you are honestly better off just playing Fallout: New Vegas to be perfectly honest...",

            "review_text": "First of all, Fallout 4 isn't a bad game. It's just not a fallout game. At first everything seems alright, the character creator is nice, the graphics are decent enough and the voice actors are pretty believable too. But once you rise up out of your vault 200 years later the problems start to make themselves known.  First, the character never says exactly what your dialogue choices are, leading to some very overly harsh responses.  Second, the customisation needed far more options. Instead we got that most melee weapons have two or three upgrades, most guns have a few upgrades per category with some being just a repeat of previous upgrade with something ridiculous like extra reload speed when nothing would visually indicate such a thing. The armor customisation works...but that doesn't mean it's good. Everything feels the same, save for any item you might pick up that's legendary. Most clothing items can't be upgraded like your armor or weapons making wearing anything other than your vault suit essentially pointless.  And third is the NPCs. Between bugs (to be expected, but not to be forgiven) making people vanish and just insane reactions or lack thereof this game's NPCs are atrocious when in motions. Let's be honest here people, releasing a game where game breaking quest bugs are occurring at launch is inexcusable, even for a game this big. The game's main story should at the least have been tested hard enough to ensure no bugs were present that culd halt progression. That aside, most NPC's are frighteningly unresponsive. I'll give you an example: I waltzed into a certain location where people wore blue and yellow jumpsuits. I found a family and followed them into their room where I killed the father who was under suspicion of wronging his family. I decide to wait until the next morning, leaving the body of the decapitated man bleeding on the floor. The next morning the wife doesn't even act like her husband was killed and the dialogue option regarding him is just gone. Even SKYRIM had more reactive NPCs than this!   Son in conclusion...this game is okay. It's even fun exploring around and finding yourself in a tight spot where you don your power armor and wade into combatto ensure victory, but it's not fallout. I recommend the game, but I don't recommend you look at it as fallout. It's more like a game glazed in fallout.  P.S. And I'm not even going to touch on the skills/perks debacle.",

I bought NV, which I heard was the best, but it would not launch. After an hour or so I refunded it and got Fallout 2, which I heard was second. I've logged only 3 hours on F2, so cut me slack if I slip up, but I wanted to see what it was like. Honestly, I do not understand the hate this game is getting, but let's look at the Pros and Cons. Cons first.  Cons:   Much weaker story compared to 1, 2 and NV (Not 3, I think they are about tied). I mean, why exactly did they kidnap the kid and keep me alive? Maybe I'm a dumbass but I never understood why my child was targeted, or how the institue found out about him. And the whole revenge story. I couldn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥ about it, but I guess there's nothing to do about that. I'm just a sociopath.  The dialogue wheel and main character voice actor really, really ruined it. What happened to you being able to, well, be YOU? I feel like I'm in control of this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ from time to time and at other times I'm watching a movie. The voice actors were terrific, but just detracted from the experience. Hell, there were times I went for the sarcastic option thinking I'd say yes, but said no sarcastically. And vice-versa. I mean, what's the point if I don't even know what I'm going to say?  Pros:  Almost everything else. As far as raw gameplay goes, this is easily the best game in the series. 115 or so hours in and I'm still having a ball. Wearing power armour is so much fun, and you get to treat it like your PC or Car, adding cool mods and changing what version it is. You can also mod weapons and armour. All in all the crafting system is tremendous. The companions actually interact with their environments and have personality and a story. They did in Vegas, but they are far more personable and feel a little less like a talking pack mule (still are though).There are plenty of fun side quests like the U.S.S. Constitution, Secret of Cabot House, and the Lost Patrol. The combat system is heavily improved from others. All in all, definitely worth my money.  EDIT: Just started playing NV. Most of what I say still stands.",

Plenty of missions to do for various factions and options in some missions to alter the outcome of the mission. A good amount of companions to travel with and having different abilities.  I've found that there are stories that tie into others even though you aren't given missions for them.

It simplifies a lot of the skill and levelling system--which in and of itself isn't too bad, but it leaves a lot of the perks as being '+x% damage with y weapons' instead of allowing for more interesting augments. My biggest issue is that removing the skills system means the removal of skill checks. I found one set during the quest line on the USS Constitution where you can bypass some fetch quests with a high enough intelligence, but so far that't the only one. Skill checks were some of the best parts of Fallout 3 and New Vegas stories, building a character a certain way and seeing a conversation option preceded by [Your Main Skill: XX] and getting either extra stuff or bypassing annoying stuff. And seeing checks for skills your current character isn't built for paves the way for replayability--'I couldn't pass this [Small Guns] check this time, maybe my next character will be a pistol-packing mama instead of a minigun monster' kind of stuff. And the multi-threaded endings to not just the main quest but a lot of side quests meant that replaying the game wasn't just hitting the same plot points with slightly different dialogue.   Those are my most significant complaints about the game, but those are complaints about it's status as a Fallout game. Taken on its own, it's a good game. Plenty of action, several ways to approach combat, enough variety in gear (though I do hope future expansions add more than just one piece per category) and mods to keep things from going totally stale, and an interesting world worth exploring. Fallout 4 misses out on a lot of the 'zany' events and stuff that the previous games had, but there are a lot of kind of interesting little stories being told with the junk scattered through the Commonwealth. I found a prisoner's skeleton near a pole in a police station, with the hand separated and a pair of handcuffs between them, implying this person was cuffed during the explosion, maybe survived, and tried to escape by going all 127 Hours on their arm. I also found a pair of teddy bears in a Raider camp set up to look like one was doing surgery on the other. Creepy-cute.   All in all, Fallout 4 is a good game that misses a lot of what makes Fallout games great. Here's hoping Far Harbor, the first major campaign DLC, will address some of the most glaring omissions like a lack of skill checks",

Don't expect step function improvement in graphics or gameplay from the the previous works. It builds on them, increasing density of foes and setting, and improving on presentation and atmosphere, while retaining the essence of what made it great.    Many view this as a negative, thats its not some new, mind altering experience. In my opinion, thats like saying 'oh, just another Rembrandt, only an evolution on masterpiece. Been there, done that. Ho hum.' Many seem to have viewed Fallout 4 with totally unrealistic expectations of better than ever before. It is solid, great art. The attention to detail, the retention of what was fun while adding activities like the base building that have absorbed my interest for many game hours, the storytelling that had nuanced, emotional content that many seem to have bounced off of, a world that is more engaging than ever.    I see those who are bent on being chaotic destructionists that are disappointed. That doesn't bother me. So many times people want license to be the antisocial chaotic evil destroyer anti-hero. I don't have a problem that this possible but not supported well in the game. There is enough nihilism in real life, and not enough heroics, so facilitating you taking a stand for believing in something more than you and making a difference is welcome. In my opinion the storytelling, the art, the archetypes and epitomes of epic mythos provided on an open world platform are inspiring.    Yes, I would have liked to have provided more of my personal flavor of leadership on my faction's choices, but that also is reflective of constraints requiring compromise in the world. That is one of the few things I think could have been improved - through great effort, further influencing my faction towards my personal world vision. Maybe thats a goal for Fallout 5.",

            "review_text": "Just a quick note: I own none of the DLC This game was in development for so long, and somehow it still feels incomplete. Oh, sure you can build up your settlements, have crops and defense and structures, but most of the time it's just downright frustrating to do any of that. There's no grid to snap walls, floors, or anything to. The only time they snap is to another wall or floor, and why is it that cables have this predetermined curve to them, causing them to sometimes be unplaceable because the curve passes through the ground or something when in reality that's not at all what would happen? And why when I'm building can't I float around like I've turned off collision so I don't have to build a set of stairs just to be able to put something up on a roof?  The variety of enemies from previous titles is gone. New Vegas gave the player a vast and easily encountered number of different factions. In Fallout 4, the majority of enemy factions basically comes down to Ghouls, (which the game even sometimes reminds the player during a random loading screen are not zombies) Super Mutants, and Raiders. Occasionally, the player will have to deal with Gunners and during the more story-driven quests, Synths, but that's about it. Those are the most common enemies in the game, and they're the most common by quite a lot.  Of course, it's possible this wouldn't be so bothersome if it weren't for the fact that by its own design, the game forces these enemy factions to be encountered extremely often. There is an abysmal amount of side quests in this game, as it seems instead focus has been placed on giving the player repeatable quests to either defend a settlement by building up its defenses, help a settlement get one of its members back after they were kidnapped, usually by a settlement of Raiders somewhere, clear out a location filled with Ghouls, or stop Super Mutants from raiding a settlement again by clearing them out of a location, too. Wash, rinse, repeat, indefinitely. When I walked onto a pier and randomly discovered the 'Here There Be Monsters' quest I nearly cried at the thought of being able to do something other than clear out a dungeon.  The skill system has been absolutely decimated. There are no more skills. Now there are only perks. One weakness I've found of the Fallout games has always been that they never really hammer home any sense of really building your character into one specific thing. You have the ability to put points into whatever skills you want, resulting in just making your character generally better at everything. Some people really like this, and I can understand that completely, but never was the problem with this system so glaring until now. Skills have turned into perks, and also perks are still perks. The Guns skill has now been broken up and scattered all over the tree into several different perks, whereas before there were not only perks relating to guns, but a skill designated for them, too. Some of these new perks, however, are just completely pointless. Lockpicking, for example, progresses exactly as it used to, except now, because everything is locked to a certain level, it's impossible to be able to open master locks until a certain level is achieved, which makes no sense and makes the whole system feel incredibly watered down. In previous games, you could just max out any skill as quickly as you desired. It makes leveling feel unrewarding as your choices in what you can do have become way more limited.  One positive thing I'd like to mention is the very creative way that junk works. You can now pick up pretty much any item you find and sell it or store it at a workbench and use its base materials to help you build things around your settlements. It's a very nice way to give a bit more interactivity to the world the player is in, as it allows you to do more with those objects than just pick them up and toss them around.  Overall, despite everything I've said, this is still a fun game, though I can't really play it for many hours at a time due to the never-ending bombardment of settlement quests. The weapon and armor customization is really good, though it is annoying being forced to wait until a certain level so the next rank of the armorer or science perk can be met in order to do more things with the customizing. The story isn't half bad, even if it is a bit short, and the outside environments are fantastic as long as you don't look to closely at them. However, I still can't recommend this game, for the detailed reasons above, as well as some other minor things (unfinished roofs, building textures warping into each other, the super mutants voices have somehow gotten even more irritating, etc.). Hopefully the next Fallout will be able to fix at least some of these problems.",

            "review_text": "So I've been waiting years for this game to come out. I have collectively put hundreds of hours into both Fallout 3 and NV (between PC and console), and I can say this: Fallout 4 is different than both of those games. Now, 'different' is the same as 'bad', don't mistaken me.  Short Review: Fallout 4 is an amazing game and I love it. Yes, there are many many differences, but also a lot of things they kept the same. These differences can be both good and bad, but I believe that the goods outweigh the bads. Many new customization and modding aspects, and I also found combat to be more challenging, but also more in depth and a little strategic. In all, it's an amazing game and Fallout 4 has not disappointed me.   Long Review: To start: The combat is different. It's no longer standing in the same spot or strafing back and forth going in and out of VATS. It's now more in depth. I often found myself hiding behind cover and being more strategic. Even the enemies are more strategic with their encounters (well.. it depends on who you're fighting. Ghouls still just run at you frantically).  Crafting is fun. It's not a highlight of the game, but it's fun to take a break from the fighting (which has prove - in my case - to be a challenge, at least in the beginning of the game) to do something a lot more passive.  And also modding weapons and armor is also a really nice feature. Being able to get a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ weapon and turn it into something amazing is always really enjoyable. Even if you're modding amazing weapons into SUPER amazing weapons is always nice. I really enjoyed the ability to do that.  VATS is different as well, as you've probably heard. Time doesn't freeze, but goes slow motion. Which I do like for the most part. There are a few perks that go with it, (perk spoiler) including one where you can see the weaknesses of the enemy in VATS.  You can finally sprint in Fallout! So sprinting uses AP points (which are quickly regenerated).  The health system is different now, too. So as you get radiation (when you eat radiated food or water or if you stand next to a toxic waste barrel), your max health goes down. This DOES make the game more challenging. In fact, I've found Fallout 4 to be a more challenging game compared to 3 and NV.  Power Armor is no longer armor that you find and wear. You get it really early in the game and it's used almost as a weapon. Each piece of the suit (helmet, torso, left leg, right leg, left arm right arm) have their own conditions and in battle, they can break; however it's easy to repair them later on. You also can upgrade your Power Armor throughout the game as well, to have better stats, resistance, etc.. And they've definitely limited the amount of time you can spend in your suit. You have 'fusion cores' that power the suit, and if your suit runs out of power, you either need another fusion core, or the stats are basically zero (but still wearable).  In regards to Power Armor in combat, I think it's almost necessary. I haven't played a ♥♥♥♥ ton of the game yet, so I haven't come to a definite conclusion yet, but so far I think Power Armor is in place of wearing regular armor. I haven't found a lot of regular armor in the game yet, and the main armor that I have is my Power Armor. Now, I haven't played enough to confirm this.",

If this doesn't win Game of the Year I'd be surprised.  EDIT: Now that I've played 350+ hours of Fallout 4, I can say that although its not a perfect game, it is really good. The only problem I can think of is the lack of side quests and the lack of things to do after you beat the game. After an amazing story the game just leaves you wanting more but not giving it to you. What I do now after I beat the game is I explore the commonwealth, max out my character, and fiddle with settlement building. Some people will hate exploring and settlements and they only want quests which is why they say this game is hollow. These people will just have to wait for DLC or quest mods. All in all, while Fallout 4 could've definitely been better, we have no reason to complain at all with the game Bethesda has given us.  EDIT 2: It's really sad to see that Bethesda will only give us 2 major quest focused DLCs and call it quits after that. Both FO3 and NV had 4 or 5 quest focused DLCs if I remember correctly. Far Harbor was amazing and to know Nuka World is the last DLC for Fallout 4 definitely leaves a bad taste in my mouth. The game and hype was 5 years in the making and to see a game many were hyped for being abandoned after just 1 year of support is just plain disgusting. Bethesda definitely sees FO4 as a failure, but instead of trying to fix their failure they toss it to the side and leave us all to hang. Lost all my respect for Bethesda after this move.

            "review_text": "  What It's Really About   I started out loving this game. The opening of it is just as good as   Fallout 3   and MUCH better than   Fallout: New Vegas   . Then I started noticing little things like the fact the core of the game is centered around building and clearing out the same places over and over again.     City Life      Much like   New Vegas   , with the tantalizing promise of seeing a large, amazing city;   Fallout 4   makes it seem that Diamond City is going to blow your mind, with NPC's actively talking about how it's the biggest city that they've ever seen. Sadly, just like   New Vegas   , it leaves you woefully disappointed and makes you realize that Megaton, the first city that you'll most likely encounter in   Fallout 3   , is still a far better designed city that feels just as big.      Empty Words   It's nice that they added quite a bit of dialogue in this game and that your character actually talks, but rarely does what you same make an impactful change as to what's going on. In fact, most of the time that you're given a choice, 3 out of 4 (sometimes 4 out of 4) of the choices just lead to slightly altered dialogue that has no bearing on the outcome of the conversation. At that point you start to realize that all of the 111,000+ lines of dialogue (According to Bethesda's Twitter account) are just different means to the same end! It really makes you wonder what would have happened if they actually had your choices lead to more impactful decisions. I don't know why they always give you 4 choices when it's not necessary. They should have just given dialogue to more characters instead.    Comparisons and Compromises   Having just graduated with a degree in Game Design, I can honestly tell you that you never get everything you want into a game. I hated that my capstone project turned into what it did. It's been received well, but it's not what I wanted it to be because we didn't have the time. I really hope that this is the case with   Fallout 4   . Bethesda seems to have pushed this out faster than it should have been and I hope that's the case, because this game is severely lacking in content. Missions, characters that talk and just about everything else seems half-finished.     Mission Completed... Already?   Most of the quests feel the same and you may even complete a lot of them (like I did) before you even talk to the quest giver. At that point you just haggle for your payment and tell them that it's already done, which just doesn't seem fulfilling.     How I Long For An Arrow To The Knee   The rule for 99% of NPC's is that if they don't give you a mission or sell you stuff, then they won't converse with you and repeat the same handful of dialogue. Think 'Arrow to the knee' from   Skyrim  , but without the charm.    The Commonwealth; New Area, Same Enemies   Enemy types are largely the same as in Fallout 3, with the Gunners replacing Talon Company and the BoS filling in for the Enclave. At one point you run into 'The Forged', a raider group that primarily uses flame-based weaponry and you think that you'll run into other types of raiders and.... you don't. It feels like an idea the was trashed as soon as they started it, but decided to keep it in anyway. The only new enemies from previous games that I can think of are Blood Bugs, which feel like weaker versions of the Cazadors from   New Vegas   .    Not Bethesda's Fault That We Expected More. They Just Set The Bar Too High   Honestly, I could talk about the faults of this game forever and how it doesn't compare to the Black Isle/Obsidian games, but I still think that it's a good game and a good distraction if you need to feed your yearning for escapism. I want to make it clear that I do not hate this game. I just see more negatives than positives and a regression from the previous games in the series, so I won't recommend it. I just feel like I spent 250 of my logged hours waiting to be rewarded for building up my settlements and scouring the land, but it just never comes.",

Anyway with that in mind, here's my negative review of Fallout Four  Fallout Four is at worst more Fallout, but it is more Fallout at best as well  ♥♥♥♥ I like: Base building Weapon customization New armour system Streamlined cooking Give a home base early on Snow Globes having an actual effect  ♥♥♥♥ I don’t like: Giving the protagonist a voice / backstory is not a problem on the first run through, but later on I will want to play as someone besides a stock white person with a stock accent. Saint’s Row lets you pick between three voices, modulate them, and allows to use the voice of the opposite gender. Com'on Fallout, you’re getting shown up by Saint’s Flippin’ Row The Wild Wasteland perk, faction disguises, Reputation, and other mechanics from New Vegas are gone. I guess you could say... what happened in Vegas, stayed in- alright I'll go away I’ll have to play through New Vegas again but I recall being able to walk five feet in any direction without getting attacked Main menu music is much lamer. Indeed, both the original score and licensed music seem to be lacking, at least when compared to New Vegas and let’s stop beating around the bush, where’s my Dean Martin damn you?!  Barbed Complements The jolly realistic graphics make it more ridiculous when animations ♥♥♥♥ up, the camera clips behind walls. Similarly the jolly pretty water engine makes it more ridiculous when water flows directly out of river banks Lockpicking and hacking remain identical to previous installments Bullet crafting seems to have been removed but I’m not going to cry over that, much as it sucks to no longer be able to load coins into shotgun shells. Come to think of it, faction money seems to have been removed as well, another thing I’m not going to cry over   I guess my biggest problem with Fallout Four is that I found the game boring. While the world is jolly pretty and Role Playing solid, ultimately the gameplay comes down to ‘Shoot the Dude.’ You shoot the dude, and then you shoot more dudes. There is no indication of why or to what end you are shooting dudes. Maybe it’s residual aversion to violence carried over from my years of being a Nintendo fanboy, maybe I’ve shot enough dudes to last a lifetime, or maybe the game is just dull. Did not finish  The framework is here for a great game if the narrative and shooting weren't so dull. I am holding out hope that in a few years Obsidian will come back and bail out Bethseda's dumb ♥♥♥ again. Like they did with New Vegas. DID I MENTION THAT NEW VEGAS IS A GOOD GAME",

Most of the DLCs are filler with content that could've been put in the free updates (which saw the addition of Survival mode, for example), and the base game is full of things that deserved more exploration such as what a DLC can provide. The Memory Den, the Fallout 3 protagonist's legacy, more details on the BoS turning into jerks again, more backstory on the Fallout 4 protagonists (come on Bethesda, you killed all character creation to shoehorn a husband and wife as your game's choosable protagonists, why the hell can we not explore their backstory further than throwaway dialogue options that say very little?). Everywhere you look, you will see something that could've made a good story or focus for a questline, and it's either not in the base game when it really should be, or it's been completely passed over for a DLC idea in favour of DLCs adding more rubbish to build in the mediocre settlement builder interface.

If you want a 1st person shooter with slight RPG aspects and not-so-slight Sims simulator, then this is the game for you. Story is 'decent' (Fallout 3 did a much better job with the family member lose thing), I feel weapon variety has greatly been toned down, and the dlc is all just more building stuff. The Mechanist DLC is not good i've played first-time modders quests and they have been more expansive and added more to the game and Far Harbor is basically a smaller Point Lookout with synths added to the mix.

It felt so dumbed down, just because it was more of a shooter than an RPG. There were very few quests compared to previous games, leaving you stuck with radiant quests after one quickly completed everything. Onto the extras...  For a game that seemed welcoming for modders, Bethesda really screwed up on it. Mods will disable achievements, including the unofficial patch. Not only that, but a lot of the mods available offer more in-depth gameplay and story than the DLC's themselves.  Almost all the DLC is pretty lackluster, so the Season Pass may not be worth it. My advice? If you want the DLC to add onto your game, just get Far Harbor and Automatron. Skip the others. The workshop DLC's will disappoint you.

Both did, however, possess decent RPG elements that meshed together with the post-apocalyptic setting to create a really unique experience. After completing almost every quest in Fallout 4, I can sufficiently say it barely met any of my expectations for a Fallout sequel released in late 2015. The graphics are incredibly outdated (running on a heavily modified Gamebryo engine that's beginning to show its age), the story is bland and uninspiring, the possibilities involving a fully voice acted protagonist aren't really explored, the morality system found in previous entries is entirely nonexistent, and, above all, the RPG elements were stripped away in favor of a more light-fare run and gun-esque shooter that pales in comparison to the complexity of other games with similar promises. To make matters worse, the Creation Kit that would aid with user-created mods hasn't been released at the time of this review, which places it firmly behind the same release schedule Bethesda had with Skyrim. I guess my feelings about the game can be summarized by the interaction my character had with (SPOILER ALERT) his dying father after enacting his plans to make free energy available to the wasteland - disappointed by the jarring abruptness of it all.",

        {
            "review_text": "I'll start with a few things I dont like: 1. 4-choices dialogue system. Its not as bad as I expected but in many cases it feels forced and limiting. Dont get me wrong, the actual dialogue writing is good, much better and more natural than Fallout 3 ever had. But the system has some problems. Sometimes its hard to predict what your character will say when you select a line (actually there is a mod that shows full lines before you select them but I played w/o it). And there isnt enough room for stats/perks checks other than speech/charisma. I think they did this primarily to limit the ammount of lines they had to record, since in this game the main character is fully voiced. Anyway, before release Bethesda said that Fallout 4 has more lines than Fallout 3 and Skyrim combined. And its not a lie. 2. Radiant quests. Those semi-random, repetitive and usually infinite tasks. Im OK with their existence but they should have only unlocked when there is nothing else left to do. Or at least moved to a separate quest category. But instead developers decided to mix real hand-crafted quests and random stuff together. If you arent aware of this you can be easily overwhelmed with those infinite tasks and come to a conclusion that most quests in this game suck, which is not the case. In fact most hand-made quests are very good. 3. Most towns are locked away or hidden in the beginning. Usually Fallout games have a lot of towns, and player always had a good starting point. In Fallout 3 you immediatelly had access to Megaton, a decent-sized town with interesting characters and quests. Fallout 4's 'Megaton' is your old pre-war hometown and its completely empty in the beginning, little more than a playground and settlement-building tutorial.  And now to what I like: 1. The world. Its big, its great, and its very immersive. There are a lot of places you can go to and all of them are hand-made. There you wont find a ton of similar caves TES games are notorious for. In Fallout each location is unique and has some kind of backstory. The environments themself are very immersive, some places you wont forget for a long time. And ofc its Fallout so the world is a little (well, sometimes not so little) crazy, in a good way. 2. RPG. I really like how Bethesda approached this aspect of the game even if a lot of people would disagree. Fallout 3 was full of pure evil choices, and while I think that having a lot of choices is good most of those choices had no sense at all. Maybe if you roleplay totally mad psycho they would. But often there was no actual motivation behind those actions. This is also true for some choices in older Fallout games, in fact they often had harsh penalties for doing something the 'wrong' way and possible rewards were rarely tempting enough. In Fallout 4 most choices are morally grey, rarely there is a clear good or evil side, it resembles a psychological test. What you pick usually depends on your beliefs and information you managed to gather in your adventures. Idiologies and beliefs play a major role in this game. And unlike games before it Fallout 4 never tries to preach moral (characters and factions themself sometimes do, but they usually contradict each other) and very rarely gives clear answers or solid evidence supporting a single view. It simply makes you do a choice based on your own understanding. This is also why I think there is no usual consequences slide show at the end of the main quest. You make your choices because you believe it will lead to something, having developers telling what it 'actually' leads to would destroy this. Companions play much bigger role now, all of them have their likes and dislikes, and occasionally participate in your conversations with other characters. They also often react to the world giving comments about locations or interacting with other characters on their own. 3. Combat and crafting. Aside from doing quests and interacting with different characters the main flow of the game is 'explore &gt; kill &gt; loot &gt; craft &gt; explore harder areas'. All steps are important and in my opinion all of them are very well made. The exploration part was covered before, this world is worth exploring on its own. Then the combat. Basically its a shooter, 1st or 3rd person depending on your preference, kinda old school shooter with no cover system or health regeneration, which is a good thing in my opinion. The gunplay is solid and doesnt feel clunky like it did in Fallout 3. Ofc there are a lot of different weapon types, and a nice stealth mechanic to provide more options. VATS (semi-turnbased auto targeting system) is way more usefull thanks to a lot higher actions point regeneration rate. Once you kill stuff you grab the loot and improve your equipment with it. The crafting system gives a lot of options, its not just for damage/defense improvements, you can install a lot of different mods changing items to complement your combat playstyle. Another good thing - settlements building and development is completely optional, you can totally ignore this part and find all stuff you need in the game world. 4. Difficulty and progression. At last, Bethesda's game thats not a total walk in the park. Even on normal first few hours can be challenging, harder difficulties, especially revamped survival, make it brutal. Yes, you get power armor early in this game, so you can feel godlike for a few minutes. But in fact its an old rusty model in very poor condition and only one half-charged power core, so dont expect it to be usable for long. Also most enemies in this game dont automatically level up with you, enemy levels are tied to their zones making leveling up and improving your gear very important and rewarding.  Overall, I highly recommend this game regardless if you played or not previous games.",

So my first impression from never playing any of the other Fallout games, and keeping an open mind at the same time was really really nice. I found the overwhelming amount of customizability well, overwhelming and by the time I was done with it I was happy with the smashing monster I created and went on with my journey. Now I don't have the most amazing computer which I probably should have mentioned earlier, and one of the problems I had was running the game, framerate and actually booting it, it's like spinning a wheel and seeing where you land, but instead of seeing where you land it was just, seeing it open, black screen and close then to be filled with endless amounts of sadness and dissapointment, only to realize I had math homework and went and did that instead, however I was able to get it to open a few times and kept it running all night reguardless of heat temprature on my PC (I am Canadian after all).  I couldn't have the graphics all pumped up like some people can, and so I ended up playing on a mix between the High and Medium advanced settings things. I did have some issues with framerate wondering around the commonwealth, however it stayed above 30 FPS most of the time, which I can stand and am actually comfortable with. However don't take away my 60 frames.   Even being that low, everything still looked amazing and I found myself well immersed in what Fallout 4 had offered me.  The story gets even more and more crazy and while I wish I could say my decision was just, I think the commonwealth needs to sort things out and with the Institute freaking everyone out, that might be the reason why everyone is turning on everyone.   The settlments and building was alright. I didn't build any crazy 8 story sky scrapers or anything, it didn't seem to interest me much, I just wanted to fly right back into the heat of action, and keeping my minigun barrel hotter than the next person. I do think there are people who are going to milk every last bit of the building system like a kid and chocolate milk. And man do those kids love their chocolate milk.   The combat system is pretty decent in my opinion, again from just getting into Fallout 4, I don't know whether or not it's an improvement but I'm going to assume it was and go on from there. I didn't try out melee fighting styles and I'm sure there's plenty to still be tinkered with, but having this booting issue really isn't helping my case here.  The weapon and power suit crafting was actually really nice. I made myself a nice handy dandy rootin tootin shootin laser pistol decked out to the sight with just about every attachment a vault dweller could dream of, and let me tell you does it ever do a number on those damn raiders. I just wish I could change things like color or shape of some things, and stuff like recievers had more of a cosmetic effect. But at the end of the day, if it has a barrel, a full clip and a ready trigger, you'll see it well worn with me.  Could never get the Pipboy app to work with my phone, makes sense since it's a iPhone 4S. And that came out in like, 2011. That was 4 years ago. There's like, 2 and soon to be 3 new models out after it.   I reccomend the game but to only one small hiccup.   Have a ready PC, it isn't any fun getting stuck somewhere in Boston seeing Molerats teleporting around you like a Synth on Jet.   If you prefer multiplayer games, it's a single player game so I take it it probably isn't that enticing.   And finally, if your a boring old nobody who has been under a rock and hasn't hear about video games well then. Crawl out through the fallout with me, and you'll see a whole new light in a wasteland that not even a million people could ever imagine living in.",

Fortunately, there is the vibrant story, all-encompassing , ridiculously extensive customization system which conveniently hangs on building settlements plus the Power Armor and slightly faster gameplay to keep everything fresh enough . So which 100 hours are as * plop * disappeared!  Based on my own PC specs the game isn't running that well. (that's why i'm giving it a negative review for now). It has no SLI Support (yet), and it's unplayable on UHD monitors. I'm currently playing on 3440x1440 and the huds and menu's are stretched out, it looks horrible. Further then that I'm just waiting for an update on these things before I continue playing and change my review.

They wanted the same game that they received with Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Fallout 4 is different. Yes, this means some stuff is cut which may be missed (moral systems, repairing weapons/apparel, etc). I think this is sort of a test for Bethesda - they want to know what works and what doesn't.  Most of it works.  Voice acting is brilliant, although it comes at a cost of the role-playing side (it's hard to play as a mysterious badass when as soon as you meet someone new you're like WHERE IS MY SON I AM A CARING PARENT I WANT MY SON). However, you CAN just ignore this stuff and still be a mysterious badass.  Look, despite the flaws of the game, the (some would say) weak storylines, (Bethesda should work with obsidian again for Fo5 methinks), and the lack of role-playing possibility, Fallout 4 is still an amazing game. It's worth the money. I still have faith and so I will continue to pre-order any future Fallout games and buy the season passes asap. It's worth it. It may not be perfect, especially if you're comparing it to the other Fallout games, but the game is still intrinsically amazing and innovative and b e a u t i f u l.",

Fallout 4 is not a Fallout game, it's an open-world shooter with RPG elements that are barely noticeable.  The main quest-line leaves very little room for role-playing. Do you want to be a raging sociopath that doesn't care about anyone but them self? Do you want to be a morally gray vigilante that tries to avoid emotional connections? A drug-addicted bandit that has no respect for authority and just wants to survive? Do you want to play as a character of your own creation?  Sorry, but if you want to actually complete the game, you're not allowed to be any of those. Bethesda has decided that you will be a grief-stricken spouse (either an aspiring lawyer or an army vet, depending on the gender you choose) that desperately wants to find their lost son, even though you only knew him for a little over five minutes.  In addition to the very constricting story, other aspects of the game have also had their RPG elements removed. Skills no longer exist, meaning that you can't create a character that is specially designed for certain paths. The level cap has been removed, allowing you to just keep going until you've basically become God.  The removal of the level cap presents another issue: balancing. Fallout 4 is not a balanced game. Once you've leveled up enough, you basically start cutting through enemies like butter. Legendary weapons are overpowered, allowing you to destroy just about anything in your path. And, once you've completed the main quest-line and leveled up enough, you will have nothing to do. The quests are extremely repetitive, with most of them being either fetch quests or 'go-there-and-kill-people' quests.  The voiced protagonist presents another role-playing issue. Where previous games would allow you to imagine your own voice coming from the PC, Fallout 4 forces you to hear someone else's voice coming out of your character.  All-in-all, the Fallout 4 that got released is a very dumbed-down and streamlined version of the Fallout 4 that we could've gotten. It's obvious that Bethesda developed this game with the hope of reaching mainstream audiences, which they've done successfully. However, in doing so they've potentially disappointed the dedicated fan-base that they already had, all because they wanted to reach a crowd that will forget about them by the time a new Call of Duty comes out.  Fallout 4 could've been a complex and fascinating RPG, but instead it was turned into a boring and repetitive open-world shooter. The GECK isn't even out yet, and still the fine folks at NexusMods have already released mods that make the game better than it initially was. The mods and the settlement building is the only thing that's managed to keep me playing the game. If not for those, I'd be playing New Vegas right now.",

New Factions like a Railroad and the Minutemen give you the view of winning but starting as an underdog. Fallout 4 wasn't another Brotherhood conquest like the others but instead the choice of who will save or destroy the commonwealth. Unlike the older games and stopping after you beat the other factions you instead can carry on being the champion of the wasteland.

            "review_text": "This is a little bit of a graphical review and comparison, and mostly a story review and comparison  The graphics are definitely not the best, but they're not 2011 levels of bad. The worst I get on ultra high is texture pop in, but I can deal with that as long as it hurries the hell up. It's beautiful, for a Bethesda game. Honestly I think it's a huge improvement over fallout three's one colour game, and the face models are way better than they were in Skyrim and fallout 3. Also I only find that certain characters have more of the fish eye look, Piper is possibly the best animated character in the game when it comes to facial animations, her eyes convey a lot to me, where as others are lacking, especially small side quest characters. Witcher 3 of course has better graphics yes, but after over 120 hours in W3 and pushing 100 in F4, I can honestly say F4 is still on a much larger scale, so I give it some slack with the comparison. Witcher 3 also pulls at a lot less strings emotionally for me, because there is an actual good ending, bad ending, neutral ending. Aside from Skyrim, Bethesda does what it does best at throwing a bitter-sweet, or down right heart wrenching ending into F4 (spoilers will be below the gap, so watch out for that). I mean I love both of these games, and Witcher 3 is by far, my personal GOTY, but I don't think it's fair to compare the two when the games are on different scales. W3 is huge, but its game is divided up into major areas, Fallout does have its own instances in buildings and such, but that's no where the scale of how Witcher 3 breaks up the game. also the ♥♥♥♥ that goes on in the F4 world goes leagues past Witcher 3, so I can understand why the game isn't necessarily as stellar, graphically. I do think they could have waited another year to get a new engine fleshed out (they did start working on this after Skyrim) to have better graphics, but you won't hear me complain about what we got. Also Fallout 3 and NV's dialogue trees will still lead you to the same response, if you want to believe me or not. Yes some might be varied, but a lot are the same. I'm not defending the dialogue system that's in place now, I hope they change it, but I do feel like it's not fair to point out a fault in one games dialogue system while not pointing out the same faults in its predecessors.      *SPOILERS*   Fallout 4 has no good ending in my opinion, whatsoever. Whereas in Witcher 3, there is a chance that Ciri will die, there's a 66% chance that she will live, versus Fallout 4 that no matter what you do, Shaun will die and you can either die with him loving and respecting you, or hating you for what you've done depending on if you side with the Institute or the other three factions. I played through the BoS ending, and the Institute ending, and I can honestly say that they both suck, not story telling wise, but emotionally. I felt bad after each ending, which is how it should be, given the angle that they were going for. I couldn't tell what was worse, knowing that I destroyed everything my son had worked his whole life for or returning to the Institute and being reminded that he's gone, just after finding him, either by NPC dialogue, or by hearing my player say 'goodbye Shaun' whenever I activated his tombstone. I feel like F4's main story was more driving than the glorified 'help your dad replace a water filter' in F3, or NV's power struggle. Don't get me wrong, I loved the NV storyline, but it's so unsatisfying. You should have been able to play after, seeing New Vegas with crucified people along the roads, seeing Caesar set up his throne in the Lucky 38, or seeing a Nevada, independent of NCR presence and Legion raids. All in all, I find that F4 has the most impacting storyline of any of the recent Fallout games, and it kicked the ♥♥♥♥ out of Skyrims 'fantasy action hero' story, where the toughest ♥♥♥♥ing decision you have is whether or not to kill Parthonaax. That's another thing, Skyrim had no choices whatsoever, except for like..three or four, literally, none of which had any major impact in the story of the game.  ",

I have played that kind of games since Wasteland 1, on my first PC, so I guess I can call myself a genre fan. Every franchise should develop and grow. For example New Vegas is the great game, but it's more a mode for Fallout 3 then completely different game. I can't say that new things that some people complain about is good or bad, they just different.   So to my opinion the new and cool stuff is:  - completely new approach to the power armor (more realistic one). You need a nuclear cores for it you need to fix and maintain its parts and so on. I heard that it's over powered to that this thing at the beginning, but the monsters and raiders also become more hardcore, almost each camp has a mini boss and legendary enemy with mutations. - whole settlement construction freedom. The thing tha was lack to my opinion. If you don't like it just don't build it, don't vine about you hate it so much. - optimization, shader quality, graphical part overall is great for that system requirements. The one who have New Vegas and Fallout 4 can compare ultra on New vegas against lowest on Fallout 4 and be amazed. (but you really better to compare with Skyrim). - veapon and armor cusomization and FINALLY some scrap utilization. This previously useless stuff become a treasure at some poit of the game. Found an old toster? Get it, later you will need a screws from for your new gun optics. - ton's on wastland content in cloth, food, drugs, weapons, armors....   Now the drawbacks:  - I also didn't like much the changes in the perk and level up system, but it's not so terrible, just unussuall. some perks make you to stick with a dog as a companion which is a bit stupid in the combat situations. - There are some bugs in quests and settelment managment, but they are not critical. - Need for food and water are removed even at the higest difficulty, so there are no proper hard core mode yet, maybe dlc will offer that.  - BoS acting very stupid sometimes, they can lost 4 air vessels on one raider camp with no score at all.  But overall the game ofers fresh look on the Fallout universe. Deffinitelly worth of buying it.",

            "review_text": "Fallout 4 fails to be an RPG, and instead suceeds to be a shooty crafty affair that feels more suited for young children. my most major complaint is the lack of NPCs, settlements, and towns. how can a game be an RPG when the first half of the game is looking at hideous brownish hills and the second half is joining one of four factions that turn the game into an barebones grindy MMO of the lowest caliber. I cannot rember a single side quest on my three playthroughs that felt important and wasn't go to a place and shoot things (I only finished my final playtrhough btw, had to force myself too because I wasted 60$ on this game). combat in this game is very bland, if someone wanted a game with medicore shooting and soul sucking MMO elments i would suggest firefall, this way they didn't have to engage in boring exploration and crafting. if some one wanted atmospheric exploration and crafting, I would sugest starbound. in Fallout 4 both demographics loose, but the biggest loosers are the RPG fans. The leveling system is the most barebones I have ever encountered. I will always be a fan of a cruel unforgiving game were your only freind is an impentrably dense leveling system that you must learn every detail and use properly to survive. ofcourse I can accept more leinent systems and I had more fun with the Skyrim leveling system than I am willing to confess. what the perk system does is it allows you to randomly select stuff without a shadow of intellgence. Infact theres no reason to have SPECIAL because it was designed for an RPG where you could avoid conflict. the final nail in the coffin for this game is the story. the story centers around synths, mechanical humans, who I can only conclude a third grader trapped in a cloud of red bull and ADHD medicine came up with them because they are the most blatant allogory for human xenophobia in any peice of media. this is by far the most annoying plot point in a triple A RPG to date. there are four factions who are competing for domination of the wasteland. all four factions are horribly bland and unfleshed out. the minutemen don't have any personality because they are unconditionally good and just an excuse for the city building system. The brotherhood doesn't care about any of the people of the wasteland and is over agressive. the institute doesn't care about the people of the wasteland and does some morally questionable science. the railway, I think they are called atleast, doesn't care about the people of the watseland but is uncoditionally good becuase they care about the synths. no matter which faction you side with they don't care about the wasteland only the synths. I don't care about the synths and most people shouldn't. this is excluding the minute becuase the player literally is their leader, they have no interaction with other factions, and roleplaying is physically impossible, hence rendering the minutemen a nonentity in the game 'world'. over all I feel like Fallout 4 was rushed out, the perk system feels like an excuse not to develop an indepth and balanced level system. the grind quests and city building feels like a way to not 'waste time' on indepth story lore or NPCs, and the story feels unispire and rushed. wellI guess 'ZENIMAX, ZENIMAX never changes'.",

The game has no RPG elements anymore, the godforsaken settlement system is pushed onto you regardless of what you want to do DESPITE being announced it would be optional, you are given a backstory completely removing and making the player feel dumb for even WANTING to make up their own story I've played many hours so far because I WANTED to like it, as an avid Fallout fan, I absolutely ADORE the series as a whole honestly. but this, this is just not acceptable. I wanted an RPG, I wanted Skills to level when I level up like previous games, I wanted to PLAY AN ANTAGONIST (and I know of Nuka world will allow you to be such, but that avoids the issue at hand that it should have been a feature to begin with, as sometimes I enjoy being as brutal as Atilla The Hun) This game is fun remotely for building and run-and-gun combat etc. nothing more nothing less. The Story in my opinion wasn't that great to be honest ANYWAY as I feel it restricted you to protagonism and all the factions seemed not to have Evil intentions. Hell. The INSTITUTE wasn't evil boogeymen people played them out to be. Not close to that of The Enclave, Caesars Legion or The Masters army from previous games. First times around was it fun? Sure, but replay value is non-existant. Bethesda recently has also decided to slap the modding community across the face with this Bethesda net BS, by stealing mods and allowing others to do the same from the Nexus which is unacceptable. and I understand this review is poorly done and sloshy, but this is just my opinion, you want to buy the game? go ahead your life your choice. Do I recommend this game? Hell No. Go play 1,2,3, Vegas or hell even TACTICS over this.",

While the game was an amazing experience the first time through and i loved it, my second run felt unbearably boring. The reasoning behind this is that every dialogue option or choice ends up being the same, it just depends on if you answer in a humorous or serious way. It felt the exact same as it did my first time and doesnt exactly feel free to do what you want. You have a set goal and there are 4 total ways of achieving that goal, those being the 4 groups you can side with. They all feel similar and just something to slug through to finish it, not as fun as the factions in new vegas.  Aside from the extreme lack of replayability that its predecessors have it also has a hard time giving you any memorable quests in the game. Of all of them about 3 are interesting where as almost every quest in the last installments were things you could never forget. For example, the first quest from fallout 3 in megaton was a quest anyone would remember but fallout 4 has just another 'shoot the bad people' mission time after time.  The building system could have been its saviour if it actually was responsive and useful in any way at all. Creating the structures is an extreme effort when pieces inside cant be placed due to colliding with absolutely nothing, the snap feature doesnt work at all after you have created the shell of a house. Settlements provide hardly any benefit and are rarely attacked, it isnt an epic battle fighting to protect what you have created, its just like any other wasteland encounter where you kill 2 guys and carry on with whatever you were doing.  The power armour is one of the most amazing features fallout 4 has to offer but yet again it has horrible problems. First of all, the power cores required to use them are extremely common so you can spend the entire game wearing it. Secondly, you basically cant die in it since it negates insane amounts of damage. The only option is to leave it entirely and then your experience will be more enjoyable.  The in-game world feels incredibly small and its easy to just find out you crossed the map while looking for anything of interest at all. The only rare loot is distributed in the form of 'legendary' enemies which are just slightly buffed versions of regular enemies. The loot itself is just slight buffs too, such as '25% less damage from mutants' or '10% more accurate' and not anything unique.  The amount of weapons is horrific too, you could argue that pipe pistols/snipers/repeaters/rifles are all different but when you can make any of them instanly it doesnt feel special. There are only a couple of base weapons in the game and they all feel the same.  All in all i couldn't recommend this game to anyone looking for the same experience as the other titles but if you are only planning on playing through once then it may suffice.  The survival mode update has been released and is the only true fun way to play after first completion.",

            "review_text": "This is a hard review to write, I have been a fan of this franchise since the first game came out back in the late 90s. But to sum it up, this is not an RPG. You are basically playing Call of Duty with zombies.  Pros:  + Graphics, if you use mods. + Crafting + Setllements, sort of. They add nothing to the main game or narrative.  Neutral:  = The intro. Way too short but passable. = World Building: Although the sense of being there is quite strong, there are too few settlements. They seem to believe the player should make them all. = Plot, Characters: The plot and characters are laughably bad, but since they were never Bethesda's strong point, you should come in with low expectations to begin with.  Cons:  - No Skills: This is a big one because it trickles down into the perk system and the dialouge system, as well as combat. For instance in New Vegas you can use your medicine skill to pass speech checks or to find alternative ways to solve a quest. Taking these out limits your options in the game considerably, in fact it limits them down to the point that 'Guns Blazing' is the only way to solve a quest. - The Perk System: Most perks just replace skills such as stealth, or simply increase weapon damage like non-automatic rifles. There are very few perks that are very decent, and they all have multiple levels forced on them. - S.P.E.C.I.A.L. : Very bad, whatever skills were not pooled into the perks were dumped here instead, for instance your accuracy in VATS no longer depends on your guns skill, it is now ruled by Perception.  Now for combat which gets its own section.  Pros:   + Stronger enemy AI. + Radroaches climb walls.  Neutral:  = Grenades. They use their own attack button and cannot be used in VATS. While having their own button can be useful, the lack of ability to use them in VATS can be difficult. Mainly because figuring out the trajectory and manually aiming is harder in firefights, especially in tight corners, and you cannot use VATS to increase your chances of not accidentally killing yourself.  Cons:  - Most enemies have too many hit points. I had to unload three full cilps from a minigun into a deathclaw to kill him. And and average ghoul takes almost a full clip with a 10 mm. - Power Armor: Power armor break lore, that simple. Fusion cores last centuries, not hours. Not to mention you get it way too early in the game. (Within the first 1/2 hour, unless you dawdle). - Ghouls: Basically they move too fast and have leap attacks. This is a personal thing, but in lore they are supposed to be very slow. And a lot more fragile (see too many hit points). - Mole Rats, Radscorpions and others: Basically except for dogs any creature you come across can dig into the ground burrow 100 feet in 3 seconds and pop up at your feet. I don't think I am the only one who can see how hard it is for any creature to dig through the earth even 1 inch in 3 seconds let alone 100 feet. Not to mention it makes sniping them at a distance even harder, maybe that was the point. - Legendary Enemies: You sometimes get a legendary enemy with very high hit points that will 'mutate' (heal) part way through the battle and drop legendary weapons. Of course the whole idea of farming legendary enemies to get legendary gear belongs in an MMO not a single player game. - Critical Hits: In RPGs critical hits are either because of luck or tactics (like sneak attacks). Here it is just a bar that gets filled in VATS end then you can execute it. As a result it behaves like power attack that you can only use every few minutes. This would fit in very well in Street FIghter or any other beat'em up game, but has no place in an RPG. -Hold Breath when using scope: When using a scope you 'Hold your breath' to temporarily increase your aim. I guess this might work in a shooter like of Call of Duty, but again it has no place in an RPG. - No Detection Radius: In Fallout 3 your perception indicated how far away you could detect your enemies on the compass. Now you cannot detect them at, even if they are 5 feet from you, unless they are currently attacking you. As a result you will be ambushed a lot, leading to a lot of tight, close ranged fired fights. Unfortunately it also forces you into that play style, because trying to get the drop on them by shooting at extreme range is almost impossible.   In short, this game is obviously first and foremost a first person shooter. Everything from the stripped down levelling system to the critical hits to the gimmicky things like 'holding your breath' and Legendary enemies screams that they are appealling to the Call of Duty crowd.  It is like a whole bunch of people bought Fallout 3 when they saw that the game can be played in first person and automatically thought it must be a shooter. When they realized they were playing an RPG instead they started screaming that the levelling system was too hard , you can't lean to one side, you don't hold your breath, they don't like missing the target because of some silly skill system, and what the heck are critical hits?  As a result Bethesda decided to say 'Oh, all you want is a shooter. Then we'll make you one and toss in a gimped levelling system that we hope will appease our RPG fans as well.' Well to be honest, it doesn't please this RPG fan at all. Fallout 3 and NV are both better games than this.  What they should have said is 'Look buddy, it's an RPG, skill systems are what these games are about. If you don't like it, why did you buy it?'  If you are looking for a solid RPG try The Witcher. Better yet try Divinity: Original Sin, Pillars of Eternity, or Torment: Tides of Numenera. Leave this one to the Call of Duty crowd, that is who they are aiming it at anyways, not you.",

Leaving aside the many bugs, poor opimization, and gutting of features from previous Fallout games, what really sinks Fallout 4 is the game's inability to create a coherent narrative from the massive amount of content Bethesda has poored into this game. It's as though Bethesda went out of its way to highlight to the player that their decisions and actions in the game are ultimately meaningless. The player is just along for the ride.  Take for example the game's companions. Take a companion who is part of one faction to a competing faction and no one blinks twice. Shouldn't it look a bit suspicious that I'm clearly partnered with and brought someone from one faction into the secret base of another? How about romancing multiple companions of both sexes who all live in the same settlement but seem not to notice this fact?  Fallout 4 has a ton of content and half-baked ideas that really could have used another six months to flesh out. The result has been a game loaded with things to do but where those things make little sense.  Finally, all games need to have an ending. Removing this was a terrible idea.",

There are only 4 fratction in the game and you can only join 2 of the for fractions, what the BIB.  2. Fallout 4 is all about the greens, the bucks, the cash and how can you see that, well Bethesda has released how many DLC's now, seven DLC's and this is not just a model used by Bethesda nope is used by other business like EA games. It all about sucking the money from your pockets instead of creating an contents rich game that will keep you entertained for decades.  3. Fallout 4 is not Minecraft it has the most horrible build your own house, city, whatever, building system, if you want a game where you can build whatever you mind can conceive, then play Minecraft it works. On the other side you are pretty tired after buildning settlement number one million just because the Preston tells you too, sometime you would wish that you could mircomanage all the work onto the settlers.  4. Fallout 4 is not firste person shooter. In an FPS you would never be in doubt, who the bad guys is, but is Fallout 4 you can easy ending up shoting an NPC when you are zooming onto a hostilie campe with your awesome sniper rifle. In a FPS you don't have to stop up and use VATS and then miss the target so badly that you end looking in the lower right corner too see if you just got an achievement named you miss that target fool.  5. Fallout 4 is not a rolleplaying game, it's in other words trying to be to many thing at ones, and it's out of date perk system doesn't help the game at all. You try to wait for gun nut perk rank 3 when you only are level 13 and all you want is too craft that awesome guns that you can kill any monsters with, but no you have wait for 12 level. Oh! BIB why hasn't, Bethesda exported the every awesome level up sytem from Skyrim it workes.   Conclusion Bethasda could have made the same amount of contentes that there are in Fallout 3 for Fallout 4. Export the leveling system from Skyrim to Fallout 4. Keep the crafting guns, melee weapon, armor, powerarmor, cooking, brewing sytem from Fallout 4 it workes but just added ammo. Make an more simple buildning you house system, and drop some of the one million settlements that you can build it's tiredsome. Then Fallout 4 would have been the game I want to play for the rest of my days.",

            "review_text": "I'm not going to go too far into detail here. I wanted to love this game. I really did. I've been in love with the Fallout universe since I was a kid. I have replayed FO: New Vegas more times than I can count and I'm in the middle of another replay of FO2 before I go back to FO3.   But.... this is a weird FPS/Minecrafty clone with a Fallout skin. Graphics are better, animations are improved, the weapon crafting system is nice, but it falls so short in every RPG aspect.   Choices are irrelevant, RPG elements have been casualized or plain wiped clean. Every character is the same. Or, rather, you have two choices: (1) say yes, agree, and take every quest you're offered or (2) sarcastically say yes, agree, and take every quest you're offered. Too many characters are classified as 'essential'. FO4 is INCREDIBLY limited. As a small example, the first half hour of New Vegas had more skill checks than this entire game.  The settlement system is poorly implemented, with weird glitches and control issues.   The game is poorly optimized, often using only 40% of both my i5 6600k, 16gb of 3200mhz ram and GTX 1080 in plenty of city areas and giving me only 40-45fps. CPU dependance is nothing new in Bethesda games (the draw calls are horrendous), but FO4 really takes it to a new level.   There's a lot of stuff to see, but a lot of it is wasted potential. There are so many areas that are so under utilized in the storytelling, e.g. a certain fighting pit and a certain galleria had countless opportunities, but were used for plain jane vanilla kill or fetch quests.  Again, plenty is improved. It's a very borderlands-esque, very looty shooter with limited RPG mechanics and a city builder. If you don't like Fallout, this is probably a fine game. If you enjoyed 1, 2, and tactics, or even just loved New Vegas, this is a huge step back. Heck, it's even a step back from FO3.   edit: I just saw my hours in the game.... that's not really accurate at all. Lol. I need to stop leaving my PC on overnight and while I'm at work.",

            "review_text": "Having sunk close to 400 hours at the time of this review (And undoubtedly more to come with another expansion on the way) I've largely enjoyed my journey in the game can summarize my time with Fallout 4 as 'Mostly Positive' but there definitely are some glaring flaws and issues with the game.   PRO's:  The Game World - Bethesda has yet again created a gorgeous, atmospheric Game World that is truly the best part of the game. You can set out in any direction and come across beautifully detailed and exciting locations/compounds and other interesting locations. Equally filled with action, and for those more detail oriented compelling stories of the remnants of Pre-War life via various terminals and documentation. The best adventures for me came from experiences not within my Quest Journal.  Gameplay - Didn't run really any melee so I can't really comment on that, but the gunplay felt incredibly smooth and enjoyable. With a wide range of customization for Guns/Armor/Power Armor you could really nail down what type of approach you wanted to take and make it work around your playstyle.  Companions - I really loved how they handled companions in this game and IMO ended up being the best characters of the game. Strong distinct personalities (And skillsets) that would change and open up to as they became more familiar and trusting of you. Companions stopping you during your journey to simply discuss things going on in their life was surprisingly always a treat for me, and made them and the world around them feel a little bit more real. Add that to the fact nearly all of them also have quests that involve their background/history that unlock as they grow more fond of you, and you can feel yourself grow more close. Match that with the fact that majority of them can also open up Romantic Love interest dynamics and a wide variety of different companions for every play style and you got a really well-done addition.   Far Harbor - Bethesda has a track record of outstanding, near full length games quality DLC and that was the same in this instance. They really knocked it out of the park, with beautifully crafted, atmospheric 'Bar Harbor' Maine, filled to brim with vast locations, unique distinct personalities/factions and tons of great choices and decisions to make. Honestly probably the best RPG decisions in the entirety of the game I experienced there. Fantastic job from there there.  Modding Community - As with any Bethesda game, the allowed and focused upon involvement of Mods makes this another HUGE positive. They are vast and extremely devoted and talented. An absolute highlight of any Bethesda game and truly benefit the game immensely. Seeing as this is a PC review, it's DEFINITLEY worth mentioning and the future is always evolving and promising with Mods. I wish more Devs would follow suite and do this.  Neutral:  Quests - I put this here because I'm honestly a bit torn. The 'Real' quests that actually were written I felt were actually pretty well done and immersive. Choosing between different factions, allies and decisions alot of times really had me sitting there, game paused, going back and forth in my mind weighing what I really wanted to do. Factions were really nice in the sense that they avoided the terrible Good Guy/Bad Guy cliche and really made all of them seem more gray and realistic. Everybody had their positives and everybody had their own skeletons in the closet that made them seem shady/unappealing. The debates you can find with fans debating who is best for the Commonwealth is a testament to that. So why have I put this under Neutral if I felt the quality was good? Because of the Quantity. Unfortunately it feels like you run out of the 'Real' quests somewhat quickly and find yourself in Radiant quest purgatory. Now I have no problem with Radiant quests, they add a little objective and incentive to go out and explore but they should NEVER act as the main substitute of questing and unfortunately it feels like they are way too frequent and common as compared to the non-repeatable quests.  Building/Construction/Settlements - I put this under Neutral for one reason. With my own personal bias, I absolutely LOVE this addition to the game. I'm the type of guy who spent countless hours in games like MC/Sims etc creating and building. I absolutely love this and one of my favorite aspects of Fallout 4 was creating my own unique and extremely detailed settlements and communities, writing the backstory and history of them. It was incredibly enjoyable from a creativity and immersion standpoint. The system is well done, and provides lots of different materials and objects for you to use. This only increases tenfold with the addition of Mods who REALLY open up building to a whole new level. Again, you may be wondering why I put this as neutral? Because quite simply it's highly subjective. There is a large crowd who don't want this addition and feels it has no place in this type of game, and if you are one of those people you will find this quite unappealing because Construction and Settlements play and gigantic role in this game. 3 of the 6 DLC focus and are dedicated to this feature, and it is a big part of the feel and play of the game. So it's really a matter of whether or not you enjoy this type of gameplay or not. If you do, your in for a treat. If not you'll grow to despise it.  Negative:  Repetitive Nature of End-Game: Again, this kinda harps on the Quests topic but I feel like it's worth mentioning again, and not in a positive light. The main quest and various 'Real' sidequests will provide a good amount of fun, exciting content and the Landmass DLC's provide even more, but when they are all wrapped up and completed, you will be at the mercy of THE SANDBOX. Which for many is enjoyable given the incredibly detailed and well-done world, but will eventually grow tiring. Your endgame will consist of maintaining and growing settlements and exploring the various locations of the world, solely for the purpose of explorative enjoyement and supplies/materials/resources. Radiant quests help in this regard but given how early on you encounter them you may find yourself avoiding anything Radiant like the plague.  Dialogue System - Now I will say I disagree with alot of the comments that you cant be evil because that is definitely untrue. You can be a Grade A ♥♥♥♥ and downright evil if you want to (Selling Children to slavery, keeping cures to yourself and leaving kids to die, betrayal, robbing, murdering, lying and all the goodness of being a baddie galore and much more). The only difference you don't get a pop-up that reminds you that you were naughty. HOWEVER the dialogue/voiced antagonist was an absolute disaster. Nothing against the Voice actor himself/herself, they had lovely voices but it severely limited options and 4 selection dialogue wheel was very limiting and quite frankly a failed effort. Bethesda has even acknowledged they know they made a mistake, and it went poorly, and good on them for it. So hopefully it will be a case of 'Tried it, and learned our lesson' and won't see it in the future, however in the case of this game it is DEFINITLEY worth mentioning. Especially when you consider the quality of Dialogue found in games such as Witcher 3.   In summary I had an absolute blast with the game and it has kept me invigorated and playing for a long time, and the future still looks bright with one more major DLC on the way and the Modding Community. There are a few glaring issues and omissions from the game, and quite frankly YOUR enjoyement could very well come down to your subjective preferences and likings when it comes to Structured Rails/Open gameplay. It's story shines at points, but it's certainly not Witcher 3 levels of a great main questline. To any who enjoy a beautifully crafted, invigorating and incredibly detailed open world, with creative outlets you will like.   Final rating: 7/10",

I don't care what the negative reviews say... if you've spent over 100 hours in a game, you've got your money's worth. But it's the devs lying about the minimum specs that makes it bad.

Also.. no multiplayer, a big letdown for my type of game. So yea, I was a hater from the start and was not going to get it.  But hey... I had nothing to play and I felt like wasting some money and it was Fallout 4 or Black Ops 3 .... took a glance at the reviews for Black Ops and about 40% of the reviews out of 8k reviews where negative I chose Fallout.   And I'm glad I did... this is also my first Fallout, haven't played any other Fallout... so I can't help you in making a choice if you're a big fan of the series and hope for improvements cus I have no Idea of the past games. But it's very fun and addictive. I don't think it's a must get and must have, but if you want something to do and not be board out of your mind waiting for that 'game' you have been waiting for to finally release, Fallout 4 is an amazing game to pass the time.  I also took a look at some of the negative reviews on this and some are understandable but most of them are lousy. I look at twitch now and it's been top 3 since and even before release.

I held off buying for a long time based on so many bad reviews from true Fallout fans, but the latest Steam sale made it too tempting to resist. I bought Doorkickers for $2.99, which I'm enjoying a lot more...but I digress.   Fallout 3 was revolutionary. It hooked me for hours, days, weeks, eagerly exploring the next unknown area fighting to the death and scrounging necessary loot to upgrade and survive . Fallout 4 looks better, but falls far short in every other way. There is now a large green rectangle (marker towards next 'goal') that destroys immerision and any real exploration.

            "review_text": "I feel like, it's a good game specifically if you aren't a Fallout 'Fanatic', but honestly if you are, I'd say it's a not a very good 'Fallout' game. This was one of my most anticipated games ever... And I would be lying if I said it didn't disappoint me.    1) The new dialogue system is so bland and barebones. It used to be a lot more open ended and have truly unique options. Now we are limited to 'Yes, No, Maybe, Sarcastic (Yes)'. Ultimately it has killed any motivation to even listen to dialogue anymore.    2) While I don't mind the main character being voiced, he's a terrible voice actor. Sometimes I wish he would just shut up lol. His dialogue lines are so bad sometimes, I just kinda chuckle and think 'wow'.   3) The settlement system initially seemed like a really cool idea, but it's littered with bugs, poor placement usability and honestly serves little to no purpose. The settlement people suck at defending themselves and honestly taking care of them doesn't help you or hurt you in any way at all. So it's essentially a useless game mechanic that just drains the resources you could be using for upgrades. I think all it does is make you psychologically think your doing something, making you feel like you're making a difference in the wasteland, but really it's nothing but an extra chore.   4) Fallout 4 essentially has turned into an open world shooter, nothing more, nothing less. The developers focused so much on smoothing out the gunplay, the game is lacking any true RPG mechanics. Lots of the new perks are basic and/or useless, and the skill system has been ruined with you being forced into having to put points into skills that you will never need just to get to the 'one' good perk. It's just flat out simplified and dumbed down.   5) A simple mechanic, you would think, is letting your settlements share resources because, ya know, that would make sense rather than individually transport them yourself to each settlement right? WRONG, they made it a 'Perk' to have caravan convoy locked in the most useless skill tree in the game, creating nothing but a huge hassle of having to individually have to take parts to each settlement to fix and install things. Stupid, just stupid.   6) Even though I do like the addition of the new 'Individual' pieces of armor. It can feel like a huge pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes. Also there is so few clothing sets in the game that actually lets you wear them and the sets together. Lots of clothing sets aren't compatible with the pieces. So your basically stuck wearing the same few sets that are compatible. Why Bethesda? Just... Why??   7) A very important mechanic that would fix the problem I just mentioned but, it's absolutely MANDATORY, to join and play through the quests for the 'Railroad' faction. They are the only ones that can enable you with the ability to upgrade clothing. That is a very important mechanic, especially considering you can't wear 8̶0̶%̶ A LOT of the armor in the game with the individual pieces, but your forcing me to cooperate with the lamest faction in the game to gain such a important ability? Again..... why Bethesda? Just Why??   8) In Fallout 3 and New Vegas, there were countless quests that were just so memorable and unique. Those are the kinds of things that make the Fallout games so interesting, quests like Fallout 3's Dreamland capsule quest to New Vegas's Space Rocketship quest. In Fallout 4, I didn't play a single quest that was 'memorable' all the quests really lack style and uniqueness. All the quests just felt like your basic run of the mill 'fetch' quests.  9) The game is filled with so many bugs, from people appearing on top of buildings, to quests not being able to complete, to flat out missing NPCs. There were seriously like 5 quests I had to use the console commands to complete because I was stuck in the middle of a quest and it would not let me progress.  Sadly I can go on and on about why this game ♥♥♥♥ed up. I can't recommend this game, especially to die hards, and I can't recommend it people new to the series either because I would rather recommend they start with Fallout 3 or NV. I'll be honest though, most of the things mentioned dont necessarily make it a 'BAD' game, but in my opinion they do make it a bad 'Fallout' game. It's seriously the Skyrim of Fallouts, decent game but not respectful to the origins of the series. Casualized, simplified and gutted of all the things that made Fallout, 'Fallout'.",

There are tons of sidequests but like in anny bethesda game allot of these sidequests are reskins of one another. I love Crpgs, Arpg, Jrpgs, rpgs in general. And like Fallout 3 and Nv. This is a 60% shooter with 40% rpg elements. The real RPG is gone with the wind since fallout 1-2 are gone. So do not expect that.  So is this game good? Its bloody amazing. im having tons of fun with it. People are getting spoiled these days and begin to attack and copy almost everything they see on the forums. In the olders days this wasnt the case since social media alike did not exist. People arent open to change annymore and some so claimed 'nostalgia factor' that people so cald have us this as an advantage to blaim the company who made the product. I love fallout en Tes. And i have seen them evolve, with ups and downs. But they stay amazing and great. So if you want a good time and can see past some minor bugs (search your pc build) i would def. buy this game. And enjoy. War, war never changes. Sry for the bad english.",

            "review_text": "My personal GOTY  Though I'd have to say, stay away from the majority of dislike region for a few weeks if your on the fence about buying it. Not saying 'some' of those people have valid points just that most people on that side of the review are either ♥♥♥♥♥ing about the voiced character or why they can't play it on their 300 dollar laptop.  I've been playing this almost non-stop for about 7 and a half days now. Here are a few Pros and Cons to take into consideration.  -PRO-As far as I'm concerned, they took the old gameplay aspects and jammed about 20 vials of Psycho into it because I have never actually played a Fallout game the same as this one, as in using my head instead of using my hammer. In FO3 - FONV I mainly just played the tank and dove straight into combat and killed pretty much anything. In FO4 if you try that they'll be scrapping your balls off the ceiling within a mater of seconds. A perfect example of this I found was the Deathclaw. In FO3 in the later levels they were a nuisance, but they were far from anything I'd call a threat. The first time I saw a Deathclaw in FO4 I got my ♥♥♥ handed to me on a silver platter... and I still try to avoid them best I can out of sheer terror for the damn lizards.  -CON-Yes the graphics aren't amazing but you should take into consideration that graphics aren't everything when making a game. For those complaining about the graphics I'd have to tell them to just go to the store and get a ♥♥♥♥ing painting. That should be enough to satisfy you for a few years yeah?  -PRO-The voice actor I found makes the dialogue options much more interesting as now you don't just have a few lines of text to go off of, you also can hear the emotion in the words to convey much more feeling... especially whenever you click the 'Sarcasm' option. Those who don't like the voiced player, guess what? There's a mod. Problem solved yeah?  -CON-It's a little bit buggy, one that I found to occur often was the infinite loading screen while fast traveling to certain places, as well as the classic 'Hard Crash' where your walking somewhere and the game has a heart attack. No doubt the modding community will work tirelesly to fix these minor stutters. No game's perfect after all.  -PRO-Some people feel like the RPG levels are toned down... maybe so. But I don't feel like it's ancestors were that much RPG deep either. In FO3 you were a kid looking for your father. In FONV you were a delivery boy... a ♥♥♥♥ing delivery boy. And people complained that being just 'A father looking for your [SPOILERS]' is a bad thing. Why? I'm genuinly confused. From what I've seen the RPG is as strong as ever, and then some.  -CON-This is just a personal quirk. I didn't like how they handled the companion system... it's really nothing other than I want to be able to once again take 2 companions. One human/main companion. One pet/side companion. Nothing much but I suppose the modding community can help me out here.  All in all I'd say this game advances the series in a way I can definitely agree with.",

            "review_text": "Fallout is my favourite game, as a long time fan of the series and a fan of Bethesda's titles, I feel like it's my duty as a player to give my honest opinion on Fallout 4. That being said, I'll try to be as unbiased as possible because it'll be real easy for me to dive right into this and just say 'The game's amazing.'   First off, the story. Bethesda's releases in general recieve a lot of flack for lackluster and uninspired storywriting. I can safely say this has been true for the most part in a lot of Bethesda's titles. This is not to say the story is 'bad' per se, but rather the way it's been presented hasn't been the most, clear, or thorough. Whilst a lot of people also have this view on Fallout 4, I can say this is not the case. Fallout 4's storytelling whilst not perfect, is a vast improvement on Bethesda's previous titles. It feels concrete, thought out and the individual characters which are part of the story feel real, with realistic emotions, decisions and outlooks. Whilst on the contrary in Fallout 3 for example, some character's felt like they were simply there as scenery and held no real association with the story. In Fallout 4 it feels like every character has something interesting to say with their own stories to tell.  Gameplay: I'm going to use Fallout 3/NV as a reference point here because there's a lot to be said on how Fallout 4 differs from them. The gameplay, in my opinion is Fallout 4's finest feature is has to offer. If we go back in time 7 years to release of Fallout 3 and compare the two in terms of gunplay for example, we'll have two completely opposing scenes, so vastly different that it's staggering to imagine the games were made by the same company. Fallout 3, whilst I hold the game dear to my heart, had some of the worst gunplay imaginable. It was clunky, mouse sensitivity was an issue, there were no iron sights and VATS was almost needed just to do anything. Now fast forward to Fallout 4 and we have a robust, very up-to-date and all around fun combat system. There are dozens of options to choose from, combat wise, a very detailed and intricate weapon modding system and to top it off, the aiming is smooth and VATS is no longer a necessity, but rather, an option. Fallout 3 also didn't have the vast majority of features that Fallout 4 does today. One obvious big difference is the addition of base building, something Fallout 3 never had. The base building is not perfect and there are recommendations everyone could make to improve it but regardless, it is still very fun, intuitive and an absolute blast to build your first settlement and look upon it thinking 'I did that.'   Without rambling too much, or ruining some of the game's features for those that haven't played it yet, or are wondering whether they should get it I'll move on to one last controversial topic before I round this off.   Speech/Dialogue options. In previous Fallout and Elder scrolls games speech was vastly different to how it is now. For those who don't know or haven't played other titles, your protagonist wasn't voiced, but there were a lot more detailed speech options and usually delineated what you wanted to say accurately. However in Fallout 4 many have argued that the new speech system doesn't hold up the same standard it did before in other games. The speech options are vague at times and often don't portray what you want to fully say; This take's away from the RPG element of the game as a whole and whilst this is not game breaking or ruining in any sense, it is my only minor complaint about the game that could be tweaked.   To top this review off, I'm going to say what I've wanted to say throughout this entire wall of text. Fallout 4 is fantastic. Simple as that. If you're a big as fan as me, then you'll agree with me when I say this game was worth the wait and then some. Fallout 4, to me, feels like   home   and gives me this inexplicable sensation whenever I play it. The same feeling I had playing Fallout 3 all those years ago, wandering through the wastes and being absolutely dazzled by the vastness of everything and the immersion it gave me. I have no doubt in my mind that given the success of Fallout 4, Bethesda will continue to make Fallout games for years to come. But there will never be another game like this. There will never be another Fallout game that lives up to the hype, and wonder that Fallout 4 has lived up to.",

            "review_text": "Fallout 4 is a game where it could have better gameplay elements from Fallout 3 and New Vegas, but instead Bethesda chose to make Fallout 4 mainstream where everyone can have the same experience and easier to play despite being a open-world that you can freely choose to explore on your own.  Much like any other Bethesda open-world games, they still have the same gameplay features. You still get quests that revolve around you despite being the only person to change something for better or worse. There are 'dungeons' to be explored, which is mostly in-door facilities, which end up giving you loot containers and some several notable items. There are towns which you can visit to barter and getting random quests that you'll recieved regardless if you want it or not.  One of the newest addition in Fallout 4 is the ability to make your own settlements to call home(s). You can build structures, bring in settlers to generate food, materials or act as a vendor. Bethesda say it's a optional thing to do but it's essential to the game as it allows you to easily make currency and restock supplies easily without going to towns. You can also craft your own weapons and armor that'll give you some gameplay advantages.  Much improvements were made that was lacking or needed in Fallout 3/New Vegas. The notable one is the guns function smoothly and sastifying to use. However, the artifical difficulty makes Fallout 4 really bad at excelling combat due to bullet sponging enemies, cheap shots that can one shot you without proper gear and grenades thrown at you are hard to determine if they're about to explode in a few second or less.  The 'dumbing down' on Fallout 4 is the RPG system where it's simplified to be in a perk system, removal of the karma system, which really was to check if you were good or evil, and the dialogue choices you picked that leads the same conclusion. This is especially true when deciding what to do in the ending. The storyline is somewhat the same as Fallout 3 but in a reverse role, You play as a character that you have a son you've lost and you must find your son in a completely different world. Whether these decisions was made for the medium is for better or worse.  If you're a fan of any bethesda open world games that offer exactly the same architecture of questline, exploration and don't mind the changes on the RPG elements, then this game may be fun to play (Discount the amount of time you can spend on building your settlements). I don't recommend this game to anyone who had played games with better gameplay mechanics. ",

That being said, there are many, many ways that it could be improved. My most major gripe is the rampant and major lag spikes that happen in some areas of the map. It's pretty unacceptable to me that this still happens in 2015. I'm hoping that graphics driver updates and patches will fix it, but the game is nearly unplayable at some points. The second major gripe is that the settlement system is rather clunky. There is no way to see who is assigned to what resource, so it is overly difficult to assign people properly. Finally, the last major flaw of the game is that there's only one overarching questline. I would've like for the game to be more like New Vegas, in that you can really play however you want: Be a good guy who does what you think is right for the Mojave, or be bent on revenge, or whatever. The elimination of skill checks, branching storylines, and the addition of a simplified, voiced dialogue system ruin this.   If you don't care too much about my complaints, then the rest of the game is great. The quests are fun, if a little repetitive at times. The crafting and new perk system are some major improvements over past games. I have played almost 50 hours since it came out 2 weeks ago, so obviously I love it. There's a massive amount of content here, for $60 I'd say that you can spend your money on this and it won't be wasted.",

You can easily lose an afternoon in the customization of your armor, weapons and base(s) (mostly in looking for the materials needed to build them). The gunplay is incredibly solid, and nothing feels overpowered or broken. The soundtrack is also very well done, complementing the game beautifully with a haunting, ambient piano when exploring as well as a great collection of old-timey songs that set the tone for Fallout's retro-dystopian setting.

            "review_text": "Short Review: +Dramatically improved gunplay and combat mechanics +Overhauled power armor system resolves balance issues present in older games +Significant improvement to animations and models +Crafting and settlements are a welcome addition +Large and diverse variety of companions +Boston is colorful, vibrant and fun to explore  -Voice acting kneecaps roleplay -Speech checks are now chance based and not skill/stat based -Perks and stats are oversimplified  -Weapon variety is abysmal -No faction standing or meaningful faction interactions -NPC pathing might as well not exist -The usual assortment of frustrating bugs -Significant performance issues from the death-throes of Gamebryo  Long Review: Fallout 4 is a mixed bag.  In some aspects it's a straight upgrade over previous titles, and in others it confusingly ignores the advances those games made. Fallout 3 was notable for it's vast, expansive world begging to be explored, and New Vegas was notable for it's stellar roleplaying and choices that affected the story in very tangible ways.  Fallout 4 doesn't really have either of those things, infact it acts as if New Vegas never existed and completely ignores many of it's advances and improvements over 3.  Most jarringly the faction system here is hollow, there is no standing, no diplomacy, no way to play both sides or do any political maneuvering.  Factions don't care that you just did a mission for their enemy, or have brought a companion into their base from a faction they're sworn to kill on sight. There's no way to make two factions cooperate even if they have the same goals, your alliegance is decided the moment you accept their final mission.  I encountered immersion-destroying situations that would never have occured in previous titles like when I brought Danse, a member of the zealous Brotherhood of Steel, to meet with a Synth from their sworn enemy, the Institute. Not only did Danse have nothing to say about me working with the enemy under his nose, but when a random encounter occured, and Brotherhood soldiers swarmed out of a Vertibird to fight the Synth, Danse happily watched him massacer them without complaint, occassionally parroting pro-BoS dialogue while the Synth killed his brothers.  The game is full of oversights like this that just snap you right out of it and remind you that you're playing a janky, awkward game.   Speech checks are now based on chance, rather than your stats, and can simply be savescummed, you cannot fail a speech check because there's always a chance you'll pass it regardless of charisma, just keep reloading until it works. There are no intelligence, science, medical or survival speech checks anymore, nothing based on stats, they're gone.  The leveling system has been, frankly, gutted. There are no stats at all now, just SPECIAL and perks. Points can be dumped into SPECIAL at will without needing to use any clever combinations of perks to raise them, and rather than being specialized improvements perks are now blanket upgrades and are uninteresting. Most of the time I don't even care that I've leveled up, there are no perks that I want.  In previous games I might have dumped points into the energy weapons stat, then combined it with some special perks that add unique effects to energy weapons, like making killed enemies explode in a chain reaction. In this game, there are perks such as '+20% damage to rifles', or '+50% VATS recharge speed', it is boring. New Vegas had 117 perks, Fallout 4 has 70 perks, each with several ranks that just improve it's effect.  The writing is poor, characters fail to react in believable ways, or have knowledge they couldn't possibly have. Upon talking to a detective character I had just met, he suggested I use my dog to track down a fugitive, then referred to the dog by name. At no point had he met the dog or been made aware that I had a dog. Most of the dialogue options are an illusion of choice, and characters react the same way regardless of if what you said was negative or positive. Another such notable encounter was when I met a mercenary captain, who claimed I had killed some of his mercs at a nearby asylum, but had no hard feelings and wanted to hire me. 'Oh, I remember that place!' said my character. I had infact never been to this asylum, and not started the quest to investigate it yet.   While weapon customization is fun (however shallow), there is a huge lack of variety here, New Vegas had over 200 weapons, Fallout 4 has around 50. I say it's shallow because in general there is one 'best' configuration for each weapon, with most mods being straight upgrades with no drawbacks. The only real choice in most weapons is what scope you want to use, and what fire mode.   Fallout 4's biggest strength is the new gunplay system, which is far more fluid and responsive than it has ever been. VATS had to be used as a crutch in previous games because guns were hard to use manually. In this game manual shooting is fun and reactive, it's possible to ignore VATS entirely if you choose to.  Power armor is better than ever, one of my largest complaints about the older games was that once you got power armor, it invalidated anything else you could wear. In 4 your armor is more of a vehicle than clothing, it requires fuel, and you can wear your regular clothes under it. It makes deploying your armor a cost/benefit analysis rather than just wearing it forever because it has bigger numbers.   Building settlements is reminiscent of Minecraft or Halo's Forge, and while incredibly addictive and satisfying, it lacks many of the quality of life features common to such games, like the ability to disable snapping or use grids. This system adds a use for all of the junk you can collect around the wasteland, but at the same time introduces some daunting grind. After dumping hours into this system (it was infact my favorite feature at first), I have come to realize that it's ultimately superficial, no amount of impenetrable walls ringed by laser turrets will prevent a settlement from generating random quests to kill ghouls and raiders that would realistically be shredded before they got within 100 feet of the concrete walls.   While the graphics in the game are certainly some of the best we've seen from Bethesda, I genuinely feel like they fall short of what is expected in 2015. This is partly due to the aged and decrepit engine Bethesda insists on using which at this stage brings to mind imagery of a senile old woman chatting to the decayed corpse of her pet budgie.  It is time to move forward, Gamebryo had outstayed it's welcome in 2011, it's almost an insult to see it still in use in 2015.   The last thing I'd like to talk about, is the performance. Godrays are being excessively tessellated, up to 32x, disabling godrays through the options menu DOES NOT WORK, the value must be set to 0 in Fallout's .ini file or limited to 16x or 8x through the driver with absolutely no noticeable visual impact. This will result in FPS improvements in excess of 15fps in AMD and older Nvidia cards. The same is true of the volumetric fog, which has an insanely large performance impact at almost no visual benefit. Once I had tracked down and disabled these features I saw my performance literally double.  Recent driver updates have of course helped with performance and stability, but the game remains far harder to run than it's visuals would indicate.  There are also various technical issues, game engine speed is tied to framerate so if you unlock that get ready for SANIC, there are issues with non-US keyboards like certain wonky bindings that can't be changed, and mouse acceleration that is enabled by default, among other things.  In summary, despite the various problems this game has, it's undeniably addictive and it would be disingenuous to leave a negative review based on the time I've spent playing it.",

Steam's system asks if I ultimately recommend this game, and the answer is unhesitantly yes; the game is fun, huge, filled with content, and allows myriad playstyles.  Although I wouldn't say so myself, I understand why some people think it's not a very faithful sequel; the character is largely predefined as a loving parent, the voice acting makes the character seem more grounded in the world at the cost of being one step farther from the player (though I prefer it this way), some of the RPG elements have been changed around, and the FPS elements are more emphasized (though again, this is something I prefer).  Also, as for graphics, this is the best-looking Bethesda game ever (which is nice, because they all looked pretty similar after Oblivion). And while it certainly isn't stunning (why does everyone compare every game to Witcher 3?), there are already ENBs on the Nexus to satisfy whatever purist itch you might have.   The upshot:  Despite perhaps being a mediocre Fallout game, Fallout 4 is a fantastic game in general; you'd be doing yourself a disservice by missing out due to all the negative reviews.",

            "review_text": "COMPLIMENTS:  The world is so large in this game, and so full of opportunities to explore and find unique places and ways to die in Survival Difficulty. This game is not short on chances to seek out difficult challenges, which in my opinion is the single most amazing improvement over previous titles. And having such a large world may mean having more empty space, but it also means having more hidden treasures to really dig in deep hunting for.  People complain about the graphics, but they're an improvement over previous Fallout titles with better creature meshes, better animation, and a generally more satisfying feeling after watching something blow up. As the mods already pour in copiously, the PC graphical experience will only improve more. And if you really study the 3D modeling and animation, you'll notice just how terrifying some of the game's monsters are up close in Fallout 4's default graphics. Deathclaws never looked so savage. Feral ghouls never looked so aggressive. Radstags, a new addition, look majestic and tasty.  I'm one of the few local people I know who has a computer that could support 75 FPS and the visual acuity to appreciate it, and I'm not even upset about a 60 FPS lock. The game is smooth and enjoyable at that frame rate. Thank gods it wasn't locked at 45 or even 30 FPS, which *some* game studios thought was a good standard in the still-too-painfully-recent past.  Some linear dialogue and actions can seem disguised as branched and meaningful, but try dragging around some companions, being sarcastic for a few giggles, or jacking up your Charisma a bit by wearing some fancy clothes occasionally. In the end, the way that you carry yourself has some truly incredible outcomes if you're willing to follow up and really look for them. This game doesn't hold your hand and force you to be omniscient like other titles do. I rather like that Bethesda didn't change that replayable aspect, and that the voice acting has improved overall.  Finally, the settlement building system, despite its stumbles and infancy, is truly remarkable if you invest considerable time and effort into it. And what's even better than that? You can focus entirely on making just one settlement successful for the achievement and if you end up hating it, you can totally opt out of it for good after that. I'm still on the fence myself, but I'm looking forward to exploring this avenue and deciding for myself. From what I have seen on Youtube, there is the potential to build settlements that are literally intimidating castles, sexy bachelor pads, or even killing pits for unsuspecting settlers that are your prey.  COMPLAINTS:  Engine: Bethesda didn't create a new engine for Fallout 4. You get all the old bugs which are a bit smoothed over, and a few more on top. Bad NPC pathing, getting stuck on a quest that failed to trigger the next step, flying deathclaws, unexplained random crashes, etc.  Difficulty: Some locations only respawn low level raiders who are basically trash mobs in crummy armor. Only a nuisance when backtracking or repeating quests.  Dialogue: I rather miss the unique dialogue I used to get from playing a character with only 1 Intelligence in previous titles. Fallout just isn't the same without that. Then you sometimes get 'Death by Dialogue' still, which is pretty annoying.  Story:   Not quite sure why The Brotherhood of Steel is slowly becoming so evil. There isn't a viable excuse for this. I hope that Bethesda can better explain why this faction dedicated to bettering humanity is becoming a bunch of heavily armed jerks who are starting to hinder humanity's true progress toward enlightenment.    Research: I'll admit that I'm a bit tired of Fallout being so monochromatically dirty and depressing. Chernobyl was a nuclear event with a fallout worse than a nuclear detonation and plants are growing there 30 years later. So many sickly looking weeds and dead trees where some lovely plant life should be. Thank goodness for mods.  Engineering: Buildings made directly out of junk to look like junk would make sense in the post-apocalypse. Breaking down junk into raw materials to craft brand new things that look like junk doesn't really make sense. Engineering didn't die as a concept when the bombs fell. People can still make nice stuff, but the game's junktown theme seemed to be valued over common sense in this regard.  GAME RATING: 8.5/10 MOD COMMUNITY RATING: 11.1/10",

After finding out the how much cut content there is and realizing the water down RPG expirence, I understand the disdain people hold for this game. Honestly I think Obsidian Entertainment should just handle the Fallout series from this point on, people consider New Vagas the best Fallout game in recent memory anyways.   They wouldn't make reckless decisions, and plus they help created the orignal Fallout games in the past, I would say their studio is way more suitable to handle the franchise and would be a welcoming change.",

One however has annoyed the ♥♥♥♥ out of me on the 'confidence man' mission... essentially what's happening is two npc's wont die and they are supposed to be killed as it is part of the mission. What I mean by that is if you kill them they will just fall over and get back up. I won't go into too much detail about the mission and what npc's I'm talking about for those who are looking to buy the game and don't want spoilers. But it's a glitch that bothers the hell out of me and if you don't start the mission at all you should be good. Other than quite a few annoying bugs and glitches I'm really impressed by this game and is a must have for anyone who is a fan of fallout games or even elder scrolls games",
