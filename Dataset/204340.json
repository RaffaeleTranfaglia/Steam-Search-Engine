            "review_text": "I was dared to play this game to completion, and I regret it immensely. While I successfully completed the game, I feel as though a part of me is now missing.  This game is soul crushingly boring and tedious, and while that is part of the Serious Sam style of game play, it entirely misses the point of what made the first two games fun.  This game makes you feel small, slow, and generally not very powerful. The enemies soak up huge amounts of damage even on lower difficulty levels and while the previous game had specific weapons to use against specific enemies, this one has several enemies that seem to have no weaknesses, and they enjoy throwing them at you in huge quantities(Footballers)  While there are sometimes big open areas and arenas in this game, you are often specifically confined to much smaller arenas than the previous game, and the designers just toss enemies one by one at you for 5-10 minutes. The developers even seem to realize that this is annoying because there are several voice callouts that Sam makes that emphasis that they are just tossing fodder at you in a padded fashion.  The game is split up into 7 distinct sections, the worst of them being the TV challenge series section and the ice world levels, where they introduce a resource mechanic where Sam will freeze to death, yes, Serious Sam will freeze to death, the man who can walk in lava. There are long auto scroller sections often with downtime or enemies on all sides, while confining you to extremely small areas and giving you very little in the way of dodging room. At one point there is a sewer level and the developers thought they were clever by saying all games had sewer levels and making it a maze, but it only calls out how much everyone hates these levels and it drags on far too long to be humorous.  While the developers added many new enemies to this game, they all behave as re-skins of existing enemies and don't add to the variety in play styles. Many of the enemies that people lamented from the previous games are back and more annoying than ever, almost as though they thought it would be a good idea to harass players of the existing games for having the audacity to question their design decisions. The flying enemies move around waaaay too much and too fast, and while you can usually lead them around, they tend to cluster directly above you where you can't easily aim, or stay way off in the distance where very few of the weapons they give you are effective.  They added turrets and vehicles to the game this time around, and it was a huge mistake. While the turrets are typically optional to use, the quantity and rate at which they throw enemies at you implies that they expect you to use them. Anchoring the player down is in stark contrast to the run around at the speed of light I loved in the previous game. The vehicles are typically overpowered and you just hold down mouse one and abuse the infinite ammo until it forces you to get back out of the vehicle. On rare occasions you get out to pull out the minigun and shoot down the flying enemies that you can't hit with the vehicle weapons.  The audio comes off as polished, but wears thin quickly. With as much as you hear the weapons sounds and musical tracks that don't fit with what you're doing, you grow tired of them, and I eventually turned off the music and turned down the sound effects to listen to something that wasn't going to put me into a coma.  The game while generally technically competent and feels polished, has a glaring technical flaw. For a game where almost every enemy runs straight at the player, the pathfinding in this game is horrendously broken if there are any obstacles. The enemies often spread out and run in the opposite direction of you, don't notice you at all, or get stuck behind objects that really should have been accounted for in the levels. This leads to parts of the game where you hunt around for several minutes trying to find the last few enemies that have become stuck in the level before the game lets you continue on. (You must kill all enemies to continue through the level.)  The pacing of the game is rather poor, and it takes away your weapons at the start of each of the 7 distinct sections and makes you run around collecting them, creating a saw wave difficulty curve, and ends up simply annoying more than interesting. They knew they didn't have enough content to make the game the 8.5 hours that it enforces on you, and it shows everywhere, leading to long drawn out sections that are neither harder, nor easier than the previous, just more of the same. If you finished the first three sections of the game, you've seen the rest. It's just another set piece behind the same tedious actions.  The boss design is typical Serious Sam, where you don't shoot the boss yourself, but play some gimmick that hurts the boss. Most bosses are invincible to player weapons(not technically but you could shoot them for an hours, run out of ammo and still not kill them), and they don't feel particularly rewarding to defeat. The first boss is possibly the most insulting boss I've ever seen in a game. If you take no action, the boss dies within 1-2 minutes, with no involvement. It's a 'protect the AI while the AI kills the boss' battle, and I'm astonished they even put it in the game.  I'm giving the last level a special section because of how much I hated it. The last level is a one hour slog through 1200+ enemies while the game showers you in armor and health, and then throws an extremely tedious boss fight at you that will make you question your life, unless you exploit the terrible pathfinding on the AI fighters and hold down the fire button on the vehicle until the boss dies. In comparison with the typical level, it has nothing to offer that is new, just more of the same that you'd grown tired several sections back, and is more than 6 times as long as the typical level.  I cannot reccomend this game in any fashion. If you liked Serious Sam, pick up one of the others in the series, and avoid this one like the plague.",

Do I really like straight forward, no fooling around, linear maps and repetitive tasks?   If you answered yes to those, then this game is for you.  I remember that my cousin used to own this game, I saw the cover, but I never got to play it, until now. Now...  + The humour of this game might be corny at times, but at least I feel like it's well executed, it did make me laugh more than one time.  +The controls are fluid enough, you can jump and aim with ease, handling the guns itself is simple and self explanatory.  ? The music gets kinda repetitive after a while, mostly because the combat music seems to be the same between each stage of each chapter, it drills your brain and stays there like dental caries.  + The visuals, for an old game like this, are pretty good. The skybox are those dreaded 'Far away, yet leaning towards you' buildings and mountains. Everything looks rather smooth, to be honest, no slowdown, no matter how many enemies there are on my screen.  -/+ Difficulty wise, it might be unforgiving for noobs at times, like me. But eh, I don't really think about this as a flaw if you love a great challenge.   - This is a fatal flaw in my opinion, that kinda makes the experience a bit lacking for me. I dunno about the other Serious Sam games, because this is the first one I get to play. But this game, is monotonous as all hell. Basically, you move to a room, fight 40 enemies in an open area, move into the next one, fight 60 in an open area, move into yet another room, fight 50 more again. Over, and over, and over, and over. Occasionally, you get to mow down enemies with a machine gun or something like that, but guess what? Open area, enemy wave. Over. And over. And over. Make it stop. I wouldn't mind fighting 20 or so enemies per room, but sometimes, it gets ridiculous, what's worse, there are some areas full of helicopters, demons with missile launchers, headless kamikazes or orc football players, you get your ♥♥♥ blasted from every single direction. I actually had to move and reach the checkpoint, because the enemies wouldn't stop coming. As soon as I was dead, I respawned, there were no enemies to be found. Give me a break.   All in all, it's one of those games that, even if I do not like them that much, I'd still recommend it to people who are into mindless action packed shooters. It's a good game, just doesn't hit the nail on the head for me. And it's waaaaaay too repetitive. Give it a try, and judge for yourself.",

Serious Sam wasn't ever serious, but this one is absolutely stuffed to the gills with zany. There's a lot of awkward, miss-the-mark humour in it. The old bestiary have been remade as silly cartoons, although bizzarely some of the new additions are unimaginative humanoids, and some of them commit the sin of having hitscan weapons, making them priority targets despite being lowly minions.  You still mow things down with a minigun, then do it some more, then finally maybe it'll let your index finger uncurl for some dancing-with-kleer and a double shotgun. Except both at the same time. While popping off some rockets at a giant spider in the distance, and sniping a helicopter sweeping across the fray. The offhand grenades are an excellent addition for adding a little extra firepower and rewarding you for herding enemies into clumps.  You still can't rocket-jump without taking your legs off below the knee, but you can still run at 30MPH on your last hitpoint, desperately dancing and weaving through laser blasts toward a health pickup. Cover is something you blow up to deny it to the enemy. It's still Serious Sam, and it's not got the vast expanses of the first, but it's still big. And twice as long as you might think at first. A lot of stuff happens, and it's not lacking in variety of scenery and experience. Even the turret and vehicle sections are welcome shake-ups to what otherwise might be twenty hours of the minigun spinning.  And it's nice to have Sam moving *towards* MENTAL for once, not sideways, or backwards into prequels. For all its screwed-up tone, and some lousy and unfun early-level design (what were they THINKING with the single shotgun?), by the finale it's one adrenaline build-up after another.",

            "review_text": "Even though I have owned most of the Serious Sam games, I would not call myself a hardcore fan. I spend most of my time playing Serious Sam 'casually' . Overall Serious Sam 2 keeps the classic flavor of the series, but adds a bit of story for spice, and updated graphics (at the time). If you are not familier with the Serious Sam games, you could see similarities with them and the Duke Nukem games, or maybe even Shadow Warrior. The main difference between the two is that Serious Sam is still enjoyable no matter how long you play it and Duke Nukem, just doesn't have that, atleast not for me. Serious Sam is a classic fps, that can be pretty hard on higher difficulties, especially considering what passes for a 'hard' fps now days.    I first experienced Serious Sam 2 on the original Xbox at the time, and I really did like it, but I think the game feels more 'natural' with a keyboard and mouse. I jumped at the chance to play some Serious Sam 2 with family sharing, and figured since I played it for a bit on pc, and played it alot on Xbox I should write this review for you all. If the info above was not enough to get you intrested you should know that multiplayer can be pretty crazy. I dont know how often games are going on the Steam version of the game, I havent looked very hard. But from past experiance I can tell you that Serious Sam multiplayer can get frantic and fun, whether you are in a co-op game or a classic death match! If you dont know about the series, go take a look, and if you are a fan, you already know what SS2 has to offer. Also be sure to look forward to Serious Sam 4, lets hope it sees the light of day.",

Fight some boss, get medallion repeat until you get all 6 pieces. It's very repetitive and feels mindless and pointless. With jokes and humour that falls flat and only those 10 and under would be amused by.   This is like the kids version of Serious Sam with cartoony over bright graphics and enemies such as clowns and witches that look like they came straight from a cartoon and clowns have the exact same cackle as the witches and instead of the major mechanoids there are now T-Mechs which have dinosaur heads and tails and Rhino Cybertoys which look like giant wind up toy rhinos instead of Sirian werebulls which just shows new enemies are made with a kiddie like theme. And while I don't mind, kiddie or cartoony type games, I feel it does not suit this game and prefer the darker, grittier feel of The Serious Sam Encounters.

Serious Sam 2 is a really good game with a pretty interesting storyline, in my opinion of course. It does not require too much out of your computer with system requirements but, then again if you have a pretty good gaming computer like myself, the requirements should not be much of an issue, but regardless the system requirements are not too bad so most people should be able to run the game pretty smoothly. The controls are a bit confusing at first but you get a hang of it throughout gameplay. I like the game because it has a few kicks with the humor it had to offer, whether it being when Sam spoke or the humorous gameplay itself. I rate this game 10/10 and I would totally recommend it for others to buy and play.",

SS 2 focused on being action packed and fun with nice detailed world and variety. It has nice cartoony graphics and not cellshaded crap.(Cellshade probably only works well when game is black and white)   +visuals,audio and arcade gameplay is in harmony, and finally feels 'serious sam' to me.This is the style they need to work on. (special mention to Croteam's very talented music composer) The original models and art style never hooked me and felt out of place, too random. SS2 is perfect direction. +constant action and the nice,cute world keeps u playing with big smile on ur face.One the most fun FPS ever.I instantly felt in love with this game from minute 1, other SS games takes time and special mood to like. +u no longer getting stucked in dead bodies +weapons feels better to use now, u no longer have to deal with poor paper guns +doesnt feel repetitive and boring like other SS games  +-moving speed is slower than SS 1. Which was already 'slow' a bit, but for this game the speed feels just right.It doesnt hurt gameplay.It still a fast paced game, with the lot of actions happening. +-lot of cutscenes (all skippable), but some of them is worth to watch  -pisspoor pistols, cant even destroy crates/barrels lol (why are pistols in the game at all) -the bad gameplay design to not allowing backtrack for hp and ammo is still here (i never know when and how to manage my resources) -the switched idle-battle music is still annoying -japan and lava planets (even the jokes) are weak and those planets shouldnt even exist.Game is too long for a single sit.They just recycled content heavily and pointlessly.Also the world doesnt even look that uniq or well designed as other planets. -spamming rockets is not fun, and forcing this is mistake.All SS games in a nutshell. -i dont liked the physics/collison on terrain of this game,its not arcady.(Everything else is pure arcade in the game except this) -invis wall simulator -less tactical/mechanical than originals -turret and vehicle combat sections",

The secrets are still plenty, though.  Still, there are definitely some good things that should be mentioned : - the locales are varied and some are quite interesting; - the soundtrack is rather pleasing as well; - good enemy variety; - the game manages to recapture the very essence of Serious Sam - the 'Dancing with the enemies' type of gameplay, where enemy, weapon prioritisation and good movement as well as decision making are vital.  All in all, SS2 tries to have variety by bringing some new interesting gameplay mechanics, such as vehicles/turrets or some gimmicky levels, but unfortunately most of these are executed poorly and alongside the general problems of the game overshadow the good stuff.",

Serious Sam 2 sets the stage for the final confrontation with the main villain, Mental, but the story and ending are very, very disappointing. One of Serious Sam's namesakes, endless waves of enemies, feel monotonous rather than epic. Enemies seem more like reskins of each other rather than new and interesting creations.

            "review_text": "There are generally mixed feelings about Sam 2, but your enjoyment of this game depends on what you enjoyed from the others in the series. It's bright and colourful, just like the first 2 parts. It's humour is also taken from the first games, although it's a bit goofier. The game experiments with a lot of different ideas, which is generally good, but it does this earlier on, which may make fans of the other games less comfortable. Most of the weapons from TFE and TSE are back, with the exception of the Flamethrower and grenade Launcher. Instead you can throw grenades with right click,which is very iseful for taking out tougher enemies without switching weapons. Apart from that it's more or less the same as the first games, but it isn't in HD. If you liked the colour and silliness in the first games, you'll like this. If you're looking for a more serious game, try Sam 3 BFE instead. Chronologically Sam2 is the latest in the series, so you won't spoil anything by jumping straight to 3. For diehard Serious Sam fans it's definately worth a try,",

I enjoyed the hell out of this game, and you will to if you give it a chance! For such a 'crappy' game I got over 20 hours of enjoyment for the $3.40ish I spent on it during the Serious Sam midweek sale. This game is another HIGHLY underrated gem that gets hate it does not deserve.",

My answer to this would be yes if you are looking for a game to have a good time and some good fun.   Pros: 1. Most importantly the game is fun, the gameplay is nice, and sometime the jokes and situations are funny. 2. The graphic is ok it does the job 3. It took me some hours to finish the game I am happy with titslength.  Cons: 1. I do not know what was the issue but I had to skip nearly all the cinematics as they made the game crash. Even the last one. So I had to watch it on youtube!!! 2. The game gets a bit repetitive (Hope I wrote it right) 3. To be sincere its not as funny as I thought it would be. Some of the jokes and situations just fell flat. 4. I was never a ble to make a multiplayer game. There is simply no one to play against. 5. Last cons spoiler sorry. You never see the main bad guy of the game, NEVER.  I wish Steam would give us the ability of not just vote Good game or bad one. This game is a good one but not perfect. Its worth buying if its on sales. ",
