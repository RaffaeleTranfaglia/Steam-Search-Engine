First of all it felt like an endless runner game to me, because you just fly up a seemingly endless tube just to face one endboss again and again. The enemy variety isn't that great either! Maybe this will change up in later levels, but it couldn't keep me entertained!  Keep in mind that it will only cost you a dollar! There are games around that'll cost you more and are far worse than Madrobot X!  Loved the chiptunes!  Go for it if you're in the mood for a little old school Shmup Snack!",
