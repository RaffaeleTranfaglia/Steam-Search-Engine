    "description": "Enter the ambient world of Osmos: elegant, physics-based gameplay, dreamlike visuals, and a minimalist, electronic soundtrack. Your objective is to grow by absorbing other motes. Propel yourself by ejecting matter behind you. But be wise: ejecting matter also shrinks you. Relax - good things come to those who wait.",

            "review_text": "The principle of this game is fairly easy: you start off as a small sphere shaped object (I call it the “cell”) and seek to be the largest object on the rectangular shaped map. The rules are simple: if you touch a cell smaller than you in dimensions, you consume the counterpart and grow larger. If you make contact with a larger object, you will be consumed. You can move only by discharging mass from within your cell in the opposite direction you wish to move along. The repulsive force will accelerate your movement. Of course this will make you shrink and be exposed to new threats. So you better not waste too much mass. You are given only one tool and that is the control over the pace of time.  While the rules are readily comprehensible, the gameplay might be a challenge. There are modes where you are concerned with finding the most economic “route” of consumption from a logistical point of view. In another game mode you will find AI controlled opponents who try to grow large as well and eat you before you can eat them. Lastly, you will find a game mode where the organisms are organized like stellar systems – these maps ultimately require basic knowledge of orbital mechanics in order to be mastered.   No matter what game mode you choose, basic knowledge about mass, force, acceleration, velocity, momentum and gravity will come in handy. I wouldn’t say that this is strictly a physicist’s game though. I am sure the game is also fun for people who play it by intuition only, I would recommend it to any puzzle solving gamer. There are an infinite number of maps - each time you beat a map a harder one will be generated, what a perfect challenge! ",

            "review_text": "This game is a downgrade of a game I played in elementary school. In that game you were a fish in the ocean and you had to eat smaller fish to get bigger so you could finally eat the bigger fish that were actively trying to eat you. It was a lot of fun, the game had a huge scenic map and a wide variety of fishes to see/consume.  In this game you're an orb in a tiny circle shaped map absorbing smaller orbs so you can absorb orbs that were bigger than you. The other orbs simply bounce around aimlessly, completely doing away with that uncouth motivational aspect of kill or be killed. If you think about it, Osmos is a lot more sinister than the previously mentioned game. In Osmos there is no need to get stronger to live, you simply get strong so you can be the strongest.  Yet Osmos is a widely talked about game that some have called a 'meditative experience'.  This is why I have blind hatred of indie games.",

It starts out so easy, so relaxing, it has the ambience sound effects and sound track, one just enjoys clicking through the first few levels.  Then it gets a little more challenging and I thought, oh well there is actually some gameplay involved here. And finally the simple principle was taken to almost unfair difficulties. At first I just wanted to quickly get all the achievements, because I thought it would be easy. It took me a lot of time to really achieve all of them in the end.  The bottom line is: This is probably one of the most relaxing games you can play besides Higher (a flash game with rather similar music), but it actually has some potent game mechanic in it that will pose a challenge if you want to take it that far.  The visuals are very suitable and quite nice indeed, the soundtrack is absolutely fitting and plays a huge part in the atmosphere that the game creates. The basic principle is easy to learn and difficult to master, just how it should be. This game can teach you patience.  On a side note: Awesome game for smartphones and I imagine perfect for tablets (I also played through it on my smarthone).",

Osmos is better than both as it blends and meshes these ideas and adds in curve-balls like gravitational vectors, black holes, mass-loss, the ability to speed up or slow down time and a sometimes haunting sometimes thrilling soundtrack.  10/10 Would play again.",

At first, this game is very relaxing, and very interesting, however some of the levels were insanely difficult later on, (especially if you try to get all of the achievements.) There are some great physics mechanics in this game (and in some of the epicycle levels, you'll learn about orbital physics...if you do the research yourself) but it's also lacking proper tutorials for the more difficult epicycle levels, and although the tool for slowing down and speeding up time is immensely useful, this game would have benefited so much from a time rewind tool, similar to something in Braid. You could be attempting a level in Osmos for a very long time, and mess up just in the slightest, and have to start all over again.   I think the game should have also involved a greater variety in the graphics. Different colours, effects etc. And I think it would have been a lot more engaging for the player to include more levels of similar difficulty, rather than just ramping up the difficulty with each respective level. (But on that note, you can randomly generate your current level to anything you want which is very useful.)  All the negatives aside, this is a really relaxing game during the early stages with some fantastic ambient music. The physics for the most part is really well done, and the variety in the main levels is excellent. In the end I would classify this as an above average, 5.8/10 game. There is enough in Osmos to make me hate it as much as there is to make me enjoy it. It was a Humble Bundle game, and regardless of MSRP/Steam Sale price, it's pretty cheap, so I guess it's worth it.",

I'm not 100% sure if it's in space or in a microscopic environment) in order to eat the smaller ones so you can grow. Let's say I enjoyed this game for about 10 stages, then I kept going just because of the achievements. But it got harder and harder and even harder, until the point I was stuck for 3 hours on the same stage and it was wise to just rage quit. In the end, despite its qualities, it wasn't fun to play. Whoever tagged this as 'Relaxing' definitely haven't played enough.    Pros  :    I think it's safe to say its physics aspects are spot-on: gravity, orbits, momentum, action and reaction etc.    Graphics are beautiful in a simplistic, clean way    There's a great variety of levels--some rely more on skills and agility, others are more focused on puzzle and strategy    Being able to play procedurally generated versions of a level you're having trouble with is a great feature that might help you move on     Cons  :    The speed flow was the most annoying thing to me. Some levels get waaaaay too slow, even on the fastest speed. It's even more irritating when you're retrying a level for the 213048th time.    Controls aren't as intuitive as one would hope--it gets better with practice, but it remains relatively weird    The BGM used could be nice in a different context, but when you're on a stage for 10 minutes, for the 213048th time, those interesting noises are just obnoxious (even though it's quality music).     Moves way too fast from easy to insanely hard    Made me actually dizzy and I caught myself biting my nails after many, many, many years--I'm serious! Osmos is anything but relaxing!     Bought on / for  : Humble Mozilla Bundle by Humble Bundle for an average of US$ 0.20 (R$ 0.50).
