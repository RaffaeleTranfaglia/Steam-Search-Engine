            "review_text": "Hype and expectation are funny things. They can invite even the most rational and level-headed into wish fulfulment FAR beyond the truth, and we all know how prevalent that is in video gaming. I honestly believe that this game's reputation absolutely suffers from precisely this, especially from the view of some players.   So, Shadowrun Returns - the question is 'does it', or rather 'does it REALLY warrant the return?'   Let's start with the expectation part I mentioned. When this game was proposed, those that were fans of the old tabletop RPG and the old SNES classic sat up and took notice, and for good reason. Nostalgia aside, both are truly excellent games in their own rights. The downside to this is that it tends to set the bar VERY high, expectation-wise.  Fast forward to the game's release, and there were certainly mixed views; much of the criticism dealt with there being less on the action and more on the text and story. Also, length was cited too, or rather, lack of it. On the face of it, very valid criticisms, except that many of these either forgot or didn't understand WHAT the game was achieving - a new version of the classic games, adhering closely to the rules - in short, Shadowrun RETURNS. The clue's in the name. It does what it says on the tin.  So, there's an abundance of text and story, and less of the action itself, and yes, it is a bit short. While they are valid concerns EVERY game buyer should consider before dropping their cash, context is also equally important. Apologies for this slightly overblown introduction, but I felt it valid to lay this down at the outset. Let's get on with the review.  If you know what Shadowrun is (or was), then there's little point in going over this and you can skim to the last paragraph. If you don't, then as I've already said, there's the classic tabletop 'D&amp;D style' game - a pure, unadulterated old-school pencil and paper RPG. The hook here is that elves, orcs, goblins and all the staples of fantasy exist, but the one major difference is everything is a futuristic sci-fi bent. It probably sounds completely at odds with one another, but it works so very, very well, both in lore and in combat ... ESPECIALLY in combat. You can still hack 'n' slash if you want to, you can still use magic if you want to, but add to the mix firearms and a complete veneer of futuristic and modern tech, and you have Shadowrun.  It rather goes without saying that anyone who has spent any time playing old-school tabletop RPG knows that story and text are perhaps the premier parts, and that is the case here, naturally. But the question to the critics remains 'ah, but it is any good?' Thankfully, the answer is 'yes, it is'.  I confess I'm a little jaded. I've been around gaming since the very start, and have never had a period when I've not been involved. I've seen a lot, played a lot, own a lot, and have even worked in the industry (albeit relatively briefly). For the most part, I care little for story in games - most times I'm merely concerned with the mechanics over everything else. I couldn't tell you the story of Halo, for example, as it never gripped me in any way. So, why on earth am I saying this game's story is good? Because it DID grip me right from the off. It works. You know the story's working on you when you can start to identify and remember the characters. So, being heavy on the story is an ASSET to this game, and in no way a hindrance. I shan't spoil it in any way, but it's a fairly standard story, but it does it pretty well, so in summary I don't see the critique of 'too much story, too little action' in any way a bad thing unless it's REALLY not your thing.  Now, onto length. Yes, it IS relatively short. However, you should at least consider the reasoning behind the game's existence - it would never have seen the light of day AT ALL were it not for crowd-funding. Sure, you can claim they made big promises and ran out of resources and/or time, but the conclusion here is that putting all those aside the end product is pretty damned good. As stated before, it very much does what it says on the tin. So, if you don't mind quantity being less if the quality's good or reasonable, then there is no issue here. What does render the length argument completely invalid is one thing - WORKSHOP support. There's TONS of user-generated content out there which not only mimics what tabletop RPGs are all about, but the inclusion of mod tools (which I haven't tried) ensure that it's pretty easy to dole out a good scenario, and it certainly shows. So, if you finish the game and want more, you won't be disappointed at all.  The combat is best described as being very similar to XCOM. It's turn-based with the dual-turn set of movement/action phases per character, or a mixture of those: you move, you shoot/swing/etc, and your turn's over. Your playfield is peppered with objects that you can utilize as cover, with the shield icon offering how good that cover is. This all offers a lovely tactical play where you don't just consider dumping your character up against the enemy and swing away at them, but you have to consider balancing cover with line of sight, flanking, and a number of other little tricks to make the best use of the battle.  Character skills are great. As you'd rightly expect from a combination fantasy/sci-fi, it lends you a VERY wide palette of things to mess around with. Fire-based magic attacks? Sure. Rifles, pistols, or SMGs? Yup, have at them. Fire-based attacks WITH your pistol? Yup, that too. It does the Shadowrun rules well, and the interface is clear and intuitive and you'll have no issues picking it up quickly.  Visually, the game offers a very nice art-style that does the medium justice. Backgrounds are all pre-rendered and hand-drawn (or at least they LOOK hand-drawn) in a graphic novel style which suits perfectly. Nothing I can fault here at all. Musically, the soundstrack is really good. I'm not a big fan of music soundtracks - I'm not one who will listen to them outside of the game. To me, they're a background that serves to provide ingredient to the recipe. They should illustrate without hindering the game in any way. Not only does the style and mood of the music suit perfectly, but it's not repetitive, and remains interesting without hindering in ANY way. If you're someone who does listen to game music absent of the game, you might well find this one very appealing.  So, final summary time. Is it worth purchasing? Yes. If you are expecting a good turn-based old-shool RPG, it's worth it. Steam Workshop really underlines this, value-wise. The only caveat I would make is that if you're either not sure whether this sort of game's for you, or the length of the official game really is an issue for you, I'd thoroughly recommend waiting for a sale - it's still worth picking up.  Final note I'm doing with all my reviews now: I'm giving a 'what do I think the game's worth?' instead of any score or other metric, as I think that's the most valuable metric anyone could have. I'd say this deserves a £9 (or your regional equivalent).",

            "review_text": "I hesitated in picking up this game after reading a lot about how terrible the original campaign was and how the game was dull and boring. It also didn't help that I didn't really know anything about the Shadowrun universe. During the Summer Sale though, I was in the mood for something new, and picked it up. I just finished playing through the original campaign (Dead Man's Switch - DMS) and have to say, I'm glad I bought the game.  Getting the basics out of the way, I admit that DMS is very linear. There is a lot of reading involved. And besides combat, there's not a lot of interaction with the world. Still, as someone who knew next to nothing about Shadowrun before I started, I think DMS does a very good job of introducing the player to the world and the mythos surrounding it. The reading will probably be boring to someone who is deeply familiar with the setting, but I found it very useful. Gameplay is likewise straightforward which allows a new player to dive in without fear of messing up. I played a Street Samurai / Decker and had no trouble. I did find myself wishing I could build a party and level them up, outfitting them and whatnot ala Baldur's Gate, but perhaps that will happen in an expansion.  All in all, this game was well worth the $4 I paid. I also picked up the DLC, which I read is much better - I look forward to trying that next.    ",

            "review_text": "My last reccomendation was unfair to the development team. I overlooked the fact that this game was pumped out by a minimal staff in a very short deadline, so I'm going to re-write my assessment.  Boring, clunky, and linear.   This game has great concepts behind it, but is not executed well. The storyline might be a fascinating read, but does not engage the player at all. The best scripted fight, the last fight of the game about 8 hours in, is almost as fun as the prologue of Neverwinter Nights. Almost.  My biggest complaint is with the story, but the game has potential to give the community what they are thirsty for. I'm not overly impressed with the graphics, and I really wished I could have changed angles from the point of view on the field, but for the most part the combat and character navigation is easy enough to manage. The equipment is very simple, though not explained well (*cough cybernetics cough*), and you don't have to put much thought into micro-managing your character or your hire-by-mission squadmates. It's impossible to get attached to characters as they're just a portrait to represent the mathhammer you wield as the gamer.  I did really like the etiquitte aspect to your character. The game gives you more conversation options if you have a higher Charisma stat, and with a higher Charisma you learn new jargon by which to speak with the appropriate factions (ie shadowrunners, security, corporate, or gang). Unfortunately, the dialogue is still linear and it only provides introductory ports for the equifinality of the storyline.  Pros: cheap, potential for community contribution, non-demanding of hardware, neat concepts. Cons: easy, impersonal, clunky, and inconsequential.  4/10",

            "review_text": "If you were to cross Bladerunner with The Dresden Files into a quality tactical strategy RPG hybrid, the result would no doubt be something very akin to Shadowrun Returns. Shadowrun Returns excels at story telling, the game is rich with lore, well written dialogues that feel more conversational than what most games accomplish, and a structured story full of plot twists and interesting characters. Perhaps my favorite point about the story is that it starts out small-scale, you are on a simple mission to look into the death of a friend, but it slowly ramps up into something larger as the story progresses. To top it off the game is set in a beautiful futuristic game world and has solid tactical gameplay to boot.  More than anything this game to me was about an awesome sci-fi detective story. The mystery and intrigue suck you in, the stellar writing especially in regards to dialogue keeps you hooked. I'm not saying the game mimics what street talk may actually be like in the future, but it was great enough to get me immersed in the street life of futuristic Seattle. The characters within the game range from annoying (intentionally so), charming, grumpy, and likeable; chatting with the regulars throughout the story and going through the different chat options was something I enjoyed doing (shout out to Mr. Kluwe, you're the man, man!). The game's audio and visuals do justice to this story, bringing it to life with stunning hand drawn environments and appropriately mood setting music.  The game's combat also leaves little to be desired. Although I felt the large scale management of the game to be a little inconsistent...for example the money you earn throughout the story can go into temporary lulls, and if you need to do a mission when you aren't expecting it you may find you don't have enough money to buy a full team of mercs. The game runs similar to most other tactical RPG games, especially similar to the XCOM series. You use the terrain to your advantage and in a turn based fashion you move your team about and order them to attack or use utility items/spells. On hard the game isn't terribly difficult and you shouldn't have to think deeply each turn on how to best arrange your team and how to best utilize there action points (how many actions they can take per turn). The combat is a bit sparse at the beginning of the game but as you progress further you start to battle the baddies more often and that's when the fun starts.  Shadowrun Returns is a solid tactical RPG game, and with the addition of the Steam workshop can keep you playing well beyond the twelve hour campaign. The game's story is strong and the characters within are fun ones. It's nice to play a detective style game that isn't a point and click for a change. The game is quite gripping and just like any good detective novel it kept me at the edge of my seat until I got through to the end.",

This is one of the most linear Rpg's of it's kind i've ever played. Like exploring an open world, picking up side missions, and finding gear? Shadow run has none of this. Instead your stuck in an incredibly tiny hub area (usually just a bar, which you can't leave, though sometimes you have access to the city), which you use to hop from one mission to next, as mentioned before only a couple of these which deviate from the main storyline. There is no loot really, the only item progression you get is buying the slightly better piece of armor/weapon/decker interface from the hub store. The story was holding it's own, and was a fairly interesting murder mystery untill about halfway through when ***SPOILERS*** you suddenly have to fight a bunch of astral bugs from another dimension and save the world... somehow? It gets completely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, in other words. The combat is fairly good, but most of the time you're actually not even fighting anything so I can't reccomend the game based on the combat alone. This is not like an old school Black Isle/Bioware game like the trailers and screenshots make it look to be, so if that's what your looking for don't let this game sucker you into buying it like it did me. 4/10",

            "review_text": "It plays a lot like the new X-Com on a more personal scale, and a lot more choice when it comes to combat. Since it includes a lot of RPG elements and the Shadowrun setting, you can create a character any way you like, from a run-and-gunner to a mage slinging fireballs, to a mage slinging buffs, to a mage with a pet, or something in-between.   Some things seem unpolished or foolish, however, like running a melee combatant or a physad; The few times I tried to melee an opponent, even with a physad NPC, I got chopped into hamburger. I'm also unsure why you'd want to stick with pistols when rifles and shotguns are available, no matter how good pistols get later in the game. Maxing out pistol skills seems silly. Similarly, some of the etiquette skills are nearly useless, while some are indispensable. I suppose that's true in life as well, but it's easy to feel annoyed that you've wasted your skill points.  But the setting is fantastic, and feels like it was written by people who know the game and want to make it as authentic and immersive as possible.  ",

            "review_text": "Man, I really REALLY wanted to like this game... A big part of that is because I think the world of Shadowrun is an awesome setting for a game, I mean I've never played the tabletop game but I've heard loads about it (primarily from watching Counter Monkey) and I think the idea of mixing a Gibson-esque Cyberpunk setting with elements of more traditional western fantasy (Orks, Elves, Dragons, what have you) is a really cool concept. I'm one of those people who could never really get into games/movies/books about western medievil fantasy settings, they just always seemed kinda boring by design, seen one seen 'em all y'know? Skyrim is one of the only games with that sort of Tolkien-esque world that was able to hold my attention, and that was only because the Nordic stuff was able to overshadow it and make for a more interesting world (Snowy peaks &gt; green fields, just sayin').  But Cyberpunk? I ♥♥♥♥ing LOVE cyberpunk! I love the idea of speculating about a darker future, how technology has changed us for better or for worse, the ethics and practicalities of cybernetics and artificial intelligence, it's just got so much more meat to it. And when you take all that AND THEN add magic and elves and ♥♥♥♥? You've got the potential for some really interesting ideas and stories, and I'd absolutely love to see a game do this setting justice... but this is just not it. First, I'd like to disclaim this by clarifying that I am not entirely versed in the Shadowrun lore, I don't know how true to the books this game is, so I won't judge it one way or another in that respect. I will however say that had I not known anything at all about Shadowrun prior to playing this game I don't think I'd have gotten much from it. Things like the Sixth World and the Great Awakening are referenced but nobody ever explicitly explains what they are or how the dynamics of this world work. Why did magic come back? Where did it go? Where did all the elves, orks, and trolls come from? Who are S.T.A.R.S? What's a Doc-Wagon? None of these things are addressed, and while I understand that this is a game made for and by longtime Shadowrun fans, and as such there's going to be references that only long-time fans will necessarily understand, I get that, but It's not a good sign when I feel like I need to crack a players guide for the tabletop game just to understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on, and that's how I felt while playing much of this game.  Also, the writing in this game, or atleast the base campaign, is very... eh. I Mean it wasn't bad, it all makes sense, there were no glaring plot-holes or laughably bad exposition, but that's just the thing, it's very... okay. It's not what I'd call bad, but save a few stand out-moments it wasn't all that exceptional either. The idea of building a story around your dead friend hiring you to solve his murder from beyond the grave is an interesting idea but I've seen it done before, and far better. Also, while I definitely think that a noir-style crime drama would be the perfect framework to explore the world of Shadowrun, I just don't feel like the story presented lived up to the setting's potential. But again, this only refers to the Dead Man's Switch base campaign, I understand that many fan-made campaigns acted as a far better realizations of the Shadowrun setting, but I don't really think it's fair to include user-made content in a review like this. I think one of the major things that kills this game for me is the fact that it tries to be a throwback to old-school CRPGs, but it's completely linear, and doesn't give you the kind of freedom one would come to expect from a CRPG. There are very few optional missions or objectives to speak of, and while there are multiple ways to complete many of the objectives, much of the time it feels less like a choice, and more like a calculation (I recall one situation where a dialog choice asked me if I wanted to pay this guy 100 creds for what he knows or 50 creds. No speech check, no skills or disciplines involved, flat question of 'would you like to pay more money or less for the same information?'). The Dialogue trees in general just feel pretty cut and dry to me, very 'nice response/jerk response/witty response,' much of the time, and it just comes off as boring to me. I do however think that going text only instead of recording some half-♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting was definitely the right thing to do, in my mind CRPGs have always been about replicating the experience of reading a good book in the context of an interactive environment, and when a game like this adds unnecessary voice acting it sometimes kills the experience, at least for me, and since quite a bit of the actual written dialogue is pretty damn good despite the plot in which it takes place, I am glad they went this route. The turn-based combat is actually one aspect of this game that I thought was pretty good, I mean it's pretty much XCOM light but that's okay, it functions very well and doesn't feel out of place in the setting or genera. I do feel like melee weapons were made somewhat under-powered, which is disappointing to me as I decided to play a Street Samurai specializing in melee and shotguns. Also, this game seems to have some kind of percentage skewing problem in which you seemed to miss '70% chance' shots 80% of the time, but that might have just been my rotten luck. Other then that the combat seems to work just fine for what it is. Another aspect of this game that I found a very mixed bag is the aesthetic, the backgrounds for one thing look fantastic, they're all hand-drawn in the classic CRPG style, and they do the seemingly impossible task of making the aesthetic of a grimy, neon soaked, cyberpunk world look beautiful (all-be-it with a little too much blue-saturation for my tastes). The in-game models on the other hand... not so much. I understand, this game was kick-started, they were on a budget, and as someone who doesn't have a very beefy PC I am rather grateful that they didn't emphasize graphical fidelity and turn the game into a performance hog, but that said, I do think they could have put a little more polish into making the in-game models match the backgrounds a little better, as it stands they just kinda clash and it creates a very odd contrast, it just doesn't look very good. I have other criticisms I'd like to level at this game, the character customization was a little lacking for my tastes (especially the outfit choices), some of the character portraits look better then others, and cyberware is drastically underplayed (which is one of my favorite aspects of the cyberpunk setting, so that's especially disappointing to me), but at this point I'm nearing the level of nit-picking so I think it's about time to wrap this up. I feel like a total jerk right now, because this is a kickstarted game I'm talking about here, it's a miracle this game was even made at all, and as a budding Shadowrun fan myself I am glad that it exists and is introducing the setting to other people. However at the end of the day the mark of a good game is whether or not I feel truly engaged in it, feel self-driven in playing and enjoying it, and look forward to playing it some more as soon as I power it down, and Shdaowrun Returns just didn't do it for me. I have been informed that Dragonfall fixed many of the problems I had with Returns however, so I do intend to give that a go when I can, and I really hope that turns out to be true because Shadowrun deserves a game to truly do it justice, and this just ain't it.",

You willl most often engage in combat as part of a group.

            "review_text": "I played Shadowrun in the early 90's. I played the pen and paper RPG religously. I read the books, and to this day, the 2XS/House of the Sun series by Nigel Findley are two of my all time favorite books, period. The SNES game was intrepid, a game that I still go to every now and then because it was so much fun even when you could speedrun the thing in less than 20 minutes.  So I'll base my review of this game on why I bought it: I bought it because it is Shadowrun. In my opinion Shadowrun has only successfully been represented once in a video game, and that is the SNES iteration. Why? Because it has everything a good table of friends had when they pried open their books and began tallying up the details of their runs. Your character, a (basically) faceless dude who is slumming after a hard-knocks life of violence and heartbreak, suddenly becomes the target of a major corporate plan that by the grace of whatever god might exist, he lives when he isn't supposed to live. The 16 bit game has everything you'd expect, barring the limitations of a directional-pad and 8 buttons: A 'matrix' to hack, complete with I.C.E. to fight, optional data logs, and upgrades to the way you interface with computers scattered throughout the world. Magic to weild, nifty guns to play with, 'random' enemy encounters and a handful of bosses. Environments ranging from the urban sprawl to sewers to looming corporate towers. The 16-bit SNES Shadowrun satiated the pen and paper fan's thirst for real world recognition of a game that too often was overlooked in the shadows of Cyberpunk and D&amp;D.   As a kid, I didn't know anyone who played Shadowrun who ever dabbled in other dice rolling games. That's what set it apart, at least for me and my friends. We didn't have to squeeze into the typical stereotype of pen and paper gaming. We could walk into the hobby shops and have virtually anything at our disposal, and nobody could 'talk shop' with us because all the conventions considered 'normal' in other games just didn't apply to Shadowrun. Games could last for weeks, and to me, Shadowrun was Risk while D&amp;D looked like Candyland. There was no comparison. The lore, the possibilities in character development, there is not one single thing I can look back without remembering fondly, except for the fact that FASA handled this gem so poorly that it eventually killed it.   I am going to give this game a 9.5 out of 10. I have not enjoyed it. None of the charm I associate with Shadowrun exists in this game. I am rating it high simply because another Shadowrun product was created and released, keeping the brand alive and fresh. I'm rating it high because it has done so well, assumingly amongst people who are used to playing games that follow the same vein. I'm rating it high because I love Shadowrun, but no, I don't like this game. I'm sorry.  Maybe it isn't for me, but I hope that the critical acclaim it's recieved will lead to more Shadowrun products, and yes, I will buy them all, and hope that one of them suits my individual tastes. I don't have time anymore, nor do I have the same friends who would dedicated 8 hours of their evenings to sitting around a table arguing about that homeless guy we didn't heal who turned out to be a decker that could have helped us stall a squad of drones while we got shot up trying to escape an Orc brothel. This game here, will sit on my massive backlog and maybe at some point I'll give it a shot, if not only to see Jake's face one more time. Buy this game, support the love and heart that went into making it. If you aren't me, you'll probably love it enough to play more than a couple hours.  ",

            "review_text": "The graphics are hipster retro, but the game world feels true to the cyberpunk genre - even with the addition of magic. Once I got past the premise that allows magic, there is a lot to like from a story point of view. Thus, the edition of the game with the downloadable sound track and collection of background stories turns out to be a decent buy - but heed the warning . . . there be spoilers in the backstories. The turn-based tactical combat portion of the game is a lot of fun, and is more varied than what is on offer from the XCOM revival game.   There are some negatives. The check point based save games are pure suck, but not enough so to completely ruin the game. The leveling system may prove too limited to sustain really large community DLC projects, but that may be by design as the module that ships with the game is a little too short to justify the game's price on its own merits. This is the most legitmate criticism of the game in my opinion. There is just too little on offer for the price of the game.  Put another way, the game design lends itself to modules that are more like short stories and less like full lengh novels. Since the game only ships with one relatively short module, one does get the feeling that one has paid for full lengh novel and only received a short story in return. This is also bad news if you would prefer to carry the same character through from module to module - this just doesn't seem possible as you would effectively need to start skill development over with each module. There are hacks around this limitation, but then play balance is shot to heck.  Speaking of play balance, decking does not seem like a particularly viable solo class and the adept class is only marginally better. If you want to play as a decker or an adept, try a multi-class design instead. Longer modules might yield enough levels for the adpet class to be viable, but there is no such hope for the poor decker. There were other balance issues that have been fixed in later patches.   My impression is that the DLC community may not be large enough to produce enough quality DLC to even the 'value for dollar spent' score. However, I am not comfortable saying that community DLC won't get there . . . it just may take a very long time. If you are a frugal gamer, check back in a year or so.",

            "review_text": "So, the Shadowrun world is entirely new to me. I never played the SNES Shadowrun game, and I definitely didn't know until recently that Shadowrun started out as a Dungeon and Dragons style table top game in the late 80's/early 90's. Only a few minutes into the game, I could tell that this is a well developed universe, one that could be better appreciated by those who have been involved in the Shadowrun lore for years. Not to say I'm not impressed. Like I said, I'm completely new to this world. But that's what makes this game immediately addicting. It has it's own world and immediately pulls you right into it. Yes, you can feel like a foreigner at first, but not for long. The game starts when you receive a message from an old friend, Sam Watts, who pre-informs you of his death through a video message which is sent to you upon his death. Your mission is to investigate who killed him and find out who this 'Ripper' character is. As you investigate Sam Watts murder, you get pulled more and more into the underground world of Shadowrun, discovering more of the secrets of Sam Watts, as well as the other characters you meet.  For me, I enjoy a good RPG. Typically, I have trouble getting into turn based RPGs anymore. Despite that this game is turn based, there is a strategy element that gives it more depth. You're not just attacking, healing, and casting magic. You have to anticipate the movements of your enemies and use your surroundings to your advantage. There is also a bit of a puzzle element, too, as you must search your surroundings and use items to get past certain areas.  Shadowrun is a nice blend of fantasy with cyberpunk. I wish I could have emersed myself in this universe before, but I feel fortunate that I can experience it for the first time. So even if you are not already familiar with Shadowrun, I suggest downloading this game. It will definitely keep you hooked for hours.",

The controls are so streamlined you could replace candy crush/angry birds for your toilet gaming habits.  The Lore is solid. This game was written by someone who not just played the tabletop, but obsessed over the subject matter so long, that they could re-create the vivid world of megacorporations and magic, and they expanded on it so well, that even their truly inspired players could use their tools to tell their own cyberpunk stories.

While many of the major technical and design flaws have been excised, the base campaign is still plagued by level and story design that feels like it's just stringing you along from one too-long fight to the next. It doesn't help that your words, skills, and actions also have very little effect on either the conversation or the campaign level. It's not bad per-say, but I didn't feel terribly invested in the story or characters.  The DLC expansion 'Dragonfall' however is excellent and is everything that the base campaign should have been. It's significantly better designed, with far stronger writing, level design, and campaign structure. In the first hour, I had a far better sense of who my character was, where I was in the world, and was invested in narrative. The world feels much more vibrant and dynamic (even though there's quite a bit of illusion of false choice as is typical of the genre) than the base game.   I very highly reccomend that you purchase dragonfall along with the base game. In my opinion, the $30 price of entry for both is a better value than $15 for just the base game. The difference in quality between the two campaigns is stark, and it's very likely you'll bore yourself about a third of the way through the base game and never think to pick up the DLC if you don't buy both and you'd miss out on a great RPG.  It's also worth noting that the game has workshop support and is very friendly for creating user-made content including adventures and campaigns ala the original Neverwinter Nights.

But if you like to get your teeth into a decent storyline, turn based combat and a polished product then these games may well serve you well.   The Shadowrun universe is compelling and interesting. It's not your run of the mill fantasy/sci fi fair, it's rich deep and complex and the PDF that comes with this first game goes quite a way into giving you some of the details. Again this is for people who like to delve and read lore, those who care about backstories and where their characters will be adventuring.   The graphic style of the game I think is perfect! The detailed world is welcoming, it draws you in and the art team have done so well in bringing the Shadowrun World to lfe. It's hand drawn feel adding to its charm.   Character progression is good, although a little linear feeling, in that like most games nowadays you need to build your characters in certain ways to really get the most out of them. That said theres plenty of different ways to build your character and enouigh difference in the classes to keep you interested.  I played the first game as a Decker and had plenty to do as I progressed through the game and I played the second as a Rigger and again found the gameplay excellent.   The second game is better than the first and theres no requirement to play the first, they are standalone stories but if you were to skip this first game you would be skipping some of the best narrative there is out there today.   Harebrained schemes obviously care about their writing because it's very profesional, head and shoulders above most similar games out there.   The game isn't perfect. It's short (which can be forgiven as a first foray into a new universe - the second is MUCH longer and even better written, if thats poossible.) and it has anoying ommisions of functionality that we come to expect as game players.  You cant for example swap out inventory items between team mates, often leading to frustration because wanted items are passed to your 'stash' rather than simply handing them to another team member who has room for them! An odd choice of how to do things that sadly made it into the second game too!  Aside from some other small niggles I find it hard to say bad things abaout this game, and its sequel Dragonfall because I had so much fun playing them.  Do yourself a favour, buy them!

            "review_text": "Shadowrun Returns is an adaptation of the classic cyberpunk tabletop pen and paper RPG. Set in an alternative history future where magic has returned to the world, elves, dwarves, trolls, and orks live side by side with humans in dense urban cities, and corporations are a law unto themselves; the game centers around the segment of humanity who makes their living in the shadows, the runners. Hacker, mercenary, detective, sorcerer, where there is a job that needs doing, there will be someone willing to get paid to do it.  The game itself is a single player, turn-based strategy RPG, utilizing 3/4 isometric perspective with 3D character models set against sprite based backgrounds. The sprite backgrounds are static and well done, while the character designs are somewhat poorly textured with resolution below that which the majority of modern systems could easily handle; belying the limited budget the company had to work with. Gameplay takes the form of point and click interaction with the world map and carries over directly into combat, utilizing the same environments. Combat is somewhat klunky, as there are problems with the interaction of the courser and corners of the movement field.  The game itself is, however, merely a platform. It is in reality intended for players to build and share their own Shadowrun campaigns, and the full game editor comes included with the base game as well as a professionally developed campaign. Thanks to Steam Works, player campaigns are free, though professionally developed campaigns will be sold as DLC as they become available. Sadly there is no multiplayer option what-so-ever, crippling one of the intregral elements of the pen-and-paper game.  Overall, the game's campaign will run you around 12 hours, and is a good buy if you can get it on sale, for any enthusiast of turn-based strategy RPGs.",

Combat, when it happens, is very similar to XCOM: Enemy Unknown. Each character has a set number of action points that they can use each turn to move, shoot, cast spells, control drones, etc. Normal difficulty shouldn't pose much of a threat (I think I've been killed twice) so once you have the mechanics of it down I'd suggest playing through on Hard or better.

Another issue was probably the fact that you'd have a big advantage being a decker. A bunch of quests had only special decker options.

It certainly doesn't feel like the fluidity one finds in a real tabletop game session, but then, to expect that from a computer game is usually folly.  The heart, and meat, of the game is, rather, in its dialogue and world. For clarity, don't expect voice acting and animated cutscenes. It's more in the mein of the aging RPGs like Baldur's Gate, but even less frilly. Characters are rendered convincingly, and with their own authorial voices. The writing never worse than 'pretty good.'  But where Dead Man's Switch (the base campaign) never gets far above pretty good, and maintains a dreary linearity at all times, Dragonfall excels. Dragonfall's characters and story are much more believably written, the world more flavorful, and the story less full of deus ex machina windfalls.  Where Dead Man's Switch feels like a saturday morning cartoon, Dragonfall is more like a well-written, high-budget film. I might watch both, but you can be sure I'd much rather watch the latter.",

The battle system is very close to the one in the 2012 Xcom remake so all is good there. Where the game really shines is it's storytelling and characters.

For example, there will no longer be extra action points garnered from cybernetics, but this is compensated for via game balancing. There are new portraits to choose from (though still quite limited visual customization) but no changes to the skill trees. Games can be saved at almost every point of the game now, not just at savepoints, so that's another step forward. There are new music scores with this campaign, and they all set the mood satisfactorily for the throughout the gameplay. I still find the beats from the original campaign more to my liking, but that's personal opinion.   Some issues inherent in the original was still present in this one. Missing sprites, limitations to allocating picked-up items to teammates outside of combat and the occassional AP bug can still be encountered. However, I would not personally hold this against the expansion as this one is does seem like the developer's turn of churning out an AAA campaign using the same builder tools made available to the community.

Most of the UGC is really cool, combat is fun I think that the turn based style works quite well for the game.  The DLC so far has been fun but at times it feels like the DLC is geared more towards a decker. While this is not a down side; it does lead to some hard choices, still no matter what I am having a blast with it. I'd say if you haven't played the orginal games, or the Tabletop RPG you should give this game a chance. If you have played the orginal games or the RPG, get it! I'm hoping that we get more DLC for this game and I look forward to what UGC comes out for it.

            "review_text": "Ah Shadowrun, I'll start off by saying this: If you're into the Shadowrun universe and games like UFO: XCOM, then chances are that you'll really like Shadowrun returns.  That said, I do have some issues with the game. First and foremost, the music gets grading and tiresome fast. I've played the game for 9 hours and I had to turn the music off, they were clearly aiming for a dark electronic ambience and they do achieve it, but there are simply not enough tunes and a few of them simply sound too much alike.  A second point that I feel must be made, is the fact that the game has cut a lot of corners when making the jump from pen &amp; paper to video game. Shadowrun has always aimed for high realism, but this requires a lot of rules and a lot of depth. I understand that they had to cut a lot of these rules because otherwise nobody would've been able to play the game without 2 hours of tutorial, if not more.  Third point, there are some issues when trying to select certain points to move to in the grid, so I suggest activating the double-click feature, which ends the miss clicks.  Fourth point, the save system blows balls. The game will auto-save whenever you enter a new scene, but you are unable to manually save, this means that if you fail, you have to start all over from the very beginning of the scene, this can be especially tiresome if the encounter is 30 minutes long or you just leveled up before you died.  Fifth point is mostly mechanical, but I still feel it should be mentioned. There's an issue with scripted events that can ♥♥♥♥ you over; I'll try to explain it: When you move a character through a door and towards cover, the character will stop because and a little dialogue will play. Afterwards your character will be stuck where the dialogue started and if you're out of actions for said character, this can lead to them recieving a lead sandwich. Couple this with the fact that you're unnable to resurrect your main character if his HP hits zero and you can get rather frustrated. This wouldn't be half bad, but when you can resurrect side characters after they hit zero HP it just seems rather silly.  And finally always remember: Watch your back. Shoot straight. Conserve ammo. And never, ever, cut a deal with a dragon.",

Thankfullly, that core is there, and the story they bundle with it is solid. The problem however, lies with the overall brevity of the content given. There are remarkable storytellers out there who have written, and continue to write stories in the setting, [Do browse the UGC for the game!] but the package as a whole for the average gamer may be a little underwhelming.   Mechanically, the pieces are functional, and the experience in terms of actual gameplay is solid enough, but the pace of action and the lack of diversity in its approach may not seem the divine ambrosia to all. X-Com would be a fair parallel to make for the way the gameplay unfolds in action sequences.   Character development allows for specilization, and divesification both, but can feel stiflingly slow compared to the glut of typical loot-and-shoot games. For players who like the idea of being able to poke a few buttons thoughtlessly, toss another point into 'strength' and move on to the next fight, the system may prove unsatisfying. For players who constantly look at old saves and think 'What if I tried it with _____ build?' the depth of variety allowed is a welcome change of pace.  Graphically, there is a sense of 'days gone by', I personally found myself filled with nostalgia for the classics. The atmosphere is there, in all its dirty, decayed charm, and the experience as a whole is such that no single part of the presentation is a jarring disconnect from the rest.   At its core, it holds true to the experiences I remember as a tabletop gamer. I enjoyed and continue to enjoy it and do not regret the purchase.",

It aims to create a believable world based around the popular Shadowrun pen&amp;paper ruleset and in that it succeeds. It took me around 16h to complete the main campaign most of which was reading dialogues similar in structure to that of games like Baldur's Gate or Planescape Torment. On pure gameplay and mechanics it lacks however although you will love the combat system if you liked X-Com: Enemy Unknown. But if you really want a good game buy this and get the DLC 'Dragonfall'. It beats the maingame astronomically. While the maingame focuses purely on the main character Dragonfall introduces persistent team members for the first time that develop relationships between them and yourself over time. They even managed to create a richer and more dense story around the awakening of the Dragons with lots of plot twists and filled with morale decisions where there is simply no clear right or wrong. And when you are finished with both campaignsthere is always the workshop to come back to where you'll find a huge number of player created adventures. Shadowrun Returns has the potential to keep you engaged for several years as, so far, the devs are constantly working on new content for the game but even more so the community. Currently a number of the best modders for the game are working together on a massive scale campaign. So even if the next piece of DLC is not that great, there is still something to be looking forward to.  In short words this game is best described as a mixture of Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, X-Com and Fallout. That all combined with it's active modding community easily makes Shadowrun Returns the best 'C'RPG of this time.  It's on sale until the May 5th, so grab it. It's a steal.",

When it comes down to it, it's a completely solid game, even if it's shallow. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and feel fully satisfied with the experience, and I didn't have any trouble playing all the way through. There are certainly some notable flaws, however.  Let's start with the story, since this game relies heavily on it's writing to motivate the player. The writing and characterization is good, I felt very absorbed in the universe, but the story itself is fairly lacking. It's a shame as well, it starts out great. You got a murder mystery with a lot of interesting faces dying to be talked to, with a few twists and turns here and there. The problem is that it just doesn't developed. It feels extremely rushed. The characters are lovable and relatable to the very end, but I started skipping through dialogue that dealt with the actual plot about 2/3rds through the game. It escalates in a comical direction, with an extremely weak and one-dimensional villian. It's extremely predictable, and just plain boring. The last stretch is so typical and lackluster that I had little to no investment in the actual plight, I just wanted to see if the characters would drop some more interesting backstory about themselves. It gave me closure, but it's not memorable at all. It's just too bad, the beginning was really good, but the plot started going so fast in such a linear direction that it forgot to flesh itself out, leaving some questions unanswered and plot points underdeveloped. It got the job done, but I was hoping for more.  Where the game really shines are the characters and their own personal issues. Almost all the staple characters have their own personal motives and vendettas, and I was interested in all their stories. I enjoyed going back to base and talking to every single one of them that were willing to open their mouths. The game does a fantastic job of setting up this belonging feeling, that you're part of this organization of runners. Although, as I stated before, as the game escalates it leaves behind this deep characterization in order to fawn over its own hilariously absurd and out-of-place world-threatening dilemma.  The combat is serviceable. It's ultimately shallow and linear, there isn't a lot of variation or depth, and there are some balance issues. But it's still fun, you get to characterize some characters simply by their fighting styles. It's too easy as well, but not game-ruiningly so. It's fun, if you really like X-COM-like turn based combat, you'll probably enjoy it if you can stand it being a tad shallow.  The game is overall fun, I would recommend it. It doesn't really have any offending flaws, it just doesn't quite reach the large potential it could've. It's not particularly memorable, but it's enjoyable. I would wait for a sale, but when the price is suitable to you, I'd say to go for it just to get immersed in the world.",

Basically a party-based tactical RPG set in the cyberpunk world of Shadowrun. It really nails that futuristic, dystopian vibe I look for in this type of story. The gameplay is very enjoyable and you'll have a lot of fun leveling up your character in the main campaign. The options for character development and customization are pretty solid.  My only complaint is - the main campaign is too short. Sure, you can get Dragonfall (the expansion) for another $15, and that is much bigger than the original campaign... but the stock capaign just sort of disappointed me. I also felt like it was a bit too linear. I was expecting a LOT more side-missions and stuff like that to help me develop my character before the endgame. I wouldn't let that deter you from buying the game, but I would set aside a little extra money for that expansion - first.  Some would argue that the Workshop has player-made campaigns in case you get bored with the one that comes with the game, but I find it tedious sifting through mountains of crap to find a decent player-made campaign. Most of them suffer from the 'Oh here's part 1....part 2.... part 3... And you have to download them all seperately.. oh but im not done with part 4, and I quit working on it cause I got bored..' It's just annoying. Same thing as most any game that comes with a toolkit... most of the player developed content is half-arsed.  Anyway, I don't want the review to sound too negative because I actually did really enjoy the 20+ hours I've spent with Shadowrun Returns, and I'd recommend it to my friends - As long as they can afford to buy Dragonfall with it.",

The writing is what you want from a Shadowrun game. The combat is ersatz-XCOM Enemy Unknown.

Despite getting very interested in the storyline after the first few lines were presented to me, almost all of my excitement was lost when the Ripper was revealed. I was having fun treating DMS as a murder mystery; I was carefully examining everything and trying to figure out who the Ripper could be--I even had some evidence to support who I thought could be the Ripper--but the game pretty much points a huge sign at the real suspect from the moment they are introduced, and this is overwhelmingly disappointing.

If it was voice acted I think that would add a lot to it, but I don't fault it for that.   When you do get into combat, it plays almost exactly like XCOM. You get action points, 2 to begin with and you can either move or do an action like fight with those points during your turn. It's all turn based strategy on a grid. Overall I didn't find the combat to be very difficult, you hire a team before each mission to go with you but I played a Street Samurai and I was basically bread for combat.  That leads me to the character creation, I picked a Street Samurai as I mentioned, but you can pick from quite a variety of characters to begin with and tweak them as you play with Karma points. Like leveling up in the book RPG's. These various character choices lead to different dialogue choices and even options on the battlefield. So there is definitely variety and replayability here.  Speaking on replayability, this game also opens itself up to player stories and mods. You can download and create your own or others stories/adventures. So the game really has no end. It is certainly worth full price, but even better if you get it on sale. I would definitely recommend this game to any Cyberpunk style enthusiasts. If you liked XCOM you will like this combat system.

The other, related, complaint is lack of meaningful choices in your character. Don't have a slicer? No problem - the game gives you one. Your character is a bruiser? A smooth talker? It doesn't matter - the game will allow pretty much all paths to succeed in essentially the same ways.

It's made by some of the folks who created SR in the first place, and it definitely shows by how deeply entwined with the actual lore it is. If you like - or, like me, love - SR, you owe it to yourself to get this game.  But that's not all! The writing is top notch, with great characters and a great story with lots of neat twists and turns. The art is beautiful, making the game look like a painting come to life. And the turn-based tactical combat - while not exactly original - is very well-executed and fun to play.  Further, it's set up so you can make your own campaigns, which is pretty dang cool in my book.    The Bad   Though I understood pretty much everything that was going on in the story, understanding almost every reference and technical term that came flying my way, I'm not entirely certain it would be nearly as accessible for anyone who doesn't already know the SR rulebooks forwards and backwards or is at least somewhat familiar with the setting. This may be a foundless fear, but I figure I should mention it just in case.  Character stats were greatly simplified from the original systems, and even compared to at least one of the previous SR video games, which I do understand to a degree. But I feel they may have simplified a little bit too much, and would have welcomed a little more depth. That may be just me being a rules lawyer, tho'.    Overall   If my comments above don't speak plainly enough for themselves, I don't really have much bad to say about this game, but I fully realize that that might simply be my own pro- Shadowrun  bias. The game does have its faults, and I do wish it had a bit more depth than it does, but overall I feel that its pros far outweigh its cons, so I feel very confident in recommending it to folks.

            "review_text": "GRAPHICS: The difference between the 3D character models and the 2D backdrops and portraits really couldn't be greater. The backgrounds of this game really help set the ambiance, being very dreary, weathered, and overall unpleasant. The game occasionally contrasts this with very nice areas, but only to emphasize the feel of how dirty and unkempt the rest of the game world is. All the praise and honors I give the 2D artists I would take from the 3D designers. The characters are incredibly low-poly. Think somewhere around Goldeneye for the Nintendo 64. There definitely could have been improvements in the quality of the models. That being said, you walk into this game knowing it isn't exactly Crysis. The game's focus is in getting you into the story. And it does that exceedingly well.  REVIEW:  Overall, I am having a lot of fun playing this. The game has a really good story and a fantastic environment that really holds itself together, even with new plot points and characters introducing themselves. It's very reminiscent of Deus Ex in it's view of the not-quite-near future, and I found myself wandering all around the game, talking to the people because I wanted to, not because I had to. Conversations options are plentiful, not just a 'Yes, I will do the mission' or 'Not now'. You can be an ♥♥♥ to people, or you can kiss it. Conversation options unlock if you have a certain amount of skill points in that specific area, much like the Fallout series. If you are able to say the unlocked option, it usually helps you out with better prices or more specific information.  One of my favorite aspects of the game was the fact that not all of the game was accessible because of the class I chose. I am a hacker class, but I poured too many stat-points into combat. This locked me out of rooms I could have gained access to if I had more hacking skill. It enhances replayability by quite a bit. Another element was the different fighting styles and the enhancements you can unlock. The game seems designed to cater to specializing in one or two unique skill paths, or else you don't really get many fun abilities in combat and conversation. This is not a bad thing by any means, but there is that feeling of regret when you see a skill you really want in a skill tree you haven't invested in.  The combat is tile and turn-based. It found quite a bit like the new X-COM combat, but without permadeath, and more weapon options. It also resembles Fallout combat in some ways.  I have always found point-and-click games tedious and fetch-questy. Many of these games say to the developer 'Hey, we have a game that you could reasonably complete in a couple hours. Milk three more hours out of it.' Shadowrun Returns respects the player's time. I never noticed myself retracing my steps or stopping playing because I didn't want to 'go all the way back there' in-game. It's much more movie-esque, where the next big scene/event is at the destination, not right where you are after you collect the three Orbs of Annoyance and Plot Forgetting from three obnoxiously far-apart places in game. I'd really recommend this game, and for people who really enjoy a good story, you can't miss it.   Personally I enjoy taking my time and soaking in the game. The story is great, and I really enjoy the conversations as well as combat. This may not be your cup of tea, though. If you power through the game, you'll miss all the good stuff and find it lacking polish. But the fun of this game does not give itself away, you have to lose yourself in it to find it.  For me, 9/10.",

You really have to make true choices all along.  NPC interactions are well constructed, but not as good as in Dragonage. Graphics is still primitive, like Baldurs gate 1, with very limited interaction possibilities. The cybersamurai with an Ares Alpha still rules, but if you want more challenge, try playing a mage. Mostly you can use the skills of your team, but sometimes it is impossible to do certain things like looking at a panel in astral space despite having a mage on the team.

It is like a GM that doesnt know really how to embrace multiple possibilities. For instance, you cant change alliances, jobs, take a lot of side quests (almost none, almost), fully specialize your character (obs.: it will cost you a lot of patience, since you always need to explore, out of combat, in the front lines - a support mage doesnt explore in the front lines, period). The same problem about specialization happens in player-made content, not to mention that ranged combat is far superior than melee in this game, to have a good melee combatant, on par with a ranged, you need twice as much karma and money, I think it is pretty unballanced, but possible to fix it. One important thing to mention is: browsing through the player-made content it became pretty obvious that the publishers can make the game much more interesting in terms of choice, exploring, loot, etc. They did a very good job on the writing, but not so much on the rpg.",

First, there is no way to currently save your game during missions, which can make for some long and frustrating gameplay sessions. Secondly, there are some bugs with melee combat. On one mission, I would use a melee attack and it would not register for 10 seconds. It's a minor bug but after enough times, it is an annoyance.  All and all, for the price, I recommend it and certainly look forward to checking out some of the Steam Workshop mods.  EDIT: Be forewarned, the lack of a quick-save feature can be a major annoyance in missions. For example, during missions where you go into the Matrix, if you trigger the alarm, you will forever be hutned by more powerful foes. It is extremely annoying and chances are once you trigger it, you will not be able to overcome the alarm. The ability to save and reload would have easily negated unnecssary frustration.",

The stories are told well enough and with community mods, you'll have plenty to dive into if you really like it. So for the price is isn't a bad deal.  If that seems like a general compliment, it is. The game itself is a bit too simplistic for its own good, and fails to standout beyond its initial premise and art style. This is a game with roots in the pen and paper role-playing world making it impossible to not ask 'where is the rest of it'? Whether your character uses throwing knives, magic spells or a shotgun the gameplay is identical. Levelling feels arbitrary because the skills are almost identical for any 'specialty' and there seems to be little reason to really diversify your party. It's that mentality which does the most damage. Character customization is highly limited outside of some nice details such as cyberware that becomes visible on your character, and weapons are as bog standard as you can get and don't even seem to have unique models.  It's an average budget RPG with decent replayability and a fantastic setting. The biggest mistake here was not trying for anything better. Instead of a unique game in a unique setting, we got one that would be right at home on your cellphone next to Candy Crush. It isn't a bad game, which explains the recommendation, but there's too many oversights or just plain missed opportunities to stand out that keep this game from being much more than a casual enjoyment.",

The game also ignores some of the major mechanics of the pen-n-paper game such as essence and magic. Cyberware (machine augmentation in a character's body) lowers essence in the old game. Low essence means that one's magic rating starts reducing as well. Put in too much cyber and you'll eventually be such a weak mage that you can't light a candle with a fireball spell. In Shadowrun Returns, you can do both with only a spell cooldown modifier.   The mixed side is that the game is rather short and has a fairly linear story. A good story, but it's pretty straight to the point. I wanted more when I was done. This is a good compliment in reference to how fun the game is to play. It's a negative though in the sense that there isn't more. But for $20 (or $18 that I got it for on sale), the game ended up costing me $1/hour to play from start to finish. Of course I can download user-generated content or make my own if I so wish, so at least there's that.  Ultimately though, if you liked the old SNES version, this will be a nostalgic blast from the past. If you're a fan of the pen-n-paper game, this might annoy you, but overall it encompasses the feel of the original game.. so, give it a shot. You'll probably like it.",

            "review_text": "Although I had some doubts about Shadowrun Returns - Mitch Gitelman basically had to apologize for the 360 game that he helped produce a few years ago - the final product was certainly a pleasant surprise. For one, it actually came out and mostly delivered what was promised during the Kickstarter campaign (the extra module is still forthcoming), which is a bit of a win in and of itself.  As for the game, it plays very much like a modernized version of the isometric RPGs of old. It's linear and completely segmented into levels, to the point where the game only saves when you enter a new area, so there is no room for exploration or choice. Yes, there are dialog options that can slightly change how characters react to you, but you are being guided through the game's main storyline by the developers.   Where the game shines is the combat system, which is very evocative of the many turn-based SRPGs that have had a bit of a Renaissance in recent years. It's not quite Xcom or Fire Emblem, of course, but many of the same ideas apply. Play smart and tactically or watch as you and your party members fall to the enemy. As an aside, I'd also recommend rolling a Decker, because it gives you a chance to play through some exclusive missions with your own character rather than rely on a party member.  If you are looking for a true throwback to the CRPGs of old... let's be honest, you probably backed Wasteland or Torment. Heck, you probably own this game already as well. But if you are curious about looking back into a time when RPGs were a bit more numbers-focused and 'grognardy', Shadowrun Returns gives you a taste of what that experience was like without being too overwhelming. It's polished, pleasing to the eye, and supported by a good community. Give it a shot!",

Shadowrun Returns and its expansion pack are a welcome step back to the RPG-genre the way it was meant to be, lots of choices, great system with skills and choices making a difference, but first and foremost a very deep atmospheric experience.",

            "review_text": "A really fun turn based strategy/rpg game, that unfortunately is a bit short on its own without mods.  Basically to compare this game to a more recent game, i would compare it to x-com: enemy unknown. The big difference is that cover is not as important, and Shadowrun has a lot more rpg elements. There are several classes/races to start as (anything from mages to hackers and humans to giant mutant trolls) you can mix and match classes as you see fit (so mage samurai hacker is certainly feasible).  As far as art style i'd compare it to things like the matrix deus ex. and ghost in the shell. If those things catch your fancy then this is right up your alley. (I guess shadowrun is something that's been around for a LONG time but its never been something i've been aware of.)   The only drawback is the length of the game. It can easily be completed in around 10 hours and that just doesn't seem like a long enough game to fool around with a lot of the great RPG elements they have. The length of the game sort of punishes you for trying to make a hybrid character and forces you to develop your character along a certain path to be strong enough for the end game (I.E. No real optional missions to build up xp and money). This isn't too much of a problem as it may have been at release though because there are several mods out now that add loads of additional content and tweaks that will give you plenty of incentive to keep going with your first character or make whole new ones.   The story is pretty decent, but if you don't like reading a lot of text you may be in for a disappointment. You have to be paitent and read a lot of the dialogue to catch subtle hints on how to solve problems and get clues. I think my biggest gripe with the story once again has to do with the length of the game however. You meet a lot of really interesting characters, but it just seems like their stories drop off when they begin to get interesting, making you think 'wait is that it?' The game is set up big time for sequels/spin-offs and i'm not sure if the devs just made a short campaign and gave it to the community to develop everything or if sometime down the road they will be releasing additional campaigns of their own.  Overall a really great rpg/strategy/turn based combat game, which is just too short; but fear not mods abound that will make the game enjoyable and replayable for a long time to come.",

I miss being able to jack in and go browse all the various nodes, and explore the internet in the game, stumbling along into random systems and downloading data files, then selling the files to a data broker. Building up your skills and your body, and everything that made Shadowrun so intriguing. About the only reason I ever stopped playing the game on the sega was due to utter exhaustion, rarely boredom or frustration.  I am actually happy I got it on sale for really cheap. If I had paid full price and discovered all the things that I loved about the one on Sega missing, I'd be really ♥♥♥♥♥♥.   The graphics are nice, but there's really not a lot to do besides follow the main story line. If you're looking for a game that you can walk away from when life gets a little busy, this is a good option. It has a pretty fluid story line so far, but since my favorite parts of the original are missing, I don't feel inclined to finish it any time soon.   I feel comfortable giving this a 3 squirrels rating, since it would take at least 3 squirrels on my back deck to distract me from playing it.

I don't tend to think much of UGC and have yet to try any of it for this game, but some of it looks like it plays to the strengths of the setting: future noir, bad deals gone worse, down-on-their-luck runners trying to make good with one last job. Those words can all be used to describe the main campaign, by the way, and in the best way possible.  Combat is pretty enjoyable, and I've yet to become bored with it. The only qualm I have is that I can be in big trouble with a squish main character if/when enemies get initiative...which they often do.  Skill trees: not so much trees as slidey bars, and decently complicated without being impossible to penetrate. You need to know what you want and go for it, though.

Shadowrun's mix of fantasy and sci-fi within a bleak, corporation-run future is awesome. I loved the hand drawn character images and the general look of the game. The music, though there isn't much variety, is perfect. On the down side, the combat mechanics aren't particularly deep. They weren't bad, just not the crowning jewel of the game. Depending on your build, you have some interesting combat options, but I usually just found myself running up close and unloading. Another gripe I have is , after combat is concluded, how you're still stuck making turn based actions until you've left the scene. All in all a great game that I would recommend to anyone with similar tastes, especially for the price. I bought this along with Dragonfall for less than $10 on sale.

Shadowrun Returns has been steadily improving since it launched; originally, it was fairly buggy and only autosaves were allowed, but many of the bugs were ironed out, and new features added in that help the game to run smoother. And yes, manual saves are now in - so stop bellyaching ya whiny gits.  Concerning the base module for the game (Dead Man's Switch, or DMS for short), it serves its purpose as a model for user-generated content (UGC), but not much else. The story is standard fare, and while a few characters you meet along the way are interesting, most fall under their respective stereotypes, and none really stand out as exemplary. Except for Sam (from the SNES Shadowrun game), whom remains as a 'tribute' to the old ways. Or something. It's not great (especially when compared to the followup, Dragonfall - GET DRAGONFALL TOO DAMMIT!!), but it's not a deal-breaker either.  Combat is pretty intense when it wants to be, if only because much of the system was practically ripped from XCOM's corpse, with a few parts falling off along the way. New equipment is not researched -- it just pops up after so many story missions are completed. And instead of an endless army of mooks, you have to PAY other NPCs to run with you. This is where a large portion of your income will disappear, because (while it makes sense in-character) a lot of characters you pick up drop off after so long, leaving you hanging and having to skimp on upgrades just to afford decent support. It tends to be somewhat BS, but works out overall nearer to the end-game.  Overall, though, for the price, the game delivers quite a bit. A 10-12 hour story, decent combat, decent story, and plenty of room for people to expand upon the base game with UGC, a lot of which seems to be of decent quality. It's obvious that Hairbrained was counting a lot on the UGC to cover for what they didn't (or couldn't, perhaps) fill in, however, so if extra content isn't your thing, this may not be quite what you're looking for.",

The things that frustrate the heck out of me regarding Shadowrun Returns are the following:  * The melee animations are atrocious. If you run up and swing your sword on an enemy, it will look slow and akward. It truly makes me wonder if the developer tested this out or not - very poor presentation.  * Get used to seeing the word 'Missed' a lot.

That means that you will need to specialize and forego any benefits outside your speciality. For example, I wanted to have all the conversation options available to me, so I built up for Decking and Charisma. But then I put into Quickness so that I could use a gun. Long story short, the highest I think I needed Charisma and Intelligence/Decking was 5. And even though I put a few more into them, I couldn't hit crap with my gun. Worse is when you hire mercenaries and they can't hit bad guys, either. It's like the developer wanted to make the ability to land hits on enemies a challenge, though it is very frustrating.  * The music was an add-on purchase for me (part of an upgraded bundle). I have to say, I was ripped off. It should have been included for free.  * Also, I ran into a few bugs in the Seattle campaign. One of them was the inability to act in the Universal Brotherhood scene when we were trying to rescue Marie. Some buttons could be clicked, but no one moved. I had to reset before it locked up again (recalling the autosave).  * One feature I would have loved would have been the ability to save my character from the Seattle campaign and then bring it over to the Berlin one. Then I could keep leveling him up, so to speak. But that is not available here.  * Lastly, while not a super-huge deal, this is a text-intensive video game. Basically, it plays like a graphic novel/comic book. So the graphics and the music and the gameplay are really just supposed to lend to storyline. I suppose everything does as intended. But there are so many typos, especially towards the end of the campaign, that I was hoping the developer would find somebody in the studio to just sit down and remove them all. Just polish the thing up. But like I said, not a super-huge deal. Just reminds me of the poor melee animations, which makes it seem like the developer did not care as much for this game as I, a paying customer, do.  So if you are up for reading a game, Shadowrun Returns is of that genre. And believe me - you are going to read! There are 'pathways' in communication here: one decision you make in a conversation can lead to a different path in that conversation. However, I have noticed that all the pathways really only lead to one end result nearly all of the time. That is, it doesn't matter on what you click. If you want to be a smart-♥♥♥ character or a polite one or whatever, there are sometimes options for each. But these by and large do not affect the storyline hardly at all. There may be a few exceptions, such as deciding the fate of an antagonist. However, like I said, no matter what you choose, it is going down the same railroad. Again, this is not a huge deal, especially since this is basically just an electronic comic book. But just know what you are getting here.  As far as character customization goes, it is a bit limited. The bigger problem is that you are probably not going to build a truly useful character. If you specialize, then hope that your hired mercenaries will do their jobs. Of course, that usually means that you don't need a Summoner, healer, or a multi-class guy. (I did the whole campaign without anything but ranged attackers by my side. At Decking level 5, I did all that Matrix stuff. The only thing I missed out on were all the locked doors.) But, really, if all you want to do is kill guys, that might be the better build. (Beware of 'Missed'!).  So to close, I simply restate that Shadowrun Returns is worth about $7.50 or less for the full, complete package. The only benefit to it seems to be the ability to make your own 'maps' (scenes) and build your own campaign. However, this game does not seem to have a boatload of features, so you would probably just be making your own video game comic book, then - like writing your own graphic novel. I don't know how fun that will be for you, but all I can say is that this entire game package is not worth very much money. I will search better turn-based games, and I will regret having dropped so much cash on Shadowrun Returns. Oh, and I will say that the developer's story is a creative one.",

The only drawback that I can put out there is the fact that they still do not use 3.0 rules or any real Shadowrun rules at all it's a game specific rule set, which results in the typical samurai power house and makes most other play throughs with any other character lackluster.  You know I'm kind of sad and happy about this game. Happy that there is another Shadowrun game out there, sad that it seem broken in many ways.  Currently the community is complaining about the save feature, basically the game only has an auto save which happens every hour or more depending on how long you take in each mission. It only saves at the beginning of a mission. Additionally if you played the PnP game you can tell it's not quite the traditional PnP rules. It has it's own set of rules and not much of it makes any sense. Then theres the game breakers, there are moments in this game where you can definately see bugs pop out of no where for instance NPCs saying Hi !$race.   The big catcher is the huge overlooks aside from the failure at programing the NPCs, they forget things like giving you access to med packs for the last end game mission. Yet they give you access to every other piece of gear in the game. That kind of mistake makes the game unplayable. There are other glitches and mistakes sprinkled throughout.  There are design mistakes as well, deckers (hackers) are used or in need throughout the game however you can never use an NPC decker that you hire to trigger a skill requirement event (like opening a door). On top of that every instance in which you need a decker one is provided for you. Strength doesn't give you additional damage it gives you higher chance to hit (typically reserved for Dexiterity or some skill similar).  I could go on and on and on...I just can not recommend this game as it stands. The only people who should get this is DIE HARD Shadowrun fans who can overlook all these flaws and nonstandard RPG elements.",

You can't customise hirelings what they come with they come with, so you hire a mage your getting her spell book with her spells in to no matter how unhelpful they are.

Really, my only issues are its length (it's... not too long, and there aren't a ton of quality Workshop modules like I hoped there would be), the need for more ambient NPCs to make the world feel more real, and the lack of a proper save function (considering how much this was crowd funded for, particularly).

It’s a unique mix of gritty cyberpunk and whimsical fantasy, mechanically enhanced soldiers and mages, futuristic hackers and magical elves. It’s a weird combination, but it works. There’s a cool world here worth exploring, enhanced with atmospheric, if unmemorable, visuals and music. Unfortunately, the gameplay and story don’t quite do it justice.  This is an old-style isometric turn-based RPG, and it’s about as simple as they come. Battles are simple, your team versus a host of enemy goons, and consistently satisfying to complete. But battles are also small and take place mostly in linear corridors. With a cover system that appears useless and an accuracy system that rarely makes sense (my characters have missed shots that the system rated as having a 95% chance and above far too often), the tactics rarely amount to anything more than who can hit/stab/shoot/burn the hardest.  The game has a large number of classes, races, etiquettes, weapons, armors, and cyberware to choose from, but in combat, they all play very similarly, and the differences are mostly aesthetic. The variety is great, but it’s too bad that variety never translates into a difference in gameplay. The linear progression, lack of choice or sidequests, and similarity between classes means there is little to no replay value.  The story starts off well. It’s a basic noir-style murder mystery, held up more by the strength of its setting more than its writing, but it’s nonetheless compelling enough to carry the gameplay. It progresses standard enough, with the player following leads, interviewing suspects, battling bloodthirsty gangs, up until a certain point towards the end when the game takes a dramatic turn for the silly, and then an even more dramatic turn for the ludicrous. It remains compelling, but suspension of disbelief is broken and never repaired. You’ll meet a wide cast of characters who are for the most part likable and interesting, but lack depth, which is representative of the game’s overall problem.  It lacks depth. It has a cool setting, but that’s never satisfyingly explored. It’s a got large variety of classes and equipment, but which mostly play the same. It has decent gameplay, but it’s overly simple and linear.   But the game is also cheap, and worth a purchase if you can find it one sale. If you’re a fan of the Shadowrun universe or simple tactical RPG games, you’ll likely enjoy this. If you’re looking for something with more depth, that’s more open, with a better storyline, you should look elsewhere and be willing to spend more.  The most damning criticism of all is that you can buy the standalone DLC, Shadowrun: Dragonfall, which is an enormous improvement over this game in every facet, for the same price. There is no reason to recommend Returns over the far superior Dragonfall, which is more open, has a better storyline and characters, and better tactical combat. The developers improved so many things in Dragonfall they made Returns obsolete.",

Shadowrun Returns certainly has its flaws but this little game is absolutely worth the ride! 7/10  Pros + Writing - Some of the writing is a bit rough but overall they really captured the cyberpunk vibe well + Turn-based Combat is superb and reminds me a lot of the original Fallout games + RPG Elements are really strong and it is fun building up your character + Character Design is well done and there are a great many models to chose from + Atmosphere/Artwork - Definitely won't win any graphic awards but this game really does transport you to this dystopian future + Music is perfect for the game  Cons - Plotline - It seems like the overall story was written by different teams and then pieced together at the end. There is no consistent flow from start to finish and while each individual piece is interesting, ultimately the sum of its part is actually less than each individually. - Replayability - This was one of the more frustrating aspects of the game. The mechanics are phenomenal but the slow start to the story means that you have to wade through a lot of garbage to replay. This is a shame because the core gameplay just begs for multiple playthroughs - Ran into a few bugs with the game but only one ever forced me to restart a game - Difficulty is a little sporadic. Most of the game was a breeze with the team I put together but there was one scene in particular (the cemetary) that I ended up replaying for almost 2 hours because my team kept getting slaughtered! I actually found this scene to be far harder then the end boss.",

This weekend several Shadow run games were on special so naturally I forked over the coin.  I wasn't really sure what I was expecting to get.  Here's what I think of the game: Everywhere I read reviews about this game, the reviews claimed the combat system was very Xcom like. Bang on. Very much so.  The regular game play however, isn't. There's also -zero- recorded dialogue so there's a tonne of reading. I mean a tonne. I'm pretty sure I didn't eat or sleep until I finished this game. But the game was so short. I think I finished the original game in under 10 hours. That left me wanting for more. more more. I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic everything so the story was great. actually the story is awesome. Just don't skimp of reading.  There's some combat mechanics issues that make the game a little easier than I would have liked/expected (thankfully fixed in Dragonfall), you can't sell any of your items... This is annoying. Later in game money seems to be practically useless...  9/10  Would I suggest you buy this game? Heck yeah. But for only 10 hours of play, I would suggest you buy it when it's on sale.",

It's extremely linear, with little chance to do things later if you skip them. For example, better sell that random swag you found to the fence before he stops asking for it! 'I'll think about it [selling something to the fence]', means 'I'm not selling it' in the case of at least one item. I didn't feel in need of extra Nuyen, but still.  Combat could be explained better. I love stats in tactical games, but you can't see what cover does to hit chance, for example. Equipment isn't bountiful, and I ended up not buying much. A Decker/Rigger build might be prohibitively expensive compared to a Street Samurai.  There are several skill derived options (extra dialog &amp; interaction choices for charisma, strength, Decking,etc), but YOU, the primary character must possess the quality in order to complete it. That's expected when you are alone, but not being able to open a vault requiring skill Decking 5 when you have a hired character with Decking 5 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  ",

If you're a fan of the tabletop game, you'll appreciate all the little touches Harebrained has put into this game. Even if you aren't, they really nail oppressive, foreboding cyberpunk atmosphere. Genre purists may be put off by the lolD&amp;D fantasy elements, but the game does a good job of blending the two without making it too jarring of an Axe-Coppy mishmash.  Lots of good Workshop support means that you're not going to run out of content any time soon, either. Once I figure out how to get the editor to run on Linux I think I'll try my hand at making some UGC, too.  The bad: The graphics leave a bit to be desired -- the art is good and the textures and models are too, but there is a lot fo cut-and-paste when it comes to the animations. A lot of attack spells are literally recolored fireballs or lightning bolts. Likewise, the voice acting is so bare-bones it might as well not even be there.  The ugly: The game's biggest failing has definitely got to be the character building. The game is class-less and level-less, but it still encourages you to specialize to an uncomfortable degree. On top of that, some builds, like Decker, are so specialized that unless the campaign you're playing is specifically designed to acommodate them, you're seriously gimped. If you spend your EXP wrong you can end up pretty screwed down the line, and there is no way to go back and redistribute. Do yourself a favor and don't overwrite saves. I had to swallow my pride and dial down the difficulty setting to get past a mission right at the end of the first arc in the main campaign, 'Dead Man's Switch'.   Your call on this one, folks.",

If you're into cyberpunk/sci-fi/fantasy, this is definitely the game for you.  Just a heads up, though, if you're buying the bundle pack: Dragonfall is included in Returns as a campaign while also being in the bundle as its own game. So you may just need to buy this game and Hong Kong if you want them all, and save yourself a few extra bucks -- and don't care about the new content/improvements of the stand-alone Dragonfall.",

            "review_text": "Shadowrun Returns was an astoundingly addictive game. As a long time of fan of tabletop RPGs this game provides all that traditional character customization that I desire in a game. Each race has an area where it will excel as a focus. By investing in skills you can open new dialogue options and earn extra rewards. You won’t always know what you are about to get into when you enter a new area. There are normally several ways to solve any particular problem. As a result, building a well balanced team is imperative to completing missions.   Players of games like XCOM: Enemy Unknown and other grid based tactics games will feel right at home during combat. Combat requires you to think carefully about your moves and one wrong click can get a character killed. However, the game is somewhat more forgiving as you can revive any fallen character in the middle of battle as long as you have the right item. Combat can be problematic at times because the chance of hit seems to have some hidden values that you aren’t told about. I have missed way too many 80% hit chances for that to be the correct number. The world design and art style are high quality for the price of the game and the music is great to listen to.   There were only three major problems I had with the game. First the save game system in the main campaign is unpleasant at time. The game will auto save every time you enter an area. The problem is that there are certain levels where you have to do a 2-5 minute dialogue conversation before you enter combat. If you’re main character dies in combat you have to start the entire area over again. That includes the dialogue segment. This game needs to have a way to quick save before you go into combat so you don’t have to do the same dialogue segment multiple times.  Second, in some of the combat segments I ran into problems where an enemy would be behind some piece of terrain. Even though I could make a shot I had to hunt for the few pixels where the enemy was visible in order to select them for an attack. I would love it if there was a drop down menu of enemies that you could use target attacks.  Third, it was very frustrating that you could control your teammates outside of combat for two reasons. First you couldn’t take any items that you find on a mission (outside of combat) and give then two your teammates. As a result, I had lots of health packs I wanted to give to teammates but had to send to stashed instead. Second the player controlled characters is the one responsible for opening doors and will be the one blasted when an ambush is triggered. I want to order my companion street samurai to open the door for me.  The main campaign will probably take between 12-16 hours. There is also an active steam community producing additional campaigns. I strongly recommend Shadowrun Returns to anyone who enjoys an RPG with some heavy strategy elements.  EDIT 3/8/2014:  After Finishing Dragonfall on hard mode, I am happy to say that the developers have fixed the few reservations I had about the base game. First and foremost: they have finally implemented a save game system. In the base game I became majorly frustrated with the way the fact that if you lost is a battle you would have to restart the area from the beginning, including any dialogue segments. The ability to save at will (outside of battle) is a major improvement from the base game. (Though I do have some concerns about the ethics of making such a game necessary feature DLC.)  Story wise, Dragonfall is an all new full length campaign. It is in fact longer than the base game. I beat base game story in about 14 hours, Dragonfall took about 20. I was a little disappointed that you couldn’t import your old character at first, but after a few hours I realized that rolling up a new character made the story feel like it can stand on its own. The campaign itself feels very reminiscent of the story of Dragon Age: Origins. After the initial two missions, the world opens up to you and you have much more choice in what order you want to do the quests in.   I only have a few reservations about Dragonfall. First, while playing on hard mode I found the AI’s strategy was to through everything against your character and completely ignore your squad mates. I suppose this comes down to personal preference but I for me this seems like a pretty week strategy, though it certainly does make the game more challenging. In addition, points two and three is original review are still problems.",

The amount of activities you can do is fairly limited but there are side 'quests' you can take during certain parts of the game to gain Karma (skill points) and nuyen (cash).  The game doesn't seem like it's a full-fledged RPG with multiple quests and I wish you could manage a party. Instead you hire runners for each job but you can't really customize them or buy new weapons for them or anything. I would say that's a good description for the entire game as it stands--limited. Is it fun? Definitely. Could it stand for more features and content? Definitely.  The feel of the game is pretty cool, sort of like Blade Runner. I like the writing, it's all text-based, no voice-acting. The story is interesting and I like the exploratory aspect (again, it's limited as it's pretty linear).  The battles are fun but a bit limited (and over too fast IMO)... there's a sweet mode called Decking where you jack into the Matrix and battle digitally. I really like it but it only makes an appearance a few times (so far). Mostly you'll want to focus on ranged combat; I chose Pistols and Shotguns. Mages seem limited, if I did it again I wouldn't put any points into Willpower, instead I'd go full Cyberware. Quickness and Intelligence seem to reign supreme so far with some Strength for HP/etc.  Savegames are a bit weird... essentially you need to reach the next area (loading screen) and the game autosaves. In big missions, you access a new floor/area and then it saves. It's just the right amount of time between autosaves, about 30 mins. I do wish they just added quicksave or some other save mechanism (not during a battle, mind you, but while outside battles).  Overall it's good; it was worth the sale price I bought it at... I would love to see more content, quests, and items, so here's looking forward to expansions!",

I mean, come on! The abysmal video games of the last years (apart from the SNES game, but that is just so much hearsay) didn't do much else to entice me. Then this game came along. A lot of people complain that this game plays like it was made ten years ago, and that it would've been a bad game even by those standards. I disagree with that notion. The game is based on the ever so versatile Unity engine. 3D character models act in front of 2Dish backgrounds, with the player overlooking everything from an isometric perspective. Personally I find it pretty neat. The background is drawn with a lot of attention to details and the character models show enough of the same to tell them apart and still look unique. Sure, it doesn't have the same graphical power as a triple-A game, but it doesn't need it either. For an indie game straight out of kickstarter, it looks more than good. Soundwise it has background music appropriate for the scenery, with a mix of upbeat and eerily haunting techno. The dialogues are not voiced, but simply text-based. Which is not a dealbreaker in my opinion. The biggest complaint people seem to have about SRR is that you can't save whenever you want. The game autosaves after every scene transition. Didn't bother me one bit. It actually made the entire action even more tense. But the developers have already announced a manual save feature for the upcoming DLC.  So, do I recommend Shadowrun Returns? Yes, I do.I recommend to those people who want an easy introduction into the setting. I recommend it to the fans of Shadowrun for it finally being a decent adaptation. And I recommend it to everybody else on the grounds that it is just that: a pretty good game. ",

That being said, over the 12 hours or so of content in Deadman's Switch, you will be able to customize your character, choose your party for 'runs', and enjoy one of the best written stories in a video game.   I may be biased, but the cyberpunk genre resonates with me (Shadowrun is like Neuromancer meets Lord of the Rings...but more leaning on the sci-fi side), and this game captures that genre wonderfully.

This game is everything we ever loved about role playing turn based strategy PC game which we grow up with. Here is a quick review of 'Shadowrun Returns'   Graphics - 7/10  Simple yet richly detailed iso-metric view. Every background, every characters are so much detailed. Although, this type of graphics seems outdated in today 3D standards, it is very refreshing and enjoyable to look at the whole area, or looking at the amazing drawing of the character potriat.    Music - 6/10  Weak in overall. It does captures the environment of neo-futuristics sound but it could be improved. There is no memorable music or sound in the whole game except for the title music. Even so, everything is minimal.   Story - 8/10  This is what captures the player. The Story of Shadowrun Returns! Without spoiling anything - You start out alone in the apartment where you received a video call from your 'Best Buddy'. Turns out that its a dead video which is triggered when the person died. Now its up to you to uncover the bottom of your friend's murder (and receive $ in doing so). You will feel like you are reading a great noval and the story drives you keep playing the game one area after another.    Gameplay - 10/10  This is the heart of the 'Shadowrun Returns'. If you are fan of Turn Based strategy game like original 'Fallout', you will feel that this is everything you wished for in 'Fallout 3'. You will need a lot of strategy to think, move, shot, or get into cover. You use magic or gun or just plain melee to wack the heck out of enemy. You will have two action points as simple as that is. There is no calculation of how many action point you need to do something. You either move and shot or shot twice in one turn. All up to you. You will wish you want to have more encounters just to have a little more fan with gameplay before moving on with story line. On top of that, you have wide arrays of custormization for your characters - from choosing race to your profession. You gain karma points from making choices in game which can be used to upgrade your character skills.   Overall score - 8/10  Highly recommended to all hardcore player and fan of Turn Based Strategy games.  Pros: Great story, amazing gameplay, Awesome roleplaying turn based strategy game. Cons: No map, No stealing or fight with anyone, Music is weak.",

Graphics are decent, not great and not terrible. But lacking on a large monitor. Much of the screen space was wasted, perhaps this game was meant primarily for a tablet instead of PC.   Main campaign story was alright. Nothing spectacular, no stand out moments, no suspense, no plot twists. Just a 'good enough' story. Main campaign ran a little short, felt like the game was only just beginning and characters were just beginning to develop. Hopefully they'll release a follow up campaign/DLC continuing the story.  Little disappointing that dialogue choices had no impact on outcomes or relationships between characters.  It's expected to find spelling errors in games, but with a text-heavy game such as this, it is a little distracting.   Gameplay was enjoyable. Had a little character creation to personalize your character, which is always nice. Skill tree is varied and having options is appreciated, but there no need to branch out in skill.  Quite satisfying tearing through enemies, but a little disappointing that the cover system did not provide a whole lot of cover. Covering probably only had the slightest role in whether or not your would be hit. Found myself standing upright, away from cover, and I would be hit just about the same.  Would've been nice to see cover deteriorate as enemies shoot through the desk your character is hiding behind.  ",

It looks like a isometric rpg but if you are expecting over the top (get it?) Loot and Character customization you might have to look elsewhere.   You may ask what's the appeal in this game?  well as soon as you play a few hours in the campaign you'll notice one thing , no voice overs and thats a key point that actually will indicate what the game is, even the main campaign could have been user generated.   THIS GAME IS A MEAN TO TELL STORIES MADE BY USERS BASED ON THE SHADOWRUN LORE   Yes if you do enjoy dialogue and interactive stories this game is for you.  Other things that you might like   The combat could use some tweaking but while it lacks the features of games like XCOM , it has its charms and your team in general has more of a personality than most, and It's fun hiring a team for each mission. (you only have a permanent character usually and you hire the rest of your team each mission).  The lore even if your not familiar with it its engaging and fun, the gritty reality of cyberpunk with all the fun and magic of fantasy.  Other things that you might NOT like   If you cannot immerse yourself in the lore/story the game can feel shallow. The combat might seem simplistic especially on lower difficulties. While the models have good amount of variety some of the portraits might not suit your taste.",

For those that don't know, Shadowrun is basically a cyberpunk setting (think Blade Runner) mixed with your standard fantasy races and magic (elves, orcs, dwarves, etc). The game itself is fantastic. The turn based combat is perfect, and the storyline is quite good. Everything runs fluid and its all very fun to play. The character customization system is great, leading to what appears to be many different ways to play through the game. The game comes with an editor and supports Steam Workshop, so there is no dearth of content to download and play with. If any of that sounds remotely interesting to you I highly recommend checking this game out.  If I were to say something negative, I'd have to say that the graphics are simple and the animations basic. However, depite relative simplicity, the art style is fantastic and makes the Shadowrun universe real. Also understand that despite being relatively simple, the graphics are by no means poor. There is great detail in the world, and all the characters are distinct from one another. Nothing feels out of place, and the graphics never hinder the experience.  All-in-all I would highly recommend Shadowrun Returns",

It didn't feel like the dialogs choices would change much the adventure. But the combat phases are really cleverly done, with an IA that is vicious enough to make you fail once or twice on the biggest battles.  At the moment, the game still has this stupid saving system (checkpoints) that will make you have gaming sessions of at least 20 minutes (sometimes more if you die or if the fights last longer) Which is a bit of a shame. But the devs are working on it.  Finally, the community content can prove to be limitless as the game has a complete and open scenario éditor.

Bear in mind, I was not a fan of the early Shadowrun games at all. While I could appreciate the concept, I think the final product was a little too abitious for the time. But in our current genration, this game succeeeds at taking elements we've seen before many times, and putting a twist on them to make them feel fresh and engaging, and at the same time, familiar and comfortable. Like I said, there's some XCOM influence in there. But there's also a little bit of Baldur's Gate in there. There's a little bit of Mass Effect in there. There's a little bit of Fallout in there. There truly are some familiar elements to each aspect of Shadowrun Returns, and yet it still manages to place you in a world that feels fresh, and exciting. I can certainly tell that this game would not be for everyone... Specifically those who dont like to read large amounts of dialogue.

I've honestly tried because of my old love to the turn-based games, but my enthusiasm slowly disappeared through the game. Let's talk about them: - Autosaves only. It's especially sweet when you get some levels bugged - it's happening sometimes and you can't finish the stage because of broken trigger on events and the only way to pass - restart and play it again... - Unbelievable lack of freedom: poor interactivity of the world; mostly linear levels and quests; minimalistic/casual interface/character interactivity. I'm asked myself - what the hell? They've got such a nice and ALREADY COMPLETE universe for game, made a nice storyline, had a chance to look at the games close by genre and etc. What did they made? A lot of faults, because of being too fast or too lazy. And some of this faults can't even be shown as casual elements or features, because this mistakes are too obvious throught the game experience. - Sad news about your charcters: super casual character inventory system - you are available to manage your inventory only between the missions and there are not so much to manage at all; extra poor and fixed loot, so enemies don't have anything valuable to loot, even a money; Improving your skills and getting experience - special topic, because there are no experience, amount of enemies almost everytime are fixed and there are only karma points (skill points), which you can get... right - at the fixed places of the game, through the storyline and there are no chance for freedom or any non-storyline encounters, while you're not on the mission and even on a mission too. Approving steam workshop for this game were a good decision - users can save this game, but I've got to say - this project was born too linear and overdosed with casuality later at the development stage, which can't be cured. Anyway some people can enjoy this game - it's not an awful at all (check out positive reviews) , but full price is too much for it - popular brand helped them to have an extra cash, but it was the cost of it's profanation in eyes of the most people who really cared about it.",

This is a good game and a worthy effort and they fully fulfilled their Kickstarter promises. But I played Dragonfall Director's Cut first, and this game has a few shortcomings such as the limited RPG-ness and the necessity of decking into the Matrix, whereas Dragonfall is much more RPG and has optional decking.",

The problem is the story and its length. The setting and characters are compelling, but the story itself is bland and incredibly short. You can finish the game in about 10 hours. Ordinarily I wouldn't hold the length against a game, but here it felt like the story ended before it ever even started. Things were just starting to fall into place and then all of the sudden you are in the last mission.  To make matters worse, the modding community for Shadowrun never took off, so you're stuck essentially with the main game's short story and maybe a little extra. The amazing promise of the game just isn't realized and that's a shame.",

A lot of pretty cool things can stand unused and you will win every fight anyway (normal difficulty). It's really hard to lose, even when everything seems to ♥♥♥♥ up.

I think it averages out to good.  Now the bad:  * More than two years after release, there are still some glaring typos in plot necessary dialogues (such as extraneous words that clearly don't belong).  * Movement is often awkward and slow. After finishing an area, you'll stay in turn based combat mode; this kills a bit of the fun of exploring a floor you've cleared.  * Very linear. I found two side missions which were both very short.  * Terrible point-and-click targeting. I found myself walking past targets I meant to attack and unable to move to squares behind allies simply due to not being able to target the right square or creatures.  Overall, the good outweighs the bad. It's worth a play and will probably take you about 15 hours at a leisurely pace.",
