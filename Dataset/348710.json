The fight is just curious, It has some beautiful in it, I like how hard it is to fight against the Gold Saints and the talk in the fights, even it is repeated is cool to see how the history merge into it.  Well, the game is more than I was expecting, so yes, worth the previous price to pay for it.",

The amount of coins I earned could probably be used to purchase 1% of what the collection store has to offer. That is some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.",

It has very cheap animation, there are things you expect out of a saint seiya game, one being armour damage and blood. The show had lots of this and it really doesn't seem like a stretch to expect these things. But here's my real problem wiht the game, they cheaped out on basic things like the destruction of the pillars in the poseidon saga. It was obviously a cheaply made game to bank on nostalgia idiots like me. Don't buy it, save your money and maybe buy the dvd set. Much more fun than this. I will wait for a good saint seiya game, maybe one day I'll get one.",

            "review_text": "From the first battle I've played in this game, I couldn't stopped thinking that I've already played game with familliar gameplay. And yes, I was right - 'Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3' and '...4' have very simular gameplay. Unfortunately, when compared, this game loses almost in everything.  The first and main problem for me is story. God damn, it's BORING. I didn't watch anime (if there is) and never played any games from this universe (if there are any) and, if you think, that I shouldn't even started playing this game without doing these things, then you will be wrong. In Naruto games (which I mensioned earlier) I also haven't any information about story, characters, etc., but I still had A LOT of fun playing story mode in both of those games. I understood everything, I was involved in plot. I didn't think 'WTF is going on?' or 'Why are you saying/doing this?'. This game does not do this. In every cutscene I have to break my face with facepalms, caused by unbelievably unrealistic, epic (or, more accuratly, 'epic'), empty and, sometimes, just stupid phrases (with each 2nd of them ending with god damn exclamation point).  The second is graphics. They are mediocre, at best. According to Steam this game was released in November 2015. Naruto Shipudden 3 was released in 2013, and it somehow looks better, with better faces, than in this game.  The gameplay is, probably, where Saint Seiya is better than you-know-what. In Naruto you just mash one button to attack, sometimes turn chakra mode on and maneuver around enemy. Here... well, you do the same, but here you have not one button to attack, but two! Not much of a difference for me, but point for trying. Except for it, everything is the same: projectiles, blocks, rushing to enemy, using a bit of 'mana', throws (which you made exactly the same way: by attacking, while blocking), special mode and special super attack. About super attacks. They suck. After Naruto, where special attacks were colourful, diverse and overall beautiful, here we have several attacks, made by hero, after standing for several seconds with some constellation as a background and, of course, shouting out the name of your attack, while doing it...  In the end, I can give this game 5/10. Very mediocre game with 'not bad' battle system, 'very bad' story mode and outdated graphics.  P.S. I've used Naruto, not because I'm some kind of fanboy (as I said earlier, I haven't experienced anything from this universe, aside from 3 games in Steam), but because it's an excellent example of how to make a game, based on anime that will be interesting, immersive and fun to play for everyone, not just those, for those, who know, what they're buying.",

I looked at Guilty Gear, SF series, DragonBall etc on youtube. They just don't give me satisfaction the Seiya game does when doing the power moves.  For me this was a dream come true to be able to live the anime characters and be the one fighting and using the powers! Phoenix is bada$$!   Sure it could use more story and better graphics but the animations are soo damn good and the game plays sooo smoothly. Works on Windows10.  The bad: Come on devs... there's barely any cloth suiting up animation.... I was so looking forward to that.  At the end of the day it's so much fun for me to relive the dream. Great stress release doing the BBA attacks!",

So fairly happy to have this game with no useless priceless DLC and ... with God warriors ! Some characters seem a bit unbalanced, the ones who are not that good in the anime are better in the game and (a bit) vice versa (was disappointed by Siegfried fast like a tank and not that strong !!!!).  The gameplay is solid and easy to learn (it is not SF that s for sure ...). I would recommend it mainly for Saint Seiya's fans otherwise you ll notice the poor stories tellings and so forth, hence better knowing all before playing !",

It feels a bit more like a standard fighting game along with those anime fighter aspects to it. The character designs range from hysterical to bad*ss as f*ck. The story doesn't take too long and nets you most of the characters. The Gold Saint mode will also net you some great characters and all the while you can earn in game currency to purchase the remaining characaters and maps. Can't see much wrong with this if you enjoy anime fighters or the Saint Seiya franchise. Give it a shot.",
