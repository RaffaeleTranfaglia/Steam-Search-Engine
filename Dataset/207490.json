Rayman: Origins is an interesting game in that it is a platformer with a non human protagonist not made by Nintendo in an era where the modus operandi is generally stamping out 3rd person shooters with crewcut white boy protagonists with perplexingly green 5 o' clock shadows. The asthetic of the game is striking to say the least and it is impossible to mistake for another game. Brown and grey are simply not colors that exist in this worlds pallet and it makes everything feel bright and alive. For the proper enjoyment I would abandon the 'gotta go fast' mentality that plagues many fans of the genre, and take a slightly slower pace to enjoy the lovely atmosphere and music. Also avoid the power ups that double your electoon count unless you really like listening to the same 12 note song every 20 seconds of game play.   To put it simply: It is a nice game with a nice pace that doesn't outstay its welcome with an undersated soundtrack and visual design.",

            "review_text": "25/25 Gameplay 9/10 Fairness 10/10 Sound 15/15 Graphics 15/15 Controls 13/15 Longness  4/10 Multiplayer  Rayman Origins, the first remake of the Rayman games, is one of the best platformers I have ever seen. Why? Read this test to learn more!  First of all I want to talk about the atmosphere. You play in different worlds and their 'Dark' World types. The worlds are completly different (Forrest, African, I won't spoiler more...) and have their own music and graphics. You see Dust flying up in the African styled maps and after a time this even becomes a part of the Gameplay! The Graphics are just awesome. Hand-made worlds create a feeling of really being in the Rayman World. Together with the fitting sounds and music, this creates a very good atmosphere. Also: When I played the first levels of Rayman, it made me really happy. I played and was happy. I even had to stop myself from playing too much, because I did not want Rayman's adventure to go over too fast!  Now to the Fairness and sticked with that: The Controls.  The Controls are intuitive and easy-to-learn. After some times, you get new abilities, which though do not make the game confusing. You understand them and they stay in your brain. The game is pretty easy if you just want to play it through. You just have to get through the levels with the (sometimes not so many) checkpoints. But if you want a challenge, ok: Collect over 300, or even 350 points in the level, complete it with the best time possible or even find all of the hidden emoticons! Anyways, sometimes the not so good spreaded checkpoints are a little annoying or the unlimate pro times in the time challengers mode. You have to complete the level in a certain time (may sometimes even be 3 minutes!) AND not die AND be as fast as somehow possible. This is sometimes annoying, but I mean: it is optional, so...  I already talked about the Gameplay a bit: Different worlds, different challenges, new abilities, time trial,... The most fun though is exploring the level. If you just up in the 'wrong' way that you should and then do a bit of this and that...Hey! There is a mini game for an emoticon! And if you try to just go under the collapsing bridge...50 points in a coin! Nice done, Ubisoft! Also, you unlock new characters and racing levels with the emoticons. The characters are just for the optics, but the races are really fun! With the pursuit soundtrack you run behind a running Chest around a collapsing level, split up, come to him again, etc etc. It is just like a much better time trial mode!   Anyways, the Longness is not so long if you just play the game through without secrets, time trials and so on. You can be through in 7 hours. If you do the time trials and the other stuff, Rayman can take like 25 hours. This is up to you. For this huge difference there is a minus in the points rating though... The Multiplayer is the only thing I would critise in the game: You may play local Co Op, but there are no Local Co Op levels, and in a time in which everything is connected to the Internet, an Internet Multiplayer is actually a must-have...  TL;DR: If you want to play a platformer which makes you happy while exploring wonderful levels with atmospheric music, you should buy this game! Just if you need a Multiplayer at all costs though, you should think about getting the game.",

You have other developers outdoing you when it comes to Mario games. The game has a specific pacing and flow to it that other platformers lack. You can literally speed run without any issue through these levels after some practice. It doesn't obscure your progress or slow down your pace like those terrible side scrolling Sonic games.

Plenty of content, a whole wealth of wonky and fantastic worlds to explore, and a seemingly endless barrage of moments that just make you grin from ear to ear, this is a wonderful game. And the later levels are very challenging, so it doesn't feel like you breeze through the game.

            "review_text": "I've had Rayman Origins on the PlayStation 3 since it first came out, and it's given me hardly any disappointment. It's a fantastically fun game!  There's no need to complain about the lack of a story simply because this game is emulating the good ol' days where it was just about the gameplay and fun and not necessarily about the story.  Rayman Origins is a 2D platformer, and the control in this game is very smooth and responsive. The game boasts 60+ levels of awesomeness, and players get new powers from the nymphs as they go along. Yes, you have to win the power of punching and kicking. But that's a callback to the first game! And the third! The levels are differently themed. You will travel through jungles, oceans, mountains, frozen tundras, musical lands and even an infernal kitchen! The game is designed to be relatively easier to just get through, however the game does get a lot harder as you progress. Plus, the major challenge in the game comes from gathering the collectables. Electoons can be found in cages or won by collecting hundreds of Lums, which can be found scattered throughout the level, obtained from defeating enemies or finding Skull Coins. The Tricky Treasure levels provide the second-biggest challenge in the game, as they are frantic chase-the-chest levels where the stage pretty much falls apart even worse as you keep going, and you earn Skull Teeth from these. The boss fights are not as difficult as I expected them to be, but they still provide a good challenge. However, once you complete the game there are a few very interesting twists that I will not reveal. Play the game to find out. :P The hardest challenge, of course, comes from The Land of the Livid Dead, a level that is unlocked after gathering all 10 Skull Teeth. [EDIT: I have played this level, and GOSH DARN IT is it hard! I lost track of how many times I died just trying to complete one section of the stage, but it's a lot of fun, and worth it, too. :) ]  But it all gets a lot zanier and crazier if you bring some buddies along! Up to four players can play this game at the same time. I've only done co-op with one friend at a time (I only had 2 PS3 controllers), but even that gets nutsy after a little while. The players have free reign to slap each other without directly hurting each other (however that won't stop you from accidentally launching your buddy off the cliff or into a trap). I have, however, done a whole bunch of friend co-op in the game's sequel, Rayman Legends, and if that mayhem was any indication, you're gonna have a great time with this one!  The Windows/OS X port was done pretty well. The only gripe I have is that it doesn't appear to be optimized TOO well, as occasionally it will skip a frame or two. It's nothing terrible, but to me, it's noticeable.  Now, people may want to draw parallels to Legends. Is it better? Well... To be honest, I found Legends to be a little too easy. Origins packs more of a challenge from what I could see, and, honestly, I kinda prefer the cartoony art over the more realistic rendering of Legends. And it had an anti-climatic ending that wasn't funny like this on-- In fact, screw it. This game is miles better than Rayman Legends. To be fair, Legends has more content, but something just feels...off about that game compared to this one. This game has lots of character, bright environments, upbeat and fantastic music and, well, the entire game is amazing!  If you love platformers and/or Rayman, GET THIS GAME. You will NOT be disappointed! As you can see, I had no problem buying another copy of this game, so even if you have this game on a console already, get it for Steam.",

Gameplay is your standard 2D platformer fare. You run and jump towards the end of the level, collecting yellow 'lums' for a high score, and defeating enemies by jumping on their heads, or slapping them silly. Nothing out of the ordanary.  What makes this game stand out is just how joyful and fun it is. The graphics have a beautiful hand-painted look that call back to the old hand drawn Disney films. Levels are all unique and colorful, with environments having distinct feels. The music is catchy, with a mix of orchestral symphonies, and western country banjo playing. Levels are difficult and may take a few tries, but are nothing compared to the unrelenting difficulty PC platformers like Meat Boy usually ask. But most of all, the game is just fun to play.  TL;DR: This game is New Super Mario Brothers, but on the PC.",

            "review_text": "Beautiful. Vibrant. Humorous. Brutal. Fun. Special. To me, that is what sums up 'Rayman Origins' in the best way possible. In a time where platformers have stopped showing up as often as they did in the 90's, it's very refreshing to see and play this game. I only wonder why I did not purchase this game on it's initial release date in 2011. So, I may be late to experience the joy that is 'Rayman Origins', but I can say that it is a good quality platformer. There seems to be arguments on where in the Rayman timeline this game takes place. It was originally planned as a prequel to the original Rayman PS1 game, but it was scrapped at the last minute in favor of a new 'story' (if you can even call it that) and is now mostly viwed upon as a reboot to the original Rayman. There is no meat on the story at all; just a pile of bare bones. But, who plays a platformer for the story, anyways? Just look at Mario. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking! The colors are vibrant and the animation is as smooth as butter. It may be nice on the eyes, but don't let that fool you into thiking it's going to be an easy or friendly childs game. I would say that the vast majority of levels are set to an 'average' difficulty, but there are some that are much more unforgiving. Timing, momentum, and precision are key to succeeding these difficult areas. If you don't gain enough speed, it could lead to failure. If you run and jump, you could miss your target completely and fall to your demise. Even pressing the 'A' button to jump, or lightly tapping it for a short jump can make the difference in hopping around pointy shards. In a screen-scrolling section of the game, I went through the whole level perfectly and just one little thing messed me up completely. As I was sliding down a tunnel, the end collapsed ever so slightly just before I got to that section and bonked Rayman on the head, resulting in a restart of the whole annoying level. The solution? Pressing down on the analog stick to make Rayman slide on his belly so he won't bump his head. It's those small things that can make the difference, and you have have to be fast to react. Also, it never feels cheap; you are always in control of whatever happens. The feeling of accomplishment is very great; just as you have FINALLY succeeded on a level that you have died on over and over again. To make it a little more fair, co-op is an option and it is a blast! Co-op is not something that I am very fond of, but in this game it works very well. This game may have some of the best controls of any 2D sidescrolling platformer out there; they are top-notch, very reactive, and tight, which is a very good thing for this type of game. The music is pretty nice, too. Maybe not as atmospheric or trance-like as the Donkey Kong Country series, but very nice, funny, and relaxing all at once. The only complaint I have is that the structure of the game feels a bit inconsistent at times. Instead of the levels going from easy, easy, hard, harder; it can be more like hardest, then easiest, then hard, then easy. The same applies for boss fights. The challenge posed by these bosses holds little correlation to the sequence through which they're unlocked. You may complete an absolutely horrowing level, only to fight a more-than-easy boss. Other times, you will beat an extremely easy level only to be pitted against a very difficult boss. But, I guess this concludes my review. Rayman Origins is a game I recommend to fans of 2D platformers and players who LOVE a challenge! Absolutely anyone can pick up a controller and learn to play this game within minutes, but it takes patience to complete it!  RATING - 8/10",

It could be a combination of a few things: the music is not great (simple beats, but nothing moving, or interesting to hear), the character animations are good, but get old quickly. The protagonist (if you can call him that) does not have any real charm. He's a shell devoid of buttery flavor.   The game is long. The game gets hard, which added to my frusteration.
