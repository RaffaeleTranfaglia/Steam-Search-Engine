    "description": "A dark/sad/weird/funny first person exploration game. You play a man on his last night alive as he obsesses over a mysterious painting. More of a story game in that it emphasizes mood and character over gameplay. Takes ten minutes to play and has &quot;next-gen&quot; features like a shrimp tank.",

            "review_text": "'The Static Speaks my Name' is a great and rather unusual quick 10 minute game. There honestly is little to nothing to say about this game, as it is very short, and I'll have to add a spoiler alert to add content to this review. I'd recommend this game, it only takes about 10 minutes to play. However, be warned, this game does contain some rather dark and depressing topics.  The story is of a man so obsessed with a painting, a palm tree on a small desert island, most likely in the middle of an ocean. You play as the man's last night alive. The game itself is very short, and quite unusual, with simplistic tasks such as 'Using the bathroom' and 'Cleaning the microwave', then 'Deciding what to do with the man in the cage'.  I'll have to add a spoiler alert to these next parargraphs, as I'll tell the story, as some players didn't seem to understand it. You play as a rather odd man who's obsessed with a painting. Your tasks at the beginning require you to use the bathroom and get breakfast. However, there is nothing to eat, so the man resorts to eating 2 of his pet shrimps. The only room that you are not required to use is filled with the same painting all over the walls. Your character seems to have studied and cracked down on everything this simplistic palm tree painting has to offer; it'd also seem likely that your character has made some crazy conspiricies and observations.  One of your last taks is to decide what to do with the man in your cage. Before this, you have no understanding of this man in a cage. You're forced to pick up your keys (hung up next to your coat on a rack) and use them to open a bookcase that reveals a safe, in which a man, most likely the artist of your obsessed painting, is locked in a cage. You unlock the cage and then 'put yourself to rest', in which you open a door in your room which previously would've said 'not yet..' when you tried to interact with it. In this room is a noose, you commit suicide and wake up in a dark space filled with static clouds, all of which show names, ages and way of suicide when you get close to them. The game ends.",

I dont bother washing my hands afterwards and immediately go looking for food. I have no food, so I eat a couple innocent shrimp living in a fish tank. Presumably the taste of urine lingering on my hands helps with the flavor of raw shrimp. Then, I chat online with some live action pay per view porn chick. I follow that up by cleaning the microwave, lol. Then, I electrocute some poor saps I have imprisoned in my home (which I have also boarded up completely). then I go into the bedroom closet and hang myself.  Not sure how this game is supposed to help with depression or whatever, but it is 10 minutes and free.   I give it 5.5 WTF's out of 10.   Wash your damned hands in the afterlife!",

Yeah, I get the themes. However, these topics are brought up without the least attempt at investigating them. This game is not entirely unlike communicating via tumblr gifs. Without much substance.

And what a life it is. At first things seem normal enough. You wake up in your one bedroom dwelling in which you spend the entire, very short, game . Simple objectives given on the screen. Go to the bathrooom. Eat breakfast. Normal stuff. And then... some not so normal stuff.    The enviroment that seems so normal when you first start playing contains hints of how very sad and lonely this life you find yourself in really is. The empty fridge, the state of the doors and windows, the fact that apparently you consider a chat sex bot to be one of your best friends, the note you've written to your mom... It becomes clear that you are inhabiting someone whose life has gone very, very wrong. And then... things get much worse.  There are no jump scares in this game. No monsters hunt you. No gunfire, magic spells, or ghosts. And yet, it manages to be genuinely creepy and disturbing. Give this one a pass if a graphic portrayal of depression, mental illness, murder, and suicide might be a trigger for your own burdens. For everyone else, I think it's worth checking how successful a very non-standard game can be so successful at what it clearly sets out to do.  No number rating because how the heck do you even start to quantify something like that in a game like this?",

            "review_text": "Suicide note  (It should be a review for game website, which no longer exists, so I decided to put it here anyway. I'm open for offers btw.)  If I would say that “the static speaks my name” is ♥♥♥♥/fantastic, it would be as much a review as tssmn is actually a game. Yes, it would intrigue you by the title and then jump right to the point, but then would find itself shallow and without an ability to perform something meaningful. And more importantly it won’t waste too much of your precious time and would offer some point of view.  If free game takes you 15 minutes to beat it (only because of mine desperate attempts to find any hidden way or/and meaning), how could you criticize it?! So tssmn cares about your wallet and time (which is money, so its care is twice beneficial), but game can’t offer anything except that and “shocking” thematic. And this is disappointing, because it got tightness in the air, game like that desperately needs, but catharsis of the story is too weak to sympathize, it just lead you to inevitable. Do you really want to kill yourself only because you found the rope and someone told you so? Do you really want to play the game only because it’s free and short? Well, maybe you do, how could I know.  It might be easily the end of my review, but the journalistic rule says to avoid rhetorical questions in the end of any article, so let’s talk about theme of the game, we got no choice, because other aspects of it are not worth a space on the paper (screen? nevermind), as I mentioned before. So tssmn explores dark side of human consciousness as well as “Depression Quest” which made a lot of noise some time ago, but it was nothing to do with its theme or quality. DQ reminds some physiological test, while tssmn is more like a manual; it isn’t asking any whys. Sadly both games failed to deliver gameplay-wise mumbling something about importance of its ideas. You really need to get your thoughts straight before public debate on such topics, because loud statement couldn’t substitute story, game mechanics and gameplay itself. We all know that those things exist, although sometimes afraid to talk about them, would you mind to make actual game about it? Oh my, rhetorical question again. So it was inevitable as well.",

I like to believe that this game depicts the life of someone who is either depressed, a schitzsofrenic, or any other emotional, mental, or other problem. for some people, this game really hits home, or opens the players eyes to the life that some people life. not going out of the house, weird quirks and maybe even scycotic things are part of some peoples every day life.

The small apartment in which you are confined is littered with evidence of the character's obsessive search for hidden meaning in the mundane - just as the title says.  Comparisons to Gone Home are certainly valid. Both titles focus on atmosphere and mystery. Both feature a voiceless protagonist wandering a (seemingly) empty home. But where Gone Home tells a story, The Static Speaks My Name simply presents a premise, and ends as quickly and strangely as it began.  There are no options in the game, no way to invert the mouse or adjust video settings. The music is appropriately unsettling. The Unity art assets are bland and outdated.

This is also coming from a person who has seen and experienced true horror and darkness first hand... this game strives to mock the seriousness of being in such a state of mind. There is nothing good about this, even if you're of like mind as the developers.",

It will likely be traumatic and and an experience that you will regret. This game is a 'walking simulator' which describes the final minutes of the 31 year old Jacob Ernholtz. The game gives you objectives which start off as normal things which people like you and I might do in the morning, however suddenly descend into objectives of a madman. These objectives effectively put you into the mind of Mr. Ernholtz and show what he deems to be of importance. eventually you are given a final objective. The harrowing and shocking story of Ernholtz is a fantastic example of story-telling via enviroment as merely Ernholtz's house tells a detailed story of how he descended into his current state. This is one of the best examples of storytelling in a video game that I've ever seen and a strong example of why games need not be long to be good, as seen by my 15 minute playtime. Within these 15 minutes, the game never breaks immersion by dumping exposition or doing something unrealistic.However, the graphics can be distracting and in most resolutions, text won't fit. The music is atmopsheric and slightly eerie creating an unsettled feeling throughout. In conclusion, This game is a must play, unless you are touchy about the themes of suicide and depression.",

If anyone still thinks games are not art..this is an artistic piece, despite how awful it may seem, as art is to depict and elicit emotions..Art is pain in every way imaginable...I guess I can start with that: The painting.  I took a good few minutes to sit and read all the notes and things written with the copies of the paintings. I analyzed every copy of it, all over the house and room...I myself am curious about the painting, and the protagonist's obsession with it...As an art college student, the only major issue within the painting for me was the inconsitent shadows from the trees - light does not act that way...but as for anything else..Who are we to say that island actually exists, like the character assumed? Anyone can paint an island with palms. I find the different prints of the painting to be very interesting..I have many questions about the painting and obsession with said painting.  To continue my questions...the man in the cage..I assume he was the missing painter the news article on the fridge mentioned..I assume the character kidnapped him to interrogate him on the background of the painting, but who can say..?  While the creator speaks of the game being centered around mood and character...he did a fine job of that. The dark, odd house..the music and sounds...just, generally..even if silent, the game holds this cold, bleak, shivering atmosphere, especially for someone like me who knows exactly what depression and suicidal contemplation feels like...this game perfectly captures the idea of 'atmosphere'...One of my professors once said 'If you watch a horror movie on mute, it's almost comical because the sound makes the terror!'..he is right to a degree but as I said...this game..this experience...has an atmosphere all its own to the point that the very title itself can make you shudder, when you think deeply on this occurance.  As for the whole suicide thing..I don't know what to even say...As someone who suffers from Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety, social anxiety, an inferiority complex, and other illnesses, I have many times experienced the pull of suicide...I have never attempted, but I very well understand the pit of darkness that suicidal thoughts are. I understand how painful, cold, and terrifying it is...how alone it feels...yet how, in a sense, you feel watched, if not haunted and attacked...by your own imagination. It is painful to watch this game unfold, to be the omnipresent being that forces the character to hang themselves in order for the game to progress and complete...it's horrifying to be forced to cause and witness such an abyssal action. I find this game a necessary experience no matter how awful one may feel, because too many people in our society believe depression is fake or that people need to 'get over it'...so many people treat mental illness like a joke, when it clearly is one of the most deadly and destructive things in existence...  The static knows and speaks all of our names. We all have nooses on us. This game is haunting and will leave you with questions, regrets, contemplation of life and existence itself including of yourself...  I always feared that horrid television static....",

There is a real Devyn Waitt, but he directed a movie of the same name (I have not seen said movie, and it looks completly unrelated). However, there is a poem titled, 'Not waving but Drowning' by a Stevie Smith. The poem is much more relatable to this game.   Nobody heard him, the dead man.  But still he lay moaning: I was much further out than you thought And not waving but drowning.   Poor chap, he always loved larking And now he's dead.  It must have been too cold for him his heart gave way.  They said   Oh, no no no no. It was too cold always.  {Still the dead one lay moaning}  I was much too far out all my life.  And not waving but drowning.   Is there a metaphorical connection between drowning in the sea and the onset depression leading up to suicide?  Perhaps the island in the paining represents that faraway thing that could save the player from suicide: Only the island could save him from drowning. But repetivly questioning the island (the relief from the pain) could only make one more miserable, and more insane.",

Something really simple, enough to be considered a souveneir. And yet, the character you assume makes something big out of it.  Maybe the creator tried to reproduce the same sense out of the game: make it simple enough, but considering what the other can make of it.

Yes, it's free - and so is stabbing sticks into your eyes. Look at it like the result of an assignment from some Arts class when a hipster has some Unity skills.  There's so little to do and in such a railroad that you will spend more time trying to find something MORE to do besides the half a dozen 'tasks' you're self-assigned than anything else - and your only success will be reading a few notes that give very slight insight into the obsessive mind of the guy you're playing.  So many positive reviews use detailed descriptions with lots of fancy words about how it made them feel... and all I can get out of that is that we have a lot of hipsty Arts majors who are way too much into the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t 'modern art' is, reading deeply into a few meaningless splotches of paint crossed by some random lines.  The game does has a message, although an extremely negative and not necessarily realistic one. No, the only way out of obsession isn't suicide. Maybe if there was an actual game, content to make you go a bit deeper into the mind of the character, stuff that made you try to see it through their obsessive eyes, get a little into madness yourself and go as far as agreeing to some of the bizarre links the guy made... maybe it could be the kind of experience people are describing. Maybe you would even agree that for this guy, the only way out was suicide.  But as it is, you're left to 'imagine' it... i.e, fill in all the major gaps in story that just don't exist. Might that be a way to tell a story? I guess, for some people, I already mentioned the kind. I have no problem using my imagination, but this 'you're a guy who's obsessing over something and will kill himself within 5 minutes... imagine the rest' is just going way overboard. If this was meant to be a ridiculously short interactive message, it does an alright job, even if the message is a bit way too open to interpretation to be said to have an actual objective.

Or maybe there is. If a meaning exists, I surely haven't slightest idea of what it is. Not gonna pretend that I understood it.  Nevertheless, I think the objective of the developer may just be to change the idealization of how losing control of our lives looks like, to depict how raw and twisted the things can turn out to be, to show us that even when all goes wrong, we might as well start cleaning the microwave. Overall, it's not bad. But I don't think it's good either.  Also, do not get attached to your pets.",

Once the game was over, it took my a while to process what just happened, and in doing so, brighten my life just a bit. I felt a little better about some of my issues. I don't know if that was intended from the creator, but it happened. Now every once in a while I look back and remember how crazy this game was and the feels it gave me, and I think 'I'm glad I played that.' I don't recomend this to anyone who can't accept depression and anxiety, or to those who have never had to deal with it such emotions (personally or from someone close to you).
