Immerse yourself in the original survival horror game running around for hours trying to find a key for the door you need to open, then forgetting where the door was in the first place. Nice graphics even for its age, 100% achievements is very time consuming due to the fact you have to complete the game with just a knife, and you have to stab a giant snake around one million times and dying can be very demoralising.

            "review_text": "I can honestly say, this is the best 'remaster' of any game I've ever played. Graphics look really good for such an old game (you can mostly tell from the background textures how old it is, but the characters and animations look very good, only the videos seem to have been re-used 1:1 and look very out-dated and low-res). Wide-screen support included of course. Controls are fully customisable and intuitive (only played with mouse &amp; keyboard so far, can't talk about controller, but m&amp;kb work perfectly). Steamworks (achievements, trading cards etc) included and working fine.  So about the game: If you haven't played it yet, well you've certainly missed one of the best - if not THE best - survival horror games. Ammo is scarce, saving is limited. That helps to increase an already scary atmosphere and will keep you on your toes throughout. This is one of the few games that actually manage to scare me, because the atmosphere is just brilliant.  Only thing I miss are the trashy videos of the original release (the ones with amateur actors, not the animated ones from the Gamecube remake which have been used here - look them up on YT if you don't know them!).  That and for some reason the creepy 'RESIDENT EVIL' voice-over only appears when starting a new game, not when you load one. This last issue seriously needs to be fixed. Also it's not the same voice-over from the old version, which was creepier. So as you can see, if I have time to criticize the game for those issues then there can't be much else to criticize. 8.5/10, fully recommended!",

            "review_text": "Would I recommend you buy the Resident Evil remake? Hell yes, and here is why.  This was a great game back on the PS1, to have it remasterd at 60 FPS for the PC? Yeeaaa boi. The gameplay was vastly improved, It feels alot sharper now to rotate and turn your character, aiming aswell feels better as I rarely have the momments back in the PS1 game were the shots could oddly miss when you were aiming right at the enemy.  For people who have never played the old game, The game plays out like this. You pick from two characters, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield. Each of these characters have there own Pros and Cons and progress slightly differant through the game. I would strongly suggest playing as Jill for your first time playthrough as she is argueabley the easiest character out of the two and perfect for a first time playthrough.  The two characters are apart of S.T.A.R.S Alpha team and their mission is to find Bravo team who went missing during an investigation into the odd and mysterous murder cases poping up around Raccoon city. ♥♥♥♥ hit the fan pretty quick as Alpha team located Bravo team's chopper and the pilots were found dead. Alpha team had to leg it for the mansion close by as they were attacked by what seemed to be a pack of wild dogs.  Now that you're in the mansion playing as your character of choice, Your character is viewed by a camra positioned in each room. standing in differant places within the room will sometimes change the camra angle to allow you sight around the next corner. You will be collecting differant kinds of items for your survival from ammunition, healing items and 'defense items' which play a big role in preventing zombies from biteing you if they manage to grab you. Sometimes there are items which play key roles in progressing around the mansion from keys and other miscellaneous objects which sometimes upon examination can reveal another use are a clue to a puzzle.   What you will find in the negative reviews however, are people who ♥♥♥♥♥ about the camra angles being 'limited' They are to a certain extent but never are they an issue to the gameplay, I've found the camra angles to be positioned quite well to see were I can move, aim, and look for enemies. What these camra angles do however to the players experiance, is actually by limiting the view make you rely on your sense of hearing to listen for footsteps and other odd noises which adds to the horrer experiance. There are countless momments they take full advantage of this, and I won't ruin them for you but I can garntee they will give you a rush of urgancy to survive.  Now that I lightly covered the basics of the game, I'd like to talk about the performance and the visuals of the game. I like them, there dark and gritty and the lighting really helps build up a great atmosphere. It kinda made me forget I played the oldier game for a momment and there were times I forgot all about the encounter, to yet again be jump scared by it all over again.  To summarize this all, the Pros and cons with this game would be  PROS+  +Great looking and updated visuals +Rewarding and great gameplay to the player +Full controller support (I can't really say about Mouse and Keyboard, I used an Xbox one controller) +Good sound design backed up with a great soundtrack  CONS-  -Backtracking alot through the mansion to manage items can sometimes be a pain, but easy to get over. -Sometimes and I mean.. very Rarely, when I enterd a room I might get very low frame rate for about a second and it soon stoped. Not really a major issue, but meh. Something I had anyway  I can't really think of much cons for this game, It kinda just aims for what it wants and hits it with flying colors in my opinion. So I hope my review of this game helps in your choice of buying the game are not.",

            "review_text": "So I'll get this first part out of the way for everyone who's already played REmake for Gamecube/Wii: port runs great. There's an issue with some Nvidia/AMD cards that runs cutscenes in slow-motion, but you can fix it by setting the framerate to variable, and turning off vsync should help as well. More fixes are addresses in discussion.  For those of you that played RE back in the PS days but never owned a Nintendo product: REmake is worth your time and effort, the differences aren't just cosmetic, Capcom tightened up gameplay and enemy types to make sure you're not having an easy time.  And now for those of you who've never played Resident Evil: I'm not sure how best I can put this to you, but I think this gets the point across: This game is one of a kind.   There was nothing like Resident Evil before 1996, and despite the fact that was the first game to be classified as a 'survival horror', despite the fact that hundreds of horror games have come out since then, despite the fact that the market today is flooded with games of similar eerie atmosphere and setting, there hasn't been anything like RE since. Except of course for its sequels, until the remake came out in 2002.   This game will scare you and you will still want to play it. You'll figure out how to dodge zombies, drop attack dogs, kill giant plant monsters, fry spiteful fish, and you'll feel good about being in control for a few minutes, but then it's back to the mansion, back to running into something that could kill you unless you use your precious ammunition. There's something around the corner, you can hear its breathing. You don't have the advantage of moving the camera around so that you see it before it sees you, you're bound by the beautifully composed camera frame. The music is haunting and will put you on edge, but the alternative is no music at all, just the sound your footsteps in an empty room. Those *are* your footsteps, right?  You will learn not to shoot. You will learn that two guns mean two ammo types and maybe that crappy knife is better for your inventory. You will learn to look at a map and know instinctively which hall, room, balcony or yard that shape represents. You will learn not to pick up every item you see, even health and ammo. You will learn that never using the kerosene will cost you dearly. You will learn how to survive.   Or you'll die, a lot, and you'll learn not to do what you did next time. The point I'm getting at here is, rotate your saves.  Enter the Survival Horror c:&lt;",

            "review_text": "In the depths of time - in the far off year of 1996 - horror games were something of a novelty.  Alone In The Dark ,  Clock Tower , and  Phantasmagoria  were on the scene and while they certainly drew attention to the niche, they were by no means indicative of how far you could take the theme.  Luckily, Capcom seized upon the opening and brought us a lovely little number called - rather unimaginitively -  Biohazard ; it spawned a cult following and over a dozen sequels/prequels/tangents. In the midst of all the zombie-fighting fervor, the less accurately but more interestingly named  Resident Evil  came to be remade for the  Nintendo GameCube  and all was right with the world... In that whole 'mansion filled with unspeakable horrors' kind of way.  Fast forward over a decade and the nearly-forgotten remake of one of the most classic games in the 3D tradition has been HD remastered, had its' controls updated, and been ported to every platform imaginable. While the game is still clearly showing its' age, it more than makes up for it with its' aura of nostalgia.  TLDR:  Resident Evil  is one of the cornerstone classics of the Survival Horror genre and it deserves to be played, even if it feels a bit old and rough around the edges.",

The remake itself isn't just a 'pretty picture exact replica' remake, it's actually got added extra content with more lore and it's also great lore too, plus there is new game modes and challenges, new outfits, etc. However, this is not the regular remake, this is the 'HD REMASTER' of the remake. So for all of us who always wanted a gamecube and never got the chance to play the 'remake', well, this is it! Except they've not only given us an exact original copy of REmake, they've given us an HD REMASTER of the REmake. Which is icing on top of the cake.  Had a great time playing this. It's actually got quite a few different puzzles changed from the original, so sometimes my memories played tricks with this game, as I know what to do in the original, but in this I did have some slight confusion at times due to my misleading memory of the old game. However, some things are still very much similar. But overall, I love the changes. It keeps you a bit more on your toes and definitely gives it a fresh change.  This is definitely my second/tied for favourite along with original Resident Evil (thanks to nostalgia goggles).",

I am playing with Jill on easiest and 9 hours in still have a lot to explore and beat (based on achievements), although it is possible to complete the game within 3 hours! I am enjoying it although am finding some game mechanics irratating like only being able to carry 8 items and having limited saves. This means I have to trapse around fiddiling with items and then get killed before realising I have to trapse around the same places again. This isn't that bad though as the environment changes throughout the game, so re-visiting places is actually useful, plus the next time you are more prepared for surprises. I had one major jumping incident due to smashed glass, and there are always a scare or two to throw at you. Ammo is limited, which is a pain when you waste a load on something that can't be killed. The graphics are really nice and the story is engaging. Basically this game is reminding me that I am not actually that good at computers games but enjoy them anyway.",

Be aware that you will need to read documents that you collect and solve puzzles in order to proceed through the game or to make your life easier. I think that one of the best parts of the games is that you're not bombarded by a seemlessly infinite number of enemies. Use your resources (healing items and ammunition) wisely and choose your paths based on how they may affect your resources. There will be backtracking so pay attention to the environment so you know what you may need to bring along.  I didn't have any technical problems with the game. No crashes and the audio and visual experience was good.  Do know that the game's difficulty levels are basically Normal, Easy, and Very Easy; I didn't think about this, played through on Easy and ended up missing out on the final boss fight; I didn't know that would happen. I suppose I need to play on Normal difficulty to get the final boss fight.  tl;dr: This is a classic and an extremely well-done port and definitely worth the initial price.",

They made the presentation and graphics up-to-date while keeping the atmosphere of the original game. This is the most important, even though a lot of 'HD remakes' failed to do it (khm SIlent Hill khm). But did they fix anything the original game had issues with? Not like they had much to fix. The only bad things about it were the clunky controlls and sometimes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera views, even though these became basically signature elements of the old school survival horror games. First off, the fixed camera angles force the type of controls those games have, if you had the traditional up-left-down-right unchanged it would be very confusing. The traditional way is that you go in the direction you face with, turning by the side keys and go backwards with down. The problem with this was always the fact that you turn slowly, since most of the time it has to be precise, but sometimes you need it to be fast because of enemies and curvy areas.  They tried a method where you always effectively go forwards, every key turns and moves you character instantly and the directions change based on the camera angle. It works fine when you have to go fast, except the fact that the update of the directions is weird. So every time the view changes, sometimes your character just turns back and goes back to the other view, sometimes it works intended and you continue going to your original direction. With better direction updating it could've been awesome, was a good effort though. The camera angles are still ♥♥♥♥♥♥ occasionally, but I didn't expect that those will be gone.  Other than this there isn't much to say. They maybe should've stuck to the bad voice acting, because that was hilarious in the original game. It's not great by any means, but the ridiculously overacted and read up lines are unfortunately gone. In exchange, the game has a more serious tone.  It's a great remake, it doesn't matter if you have played the original, you should play this if you like horror games. It's a classic.",

I was never sure where to start with so many different entries; so when I saw they had remastered the original I decided to try it out, It was a great experience. The old gameplay is a little to get used to with the tank controls and claustraphobic camera angles, but after beating the game on the highest difficulty I can honestly say the alternate controls would feel wierd. The combats interesting with only 3 angles to aim middle high or low with a certain random chance of critical strike or headshots.When possible combat is to actually be avoided. It's very risky especially since it only take 2-3 hits to kill your character. Also something I wasn't expecting out of this game but got was a sort of metroidvania feel exploring the spooky mansion or other areas finding keys to unlock new areas to find new guns or parts to other puzzles. Speaking of puzzles they are both intelligent enough to challenge the player yet simple enough to be enjoyable. Throughout the game you will revisit parts of the mansion and discover new secrets. Possibly the most impressive thing in my opinion is how the developers continually up teh ante throughout the game; for example that route you cleared of zombies through the mansion? well now that you've progressed past a certain point in the game a twist happens which fills said route with new terrifying enemies. Truly Resident Evil has stood up to time I had no nostalgia glasses for this game having never played it before, yet enjoyed it imenesely nonetheless. I can see why people complain about the new resident evils because they do truly pale in comparison from my experience. The sole feature of this game that has not stood up well is the characters/acting. To be honest they feel ridiculous and the voice acting is also very campy, but it has it's own apeal in a B-movie sort of way.",

This game is amazing in a lot of ways, and I wished that they kept this style of gameplay when they made the latest Resident Evil games. Don't get me wrong I loved Resident Evil 4 and 5, but I would still prefer the style with set camera angles, puzzles in pretty much every room you go in, and only able to carry 6 items so the decision on what to take with you needs some thought.   The HD REMASTER in my opinion is nothing incredible as to where it's a whole new outlook of a game, but some things were added in the game as for instance:  1.) You can change the aspect ratio to either widescreen, or the 4:3 original ratios. 2.) Character detail has been improved, but nothing to drastic and changing Chris and Jill's outfit to the most recent Resident Evil game they were in. 3.) Changing the FPS to either 30 or 60, but I prefer 60 because it is so smooth and I love it.   As for gameplay, I said before its back to the older style of Resident Evil which I love. For newcomers though who never played Resident Evil, this could be a little frustrating with awkward camera angles, constant running to the item box to swap items, or CRIMSON HEADS!!   Some advice for newcomers who may be interested in this game: 1.) Maybe use a controller? 2.) Conserve ammo and use it when necessary. 3.) Check the map frequently; if the room is highlighted red then there are still items there, if green then the room has no items left. 4.) Save frequently but watch you ink ribbons because how many ribbons you have is how many times you can save the game. 5.) Don't let the camera angles discourage you from this game, you'll get used to it. 6.) SURVIVE!!  ",

I run at 60fps and 1920x 1080P with everything maxed out with a near solid 60fps bearing in mind i use an old GTX 580 1.5GB for this game the perfromance has been superb so far i did notice tiny slow motion in the save game rooms sometimes but it only lasted 1.5 seconds. I believe it was due to the lighting effects taxing my old graphics card as from what i hear this game has a much higher internal resolution then 1080P which is on be default you could change it in the TXT file to improve framerate but you could encounter crashes and a not so good looking game  Pros Great looking game rendered well Sounds Music sounds better higher quality i'm guesssing Capcom is using more modern sound system 60FPS is great to see as i remember the old game was 30FPS Higher resolution 1920 x 1080 is miles better then 480I New sound effects on the introduction video guns sound better new added Dog barks New 360 control system although i use the classic tank control but others like the new updated version. New costumes have been added to this version with the inclusion of BSAA Chris And Jill also rebecca i believe has an alternative costume.  Cons Sometimes you may encounter slow motion sequences when saving or exiting a item box for me it happened randomly and only lasted 1 to 2 seconds but it may be due to my graphics card but was annoying because when i was saving my game it took a good 15 seconds to finish when i exit the room the game was fine could be glitch or my hardware i'm uncertain this happened 4 times overall in one playthrough  Skipping doors it would be great to be able to skip the door animation as i do lots of speedrunning i love the classic design but a option would have been prefaired you spend a good 40% of this game stuck in door animation  Mods would be cool to be able to install mods to this game and make it better although this is unlikely  Conclusion  This is a great game that has clearly had a great deal of time and effort put into remastering it. It has been polished well and looks good for a 2015 game the sound and framerate sounds better and runs better so overal pleased with my purchase the only thing that would have been better is if there was more content to unlock and mod support  Overall  8.5 /10   Windows 10 Ultimate (64 Bit ) FX 8320 Overclocked to 4.0GHZ 8GB DDR3 2400MHZ 128GB Toshiba SSD 2000GB Hardrive GTX 580 1.5GB  Thanks  Joe",

            "review_text": " SUMMARY  An enjoyably tense and finely crafted remake that enhances the strengths of the original, whilst throwing in surprises of it's own. It's a welcome revisit to how survival horror use to be and a must buy for a piece of gaming history.   FULL REVIEW  As a preamble, having played the original back in the late nineties and having fond memories of the original series (RE 1, 2 &amp; 3) my review will undoubtedly be coloured by nostalgia, so take this into consideration whilst I share my thoughts.  The fixed camera angles and (updated) tank controls that defined the original series make a return, and with it, it's strengths and weaknesses. I personally loved the tension this style creates, despite the fumbling that occurs when switching direction on the pad after a camera transition. But some who are more used to being empowered in more modern games by quicker, more precise movement and 360 degree camera control may find this highly restrictive.  The creepy atmosphere has certainly been enhanced from the original with far greater visual fidelity, more use of animation and effective use of lighting, with only a minor quibble (for those who care) being that the pre-rendered backgrounds were clearly not completely optimized for 1080p or greater resolutions. But despite this, the game still looks gorgeous despite it's age, due to its excellent art direction.  The music varies a great deal in presence, and are a carefully chosen to communicate safety or danger depending on the location and current situation. Half the time, the music is near absent to let the player soak up that sweet tension. Overall, it compliments the eerie atmosphere nicely.  The sound effects are well done, being an indispensable tool to help gauge distance, state (alive or hopefully dying) and type of biohazard hobbling or racing towards you down the corridor, painfully beyond the reach of the camera angle.  And of course, whether intentional or not, to provide as mild comic relief from the tension; the cheesy voice acting returns, albeit better delivered, but still clearly far from remotely believable. This is by no means a criticism and I personally think it's a charming quirk of the series.  The gameplay is certainly the main draw of the remake both for nostalgia junkies and newcomers alike, as its design is now considered vintage and very rarely recreated successfully by modern games, if at all.  Each beat, each possible decision has been carefully considered, making for a highly curated, and deliberately paced experience, designed to keep you on edge. Although potency of this effect will vary on how seasoned your are with survival horror games or horror in general. In may not be the scariest game, if at all by today's standards, but it will occasionally make for some unpleasant encounters.  The gameplay is near evenly balanced between combat, resource management, solving relatively simple puzzles and planning the safest and most efficient routes around the Spencer estate.  Saving is restricted, much to either rage or delight (chances are you'll feel both), and have to be used sparingly or you may corner yourself into having to traverse a great deal of hardship (and restarts) before the next ink ribbon location. Say what you will about rationing saves, but I like the challenge it presents.  The combat is at the very least been made easier by the updated tank controls, along for quicker movement, as well as the inclusion of daggers and flash grenades that are basically free passes when being grabbed by a zombie or hunter. However, overconfidence and bad positioning can still get you easily killed, so you can't relax too much.  A great deal of the puzzles haven been changed or modified, as well the inclusion of additional puzzles to keep things fresh, so old solutions may not necessarily translate to this version. Each puzzle is distinct and novel on the first play through and breaks up the pace nicely between combat and travelling.  So, in conclusion, despite being clearly a product of it's time, this game is certainly worth your investment. Even if you're not partial to survival horror games, it will at least give you an interesting insight into the peak of survival horror design.",

I would buy any of the old Resident Evil games that are remastered (hopefully they remaster the second and third one too). Firstly, I read some other reviews and they were all slating the optimisation of this game, for me there is no problems. I have an i7 4790K with an ASUS GTX 970 and this game runs flawlessly at 60FPS as that is the cap that I have set. It went into fullscreen first time on the options menu and all of the settings were automatically configured to high as well as FXAA antialiasing.  Gameplay wise the game is brilliant. The player models and interactive objects look great in HD graphics and you can either choose the traditional Chris/Jill or the newly created Chris/Jill. Whilst having the newly updated player models the background still rendered image keeps the authentic, survival horror theme to the game, of which it created.  Without being biased I can strongly say that any avid Resident Evil fan will love this remaster whatever the look/gameplay is like. I am one of those people. I also like how this game will hopefully create new fans of the series as the time that this new HD remaster has come out, a whole new generation of gamers will get to experience it which should be considered a gift and should be respected.  Overall, I think this remaster is brilliant and is worth the money for any fan of the series and even new players who are interested.",

It was even more frustrating to know, capcom will depend its future RE designs based on the Sales of REmake.  ... and we all know how that went: bad sales numbers on the gamecube = RE 4, 5, 6 and many other trash.  At that point i made myself a promise: Should the REmake ever come out for PC, i'll buy it for full price INSTANTLY. No waiting for test reviews, no waiting for dropped prices. Capcom shall know, what kind of Resident Evil i wanna' see what i do not.  13 years later, they finaly come to their senses and i can keep my promise. Here's hoping now, that many other purchased the game too and show capcom, we want Resident Evil as a horror game, not a CoD Clone with zombies.  ... Oh, and the game itself looks good and plays smoothly after a few minutes getting into it. It's everything, i had hoped for.",

So 4:3 for me is just a screen encased in black bars, even though it should fill my screen.   Also, good god these graphics make the game more terrifying than ever.

It takes the tone so much more seriously than RE1 on the PS1 ever did.   The backtracking, amazingly doesn't feel cheap. The backtracking isn't just put there the fill time, but to add atmosphere. It'll force you to backtrack through a door that will break if you go through it, or through a place with a zombie and a crimson head.   Unlike RE1, it isn't known for moments like 'Wow, what a mansion!', and more for moments like the bit where you have to walk through a hallway, and there's a zombie standing outside, tapping on the glass slowly, but it never gets in. There's no insta-kills (Wink, wink!), there's no stupid basement music, there's only you, a few bullets, a mansion, and some zombies. I love it. So go buy this game. It's only £16.

But back to the game, I love the camera angles mixed with puzzles and zombies which gives it a good mixture, they have the balance just right, you can only carry so many things and need to store the rest in the storage box which will have you saying this is a pain but in fairness I believe it adds to the game, the younger players won't like it as they have been fed a diet of no brain+no skill games like the COD series but if you appreciate a game with a purpose and not the run about for a few hours because you will complete it anyway because we really need you to buy some crap like packs or a season pass so we don't want it to hard for your poor we brain and hands then I would say buy it.",

Actually you should look at the performance of this game on ps3 and xbox360, and you will say 'Wow its f***king great!' By the way if you can stand Ubi's games I think there's no problem any more.  Few guys say there may be not synchronized between audio and video, but most of us never faced such problems. In my opinion the reason why you might face this trouble should because of your hardware, or drivers. To solve these problems, I suggest you can set the frame to 30fps, and, turn off the f**king vertical synchronous. Remember, if you have two or more video cards, this game probably only use one of them, especially integrated graphics, you'd better choose the better one or find some patch to fix it.",

It's not a bad touch up - and it's the best looking version you're going to find anywhere - but make no mistake, it's a touch up. The only true additions are the new control scheme and the enhanced lighting. Other than that, you can see the rigid low poly models like Jills hat and shoulder guards, Barry's solid metal vest, Barry's HORRIBLE looking magnum for one thing...it's just silly. Obviously they weren't going to go back and re-remake it again, but come on. I've worked with the original GC models, ripped from the game, and these don't look very much better.  Other than that...boob physics, and achievements. Same great retcon-full story that all of these Steam 'reviewers' are accrediting the success of Resident Evil and survival horror in general to, ignoring the fact that when REmake came out, the survival horror genre was actually finished, and has been dead ever since with very few exceptions. If you don't believe me, well, then that doesn't affect you because you didn't actuall play RE since day 1 to know the original story.  Buy it but do it for 14.99 and not 20.

The static backgrounds in my opinion look blurry and overstretched on high resolutions, you are still having to wait 6 seconds in between each room when I thought that the door loadings would have been removed or at least sped up. Going back to the old tank control system is a real trauma, and the new control system is just awkward, with your character constantly snapping to different directions in between screens, without any transition or turning animations to mask it or make it look natural.  The PC version doesn't have a good variety of settings for you to customise the graphics and, aside for a new costume for Chris and Jill, so far, I can tell you that absolutely nothing has been added.  I am a few hours in and I am wishing I never picked this up as I regarded the GameCube game as one of the most beutiful and immersive game experiences of my childhood.

I had previously played RE Nemesis and Code Veronica on the Dreamcast. I have played RE4/5 for 100s of hours and completed them numerous times (my RE4 hours on Steam are only a fraction of my total hours, I played the 'original' PC version previously), also RE Revelations is excellent, and I've also played RE6 a bit although I am not too impressed with that one.   I was excited about getting this game. It runs flawlessly for me on i7 4790K and gtx 750 Ti. Although it IS very demanding indeed despite its modest graphics. I've tried it on my laptop (AMD dual core 3.2GHz with Radeon 7520G graphics) which is capable of running the modern RE games decently, and it is too slow to be playable, even on the minimum settings and resolution!   I have played this game for a few hours now and I cannot get into it at all. I am not enjoying the experience. There is a complete lack of direction for the player to know what to do. You can wander around all of the unlocked rooms, examine every object, and find yourself stuck and having to go on google to find out what to do next, only to find loads of other people have done the same thing. I never got stuck in the modern RE games. I found them challenging, and I might have died or needed to replay sections to get through them, but I always knew what to do and how to do it. The player should never be left dangling and directionless.   The game mechanics and camera angles are extremely dated and if this game had just come out as a new game in 2015, rather than being a 'classic', I wonder if it would have the same high ratings. Judged purely on its own merits, it's medicore. It isn't fun. The enjoyment of a game should come from playing, you should get enjoyment all the way through, not only when you complete it.

But for people who have already played this game and played the Gamecube Remakes, you are going to be unhappy with what you get. It's pretty much the same thing. The game suffers from all of the same problems it had in the past and is really more of a emulated version of the game then anything else.   I don't know WHY I thought this was going to be a remake instead of a remastery, but the reality is, the first Resident Evil game suffered from some pretty big problems, like lack of a real aiming system, the controls and the wonky camera angles that refused to actually allow you to see your enviroment.

The frequent non-linear process for solving puzzles, ect. These again are part of the original nature of the game, and has nothing to do with flaws in the HD remaster. I suppose I should say that I'm very glad that games in general, and specifically the Resident Evil series, have (over the years) become less tedious in the way they are developed and played. Again, I do recommend this game, but please be aware that it is a game from 1996.",

Every time the camera angle changes you loose the direction you are walking in and wind up running around in circles like an idiot. While that can be worked around for the most part, puzzles that require you to push a button and run around a moving wall with 4 camera angle changes trying to shove a statue into a notch.... well, I'm done. If they had updated the inventory and control system it would have been a nice blast from the past but as it is it's just a pain in my ♥♥♥.  ***Update: I switched to the alternate controls (duh...) and WOW what a difference. It still has the stupid inventory/save system and screw the pooch camera angles... but the controls make a world of difference. I can actually recommend this now.",

            "review_text": "- Graphics :  A 13 years old game with a nice upscale to 1080p &amp; constant 60FPS. No drops. Ever. So yeah, it has aged, you can't deny that, but it's still very pleasant to the eye.  - Sound &amp; Musics :  Voice acting is bad, let's not even try to hide that fact. Seems to be a trademark of the RE franchise though. Musics are nice, the same as the 2002 Gamecube classic. I had a few mini crashes in the sound department (the music suddenly stopped and got back on track 2 sec later), but nothing to lose sleep over.  - Gameplay :  The exact same thing as the original Gamecube classic : weird camera angle, weird control, inventory being restricted. Not a fan of it to be honest but I can get around it. If you're new to this style it might take some time for you to get along with it but you'll see, it's quite nice when you get the hang of it. As for the old fans, well... isn't this the game you prefer from the franchise ?  - Storytelling :  HAHAAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH.  HAAAAAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAH.  ...  Oh, wait, you're seriously asking ?!   HAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHA !!! HAAAHAHAHAHHA  ...  But seriously, no. The story's not very clever, it never got very clever in the RE franchise.   - Length :   Takes about 10H to beat one of the two 'stories', both are quite similar (Chris really is the Hard mode of the game so if you want an easier time, you should try Jill first). Then if you want to end with both characters on max difficulty well... that will just make things longer for you. So your call, really.  CONCLUSION :  It's a remaster of the cult classic Gamecube 2002 title, you already know it's good. It's a very nice port, if you just got into the Resident Evil franchise, be aware that this is very different from what the newer games have become since the 4th episode. I still recommend this as a good experience &amp; a good starting point into the Survival Horror genre.... and if you're a fan of Resident Evil, well... let's be honest : you already purchased this one, and will pre order RE Zero HD Remaster the day it's available on Steam.",

            "review_text": "This will contain some spoilers!  I'm not an old fan of the game, i've only seen bits of it way back in 1996, when i was in the german military and one of the other guys had a PS1. I recall the real live action intro, and some other things like a couple puzzles, but thats it.   The game: This game has a very strong atmosphere. I jumped in my seat at least twice, and was frozen when i played in darkness and someone turned on the light in the corridor of the house i live in without an audible sound. I was relived when it turned out to be a neighbor, haha. You really need to think about what you do next. Do i kill this Zombie? My ammo is limited, and if i do it, he might come back as a tougher Crimson Head. I could burn him to avoid that, but fuel is scarce. Maybe i just leave him be? But he could break through the door and haunt me again! While other games just beg you to kill kill kill, this one makes you stop and consider. There are plenty of ouzzles, but nothing overly complicated. There is usually some hint nearby. Also the limited inventory forces you to consider every move you make. Even the often despised save system adds to the tense atmosphere.  Sound: The sounds are very clever. There is no music most of the time, but rather reinforcing moments of music, like when a Zombie appears, or something could jump at you suddenly. Once you reached a saving and storage room, there is relaxing but somber music. But the thing i love the most is how realistic all the sounds are. Whether you walk on stone, dirt, wood, carpet on wood, carpet on marble, weapon sounds etc etc etc, everything sounds realistic. Very often you don't see the enemy, but there is a sound....is it s zombie? The voice actors are good, and they fit the mood. Especially Weskers coldness comes through well.   Graphics: The graphics are beautiful. certainly, much of the stuff is still from 2002, and looks kinda low resolution like, but that even adds to the unreal haunted house atmosphere, and just improves immersion. I think a version ith high res textures and such would even ruin some of the atmosphere. You feel like you are in an old B-movie. And just like those movies, the derelic look just adds to the desolate, lonely feel of desperation. I also appreciate very much the fixed camera angles, which often feel like something is watching your character...something terrible under the table, behind the fence, or on the ceiling. The character models however are very detailed. Maybe not state of the art like, but they look very realistic. For example on Jill you can see the elbow, knees, shoulder blades, biceps, collar bones etc. They are not buff stick figures but rather fit and beliveable people. The animations are very different between Chris and Jill. Jill for example has a slight swing in her hips whether she walks, clims ladders or runs, while Chris is stiff as a board. Even when they are attacked by the same insect in a certain room, they move different. Jill is flailng her arms uncontrolled, while Chris tries to wave away the little bugger.   Characters. There are a lot more cutscenes than i expected. With Chris you work mostly with Rebecca Chambers, and with Jill its Barry Burton. But the supporting characters don't just do the same stuff, no, its very different. That makes playthroughs with both characters very rewarding. Their personalities are also distinctivly different. Chris is clearly the big brother to his little sister Rebecca, doing encouraging thumb ups or pat her shoulders, which she appreciates. Jill and Barry are more like equal partners, with Barry being the more experianced one. Fortunatly none of that feminist stuff is there. They are not tough as nail ♥♥♥♥♥es, a trope beaten to death in modern media, but rather believeable. When Jill first sees a Zombie she panicks and Barry busts in to help her ever now and then, but she is also very capable, breaking door locks, or shouting at Wesker. She is not afraid to wrangle with a Zombie either. Jill is a great female character, weak and inexperianced first but becomes stronger over time. Working through her fears, instead to act like she had none. Clearly the makers of the game weren't infected by political correctness.   Detailing: There are tons of details in this game. When the characerts move through the derelict parts of the house, they stir up some dust, whether you run or walk through water puddles there are different sized splashes, the detailed character models, the different sounds, particle effects like weapon fire or dust, Zombies bodies dissappear once a bigger opponent shows up in the Spencer mansion, and so on and on and on. My favorite part of the game is probably the small path to Lisa's shack. The dark wood, the mist, the mansion in the background, its just so dark and beautiful!   Verdict: I never played any version until this HD version, and therefore i can't say whats from the 96, 02, or 15 version, but i always had the feeling it was done by people who love this game and want to make the best version possible, whatever version it was. There is none of the cynism that modern games often have. Can't win against the big boss? Buy this great DLC!   If you have patience, like immersion and atmosphere, and don't care for blazing guns all the time, buy it. Its the first of the original style with fixed backgrounds Resident Evil games i played, and i just can't stop! For people who love to unlock stuff there is some of that as well. Different costumes, weapons, modes and ending movies.  I didn't encouter any bugs, freezes, or crashes, it worked just fine.   Its obvious to me how great the design of this game is, and that this is a classic that even after almost 20 years still is able to sell a million+ copies with just a slight graphics update! Can anyone remember the Call of Duty game two numbers before the current one? Can you tell apart any Assasins Creed game? Whats the difference between the latest FIFA game and the one from 2011? This game has heart and soul, and a brain, too.   Buy it.",

It looks beautiful and you can see details that you never knew were there but the lag is horrible. Usually, if I can keep a game above 20FPS, I have no problems. But even at an almost constant 25 FPS, everything is slo-moish in this game. It's playable for sure, but I didn't preorder this game and wait so impatiently to play it just to have a 'playable' experience. I wanted it to be amazing.

You must read doccuments you find in game with clues on how to solve the puzzle, somewhere accross the mansion. The puzzles are remminisant of old point and click adventures, you will spend much time in one area trying to advance. This game takes all of those things to the next level, with modern day graphics to back it up, and draw you back in.  Combat is tense, you will not easily dispatch even the lowest zombie with a headshot, rather carefull planning and dodging enimies is critical to your success. Deciding if you should avoid certain areas, a similar feeling to realy being there yourself. It is very possible to play yourself into a corner, and not have propper supplies to survive if you play foolishly. This is what makes the game so ourstanding, in comparrison to modern day horror games. There are real consequenses to saving too often, healing too often, shooting too often, poor planning such as forgetting an Item you need ect. The game is scary, there are some jump scares not found in the original, zombies can reanimate stronger if not dealt with propperly and become impossible to kill with the pistol, There are new jump scares, new bosses, new areas, new dialog.   I have only a few minor complaints. First, the tank controls are an absolute nessisity, including the new style at defalut was a bad way to start people who dont know any better. A changing camera with the new controls is disorienting and the player can change direction too fast that way often sending you back the way you came into a zombies arms. Second, I wish they could have retouched a few of the grainier looking scenes. Only a few areas dont look so remastered. The last complaint is the leaderboard hackers. Tens of players are listed to have completed the game in 0 seconnds, and those are the first players listed when you view leaderboards. Not a huge deal.   The game is worth more money that they charge for it which is perplexing coming from Capcom but well appreciated by me. BUY THIS GAME.

Feels like Capcom polished the Mansion but that's about it. And it's a visable polishing too. Mansion looks beautiful: outside? no so much. Especially late game) Weapons feel good. Probably the best feeling guns all series. Plus you have the added bonus of headshots with EVERYTHING.  Achivements! Although this is also a con.  Cons: Game has some serious sound issues at the start. Voices out of sync and what not, like every other review says. Some shadows are out of place, some reflections are changed and stuff: things that WEREN'T pressent in the GC release.  Achivements. Some are god damned stupid. Like the 'clear the game with just the knife'. Now I like to think of myself as a somewhat decent Resi player (not to brag but I've clocked RE3 on hard more times in one day than you've taken a dump in a week). But this 'clear the game with just the knife!' Is stupid. I mean, Jill's armour is made of styrofoam and her knife is a bannana. I mean serriously, I died about 5 times trying to kill a single zombie with her. Not worth my time. Now I won't be 100% clearing this game like RE4. Which is a shame, because it'll anoy me.  No really bad Barry puns! No Jill sandhwich's or masters of unlocking! What's going on?? (it's a joke...) The music sometimes doesn't play at all. Or sound effects. I was running this on a GeForce 660 card fine at 60 FPS. Now I'm on a 980 and this game has the same slow-motion as many other people are saying. So maybe wait till a patch until getting this if you have a powerhouse like me.  Current status: 6/10. It's a good game, don't get me wrong. I love it. But the con's do drag it down a fair bit. But if you can look past it, then it's certainly worth playing (And certainly worth $20)",

            "review_text": "When I loaded the game for the first time I couldn’t even start the game, but with some help from the forum. I was able to get it game working, and have added the problem I was having at bottom of the screen.   The graphics of the game are amazing, it’s so crisp and sharp in every part of the game. In the mansion the back ground makes it very beautiful and old. Sort of like century old vampire house or an opera house, which is what resident evil typically shows in there games. The courtyard forest is so creepy, it makes me feel like I’m in a typical scary movie, and making feel if I turned the next corner something would jump out at me. The game typical follows the story line, or for anyone that has read the series, it also follows the RE “The Umbrella Conspiracy” book with some slight variations in it. I also love the fact I can play Jill! I sometimes get so tired of playing a guy, and it was nice of Capcom to give the game the option. On the other hand I got a little tired of her girly response during some scenes, but I figure that was part of the first game response from her character back then. It was also nice of Capcom to give an option of changing Jill uniforms. At least for me, she looks awful and bug eyes in her first uniform. She looks much better in her BSAA (Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance) uniform.   When you load the game, I was a little disappointed in the zombie scene in the morgue. It’s extremely blurry, and almost seems it is out of focus. At first I thought it was my computer up until I loaded it, and saw how beautiful the inside of the mansion was. I’m still not sure why Capcom didn’t clean this scene up. There’s a scene from the perspective of the zombie, and it is blurry and out of focus too. But this is what I expected when you’re a zombie, and besides you wouldn’t expect to see very well through rotten eye balls anyway. The split scenes from Jill and Barry are excellent, but the helicopter ride at first is terrible. The worst is the newspaper clipping at first, I can’t even read those. I also have noticed that when you get hit by these zombies, and including fast Zombies, you stumble back into the zombies. Not bumping into them, but being absorbed into them for a short time. I also noticed a zombie with its head through the wall, and I know I’m good shooter but I’m not that good. When you’re running away from a zombie, and you’re near a door you have to be just at the right angle or right position in order to open the door. I’ve got caught (died) many times because I wasn’t precisely at a good position to open the door. Also and I cannot stress this enough, save ONLY WHEN NECESSARY. All end all I think 20 for this game was perfect, any more than that and I wouldn’t recommend. I give it a good solid over all B and this is because of the graphics for the background, cost, and the options that came with it. Probably C- or D as for as the bugs go and the out of focus scenes.   I've reloaded the game again, verified the cache files. I've looked on my taskmaster and it doesn't say its running. When I click on the icon “resident evil biohazard' steam gives me a black box says preparing to launch and I get nothing. I look on my taskmaster when I click on the icon, and it does bring it up but then it goes away.   I went into the direct file, and clicked on the resident evil bhd.exe file application file, and it tells me 'the program can't start because XINPUT1_3.dll is missing from your computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this problem', but I have already verified the cache files and it says it’s all good but I can’t even start the game. I looked in my direct left 4 dead one and two files to see if it had those exact files missing and it does have it. I looked in steam files, and it does have XINPUT1_3 in them.

            "review_text": "I hadn't the opportunity to play the Gamecube version but was a massive fan of the original. I would say that yes this is a great remake to get feeling of nostalgia as well as something new. I don't think you should bother if you had already played it on Gamecube.  What's new is a whole lot of extra rooms in the mansion, its like everywhere they hit an external wall they made it a big bigger with an extra door leading to another hallway or an outside terrace etc. This stuff was all very nice. The puzzles in the mansion are different enough from the original that I was quite satisfied. Ultimately the new areas provide a new experience getting through the mansion. Also noteworthy is that the courtyard is hugely expanded. The Guardhouse and Lab have roughly the same amount of stuff to do as the original. All in all I found just enough extra puzzle work to tickle my brain and I thought I was stuck a couple of times, tempted to check the internet... but glad I didn't.  The mechanic of burning zombies was really awesome, though playing the game as Chris that fuel flask taking an extra slot, and only able to burn 2 zombies before needing to refuel, was slightly annoying. But only I think because in the past I would have had that extra slot for health or items. Honestly its a good extra challenge, and I came to the conclusion that I would burn some of the zombies in well frequented areas and the others, well just hope for the best. And I found out the hard way what happens if you use all your ammo killing every zombie in the mansion without bothering to burn any. Good gosh I had to restart the game I got myself in such a health/ammo pickle.  Actually the first run through the mansion is the main challenge of the game, and beyond that it is frankly really easy for the most part. I played as Chris on the hardest skill level btw. The Sharks and Plant42 were the only enemies I found threatening once I got out the mansion for the first time (wow the sharks, such an impressive scene compared to the original equivalent). I'm sorry to say, the snake boss was really easy on both occasions. I used to get swallowed by that thing in the original but now he seems just easy to dodge. The spiders and hunters seem to have trouble hitting you too. I never died to them once, whereas in the original I couldn't count the number of times a hunter had swiped my head off my shoulders. You get all these blue herbs and I'm not even sure why, you might get poisoned twice by spiders and that will be it for the whole game. And the end game tyrants are slow and easy to dodge. I don't like spoiling it but I think people ought to know, the second half of the game you could pretty much play without using an ink ribbon. I had about 50 shotgun shells left too. I collected every first aid can in the game but didn't use one of them. I used most of my herbs but probably 10 mixes left over.  But that first run through the mnsion, holy hell I thought that this was setting the stage for a really really tough adventure. I died so many times to the zombies and the super zombies that I nearly gave up. I ended up killing all the 'slow' zombies with the knife just so I wouldn't run out of ammo. Might not have been neccessary, you could dodge most of them, but this was just my playstyle I guess. By the time I was finished with the Guardhouse though, just felt like going along for a cinematic ride after that. Some mental challenges remained but no creature challenges. I actually felt guilty dispatching or ignoring the hunters so easily.  There is a lot said by others about the mixed bag that is the 'hd' backdrops. Personally I found that this did not bother me, The lower quality backdrops were in there, but if I hadn't read about it I might not have noticed. The character models look good and in general the game feels nicely polished in terms of storylines, cut scenes and just enough differentiation from the original to keep it interesting.",
