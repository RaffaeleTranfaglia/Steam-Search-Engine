Mission accomplished :) I can't see any space sim jockey not loving this, especially for the $$$. Oh, and the best part is you can actually do stuff without getting ganked (Eve) by a high level sadistic ♥♥♥♥.   Edit: FYI the developer is mad cool and wants to improve this already great little space sim. So whats already a competent, fun game I feel will be even better in the future. So yeah it's got my full recommendation.",

            "review_text": "For 10 bucks I took a chance on this little space sim. It's not the sexy feature rich game on the scale of EVE, and the comparisons to EVE can't be avoided, because it plays a lot like it. But its damn fun for what it is.  You create your name, pick an avatar portrait, configure very modular difficulty/galaxy properties, press play. The galaxy is randomly generated. There is a short simple surprisingly useful tutorial that is skippable, and you're on your way. You mine asteroids, kill pirates, run missions, upgrade your ship and components along way. You're a prisoner in a section of space essentially slaving to make money for the Corporate Government that put you there. It's a lawless zone with rules.  They way you move from one sector to the next farming, killing, looting, questing each sector with harder pirates to kill, cheif among them being an officer pirate, or even a pirate base. It feels also like a dungeon crawl in some ways. Which inevitably makes it feel repetative, but that's where all games end up eventually.  But, more features are coming, and I expect this labor of love will see continued development. I think the Dev understands what makes games like this fun. I've already got more than my $10 worth at 22 hours, and I'm nowhere near bored with it. The only problem I see in its future is that unlike EVE with the MMO player presence, a single player game requires believable AI, and meaningful interaction with it, as well as a very well paced and balanced progression. He doesn't have everything quite fleshed out yet, like the leveling and skill point system seems a bit clumsy. A lot of missions early on aren't worth the time, unless you up the mission rewards in the diff settings, but that makes the good missions way too rewarding. Fuel system needs more thought IMHO. Just little things that don't break the game at all, they just need some balance here, some polish there....  Bottom line. I hope people buy this game. I'm glad I did.",

Then upon completion of those you were challenged to complete the next ninety sectors. The game has some really nice graphics for being a simple game. I wasn't to impressed with the looks of the ships in this game. I thought they could have done a better job at designing better looking ships and actually see the weapons and engines ecspecially when you did upgrades, This game was fun to play, but could have been a fantastic game if they would have added some more detail in the ships and perhaps threw in a few alien races that you had to either errdicate or form an alliance with to spicen it up. Overall tough it was a nice game to play. I enjoyed the star systems, the music they chose for the game was nice, but there was so much more room for improvement. I hope they come out with an Astrox2 that gives the gamer more detailed ship's. star systems and a little more interaction with other species. I think it could be a top seller if they would only enhance what they have started.",

            "review_text": "It's a small game. It's a simple game. And, if you're into what it's selling - which I am! - it's quite fun and relaxing.  The only space sim I've ever played is Elite: Dangerous (so, not an EVE player here!), in which I tended to do a lot of mining, trading, and pirate hunting. Astrox has all three of these activities - including jobs ('quests' in a sense) - albeit on a far less high tech level. Regardless, I've found it intensely enjoyable to go through the somewhat repetative gameplay, which is changed up by increasingly more difficult pirate battles, and the 'Oooo shiny!' moments of upgrading the ships, or landing a character level up.  This wonderful little Diamond in the Rough may not have the crazy, amazing visuals of big title games - such as the aforementioned Elite: Dangerous - but I still found it just as amusing to play!  I'm the kind of person that takes something for what it is, and Astrox is what it is: A Space Excavation game put together by one individual with a lot of passion.  I am loving this game and I'm looking forward to playing more, which I'm about to do right now.  Props to the Dev. I can't wait to see where Astrox is going!  Best $10 I've spent this year (and, of course, I'm the one who bought the game hours before it went on sale!!! LOL). So if you're reading this while a sale is on, grab the game. If you're reading this while a sale Isn't on? GRAB THE GAME ANYWAY!!!! :)",

The developer was chatting with the community daily and seeing his improvements and successes as this fantastic game grew from a buggy nothing to the realized dream of not only Masula's vision, but the combined vision of a very engauged audience was a real treat.   Not only is Astrox almost infinitely replayable, it's one of those games that makes you want to come back and play it again a year later. Of all the games I bought on this summer sale, this was by far the best money I spent all summer long.   My 8 year old has one request, Jace -- can you please make an Astrox living wallpaper for Zedge.  This has all the classic ingredients for a game that will survive for decades. 10/10",

            "review_text": "Astrox: Hostile Space Excavation is a sifi sandbox simulation game, that simulates the life of a space miner/trucker.  there really isn't any plot to speak of outside of you being sent to some far flung corner of space, armed with a small ship and given a simple instruction 'mine meteors and avoid pirates'.  The gameplay is relatively simple, you equip your space ship with various modules, such as storage space, weapons, mining lazers, defences, etc. Then you go out into space and mine meteors, gathering up materials before either refining them, breaking them down, turning them into things or selling them raw. You can only carry so much before your cargo bay is full, at which point you need to fly back, possibly refuel your ship and go back out again. You can also go hunt pirates, which is a good idea if you want to clear out a sector of space, preventing pirates from ever returning to the area. Different materials are worth different amounts at different stations, allowing you to game the economy and maximise profit.  Now, the main issue with this game is the fact that it begins to get really repetitive, very quickly. In the early game, you mine space rocks and kill pirates occasionally, in the late game, your doing the exact same thing, there is no point to doing much else because its just not worth it. You can have the biggest, most well equipped ship in the game, but thats not really going to change much. It also feels terrible to try and control the ship, especially when just setting it to auto and allowing it to do its thing is so much easier. The game never really progresses much and just feels like the beginnings of a sifi spaceship based game, but it doesn't do anything to really feel engaging or challanging outside of fuel management and keeping track of the best prices in the system.  Visually, it looks rather out of date and doesn't have any truly unique or stand out features, the music was also rather uninteresting, to the point where i just had the radio on as i played. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, not because its bad, but because it isn't good. There are many more Games like this with more interesting features, which i would say are better.",

            "review_text": "This game seems to be small, but it has lot of great content. Especially the deep upgrade and item system and the hard fight against higher leveled enemies make this game quite interesting. Fighting seems to be boring at the beginning, but can become absolutely deadly in mid- and later game, unless the player configured the game to easy or with too few systems. When the reznors and bigger enemies come, things become much more interesting.  The controls with lot of automation options make fighting and ship management easy. Flying feels quite good and lot of easy useable camera options offer lot of possibilities. Weapon fire and hit in the center of ships and objects. Collisions are not happening. This gives a high performance boost and is actually not a big problem. Graphics are pretty decent and have a own unique style and the music gives a good atmosphere.  The game is not the best, but it is quite good and has a long history of continously developement and growth. The developer cares about the player and does lot of work. I have played this game since the beginning on another platform in the beginning of 2014. I have played it for aprox. 100 hours before i bought it on steam. I played lot of games of this genre and can say, this is a quite unique experience, which is actually worth the few bucks.   Things, which can be improved or added: -active startable Missions with triggered events (examples: fly out and kill group of things; fly stuff to XY and don't die; fly stuff to XY without getting any hit; collect 10 boxes; shoot and destroy blue asteroid before it hits station) -More cool speeches from pirate leaders -Big boss fights (hard strong pirate ships with long range or high speed or other special attributes... rare pirate, epic pirate, unique pirate)",
