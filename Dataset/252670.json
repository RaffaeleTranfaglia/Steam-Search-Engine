            "review_text": "“Ew, a mobile game getting a PC port? No thanks!” You might say. But wait! Not all portable titles are games with simple yet addictive mechanics looking to take your money. Nihilumbra is a neat little puzzle platformer from Spanish developer Beautifun Games. You take control of Born, a creature created by The Void, who escapes to the real world. Relentlessly pursued by that which created him, Born treks across new and strange environments, discovering what it truly means to be alive.  He isn’t the only being from The Void that has crossed over however. Every now and then you will encounter a new enemy, each more dangerous than the last. These, combined with various environmental hazards provide much of the challenge outside of the platforming. The jumping itself isn’t complex, but as the game progresses you will discover new colours which can be painted on the walls, ceilings and ground of the levels. The game has five separate worlds, and there is a colour tied to each of them. The Frozen Hills grants you blue, a colour to make surfaces icy, helping you run faster or push previously unmovable objects. The Living Forest gives you green, allowing you to make surfaces bouncy. The Ash Desert provides brown, which makes anything you paint it on sticky. The Volcano grants you red, which heats up surfaces to burn objects and enemies alike. Finally, The City unlocks yellow, which conducts electricity, allowing you to link electrical objects together. Thankfully the controls translate to keyboard and mouse perfectly. Painting is as simple as left clicking and dragging, and doing the same with right click acts as an eraser. Although the game is 2D, the first two colours in particular have a very Portal 2-esque feel about them. You will be using momentum to jump and bounce your way to new platforms, and although it sometimes lacks precision, it isn’t all that frustrating. You will often use multiple colours in the same puzzle. For example you might use yellow to activate a powerful electromagnet, lifting your enemies into the air. Using brown on the floor in front of you allows you to walk along underneath them without being attracted yourself. There are a good amount of well thought out puzzles here. None of them take particularly long to figure out though. The game as a whole is not all that hard, and can be completed in a few hours at most – an unfortunate leftover from the fast paced mobile platform it was born on. Nihilumbra employs a simple, yet effective art style. Each level has its own colourful theme, often attempting to give you a feel of the heat of the area. The icy areas are very blue, and the volcano is red, for obvious reasons, but this also related to the story. As Born uncovers new colours he begins to feel warmer inside, as if The Void inside him is being filled. The main character himself begins as an amorphous blob, but upon entering the real world he decides to change himself to try and blend in. The first thing he encounters is a scarecrow however, so you spend the rest of the game naively jumping around as a cute, raggedy old shadow creature. The character design of the Void enemies is good too, with weird plant creatures which launch projectiles at you, and a huge snail-like thing that erases any colours it slithers over.  At the end of each world, there is a fast paced platforming section where you are being chased by The Void. Ever encroaching from the left of the screen, you simply have to stay ahead of it and reach the end. These are some of the weakest sections of the game, as it shows off the lack of accuracy the platforming has at times. Switching between colours quickly is cumbersome, especially when attempted at speed. I would have liked the action to pause when bringing up the colour menu, as I often got caught out without the colour I needed. Thankfully the game is liberally checkpointed, even in the normal levels, so you never lose much progress. These checkpoints also seem to return all of your colour to you. It feels as if you are using some sort of resource when painting, but this was never explained, and I never ran out, so I can’t be sure. All in all, Nihilumbra is a short, but fun, puzzle platformer. The puzzles you encounter aren’t all that difficult, but they do require some thought, particular in later stages. The platforming itself isn’t all that good, but the unique painting mechanics make up for it. Mobile games are becoming more complex, and simply better overall, and it is nice to see that some of the higher quality ones are making the switch over to PC.",

            "review_text": "Nihilumbra is a poetic 2D platform game. In my opinion, it's very similar to Limbo, but the game also made me think about Another World and Heart Of Darkness for the design, the level-design and the gameplay. The poetic side of the game is reinforced by the off-voice of the narrator in almost every screen of the story mode. The story mode is not very difficult, and its main purpose is to tell a poetic story, the birth of the protagonist from the void, and his discovery of our world through different and various landscapes. The gameplay is based on the mastering of colours, which have different properties, such as the possibility to slide, or to bounce, etc...  Once you've finished the story mode, you unlock the void mode. Here, forget about the story, the poetism and the narration, it's all about thinking, skill and timing. The void mode visits all levels of the story mode once again and modifies them into much harder puzzle levels. It's somehow like the dark world in Super Meat Boy, but in a more easier way though.  I had a good time with this game, and I recommend it to every Limbo-like lovers.  Nihilumbra has just one big problem : its length. It'll take you about 3 hours (maximum) to finish the story mode, and maybe the double to beat the void mode, depending on your skills.",

Your main goal in this action game is to survive and avoid your natural enemy,which is also your philosophical father, 'The Void' or Death,call it how you want. The game will reveal its best aspect when played in New Game+,known also as 'Void Mode'. This game has a nice longevity ( 13-14 hours ) and it will surely pleasure your eyes. The gameplay is solid; your charachter will gain new and new abilities troughout the entire game.  Note that this game deals with philosophical issues like death,nihilism and hope.

            "review_text": "Nihilumbra has a defined art style, strives for narrative, and deals whimsically with depression. But its narrative does come off as a touch preachy and its narrator is not entirely interesting. There’s also the problem of game play. Nihilumbra is a puzzle platformer with few solid puzzles and irritating platforming that consists of predetermined stages of play. These areas shift as you move along instead of the screen following your character. It’s off-putting at first then it becomes truly annoying as you die to enemies situated directly out of your view or you have to take leaps of faith. The game doesn’t advertise itself with the game play though, but ultimately what it does claim to have falls short. There is great potential here, but it falls short.   Nihilumbra has a good name, interesting art, and a nice soundtrack… That’s about it really. If you like those things go for it. If not, I can’t recommend it.  ",

        {
            "review_text": "Nihilumbra is both a very interesting and very divided game. It was presented to me as 'Limbo meets Portal,' but in practice, I found it to be like neither of these things. The unfitting dark creatures roaming about the relatively normal environments felt more like Heart of Darkness, and the emphasis on the 'paint mechanic' (there are no portals) gives it more similarities to Tag: The Power of Paint. I was also told that the game made figurative waves on the iOS market, but that is a market so inundated with inane and uninteresting nonsense that the comment meant exactly nothing to me, so I went about my playthrough of Nihilumbra determined not to give it a free pass for standing out from mediocrity. So let's get to it.  I said that I felt that the game was divided. The gameplay is divided into two distinct modes, the story mode, and the void mode. The latter is unlocked after completing the former. The story mode is what you'd expect; it tells the story. The biggest problem people will have with the story mode is the narrator, or more specifically, the narration design. The decision to have a narrator in a game about nihilism is questionable. I'd think silent, empty text would serve the presentation much better, so that's what I went with when I played it. I don't think the voice is necessarily terrible, but I don't think the presence of a voice in this game is necessarily warranted, either. The narration is also triggered by your position on the different screens within the levels, and if you die and return to a checkpoint, the narration will repeat every time, and this can get grating. Fortunately, for the people who will be too lazy to mute the narration, the story mode is almost too easy.  Void mode is the game's answer to that. It's the obligatory, 'you can't spell 'indie' without 'die'' departure from the almost insultingly easy story mode. This section of the game is of a very much 'Oddworldian' difficulty. There is plenty of trial and error to go with the more challenging puzzles. You will die in void mode. I've seen void mode criticized a lot, but again, these are (mostly) iPad gamers we're talking about. Fortunately, you are given a reprieve from the narration, but this can be both good and bad. You are introduced to void mode with the promise of closure to the game's somewhat bitter epilogue (What? Did you expect a good ending in a game about nihilism? DID YOU?). While you do technically get that closure, it's accompanied with absolutely no narration or text, so it's a bit of a dull reward for anyone who played through void mode because they liked the story and wanted that elusive happy ending. The only other thing you get (besides the achievements and accompanying bragging rights) is a 'secret language,' which changes the text of the narration and makes it the complete antithesis of taking itself seriously, so if you thought the story was pretentious garbage, hated it and want some cheap catharsis, you might enjoy replaying story mode for that, but it will just end up leaving a bad taste in everyone else's mouths, especially with the internet memes which have basically already made the 'humor' rather dated.  There is appeal to be had in both the story mode and the void mode, but I think the whole package kind of antagonizes itself. I don't see many people enjoying the whole of the game. Most people will probably heavily prefer one half over the other, and people who prefer the story mode will have to settle with the bitter ending, and people who prefer void mode will have to trudge through the story mode. Whether you decide this game is worth it to you or not will depend on which of those two types of people you decide you are, and whether you feel that you'll only enjoy one half of the game.",

The best thing has to be how this game makes you think - and I don't mean with puzzles, though it will certainly do that.

Like the fact that you can't use your mouse roller to choose diffrent colors so in the middle of trying to stop a red color from killing you, you must go to the corner and click the purple and in trying to do that the red color burns you to death. Then you have to go to the last check point which in most cases is very far away from where you were. What makes that more frustrateing is that the check point that would have saved you was two feet away.   But then there are some really annoying things about it like the fact that if you die and there is a point where the narrator talk he will repeat it and if you die a lot he will repeat it AGAIN AND AGAIN. Is the narrator suppost to be my conscious? He would always say stuff like 'You should feel bad' 'You feel guilt' it was kinda like gauntlet where the wizard says PLAYER 2 IS HUNGRY. Except the wizard only said that when it was necessary not every 2 seconds.   It was like the narrator was trying to make me feel bad for this little black thing that had no personality or backstory.And he kept trying to remind you that HEY DONT FORGET TO FEEL AWFUL. Sometimes he would blatenly say something along the lines of you should just kill yourself because you were 'ruining' the places you were leaving behind.   The puzzles are not challangeing and the monsters in the game make inovative and new ways to solve them impossible and they are so repetitive that you die 3000 times before you can get to the next checkpoint. Sometimes there is a part of the void that is plastared onto the scenery so it is impossible to try new ways to solve the puzzles. The scenery is bland and the game itself is very repetitive. There is no real story at all to it except to run away from the void. No reason to why I want to do this no reason to why I am in the places I am. It was cute at first but then it just got annoying and was no longer fun to play and had absolutly no replay value.

It did not satisfy me... The game control is in my opinion not very well thought out... and well if you played the first part of the game there is no need for this, true! But come on... in the second part of the game it gets so much harder... it could be made better... Also I think the hitradio is sometimes redicules...The graphics and the narrator are very well! But somehow nothing new and so spectacular that made the game 'ok'...  I really credit the gamedevelopers for making it! But it bothers me for who... a child who should learn perspectif about life? (well not with this strong words and complex gameplay...) a teenager? (well yeah could be! but I don't think they will be interessted for long...) an adult? (listening yes! but the gameplay makes it very fast boring...)  Please remember, this is only my opinion.

            "review_text": "Simply put, I really did not like this game. Many of my complaints are mirrored by other reviewers. The narrator's voice is not very well acted, very repetitious, very trite, and just...constant. He shows up with zingers about finding your heart, how anger is dangerous, how it's important to feel sadness, and at times I found myself blinking in disbelief that the lines made it through to the final draft.   The gameplay is mediocre. It isn't outright bad, but it's just not very fun. You spend most of your time trying out different powers, which will give you the ability to: slide yourself and objects over ground, toast things (including you if you're not careful) with raging fires, make the ground 'bouncy' so everything springs off of it, create electricity to turn on circuits (and thus make puzzles 'run' their active elements), and a few others I'm probably forgetting. That's the thing - the abilities are really just forgettable. Platforming staples like 'bouncy bouncy' need a little twist to make them interesting. Otherwise you are just back to Mario and spring-boards again.   Personally, I found the story tedious and unoriginal. You play as a sliver of the void, inexplicably cast onto the earth, and running from the 'void' - an understandably featureless foe who chases you across the map on occasion, and summons minions to try and slay you in a few different ways. The rule in this game is Insta-Death, which would be fun and exciting if the monsters were not so often acting in entirely novel ways, reacting unpredictably to tiny mistakes on your behalf (e.g. missing a small spot on the floor with the 'paint-on' effects), or just being RIGHT THERE as you enter a new frame. They also tend to have (IMO) awkward hit-boxes, such that you think you are okay springing over them, only to mysteriously die when you get too close.  I finished the main game in a little over two hours. It's a decently priced game, and I don't have much to complain about here. There is a 'void' mode unlocked after beating the main game, but I found the game suddenly veered from stupidly easy, to stupidly hard when I reached this mode - I never found the game reached that 'sweet spot' for me, between the two poles. I found myself, ridiculously, stuck on the very first 'room' of Void mode, perfectly able to solve the 'puzzle' (jumping over a charging enemy by building a little altitude), and occasionally succeeding (only to die on the next room) but almost entirely unable to execute it.   Trading Cards are a nice perk, and I sold them for an effective $1 reduction in price.  Achievements are what you would expect. About half are for clearing levels and winning the game, or objectives you can't avoid completing. The other are fairly obscure, and I believe there is a handful of hidden ones. Nothing too staggering here, but par for the course.  Overall, I disliked this game, and would probably rate it something like 4/10. It wasn't pull-out-your-hair bad, but on reflection, I think it was not worth the money. A couple hours wasted, no harm done, but nothing I can give a 'thumb up' to with a good conscience.",

There's nothing overly wrong with the game, but I didn't feel overly compelled to continue when playing through it. It wasn't quite challenging enough for me (not necessarily a problem), but perhaps it was a bit too slow for its difficulty. This wasn't a game that I was sad when I completed it since I couldn't play it any more. I was content at the end, but that's about it. Note that I did not play new game+ since I personally had enough.

From what little I experienced, it seems like Void Mode is the meat of the game, expected to take a lot longer than the first part.

There is narration, feels, thoughts etc. When you finish this mode the game unlocks the 'void mode', which is a more difficult mode which tests your understanding of the mechanics. Progressing in the void mode unlocks more stuff in the art gallery, which actually is a nice reward. The art is a strong side of this game. I'm glad you can even see designer scetches when you unlock that.  Thoughts: I wasn't very comfortable with the controls (and the mechanics). Initial momentum is very important, you don't get much control mid-air. Levels are divided into screens. I get a feeling that this decision was brought up very late, as beating some screens requires speeding up from an area on another screen. I wish this game used the classic side-scrolling model. The narrator began to annoy me a little after some time (he sounded a little monotonic). Also after respawning at a checkpoint a few times the narrator reads the same lines every time, which is also getting annoying after a few times. Art is an important aspect of games like this. Progressing unlocks more entries in the art gallery, which in my opinion is a good reward (there are also achievements, which add replayability value). While the story mode is beatable in short time, I'm sure the void mode will take a lot more time to beat as it is more puzzle-and-mechanics based.  So, should you get it? It's an interesting position. Made me a little emotional actually. The art and music fit well together. The narrator says some things that actually make you think about life and death a little. If you're looking for something like that - go for it. If you're looking for a challenging platformer then I'd recommend something else. This game takes away some control from the player.",

This game has story, that is a pleasure to hear the narration of as you flee from the very stuff you are born of. You now seek to LIVE fully and embrace the world in all its colors. You must keep one step ahead of that which you now must avoid at all cost, and gird yourself in the energies of life to move ever more effectively and even defeat those things which dare to bar your path.

The game lacks a dificulty curve and goes from mind numbingly easy to dreadfully dificult with no real middleground. Many deaths seem to require forsight to bypass on a first try or be up to luck. Thankfully, in the main game this is mitigated by frequent checkpoints and while not so great design wise is quickly forgotten. In Void mode however, the game feels like platformer romhack design in that there is a lot of waiting, needless spikes for precision platforming in long puzzle areas, and the oppening has you face to face with an enemy and flat terrain and is just an awful introduction to the mode that left me feeling 'Really game?'.   While I do have negative complaints, let them not be the entirety of my view on the game aside from aesthetics. I enjoyed the combination of platform and painting puzzle elements and I would like to see more done in this vein without resorting to the void mode levels of dificulty! There are amazing ideas at work here and I think they are more in need of fine tuning and dificulty balancing than being anywhere near outright bad. I hope to see more from these devs in the future, and hope they improve along the way!",

            "review_text": "This is a beautiful game with a stirring atmosphere and mood. A puzzle-platformer at it's core, it is immersive enough to make you forget that you're solving puzzles or dodging strange other-wordly creatures but feels more like a story that you're enjoying and experiencing.  I don't play many puzzle games and I still loved it so don't overlook this game because of the puzzle factor! I found the puzzles to be just right - they were sufficiently rewarding and never too frustrating to solve. The platforming is pretty straight forward and enhanced by some of the unique abilities the protagonist acquires (eg: being able to shoot a sticky-mud thing onto walls to cling onto or shooting bouncy grass or ice to reach sections otherwise inaccessible. There's some nice creativity at the core of this game.  Once you complete the main story (arguably not quite a 'story' in the traditional sense but still immensely enjoyable...) you unlock a harder version of the game - same areas with more complex puzzles. These, I safely avoided due to my aforetold indifference to hardcore puzzle games but that does add good replay value and may strike a chord with the puzzler in you.  In all - this is an excellent Indie title. You can even try the demo from the developer's website I believe if you're on the fence.  PS: IIRC I spent more than the 3.5 hours reported by Steam on this game (probably spent offline) but in any case this is a short game without any doubt, so bear that in mind.",

I have no idea how long this second campaign is though, as I currently can't get past the first level without looking up a walkthough. At the time of this review, the game is on sale for $2, and at that price I would call it a must-play.",

The levels are short but sweet with frequent checkpoints - even if you have trouble adjusting to the controls you never get sent back too far. The music is wonderful and does an excellent job at setting the mood of each area. Although I've never been a fan of auto-scrolling, especially while being chased by an invincible hazard, I found myself looking forward to the void segments the most. They're easy enough that I didn't find them frustrating at all.  One problem I had is that at times I found myself overthinking the puzzles and making them harder for myself than they really are. The solutions are always fairly simple, and the frequent checkpoints mean that even if you have trouble and die several times you're able to try again almost immediately. That being said, this game is suitable for any skill level and isn't hard to learn to play. Highly recommended.",

I think the story and narration is really great, the puzzles are good for the most part, and I loved the style and mechanics of it all. The only complaint I would have is Void Mode. After you beat the game, you unlock Void Mode, which is basically hard mode. In Void Mode, the puzzles range from fairly easy to nearly impossible, either because it's difficult to figure it out, or you know exactly what to do, except you have to execute nearly perfectly. Not to mention that at the end, the game basically says, 'Hey you should go do Void Mode' and I was hoping for like a cutscene or something, but nope. Although it does reward you for beating it, I was kind of disappointed. Although, I would still recommend the game at least for the main story, and if you're looking for a challenge, Void Mode is for you",

This is an amazing indie game that obviosly had a lot of love put into it and deserves more attention.

It has a basic story, which I was indifferent to, but other reviewers seem to like it. For me, the story neither helped nor hindered the game. The narration can be turned off.  Highly recommended.",
