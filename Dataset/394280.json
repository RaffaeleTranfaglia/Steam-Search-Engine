            "review_text": "Story: Occulist and gnossis Gordon Child sends his most promising, once student a harried message concerning the Order of the Rose and the Philosopher's Stone. He wants her to come to his city office so he can explain the details. When she arrives, his office is in shambles and he has disappeared. She travels (or is summoned) to the island where she discovers an immense tradegy; the inhabitants are dead and the fortunate ones have fled/escaped from the destructive and homicidal evil new master of the island who is searching for the Philosopher's Stone to gain its power. While searching for her mentor, Gordon Child, our heroine, meets and helps various lost souls bound there, who in turn call her their 'savior' and the 'chosen one'. (And just to be perfectly clear, this game does NOT smack of any religious connotations, beyond good vs. evil.)  About reviews: I decided to add this bit about reviews here after reading other reviews AFTER I played the game and wrote my own review. 1) Most reviews complain about the graphics claiming they are old. Fine they are not exquisite pieces of art but they are highly detailed and crisp, and in many ways fitting with this supernatural and quite possibly 'not in this world' island. The artwork is consistent and stylized. 2) The cutscenes are a lot of the game, and live actors play a role in both the cutscenes and as the lost souls in the game. One thing all the reviews seem to have missed is the heroine is 'reading their mind/ emotions' with the medallion and the people are dead meaning they basically lack the outward emotion of the living. So the live actors do not need to speak or even be lip synched properly. I personally found the disconnect, disconcerting and baffling, and intentionally or not in my opinion it added to the surrealism and other worldly flavor (like a reminder almost) the heroine was from a different world (quite possibly literally).   Gameplay: On expert mode there are no sparkles (which in this case look like runic symbols which move sideways) and that alone makes finding the hidden object scenes, puzzles, and needed inventory items tough. The cursor does change from an arrow to a round glass circle with a tail, but if the gamer lacks the patience to thoroughly 'explore' each scene do not play on expert mode the first time. This game requires some intuitive and a bit deductive reasoning to play. For instance, when confronted with a half finished ladder, it is obvious the ladder needs planks for steps, nails, and a hammer. What is not so clear is where to obtain all those items, a shed, a tool box, floating in water, against the building, laying on the ground. This too is part of the challenge of the game, knowing what one needs, finding it somewhere on the island, and then obtaining the item once it is found. Fortunately there is a fast travel map though it is not really needed.  The game more or less plays in a linear fashion, completing the scenerio of freeing a trapped soul before being able to move on to the next one. There are four souls in all that need 'saving'. So with the introduction, and conclusion that makes six separate but interrelated 'chapters'. Plus there is a bonus chapter.  The hidden object scenes are fair, nothing outrageously hidden, but one is required to look closely for some of the finds. (One reveiwer vehemently complained about the finds stating the find clue could be several things. This is true. For instance, handle could an axe handle, a shovel handle, or a machine handle. However with a bit of deductive reasoning ... say there is a shovel blade in your inventory most likely the shovel handle is what the find clue is referring to, if not click on all the handles until the correct one is found. Simple enough.) There are fragmented or 'hidden' objects to locate which are colored in the clue list. I do like when a clue find is found it turns red-black then dissovles into smoke. I think it adds to whole evil/supernatural motif and different from the usual disappearing find clues. Each hidden object scene plays twice (some possibly more) so remember where they are (especially on expert mode). Some are played once early in the game then again much later in the game. The same is true with some of needed inventory items, one finds the item early but may not need it or be able to get it until late in the game.   There is a variety of puzzles in this games: sliders, matching, logic, codes, rotating (the bonus chapter one is very difficult). For the puzzles I highly recommend reading the diary. In this game, the diary is the most helpful clue giver found in the game, and often is where the clue needed is found. The dairy also relates the scenerio objective to the storyline, sometimes adding information to the pages after the initial reading.  There is one extra find in this game: the scrolls. I doubt they are missable since they are obtained during game play and the entire storyline is crytically given through the visual cutscenes when the scroll is read. Two special achievements I would like to note here are 1) watching the cutscenes and 2) examine all the notes, maps, scraps of paper. Both are easily obtainable if one does not skip the cutscenes and actually clicks on the notes, maps, scraps of paper to read them. I actually recommend clicking on the notes, maps, and scraps of paper because they often end up in the dairy, and once on the dairy pages often gain extra information.  Overall the game is a fair challenge on expert mode and relatively hard on casual mode depending on the gamer's experience level.",

            "review_text": "Really need a meh option. So it's basically a perfectly servicable point n click/hidden object game and if you like that kind of thing it's reasonable to assume you may get some fun out of it.  However...  The use of live action actors for cut scenes and mixed into the game really doesn't work, it just looks jarringly out of place.  The protagonist suffers from having to find dozens of basically identical tools to do things which renders some 'puzzles' annoying since you have six different items which could be used to do something but not the specific one the game has decided you need, especially since there is very little consistancy in how they are used.  Likewise in the hidden object segments it will occasionally ask you for something so generic that you can spot three or four versions of that item in front of you and you have to click them all until you find the one the game wanted you to collect.  The click boxes for somethings were off, especially noted on a puzzle involving rotating rings where the areas required to click to move each ring appeared to be mapped to an entirely different set of rings from the one I could see.  Oh and the map that (on regular difficulty) will point you in the direction of a location that has something that you can do in case you get lost/stuck doesn't actually have all the locations on it so isn't nearly as useful as usual.  There are much better games out there, but if you already have them all and tyou spot this massively discounted...",

            "review_text": "Firsty I want to note that I experienced a game breaking bug and had to restart, around 40-60 minutes into the game. I didn't know what to do next and hints weren't helping. Thankfully (or not) other people on steam forums had had this problem and I knew what to watch out for when I restarted.  The way the story of Dark Heritage is presented is not enthralling nor exciting. I feel like they had good concepts (using real people in the cutscenes so they could convey emotion on a low budget, the society of the people on the island) but the execution...isn't there. I'm having trouble recalling what the island's backstory was because the game just wasn't very memorable. The game is about talking to lost souls so you can find elemental rocks with which to unlock a mythical magic stone! It should feel more mystic, especially because Artifex Mundi has a good reputation for conveying atmosphere. But this game wasn't developed by them.  The puzzles were often annoying. the two most memorable types were one where you press a button, or lever or what have you, and it affects other levers in the same row and you have to get them all into position, and one where you rotate rings of a circle so they align. While I'm not fond of the first type, I did them all on luck and didn't have a problem with them. The circle puzzles were worse. Often, I was feeling like the way for them to align was just a bit out of reach, thinking I was missing something. I think I used hints to get through one of them after minutes of frustrated sliding, and the solution was to slide them in a bit out of sync but enough that they aligned to the outer rim of the circle. All this did was make me feel like a fool for trying to find a perfect alignment. Another one of these puzzles (one in the bonus adventure) I skipped because the pattern was too same-looking and after many hopeful attempts I wasn't getting a solution.  Hidden object locations didn't take into account if you'd already found objects there, so while the list of things to find was new, the things you'd found previously were put back. This is a minor nitpick but it's important. Part or the satisfaction of playing a HOG is the feeling of 'cleaning up' a scene; there is then more satisfaction when one goes back and has to 'clean up' a scene further with a new list of things they probably remember seeing on their first time. If you go back to a scene and all those things are put back however, it's like what you did previously didn't matter, completing games doesn't matter, nothing in your life matters because you're making no impact on world. I'm exagerrating a bit, but you see my point, yes?  Also, the lipsync was off on both the only speaking human (an actor) and the bird (animated).  I don't hate this game though.",
