            "review_text": "God how I hate this game. Mere words are not sufficient for me to describe my bitter hatred of this game. I wish I were artistically inclined so that I could funnel my rage in a violent abstract painting or in a Shakespearean tragedy so that it can be used as a warning for future generations against still life 2.  I liked the first game, but I regret wasting time on the sequel. Just to put this in perspective, I played this game two years ago and I still get angry when I think about it. Shouldn't I have gotten over this by now? Clearly I have been psychologically damaged by playing Still Life 2. Hopefully this review will help me find the closure I so desperately need.  The dangerous part is that the first 3/4 of the game is not bad, but the last bit is horrible and makes no sense. The ending pushed me over the edge from irritated to enraged. Go play still life 1 instead, and avoid the PTSD this game instills.  I would recommend buying this game and gifting it to all your enemies though.",

            "review_text": "SL1 was decent so how come the sequal was this bad? The biggest flaw of SL2 is the developers forcing unnecessary realism into point-and-click, again. Like in Syberia having to watch the unskippable stairwalking animations... The graphics are worse compared to previous game but you'll get used to it and then it looks quite nice. The voice acting is horrible, Paloma Hernandez in particular. The story presentation is sometimes confuzing. Here are the cons:  1. Time limit in some puzzles: solve this riddle in a few minutes or die, and try again. Pray that you've got all the needed clues before the clock starts ticking. And I tell you: it will get worse later in the game because suddenly there's a♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of these time limited scenarios. And because characters move smoothly like a reversing logtruck so you waste most of your precious time trying to get where you want.  2. RPG-styled inventory micromanagement. The mother of gamebreakers in history of point-and-click. You have limited amount of slots in inventory, therefore you sometimes have to drop some items into containers and get them later. And how fun is the backtracing with Microids snail-paced, clunky-moving unresponding controls. Oh by the way those containers are not 'linked', so if you leave an item in a container you won't find it in any other container. For the sake of realism of course.  3. Character relative camera. It follows every, I mean EVERY move of the character. So when she's idling the camera wobbles side to side along her idling animation. I remember some the other game from Microids/GameCo which had this same feature and it was infuriating.  4. At least on my computer the game sometimes ran ok but sometimes crashed for no reason every 5 min when investigating objects. Remember to save often.  5. You die constantly in the end game if you don't know what to do fast enough. But thinking of the characters in particular, who the heck cares?  At least I played this piece of art through and in conclusion: SL2 managed to violate every reason there is for me to play point and click.",

            "review_text": "I had played Still life 1 back when it was on xbox and wasn't really that much of a fan because of the terrible control scheme that felt too similar to a Point and click adventure, but since I never played 2 which was also released on the xbox some time back I decided to give this title a chance only because of the serial killer from the first game being a complete badass. The first thing I noticed when I started up was a really bad droning electronic soundtrack, but still I persevered on. It wasn't until I jumped into the game I was treated with the same utterly dead control scheme again, but yet still again I pushed on, trying to find some good in it. As soon as the first voice actor opened their mouth I was becoming aware that the nagging accent was a very poor Mainer accent(Like A cross between Mayor Quimby and Angela Lansbury bad.) So lets get this out of the way, the game is strictly puzzle solving in the form of a point and click style game and while I can't fault it on that because I knew what I was getting into having played the first game. I can however fault it for making a murder mystery extremely uninteresting, but slighly compelling to finish the mystery that Carried forth from the previous title Still Life 1. So if you got what it takes to survive the nightmare(in More ways than one) then pick it up. It might just appeal to you, but if you can't hoof it through a Point and click adventure with a slightly interesting storyline,save your money. I give it a pass only because of the generation it was launched in, and because it will appear to some of the other players and shtting on it doesn't make a review helpful for anyone.",

(which i like) i wish there was a 'still life 1.5' because the cut scenes from the past could have been the plot for a game aswell... :3",

Got very close to the end of the game after a few hours of surprisingly tedious 'collect every single microscopic scrap of evidence before you can progress' gameplay only to hit a puzzle I couldn't solve due to not being able to click on a piece of paper. I could see it, I could practically read the clue, but because I couldn't click on it I couldn't progress. Uninstalled it and went to youtube to watch the ending.",

In Still Life 2 just turn the voice acting off and you might have an overall better experience. Or suffer through dull uninterested passionless voice acting of someone else entirely different. It's like Victoria went to the shredder of life and lost all soul.  5 minutes into Still Life 2 and you can already tell the vast differences in game detail is many steps back from the original Still Life 1  The camera angles in this game also rotate/flip on its own when you reach a certain threshold in a scene compared to the first which if you click on edges of the screen in the first one the mouse will be highlighted indicating a scene change, here not so much it's just plain frustrating at some angles",

I had a wonderful experience playing this game. It was fun, engaging, interesting. To be honest, i loved it.   I rate a game by how much I think about the story after and the playing experience overall, and this delivered. Minor annoyances like the inventory system didn't detract for me at all.   I would completely recommend this game for adventure fans who loved the first one, just go in with an open mind because like I said it's not perfect!!",
