If you are a command and conquer fan I reccomend kanes wrath to you.",

            "review_text": "Command &amp; Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is the expansion pack of Command &amp; Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars that you need the main game first to play this game.  The game has a 13 missions Nod campaign that brings you to the three timelines, or 'acts' 1st act: After the events of Firestorm Crisis (C&amp;C Tiberian Sun Firestorm) that tells you how Nod has risen again.  2nd act: In the events of Third Tiberium War (C&amp;C3: Tiberium Wars). 3rd act: After the events of Third Tiberium War. This game will tells you more clearly about 3rd Tiberium War as I said above. You will play as LEGION, The succedor of CABAL created by Kane to give you orders.  Pros: -6 new sub-factions to play in skirmish, 2 each for main factions: Steel Talons and ZOCOM for GDI, Black Hand and Marked of Kane for Nod, Reaper-17 and Traveler-59 for Scrin. -New epic unit for use. -Story to additional explain the story in the main game. -New units for all factions.  Cons: -There are no GDI and Scrin Campaign -Shorter campaign playtime due to the fact that this game has only Nod campaign. -There is no online because of GameSpy shutdown. You need  C&amp;C Online  [cnc-online.net]  to play online (Note: This website can also use for the main game, C&amp;C Red Alert 3, C&amp;C Generals and it's expansion Zero Hour too!)   If you ask does this game worth it? I can say: It does.",

It has delivered moderately fun, offers the new fancy race SCRIN to try out and comes with each race +3 subfractions for different tactics with each different advantages and disadvantages. The graphics are more than good, sound design is very good too, but about the story i am not sure to agree with. What i especially dislike is the build-in badwords filter. Also the skirmish map's are almost all symmetric, which is not impressing me a little. This one also lacks of many skirmish options!!!  Westwood Studios have done far better work than EA LA did and will be remembered, honored and mourned for every TRUE C&amp;C Fan.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to go ahead and review both C&amp;C 3: Tiberium Wars and Kane's Wrath here, with Kane's Wrath essentially being an expanded version of the base game. If you've played the C&amp;C series before, you won't find it hard to get into the story plot being presented, included with your all time favortie Joe Kucan as Kane, forever and always. Despite Electronics Arts beating the canon pretty hard, Kane is enough to usually keep me playing for a bit.  The actual format of the game itself is pretty simple enough, sticking to the basics, you control your MCV, which acts as your headquarters and main building unit, thus losing one early game usually spells defeat. Much of the combat is rock paper scissor style, however a combination of units is usually required to mount succesful offensive and defense operations against the enemy. Unit garrison of buildings can provide for some amusing early game attrition warfare, until the game gradually reaches mid-game and late-game, in which the bigger and more ridiculous units make their approach.  Being an old classic, I would recommend this game to most general strategists, however if you're looking for an intense strategy, this might not be what you're looking for.  Kane lives!",

New units, new story to fill the gap between Tiberian Sun and Tiberium Wars, as well as showing Nods movements before and after the Third Tiberium War. Six new factions to screw around as in Skirmish and Multiplayer, each with their own units and upgrades that provide considerable upsides and downsides to the player. I'd say the price could be a little lower but it's not super overpriced. If you enjoyed C&amp;C3 you'll love Kane's Wrath. Buy it.  also 8/10",

Kane’s Wrath provides a ton of additional custom maps for skirmishes and gives the player plenty of extra content to continue enjoying C&amp;C 3.   Overall: 9/10 … AWESOME ",
