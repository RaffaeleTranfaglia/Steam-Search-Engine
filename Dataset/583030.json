    "description": "Eraser&amp;Builder is a simple puzzle game that anyone can enjoy with just a click of a mouse. Don't let the simplistic graphic fool you, as it is powered by Unity 3D to apply deliberate physics, for a precise puzzle solving. Through the Steam Workshop, players can create their own unique level, and share it along with the community.",
