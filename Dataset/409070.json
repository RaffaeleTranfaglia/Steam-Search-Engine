            "review_text": "Finish this game in easy it doesn't made this game is easy when play it on normal. The game become more hard on normal, because the enviroment became deadly. When played on easy, on the 5th level the night is bright so I can see the fall pit. But when played it on normal, the weather change becomes rain and dark. Only light from the thunder become guide. And it more deadly when choose the Hard difficulty. Anyway only play on normal or hard, player can access the last stage for true ending.  This game is a love letter to a classic 8-bit NES games. Difficulty, graphics, gameplay and music are perfectly match to 8-Bit games. Control is good, and there is no sloopy control like other games that can made frustation or rage. And this game got huge influence from Ninja Gaiden series from NES. FYI, Ninja Gaiden series is one of the hardest games series on NES era.   Well, if you trying to play the real classic and spirit of 8-bit games. This game is for you.",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Great if you can map your controller  This is like two different games. If you have a way to map the analog stick controls to your dpad it's a great Ninja Gaiden tribute with tight controls, great music, a weenie mode for people like me and two more difficulties for people with actual skill. If you don't have that it's a rage inducing game with horrible controls where at least half of your deaths will be from stick movement not registering correctly. Too bad the controls aren't mappable in the game options themselves.   I've been playing the game for a couple months. The controller issue was annoying but I was able to get past levels 1-3 despite it. Then I hit level 4 and suddenly it became ragequit city. I'd play once or twice a week, use up my lives on 4-2 or 4-4's spikes thanks to movements not registering (note that I wasn't even playing on normal or hard where the spikes one-shot you) and ragequit for a few more days. Today I set up a custom keybind profile for my controller and I immediately blasted through all of level 4 on one life. Great game if you rebind and I'd recommend it unreservedly if it had that in the options.",
