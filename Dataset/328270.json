            "review_text": "A genuine Dark Theme Visual Novel with a combination of point and click adventure. The story takes place in a world different from us.  Pros : + Wonderful Artstyle + Fantastic Story + Nice Puzzle + Atmospheric world and setting  Normal : +- English translation a bit clunky (for me it's really good as English is not my native language)  Con : - Not all episodes are out for now (still 4 of 5 eps)  For everyone who loves adventure point &amp; click or Visual Novel with Dark Theme you should try this game. Early in game (when you're a kid) feels kinda boring, but later after you grow up, things become very interesting and engaging.  Can't wait for the 5th episode.",

English version is coming late than Russian version so this annoy me a bit but I can overlook it because there are many possible responses in game that I want to find them all. It like Soul Gambler that endings depend on your choice, evil or saint, you should choose it wisely.   The story is quite interesting, I bet half of them you can't predict at all. Musics are decent and boring in sometime. Puzzles are not too hard but require a lot of reading skill. Art style is totally awesome.  Can't wait to see how this game ends.",

You can see that it took some time for the writers to get the story down, but it plays out quite nicely and your decisions as Oliver (protagonist) impact the outcome. I love the production design (characters, steampunk motif, backgrounds and soundtrack) and the tranlsation from Russian to English comes across really well with few errors. There is one elephant in this room, for me, though; there is an 'almost-sex scene' and I found this awkward as all get out. I think it could have been said without being shown, and it devalued the game a little in my opinion, which is a shame because the rest of it is awesome. ****",

            "review_text": "This was a fun, although quite short, visual novel. It's a bit dark and creepy, but I quite liked this setting. The art was mostly quite good. Especially enjoyed all the backgrounds, some characters looked sometimes a bit weird, one of them looks really good untill he smiles which just looks akward.  The mechanics are pretty much, read the story, click on stuff, go places, make some choices. I do not think the choices really matter for the story, I think this is linear, since sometimes there i only one correct choice otherwise you end of dead. There are some achievements that seem to be tight to choices but these are more meant as extra or easter eggs and have no impact. I would have liked a little more impact of the choices since giving any choice in the first place implies it will have effect which it does not. So they might as well remove it.  Sometimes you have to 'puzzle' which is just choosing correct items to use for instance, nothing difficult.   The characters are interesting, some of them they just brushed over for a second and did no come back to, which i think is a shame (or maybe a choice does affect this? I'm not sure).  Anyway, they were well fleshed out.  I would reccomend this game if you enjoy a visual novel with a good story and nice art.",

            "review_text": "This game reminded me of Tormentum - Dark Sorrow and not in a good way. I even checked to see if it was the same developers but apparently not. Tormentum and Leviathan share some art styles as well as a very preachy narrative. I can't say I really enjoyed it but I did play through it three times just trying to make sense out of everything. &gt;SPOILERS&lt; The game seems decent enough as you get started but the morality of the game consistently baffles me. You discover the your guardian murdered your mother, bought you, and molested you as a child but the game implies you simply forgive them. Your best friend confesses to a murder you comitted and then blames you for putting him in jail. However as far as I can tell you have no options at all to make different choices. Your friend just confesses and there seems nothing you can do about it. These events just happen and the game tries to make you feel responsible for them which is confusing and baffling to me. The game is extremely preachy and it feels like most of the decisions you make don't matter in the grand scheme of things. The game frequently stops in its tracks to TELL you how you're supposed to feel about certain people and events. The translation is pretty bad and the writing in general feels pretty poor. The game gets kind of soft core pervy in a few places but it seems more awkward than sexy. Lots of things are introduced but few are developed and after playing through the game twice, I got only a slight variation on the ending.  This game was quite literally baffling to me and at the end I found myself wondering what exactly I'd accomplished.",

            "review_text": "A game that had a lot of potential, but falls short in almost every way and leaves for a rather disappointing experience on reflection.   STORY:  The game starts off incredibly well and has a good opening sequence that leaves you wondering how the game will develop. Unfortunately, it all mostly goes down hill from there. The game introduces far too many interesting background elements that are left in the dust and ultimately never explored. Even its main plot lines are not satisfactory concluded and the ending in particular is a short disappointment. If you get the 'best' ending, absolutely none of the plot lines were resolved, great huh?   It feels as if the game tried to do much, and fails to intergrate the background elements it introduces with the main plot in almost any way. Despite being called 'The Last Day of the Decade', the Decade itself is just a background element with almost no relevance to the plot. And what's disappointing is that all of these were very interesting and exciting elements if they were incorporated. They just weren't.   CHARACTERS:  They're okay. Darina and Julia are fairly good characters, but everybody else is chronically underdeveloped. Oliver (the protagonist) struggles from the writers trying to tell you how you should think about certain situations. Is the point of a visual novel not supposed to be that you figure this out for yourself?   TRANSLATION:  It's playable, but it clearly wasn't proofread or edited. There are clearly lines that make absolute zero sense in English, and it feels like subtext is lost from the poor translation and it can be a struggle to figure out the relevance of some of the conversations you end up having.   GRAPHIC STYLE:  Cute, but it doesn't really get any points here. It's a visual novel though, so it's not like it's bad.  OVERALL:   4/10  A below average visual novel, and the only reason I rate it that highly is because of the potential the game had. I enjoyed the time I spent on it, but I got it for 90% off, and I would absolutely not recommend it for the price it is.",

            "review_text": "OK so literally at the beginning of the game, there's a lot of homophobia and use of the f-slur and it was very jarring tbh. I guess it was supposed to be, but that's not really the kind of thing I'm down for. I tried to muddle on through that but it was all I could think about and couldn't finish.  So, if you're senstive to homophobia, I'd WOULD NOT suggest that you play this.",

            "review_text": "A visual novel with beautiful art, a gripping story, fascinating world and unique characters.. My biggest qualm with this game is the translation and technical aspects of the writing which, as others have stated, has many errors and uses asterisk to describe a characters action or reaction ('*shyly*, *quietly*, *Oliver leaves the room*, *So-and-so looks down sadly*') vs an in depth telling which I'm sure many would have appreciated much more. If you can look past these annoyances, I find the story to be interesting and worthwhile as well as the decision making and actual game play aspects solid. There is definitely room for more than one playthrough, especially if you are an achievement hunter. I saw the mention of frustration that some choice answers are random but, as far as I have seen, they are not. If you inspect items in scenes or pay attention to the dialogue, the majority of the answers are given through history or chatter. The only 'random' answers I've encountered are riddles and they are not hard by any means. I so wish that this game could be proof read and re-edited; I think it would hold much better. It's quite long with 5 meaty enough episodes and characters you grow to care about. Enter with an opened mind and the knowledge that it is a translated visual novel and you can't complain for the sale price.",
