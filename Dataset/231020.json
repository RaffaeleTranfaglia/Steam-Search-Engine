Storm has brought me that calmness i wanted. I'm really picky about puzzle games, but this just had me interested. I love the nature setting, it looks beautiful and has good music. I'm a sucker for good music. If you've played Flower you'll probably like Storm.",

It is an excersize in frustration all the controls are very fiddly and rarely do what you want. whats more the game is way to repetitive the core concept is just too simple to support a full game. If you can get it for under a dollar then it might be worth it, but frankly don't make the same mistake I did.",
