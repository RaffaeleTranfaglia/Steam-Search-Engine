            "review_text": "Hell &amp; Damnation (H&amp;D) is an old school shooter with little in the way of a story (basically the protagonist died in a car crash and the Devil promises to reunite him with his wife if he collects literally thousands of souls), but with lots of gory killing. Every time you kill one of the hell spawn using a variety of exotic looking weapons, for example a wooden stake gun that skewers enemies to walls. The projectile can be more effective againts larger enemies if shot from a distance as it will eventually catch fire and do more damage. All of the weapons in the Painkiller franchise have a secondary fire mode and in this case the secondary fire (using the RMB) mode (accessed by using the right mouse button) see's a grenade launched, which explodes on impact if you hit an enemy directly. There are also other weapons such as the electro driver that shoots shurikens and releases lightning if you use the secondary fire, there's a rocket launcher and chaingun combo. Hell &amp; Damnation also has a new gun called the soulcatcher, which shoots blades and the secondary fire shoots a beam that catches souls, which makes it easier to retrieve them. When using the primary and secondary fire in combination you can force an enemy to fight for you. Then there's the ubiquitous default weapon, the painkiller, a saw like weapon that can chop an opponent in half, or, if used correctly mince them to shreds; it's secondary fire shoots out a blade, which when fired at a wall creates an energy beam between the weapon and the blade that slices through anything in its path. Very useful in creating a barrier between you and the oncoming wave of hell spawn if the blade and energy beam are placed correctly. If you continue to use the secondary weapon on a already dead enemy shooting at it several times will produce a gold coin (this is commonly called Monster Juggling) . Once a hell spawn is dead it will disappear and leave a soul behind, which appears as a bright mist which you have to collect quickly before it dissipates. (using the soulcatcher can greatly help in this regard). A couple of the dlc for this game also includes new weapons called The Morgenstern and The Cannon.   There's virtually no end to the waves of these spawn attacking you from start to finish as you travel through the various area's of the game; (there are 4 chapters divided into 14 stages). The story has been changed slightly from the original game, but it's still just a tweaked version of Painkiller Black.   The developers have basically cut out chapters from the original Painkiller Black and released them as dlc. The total price of these dlc is almost £40 when not on sale and the basic game costs another £17.99, plus you can buy an upgrade to the deluxe edition which includes some extra's that were never included with the original game for example tarot cards.  To be honest, no matter how much I enjoyed playing this game, I'd advise anyone strapped for cash to get the Painkiller Black edition, which is basically the same game (includes the original game plus the first expansion 'Battle out of Hell' ). The main difference between the two is Hell &amp; Damnation has better graphics, but they aren't worlds apart considering the original is 10 years old now, and definitely doesn't justify the extortionate price of the upgraded Hell &amp; Damnation. Painkiller Black may not have the soulcatcher or the two new weapons included with the dlc, but its much better value for money at only £10. In the sales you can get this game for as little as £2.50.  If you get the deluxe upgrade or buy the tarot cards separately they can add an extra layer of gameplay. They are used to unlock perks when you meet certain conditions during play which can enhance combat. The game also has a cooperative mode which is quite fun. In this mode you must collect all souls otherwise some enemy come back to life.   If you're a fan of the original series, you'll probably buy this, otherwise I advise stick with the Black Edition, it's far better value for money.    Painkiller Black gameplay video   HERE    Hell &amp; Damnation game play video   HERE    You can see that the updated version has a little more atmosphere, for example in the graveyard the mist is deeper and the graphics are sharper, the weapons look shinier etc, otherwise it looks virtually the same.   If you are a regular player you probably won't get more than around 5 hours of game play out of this title.",

It really does have a lacking storyline though, Death points you where to go, you kill. meet up with random female by chance, kill more. If you want a FPS game with a badass soundtrack, hundreds of enemies, a huge arsenal of guns(some of which would be considered a warcrime if used today) Also the game is open for users to mod and create content for it.",

You know the drill, this is pure old school, over top, wave based, circle strafing madness which is like a cross between Serious Sam and the original Doom but it makes even less sense than those games. One level you'll be blasting world war 1 soldiers and masked bikers with a rocket launcher in a train station with generic chuggachugg metal riffing in the background and the next you'll be shotgunning demonic children to death in a creepy mansion with music which sounds like something from a Tim Burton movie with no cutscene in between to explain why or how you got there. One of the enemies is an old woman pushing a wheelie bin......yeah. There are a few bad points such as it can be finished in about 5 hours, the bosses are really terrible and the voice acting is House Of The Dead level bad but while it lasts it's a blast.

They will just keep running towards you and often get stuck due to poor pathing. Multiplayer is a grave yard, so it's mostly a single player experience. ",

I seriously suggest you this game if you like games like Serious Sam, NecroVision and Rise of the Triad.  9/10  For some reasons, I can't review on Painkiller: Black Edition (Gold Edition), It's like I do not own the game but It's still In my library if you see what I mean, anyway, Black Edition deserves a 9.5/10 In my opinion.",

Imagine the original Quake and Duke Nukem games. Painkiller is essentially a combination of the two. It's an old-school shooter with no proper storyline, but a ton of evil creatures to dismember, nail to walls and blow up. Not enough for you? Jon St. John, the man behind the legendary voice of Duke Nukem had done the voice of the main hero of the game, so you get to hear him curse and talk about big guns during the cutscenes. Not only that, but the chaos and destruction of the gameplay are accompanied by amazing pure metal music. Who even needs a story or gives a ♥♥♥♥ about those rare bugs of the AI failing to find a way out (if stuck) when you get all of the above in one package? I surely don't.",

Not much to go on for story or anything else other than shooting masses of demons though.  If you liked Serious Sam, you'll probably like Painkiller. The mood is a little darker, the game is a bit shorter, and there arent as many enemies that come up asking for a bullet at the same time (granted I've never seen a game that throws as many as SS3 does Although painkiller gets close). However the weaponry is more unique and each gun has at least 2 diffrent fire modes (some have more if you are talented enough to pull it off). All of which are fun to use and add a great addition to gameplay.   In Serious Sam 3 there comes a time where you just quit using the old pistol and shotgun. That doesnt happen here. Each weapon has special talents and can serve you well all the way through the game if you choose to use it, but you'll have quite a selection to choose from.  There is not a lot of story to go around, but the voice acting and dark mood is great. Speaking of voice acting, the protagonist is voice by the same voice actor of Duke Nukem, Mr. John Saint-John. So... if you like the idea of a darkheaded Duke blowing demons to bits in the depths of hell, give this one a shot.",

            "review_text": "While looking prettier than the original and keeping that which it remade (mostly) intact, this 'HD reimagining' or whatever it may be called feels quite lacklustre.   All the weapons are there, but they just dont quite have that kick or oomph that the original managed. Youll occasionally be able to fling an axe monk across the map with a shotgun blast or turn a clown to mincemeat with the painkiller, but it almost feels scripted rather than being an innate part of the physics of the game.  In addition, the difficulty feels like it just gave up. Past the initial rushing enslaught of enemies, their actual threat has been quite drastically toned down. Bosses in particular are guilty of this, though perhaps for the better in certain cases, they feel very little of a threat - more a chore that must be rushed through or painfully waited out when forced to.  The levels themselves are also different: a number directly torn out and (only some) replaced by what only play like bad knockoffs. No more bomb and bullet infested Alcatraz and no more cramped, ghost-riddled mansion to fight through.   Is this all a testament to the original or something of incompetence from this new developer? Probably both: the best things are that which remained untouched. Bit of a shame, really. If you havent already, just get Painkiller Black Edition and stick with it. A few prettier pixels (with shoddy performance, mind you) and some unecessarily shoe-horned cutscenes should not sway you any.",

Cons: - The game is short and can be beaten in a few hours - Silly challenges that are fun, but get boring after one play through. - All the extra missions and such are DLC (I say they should've threw a bit of them in.) - Motion blur will make you want to throw up... Or maybe that's just me.... Just me? Okay. - Playing solo isn't fun. Get a friend. - Ammo. You need more.  In my opinion, the game is fun, it really is, but there isn't enough things to to after the story unless you're willing to have this game milk you for a bit more money. I understand they're a company trying to make a good game, but there honestly isn't enough to say appart from 'It's okay.' I'm not saying the DLC is bad, but they should've put some of it with the game.... Or atleast add more to the campaign like the levels from the original Painkiller, hell, I'd even say add Painkiller: Overdose maps if it meant the game would be longer.   So, what would I give it if I had to choose?  6.5/10  So, should you buy it?... I honestly think that's up to you, if you plan to get the game and DLC, go ahead, more power to you, but if you just want the game alone, I'll also say go for it.... But you might want to get it on sale so it doesn't seem like a complete rip-off.",

I like it for what it is, but it frankly doesn't aspire to much.  That said -- controls are INSANE: mouse wheel changes weapons when you DON'T want to change them, and DOESN'T change them when you do. The whole experience, even when set to Daydream level, is frenetic to say the least.   I call this a fun Halloweenish diversion for a couple of bucks, but not something that I would like to play for long hours or over the long term. Deleted it for now, will re-download and play again for a few hours on Halloween next year. DLC? Cheap as it is, I wouldn't bother.

            "review_text": "After playing this game twice, I had a lot of different impressions of the game. I've played the collectors edition with artbook, soundtracks and some ingame power ups.   Painkiller is a FPS were the protagonist is always mooving in maps and has to clear them from enemies. After each area or room the game saves automaticly. To the gameplay: First of all there is no auto heal. You have to collect souls and armours to survive. Between the rooms you can look for secrets to get power ups or extra munition. The last big diference between this game and other FPS is, that there is no possibillity to scope. All this things sound quite harsh in the beginning, especially the missing of auto heal, but the game get's never unfair and there are a ot of armours and lives placed in the levels.  An other positive aspect of the game are the good designed and powerfull weapons. There are nearly a dozen af them, they are all compleatly different and none of them is OP or useless. And they all have an epic impact. Eaven the first shotgun blows weaker enemies away, eaven in the endgame. The missing of an iron sight or scope isn't so bad, because they are 100% acurate. This point may sounds bad, but especially in the endgame the speed is so high, that it wouldn't make any sense to scope.   But there are negative points too. The game is extreamly monotonous. Mayby I wasn't motivated enough to get all the secrets and achivments, but for me the game was only doing room cleaning stage after stage. Nothing against the stages, there were nearly all good designed like cemetries, oriental castles or creepy adventure parks with roler coasters. But it was still room cleaning.  An other weak point is the enemy design. Especially after the cool level and the extraordinary weapon design I could not belive how lame most of the enemies are. They have all only melee attaks (exept one or two enemy types) and all lok like skeletons, nights or ..... clowns. There are some bigger enemies to, but you can handle them like the small ones   (bunny hop away--turn around--shoot like hell--restart this untill all enemies are down).  But the worst are the bosses with own(!) stages. They look bad, and apart from the dragon boss they are all boring to defeat. I was not even shure if they attaked me or I was just gliching around.  Last but not least the soundtrack. During the game I really liked the aggressive rock musik while shooting around. But I remarked that the sngs were repeating. A look to the special soundtrack CD made even everything worse. There were only 14 songs. ( Tony hawk for Nintendo DS has much more) and when I say they sounded all equal it isn't eaven wrong, because there are songs wich are double on this CD.(And the others still all sound identic)  So can I recomand you the game. ( Hint: There is the tag at yes upwards) I have to say YES and NO. When you like nonsense violence in arcadic shooter than yes. (I got the collector edition for 15 € with artbook and soundtrack CD)  Or when you want to try games like this one AND if it is on sale than ok, try it.  To the rest of you who don't like monotonous games or are interested in an good storry: it's mayby better not buy this game. There are other ones for aeven less mony.  Hope I could help you",

If you enjoyed those games you will most likely enjoy this remake of the original Painkiller game.  If you never played the games I mentioned just imagine a game that has a few of the most insane weapons you will ever encounter. A gun that shoots shurikens and lightning? Check. A Shotgun which can also freeze enemies? Check. Or perhaps you'll prefer the Soulcatcher? A gun that shoots saw blades, can suck out the souls of enemies and can even brainwash them to fight for you! With these weapons you'll slaughter your way through dozens of enemies that want nothing less then to brutally murder you.  The Good:  +Shooting enemies feels great.  +Gore. Enemies can be blown up into dozens of pieces. +Nice variety of weapons +DLC levels are pretty damn good and bring even more varying enemy types and weapons to the game. +Developers are active on Steam forums. They answer your questions and actively support this game.   The bad.  -Enemy A.I. is pretty bad. (they love getting stuck behind walls).  -There is a lot of DLC and if you want the full package it will cost you almost the same as a full priced game. (I think it was worth it, but I felt I should mention it). -Singleplayer without DLC is fairly short (about 7/8 hours).
