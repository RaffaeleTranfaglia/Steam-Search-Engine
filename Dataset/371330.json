If you like math puzzles like this combined with the sort of relaxing music you would expect in a game like this you will like this game. The number of puzzles you get for the price is a good value. 2 suggestions - I'd like it if you could right click for one color and left click for the other color (as of now you need to click past the first color to get to the 2nd color) and multiple profiles or save slots.",

Out of the nine displayed numbers you need to find two subsets that add to the same total.  I love math, but I didn't really enjoy this game much. There's no real depth to the puzzles and they get repetitive rather quickly. There's no proper difficulty progression either as the easy and the difficult levels are all mixed in together.  Not recommended unless you really enjoy simple puzzles.  The good: - Clever concept for a puzzle  The bad: - No real depth - Gets repetitive quickly - Poor difficulty progression - Mouse UI could use some work",
