But as a warning there is no other parts   ask the wiki stats  'The PC version was to be released as two downloadable episodes with a retail version following soon afterward, but the second episode never materialized due to Gamecock being acquired by SouthPeak Games in 2008 and the latter deciding to cancel the inherited title' it was later released on the DS as a full game, heavily scaled down. 'In order to complete the story for PC gamers, Crackpot expressed a desire to upload the cinematics for Part 2 (as well as Part 1) on their official YouTube page, '",

With its super realistic and relatable characters I dont understand why they arent charging full price for this game. At the low price of 3 dollars you get a great storyline, Interesting potaganist, hot fast action, hillarious jokes and great puns. With its compelling storyline you become compleetely emerged into the story and actually feel like you are a bug and you want to rome the streets fighting crime for great power comes great responsibility. I have to say there will never be as good as game as Insecticide except part two of course, I wonder if they will ever release it on PC.   10/10",

The characters are well designed and likeable. The voice acting is good and I love the word play. The story as far as it goes is decent but there is no getting away from the fact that this is only half the game; just as it gets into its swing the game ends. There are a couple of frustrating bits too where I wasn’t sure what I was supposed to be doing. So as long as you manage your expectations then this game provides a few hours of enjoyable entertainment.",

            "review_text": "This game perplexes me. Graphics are stylized quit nicely, but lip syncing is nonexistent. Bug puns exist literally everywhere, but most of them are forced. Enemies rarely hit you, but dodge your slow-moving bullets easily. Enemy AI is near perfect at dodging, but their pathing is awful and often leads to them running back and forth. Despite enemies practically never shooting directly at you, extra health is everywhere. Bullets deal miniscule damage but kicks instantly kill. To top it all off, the second leve, which I'm assuming is a 'Puzzle' level, asks you do to a large number of completely unprompted and largely unaided tasks. The platforming sucks too because of how badly your character controls while in the air.  I ended up paying about 30 cents and I still wasn't happy with it. At least it isn't buggy.",

Decent voice acting, the graphics are plain in today's day and age but they have their charm. Recomended especially if you grew up on spyro, jak and daxter, ratchet and clank. Also, got it on a sale for 29 cents. Great value for the money.",

Despite all the negatives I am listing below, I still don't regret getting the game while it was on sale.  The game does have some issues for me though so here we go:  1) Screen resolutions. It has oddball resolutions and none fit my screen. Best to play it on windowed mode if you're out of luck in their limited selection.  2) Setting mouse sensitivity all the way down will actually disable your mouse.  3) You need to save the changes before changing tabs in the optons menu. O.o;  4) No tutorial I think.   5) You have a double jump. I wish I knew that before the first platform leap (which you can't do without double jumping).  6) I feel that the ammo recharge is pretty slow.  7) You can just double jump from behind cover to pop the AI enemies hiding behind cover while in mid-air.
