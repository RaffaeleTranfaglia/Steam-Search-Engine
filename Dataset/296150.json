Then there are bunch of nonsensical rules which seem to be to make sports fans feel at home or something..  My suggestion: remove all distracting floating things, don't try to make it like 'quidditch in space'. Seems like original idea was about zero-g basketball so make it that: just two goals, a ball and two teams.  That's it.  Now it is just a waste of time as a game, as an experiment and as a simulation since it is entirely hypothetical in nature. If people are going to be playing games in space for excercise it should be kept simple.",
