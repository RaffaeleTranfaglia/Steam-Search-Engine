            "review_text": "I backed this game on Kickstarter as I was excited for a colony building simulator, particularly one that has some scientific accuracy. What I ended up receiving, however, was disappointing. The graphics are decent, but nothing special. As others have noted, the gameplay is simplistic: Put your astronaut to do something and wait for it to happen. There doesn't appear to be much to the research tree either. I was particularly disappointed when I ordered a new colonist and they simply appeared outside my module, standing in space suit.  I wish the game was better, I really do, but I cannot recommend it in its current state.",

Despite the idea is great and the game have potential, there is a stupid bug with the ice which make you run out of it and consequently your astronauts die of famine or dehydration after 30 minutes of game !! This bug was never fixed by the developers and according their own words they don´t have intentions to fix it at all. This make the game unplayable and very frustrating for the players. Thus save your money and DON´t BUY THIS GAME unless one day the developers change their minds and finally fix it.",
