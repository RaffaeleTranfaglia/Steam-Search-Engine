            "review_text": "I'll start by saying that this game is seriously under-rated, when you leave out the price tag. Me, I paid the full price because I was excited. I know there's a few people on here that had purchased the game and were disappointed. There's a few points I want to hit on:  1. The Price  There's two sides to this coin. It really comes down to whether or nor you'd want to spend the money on the game. If you're a fan of the franchise, then yes you should buy it (especially if you're a die hard like me). If you don't want to spend that money, then don't. Who cares about the price - it's your money, dude.   2. The Engine  This is where I get kinda irritated about some of the existing reviews. Honestly, man, it's a 2D top-down tactical game. How good can the engine actually get? Yes, Gateway to Caen was graphically better, but they're using the exact same engine as Panthers in the Fog. They added 32-bit into the engine because it allowed for better graphical animations and transluscency. It's really not that big of a deal, guys. It's Close Combat, and anybody that's been playing the series for a long time will tell you the graphics have pretty much always been the same. I re-iterate: IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL. Close Combat has always looked like this. The upgraded engine has slightly better AI and better stability, as well. As far as I'm concerned, this is not a game-breaking issue. Hell, when I play it I don't even think about that. Close Combat was never about the engine - it was about the gameplay.  3. Less Content  Let's take a look back into the majority of the series. Each game, with the exception being the re-releases like the Longest Day, have all been unique in their setting. In this case, it's the German counter-attack known as Operation Luttich. Me, I dont gripe about the content when it comes to Close Combat. Historically, those are combat elements that took place in the battle. That's the way it is, so you really don't have a position to complain about it. Personally, I wouldn't place that among the ranks for a review. Yes, it has less diverse unit selections, and yes, it has slightly fewer maps. Unless you're expecting them to cover ther entire war's range of the unit types and the majority of the Bocage, this isn't an issue.  So, that's the rant of this review. Now to core of it:  It's the classic simple interface I've come to know and love about Close Combat. It's 2D bird's eye view, and I think that's awesome. There's alot of depth they've put into this particular perspective, and all it would take is a time or two through the tutorial and you're ready to rock. Also, there is a level of depth in tactical decisions in this game that I think a good majority of the existing reviews have overlooked, from elevation all the way to effective ranges of period weapons and the fact that a mortar team has to zero in on a series of coordinates rather than the round magically landing where it needs to be. If you make a mistake in a battle, you pay for it. That's strategy, and unless you learn tactics you're going to get your ♥♥♥ kicked. 'Nuff said. The graphics and gameplay is simple enough to master pretty quickly, yet with enough depth to become a good simulation, simulating morale, cover, etc.  My conclusion is that if you're a big fan of strategic, tactical gameplay and you're a history buff about world war 2, this is definately a game you should consider.",
