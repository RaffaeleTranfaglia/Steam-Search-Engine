Yep  Pro: Fun in a thrown into a pit with a bunch of insane killers with no clue on what to do type of game Strange in a fun way Variety of options Low system specs Steam cards &amp; achieves Single &amp; multi player (beat the crap out of your buddies) Can be found in bundles  Con: A FREAKING INTO WOULD BE NICE ! Overpriced 4 other people on the planet play it Unbalanced  Overall: 5/10 (-1 price, -1 unbalanced, -1 no demo - intro - training, +1 fun, +1 weird) = 4/10  If your looking for a weird fighter and want to put a lot of time in to get to know the game, and have some budies that want to do that as well .... this is a great fun WTF is going on type of game. If your just looking to get some punches in on a buddy in a legally acceptable way this is not what your looking for.  This needs a thumbs sideways rating, but that's not an option.  Do I like it? Yes Will I play it again? Yes Will I put the time in I need to to get good at this game? No Would I tell a buddy to pay full price for this game? F No  So I guess it's thumbs down. But try it out i you can find it cheap or in a bundle.",
