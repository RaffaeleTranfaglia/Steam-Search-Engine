            "review_text": "What starts off as a intriguing mystery game soon turns a lot creepier and darker than you expect. There's also a huge amount of the game that can be interpreted in many ways, which I think really keeps the mystery going. Ultimately, it is more than about what happened to her grandfather, and a lot about Kathy struggling to put the past behind her.  The game itself, while a little shorter than some similar games (I initially found it remeniscent of games like The Longest Journey, and there's quite a similarity between the two protagonists), has a mostly strong story. There are a couple of things that could have been elaborated on, and some that seemed to go on for too long, but that's the same with any game like this. The way you do things is not completely rigid, but you don't get the same aspect of control over everything - for example, while you occasionally get the options for different responses to people, most of the time it seems to have no future effect.  The puzzles in the game are quite well thought-out, though at times they are not obvious, and you might find yourself reaching for a walkthrough once or twice. There's nothing that doesn't make sense once you've done it, but a few (such as getting the clinic receptionist away from her desk) aren't what most would think of doing.  There also seems to be a running theme of mental illness throughout the game, and it's great to see it dealt with outside of the usual serial killer/unintelligible rambler tropes. Kathy is clearly troubled by the difficulties of those around her, despite her attitude, and it's subtly played throughout the game as she turns from a feisty no-s**ts-given biker chick, to a vulnerable woman whose past is possibly leading her to the same fate as her mother.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend this game. It brings up more emotions than you'd initially expect, and while quite short, the story is fantastic and it's well worth the money.",

With thought and observation, they made sense, but were confusing until you approached them correctly.   The story was good. The highlight of the game really. Games like this are essentially a click-driven narriative so the story needs to do the job of holding the game together, which it did. It is a mystery with supernatural elements, but not creepy or scary. There are no alternative endings that I know of, so it's just a single, straightforward story.  Graphics are deliberately blocky and pixelated, I'm assuming as a kind of homage to the point-and-click adventure games of the past. On my giant monitor it strained my eyes a bit.   Voice acting was pretty good.   All in all I recommend this game for fans of point-and-click adventures.",

Quite a lengthy game for the genre - well over 10 hours (as long as you don't use a guide of course) That said the puzzles are logical and you almost always say 'of Course !' when you find the solution instead of the 'Wtf!' that was common with 1990's examples of the genre. This is a thoughtful, creepy, disturbing game - but never poe-faced or melodramatic. Highly recommended.",

Although, I did need to rely on a walkthrough at certain points, but perhaps that is just me.  I didn't expect the game to be so dark. There are themes of abortion, suicide, depression and it just quite a sad game in general.  Still, I highly recommend for those who are fans of the Blackwell series.",

My play time was 10.5 hours with 19/20 achievments. To go see a hollywood movie will run you 20 bucks minimum and only keep you entertained for 90-120 mins.

There are both dialogue puzzles and inventory puzzles to solve, and mysteries to uncover. The game isn't super difficult, with one or two 'logic' puzzles that might get you stumped for a while, but you'll figure them out eventually.  I took me a short while to get over the main character's annoying edgy 90's teen routine, but once the game starts going, you'll discover a real personality underneath. Other characters aren't extremely deep, but they do the job they are there to do.  It's somewhat reminiscent of the Blackwall series (another good adventure series, which you should at least try), both in visual style and themes, but tells its own interesting story.  I'm curious to see if Kathy Rain turns into a series, as I know I'll play a sequel if one ever comes out.",

Gameplay time is on the short side (about 5 hours), but has many fun, varied and interesting mechanics. Puzzles have that “a-ha” factor of satifaction even though they’re not that hard.",

Oh god the acting is terrible.   I describe it as 'Tumblr acting'. Its okay for a fanfic about Harry and Draco but for a real game its terrible.  I would be able to stand it, I almost could. But then you got Kathy Rain herself. She is just plain unlikeable, trying to be the hard-♥♥♥ chick with a soft heart (Jessica Jones comes to mind) however they failed miserably. Kathy Rain just comes over as a whiney b-....female dog thats constantly triggered.   If you can stand the acting, and the main character you will like this game. If not, run. Run far away.",

            "review_text": "Oh boy, here we go. I'm going to go ahead and start with the very few pros I can give this game and then I'll continue on to why I refunded this game.   Pros:     The game has good music. When I first heard that this game was good, I was pretty hyped to hear the music on the main menu. Then later on in the game, the music didn't really stop being good/fitting.     The game has nice artwork  sometimes.  The backgrounds look nice at least.     Some of the puzzles are fun and engaging.     A point and click game in 2016. (This point doesn't mean much. Just go play an older, better game.)    Now for the cons.  For the cons I won't even list it out. The main character is insufferable and she might just be one of the most poorly written characters in all of gaming history. The levels of cringe and regret I had within the first 12 minutes of this game were outrageous. I didn't even go into this game expecting much. I wanted a fun point and click adventure game and I got a game in which you play as a edgy, alcoholic feminist girly girl? What? Even her name is Kathy Rain Rain. It's like the dumbest ♥♥♥♥ I've ever seen. It doesn't end there though. So, the main character is garbage. I'm sure the others are good though, right? No. Every single character in this game gives me aids. They are ALL annoying. But no one is worse than Kathy herself.  So what about the story? The story, I did not finish. I'm not playing through your 13 dollar game if you do nothing but annoy me and bore me for 2 and a half hours. Plus, the game makes me jump through hoop after hoop in order to get from one point to another. There's a part really early on in the game in which you find an overexposed photo and Kathy says she knows a place she can go to fix the photo, but you can't go there until much later. I don't know what the writer of the story thought they were doing. It isn't a super complex story, either. I predicted, correctly pretty much every single thing that would happen as I played the game because it's just so simple which is probably a huge reason why thinking you're making a complex web of plot by putting crucial storyline items in very early areas of the game annoys the everloving ♥♥♥♥ out of me.   I know I said this next thing I'm going to talk about was a pro, but I was only talking about the backgrounds. The art in this game is ugly. All of the characters look horrible and most of the up-close areas are just simply not nice to look at. I realize it's supposed to be a throwback kind of game but you can put modern effort into the graphics and artwork of your game, believe it or not. If the game had an option to play at 1920x1080 or in borderless windowed, that would've been nice too. But nah, it's a throwback game. It has to look like dog ♥♥♥♥ because it's 1995 still, not 2016. K.  I could go on and on about how cancerous this game is, but I really don't want to dedicate any more of my time to this piece of ♥♥♥♥. Please, please, please spend your money elsewhere. The game isn't just as bad as I say it is, it's worse.",

I got stuck twice - once on the mausoleum riddle and once due to not discussing an inventory item with a character. The main character starts out being 'tough as nails' but doesn't really maintain that personality. I thought I was going to dislike her, but she was fine thru the game.  Controls are normal P&amp;C, save at your leisure, easy navigation, simple inventory access, and a journal captures phone numbers and text you may need later. You can't die - hate dying and reloading.  I got about 8 hours from the game and I generally click on everything and run through all dialogue.   I was surprised at some of the language. The game would be fairly benign and then suddenly a few curse words were thrown in. While they don't really bother me, I felt it was unnecessary particulary one choice word used in the biker bar.

            "review_text": "  Title: Kathy Rain  Review Copy Received by Developer    Kathy Rain is a pixilated 2D adventure game set in the mid-90s. Kathy Rain is the story of a budding journalist in college who has to come to terms with her troubled past as she investigates the death of her recently deceased grandfather. The journey will take Kathy to the town of Conwell Springs, where she’ll begin to dig into a local mystery surrounding her hometown, taking her on a road full of emotional rollercoasters along the way.  Kathy Rain is about as standard a click-and-point adventure game could get. You have an items menu, a motorcycle to travel around on (more on this later), a notepad where Kathy will write down those important notes to talk to those in the town with, and of course, you have the ability to combine item a with item b along with the ability to view items yourself and ask people about certain items. Truthfully, it’s fairly plain, but that’s not inherently a bad thing. You’ll play as Kathy, run around, talk to people, solve a mystery, have a crisis, it’s bordering an old, Hanna Barbara Scooby Doo plot level of ham, complete with a certain character getting kidnapped. Just don’t go looking into something unique in terms of gameplay, because that’s not the hook, and the game doesn’t pretend for it to be the hook. There is one thing that sets the gameplay apart, which is the motorcycle.  The motorcycle allows Kathy to ‘travel’ to certain points of significance in the story. Along the way, she’ll travel to places like lakeside cabins, the home of her grandmother, and a mysterious church. It’s a neat feature but really, it’s more a way to hide the fact that there’s no actual ‘overworld’ and instead, relies on the motorcycle traveling acting as a sort of hubworld for the game. It’s nice for the developers because it means you don’t have to build a huge, giant city or town to explore. It’s sad for the players because (in most cases) those overworlds are used to add personality and character to both the game itself, and the characters. Since that overworld really only exists metaphorically (I.E, the town of Conwell Springs) you lose a lot of that character and personality along the way. You also lose out on any other side-quests or adventures because the lack of an overworld. However, the gain is that the game can focus almost solely on Kathy and her story. The question is, how is the story?  To answer in the best way we can, it lacks a clear focus. We won’t spoil any huge plot points, but the game’s story is it’s central focus, and it seems rather off. The story starts off rather well, even complete with the cliché 90s things we know and love, but the focus on who’s story we’re trying to tell seems split between the dead grandfather, and the granddaughter Kathy. This wouldn’t be bad, but at the very end of the game, it’s heavily implied that Kathy was close to the grandfather, when in reality, it’s never really shown in game. As a matter of fact, towards the end, you’ll find a very important note, and she replies “ He did try to fight for me, up until the very end” and we had presumed she was talking about the father, who walked out on her and her mother when Kathy was six. But (without spoiling it) Kathy then has an epiphany, and says less than 30 minutes later that she’s over the father, and we just had this really bothered look. Turns out, it wasn’t the father who tried to fight for her [from the mother], but the grandfather, and we were just really dumbfounded. We presumed that the father was the one because Kathy mentions the mother constantly lying about people, and the fact that the father walked out combined gave us the impression it would have been the father that would have tried to fight for her.  The game constantly tries to imply that the grandfather and Kathy had this really great relationship, but there’s few times where we actually get hints of it. Like, everyone around Kathy talks about the relationship, but it’s only mentioned once of ever having one. When something happens involving these two at the end, we just felt sorely disconnected by it all. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing, and the story still isn’t awful, it’s just above average. The thing is, besides this lack of focus, everyone else is interesting. All the characters are (if a bit generic) defined and unique, and everyone has the traits to be really interesting. The only one that feels rather ‘token’ is the main character, Kathy Rain. She has some interesting things that go on around her, about her, and to her, but she herself is rather ‘meh’. She does have a defined personality, and she does have a character arc (which we can’t say about a lot of recent adventure games have) but the character arc feels really forced towards the end and without the punk, rebellious teen character traits, the game gives almost an impression of a character that could have easily been replaced. She’s not bad to play as or anything, she’s just rather ‘there’ rather than being ‘THERE’ .  There’s also the token puzzle elements filled with token. They’re there, they exist, and they’re not bad or good, rather than being simply there. Some work, some don’t. On the plus side, most of them are short, fairly obvious, avoid (for the most part) Sierra levels of stupid and ridiculous, and mostly work with the story. None of them are particularly fun to play, but they’re certainly not bad as they could be.  Visually, the game looks well, and is fairly reminiscent of the Blackwell games. While Kathy Rain doesn’t have any particularly unique style, it does look nice and places well. It uses AGS (Adventure Game Studio) and plays in a weird resolution (thanks to AGS) . It works for the game, but modifying the engine to support other resolutions would be nice. Most of the sprites for the characters are actually pretty well done. Kathy looks off, but she’s the only one. The horizon on the backgrounds are also fairly low, and thus, makes characters moving far back or forward off.  As for audio, it’s actually fairly decent. The music is well done, and the ambient effects are okay. The voice acting was something that stood out to us, mainly because it’s really well done, and there’s not a whole lot of 2D click-and-point adventure games that bother with voice acting. While the voice acting is really well done, there is a very slight pause between each character speaking, and it makes conversations sound off.  The controls are also quite standard. You click on things, and you move around with the mouse. You have some basic options for the audio, but nothing in terms of visuals or resolution.  As for the entertainment factor, we enjoyed our time with the game. It’s rather short at 5ish hours, but it may be longer if you decide to get all the achievements.  Overall, it’s a pretty standard click-and-point adventure game, with some nice voice acting and fairly fleshed out characters. The story while short and rather hit or miss at the end, still was enjoyable enough to playthrough, and the things we did have wrong with the game didn’t stop us from playing. The puzzles, meh story (towards the end) and lack of resolution options may turn off some players, but it certainly wasn’t a horrible experience. We’re not sure if we’d suggest Kathy Rain at $14.99, but we did enjoy our time with the game.    - PROS -  The music, voice acting, and overall audio is well done. The UI and controls have been simplified since the old days of click-and-points, making the game far more enjoyable to play overall side characters are fairly well developed, and have fairly distinct personalities  - MEH -  The main character (and the story) are both fairly predicable  - CONS -  Different resolution options would be nice The game's main story falls apart at the very end",

There even is a hotspot-thing if you need it (i didnt had to ^^)",

            "review_text": "Good job Kathy Rain. A welcome addition to the 8 bit point and click sub genre. Very inspired from Wadjeteye. The voice acting on this game is superb. The puzzels are sufficiently difficult but not over the top hard. A strong focus on story over action. Game plays a bit like a choose your own adventure book because it is pretty text heavy but not in a bad way. A really interesting look at how to create stories about trauma through horror and the supernatural. A bit Jessica Jones in the Netflicks style: Motorcycle, black hair dye job, leather coat, bad attitude but good heart, trauma gonna fix it, man who identifies with a colour. Not bad just interesting.  Some flaws: Could have used more action, faster pace. Lack of backstory/clear explanation as to the cause or history of the antagonist. Kathy's teenage trauma is really not fleshed out well enough. Suddenly at the end you're like, oh yeah I think I remember that. Was she even tramatized by that? Game didn't bring it across.   Curiosities: About that hair Kathy, I was a bit confused. It's 1995 but Kathy has a emo haircut with underdye job from 2005? Kathy is wearing a get up from 2015 too. Also, where did Kathy get the money for her custom chopper?   Score: 7.8. Speed it up next time and make the origin story and goals a bit clearer. Let's put some pressure on for a little more motivation. See you in episode 2 Clifftop.",

            "review_text": "Really solid throwback point and click adventure game. Kathy Rain is a really well realized character, which was a pleasant surprise. The mystery/detective plot kept me hooked throughout and there weren't any ridiculous inventory puzzles that defied logic. The plot gets a little too deep into abstract Twin Peaks territory near the end but this was a solid way to spend a few hours. I'm looking forward to what Clifftop Games does next.",
