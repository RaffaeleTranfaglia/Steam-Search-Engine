            "review_text": "Claire is a 2D psychological survival-horror game that pulls a lot of inspiration from Silent Hill, Clock Tower, and a few other horror games of the early 2000s. I had been following the title since mid-2013, and finally gave it a play after a few patches had been delivered for the game post-release (which to the developers credit, they have been very active in responding to problems the game has via patches and being active on their steam community forums and twitter). I had played about an hour of the game last February off Desura, which was very rough at the time. I wasn't quite sure what the final product was going to end up like.  Claire stars the titular character as she wakes up from a nightmare about her childhood. She is in the hospital taking care of her mother, who is sickly and bedridden. However, as she fetches coffee to keep herself awake, the hospital suddenly changes... Shifts into some form of nightmare realm. Quickly finding aid from a dog known as Anubis, they go to try and find an escape to the twisted terror they've found themselves trapped in.  In Claire, you explore labyrinth-like locations full of enemies, traps, puzzles, scares, and atmosphere as you open locked doors and trigger events that advance the story. Honestly its all rather simple. Occasionally you meet a person in the labyrinth you can help with something via a side-quest, or some choice you can make or optional puzzle you can partake in. Your actions go towards what ending you'll get at game's end, of which there are six of.  The gameplay is simple, but is supported by good design, an actually helpful map (surprising as I find maps are usually useless in 2D horror games like this), fantastic atmosphere, and a number of surreal and interesting moments throughout, backed by a good lighting engine and moody sound design.  Monsters come in a few varieties, but none can be killed, simply ran from and hid from. And they can be determined buggers in hunting you down, bashing down doors you try to escape through, and can follow you into any room outside of save rooms. You either have to outrun them, outsmart them (like blocking a door), out-climb them (they can't climb things it seems), or hide in a closet/similar hiding place. Though some monsters don't chase you at all. One common threat is a type of monster that won't chase you, but getting near it will drain your 'sanity'.  Sanity isn't for insane effects or anything, but survival in Claire. Like Clock Tower's panic feature, basically. The more loss of 'calm' and scared you become, the more you'll start taking damage, until you're panicking and taking damage for simply panicking. A big part of the game, especially later in, is managing your health and sanity and playing wisely. This is helped by the fact that like Resident Evil, the stages are large with multiple paths, allowing you to make strategic paths through the facility once you've come more familiar with its layout.  Normally I build-up to my impressions of a review by talking about the elements, but to explain Claire I need to work backwards... I loved it. It's going up there as what I would list as the best 2D horror games out there, along with the likes of Lone Survivor, Clock Tower, Yume Nikki, Last Door, Ib, Witch's House, etc. Claire succeeds in making an unnerving atmosphere that actually managed to spook me on a few occasions, interesting moments in both gameplay, design, and narrative, and wrapping it all together into an enjoyable horror game package.  And its with this severe love I have for the game I must mention that the game still has some problems. The developers are responding to them and still patching the game, but I need to make note of this as the time I played it (version 1.145) that I ran into a number of issues. I played the game kind of stupidly on Nightmare difficulty (the hardest difficulty) on my first playthrough of the game, and as a mention I would not suggest playing on this difficulty unless you really want a challenge and have some patience. But maybe because of this I experienced more problems, as most of what I had problems with was the sanity system, which was very unforgiving and has weird problems like certain cutscene spots draining my sanity so fast I would die during cutscenes and would actively have to heal myself to keep myself alive to read the dialogue in cutscenes. And then some minor things, like how I found the flashlight not really useful most of the time and just defaulted to the lighter, or a few areas later in the game feeling a bit too much like trial-and-error in parts.  I'm sure most of my problems will be addressed with future patches again, and don't think this game is worth passing up on for this.  Claire feels a bit similar to some other kinds of horror games, with the easiest comparison to make being Lone Survivor (they share a bit more in common than just being 2D games with some Silent Hill influence, though let it be known if you liked Lone Survivor, you will most likely enjoy this). However, it also manages to create its own feel and tale of horror, and the developments in both gameplay and story for the most part feel satisfying.  It's a bit slow, there are a few places where navigating and where you're supposed to go can be a bit confusing. However, the levels have a fun exploration element and will usually reward you for taking time off the beaten path, with a variety of side-quest, goodies, hidden scenes and scares, and more.  Speaking of which, the game manages to pack some good scares and 'WTF' moments through its course. I found myself a bit more comfortable and less on-edge after the first area, but the game managed to put me on edge and make me feel uneasy through the beginning first hour or two, and had its moments throughout its course. Of note, some of my favorite scares are indeed off the beaten path.  I might be a bit gushy, but that's because Claire surpassed my expectations and has stood better than most of the other recent horror game releases on Steam I have played. It's a quality horror title for lovers of old-school styled horror with a bit of something new, or those who have come to enjoy 2D horror games like Lone Survivor or Clock Tower. It's rough around the edges, but has the heart, good execution, and cleverness to pull off what it strives to be, and excel at it, despite the few flaws it has.  A bit slow, sometimes confusing, and I would not recommend going through it blind on Nightmare difficulty like I did, but a fantastic horror game that brings a lot in from the Silent Hill and Clock Tower class of horror, while also being its own thing that will be worth it for any genre enthusiast. But maybe wait to play through it once some of the bugs are ironed out.",

            "review_text": "This game is nice! The storyline is very interesting. Don't compare this game with 'Lone Survivor' because the game mechanic is totally different :) This has some similar game mechanic from Amnesia. You have a mental status and health status, you have to keep both stable. In this game you can't attack enemies...but you can hide and run away from them. What I missed in 'Lone Survivor' was the sprint button and this game has it :3 The replay value is high and there are several endings you can unlock.   The only downside is the level design...it feels like a maze sometimes with so many doors out there...I hope you don't get lost :) Use your map often and good Luck! Thx for reading :3",

            "review_text": "It's a ripoff of Silent Hill 3 as a 2D indie plataformer, but it is an intense gameplay with some scary jumps and pretty freak stuff. Not easy to play even in the 'normal' mode. Maps are quite messy, sometimes you have no idea where you are going. I should advise that this game is really for fans of survival horror genre, do not expect anything you haven't seen in horror in general, but even not beeing a game for everyone I think it is a good one and pretty well made.",

To me it actually contributed to making the game more scary but for some it might be frustrating. The map helps a lot, shows where you are, visited locations and unvisited locations too.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game about a day after the steam release. While looking similar to Lone Survivor, I didn't dismiss it as some knock off since I try to give most horror games a chance. Pretty interesting game. Good amount of story to get into while not feeling conveluted or trying too hard to be 'deep'. The main character can be somewhat relateable and immersion isn't difficult. Sound is great. Talked to their sound designer on Reddit and seemed like a cool guy (even took the time to give some tips in networking so + to the devs) it was memorable and the sounds had a fit to the atmosphere. Seeing a television on felt like a safe area and/or dream like atmosphere.   I have some things I did not like. and it may contain some small spoilers.  Not enough dog involvement. Kind of like a radio from Silent HIll in alerting the player of enemy presense.  Would like to see more. Not a fan of the map. Not too much going on in the enemy area. Most enemies are different sizes of scribbly eyes. There are the faceless creatures but ...that's about it. Still some tough spots and they get the job done. I really think there's a lot more that can be done in this game. But it does the job for a short side scrolling survival horror game. Happy with the purchase and I'd say buy it now it's on sale!",

            "review_text": "You decide to play a door opening simulator.   You walk through hallway after hallway, each looking the same as the last. You check your map after each door because the 2d Lone Survivor-esque navigation is highly unintuitive (you remember how much you liked that game despite that challenge and wish this game was more like it). Sometimes you come up against an enemy. You run through it and just keep going. You check your map again and are almost at the blue circle. You don't really know why you're going to the blue circle, but maybe this blue circle will hold some answers; or some entertainment.  There is a door that offers some sidetracking - perhaps some fun in exploration. 3 doors and 3 identical hallways later you find 'maxcel battery'. You now have 10 for the flashlight that is completely unnecessary and serves no function. You find an npc. They ask for an item. Finding this item 'saves' them. You wonder how finding a piece of candy saves a child from a lame horrorscape, but not for too long because you realize you don't care about anything happening in this vapid game.",

            "review_text": "Before I get into this review, let me just say that I really like this game. No, seriously, I do. Rather, I really really want to like it.  This is a 2D psychological horror at it's finest. At least that's the impression I got when I loaded up the game. It takes indirect inspirations from games like Lone Survivor, whilst at the same time taking direct inspiration (and even sound samples) from games like Silent Hill. The story is presented in a way that makes me really want to keep on playing. And makes me hope that I actually can keep on playing.  Which brings me to why I am not recommending this game, and I will leave it that way until I can determine if this download simply is bugged (wouldn't be the first time) or if the game just really is generally this buggy. Yes, there are a lot of nitpicks that I have with this game, such as the wonky controls, the strange way the flashlight works (it's not like it doesn't make sense, but it just feels and looks awkward), and the general map set up (It's 2D, and if you expect to know where you are, you're going to need to use this map) are problems that hamper the overall game's feel.  But these are ignorable, just because the story seems very interesting. No, the main problem with this game is the bugs. Holy cheese and crackers Batman, this game is incredibly easy to break. At least that's the way it feels. The first time I tried playing through this game, I ended up getting stuck, and wandering around the same areas over and over again trying to find what I needed to progress. Oddly enough, it was a door that wouldn't open for me. When I tried a second time, it was actually a puzzle that would not respond to anything that I did a little later into the game. Between that, various sound glitches, and other weird occurances, I just found myself not wanting to play this game.  The only reason I even decided to try again the second time was because it was brought up by another player in a Top 10 Horror Games of 2014 list. So with that said, I cannot say for sure that this game truly is not worth recomending. I personally cannot recommend it, but if one can't, and nine others can, I say it might be worth giving it a shot if it's on sale. I will edit this review and change the reccomendation to an immediate 'Yes' once I've discovered that it was just a defective download. Because while this game is far from perfect even without the game breaking bugs, it's still an experiance that looks like it's worth checking out.  If just to hear that familiar Silent Hill item pickup sound.",

This games storytelling is quite different from Lone Survivor's, instead of keeping you questioning everything, this games slowly uncovers the story, and while somethings is up to intepretation, most of the story is already settled. This games strength is definitely in the tension of the storytelling. The different characters you meet, the use of young Claire's dream, and the interactive flashbacks is excellent at keeping the player excited for uncovering more.  The game does bring up some really dark subjects, which I do appreciate, though, it falls short when it comes to the controls. In the length of the game it does become repetitive.  It does have a creepy atmosphere, some creepy imagery and a very Lone Survivor'ish art style (which I liked so I'm not complaining). The monsters is not exactly that scary, and the hidding mechanism lacks intensity.  So it really comes down to if you like the story and/or if you can sympathise with the main character. I myself were able to feel for her and while I thought that the story could use a bit more support from the puzzles and different areas, instead of only a few people hidden around the map (I loved those people interactions, though it just didn't feel like it was enough to keep my attention the whole way through), it sure was an emotional rollercoaster through the mind of our protagonist. I will recommend it to those who think that the story sounds intriguing, though don't buy it for the survival horror part of the game, since that has been done a lot better in many other titles.",

I play on normal bc I am new to horror games and its my first time playing the game. But I assume hard and nightmare have more enemies and more complications.
