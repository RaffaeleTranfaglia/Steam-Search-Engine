Dev support is a joke, I honestly thought they gave up on this game a long time ago only to have it come out of early access just to compete with Planet Coaster. It is very unfinished/unstable and I'm not even going to try the Vive VR mode for this very reason. It sucks that I've spent so much time giving this game a chance and I hope others are not duped into supporting this incomplete product.",

Crashes constantly (On a good computer too), lags really bad, very un-user friendly, really hard and slow to make something relatively nice, graphics are awful for a game of this day and the devs are horrible at offering support. this game is far to confusing!",
