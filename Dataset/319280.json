            "review_text": "I for one was pretty unimpressed by the graphics of this one. But once you read into the game's history and the direction it is going for its a great nod to the classic fighting games on yesteryear. YTG is a great and simple fighting game but always fun. Matches are at a good pace and combos are a lot easier to pull off than your SF4 FADC tight links etc. Sure the game has tight links in places but they are not really required. Netcode is amazing with the ability to adjust the input delay at the character select screen with O and P. O = decrease delay (best at lower pings), P = increase delay (smoother gameplay at higher pings). This feature alone should be in every single fighting game.   Pros: Cheap Simplicity of combat with a added complexity of parrying to step your game up Good cast of characters and commentators Netcode adjustments are pretty amazing  Cons: For a game released in 2015 can't it at least be in 16:9 with some trim on the sides like guilty gear for instance? Can be hard to find matches online with such a small player base (accurate to early access) Overall UI isn't great but then you are not in the menu's for much of the game so its not game breaking",

            "review_text": "  Summary:    A solid fighting game of the old 2D fighting game era, that focuses on the basic strikes and give and take gameplay of games like King of Fighters. The game definitely has a reasonable cast of characters that feels appropriate for the genre and fight a bit differently without being overly different in their usage, and the paired down move list gives a more simple yet satisfying experience for the fighting game enthusiast. The game probably shouldn't have come out of early access in my opinion, as the polish around the edges especially with UI and in game inconsistency in elements is apparent after playing for a period of time, but that doesn't overlook the good solid fighting base here. It's no Skullgirls, but if you're looking for competitive fighting at a low cost, this may be up your alley.

            "review_text": "Been playing for a bit today. I have quite a bit of experience in fighter playing competition for over 15 years and in arcades since I could reach the stick. The game feels solid and has nice mechanics. This combines the kof type 4 button style with Third strike (3S) parries for 4 buttons.   Parrying in this game now has big consequences compared to 3S and are done with one of two buttone (high or low). On the ground if hit you take more damage and more hitstun, in the air a failed parry allows you to be juggled 5 more times for huge damage. Universal overhead give combos when hit on crouching opponent and mostly neutral on block. There are some commmand normals, such as the grappler must hit df+hk to sweep.  The animation has a 3S style and the game feels nice and responsive. You get to pick your super like 3S as well. This very much feels like its own game. The cast does have some influences from 3S and 'clones' play nothing like each other.  I'll update this the more I play, but this is definitely solid so far. GGPO will be added later and many good players say the netcode is comparable to USF4 on a good connection. This will only get better with GGPO.  Give this game a chance.",

I tried playing it with a 360 pad and all the buttons worked, but the thumbstick didnt get picked up. It has no aspect ratio options. It has a lot of unexplained mechanics, which after most of the fighters that have come out recently having huge portions of single player taken up by tutorials, is off putting. This would be fine in any other type of game, but there is a reason other fighters do that. While i recommend it as a fighter, im waiting for a few technical fixes until I pick it up proper.",

            "review_text": "Yatagarasu is pretty OK. First, the good:  1. Plays well. You feel in control of your character at all times. 2. Deep, complex mechanics. 3. Most of the spritework is pretty great. 4. Inspired by Street Fighter III: Third Strike, my favorite fighting game of all time.  The nitpicks: 1. Older versions of the character art were actually cleaner and nicer looking. 2. Multiple character clones. 3. The story is... well... just pretend it isn't there. 4. The stage art clashes with the character art pretty badly at times.  The bad: 1. Online play is confusing as hell. Port forwarding and technical setup aside, when you join a lobby, you have no control over the cursor unless you are host. Lack of any chat feature means you are basically waiting for the host to decide who gets to fight who and set the match up. 2. GGPO is supposedly coming in a future update. The game needs it now. The slowdown and online wierdness is pretty bad as it currently is. Being able to set the frame delay before the fight is great, but doesn't solve the problem. 3. The mechanics are deep to the point of craziness. You will need to look up guides online to figure out how this is played.  The game is pretty good, once GGPO finally comes along (the dev team is staying tight-lipped as to when this will happen) I can see myself playing this for a long time. Right now, though, I play a bit of arcade and training mode and have fun. Then after trying to play online I don't want to touch it for a while, which is sad.",

            "review_text": "It's a fun game. It has good netcode, great music, and a good variety of fun to play characters.   BUT  , there are some issues that as of now haven't been fixed, for example if you try to do a qcf with and Xbox 360 controller anolog stick it will input down, forward, forward most if not all of the time. z's are input as forward, down forward, I think you get the idea. In order to fix it you need to do a lot of tedious stuff that whenever I try it, it still doesn't work. It's most definitely not a controller issue as it works fine with other fighting games, such as Skullgirls and BlazBlue. I know that Xbox 360 controllers aren't the best thing for most fighting games but it should still be fixed.    TL;DR  : If you have a fightstick or you are willing to use the keyboard and you like traditional fighting games, buy this game, you will enjoy it, its really good. If not, don't buy it.",

            "review_text": "Yeah, it is pretty enjoyable. Yatagarasu Attack on Cataclysm is a successor to an older project simply called Yatagarasu. Its more of an update to that than a sequel in all honesty and that is okay. I backed this when it was having it's crowdfunding attempt and paying the bare minimum to get the game I did not expect future content beyond the alpha and was pleasantly surprised to be wrong. The game itself is fun. It is a six button fighting game like some Capcom and similiar titles, but at heart it is more SNK feeling and considering it is a game from former SNK devs it is no surprise. The 6 buttons consist of two punches, two kicks, and two parry buttons for high and low. Right out of the gate there is one thing I really do not like about the game, but I will say that is just an issue I have with fighting games in general and that aside it is a solid game worth getting. My issue with the parry buttons is mostly not liking button based parry mechanics in general and making it two whole buttons continues to bother me. All of the characters are well designed and fun, but they are mostly very basic. Besides a typical grappler, shoto, and so on they make little effort to innovate, but others are a bit more unique and even the ones who are not are chaming in their own right. Kotaro especially proved to be my favourite of the cast for this reason. Speaking of charming one of the more unique is the announcer system. Immediately after you pick a character you are expected to pick an announcer(or not if you are boring) from a selection of various Japanese and FGC figures or even the characters themeselves which is weird and funny to do and I enjoy it. You can even pick the mood of them between standard 'peaceful' and 'unlimited' which does not seem to hold too much of a difference but will get different lines from your preferred announcer at times. The community is sadly not very active to my knowledge these days, but they are there and the game itself is still a good fighting game. The DLC might be a bit overpriced($30 for a couple of voices is insane) but its all extra stuff. None of the key content was cut from the game to make the DLC and the game itself is small, but very well made. Another recommended good fighting game for Steam!",
