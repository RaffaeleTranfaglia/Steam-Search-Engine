            "review_text": "First thing to notice about this game I guess, is it's not pretty to look at, irregardless of how old it is. The landscapes are terrible, even for post apocalyptica, the cars are really simple, and the UI is downright terrible. Visually it really has nothing going for it. Even the sound is somewhat irritating.  BUT, you don't play this for aesthetics... You play it because of the amazing physics rich turned based combat/racing. Once you get used to the UI, this game really starts to shine. At the start of each turn you change steering, gears, weapon targetting, etc. and once it's all set watch the next 3-4 seconds play out. This gets hectic when you're racing against a large group of players.  The real beauty lies in how each action follows through subsequent turns. Made that hard right a little too hard? the next 3-4 turns will be spent countersteering, and when it works... oh boy does it work. Pulling off successful drifts, jumps, etc gives you a real sense of accomplishment. Combined with terrain realistically affecting your cars handling and you have racing that equals any AAA racing simulators.  I've been playing this on and off for the past 4 years, so don't let the steam counter fool you. I highly recommend at least trying this out. Once you get past the unfriendly UI and get to the actual racing, you'll have a hell of a time.",

So let me make a list this time of Pros And Cons: PROS- - Good physics - Attachment to Crew - Variety of maps to Race, Deathrace, Arena or even Scout - Unique, I haven't seen one game try turn based car fights CONS- - Non steam Login - Waiting Time So at the end, the pros outway the cons so now that I have given it a second try my final score is.... 7/10, worth the download space, and a good game of you don't know what to do at that time.",

What it lacks in visual polish, clearly delivers satisfying in-game physics and combat. Throw Mad Max together with a Twisted Metal concept, add in-depth strategy and satisfying vehicle/character customization, and you have Darkwind. 10/10",

Pros:  Minimal hardware required  Free to play (mostly) Dedicated community Cons: Need to buy a subscription to exit the northern Triangle of towns Graphics are a bit out dated Time consuming moderate learning curve  All in all 10/10 It is a very interesting game and fun to play. The community is freaking amazing, and the concept is awesome However i will warn you it takes a few days/weeks to get acclimated to the controls and concepts. If you have trouble ask for help odds are someone will try to help you.  ",

It is just as tense as any realtime racing. The game is free so you've got nothing to lose when it comes to trying it.  While the release date on Steam is in 2014, the game is actually from 2007. Then again, games back then still looked better, but this game is mostly a one man show as far as I know. Again, graphics don't really matter when the gameplay is solid so give it a try. A lot of people are complaining at this game for various reasons but most of them haven't even given it a proper try.",
