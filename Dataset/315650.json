MIGHT have been nice to have leaderboards based on times/getting the stars etc. - but then someone would only cheat so maybe not...",

            "review_text": "Deep Under the Sky is a physics puzzler (wait come back) that might be the best chillout game I've ever played. You control a crazy-♥♥♥-looking space jellyfish on Venus as it wanders around and produces offspring. I use the term 'control' in the loosest possible way because like the screenshot says, this game only has one button. At the start of every level the jellyfish settles into place and cannot be moved. Your one button launches an egg pod offspring thing in a set trajectory. The icons in the bottom left are the different effects that pushing your one button will have on its movement. There are directional boosts, rolling, bouncing, and of course, exploding. Your goal is to get the pod close enough to the glowing stalks to explode and plant a new offspring there.  The limited controls mean puzzles tend to be pretty obvious and open to trial-and-error. Some levels have a lot of different travel powers to use that open things up more, but mostly you'll just be using your one or two directional boosts at slightly different times and seeing where your pod ends up. The game is nice enough to show you the path of your last pod, so if you were close to your target last time you can use that as a handy reference. The visuals are weird and busy in a pleasant way, and there's a lot of detail in the particle effect. The soundtrack is a perfect low-key synth thing to relax to as you fling alien spores around. Each stage has two stars in tricky places for completionists to find, and there's about 80 levels to float through. I played it for about 30 minutes and beat the first chapter (20 levels), and when I sat down later to play something else... I actually booted this up again for a bit. It's a great little filler game, not too taxing on the mind and with lots of pretty sights and sounds to keep you occupied.",

This game fit the bill and as expected I really love the colors and music. However you should know that you only press space bar to play and you are constrained to certain limitations they set. The game is 100% about the timing of when you press space bar. Creative concept, beautiful layout, and unique gameplay. I'd recommend it.. but just barely. I wish it had more of an adventure feel.",
