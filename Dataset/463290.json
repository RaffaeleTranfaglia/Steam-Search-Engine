            "review_text": "  Kismet: ~~~~~~  The human is race is an incredible species. From the day we experience gravity to the day we are transported into eternity, we keep learning and trying to position ourselves to create a bright future. However, sometimes we procrastinate when deciding which direction we should follow. Wouldn’t it be nice to have a little hint once in a while? I know, I need to pay a visit to the extraordinary Mrs Kismet; she’ll have the answer!  Kismet is a casual/atmospheric virtual reality fortune teller experience. At Mrs Kismet’s place, you can have your question(s) answered via a set of tarots cards, where you will have to pick three cards (past, present and future) out of the twenty-two from the deck. Then Mrs Kismet will explain the meaning of the cards and you will be the only one to interpret the answer to your question. If you are more inclined towards Astrology, then just put your date of birth in the calendar in front of you (on the table) and your astrology chart will be displayed and briefly explained on a daily basis if you desire. Otherwise, Mrs Kismet loves to play an ancient game called, “Royal Game of Ur” - a board game which was played in 2600 BC. Also known as “Asseb” in ancient Egyptian times, archaeologists found it in the pharaoh, Tutankhamen’s, tomb with a tablet which partially describes how the game was played. And now you have the privilege of enjoying it with your host, Mrs Kismet. Just mind-blowing, and a very nice touch!  I really like the atmosphere of the fortune-teller caravan; the cat is moving around, the discovery of the décor is superb, the cards are detailed and you can pick them up and put them close to your face and hear sounds. A beautiful astrology chart appears in front of and around you - just magical! The desert location when playing the game of “Ur” with Egypt-Persian statues (maybe Sphynx) is great!  As I am an owner of the recommended Steam Virtual Reality headset for a couple of weeks now and own several games so far, I strongly recommend “Kismet”. To give you an idea, I decided to initiate my family with a session last night, and even my mother, who generally feels quite daunted by this type of thing, was absolutely amazed with the experience. If you have a party at home and want to introduce Virtual Reality to your guests, well do not look further, Kismet is the way to go!   Positives: ~~~~~~~   - Great atmosphere - Great Graphics  - Nice Voice over - Detailed Tarot cards  - Daily astrology session - Great for initiating people into the VR experience  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Short activities  8/10  Kismet is a stunning VR experience! In fact, this is the first title I would choose to initiate newcomers into VR!  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!

            "review_text": "This is one of the most polished VR experiences I have yet tried. The level of detail in all of the pieces and environments are so well done. While there is not a large amount of depth, it more than makes up for it in polish. Voice acting is also top notch and the character design is both unsettling and beautiful.   Would highly recommend this as something to demo to other people. It's a low risk (in physical movement) demo with gorgeous environments and sense of scale.",

You have 3 main things to do, get a tarot card reading, a horoscope prediction based on your date of birth and finally this funny little game of dice somewhat reminding me of backgammon but in a very persiany-exotic setting.  Content seems somewhat lacking and it would've been nice to be able to interract with things in Kismet's hut but you get what you pay for I suppose.  Also my sense of scale was a bit off as the floor in the experience was somewhere just below my knees which was a bit confusing to be honest. Devs might wanna look into that I think.  ",
