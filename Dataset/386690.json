    "description": "A surreal building game for VR. Create life-sized contraptions as tall as you can reach, then send them whirling, flinging, and trundling off to solve puzzles on the other side of a floating island. There are no right or wrong solutions, so bring your creativity.",

            "review_text": "'Fantastic Contraption' is a great puzzle game that is seriously hampered in later levels by many physics, UI, design, and quality issues. These issues are relatively minor, but ultimately extremely frustrating because of how many other things this game does so well.  It feels GREAT to just start grabbing pieces and building a contraption. The actual physical movements are intuitive, for the most part. When everything works together, you can enact your idea in no time flat. When your idea works, you're on cloud nine -- the physical nature of the building helps lend a feeling of true ownership and accomplishment when your contraption solves the puzzle at hand.  However, there are several issues that can dissolve the bond between idea and action. These issues are relatively minor, but as the puzzles get more complex, the uncertainty and instability caused by these issues turn a fun and engaging puzzle game into an exercise of sheer frustration.  As of this current version, here are my collection of issues that I have noted...   Section 1: Lack of tutorialization or documentation",

It's incredibly intuitive to maneuver the pieces in any position.  One of the best ideas in the game is the inventory system. Need a stick? Reach over your shoulder. Looking for glue? Reach in your ear.  Using the helmet as the main menu is absolutely brilliant.  The most complaints I've heard about this game is the price. Hopefully the devs move in that direction, but overall this game really impressed me. I've played well over 30 Vive and oculus games and I still got a kick out of this one.",

That said however, I didn't really enjoy it. The physics work correctly, and the puzzles aren't all easy, but there was just something missing for me. Perhaps lack of parts? You really only have a wheel and two types of sticks to build with, so simplicity is it's essence. I tried it a few times because free, but unfortunately it is now at the bottom of my list of games to play again.",
