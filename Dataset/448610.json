While the game may look like a cheap flash knock off, I found it quite enjoyable and was a delight to play. However this game is a bit too laggy and is prone to bad/unresponsive controls but not enough to completely destroy the experience.",

Mutiple skins    Cons:    Levels can be bland   Lack of traction makes slopes impossibel to climb   Fustration (comes with the type of game)   Personal things:   Lack of color (neither pro nor con)   For 2 eurs its a fun game with a good editor thats perfect to kill time with or just keep banging a stickfigure head against a wall at the game.",
