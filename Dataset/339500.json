            "review_text": "This is a simple and fun physics-based castle siege game, though at the moment there's not much going for it.   In terms of game mechanics there is not a whole lot -- 6 ammo types and 3 spells -- mostly stuff you can find in a lot of flash games. The gameplay feels rather bland too, despite the variety of tools available. It's pretty much shoot any enemies that shoot back, then mash away at the building. The several dozen different levels help alleviate the feeling of grinding through the game, and an in-game level editor allows for some creative fun, so it could be worse.  As far as presentation goes the game uses a pixelated aesthetic and the building tiles look a little Terraria-like.   Updates are planned though, so it might get more interesting. At the moment though I find it hard to recommend the game at full price.",
