            "review_text": "So, it's not often I'm wrong, but I have to admit how wrong I was.  After giving the game another 5 or so hours under the tutelage of a veteran player who showed me the ropes, its quite honestly a marvel of a game. Thats not to say there arent some issues, as there are, like a dated graphics engine, in game purchases for expanding tracks and drivable vehicles as well as having a limited pool of cars to drive. But all in all, an excellent Simulation that doesn't pretend to be anything its not. You just have to give it some time and love and it will give back.  50 hours in: Had a number of issues purchasing iRacing content through Steam. iRacing support very helpful. Steam support completely lackluster. Been running the Global Challenge series in the Cadillac. Looking at working back through the Skip Barber series and on up to the Star Mazda series. Also, to get the most from this game, you 'have' to use a steering wheel and pedals. Controllers just dont cut it!  Original review included for posterity, 'Pretty average game. Confusing web interface that keeps asking for steam approval. Waste of $39.'",

            "review_text": "I started iRacing about a year ago. I was always into racing, but never could afford a decent wheel/pedal setup.  I found out about iRacing right before my birthday and the idea of fair internet racing fascinated me... so i built myself a rig and jumped into the world of online racing. Ill sum up some of my expiriences with the simulation in this review, trying to give you some insight on how your view will change when you get better and better.     Prior racing games/simulations:    I've been driving the oldschool NFS titles (the old Hot Pursuit and so on) and some F1 titles, but always with a game pad so i had no prior wheel expirience approaching iRacing (hell, i didnt even have a driving license at that time).     My first weeks at iRacing:    I started out with the Mazda MX5 which is free from the beginning and got right into the frey. I started a privat test session and drove a few laps, quickly realising this was not comparable to anything i had ever driven before.  I immediatly learned that you have to invest time in iRacing to become save and good enough to drive on a racetrack with others. And thats before you even think about doing competetive laptimes. While this is a starting obstacle you have to overcome it is also deeply satisfying to finally get into your first race after proper training. I started out of the pits and propably was driving on my own at the back of the field, but i did my first race and the feeling when crossing the finish line unharmed was absolutley great.  I went on to practised on and quickly climbed through the license levels. Getting from Rookie to a D license was my first big acomplishment and i was proud as f***. :P  An important note about license levels: They are not about how fast you are, they are about how save you are! That is a huge difference. I'd rather have a slower driver in the field, who has his car under control instead of a guy who is quick as hell, but will most likely crash after 5 laps. If you just keep your nose out of trouble and work on your driving skills, advancing from Rookie to an A class driver is not that hard.    My driving expirience now (about 10 months after my initial start - by now i am using an Oculus Rift DK2):    I am having an absolute blast. Really. I don't even dare to call iRacing a game anymore, its a racing simulation and it does an incredible job. I am mostly driving the GT3 cars and i actually am quite good at them, being able to drive highly competetive laptimes. I can still get the other cars around the track, but i wont win a race in them. Putting my focus on a single car helped me to become a very save and quick driver in the GT3 series. I shifted from the official races to Community leagues and am now mostly racing endurance events with 4hours + racing time with my teammate.  There are some races where i crash out, there are some races where i get taken out, there are some races where i just hotlap for half an hour because everyone else is either quicker or slower than me. And then i have those amazing 45 minutes battles other drivers which are at my exact pace. And everytime i am in such a race, i have a huge idiotic grin all over my face when im done. Its just such a great feeling when you are driving close to your limits and have a fair battle with someone else. You will litteraly start to shake and sweat and when you are leading a race for the first time you might become so nervous that you drop out of your chair. And it feels great!  Even now i still get nervous at starts of big, important races. When im standing somewhere in the mid-front of a 60 car field at Spa and am waiting for the Safety car to drive us through the warm-up lap i still shake. In my mind i am already racing down the hill towards Eau-Rouge and get crazily excited. I remind myself that ive got a 2 hours race ahead of me and that i only have to survive the start. The engines start spitting... and everything from there on is in my hands.     TL;DR: Here is a list of what i love about this game and about what is a little bit annoying.     Pro:    + Great physics, really fun to drive + Good graphics (and they will become even better) + Friendly Community on the Road side, i dont know much about Ovals + Amazing, clean races (yes you will crash at times, but thats racing my friend) + A huge track pool and a lot of cars that feel completly different from each other + An extremly high level of competition at the top + Racing with people that have your pace, no matter if you are super quick or just having a chilled sunset drive + The amazing feeling that you actually achieved something, when you win your first race after hours of training + In deep setup building (the faster the car, the more options you get) + The game sound (way better than AC imo).    Cons:   - You will have to invest training time to become good, but training is also fun, especially with others on the track! - iRacing is not cheap, but in case that you cant afford real live racing, it gets as close as can be. - Its adicting.   This review sounds really positive does it? Well, thats because i am absolutley in love with iRacing. I spent 200+ hours in the BMW alone and i am not the quickest guy yet. Time to head back into a practise session, cya folks!",

            "review_text": "DONT EVEN CALL IT A GAME!   Because it's not, This is a Tool for training how to drive REAL race cars at fast speeds! Profesional drivers use iRacing, to LEARN a race track that they may have never been to in real life yet, weeks in advance of traveling there in real life! Dale Earnhardt Jr. is one of those professional Drivers who has Attested to having done exactly that! iRacing is so accurate to real life, that the same Cracks, Bumps and Grooves that are in the pavement that you can see on T.V. and see in the famous Indianapolis Raceway, Are there in iRacing IN EXACT DETAIL down to the MILIMETER! They use Laser Scanning to make an IDENTICAL COPY of the real track! So tracks that maybe have small Banking on a 90 degree turn in real life, you might race that same track in Forza or Asseto Corsa, and be forced to take that turn WAY SLOWER than in real life thus negatively affecting your lap times, and you cannot compare your lap times in whatever car you just drove on that track to the professionals who drive that track in that identical car in real life! Whereas with iRacing you can take a lap time at say Daytona Speedway in an Actual GEN-6 NASCAR RaceCar or Indy Car, and then Compare it to ANY Real Nascar or INDY driver's REAL Qualifying TIME on that track in that same car in real life to see how you stack up! NO OTHER RACING GAME HERE ON STEAM CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM and truely back it up, time after time...on track after track!   So i say again, Dont go thinking this is a 'GAME' because this.... if anything, is a way for you to develop real life skills that you could take into a real life race car and start a racing career with. (if you dont believe it, look up iRacings World champions, Many of them have done exactly that, and used iRacing as a launchng point for their real life racing career's!   So basically, if you like Arcade style racing games but dont like watching competitive MotorSports in real life, Wishing you could be the guy or girl driving that car at 200 plus miles an hour,.....Then iRacing may not be for you. And the reason i say this is, in iRacing there is no Rewinding time if you hit a wall or something, theres no buying PARTS UPGRADES, theres no cheat codes or 'TURBO BOOST BUTTON', And if you dont have a steering wheel and aren't prepared to race the way a REAL driver would race, then you will seriously be having a hard time with it when you rise out of your Rookie License's in both Road and Oval Racing! (Although every once in a while people on X-Box controlers can do QUITE decently, BUT, it takes A LOT LONGER to get good at mastering an X-box's Joystick to get through a particular turn's 'Apex' without missing a beat, And to be comepletely honest here....Most of the people i've talked to who started out on X-Box Controllers like that, IMMEDIATELY went and bought a steering wheel and pedals!Which despite being a bit of an Investment, you need to remember you're investing in Real Life skills you can use Every day to drive safer, OR Even take these skills into a real Race car in real life! So is that worth a few hundred dollars?...You BET IT IS!)     One thing i learned EARLY ON in my still very young iRacing Career, which was something SO OBVIOUS, i completely 'FACEPALMED' myself once i truely REALIZED that i was so Naive' to believe it!....And this was how i've been SubConciously TRAINED over the years without realizing it, that all these Movies and 'arcade style' racing games make you think that you can just FLOOR the gas pedal through a wreck, and things like touching a wall with the front fender does no damage to the car, or, driving alongside another car and you bump his Left Rear Fender, and nothing happens whereas in real life the wreck that you would cause Could be catastrophic to ALL cars involved!, And in those games and movies you catch the competition pretty fast if you fall behind because they have 'catch up speed' toggle-able! Or if theres a wreck up ahead you can just Floor the gas pedal and push the other cars out of your way!....   And in iracing NONE OF THAT IS TRUE! This is REAL DEAL, REAL LIFE RACING AGAINST REAL DRIVERS (Some of whom Race on weekends at their Local Track in Real life, and have Years of Training over your skills!) And you must Drive as competitively as you can WITHOUT making contact with other cars &amp; walls as best you can! Touch a wall and spin out and cause damage to your car? If that happens you can't just expect to pull a manuever like when playing 'NEED FOR SPEED' and pull back out, onto the track and race right back up to first place!    Your damage has REAL AFFECTS on your engine performance, Wheel alignment, and Aerodynamics! If all of that car isn't in pristine condition, you are SEVERELY HINDERING yourself! And in most cases a pit-in or Towing all the way back into the pits is necessary, and just be prepared that in 'ROOKIES' you will see it happen multiple times per race where someone will spin, cause a wreck with another car, and then get back and keep going, not realizing that the now damaged car they are driving is slower and now a danger to others as they try to pass that damaged car at high speed!    Now as for Pricing: There are those who complain about the price, but the prices they charge AREN'T to line their pockets with money like these $60 dollar a game, Arcade Style Racing games! When iracing Charges you THE MINIMUM PRICE THAT THEY CAN, Give you A BUNCH OF FREE CONTENT WITH YOUR FIRST PURCHASE of the service, And EVEN Allow your Races to contribute to your 'Store Credit'!! They do all of that, Just so after you pay about $40. Dollars to get started with iRacing, you have pretty much all the tracks and Cars you need to compete for a few months without having to pay anything else! But when iRacing charges me. $11.95 for a car that i want to race that season $14.95 for a track, i HAPPILY pay that because iRacing is setup to charge each driver the MINIMUM it can in order for our purchases of those cars and tracks to fund the development of FUTURE TRACKS AND CARS!    So imagine Like me you live on a Disability income and since like me you live near Laguna Seca (Or whatever Real life track near you, that you wished you could've Competed at!), you've wished your whole life you could get into Racing Profesionally, But Like me, Despite your parents WANTING to get you into the sport, couldn't afford it for you when you were young...    Now picture for Roughly $40 bucks and the Price of a Decent Steering wheel and pedal setup, i can take a Porsche out on that track and finally LIVE THAT DREAM! And finally, for MUCH CHEAPER than it costs to drive a REAL RaceCar, i can Learn, and study from Professional Drivers! I can even Race AGAINST REAL PRO's IF I KEEP practicing and get good enough! About a year ago a 17yr old Kid who won the Iracing Championship NASCAR series is now Announced plans to get into racing in Real life! And he's only been Racing in iRacing for 5 or 6 years! And it shows that this isnt some 'GAME' to go play to unwind, This is a severely competitive Adrenaline rush inducing Simulation of the REAL THING!     In Closing, the rule of thumb you can apply to both real life racing and iRacing is that much like Real life Racing the Competitive level is REAL! NO OTHER RACING GAME OR ANY VIDEO GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED, has EVER truely given me 'BUTTERFLIES' just from the level of sheer excitement you get in a rolling start before that green flag drops! Especially since you are being given the opportunity to drive against people who are just as fast, or if not faster than you are!    No other Racing Game or Even Regular Computer Game has EVER been able to TRUELY provide that 'BUTTERFLIES IN THE STOMACH' Feeling to drivers and gamers alike! Not in the way that iRacing does! And i can attest to it, having nearly 200 steam Games, that Despite it being a bold statement it is 100% TRUE!",

Some years ago I tried Live For Speed and was hooked on it for several months, I can say that this was my first true simulation experience. In that time I played some NetKar, rFactor, F1 and SimBin games too.  From then, my wheel and pedals had been quietly standing in a box. Until I tried out Assetto Corsa recently, which got me instantly hooked.  I progressed in the career, did some hotlapping, the sim is amazing. Then I tried the multiplayer... and well, I was disappointed. In some races I was leading, and near the end some wrecker would take me down smiling. Trying to kick this guys from the server, no one votes, no one cares. No sanctioning whatsoever.  I saw iRacing with a 3 months free promo, and just WOW... this is a completely different story. From the start, from the behaviour of the car you can notice that it is a simulation, and not something made to entertain. And when you figure out the way the races are structured, the licences, the leagues, you forget everything else.  To progress in the sim you have to BE SAFE, you don't have to be fast. This is a requirement, and surely helps teaching new players how to behave in the track. You start out in the rookie class, and you'll wanna get out of it as soon as possible, since this class acts as a 'filter', all the wreckers-who-wanna-win-in-the-first-corner are there. As soon as you progress to D class, the quality of the drivers is noticeable better. You can easily achieve this in 1 or 2 days.  Clean racing, fairplay. This is what separates iRacing from the rest.  The netcode is by far the best I ever tried. All the servers belong to iRacing, so this also helps to deliver the best experience, almost without lags and dissapearing cars.  In relation to pricing, I probably end up saving money. Instead of buying that random Steam game that eventually I wouldnt even play, the only thing I spend now is on iRacing.  But in the end, they deserve every penny, because you get quality from the service. In any case, you don't have to buy anything in the beginning. You can progress as you'll like, and stay with the included cars and tracks only. You'll have plenty of time to decide on which career path you wanna follow (open wheel/close wheel, oval/road racing, etc).  This is a simulator that demands true effort, but it pays back with the best racing moments you'll ever get from a computer.  Warning: Expect to be completely addicted and spending MUCH more time that you've predicted, on this game. You've been warned! :)",

You can even look at my library: I own Assetto Corsa, pCars, rFactor 2, some Grid games, etc. I've played all the Forza and GT games.   iRacing is a tier of it's own. It's an amazing online experience with an in-depth career: Your own. It doesn't use fancy gimmicks to create a career mode, it doesn't have a lot of silly nonsense like vehicle upgrades. Just pure motorsports. It has in-depth garage menu, allowing for a large amount of customization with your vehicles, and replicates almost all the features you would expect in the cars.   But the biggest feature it offers is it's amazing community and online racing experience. Due to how the rule structures are set, iRacing boasts one of the best online communities in terms of Admin/Player interactions, as well as how serious people will race together. I have had some of the closest races in my life in iRacing.   Do I think it's the only racing game anyone should play? No. There are other games with many other features, like rFactor 2's amazing Real Road feature, but iRacing is the only multiplayer experience most people need.   Some Pro's and Con's  Pros: -Amazing Online Community -Fantastic 'Career' implementation. Your stats are permanent, and are kept track through iRating and Safety Rating. You work your way up from rookie series, up into the A class, which can be easy for some, or take forever (like me! Only because I don't race alot) -Graphics are spot on. They aren't 'fancy' by any means, but they do try to accurately portray every curb, sign, and lamp post. Even going so far and getting the mailboxes at Bathurst modelled. (And a deer stand in a tree) -Physics are improving constantly. (Despite how people on the forum argue otherwise) -Amazing selection of series and cars, as well as support for many different play styles, such as Controller, wheel, or even TABLET. (Wheel is recommended though)  Cons: -Pricey compared to other games, cheap compared to real world forms of racing. (Even a decent family Go-Kart track is like $18, so iRacing is cheaper than one race at K1 Speed) -When newer versions of a car come out, they require you to pay for them. You keep the old ones, and they offer it at a discount, but this is due to licensing restrictions and based mostly on how many members subscribe. -Takes time and practice. Not good for easy pick up and play -Confusing web interface. Everything is done on a website. EVERYTHING. It's probably the best one out there, but still confusing for some. -Tracks take FOREVER to release. Becuase they're well made. But this leads to issues like Lime Rock not being updated in 3-4 years, because Lime Rock keeps CHANGING THEIR TRACK EVERY 6 MONTHS AND I BLAME LIME ROCK FOR THIS ONE.   Anyways, Great sim. I enjoy it. If you don't want to pay a subscription, you can play rFactor 2, Assetto Corsa, or ANY OTHER various games. :) But I'd at least say you should give this a try and actually talk to people. Cause people are AWESOME.",

Do you like GT? yes? so, this simulator is for you  6.- Do you want to race in perfect laser official scanned road courses and ovals? yes? so, this simulator is for you  7.- Do you want to feel and race with the best car physics in the market right now? yes? so, this simulator is for you  8.- Are you a old papyrus fan like me (GPL, NR2003)? yes? so, this simulator is for you  So,..... What are you waiting for!!?? sign up RIGHT NOW  Im not going to lie to you, this simulator is expensive, you will have to pay a fee (monthly, 6 months or yearly, your choice) and you will have to buy the content that you want for you to complete the seasons past the rookie license, but as soon as you have what you want you will no longer have to spend a dime, because iracing pays you to race, yeah, thats right, you will be earning money, each year you will make 40$ and after the year iracing will give you another 5$ as a gift, so, that 45$ (iracing credits, only for the purchases inside the sim). So, here is the deal: In the summer or in the black friday sale you can renew the service for a year for only 49.99$, so 45$ that you have made minus 49.99$= five bucks, yep, as you can see the simulator is almost free, and trust me, if you like racing like me that price is a good deal because you will not find anything like iracing, this is by far the best simulator on the world, and the multiplayer is the best thing Ive ever seen in my entire gaming life (and Im a old fart), so well organized, lag free and the community is amazing and helpful.  Also, awnser this simple question again: do you like Nascar? yes? really?, are you a Nascar fan? look no further, this is your house, welcome my fellow Nascar racer, Ive been expecting you, this is the real deal, all the rules, the sponsors, the ovals and road courses, the cars, the trucks, and so much more, all in here in iracing.  Oh! and I almost forgot!! this is a ongoing project, new deals are being made with the track owners and cars manufacturers for new content (like lemans and the ring, both coming soon) and they are updating the simulation with new builds regularly (for example, dynamic heat on the track surface).  Look at this as an investment for your happiness, but beware, YOU WILL BE ADDICTED and the races are intense and so real, this is not for the casual gamer, this is some serious stuff, really.",

            "review_text": "iRacing is one of the best MICROTRANSACTIONS game, with full access to laser-scanned MONTHLY FEES and a good MICROTRANSACTIONS community. Unlike in other sims such as Assetto Corsa, here you have a MONTHLY FEES system where you can MICROTRANSACTIONS and race with MICROTRANSACTIONS at your skill level. You start at the MONTHLY FEES level and progress up to MICROTRANSACTIONS level, but you require MICROTRANSACTIONS in order to rank up and MONTHLY FEES with better MICROTRANSACTIONS driving fast MICROTRANSACTIONS.  This game has a lot of MONTHLY FEES and laser-scanned MICROTRANSACTIONS, with an outstanding MICROTRANSACTIONS quality that doesn't need to show post-processing MICROTRANSACTIONS and other useless effects to appear eyecandy enough.  As I said, this game has a good MICROTRANSACTIONS community. They are open to MONTHLY FEES and constantly telling newcomers how to MICROTRANSACTIONS in order to progress and MONTHLY FEES well.

The racing is good clean fun with Lots of cars and tracks with great physics and laser scanned so you get every bunp and pothole.  You start in Rookie mode and work your way to up to pro (easyer than i make it sound). You can drive road or ovel tracks and pick a path that suits your style of driving. Rookie is where you will find the , shall we say, fender benders but even this is not too bad if you just keep out of trouble and finish each race without any offtracks or bumps. The only thing thatlets it down is the cars and track can cost a lot of real money, up to $15 per track and $11 per car although you do get a few free cars and tracks to get you started. So if you want to race a full season then get ready to pay over $100 and its monthly subscrption fee. So, if you want to play a good simulator then this is it for me! happy driving    ",

            "review_text": "Unfortuantely I had to change the review from a yes to a no.   My review was based on the premise that 'iRacing is expensive, but...'. Well, it's just turning more expensive with a small price increase.  The price increase is too small to have a significant impact, but in my review you'll also see that my judgement on the pricing was based on the 50% off subscription discount they've offered twice a year every year. That's when/how everyone I know bought their subscriptions.  Coming this summer, the 50% sale is nerfed to a 25% sale. Many disagree, but to me that's a somewhat significant price increase in disguise.   There were also commonly big credit discounts, in which you paid $75 for $100 in credits. Those haven't been seen in a while either, and haven't been anounced when they anounced the price increase. Not having access to those discounts means credits got %33 more expensive than usual.  At the end of the day it's up to you to decide what's 'expensive', 'cheap', or 'worth it'. It's still the best simulator in the market by far, and it is unparalleled on the competitive side of things. But at this point I can't just make a 'yes' recommendation with a clear conscience.  ___________________________________  Previous review - 19 Dec, 2015  We can already take a couple of things out of the way. If you want a game to play with AI, or if you want to plug in an XBox controller and just bash and bang your car around a track non-stop, then this is not for you.   But if you want 'as real as it gets' racing against  real  opponents, in laser-scanned as real as it gets tracks and cars? Then this is not at all perfect but there's just no better option than this. Not even close. There never was, there is not at the moment, and it doesn't look like anyone will get any close any time soon.  To me the choice to recommend it is easy. Firstly, because I can't stand racing against AI. This is partially because no AI is actually realistic enough, and partially because -- to me -- racing is as much a mental game as it is a physical one. There's no feeling like cracking your opponent under pressure, forcing her into a mistake, etc. This, to me, is the pinnacle of racing and it's something that is not even on the table when racing against AI.  And secondly, because of the race organization and availability. I've been in numerous leagues that used numerous sims throughout the years. I've given up on leagues because there were always too many problems with rules, crashes, track cutting, you name it. For a league to be good, it had to stay small. If it stayed small, there weren't enough races.   From my days in rFactor, countless leagues even migrated to iRacing. So in iRacing you get the best of both worlds, open/pick-up racing  and  leagues, around the clock 7 days a week.   About cost",

(or atleast many years)  For beginners this is a exspensive for just a game, But If you decide to play this sim over someyears you can gradually build up your cars and tracks. Also with alot of promotional codes you recieve each year its not that bad. You can even get a few dollars each season (complete a official season) just for participation.",
