Well let me be another that is in the bad review camp.  I also read that D3-Resurrection was the game that should of been released in the first place. They said they fixed most of the bugs. If that is true then I would hate to play the hot mess that was before this one because there is still tons of bugs. Some of those same reviews said how beautiful the graphics were, are they playing the same game as me? Your move points are very low, so just going to get that gold pile that is about 5 inches away takes two turns. Its also really hard to logically see where you can move on the map without triggering combat. Sometimes during combat there is no walking animation, the units just glide as they move. Most of the time when an archer fires the terrain will block the camera view. Really cheesy! The combat is slow, repetitive and boring. The only real tactical dission is what unit to attack. Then it boils down to just exchanging blows and hope you can win. I dont recommend Disciples III. If interested get Disciples 2 as that is the game the fans fell in love with. ",

This is a new landmark in the history of Nevendaar, when a new race ascends to power – the ruthless and merciless Undead Hordes. It is the story of selfless love and unfading glory. Heroes of the past, who had lost their lives, but not their sentience, are exacting their revenge in the name of Mortis, the Goddess of Death.  This Disciples 3 game is dedicated to a new race – the Undead Hordes. It was the mostly anticipated race among the gamers and fans of the Disciples series, and now their dreams have come true.",

            "review_text": "Modelled after the game format used in Heroes of Might and Magic, and improved upon hugely, Disciples is an engrossing game to play once you've mastered the rather steep learning curve involved. There are two different types of magic, one for use in the battle arenas, and one for use whilst travelling across the world map, and if you don't have your wits about you, neither will make sense. Apart from that the game unfolds nicely (play the main release first, as this is the expansion, even though it plays without the original) and has an involving, if very complicated, storyline.  Watch out for crashes and other curruptions even in the updated version. Always save before going to battle or visiting shops as these tend to create crash points.  They've made changes to the combat system in this exapnsion, and personally I don't think they're for the better. Certain character types (mellee in particulart) now have two slots per battle round, rather than just one, and reinsert themselves high up the turn table when their first turn has been used. This may have been done to balance the difficulty that mellee types normally missed their first round attack as they couldn't cover enough arena squares to reach an enemy. However, mellee types have always had the extra advantage of delivering much more damage than a ranged attack, so this change really wasn't necessary. It actually becomes confusing. That, coupled with a revised 'cover shot' system, whereby you get locked into covering yourself, not just other characters under your control, means the balance of arena battles has been seriouslly jarred and takes a while to figure things out. You can also trap oppsition units into self-cover, so perhasps there is a small up side to this. Like a lot of games, once you'be worked out the system you can play it to your advantage, but it's a tricky system and misjudgements are usually fatal.  On the plus side, Lambert has been brought back from what we thought was the dead,,,,",
