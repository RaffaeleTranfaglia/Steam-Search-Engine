            "review_text": "So fun game so far, slow casual pace with plenty to do. Appears to be a lot to do in order to reach the end. Controls are fine once your used to them and basics are explained well in the tutorial. Visuals are nothing spectacular but are plesant to look at and have found no ingame bugs in my 2hrs of play. Only bug so far is unlocking achievements before you do them. The tycoon part of the game is a very simplified property buying process that only involves money management  as to whens the best time to buy. The end game does involve owning all property though so is a nice incentive to pay attention. The reputation part is an important aspect because when you bid on jobs and property you need to pay attention to who else is bidding cause someone with a much higher rep than yours will drive the price up making it tougher to be profitable. Like that part. So if your looking for a casual way to spend your time yet stay engaged this game is a good buy for the price.",

Buy property when you can to get the win, but it is a bit grindy to get there. Pirates are a bit silly  I got this on sale, in this case for USD$1.99, and it is worth the money at that price. It is probably a 3.5/10 at $9.99 but at $1.99 it is a 6.5",

            "review_text": "I bought this unsure if I would like it after reading mixed reviews, but after playing this for 5 hours straight I quite like this game. You are a water taxi transporting wealthy folk between a archipelago of islands. With money earned you can buy more boats and various property oppotunities that go up for sale during taxi missions. There is always things going on and happening during taxi missions which stops the game from getting boring and keeps it interesting, from pirates (which are right nasty ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s) to throwing life rings to drowning souls. The game can also be enhanced by playing the game with an erection. Its not perfect though, but has a nice balance. I like how the big boats which earn more are more difficult mooring than the small ones. All boats are available to buy at the start of the game, instead of incermentally so you can buy the best boats early on in the game whereas I would have liked to have worked on increasing my rank to get better boats. The AI players also start with a large amount of property and it will take some time on increaing your own portfolio before you are able to buy large amounts of property meaning the AI players will purchase it. The pre-set camera angles can also be awkward, but using my third hand I played this with an Xbox 360 Controller, mouse and keyboard at the same time. Even better as of writing the Dev is listening to players feedback to make improvements and releasing patches to improve the game. While the game might not be for everyone, I am more impressed than I thought I would be.",

Extremely frustrating controls and UI, and random events that pretty much destroy whatever you try to do, make this as anything but the chillout sandbox it seemed to be and should have been.  Buy Depth Hunter 2 instead, right here on Steam.  Or, if you have a Nintendo Wii, pick up Endless Ocean 1 or 2 for that console, because that is what this game seems to aspire to be.   4/10",

Scenery is nice, the atmosphere is there but other things can be a bit annoying. In a way, well it is difficlut to say what kind of game this is. It is party a simple boat simulator, and very small partly management. A few things could easily be done better like those dumb pirates, repetative actions (transporting people), sialing boat bugs etc.  Anyway, if even a new version could come out id definitivly buy it but the quite a bit more should be done to improve the game. I am thinking of more types of boats, customizable boats, faster boats (powerboats should sail faster than a sailing boat), managing and controllling your properties (rents), and please ... if bugs are found fix them. It came out did very few updates and that was it...  For me i give it a 5.5/10, and I really like it. Makes you dream away.  And I appreciate people's review + or - whenever they have played it a decent amount of time.",
