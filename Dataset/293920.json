You can chose one of three different 'characters' with different advantages and disadvantages. Outside of that, leveling is by 'Dice rolls' so it's random and a lot of times poor. It feels as if it's a clicking simulator that offers no depth. I hope things change, the game seemed to have some potential. Even the random 'love' interests and encounters is boring. Nothing that drives me to keep trying (outside of achievements)",

            "review_text": "The worst example of a hero raising VN that I can think of.  Almost every location is associated with a named, romancable character. Simply visiting that location and meeting them by chance will cause cheesy romantic music to start playing, give you two conversational choices to pick, likely improve your relationship score with them, and if you're lucky it might even increase a stat by a few points (of which you need a huge amount for it to even do anything).  Every few days you will tell your character to take time for herself, to restore her health and emotional state, so she can continue to work. The money from your work is then used to pay for your time off or lessons which may or may not increase your stats a little faster than working, any you don't spend is removed due to monthly taxes. You will continue to unavoidably be forced into romancing whichever NPC happens to be in the location you need for stat increases. Sometimes these romantic encounters are things such as saying hello to a stranger, or being yelled at by your boss. Yes, the stranger and the boss in these circumstances are the 'romances'.  The entire game is a grind like this, and if you wanted to pick a specific romantic partner, you better hope and pray that you knew what stats you had to train beforehand, otherwise you'll have extra hours of grinding just to start on their paths. While you can disable same-sex or opposite-sex romances to taste, this isn't an option given to you unless you go looking for it, and can be confusing when you find an abusive employer yelling at you to romantic music on your first few encounters.  This all might be forgiven if you're just thirsty for (presumably non-existent) trashy anime sex and got this game for a dollar, but currently this is selling for Â£15 at the time of this review. Even if there is a better game under the initial hours of grinding somewhere, that's still hours you're spending in utter boredom.  The only saving grace is the trading cards which you can use to regain some of your badly spent money. Only reccommended if you like buyers remorse :P",

            "review_text": "Recommended, but with strong reservations. I wish there was a choice between 'yes' and 'no'. I've played through twice, once as a download, once through Steam.  Pros: * It's a Princess Maker-alike raising sim, and there aren't enough of them. * Art is nice and clean, in an anime influenced Western style. * Lots of stats to raise * As many same-sex romantic endings as opposite sex * I enjoy the intital stats-setting quiz  Cons: * The work dice game is frankly horrible, * It doesn't provide the challenge of a good raising sim. Romantic endings are incredibly easy to achieve, and so are Goddess endings, even if you've spent the game up to that point chasing completely different stats * The Goddess eandings bear no relationship to what you've done in the game. My character was a builder, a smith, a dancer and a priestess, with teh title of Merchat--what in all that suggests that her true wish was to be a nature goddess? * Not enough achievements and, as far as I can see, endings. * Why does my noble born elf use such sloppy grammar? Why does she say she's just moved into town when she's lived there three years?  So, if you like riainsg sims, this is an attractive looking one and has the built in compulsiveness. I just wish there was more challenge, and more sense of controlling the PC's destiny. And oh, I loathe that dice game.",
