            "review_text": "A very canadian game about two lumberjack brothers who must protect their fevered sister from hordes of wolves send by the devil.  And then things get weird...  This game could be called a 'Strategic Trap Defense Game' in spite of 'Orcs Must Die!', only much more slow-paced. The gameplay is split in two parts:   1. The Strategy part: This is where you place your traps on a strategic map of the in-game location and take preperations for the night to come. The map shows you what enemies will appear, where they appear and which route they take. There's a variety of different weapons, items and accessoires you can buy in the shops that will help you to survive and you can change your loadout as you like. There are, of course, limitations in form of Action Points and Money. Every trap costs a different amount of Money and AP and once you run out of one (or both), you have to get along with what you prepared. There's also a Skill-Tree. Each time you level up you gain a skill point which can be used to further advance your traps or abilities in combat.   2. The Combat part: Where you fight enemies in a sort-of hack and slash manner and see how well your traps work. Lure the enemies in your traps and kill or weaken them and finish 'em off in close-combat. Your weapons of choice here are a axe and a musket, which has tremendous reloading time so you should reload it whenever you can catch a breath (you can speed it up by mashing the RMB but it still takes time). Naturally not all enemies will be killed by traps, especially since every trap only works once a night and the latter chapters have much stronger and more enemies, so get ready for some unfriendly close encouters. However, the game is never unfair and you can pretty much deal with anything as long as you're well prepared.  The graphics are done in a well-mannered and eye-pleasing cartoony style way. The sound works prefectly (no glitches or anything) and fits the aesthetics and the music is catchy as hell, especially the title tune is really addicting.  There are, however, some technical shortcomings I have to point out: 1. You can't change the settings in-game. You have to go back to the main menu, basically ending your game, to get to the options menu, which is a really poor developer decision even for a indie-game. 2. This is mostly a personal problem: Performance-wise it runs really unstable as long as V-Sync isn't active. Heavy frame-rate drops made the game run like a slideshow for me. Worst part is this really messed up my controls, I literally had to mash the mouse buttons so my character wouldn't just stand there like an idiot and letting himself get killed. Only after I enabled V-Sync the game would run acceptable for me. 3. No Window-Mode, but thats no real issue for me. Just pointing out in case someone wants to know.  Apart from those few problems it's a real fun game and if you like games like 'Orcs Must Die!' or are looking for a different kind of strategy game, this one might be for you.",

            "review_text": "Sang-Froid - Tales of Werewolves is an amazing little game that really forces you to use your brain; a great combination between a strategy (tower defense style) game and a role playing game. Would rate it at 8 out of 10.  Pros: - While it does have a linear path, it offers you with a lot of freedom on choosing the way you treat every quest (night), so it offers the possibility to replay it (dunno if really over and over again, but for sure for a few times) - Nice story, music and graphics (although cartoonish) that all contribuite to a nice immersion within the game - Offers both an easy and hard mode (plus any extra challenges you may set to yourself - like not use all action points or so), as well as optional strategy hints so it can fit a wide range of players (skillwise / smartwise)  Cons: - Rather limited content - is the kind of game you fall in love, play for a whole night or some solid hours during weekend and finish it; you can try to replay it a few more times, but ultimately is not the kind of game to keep you busy for months.  What I see this game great, even after you finished it and got bored of it, is as a distraction for guests (of any age) staying on your place for a few days and wanting to play something fun, but which doesn't requires a commitment / continuation. Could even see it as a group action where everyone colaborates with their thoughts on how to survive the night to come. :)",

The gameplay is a lot of fun and there's always something new waiting for you right around the corner ie a new gun, axe, trap or monster. The game's story is very interesting too with all the schemeing that goes on. The only parts i didn't like so much about this game were the graphics and voice acting. The graphics look nice but it seemed as if they couldn't decide whether to make the game look cartoony or realistic. It's hard to explain but it just sometimes seems weird to have a cartoony lumberjack next to such a detailed tree. The monsters look REALLY good though; i was actually getting scared at times when i'd see a werewolf's glowing eyes shining as he lunged towards me. The voice acting was a little awkward at times but it's no big deal. I did like the Devil's voice. All in all this is a great game and i'm glad to have bought it.",

You get down'n'dirty with the beasts, hacking at them with your ax and blasting them with your musket.  The graphics are decent enough for what the game tries to accomplish, and the voice acting is definitely on-par with even some AAA titles.   The only problem I've had so far with this game is the lip-syncing. It's not great.   However, other than that, this game is truly a diamond in the rough.  8.7/10",

Enough to pull you through if you enjoy the gameplay and give a reason for new enemies and objectives.

If you like strategy games, but also have that part of you that loves to smash through enemies in beat-em-up style, you're getting the best of both worlds with Sang-Froid. As I said above, it's a diamond in the rough, so not everything is seamless, though it's very close.  All in all, for $15 you're getting a lot more bang for your buck than the same old game that's been coming out the last 15 years and wants $60. ",

The opening music alone is worth the current sale price ($1.49-almost as much as a song on iTunes), although I'd recommend this game even without a discount. 1850s Canada is quite the refreshing setting, an unfamiliar time and place that only adds to the unfolding mystery.  Sang-Froid definitely has an indie feel to it-especially with the cutscenes-but the gameplay mechanics are intuitive and solid. I love the different stages in each level, from placing traps and planning a defense during the day to executing your plan come nightfall, for better or for worse. There's this sense of escalating urgency to the whole thing, as if there's just not enough time or resources to make it through to the next day.  In one instance I stood upwind from a pack and heard their howls as they caught and followed my scent. I snared an oncoming werewolf in a bear trap and crushed it to death with a quick shot to the overhanging rock pile I'd placed, then I frantically ran from its companions back to a bonfire by the cabin, rolling this way and that out of their clawing reach, barely able to light the fire before running out of stamina, and just able to frighten the beasts to catch a quick breather before axing them all to death in a ferocious back-and-forth dance around the fire-only to have to sprint right over to the next building in a panic to catch more of the werewolves before they could finish tearing everything to rubble.

You play as one of two brothers who are both good men at heart but somewhat troubled and not particularly liked by civilization. When your sister falls ill after being run out of town by a two-faced priest, the tiny cabin you hole up in becomes full of family turmoil and the epicentre of attacks by possessed wolves and more. Family woes aren't exactly put aside as monsters come night after night, giving a great feel for the brothers.  Gameplay is a merge of tower defence and third person action. During the day you go to town to buy booze, weapons, and gear and set up all sorts of traps from simple wolf traps to hanging nets of rocks to much more elaborate tools like spring-loaded spikes and ballistas. As is often the case, you unlock more and more goodies and more routes and more places to defend as you rely on a mix of trapping and just beating things with an axe or shooting a musket. Depending on how you spend your skills every level can also help out your preference of play.  So with a unique setting, variable gameplay, a great soundtrack, and enjoyment all round, if you remotely like tower defence and/or third person action, Sang-Froid is a must!",

            "review_text": "Since this is on sale, a short first impression: Sand-Froid has an intriguing storyline with nice athmosphere and music. The gameplay is divided into strategic planning (i.e. setting traps, managing money and action points) and fighting wolves with an axe and a front-loader rifle, ideally making strategic use of the traps you set in the previous phase. If strategy appeals to you, do not be afraid to play as Jack.  The game owes some of its mechanics to tower defense with a hero, but it transcends those in ways that give it much more flexibility and promise to make it much more interesting. That is mostly because the enemy waves have objectives and no fixed paths, and the player can influence them in various ways.   The game is fairly simple toget the hang of if you know to WASD your way around at night. I don't expect Sang-Froid to have the depth of a 'serious' strategy game because this game seems aimed at the discerning casual gamer, but I'm confident that however 'casual' the experience might turn out to be, it's going to be enjoyable.

        {
            "review_text": "Sang-froid is a great game, in concept! The translation of the idea into a videogame is also done well, mechanics-wise.  The big problem, for me, is how unpolished and frustrating the execution has been, especially for a 15€ game.  The game feels dated in almost every respect. Graphics, story-telling, how the combat and guns work, transitions, item system, etc. etc. Everything is very imperfect and takes way more time than it should. I don't want to make a full blown review, so I'll try to very briefly state the most glaring problems.  I've played the game twice. Once on Easy Mode, once on Hard Mode. Easy Mode was very uninteresting. Combat over strategy. Hard Mode was infuriating, since, while strategy was the focus, the combat was still very much required to a great degree, while your character was clearly very underpowered. As a result, almost every mission required multiple tries, even  after  I had the strategy laid and should have worked. I completely ignored the story and all of the other aspects aside from mechanics in the second playthrough.  Why? Because it's terrible. Honestly. The story is fairly cool, especially since I do like fairy-tale and folk stories, in general. The problem is how the story is delivered. It's... mind boggling to me. The story is told exclusively through 'cutscenes' that are merely characters talking to one another. Nothing fancy. The problems are: the writing isn't good, coupled with horrible voice-acting. I don't think the actors were in the same room at all. Each line feels completely disconnected from the situation at hand, and the tone is completely off. It just doesn't deliver. Then, there's the fact that, visually, they use some pretty bad 3D models, just because. The animations aren't all that great either. Nothing justifies the choice for these 'cutscenes'. A simple 2D conversation, with little animation and no voice-acting could have been much more polished without half of the work.  Not to mention that this had nothing to do with the game. Yet, it's one of the main elements of the product, and it sticks out like a sore thumb.  It's really, really, bad. I don't understand this choice at all. I could understand a sub-par execution, if it was a new idea, or something. This brings nothing new, nothing impressive. On the contrary, it's glaringly bad...  The game itself, for those of you not aware, is like Orcs Must Die, although the tower and combat phases are completely separated. First, you place the traps you can. Then, you fight each wave successively, with combat. That's fine, although it can be kind of annoying when you don't know exactly what will come at you (they tell you which enemies and where, but there are nuances...) and you have no chance to fix mistakes without restarting.  You'll get a plethora of different traps that you can later upgrade, but some of them are mostly useless or situational. Still, they fit the setting, and some combinations were fun to use.  You can also buy potions and weapons in the town. Potions are useless, except from the health ones. The others are burnt money, unless you're on the last missions. Why? Because you barely get any money to upgrade. So, why waste it on consumables?  You gain so little money that you'll take until the last few missions to be able to get a decent combination of weapons. Espcially on hard mode. Far too long.  The upgrade system is cool, although you can completely lock yourself if you use your points in the wrong place. You can 'undo', but only when you choose where to put them. If you 'confirm',you're stuck with them.   Ok, what's next? Graphically, it's a PS2 era game. If that. You can't see 7 meters in front of you, and I'm not sure if it's a design decision, or a performance choice. Then, the game suffers from fps problems when there are too many enemies active. And I have a 3.4Gz quad-core. There's no justification that I can think of, really.  The combat is extremely clunky. That could be fine, since you're not supposed to use it a lot. Except... that you need to, since traps are very limited. So except lots of restarts. The game has a lock-on system that will often change targets when you least want to. There are some enemies that will go underground to heal when they're low on HP. So, you want to kill them asap. The problem is: when there are several characters, the game may very well choose to target someone else. Well, crap...  The gun suffers a similar problem with the auto-aim. It 'snaps' to the closest target... sometimes. Sometimes it also seems to lag, and suddenly aims completely off, leading to a failed shot.   You also take a loooong time to reload, which is cool. Bullets are also fairly expensive, so the point is to hold on to them. Which is infuriating when the game throws your aim off!   Here's another thing: the game rewards you for using less traps. You can use Actions Points to cut trees, instead of placing traps. This further encourages combat, rather than strategy. Encourages the clunkiest system... And unbalances the game has a result, a bit. On Hard Mode, where you want to maximize traps, you end up getting way less money, making it even harder to upgrade, thus making the future missions even harder. There's a bit of a snowball effect, here... and not a good one.   Then, there are various other problems. The interface is big and full of boxes, and still manages to miss several very important aspects... You take far too long to navigate from the stores to the village and your home. It's the clicking, but there are way too many. There's also a lot of information missing, leading to even more time wasted... There's no plain restart button that starts you exactly at the level you were in. You always have to go to the strategy screen, and then click like 3 or 4 times to confirm textboxes before you go into the level. It doesn't help that there's always a load screen between transitions. So, except 2 loading screens every time you make a mistake and want to restart. Or simply die...   I realize this review is a bit toxic. I apologize for that. The game isn't terrible. The game itself, if I ignore everything else, can be fun and challenging, at times. The problem is that the game has way too many issues in too many different places, and it results in a very frustrating experience, overall. It tries to do a lot more than the game itself, but it doesn't know how. Seems like a lot of wasted work. I just can't understand the people claiming it to be a 'masterpiece'.  In concept, it's great. Execution... not really.   Orcs Must Die is a far more enjoyable game (both of them, in my opinion) and they provide more content than this, for a lower or equal price. And undoubtedly more finely tuned and polished.",

Too bad it refuses to run in full screen, no matter how much I play with the graphical settings of both the game and my computer. The icons render too itty bitty to read, and the game is essentially unplayable.   This is a apparently a problem with my monitor, in the sense that my monitor uses tech that is more advanced than what the game supports. But even when I scale my monitor's resolution down to 1024x768 and adjust the game's settings to match it, the game window just gets smaller and smaller. I get the best results keeping the monitor at 3200x1800 and running the game at 1900x1080, but even then it still takes up just a third of the screen. Probably a problem unique to my particular monitor, but unfortunate that I don't get to enjoy the game as intended, and I just wanted to put that out there as a potential warning, even if it is an unlikely one.

            "review_text": "Now, THIS is what I call a good game!  You see, a big part of a game can be decided by it's first impression. Some games do it wrong and plaster your face with 3rd party launchers past Steam and a ton of logos. When I started Sang-Froid, I was instantly welcomed with a plain loading screen accompanied by the single best intro theme I've heard in months, if not years. Not kidding, I was actually disappointed when the game finished loading and the song got cut off, so much I actually went and found myself the full into song online.  However, after the intro song + narration I was sure I had a neat game at my hands and I wasn't disappointed: Whilst the graphic and animations certainly aren't worthy of an AAA title (and there are a couple animation errors all across the game), they provide exactly the charme the intro already emitted. Overall, a really nice part of the game is it's atmosphere: You indeed feel like playing in the later colonial era, a time filled with issues of belief, mystic and tales. Except for the horrible facial models, everything the game shows and tells you feels really authentic.  Of course we are here to play a game though, not check on a visua novel, so how's the gameplay? Intriguing, to say the least. The early days start out really simple. Go there, shoot that wolf, axe those other wolves some questions. Quickly you learn that any enemy group with more then two enemies means certain death if you don't fight with a brain (and an eye on your stamina gauge). But as the day progresses, so does your equipment, your character and, of course, the enemies, both in quality and number. On daytime, you get the next bit of the story and place traps and other devices. As soon as the sun falls, you run around, trigger the traps and defend up to 5 locations at once. Impossible you say? A nice challenge, I say, given the game has a really fair difficulty curve (and an additional 'difficulty setting' in form of two character, with one being clearly weaker then the other and advertised as 'hard mode').  Overall, Sang-Froid is exactly the kind of great game I would wish every indie title would be. Though, there IS a little catch: The game has no replayability value. At best, you will go and play it twice, assuming you started with the easier character (I didn't, and are welcoming the difficulty. Albeit this cuts my potential playtime in half.) I'm currently 2/3rds through the game in mere 4 hours. This feels a tad short, especially if you got to consider the base 15€ price. I personally purchased it in the 90% off deal and therefore are HIGHLY pleased with the price-playtime ration.  Judgement: 9/10 (Can't give it a 10, even though not gamebreaking, those animation glitches ARE annoying at times) Must-buy if on sale and on 5€ or less.",

Also making the main character waeker than the enimies is a great idea it realy makes you think that if you have to use hand to hand combat (or in this instance, axe to claw) you have to use every thing you can to get an advantag, from using your musket, making an attmept with your axe, or even luring your enemies to a trap that hasent been used.   Also I love that you realy have to use anything to put distance between an army of werewolves and yourself and bonfires are the best to do so, because if you think that if just yur axe will get you through the night your are wrong.  And having the buildins to protect is a great idea it makes the night less about making sure that the character lives and more about making sure the builds survive.  All in all 'Sang Froid Tales Of Werewolves' one of the best stratagies/action games I have ever played. Hope they release a sequal, remeber this is tome 1. ",

This leads to an interesting metagame where some traps cost AP (action points), but also money. It becomes difficult to balance setting up enough traps to win, while saving enough money and AP(which can be converted to money) to get better gear so later levels are easier.

Now, I'm no stranger to the TD-genre, both the armchair general type where you just place towers/turrets/whatever down on a map to stop/kill the incoming enemies (Defence Grid or Plants VS Zombies), and the 'up close and personal' kind where you actually get to do some runnin' 'n' gunnin' yourself (Orcs Must Die! and Sanctum), but Sang-Froid isn't really either.   Taking enemies on in a head-to-head fight is to say the bloody least STU-PID unless they're just basic wolves and you're playing as Jos, AND WHY WOULDN'T YOU, SINCE HE'S APPARENTLY BETTER THAN WEAK-MODE JAQ IN EVERY SINGLE WAY!!! Anyway, where was I... oh, yeah. Sang-Froid's gameplay. It's an interesting enough concept, but the execution is like a wobbly, woinky... something. Basically, it's flawed as all FOCK! The music isn't BAD, but it's nowhere near GOOD either, and the cutscenes honestly look like they were made with cardboard cut-outs of the various characters, i.e. they're basically shïte.

            "review_text": "SNAPSHOT An action-RPG / tower defense game that looks like it was made by third graders. Thankfully, it plays like an 8th grade level.  OVERALL - 3.5 / 10  PROS + combat feels responsive + music is good + planning each level is interesting + relatively bug free (unless you're trying to get achievements, in which case the opposite of that)  CONS - awful models (texturing is ok at best) - awful voice acting - awful writing - way too many game mechanics overly complicates almost every portion of the game - replaying levels *intentionally* disincentivized - every level uses the same map for the entire game  DETAILS Where to even begin with this one. I really wanted to like Sang-Froid, I really did. Overall I like the concept of an action-RPG + tower defense game (Orcs Must Die! does it fairly well), and the movement in the game doesn't play all that poorly, but overall it is extremely poorly executed.  Probably my biggest gripe is that combat-related gameplay itself is just a pile-on of systems that's only purposes seem to be to limit what the player can do. First there is stamina, which is a combined limit of being able to run as well as your ability to use melee combat. Melee is frustratingly bad, especially the targeting. Often times you'll be attacking an enemy that's about to die and then suddenly the game will switch targets on you and you'll be swinging at something else on the other side of the screen, leaving that low health enemy free to do whatever it wants (which 90% of the time means regen to full or cast a meteor swarm down on your face). It becomes even MORE frustrating when enemies start becoming ~90% resistant to normal damage, so unless you have a weapon the enemy is weak to you won't be doing full damage. Ranged combat requires you to reload after every single shot you take, which takes an inordinate amount of time (there's an *achievement* for reloading in under 3 seconds). You can speed up reloading slightly by mashing a button, which seems to only distract the player from how long it actually takes. Also of note for ranged combat is that it has headshot and non-headshot hitboxes that 'lock on' (poorly) that are infuriating more often than not. Next, there's a 'fear' system that was supposed to help players not fight enemies all the time, but in practice way too complicated and cumbersome. On top of all of this there are still traps for players to place, each of which only has *one* use per level (seriously?) per trap placed.  Paired with this combat system is ~ 3 different enemies (there's one ranged enemy in the game, and then a few minor variations of a melee enemy) and *one* map that goes through extremely minor changes and expands slightly between levels. Also of note are the 'two' characters to choose from, which in reality only vary in starting stats so I'm still not sure why the choice even exists. If there had been half as much time / effort put in to adding all the limiting factors in combat and 4x as much time put into adding real variations in content, it would have potentially been a much more engaging game. Unfortunately, while it seems all of the development efforts were spent in adding combat systems, combat gets old very quickly without a change in enemies to face. The different starting points and number of enemies each wave helps masks this problem slightly, but that wears thin pretty quickly.  On top of all of this, replaying levels is almost completely out of the question. You CAN go back to a level you've already completed, however it erases ALL progress past that point. There is one achievement for completing the game for each character, but why anyone would do that is beyond me. The game doesn't play differently for either character, save for the fact that one of them has less health AND stamina than the other. Skill points that are awarded each time a player levels up only seem to annoy a player more than help them, most of which only add minor amounts of damage. The skill points spent almost never make a difference in whether or not an enemy dies; either the damage added is already overkill, or it adds such a minimal amount that you're better off walking up and meleeing them instead.  Easily the worst parts of the game are the 'animated cutscenes' between levels. I could forgive the awful models if there were a lot of them (or if this game was made in 2006), but there are comically few to be seen and it was released in 2013. It is very apparent that the entirety of the modeling / animation efforts in the game were spent on the cutscenes, which there are unfortunately ~1-3 of every single level. The voice acting is as cringe-worthy as the models, and the writing is almost as bad. Given that the story is based on French Canadian folklore, however, that means 90% of the work was already done story-wise, so how that was screwed up so poorly I'll never know.  Overall, this game has a lot of things in place to distract players from the fact that just about every system was poorly planned and designed, so if you're really into shiny things feel free to pick it up. If you're not easily fooled, however, stay as far away as you can.",

            "review_text": "Written by Canadian author Bryan Perro and produced by Artifice Studio, Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves is best described as a strategy game with action elements. You begin the game as one of two feuding brothers. One remains in the cabin with your sick sister, while the brother you select to play, is responsible for protecting the homestead from the increasing waves and ferocity of wolves, supernatural and mythical beasties, which appear when night arrives. Your aim is simple – survive the night.  To achieve this, you set traps, fire your musket and swing your trusty axe. As the game progresses, you learn new traps and are able to upgrade your equipment by visiting the nearby town or Indian reservation. This includes blessing your axe and bullets in order that they may be more effective against certain beasts.   The story of this game unfolds during each day that takes place after you’ve survived a night. It’s a simple, but effective tale of omens, superstition, possession, greed and lust. It explores a conflict between good and evil that overtakes a small Canadian town and nearby forest. The voice acting is solid - I loved the Mayor’s confession – plus, I found the tale to be well scripted. I also loved how the story was presented. It’s a 2D affair using striking cartoon characters, beautifully rendered with strong colours and decisive design.   I found the gameplay straightforward. You begin with a map of the area that will be affected during the night by the next attack of supernatural forces. These are shown in waves. You are able to see the starting point of each group of wolves, werewolves etc., and can access details of the route to the building they will attack. This information allows you to plan your defence and place traps in the places where they will be most effective. You also plan how to use bait and scent to lure the beasts, plus traps can be combined to devastating effect. However, some beasts will escape, evade or be only partially damaged by your traps, which is where sharpshooting and your axe come into play. Once a night is set in motion, the game is in third person 3D.  Character development uses an RPG style skill tree. Here you improve your characters performance, the strength of your traps, the ferocity of your axe and length of your bonfires. You can also increase your intimidation, or fear, factor which is surprisingly useful. As stamina plays a major role in how much you can do, being able to intimidate means you gain recovery time. Yes, you can role and manoeuvre away from a beast, but this does deplete your stamina. In addition, if surrounded by a pack of wolves there is only so much manoeuvring you can do. Naturally stamina is an aspect of your character’s performance you can improve, but hard choices have to be made.  Sang-Froid: Tales of Werewolves drew me in, engaged me, delighted me and was an incredibly satisfying experience. The first three nights are instructional; the ones which follow gradually step the game up a gear, until what appeared to be a straightforward scenario becomes pretty darn complex. You don’t know if your strategy will succeed until you survive the night but, when your chosen brother steps out into the pool of light surrounding the homestead and you find yourself poised, ready to go, with your traps set and your plan for the first wave firmly implanted in your mind, you’ll know the game has entrapped you.

            "review_text": "Misleading is the best summary I can give. From the trailer, it looked like a great hack and slash with tactical planning, but ended up having Rainbow Six bloopers where if you don't do everything perfectly, you are screwed.  The graphics are pretty good. They remind me of a launch title for the PS2. I don't like how little I can adjust the graphics and because of the lowest settings available, it isn't fluid for frame rates (I hover around 40 instead of the preferred 60). I can't even adjust the resolution outside of my monitor (16:10), so I'm forced to 1244x800 instead of picking something lower when there are options to select lower.  The reaction times for attack animations are a bit off. The stamina bar affects attack speed, but creatures like the werewolf tended to almost blink towards me like a flash step and I couldn't swing to counter attack in time. Things like that prevent a lot tactical fighting, especially when certain creatures like the Were-wolf are too fast to run away from and you'll pretty much die if you don't strike first with a trap.  Sound effects are passable. I wanted to listen to my own music fairly quickly, but the intro song alone was pretty good while it took two full minutes to load on a fairly modern machine. (made in 2011 with the latest parts at the time).  All together it is frustrating to the point I don't want to spend too much time replaying levels because of the inability for the characters to be useful. It is Rainbow Six all over again and the old Rainbox Six games were cool atmosphere but quit-inducing rage sessions due to bad AI and weird decisions from the Devs for gameplay, just like this game.",

Would i recomend it? YES! and i very much hope the developers will relsease an expansion / DLC with more maps, more characters, more weapons as the gameplay is very fun and is the true highlight og the game. ",

Main goal of the game is to defend various buildings of importance from the attacks of wolves and werewolves during the night by setting up traps during the day. Selection and placement of traps is incredibly important, it's almost like a puzzle game. Game doesn't force you solve every puzzle perfectly though. When things don't go the way you hoped you can always let your axe do some of the work. You can also customize your character with unlockable skills and items which opens up different solutions.  Story is rather interesting, presented almost as a graphic novel. Really nice soundtrack and probably the best musket action I've seen in a game. What's also worth noting is how well the enemies and combat are balanced. You won't be facing generic tower defense creeps which die by the dozens when you sneeze at them. Game really makes you respect the enemies here as even a single werewolf can make you sweat if you mess up your traps.  Overall, anyone who's into one of either strategy, tower defense, puzzle or resource management will really enjoy this game.",

Games like Orcs Must Die and Sanctum seem to lead the pack in this realm but Sang-Froid has emerged to be my favorite of this style of game. First off, I love the aesthetic of the game. The frozen Canadian frontier in December during the 1800s really appealed to me. Couple this with the werewolf and Native American lore and I was hooked. There is story here. The voice acting and animation definitely show it's indie roots (meaning not that great) but unlike other games of this ilk, I actually paid attention to the narrative.   Gameplay wise, strategy is key. Know where to place your traps and what kind of traps to use is crucial. The planning phase of this game ended up being more instrumental to me than any other tower defense game. It was extremely satisfying during missions to here a trap go off somewhere in the distance and know I had a kill. The combat might be the weakest part of this game. You could say it was 'challenging' but at times it just seemed clumsy. I would often swing my ax at an enemy and get caught in a combat animation that would leave me vulnerable. I don't know if this was intentional but it felt frustrating at times. However, when it worked, I enjoyed it.  Overall: Pros: Decent story, good atmosphere, great strategy, interesting enemies. Cons: Clumsy combat, somewhat stiff voice acting.  I would reccommend this game. Extra reccommendation: play it in the winter when there is snow on the ground outside if you can. This definetly added to my enjoyment of the game.",

            "review_text": "Now here's a game that caught me by surprise. Sang Froid: Tales of Werewolves is Montreal-based Artifice Studio's first title, and in spite of some general shabbiness in its presentation, they've done enough things right here that I'll be keeping an eye out for their future releases.  In Sang Froid, you play a pair of Canadian woodsman brothers, defending their sister (as well as the surrounding community) from nightly assaults by supernatural forces both Christian and Pagan in nature. Gameplay takes the form of an innovative and wonderfully executed combination of chop-em-up action, clever tower defense, and Rainbow Six-style tactical planning. Each day presents you with a chunk of storyline, and then lets you spend your limited daylight hours setting up traps on your property or logging at the local lumber yard for extra cash (which is spent on weapons, items, and some of the more dramatic and powerful trap-types). Thanks to your psychic sister, you know ahead of time what kinds of enemies will be attacking, where they'll come from, and what they intend to destroy; setting appropriate traps for each situation is crucial to survival, as you can only be in one place at a time, and your combat prowess is hardly a match for a single werewolf, let alone a pack of several.  When night falls, the assault begins and you get to see if your defenses hold up. Armed with an axe, a rifle, and whatever consumables you've brought with you, you must do everything in your power to wipe out the assaulting units. At its simplest, you can engage opponents in melee, killing off opponents that you either hadn't set traps for or which manage to survive whatever you'd prepared. While the controls are a little wobbly at times, the combat options are innovative, simple, and very intelligent. When you aren't out busting skulls, however, your job will be to run from trap to trap, activating them at the right time to deal the most damage, or letting the enemy catch your scent and then luring them to their fiery/spiky/bouldery doom. Several enemies are very resilient to your weapon attacks, and without intelligent use of traps they can be nearly unbeatable in hand-to-hand combat. You can get around this by wielding blessed or silver weaponry, but you can only carry one axe at a time, and you can't have it both ways.  I haven't had this much fun with a game in a long, long time. All the trap varieties are useful in their own way, adding interesting layers to the strategy. Plotting out the most effective and efficient layout to take out enemies is a bit intimidating at first, but quickly becomes very satisfying; there's nothing quite like knowing you've set up a fool-proof murder gauntlet and then seeing it work like a charm. Running through the woods, sneaking up on your prey as it munches on the bait you've left out; or ziplining over the forest to engage a band of demons at precisely the right moment... Each night's encounter is demanding enough to make you work for it, and all the elements involved in pulling it off are simply fun. Based purely on the gameplay, Sang Froid is an easy title to recommend.  It does have a few weaknesses though. The game suffers beneath an occasionally stuttery framerate, no-budget cutscenes, fairly basic character models, a script that's difficult to take seriously, and a voice acting cast made up of amateurs (several of whom likely have English as a second language). This is more than counterbalanced by a gorgeous musical score, an unorthodox and inventive setting that drowns out the actual writing, and the stellar gameply mentioned above. If it weren't for the fact that nobody seems to know it exists, I'd say Sang Froid has all the makings of a truly great cult classic.",

I grew up in minnesota, so when I saw werewolves, and canadian foklore, and RTS AND action...I hit the purchase button faster than a Wendigo sneezes ice. It has a great folky soundtrack, and great hand-drawn visuals, especially the menu and town interfaces.   Being that it is indeed an indie game, the game budgets and amount of people working on this title would be laughable to a mega-corp like Ubisoft or the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly EA. So there are a few expected rough areas, but they don't detract from the overall game. Mainly, the voice acting was terrible, I felt like random people off the street were pulled in to read children’s books to 1rst graders. If they every make a TOME II, it would be great if they addressed this. Conversely, the sounds while playing the game and the music are very well done. It really sends a shiver up your spine playing this in your room at night, the sounds of the wind rushing through trees, the crack of branches and snarls and howls of the beasts just over the hill expertly done to always create the feeling you will be attacked at any moment.   Mechanically the game works pretty smooth, and is challenging to say the least. It creates tense and relentless action when you hit the go button; it actually is scary in a way. There is a sense of dread and nervousness as you hover your mouse over the ‘begin’ button…setting in motion the nights terrors upon you. You hope things will work out and you will survive, but it always feels as if the odds are stacked against you. My one complaint is the pacing...the skill tree becoming unlocked only started to open up toward the end, and by the time I could really afford some better weapons, there were only a couple missions left. I wish there was a patch to adjust this a bit. I love a challenge, but I hate seeing cool things that I can't afford and can't have fun using, then it’s over. When it was over though, I can say it was definitely a sense of accomplishment! This makes me want to go back now, play with the harder brother and see if I can get those last few achievements, which are not just filler achievements.  Overall, for a couple bucks, this game is well worth it, is unique, and hope to see their next game...though it looks vastly different in theme. A great 'first' game for this small team in Canada!

I have played no other games in this genre, but many compare it to the Orcs Must Die series. This game combines elements of FPS, tower defense, and RPG wrapped in a beautiful package inspired by obscure history and folklore. Combining Quebecois and indigenous folkloric elements in a mid-nineteenth century milieu, there is no setting like it. This is very refreshing in a culture industry where 'generic high fantasy' is now ubiquitous and passe, often falling back on Tolkien without understanding what makes his oeuvre magisterial and immortal. Some have criticized the voice acting for a lack of polish, but it has a heartfelt community theater style that charms, entertains, and fits this project. The stakes and tension in the story grow steadily to fever pitch, and the cliffhanger left me wanting more immediately. There are several mechanics and ways to play, so you can experiment with different styles-guns, potions, traps, magic-in each playthrough. The tight time and resource management in some missions and the overall arc heightened the sense of excitement and urgency and the need to engineer a perfect defensive strategy. I preordered it for $13.49 years ago and still believe it would be worthwhile at even twice the price. It is just that fun and unique. The only real criticism I have is that the game is not well optimized and is slow to load initially, but I think it is a triumph when considering the time and resources available to such a small team.  I very much hope more attention and sales give the developers the wherewithal to forge ahead and make the sequel this game so richly deserves.",
