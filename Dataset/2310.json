            "review_text": "Quake's 20th anniversary is here and I started playing the singleplayer campaign again. I played Quake when it originally released and it still holds up today. Quake's legacy might be its multiplayer, but Quake 1's campaign is great. It's all about the creepy atmosphere. It's not a game where you quickly mow through legions of demonic creatures. It involves exploration and some minor puzzle solving (mostly just finding keys or pressing a panel to open a wall, etc). You're wandering around a dark, subterranean castle-like environment which is in stark contrast to the sci fi settings of the sequels. This is by far the best setting out of the Quake series and I wish they'd do a modern take on the original setting, instead of all the sci fi Strogg nonsense that came after it. None of them captured the eerie horror setting and atmosphere of the original which is a shame. There is a basic story and lore to the game you can read about, but its not really presented in the game. You don't need to read anything to enjoy the game though. Similar to how Doom had a basic plot, but the game itself just involves you navigating levels and shooting stuff.  You must play this game with the Ultimate Quake Patch installed. It restores Trent Reznor's (of Nine Inch Nails) original soundtrack which was a creepy atmospheric masterpiece. To play the game without it is doing yourself a serious disservice. In addition to the soundtrack, it adds support for new resolutions. I personally don't think it needs any high res texture pack, playing it at a higher screen resolution is enough. It might look primitive by today's standards but id Software did a superb job with the limitations they had at the time.  Multiplayer is all but dead. While servers still exist, good luck finding anybody to play with. I had loads of fun with the multiplayer when the game was new, the Headhunters mod was particularly entertaining. You're not going to be playing this game today for the multiplayer, but for its singleplayer where it really shines.",

It shows where 3 dimensional first person shooters came from. Yes, one can argue that the genre started with games such as Wolfenstein, Doom, or even Duke 3D... But fully 3D enemies and environments started here. Back when video cards were first starting to hit the market and everything was still being done on the CPU.  The CPU utilization of the game becomes apparent when you notice just how bad the animations truly are. You'll first notice it with the dogs and the fact that their legs don't even have a full loop and they simply look silly when they run. This is a very minor detail when you consider the game's mechanics.  The motion of the player is smooth and the guns shoot as you'd expect by today's standards. This game set a standard that was long followed up until regenerative life was put into games. I am hoping that the Doom reboot successfully brings the arena shooter genre back. I appreciate a good story but the action in games of this caliber can make up for all that side ♥♥♥♥. Let's face it, running around with a rocket launcher as your main weapon and blowing everything up is good for your stress and all kinds of fun at the same time.",

            "review_text": "Quake, along with Doom and Doom 2, is one of the best FPS games in existence. If you liked Doom and/or have grown tired of modern military FPS games, and haven't played Quake before, then I think you really should give Quake a shot. It's a great game. (You can skip Quake 2 and not really miss much).     The game is fast and fluid, it has the best grenade 'tinkle sound' in any game, the best jump/hump sound in existence, and the guns, like Doom, are in 'the middle', so the avatar feels like some kind of supernatural tank. Unlike a lot of contemporary 'Early 3D' games that look like complete ♥♥♥ due to the low level of polygons, I think Quake still manages to pull it off it's look. (Though only if you play it in non-GL mode. Bilinear filtering on tiny textures looks terrible, and is one of the main reasons early 3D games (e.g. Sin) look so bad). I really like the light/shadow of the levels and the particle effects, though the levels are a bit on the brown side, admittedly.  All of the levels are weird and abstract, and don't just look like the crate storage rooms used in Quake 2 and every game since then. The low poly, highly angular level geometry helps this as well. Some of them (e.g. episode 2?) are even weird checker-board castles and such. There's also a lot of up/down movement in those levels, with the famous concept of speed running being possible by a few well placed explosions giving the player the ability to bypass huge amounts of level if they're skilled or completely lucky. There's definitely still an 'explorable' mental-map-forming aspect to a lot of the maps, much like Doom, (though it lacks an automap) and this allows the maps to contain secrets and easter eggs, something I really miss in later games. Most of all there's no attempt at cutscenes or 'story' or anything. It's like Doom in that it's pretty much pure-play. (Actually, there might be a few camera changes in the game that kind of look a bit like cutscenes?). Quake is a very non-modal game, as everything is done in that first person view. Even the choice of difficulty and a episode is performed in-game by running through portals.  I'd like to think that the reason I like Quake 1 isn't rose-tinted nostalgia, as I actually never played Quake at the time of release, but only long after I'd played Quake 2 and Half-Life. I've not played Quake as much as Doom1/2, so the initial Quake levels don't fill me with as much dread/boredom as the early Doom levels. (I've played Doom/2 practically from their time of release). Quake also isn't just a boring tech-demo, like Unreal or Quake 2 (which I also played at the contemporary time), but is fun from the first second of being in-game.   If someone liked Doom and has grown tired of modern military FPS games, and hasn't played Quake before, then I think they they really should give Quake a shot. It's a great game. (You can skip Quake 2 and not really miss much).   Overall: Quake is great!",

Gameplay - Let's trim the fat and get right to the guts right off the bat; Quake's gameplay is that of your typical 90's old-school FPS: Fast, bloody, complex and hard as hell, and you will love it (if you're into FPS games, that is). You get a wide array of weapons from a harmless Axe to the dreaded Thunderbolt, which turns any enemy into mincemeat in seconds, including the dreaded Shambler. Also like any old-school FPS, it is rife with secret areas that are a chore to find, but well worth the rewards within! Most times, at least. Tons of pick ups like the Pentagram of Protection (Invulnerability), Ring of Shadows (Invisibility), and the all-too-memorable Quad Damage, allowing you to unleash doomsday to every enemy in sight -- and yourself, too, if you aren't careful! -- dealing a massive 400% damage with any weapon you choose! There is a wide variety of enemies you will also encounter, from the annoying Grunt to the creepy Vore. Hint: When you see a Fiend (the bipedal, ape-like thing with lacerator arms) run like hell. One leap attack, and you're near dead. No joke.  2. Graphics - Usually graphics aren't one thing to take too seriously in reviews. In my philosophy, so long as you can see where you are going, and nothing looks TOO pixelated, they're perfectly tolerable. Buuuuuuuuut, that being said, download the Ultimate Quake Patch to be able to play this game in buttery-smooth 1920x1080 (if you have a full HD monitor that is). Never before has a game from the 90's looked so crisp and clear. And to think at one point I thought the 320x240 resolution of Quake on the N64 was the best thing ever. *shudders*  3. Difficulty - Hoo, boy...if you are brave enough to play this game on Nightmare (which you should to get the full experience, as cliche as that may sound, I know), this game will keep you on the edge of your seat nearly at all times, especially once you start encountering the bigger, badder enemies in later levels. Also, beware the Spawns (the bouncy slime-things). Just...just trust me on this.  4. Replay value - I could start this beauty up and play it any day of the week and have fun with it. It's fast-paced, bloody FPS action at its finest, and one of the true granddaddies of the FPS genre, along with Doom, Wolfenstein 3D and Duke Nukem 3D.  Bottom Line: You want this game. It's usually like, $3 or something. Absolute steal and a half. As are the expansions! But I'll review those by themselves.",

Games like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Team Fortress Classic, and most importantly, this game. Quake is one of my favorite games of all time, and a top contender for my favorite first person shooter. If you are a gamer that enjoys reloading constantly, passively regenerating health, being guided linearly from point A to point B in the story, and generally playing behind a safety net, then good for you. But Quake is a fast paced, old school, top of the class shooter that refuses to hold your hand. The fast paced gameplay, the need for exploration to find every secret to help you through, the challenging, hard hitting enemies and weapons, and the fact that you can die extremely quickly if you screw up. That is what a good shooter is to me, and I can't think of a better example of where that shines than Quake. If you haven't played this game before, I can't recommend it enough, and if you're a long time fan of the Quake series like me, then you understand why I feel the way I do about this game. 10/10.",

The soundtrack is very fitting with the atmosphere that is placed around and creates a sense of immersion. The story is not clearly explained and is not emotional or anything but compelling enough to keep you blasting through enemies and exploring the environment. The gameplay is what to be expected, a fantasically crafted simple yet enjoyable first person shooter that screams everything is classic about this game. I would recommend this game to anyone in the world, even if they do not play video games often. This is a must play for anyone and everyone, this fine piece of gaming history should be known to all.    Quake is not just a game, but a whole culture that has culminated a certain part of video game history that still stands today in 2016. As one of my favorite games, even today, I can recommend this game to anyone. The graphics are not the absolute best, but were still revolutionary at the time. The sound is nostalgic to all of those that stayed up late nights playing with their friends blasting eachother with the crazy fun arsenal of weapnry. The environments took you to places that were quite unique for the time and somehow made sense to be designed the way that they were and not only that, but enjoyable to the average gamer. Furthermore, I think if the graphics get to you now, there are still modders that have improved on that to either get new players to experience it or bring some older players a new experience.",

Quake itself wasn't quite all the gaming public had hoped for back in the mid 90s. The music, visual design and action seemed quite dull compared to the hell-ride that was Doom, whilst the 'full 3D levels' didn't seem to impress as much with competition from console games such as Super Mario 64 and Tomb Raider - which both offered smooth character animations where Quake's creatures-from-the-abyss were very jerky...  That said, this game still manages to be a mile stone in gaming history. Its multiplayer culture was massive back in the day and for years to come, and somehow, there is a gritty and creepy menace to the games characters - the jerky animation is actually a strength in this regard. While Doom was Id's finest hour, Quake is still a highlight for the Texas-based developer. Go grab a horror/action soundtrack CD from an old film and set it running before loading up Quake, and you'll be pleasantly surprised how delightfully nasty this classic game can be...

Its stood the test of time and influenced my gaming like no other. Great single player, great sounds, great atmospheric sound/music, great multiplayer, great mods, etc.  if you ever want to experience what gave us gaming today, play this and its two Expansion Packs.",

            "review_text": "Quake is one of those games that, despite its flaws, has stood the test of time like few others. id made an incredible job of using their limitations to their advantage. The combat is much more close quarters than his cousin Doom due to polycount restrictions, resulting in a much more oppresive experience and tactical interplay between enemy and level design that keeps the game varied without any need for character progression. The monochrome palette flourishes in its lower Middle Age / Lovecraftian setting, evoking a sense of gloom and pestilence that never allows you to be comfortable in any place. Even the dated visuals add to a sense of charm.  PROS: A precious blend of atmosphere and fast-paced combat and pure unadulterated fun, stuffed with secrets and power-ups in the best 1990s game tradition.  CONS: The mouse controls are the part that has stood worst the test of time, and would really benefit from a revamp (can be modded though). If you can't use 3D acceleration, the highest resolutions run the game at truly unplayable framerates.  8/10  Buy it whether you played in its day or not, for a timeless piece of History.  If one game needs a Doom-like reboot by id Software, is this one.",

            "review_text": "Doom for its time was an extreamly great game and still widely played today, in my opinion Quake shares that throne, the throne made of pure gold and big enough to seat 3 important FPS franchises by one developer, and WAY too heavy to be stolen even if every single other franchise tried at once with a heavy duty constuction crane (you know those big ones they use to build big apartment buildings?).  The third important FPS is wolfenstine, but that is for another review.  In quake you play as a person whos name I have forgoten (if he even has a name, i don't know a lot about the lore) andhave to go through 4 episodes of ancient castles and fortresses in order to collect 4 ancient runes needed to banish a horible evil entity known as shub-niggurath a huge monster and the only way to defeat it, is telefraging it.  Not only was quake one of the first TRUE 3D FPS's it's also the start of the team fortress franchise, that's right you know the original rocket launcher for the solider? it's actually the rocket launcher from this very game.  When starting it's pretty unique i'm not going to spoile it but, you might like it.  The enemies are distinct from each other you got the knights who rush you with a sword, you got the flying monster (whos name i forgot) and then you got the ogre (no not shrek) who can just ♥♥♥♥ off and the blob monster in the last episode can get double f**ked on a pile of spikes because it hops around so damn fast you can barly hit it, these are all enemies you love to hate.  anyway i'm not going to waste anymore of your time play this game or look for other reviews on steam or on youtube.",
