I like that its origional and it has a kind of 'hitchhikers guide to the galaxy' feel about it.   + Fun strategic battles + Origional  + Good variety so far  - Interface can be a bit clunky at times - Takes a little while to get properly going  Overall fun, interesting and recommended     ",

            "review_text": "Ehh. Nothing really interesting. A game from the 80s with some graphics updates. Sure, I guess it uses some basic relativistic equations (Lorentz transform seems to be used) but the game mechanic doesn't really have much to do with relativity at all. It's just shooting ♥♥♥♥ in space and building things.",
