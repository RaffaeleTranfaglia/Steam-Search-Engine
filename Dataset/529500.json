            "review_text": "Personally I don't see what all the negative hype is with this game. I took a chance and got it myself because I'm a huge fan of horror and VR. This game was great. I really enjoyed it and can't wait to show it off to my friends and family. In my opinion the price tag is worth it for the entertainment I will be getting from show casing this game to others. During my own time playing it there where moments of suspense and terror that gave me the quick shock and even goosebumps. If you're a fan of VR and horror together give this game a shot. The locomotion take a little time to get used to but once you've adapted and get used to it, the game is a fun play through. I hope this helps those who are reconsidering the purchase due to its 'mixed' reviews.",

            "review_text": "This game has several things that work in it's favor, but overall it has more things going against it that quickly made this game become stale and uninteresting.  Pros:  I do like how the game has a 'free roaming' style allowing you to venture around the house. Definitely makes you feel more in control of the experience. Lighting is perfect and keeps you on your toes. Graphics aren't half bad; not great, but not terrible.  Negatives: Jump scares were predicatble and cheesy. Within the first 5 mintues the same scare tatic of a picture flying off the wall was used twice. First time, you got me good. Second time within minutes, c'mon now don't fall back on the same gimmicks. A horror game needs to have a foundation built on an increasingly intense and creepy atmosphere, without it the game either gets off on the wrong foot and doesn't succeed or it doesn't become innovative as it progresses and dies off. Alone VR fell victim to the latter. Eventually the veil was lifted and I could see the cheap jump scares coming from a mile away, resulting in me becoming quickly bored of the game.  Alone VR has potential to become great, but at it's current $15 price point I can't find a strong reason to justify spending that amount of money based on the quality of the experience I've had thus far.",
