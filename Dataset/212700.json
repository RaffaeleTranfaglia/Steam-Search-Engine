            "review_text": "This game is a tricky one to review - I love the core ideas of the game, but not the execution in many ways. You control the 7 deadly sins in a 2D platformer most similar to Trine. In fact, you can argue that a lot of this game is inspired from Trine. Switching between heroes, combat, puzzles (sometimes usiing physics), and even the floaty controls are all reminiscent of Trine.  First of, I adore the concept of the game. All seven of the deadly sins look and feel like what they are representing and each of the powers of the sins fits in well, the perhaps the exception of Envy, who supermans it up and shoots a freaking laser from her eyes. I was not aware that was a thing with Envy. However, you can tell what each character represents well and, on top of that, the game introduces you to them one by one and allows you to use their powers.  I see this game as three different parts: the platforming part, the combat part, and the puzzle part. As a platformer, this game is decent. Its not terrible, but there are far better platforming games to play rather than this one. Honestly, its rather basic with not much experimentation. Nothing broken, but nothing amazing as well.  The combat part is really rough. Although each of the sins have a visually different basic attack, they all feel too similar to make in impact. In fact, I am not sure if there even was a difference. Combat is also affected by the sins; unique powers, but too often combat was too frantic to make meaningful options. I could use Sloth to slow them down, switch to Lust to charm the other, and dash in using Pride... or I can use Gluttony to one shot them and regain health, melee another while healing all the damage, and one shot the other. Why bother switching sins when Gluttony is so much better. This is the biggest issue with the game, unless I am forced to switch, I generally stuck to Gluttony for combat and Greed, with his huge hookshot, to platform and start fights. The rest waited their turn for their needed role in the puzzles spread throughout.  Which, by the way, is by far the best aspect of the game. The puzzles are well designed and tricky and had elements from across the board. Sometimes you ran across a physics puzzle, sometimes a simple mirror-reflection puzzle, sometimes a timing and precision puzzle. This is where the game shined, the sins need to work in tandem and that gave me the most satisfaction when playing.  As I said, this game is hard to review since this game is all over the place, however, given its price and inclusion in indie bundles, I will give it a recommendation. Play it if it is in your library, you can easily beat it in a play session or two.",

            "review_text": "The poorest man's Trine. If were any poorer, you wouldn't be able to pay attention.   The platforming is as boring as it gets, combat (somehow) even more so. The graphics are poor and the cut scenes are drawn according to the 'highest' standart of web comics. Sound bites from the characters are poor, boring and repetative, especially when you factor in the constant need to switch them. Goes double for some of the more obnoxious puzzles.   Also, purgatory is, for some reason, a land of conveyor belts, gears and boxes. It's as puzzling a decision as buying this game.",

The game mechanics are the same as in Trine, except you control 7 characters instead of just 3 and the graphics are not as fancy.  You can swap instantly from one character (sin) to another at any time using hotkeys (1, 2, 3, 4, Q, E and R by default). Each character has unique abilities to use both on combat and to solve puzzles: Gluttony can eat enemies to regenerate HP but can also swallow blocks to carry them around. Sloth can slow down any enemy or objects alike. Greed can use his hook to grab items or bring enemies to close range. Pride has a big sword to use in close combat or to reflect projectiles while Envy has a long range ray to burn enemies or light torches, etc.  The levels have a nice balance of combat and puzzles.",

            "review_text": "Recommended is perhaps a bit strong but I had fun with this. It is a Trine-like puzzle platformer and if you're a fan of that sub-genre then there is some value here but don't expect it to match up to Trine's level of polish. This is very much amateur hour by comparison.   Parts of it are definitely misguided. Particularly the boss battles which just aren't fun, interesting or exciting. The combat is also hilariously unbalanced. Envy has a beam attack that you can fire constantly and can shred anything at range and Gluttony has a move that swallows an enemy whole and recharges his health while digesting it which basically makes him a tank that wanders about the battle field almost impervious to most normal attacks occasionally swallowing people. Everyone else is basically useless outside of the puzzles and (later in the game) for breaking the colour coded enemy shields. The basic problem is that character roster is too bloated. If they'd dropped one of the powers and given two each to three characters then it would have been a better game. They'd have had to drop the seven deadly sins thing of course but honestly, I'd struggling to see that as a bad thing. Like most high concept ideas it turns out to be nothing more than a paper thin conceit once stretched out to fit over a complete creative work.",

It didn't even took me long to notice the bad taste that i hat on my tong wen i played with the game around. you have 7 guys with different ability and for many jobs you need that 1 guys/ability? the would environment screamed at you that you need for this puzzle that ability? fight animation like a flash game made by one guy? really? REALLY? it just was so **** boring that i didn't feel like experiment around. it was more like finding the Right key from 7 every time, not something interesting to try for you. try Trine/Trine 2 and skip that one.",
