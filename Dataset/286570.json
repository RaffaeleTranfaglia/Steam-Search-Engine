            "review_text": "So far I have been left with a bitter taste in my mouth and cannot recommend this game... yet.  Pros: The graphics and optimisation. I have a FX-8320 and a GTX 970. I'm getting 60+ FPS with the whole grid on ultra. The handling model. I have a G27 and I am happy with the FFB and the physics have vastly improved, especially compared to F1 2014.  Cons: No safety car. I don't know Codemasters reasoning for this but I personally feel it takes away from the game. This game crashes more than Maldonado. Ran a benchmark, crashed. Tried online, crashed. Started pro season mode, crashed. You get the idea. Littered with bugs. For now there is only one that I find truly game breaking. When I play Pro season mode, (for those who dont know, it is supposed to turn off all HUD and assists and locks you into cockpit cam) I still have all the assists on and since the menu is greyed out I can't manually turn them off.  I would advise anybody interested in this game, to be patient and wait for future fixes and then consider a purchase.  May update this in the future. 10/07/15 ------------------------------------------------------------ 24 hours of game time later I feel it is time to update my review.  First off, since my first review they released a 2nd patch on the day of release, which is pathetic that it was even needed in the first place as it wasnt even a large one. Thankfully though it seems to have fixed the game crashing so Pastor can now sit safe and keep his reputation.  The more I have driven in this game the more and more I'm enjoying racing the AI and the handling model. The Championship season, Quick race and Time trial modes are the ONLY parts of the game I would consider ready to be released. Pro season and Multiplayer however were and STILL ARE NOT READY.  For the first time in the series you can actually race the AI wheel-to-wheel, and unlike Project Cars there aggresion is about right. The AI are very spacially aware so if you were to dive up there inside they won't turn in on you. They are also very racey themselves as they wont back out 100 metres before a braking zone as before, and will try to outbrake you if you leave the door open. For reference I have the AI on the hardest setting.  However I would consider Championship season mode ready,although it does have a few features missing. You can no longer underfuel the car in this game and since you can no longer run rich fuel mix for longer than half a lap before your engine overheats, I end up with around 5 laps of fuel left at the end of a 100% race. You can no longer fully customize your strategy before the race, you can only choose between preselected strategies given to you by your teams strategist and with 100% races, generally speaking you're given 2 options but if you qualify within the top 10 it's normally 1. My final complaint with Championship season mode is the inability to customize the weekend length. There are 3 choices and cant be tweaked. Short weekend- 15 mins practice, one-shot qualifying, 25% race. Normal weekend- 30 mins practice, one qualifying round, 50% race. Long weekend- 1 hour practice, full 3 rounds of qualifying, 100% race.  Quick race works as it should with you being able to actually tweak it to your liking and there's not much else to say. Time Trial has been improved upon now as at most circuits/corners the game is strict with you leaving track limits, but my new favourite feature is you can copy setups from people at the top of the leaderboards. I highly recommend doing this unless you want to be left alone and know what you're doing. My only problem with Time Trial is that at some corners you can still exceed track limits and not have your lap invalidated. Is it really that hard code'masters' to just invalidate laptimes if you exceed track limits with all 4 wheels regardless of time lost/gained?  I feel the need to mention at this point that the F1 2014 season is also included in this game as I'm rather neutral to its integration. Albeit a nice bonus, I bought this game for the 2015 season and would rather have had them focus more time on the current season than the previous one.  The problem with Pro season mode mentioned in my first review is still there and upon further review I think there was no real need for Codemasters to even add this mode as you can change your HUD, assist and camera angle in Championship season mode to the exact same settings.  Now the real big-hitter that is Multiplayer. Blandly put, the multiplayer is a mess, there's no two ways about it. From unpredictable ghosting, to desynchonised lobbies, to driving through pit crews, to just straight up random teleporting, multiplayer is completely and utterly broken. With a supposed brand-new netcode, which showcases Codemasters 'master' coding, multiplayer has been crippled before even mentioning there new matchmaking system known as 'hoppers'. The main problem with the new system is the player base gets spread out so much between the different game types that it takes so much longer to find the game even in the first week since release.  After having played the game for a longer time period now, I would only recommend this game to people if you are only/mainly interested in the singleplayer experience. If Multiplayer was the main attraction stay clear as if it was a sprintmode lap 1 trainwreck of a pileup.  Further updates pending upon release of further patches or DLC. 14/07/15",

Again it feels like a poor console port over which sucks I was hoping for a more stable release I knew there would be some issue's it Codemaster so its to be expected but this is really bad.  This game really needed another couple of month's of work before they released it.  Pros: New engine has improved it  The graphics and optimisation are great I have a GTX 760 OC. I'm getting 60+ FPS with the settings on ultra. Bit easier to navigate around menus Sounds are good  Cons: Barely hear crew chief talking with it set to max No FOV changer No safety car - Get with times codemaster stop been lazy add saftey car lot's of small random bugs like vanishing wheels  Crazy Ai like a bunch of ramming kids but you get the penalty G27 still hard to setup but better than 2014 Feels unfinished     Im very close to refunding this game but I will wait for a few patch's and update this in the future.

            "review_text": "One word. Bad.  I don't have the performance issues some have been having, that said on two GTX980's I expected more than 80fps (I am trying to play at 144, excuse my first world problem) for a game engine that looks exactly the same as each previous installment (with a layer of vaseline over the top). I also challenge the claim they've overhauled the physics engine, it doesn't feel any different than even F1 2012. I had high hopes for the handling model given how well they're doing with Dirt Rally. Boy was my hope misplaced.  However there are a couple of glaring issues besides the general 'meh' ness of the above. The quality of the tracks has decreased dramatically. They just feel subpar, like they spent all their budget on marketing and FOM licenses instead of getting a team out to the tracks to actually make them accurate. As an example the first bend at Suzuka is flat. FLAT. I'm all for non-laser scanned tracks, but only as long as they actually put in some effort.  The other is the utter madness that is controller support. The wheel works fine, at least as far as it recognises basic inputs, but the game will not under any circumstance recognise my Fanatec Clubsport pedals connected to my GT2 wheel or to the PC via usb. Absolute garbage. I mean this is real basic race sim stuff right here, and they got it right for ALL their games in the last 3-4 years, and now somehow they stuff it up? I mean really?  Refund and avoid.",

            "review_text": "So far so crap.  Within the time constraints of Steams refund system I had to try to get this game working well and within 50 minutes I gave up, and here's why.  It ran at the v sync level of 60 fps with frame rate drops that made it not fun to play. Even a few fps is enough to ruin the experience. Turn the settings down I hear you say. The problem is the frame rate drops occurred whether I was running in 3440 x 1440 Ultrawide or 1080p. Exactly the same drops at the same points of the track and even when I set everything to low. It does not hold a steady 60fps in the game. The benchmark works fine, it's even the same track. I get average 88fps on the ultrawide format with everything maxed, but not in game.  My sytem specs ATM are as follows :  - 2 x GeForce GTX Titan X 12GB cards - CPU: Intel Core i7 4790K Overclocked to 4.8GHz  - Motherboard: Asus Maximus VII Formula Z97X - RAM: Avexis Blitz 16GB 2400MHz C10 - Samsung 840 Evo 1TB SSD - Seagate Barracuda 2TB SATA-III Hard Drive - LG 16x Blu Ray writer - OS: Microsoft Windows 8.1 64-Bit - Super Flower Leadex Platinum 1200W Power Supply - Dell Ultrasharp 21:9 Curved monitor - Fully water cooled inside and out :-)  I've ran the game with and without SLi on and I get the exact same fps and with the drops too. It's clearly not right.  Track-IR does not work which would be something sorely missed after enjoying that in previous F1 titles.  Backgrounds pass by like they are being shown on a flip book, there's a certain amount of stutter, flashing that's hard to describe, it's more of a feeling than something you can see if you get my drift. It just doesn't feel smooth even when it is running at 60fps, again that's with and without SLi on.  EDIT : Well the FPS drops have gone now, for some odd reason the game has started to run smoothly in that sense. But the backgrounds still pass by like they are on a flick book, especially Albert Park. It's the trees that seem to have a weird shadow issue that makes the game look jerky. I decided to keep the game and hope that things get sorted out because the basics are there to suggest a good game will be possible eventually.",

            "review_text": "Pro's:  - Graphics; it gets more realistic every year and 2015 is no exception - Stable game - I heard people had problems with error 41's or crashes to desktop: haven't had any. - Realistic driving, pro season got me 4 laps behind - then again I suck without ABS so it should be this way. AI is fun to drive against (although too aggresive at times)  Con's: - Bugs. A lot of them. I feel like being a beta tester, but then I'm not paid or am aware of the game being in beta state. Surely every game has its glitches post-release, but there's a difference between nuisances or game breakers. Gamebreakers are being patched alright, but they shouldn't have existed in such amounts. One or two can happen, five is way too much - Online still hasn't been fixed, 3 weeks after release. One should think racing games such as these have a large multiplayer community...Can't find lobbies, especially the hardcore hopper. And whose idea was it to remove the custom lobbies? - Omitting the career and coop mode. Does this have something to do with the ever-present profile corruption bug? Instead of fixing it, removing it?. Coop was a lot of fun, even with total strangers. It's hidden in the online mode (manually lobby with a friend, then pick the races), but the option has gone from the menu. - Did I mention a lot of bugs?  F1 2013, my previous, was a lot better than this game; the only positive I can find is that the cars are handling better, Codemasters should make F1 2016 (2017?) a better game, if not I suspect the Codemasters series will lose its fanbase, and rightly so. I hope they'll be like Williams (2013-2014): after a suckass game, make a great one.   ",

            "review_text": "F1 Race Stars is a better Formula 1 game than this...... I have been a fan of Codmasters F1 and Dirt series games since the first release. I preordered this game with the information that I read over the internet from reviewers and from the Codies website. I also used my previous experience with Codmasters F1 games as a basis on what type of quality to expect from a game like this one. I have previously purchased Dirt, Dirt 2, Dirt 3, F1 2010 thru 2014 from Steam and for the most part was happy with my purchase. I am also a fan of other racing titles that are more sim than game such as IRacing, Project cars. I have enjoyed playing Race 07, Asetto Corsa except the game server on Asetto Coursa is a joke. I spent many hours in Papyrus titles like GPL and their Nascar series , and also on Geoff Crammonds World Circuit thru his GP4. I have seen both the good and bad of all these titles at their best and worst. I did not set my expectations for F1 2015 any higher than what I had seen them previously release.  Common sense would dictate that a company that has been making F1 games for the PC since their September release in 2010 would have a good handle on what it takes to get a game ready to market. Common sense need not apply here. It seems with the release of F1 2015 Codmasters has indeed returned to it's roots......console gaming. This title was written with that customer in mind, once again letting the PC customer know their business was unimportant to Codemasters.The control menus are a bad joke with the PC customer being the punchline. I was never able to get both my CSW V2 wheel and Richmotech real race gear pedals to work at the same time. It is a game that really does not have a target audience and does not know where to fit in. It is neither a Sim for hardcore enthuiasts or an arcade game strictly for fun. It lacks the features needed to entice the player into the simulated world of F1 Racing. This game is like a bad coat of paint aimed squarely at oblivion and doesn't really cover up all the problems underneath. With a shameful lack of content considering what was in previous releases, there is No fuunctional safety car, No TV interviews, No career mode, No co-op mode, No Classic F1 cars, No season challenge, No rival system, No champions mode, No SLI support, No split screen, No motorhome. No paddock and No TV interviews. The sheer scarcity of options and modes means this is yet another year where the 'Official F1 tie-in' never even gets to the starting grid. The amount of modes left out of this title is borderline criminal and scandalous. It feels like less than half a game was released at a premium price no less. This title is far inferior to 2014, which was in turn inferior to the 2013 release. I don't believe most buyers will believe this is a 'less is more' situation, but rather a trend to charge more and give less. They 'throw in' the 2014 season as a bonus, because it's obvious they intend to BONE US with this title and the absense of so much of what should be seen as standard for F1. Codemasters really should kiss you before you buy this game, since it seems their intent is to just screw you, perhaps you would feel less used after. This publisher is so hell bent on hitting it's yearly release schedule that it pulled this one out of the oven half baked, and a easy bake oven they got a at a garage sale at that.  I run a high end system and love to see titles push that hardware for what its worth. My current rig features a core !7-5960, 64 gb ddr4, (2) Titan X video cards in SLI, 2 ASUS G-sync 27' monitors at a res of 5890 x 1080 bezel corrected @144 hz. Aparently I would have had better results on a console system with this title. It crashed the first few times I ran a benchmark test so bad I needed to reload my video drivers and recalibrate the monitors as this game had them stuck in limbo after multiple crashes. This game crashes more than Maldonado and Grosjean combined. The graphics looked bad even when I got them to display, but they were constantly blinking and flashing, seemingly fishing for a proper state of display this catastrophy of a game could not deliver. It looked like it was snowing in Singapore and it nearly caused me to have suffer a seizure from the constant screen blinking. Because I never was ablle to get my wheel and pedals working at the same time, even though they worked fine in all their previous titles, I can not comment on the physics. The track textures have a filtery feeling that left me nausiated as well. This game is so awkwardly stylized it's more like a bad cartoon Anime, than a racing title.  I would have to say that after a few hours of utter frustration spent trying to fix all the problems that run rampant with simple setup of this game, that the quit menu works great and that's about all. But even that suffers from problems as Steam then tries desperately to download some sort of non-existent update and finishes on an error 41. I suggest we all quit buying these type of half baked mess and let Codemasters know it no excuses as it is not their first rodeo, but could be their last. The best thing to do with this game is delete it permantly from your drive. There are plenty of good titles that offer proper racing that works to deal with this junk. Return it and get a refund while you can. Don't let them pull the wool over your eyes with idle promises to fix it....baaaahhhh bahhhhh.  In a side note to STEAM, shame on you too. I have been a customer for over 8 years and have never even tried to return a title. I tried multiple times to get a refund on this as I was never able to complete even one lap, but was told that beacause I had more than 2 hours of trying to fix this worthless piece of junk, that they would not refund my money. Instead opting to join their co-conspirator Codmasters in ripping of a loyal customer for short term profit. Shame on you STEAM and Codmasters, I have purchased many of your products and recommended them to my friends, alas my policy is changed on that too. I will NEVER pre purchase a title again with this return policy. I had always believed that STEAM treated their customers fairly and with respect, but I see this was yet another lesson learned from this terible gaming experience.  Your money would be much better spent on the 2012 or 2013 Codemasters F1 games than this abortion of a game. I would recommend Project Cars or IRacing to anyone looking for a Racing Sim. Had either of those titles offered all the cars or tracks from the current F1 season I would have never bothered with this lackluster castrophy in the first place. Save your money and buy something else.",

            "review_text": "CAUTION: DUE TO THE STATE OF THIS GAME, THIS REVIEW IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE  Okay, so Codemasters have really confused me with this one. Their F1 series, while generally good (2013 being their best effort, at least for me), has always lacked that little bit of magic to truly set it apart from previous, and quite frankly, better F1 games.  F1 2015 had the opportunity to really set a new standard for the genre, with Codemasters finally taking the hint and using the power of next generation gaming platforms to build a newer, more modern engine.  What followed is a product that has ultimately both satisfied and disappointed me for various reasons. Here we go.  PROS  - The handling model. Yes. Finally. I can't believe it. Codies have actually managed to produce cars which drive and feel great. And not in the 'easy' sense of things. Turn the aids off, and you will struggle for traction, you will pump the brakes to keep them from locking, and you will need lightning reactions to correct over/understeer and avoid damaging your car and tyres. The feedback provided through the wheel is great, and you almost instantly know you've taken a corner well, even with your eyes shut. It truly is satisfying when you really nail a corner, let alone a whole lap.  - The Presentation. One thing Codies Racing fans have been asking for since 2010 is a more TV-styled game, and this year they finally deliver. The often talked about Broadcast Presentation before and after races is great, with TV style camera angles and OSDs that come close to the FOM world feed. The commentary is awesome too, with lots and lots of varied lines, you don't really hear much of the same thing, and it just gels. It doesn't sound robotic and mis-matched like previous attempts at putting commentary in an F1 game. (I'm looking at YOU, Championship Edition.)  And that's about it, I'm afraid. All that I really enjoy about this game. Those two points. I'm serious. Really.  Here's a quick mish-mash of all the cons then:  CONS  - Codemasters giveth, and they doth taketh away. Want to race as yourself? Too bad. It's gone. Want to race with equal setups in Time Attack to truly find who is the best? Shame, that's gone too. Safety Car? Gone. Season Challenge? Gone. Scenario Mode...you get the idea.  - The game doesn't seem to save my preferences and I find myself having to redo custom controls every I boot up.  - Online Multiplayer. No. Just no.  - Then there's the numerous bugs and glitches truly representative of an unfinished game. Just type in F1 2015 glitches/bugs in Youtube and you'll pretty much get what I mean.  - Codies' amazing idea to pad out the game with 2014 content and hope no-one notices.  It's a shame that, while Codemasters finally got something amazingly right in F1 2015, there are too many places where they just fall flat on their faces. I really don't know if I can review this as Recommended. I guess if the improved handling model is all you ever wanted, then it's great. Have a blast. However, if you were looking forward to a more comprehensive game with more appeal beyond just a World Championship Season, then just stick with F1 2013, it really is still the best. ",

Hang your heads in shame, Codemasters!  The PC version should look absolutely stunning now that the consoles versions are 'next gen' but somehow it looks worse than last year in some areas.   The handling is quite nice once you get a feel for it but the braking is very unpredictable and you can't trail brake like you would in PCars/Corsa/Iracing etc.  There seems to be a new glitch every 30s. If you use a flashback from terminal damage the game will continue to run in black and white once you have continued. You seem to get constantly kicked from online lobbys just as the race is about to begin. Online there is a gearbox bug that means you are always in the limiter no matter what gear you use. As with previous games you need to use vsync for your wheel to work properly. If you decide to restart a race it will put you in neutral.

Then for some reason when I pressed the accelerator the wheels animated and eventually started smoking but the car didn't move at all on track (not a traction control problem, another bug). Then the cinematic cut scenes are garbled too. Another possible bug (not included in the four above) is getting errors when the game tries to communicate with the steam servers (something I've never experienced with any other game). I've played the previous games in the series and quite enjoyed them. If you want a decent racing game at the minute I suggest assetto corsa. Codemasters should be embarrassed. Getting a refund.",

After a few minutes spent on the track, my first impressions are of mixed-bag...  Good: -Massive improvement on engine (PU) sounds compared to F1 2014 -Significantly better looking than F1 2013. -Handling is very good (with a joypad) -Podium Cutscenes (but I don't mind about the in-game narrator) -Well optimized. Runs at 60fps with a r9 270, i7 4770 on medium/highs after driver update -Almost instant flashbacks, and because of the AI's behaviour, it's a relief -Can change race settings during loading  Bad: -No safety car -Damage physics are several steps backwards compared to previous installments -Can't disable texture blur -Penalty system seems more lenient on crashes -Split-screen taken away -The McLaren Honda engine sounds terrific... -Online features are broken. When I hosted one game, there were 10 players, but when I start the race, all players but one just disappeared and the game kicked me to the main menu due to 'not enough players'. Also when I join a lobby, I'm always kicked from the start. Bring back open lobbies, and fix this please ! -AI is aggressive on Medium and Hard setting, they pushed me several times out of the track. When they get ahead thanks to DRS and/or a superior power unit, the AI just changes its trajectory and brakes hard, preventing the player to overtake back and get the nose stuck to their rear-end instead...Can't imagine Pro Mode without flashbacks then (or with a non-Mercedes powered car ).  Mediocre -...but still sounding dull , especially on downshifts and in the pit lane -lack of personality. I personally appreciate the scrapping of the tutorial mode on single player and the email messaging system on career mode. Championship mode is enough for me, but I guess I'm in a part of the minority on that one -the game crashes on exit -Non realistic practices sessions -the steering wheel display could display more useful information  -still no installation lap... -sometimes, the leaderboard is not getting updated in time trial mode (bug) -the HUD has not evolved much since F1 2010 -Penalty system for corner cutting is annoying: it doesn't mind if you cut on Chicane at Spa and gained 1 full second, but it gives a 10-second penalty (25%race) when putting 2 tires out on 130 R and losing some time at Suzuka. Ridiculous.  Conclusion The series have been overhauled with a 'new' game engine, but it's hampered by teething issues and limitations so it needs some maturation before the major bugs get ironed out, and more features to come for the next year.   6.3/10.",

I was really hyped for this game, but my god they screwed it up.  +Better and cleaner UI +Better AI, the AI actually overtakes you this time +Beautiful lighting +Realistically modeled cars +You can push the car more due to less unpredictable wheelspin +Both the 2015 and the 2014 F1 seasons are playable +Better commentery/tv-style +Tire sqeal can finally be heard properly  -Game crashes alot -FPS drops are common, dropping to 9 FPS and staying there very frequently -Colours are very washed out -I cannot look back in the 3rd person view -Engine sounds are far too quiet -Limited Anti-Aliasing options, WHERE IS MSAA? -Blur, motion blur cannot be deactivated, WTF? -No introduction scene before the race start like in previous games -AI likes to punt you in the wall in some corners, for example Eau Rouge -The graphics are messed up, everything is very blury and smeary, absolutely horrific, WTF HAPPENED? -No safety car, WTF ARE YOU THINKING CM? -No Co-op, WTF ARE YOU THINKING CM? -FFB is horribly weak and inacurrate, almost no effects, worse than every before in a CM F1 game, WTF HAPPENED? -Why is it not possible to adjust each session length in championship mode? -Damage model is pathetic and far too forgiving, wait is this 2005 or 2015? -Rev counter on the steering wheel is still broken and far too short like in F1 2014 -ALT+TAB does not work properly -Hardly any tire smoke when locking up -Long loading times  PC specs: i7 4790k, r9 290, 16GB DDR3, G27 for more info see my profile  All in all I cannot recommend this game in its current state, the game is completely screwed, lacking featuires and will make you want to buy a pair of glasses. To be honest F1 2014 is probaly a better buy. I think I might test Steam's refund policy.  10.07.2015, F1 2015 v.1.0  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- EDIT:  So after raging quite a bit yesterday I completed a few 25% quick races on different tracks with some of the 2015 and 2014 spec F1. Championship mode is literally unplayable due to it bein at 9 FPS the entire time. So in this small list I will go into the actual racing aspect of F1 2015 and the changes compared to last years game.  +Handling model has been vastly improved, more traction, less unpredictable wheelspin, the rear of the car is still quite a challenge which is good +The AI actually races you this time around, there is lots of wheel to wheel action, and the AI even completes switchback moves and dosen't back out of a move very often +Pits stops are now just as quick as in real life and the times vary per team and your crew can mess up +The AI is not as slow on the first lap, like in previous games +Fuel management is now realistic becuase upshifting early and lifting and coasting actually make a difference +The AI race each other with realistic consequences +Front wing gets damags more easily +The effects of dirty are are noticable +Wet racing is possible again, due to the AI not being overpowered anymore +AI make mistakes and it is great to see them having to deal with oversteer and slipping on the grass +The sparks that fly from the car directly infront of you are implemented very well +Penalty system usually fairly affects AI cars +Racing is just more fun with all cars batteling each other a lot of the time, going 3-wide into corners and stuff like that +AI causes crashes +More cinematics, grid walk podium etc. +You can ask the engineer for information  -AI is not aware of you when it is rejoining the track and subsequently knocks you off -AI cars which need to be lapped do not get out of the way most of the time, therefore endangering your race -The rev counter on the in-game steering wheel is still wrong, just like last year -When exiting the pits with the pit assist option deactivated you are stuck in 2nd gear, therefore you lose a lot of time -The AI is always, and I repeat ALWAYS faster than you in a straight line, I have had Mclaren-Hondas pull away from me whilst I am driving a Force India and using DRS -2015 and 2014 car balance is not correct: 2015: Mclaren, Red Bull, Sauber too strong; Mercedes powered cars too weak (The cars are correctly balanced when you are driving them, but not when the AI is driving them, 2014: Mclaren is too powerful, haven't tested the rest (Again the AI cars are not balanced for example the Marussia is not runnung in the back like the Caterhams are) -There are alot of races where the weather is grey and dark and it is raining, but the track dosen't look wet and the dry tires work significatly better than the intermediates -The AI like to drive away from you in a train most of the time and you don't have a chance due to them blitzing down the straights -The damage model is pathetic and way too forgiving most of the time -The side pod glitch has kinda moved to the area between the sidepod and the front wheels, touch a car there and you just spin -The fuel mode menu is too slow, so that it takes too long to switch between modes whilst driving -The 'talk to the engineer menu' dissapears way to quickly after opening it, therefore rendering it useless -No tire smoke when youn lock tyres, or cars spin, therefore there are no immersive 'trying to avoid an incident which has occured ahead' moments -Blury graphics and motion blur really strain the eyes after ~30 mins -When it start raining and you have to change ti intermidiate tyres and you do so on your schedueled pit stop and haven't used the menu to select the intermidiate tyres, you will have slicks put on during the pit stop, this affects the AI most of the time too -DRS is often enabled in wet conditions -A lot of scenarios where you better of with slicks on a wet track  All in all the actual racing have vastly improved over last years game, now if codies would just address the blury graphics, add MSAA then this review would be positive and this game would be worth a buy.",

My only two complaints I have and they are pretty nitpicky, I was hoping for formation laps and manual pitting (instead of auto piloting to your crew). But then I realized (especially in multiplayer) people would fail to land on their real position on the grid, or run over their pit crew, and complain about that instead of setting up their graphics wrong.  Overall, great game, pro season is awesome. Very tough (What I want). I'm still on Autrailia P1 trying to get within 5 seconds of hamilton",

            "review_text": "I bought this racing sim/game recently and love it. I'm only about 7-hours into it, but wow, great job with this release. I just ignored all the negative reviews and jumped right in, knowing most of the negatives were prior to the many patches and fixes. My intorduction to 2015 was after all the new release hoopla and problems (just purchased 01/30/2016), and long after the patches and bug fixes were released, so I do not and have not suffered from all the issues you see in reviews that are 1-6 months old. Also it's smooth as silk running at max settings with 1920x1080 resolution AMD 8320 8-core.   I have 2014 as well and have fully enjoyed that on the PS3 and also just bought it for my PC, adding some nice graphic mods - 2014 is great looking in it's own right but with the new visual mods it's fantastic and with very cool game play options. With that said, 2015 looks a little better but not a huge leap from 2014 imo, especially with visual mods added to 2014 - but 2015 looks better non-the-less unmoddd thus far. The one thing is I don't see MSAA antialiasing, which is weird that 2015 wouldn't have that setting.  Now the car and handling are much improved (ie harder to drive) with much better physics over 2014. Need a very light touch on throttle and brakes or you'll feel like your driving on an ice rink (I only use medium TC assist, nothing else). You have to finess the car handling and acceleration if you want to keep from crashing. The first impression is the very real sensation and 'feel' of driving the real thing; a highly unstable and fast F-1 racer - much much moreso than 2014.   After driving 2015 for a several hours with practice laps/time trials, I jumped into 2014 and with all assists off it was almost easy and a little 'rail like'. After all the difficulty I have with pushing the new 2015 platform it makes jumping into 2014 a much easier drive. The actual feeling of driving in 2015 is there in all it's glory, muchmoreso than 2014, and '14 is no slouch imo (I know the iRacing guys will probably laugh). So I'll do most of my heavy practicing in 2015 and use 2014 to race online and for it's neat carreer mode and vintage racers.   And the audio in 2015....wow, that is something I noticed immediatly...so much fuller, louder, rich and deep. The car and engine audio is leaps and bounds above 2014, very immersive. The car, it simply screams!!  I've not done any career races or online racing yet in 2015, so not sure about the AI or how well career mode is. I do know you drive as a real driver, not as yourself, which is odd to me. The career mode in 2014 is pretty cool, you get to do well and sign with better teams. Not so with 2015 which is a dissapointment - oh well.   As for multiplayer, I guess there are still issues with the netcode for 2015 so it seems as of right now most of the online F1 leagues are racing with 2014 until Codeies fix 2015 multiplayer - hopefully soon.  All in all I'm loving it so far. Not that deep into it yet, but I'm working on it. I'd definately recomend it. I just don't see where all the hate is coming from as I don't see anything that would merit it at all in its current state. I assume alot of it comes from the pre patch versions, but who knows. Expectations can get out of control I guess.  EDIT: Oh, one thing - no trackIR support for 2015 far as I can tell. It works for 2014, but can't get it to function in 2015.   My $.02 worth!

I had some initial issues with menus/graphics but now the game seems to be running smoothly (at least on my rig) here are some thoughts:  1. Graphics - much has been made on here of the blurring and I experienced this myself initially. Once I realised the game was selecting the onboard graphics by default rather than my dedicated graphics card I was able to change my card settings and it was like playing a different game. On ultra settings the game is visually very good and the sense of speed is palpable. 2. Control - I'm one of those troglodytes who still uses the keyboard so I can't comment on the gamepad/wheel issues experienced by others. Keyboard preset 2 appears to be unusable due to some glitch in the handling when you select that preset but using the standard keyboard setup the handling is very good. 3. AI - a lot has also been made of cars running into the back of you in races. In the quick race I tried, the only time someone ran into the back of me was when I made a stupid driving error. Otherwise the cars behind behaved very well and the pressure of the pack breathing down my neck really added to the feel of the game.  Overall I would give this a big thumbs up. Hopefully the bugs will be rectified quickly so that everyone can enjoy the experience.",

No Career but I understand why Codemasters killed it to help with the license. Can be glitchy. It forgets my steerign wheel controls even though they're saved under custom. Legend AI are too easy won 17 races as Daniel Ricciardo.

Owning all of Codies F1, Grid and DiRT titles I cannot understand some the criticism voiced. No one can seriously believe that the graphics are a step back.

            "review_text": "Got this for christmas. I havent played an F1 game since 2010 or 2011 on the PS3. Around 2013 I built a gaming PC and generally stuck to RFactor/Game Stock Car or Race 07. I had read the reviews, and had decided to stay away from it. I've become fairly engrossed by 'sims' and aside from Wreckfest, Id stay away from acradey racers.   But X-Mas day my better half gave this to me, and I have to admit I dont really understand what all the negativity is about. The graphics are great, and the physics are definately drivable and very fun even if a tad arcadey. I've been playing offline on expert mode and its challenging enough to have a decent race in the top 4 in a Williams [my fav team]; when normally in these games I finished races miles ahead of AI. The AI is one of the better offline ones Ive raced [aside from maybe GSC] and its equally interesting watching to cars ahead race each other, hoping they will cost themselves time and allow you to catch up.  It's a little bit twitchy on an XBox 350 controller, but its spot on with a G25 wheel. Definately worth a buy if your an F1 fan!",

            "review_text": "I only use the game in single player, so the issues with multiplayer don't affect me and it is very clear that the entire core of the game is a massive improvement. Handling is excellent, the tyre wear and performance of the AI has FINALLY been correctly implemented - AND they are slower in the rain! The racing against the AI is also terrific fun. Overall the game 'feels' right and CM now have a solid base to build on. It is a great shame that it has taken this long to get to this stage, but as I understand it the previous game engine wasn't up to the job. I see no reason now why F12016 shouldn't be a fantastic game -The core 'engine' is now stable, they need to sort the bugs and the multiplayer, put the safety car back in and reintroduce classic cars in the next edition we will have the definitive F1 game. Will that happen? Who knows....but I feel that things are definitetly heading in the right direction, and urge those who can't get the game to work to be patient until the bugs are fixed, as this is a very fun game to play in single player (and hopefully in multiplayer, once that is fixed...)",

            "review_text": "So, the game has improved a lot. You find my original review down there.  But let me say, that the game in it's current form is a good game. Most of the bugs were fixed and multiplayer actually works, if you find people to play.   So If you do not need to have the new licences and just want a fun racing game to play now and then, you should get this one, because it's surely going to be cheaper than the new F1 2016.       Original Review:  The game is really not that bad as it sounds, and it would definitely deserve a good rating, once the bugs are fixed.  The game does some thing right of course and it's not all bad. You do have the new engine which is pretty great graphically, the new physics are really good and it's really fun to play. The AI is also better then the years before. They drive more agressively (i.e. attack you on the outside of a corner etc.) and make less misstakes just by themselves, but of course also try to overtake you with smokeing tyres sometimes. Good job there. But then you run into a bug...  And that's the problem, there are many bugs, which sometimes prevent you from even finishing a race (getting stuck in the pits or something like that). There are some other glitches which are pretty annoying. Some people even say, that the game crashes from time to time, which, I must say, has never happened to me so far. But there is one dealbreaker which makes game game bad right now...  Multiplayer on PC simply is not playable. 90% of the time, you don't even find a lobby and when you do, most of the times the game gives you a disconnect just short before the start of the race.   So is the game bad? No it's not, it's just not out of beta test as of now. There is a really strong foundation here, and it would really be a good game, once all the bugs are fixed. So my verdict is: If you just want to play single player and enjoy good racing against AI, you could get the game if you don't mind a bug here or there... You could of course also wait till the bugs are fixed. If, however, you want to play multiplayer, don't get it! Wait till the bugs are confirmed to be fixed, and then you have yourself a good game to play.",
