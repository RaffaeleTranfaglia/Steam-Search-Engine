            "review_text": "I recieved a code for this game in order to review it, but I was not paid for my review.  Considering this game takes its inspiration directly from my favorite novel by Jules Verne, whether or not to play this game was a no-brainer for me. This game is a great example of an interactive novel. You are Passepartout, Phileas Fogg's valet, and it your job to plan the route that will take you Around the World in 80 Days ( I couldn't resist). As you plan your route, you have to manage the finances which involves purchasing gear that will help speed up travel or be more comfortable, or purchase artifacts or luxury items to sell in other parts of the world. The routes you can take depend on what maps you have, and who you talk to. There are so many ways to travel around the world, and so many side stories to be discovered. Expect multiple playthroughs to discover them all. The only potential drawback with this game is that you have to read everything. There are nice backgrounds to each place you go but the game relies on the players imagination to visualize a great bulk of the action. Overall, this is a very fun game with loads of replayability.   UPDATE: I just want to say that knowing what I now know about this game, I would have paid full price for this game.  Expect a much more fleshed out review coming soon from The Adventure Lantern!",

            "review_text": "Bottom line up front!  Pros:  +Takes less than two hours for a full playthrough. +Tons of replayability +Great visuals; it reminds me very much of a well-designed board game. The conveyances in particular are well rendered, which you may see in the screenshots. The map itself is very nice. +Good ambient sound and music +It's a piece of interactive fiction with a story to tell. There aren't 'wrong' choices, just different ones. +The Phineas Fogg health mechanic is EXCELLENT! Instead of managing your character's health, you are charged as Mr. Fogg's valet. You may abuse him or care for him as your whim dictates. +The system is relatively intuitive and operates very much as though you had a globe and touch-menu available in your room. They ported it from iOS or whatever very well. +The game autosaves often, which offers an easy way to treat this as a casual game. I did not mind that I couldn't manually save given the relatively short amount of time it took to play a journey.  Cons:  -Every journey (so far for me) starts from London to Paris. -Playing through a journey sort of wears out the fun. Each journey builds toward the triumphant return to London (if you make it!), so for me starting a new trip right after completing one felt more like a burden than a truly new adventure -Each city, conveyance, and character has its own art, but really the only striking art was the conveyance. The characters are very much colored cameo/silhouettes, while cities are a bit forgettable. -No tutorial or other instruction is readily apparent. It took me half an hour to figure out that it was easier to use the arrow keys to switch between possible routes and an hour to figure out that my character needed particular equipment in order to negotiate quicker passage with the available conveyances.  In all, if you're even considering getting this game then I recommend it. It's a nice way to while away the time on a lazy afternoon or quiet evening, offering a bit of adventure to contemplate. The script author is an excellent writer, and I very much enjoyed seeing what she came up with. I think it's a good bargain at $10. That's how much I would spend on a two hour movie and I expect to get quite a bit more time out of this game than that.",

I love the steampunk elements - they feel true to the spirit of the original, if not to the letter of it - and the development of Passepartout as a character is excellent. The writing is very rich, and there are some truly affecting moments.   Thanks to the ever-ticking clock you can't explore everything in one game, but every playthrough offers glimpses of possible adventures that you can seek out next time. Every time I finish a journey I want to start again and see what happens if I do something a bit differently - explore a new route, build different relationships, pursue a new achievement. I've got so involved with this game that I still haven't got round to installing the game I actually bought the Humble Bundle to acquire...",

If times are hard, there are ways to earn cash but of course, that means delays in the trip itself. It's also fun to see where people are in their own journeys and the choice to share your own journey is great.   It's not surprising that the game can eventually become repetitive but there's enough stories to keep it from happening for a while.

            "review_text": "I bought it on sale along with a bunch of other games, didn't get around to it for a couple of months. I was curious and wanted to try it, but the screenshots made me a little reluctant. Honestly going into it, I thought it was going to be a linear, pre-plotted course. I thought the decisions would be in the dialogue, where occasionally you might give advice regarding the next destination.  I was pleasantly surprised. You get to choose the course entirely, also each time you play (or at least every time I've played) the seed changes. I'm not even sure what all that changes, all I know is I've plotted a different course every time I played and each time offered quite a different journey. This game is a lot of fun and really rich with adventure. I did not expect the replayability to be so high, but it truly is great. I've gone on four runs, so far.  On my first run, I was still familiarizing myself with the game and made some poor decisions. We were late, and made it back to London in 90 days (I got stuck in Africa, my only way out was an airship full of people mad at me for riding in on a slaver ship, I had to spend a week and a half begging for money to afford the venture). I was pleased to discover that even once you pass the 80 day mark, you still plot your way home as normal, there's no instant YOU LOSE screen or anything.  On my second run, armed with my new knowledge of how the game works, I pulled off a round-the-world trip in only 60 days! Huzzah!  On my third run, I believe was my trip north, I made it in 50 days. That was quite adventurous.  My most recent run I did not break my record or anything, it was 60-70 days and I took over a ship, beat a champion boxer, and came home with $10,000, and my peak during our trip was $17,000.

It also does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're on a journey as you only see snipets of characters' lives before you are whisked away. The writing is superb and the simple presentation encourages your imagination to run wild.  Gameplay-wise it's very simple. It's most like a visual novel with some very simple time, inventory, and money management to push you along.  Representation-wise this game is also fantastic. The world is a crazy steampunk Victorian era. Half the drivers, captains, and pilots as well as incidental characters are women. The racial diversity is also plentiful, as one would hope of a game about traveling around the world. Additionally, half the romance options are female and half are male. If you're turned off by all this SJW crap, you should play the game anyway. It all works in service of building a unique and varied world that's not just entirely populated by white men with brown hair and giving you a sense of the rich tapestry of people that inhabit the entire world.  Overall, you should absolutely pick this game up. It can get a bit repetitive as you repeat travel routes and stories multiple times, but it's not so much that it's a deal breaker. The game is also available on mobile devices, which perfectly suits the traveling nature of the game. I highly recommend you try it.",

One thing worth noting, though, is that actually winning the wager is meaninglessly easy. The only way to lose is to intentionally wander off; any course that points vaguely eastward will get you there in 70 days or less.

When it comes to gameplay, there is an aspect of money management which involves buying low and selling high in different places, and then choosing an appropriate mode of travel between each location (fast, comfortable and expensive, or slow, uncomfortable and cheap), You have to keep your master happy but also remain responsible with his/your funds throughout the journey. Despite this, the games primary focus is the text-based character interactions and the thoughts and descriptions of the player character when visiting new cities and travelling in different interesting vehicles. The game also features several dialogue choice segments which can influence what other people think of you and your masters opinion of you.  While I have not yet made it all the way around the world in either of my playthroughs (It takes probably a good 3 hours to do so), I find myself frequently wanting to come back to it but rarely end up gettting around to it, hense my fairly low play time. This game is a delight to play if you are in a lazy mood and want a chilled out but entertaining experience that will last an hour or two until you put it aside for next time. Furthermore, this game has a fair amount of replay value as you are able to choose your own journey (you will not get to visit every city / country in one playthrough due to your 80 day / turn time constraint).

A literary classic told through fitting music, charming art that while simple never becomes boring and surprisingly deep and involving game mechanics. I was physically unable to stop my journey once it had first begun, and though much of it was played relatively safe there was still plenty of close shaves and action which made the entire experience one of the best adventures I've had in a game in recent memory. Sadly, I did not make the first trip in 80 days, in part due to poor planning but also from being marooned on a small island in the middle of the pacific ocean where Mr. Fogg almost left his senses. I am already excited to start my next playthrough, with so much of the world left to discover I believe it won't be the last one, either.  If I had to have one complaint, only one, it is that I felt like I experienced an abnormally high amount of female characters compared to male ones. From my start in London, over Paris, Copenhagen, into Russia and across the middle east, East-Asia to New Zealand and into the dark heart of Africa and back into Europe, the amount of male characters I encountered could be counted on one hand (and left me wondering where they all were. Replaced by automatons?). On one hand it was humours, given the game takes places in an (albeit fictional) period of time where women were not often seen in these very male-centric professions, on the other the almost total lack of male characters (and the game at one point describing a grizzled boiler-room engineer as a petite Indian women in a beautiful sari) took a little away from the overall immersion, and I had to wonder if it was intentional or if my route just happened to let me encounter every possible pilot, captain and engineer of the feminine persuasion.

If you know the original novel, you'll enjoy the tone and style of this game. Even without, it's a light-hearted, fun and surprising piece of interactive fiction. In 1 playthrough I got abducted by pirates, lost a boxing match, led a mutiny to become captain of a ship, got shipwrecked and enjoyed brief romantic dalliances in Russia and New Orleans.",

Great game with a lot of replay valuable. The writing is fantastic and the choices you make feel like they matter.",

Choices aren't particularly interesting and consequences don't correlate, so choices/decisions feel even more irrelevant. Buggy, cumbersome user-interface (epecially suitcases and maps). I played through two full trips. First trip took way longer than 80 days. Second trip I barely made it under 80 days, but only by always choosing the most obvious/safe/known decision paths (e.g. avoided talking to strangers as that usually stretched the story/travel time), which was dull and boring. I get that it's meant to be an experience, not about the objective of 80 days, but the experience wasn't particularly rewarding for me personally. The stories that wove together weren't fun or interesting or even necessarily imaginative.",

I haven't played this type of game before and unfortunately I found it to be incredibly dull. I don't care if my choices matter if the results of my choices are boring, not matter what I choose. Also, to make it through this game you have to record fascinating details such as 'pocket watches sell well in Moscow'. How interesting, can't wait to learn more.",
