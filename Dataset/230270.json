The aesthetics of the color combinations are very pretty in the minimal atmosphere, the awesome UI is fun navigating through and very well designed. The soundtrack is constantly bumping, never a dull moment.  I haven't even mentioned the amazingly tight-momentum-controlled gameplay or the sheer number of available levels (+2,000), the immense proportion of their elegant design, their witty/fun names and the great satisfaction from completing a tight and smartly designed episode (set of 5) levels.  This game is an immediate very good game in my opinion, I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a challenging platformer that asks a bit more of you and doesn't rely on simple gimmicks to make the gameplay unique. The thoughtfulness in the level design, the difficulty and the visibly implicit effort dedicated to making a solid package that stands out is exactly what I need to see to be so happy with a platformer game.   Much love and appreciation to Metanet for taking their time to refine N to the point it's at today, could not be happier for them.",

Thankfully, the original free flash game is still available to play online after all these years. Run a google search for 'N flash game' and N 2.0 should be the first result.  N++ is a version for people who want more. More levels, more obstacles and 'enemies', more modes including co-op and racing (but not online, which has upset some people).. If you like a game that is challenging but fair, you'll probably enjoy it. The controls are tight, and the physics of the movement of the character is a fun aspect of the game to get a 'feel' for. You will actually feel yourself getting better at the game the more you play.  Keyboard controls have always worked fine for the original N, but of course this version supports controller, and I have grown quite fond of playing this way already.  All in all, this is a fine quality PC game. It doesn't feel like a rough port of another version or anything.. it runs well, handles well, it's a significant upgrade content-wise and visually from the oldschool N, and I think it's worth the money, so I give it my recommendation.",

Moreover, several of the cons seem like minor bugs which could probably be fixed soon.  If you want to trial N++ without buying it, I suggest playing  the original game  [www.kongregate.com] . If you like it, this game is better and would be worth the price.",

Now they have finalized this massive project into this masterpiece after some detours on consoles and handhelds. This version includes all levels from the 3 versions of the game (original, console, this one) plus the infinity of levels created by the communauty. It does have its flaws and it 'sometimes' gets frustrating but that's all part of it because even when you fail, the death, ragdoll and explosions are absolutely worth it. If you are searching for the ultimate plaformer game, look no further, pick N++, you won't regret it.",

Without all of the extra stuff other platformers have, you come out with something that is really challenging but mixes skill and stratgey where you can see the entire level on one screen, everything is a one hit kill, and movement is as ninjasome as it can ever be. There's no RNG, so it's all about knowing how everything can kill you, finding out how not to die, then having the skill to actually do it. Unlike just about every other game out there, N(++) will run on absoluetly anything at 60 fps. Seriously, don't worry about your specs. And if you really don't want to pay a small price of $15, there is always the good old free version  N 2.0  [www.thewayoftheninja.org]  which is very much the same, just with less levels and enemies, and a different grahpical style.

The controls are perfection, the graphics are amazing, the soundtrack is great, literally my only problem with it is that the level-sharing system doesn't appear to have many levels at all, (they said 10k but it's more like 30), but that very well could be because the game JUST came out on pc, so there hasn't been a lot of time to make levels. I think I remember hearing about cross-platform (ps4) level/leaderboard sharing that doesn't appear to be working, but that very well might be a problem just for me.   In all other aspects (aka the whole game) this is amazing.   If you've never played an n game before there is N and Nv2.0 to get the feel of it, but I definitely recommend buying this if you like it, because while those might be free, they're definitely not as good as this... at least, not in terms of art, music, game mechanics, and amount of levels.",

            "review_text": "It's funny that there's still an audience for games as simple as  N++ . With the tech available to game developers now, one would think there'd almost be an expectation to make hyper-realistic and fluidly animated third-person cover shooters that probably only run at a cinematic 24 frames per second on most computers. The appeal of a 2D platformer is that it is - and almost always will be - extremely self-explanatory. Upon launching N++, it will take most people under 30 seconds to have everything figured out. It's the age-old mantra of 'easy to learn, hard to master' that so many genres will simply never be able to get right.  That said, it could be argued that the reason  N++  is so simple to learn is because of its apparent fear of doing anything to differentiate it from the rest of the genre as a whole. To hone in on the problem, one should look to the previous instalments of the series. Originating as a free 2004 browser game, simply titled   N   [www.thewayoftheninja.org] , the title was later released as on Xbox Live Arcade as  N+ , including the addition of a well-received online multiplayer component. With the release of  N++ , it becomes pretty clear that developer Metanet Software isn't going to budge. The obscure titling begs the question: is this a sequel or a remake? The fact that all the levels are different per game says sequel, but the fact that the gameplay is perfectly identical screams 'stand-alone DLC'. Which is truthfully what  N++  probably should have been. It shows no characteristics of an entirely new game, and doesn't feel like a great investment if you've already played the previous two games.  By itself,  N++  is a great game. The gameplay is smooth and the minimal graphic style is sleek and professional. As with the previous games, it strikes a solid balance between fair and frustrating, and the local multiplayer modes are a blast with friends, including a tough-as-nails co-op mode in which both players are all but required to play at peak performance to complete the specifically designed levels. Race mode is by far the most enjoyable, as it lends an element of speedy precision that's missing from the solo levels thanks to a jump button so floaty that it's practically a feature.  The acclaimed online multiplayer is notably absent this time around, and criticism by fans was met with excuses stinking of the procrastinatory air that hangs over the product. It feels like the words 'can't be bothered' must have been uttered frequently during development, because it is quite literally a shiny new coat over an 11-year-old game that can still be played for free online.  N++  gets a tentative recommendation, although there has to be a point where one does have to wonder if such a thing is worth playing, because have no doubt about it - you have seen all of this before.",

It also manages to be as challenging as N+ but, thanks to there being so many more levels, the difficulty curve is much more even and you shouldn't find yourself locked out of levels (with N+ I found a good third of the levels were permanently inaccessible to me because I hit and brick wall of difficulty and just couldn't unlock them; that's much less of a problem here).

            "review_text": "I spent hours and hours back in the day playing N, the free Flash game that preceded N+ and N++. For that alone I would have passed some money the developer's way, but N++ is definitely worth it by itself. It's a tough, unforgiving platformer in the mould of Super Meat Boy (or vice versa, given how old N is). It has a peculiar momentum-based approach to platformer (screw physics!). Once you get the hang of it, you'll be performing incredible walljumps and near-flying around levels. There's a huge amount of levels to play; 9 hours in and I've barely completed half of them.  If I have one complaint, it's the adjustment in approach from N. In N and N++ you have gold which you can collect to extend your forever-reducing timer. In N, you had to go out of your way to collect gold to give yourself enough time to complete episodes (sets of 5 levels). The only question was on which level you were going to divert to make sure you had enough time for later levels. In N++, you can complete every episode (that I've played so far -- including several in E, the toughest category) without worrying about the timer. You collect lots of gold easily on your way round, and you never have to worry about the time. The gold is just if you want to get a high-score. I can understand that this is a new approach: always completable but you can go back for high scores, but it means an episode is just an independent set of 5 levels. I miss the tension that the timer added in N.  Still, recommended if you like games that kill you brutally every 2.3 seconds, but after one button press you're up and running again. This time, you can avoid that mine. This time, you can jump over the missile. This time, you got killed by a machine gun. But next time, next time was the mine. Then past the mine, but killed by the missile. Then the mine again. Then the machine gun once more. Next time though, next time...",

Now PC and PS4 get to expearience the hair pulling and enjoyable torment of 2004's N. Brimming with content, this PC port of the last N game will keep you entertained for years, with a packed single player 'campaign' (includes maps from N and N+) and user levels that just won't stop coming. And thats not all, folks! Lets not forget the friendship building co-op and the friendship ending race and survival modes!!  The sad thing is that, even though we have level sharing theres STILL no online multiplayer, but in the eyes of N that doesn't matter. Now, lemme ask you a question.

The gameplay is crisp as ever, with enemies that will confuse and frustrate you, despite their elegant simplicity. You will cry. You will uninstall. But perhaps, if you are strong enough, you will beat N++.  It's a simple platformer, with no 'lives' or 'hearts' or convoluting mechanics to forgive sloppy play. You beat 5 levels in 90 seconds, then you move to the next 5 levels. There is no RNG. There is no wombo combo. There is only you, with three buttons, and a decision to make.
