            "review_text": "  Decent game. The artwork and the music were beautiful. The length of the title was fine as well. I was hoping to see multiple puzzles for each country but they stuck with one per country. The price vs length of the game is about appropriate. Decent four hour gaming session with little to no distractions. Some of the levels were ranked 4/5 stars difficulty but they should have been 2/5. The difficulty the devs assigned to the levels don't seem accurate. Other than that I couldn't find anything wrong with it. Devs need to come out with more puzzle games or even add more content into this one.",
