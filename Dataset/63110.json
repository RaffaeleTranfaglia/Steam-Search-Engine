            "review_text": "A very good game with great graphic style. The gameplay based on the classic click'n'point interaction and almost all puzzles are inventory based. The voiceovers are all fine except Tim who sounds a bit... dull. Almost all his voiceovers are done in the same tone so it sounds a bit out of place at some points.  The game will be easy for any player that usually plays these type of games and you can easily finish it in 5-7 hours. The story is good - it starts slowly but it picks up later with all the murders. Even though I've read most of the reviews for this game, and even though they all gave it a pretty bad score - the game really is good.  However - the end of the game is really rushed. It does make sense, but the way it's presented is far from what it should be for this type of game. Also - you'll spend the last 30min of gameplay just going from location to location in a very speedy way because (i guess) devs ran out of time or money to make it interactive. The story at that point just rushes up till the point where the detective literally explains everything to you, what was really going on and who was behind the murders. The bad thing about it is that most of the info was never present in the game, or was mentioned very vaguely.  All in all - it's a good game and I recommend it to all adventure lovers",

For the die-hard-old-fashioned adventure gamers this one's too easy. No difficult puzzles or intricate inventory combinations that might have kept you on your toes. The ending is a bit boring, clearly set up for a sequel which was never made (at least I haven't been able to find it anywhere on internet). I'd rate this average to poor if I had to pay full price, but since I got it for a low price it was nice and gets my thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "I just finished the game, I just can not express how much sad I am about that ending. This game was just a masterpiece in bringing interesting characters, very realistic I would say. Just play it for yourself. It is very good game with a lot to discover, X chapters to be exact. Dialogues are incredible. You are playing for two characters at each chapter alone as storytellers themselves you play your way through. This game just was so good I had to finish it as the mystery was taking the place all around. And you will see that it is going to turn out into more over your control game, even though you can manage to proceed through incredible experience and just stay focused on what they say. You may play through whole game without tips or walkthrough, just try every item on everything and everyone. You will progress into another areas, into more trouble, even though you are trying to solve the problems of your character, to me it seems, that they both overcomplicate everything and worry too much about safety and try not to make mistakes they surely can not avoid as everything is pretty much planned and they just do as any good person would do. I must say that the characters you will have power over will be totally different (maybe Alter Ego), though they are two different bodies and are totally different. Those two are shown on the official picture of the game. Well, I can not say other, than just buy it, play it, enjoy the cutscenes and details put to the graphics and storytelling and mysteries that are sometimes scary, and you might also laught at few puns but mostly it is as serious as you may imagine any dark game. I still can not finish, this game just got me in few hours, I would like to continue playing. Well it is kind of open ended, well at least I hope, compared to the story of this game, you might think it has some other end than what you might see and more happy about it. As I mentioned in the beginning. I am so surprised by that ending, though from the start and throughout I expected something like that, especially Chapter IX is a big drama, I can not say any more. It just got me into heart. On the downside, the animations are not perfect, when talking to others, even you are not speaking, or other person, they open mouth, and sometimes animations skip to another without smooth movements, but why worry about it. Nothing that annoys, there is a lot more that makes this game good. I read other neutral good comments, well, it seems to them like cheap piece but for me it is one of the adventure games that do not frustrate and do not bring you to totally difficult logical puzzles, instead they focus on the simple story (good vs. evil, or victim vs. muderer) and there is not much of an opportunity to do things differently. The characters themselves are very intelligent and speak to themselves which gives you some clues what they really think, so you might understand that the problem is not over and they want to dig deeper. Especially the second character you are introduced to is the one who likes the order, the first one is more spontaneous. Alter Ego probably means these two characters have good and evil sides, not that they are both the same, as they are totally different types of personallity. Though, as you play for them, you may feel sympathy, you also know from dialogues about them and their past, so you know they are totally not so angellic, but I could not say that you are playing for the bad guys, they just act badass.",

            "review_text": "Just finished Alter Ego today and decided to do a quick review of this 19th century England murder mystery pont-and-click adventure. In short, I would only recommend to get this game if it's on sale, as even for the current price (9,99 euros), you won't get much bang for your buck.  The pros: + Decent graphics, albeit perhaps a bit sub-par for 2010; good visual atmosphere + Decent sound acting + Switching between two main characters and their different viewpoints on the world is a nice touch; both characters really have their own, unique personality, which comes through quite well + The notebook feature of the detective (although this and his other utensils could've been elaborated on more to give the game an even more crime-solving touch)  The cons: - Short gameplay (I finished it in ~10 hours) - Meagre diaglogues, it seems like they only put in the bare necessities for the game to be playable - Easy puzzles (I can count the times I really got stuck for a while on the fingers of one hand; the 'puzzles' mainly involve 'pick up item A and use it with B', 'show item C to person D', 'talk to person E to trigger event F', and, in the more challenging parts 'combine item G with item H and then use it with I') - Few locations (the summary says there are more than 80, but that's only the different SCREENS; all in all, there's only 10 different locations all around town, and the number of locations that your current main character can visit is only a small subset of that at any given time) - Pretty linear, almost railroaded gameplay; which is really a result of the 2 items above; you don't really have many different options on any of the screens / locations and there's only so many locations to visit and people to talk to in the first place; of a really decent adventure game, I expect a few dozen locations in a 'free-roaming' world and some real crunching about what to do, where to go and whom to talk to, but that's simply not the case here - At some times, especially near the ending of the game, gameplay was reduced to simply clicking on one or two things and then go from cutscene to cutscene - During the game, you have a 'who dunnit?' feel for quite some time (which is good), but in the end , the game pretty much tells you the plot at a point, and throws it all in your lap just like that, which left me feeling bereft of the opportunity to figure it all out by myself - At some points, you need to trigger exactly the right dialogue or need to use the exact right item to the exact right person before the game allows you to progress (i.e. before new dialogue options with other characters come available or before you can use certain items in a certain way), which, at times, can be a bit frustrating  All in all, the cons sadly outweigh the pros by that much that I can't really recommend this game. Not that it's totally bad (it kept me mildly entertained for a few hours), but there's simply better point &amp; click adventure games here at Steam for roughly the same price.",
