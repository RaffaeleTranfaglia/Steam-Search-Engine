            "review_text": "I REALLY have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea why I decided to go through with playing this game, I guess just for the little bit of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ humor I get from playing a game meant for kids about a decade or so younger than me. Let me tell you about Freddi Fish 3.  It's not a bad game for kids. It really is not, but there are still defining flaws, some of them are issues with the entire franchise I've found.  On the positive side we have that this game allows for a lot of exploration, but not too much, just enough that a child can wrap his/her mind around the environment, which you have to do to gather up the dirt on the suspects so that you'll know who stole the golden pipes at the end. It's a fun little meander through a bouncy, colorful aquatic environement, and while I feel the pixelly graphics look and feel very dated; I didn't mind it one bit playing this game as a kid.  On the negative side we have... well the gameplay. At times doing the stupid chores that this game throws out gets horribly dull, especially when you figure out it leads to nothing but a minigame or nothing but an extra feature. (I'm looking at you, Carnival.) Although I might be thinking too adult here, as I do know Children can be very easily distracted but still very entertained by extra features and minigames, but I myself, even as a child got a little peeved when I found out doing work was for naught.   All in all, it's a neat little game, a little short, a little dull and a little dated, but it's not bad. It has extra features like the minigame, the organ that makes cow sounds and watching Luther go through 'The Terrific Tumble Tubes' that make the game feel a bit more lively. It's still not a perfect kid's game, but it's okay, I enjoyed it as a kid, I just don't think I'd play it again.",

            "review_text": "Like other edutainment games developed by Humongous, Freddi Fish 3's value lies solely in whether or not you played it as a kid. There's certainly a nostalgic value here, however, it's not by any means as good as you remember it. The writing is very plain and dialogue is delivered very slowly and overly well-annunciated; the polar opposite of Pajama Sam's witty pop culture references and smoothly-delivered dialogue. The puzzles in these kinds of games have never been challenging, but in FF3 they're very limited. It can only be assumed that this game was intended for a much younger audience.  To sum it up, don't buy this unless you played it as a kid, and even then don't expect the sugar-coated memories to make this any better. Except for the cop fish that eats donuts.",

            "review_text": "Ok so I played this game with my father when I was 2 or 3 and I had a clunky, sleek grey computer with Windows Xp and this time period of my life when I would play games with my dad, not only bonded us closer, but it also influenced my life. It was the first REAL game I ever played and I have such vivid memories about this game. My father says he remembers me so excited to play this game, and how early I would wake up just to play Freddi Fish and how happy this game made me. The memories I think, is what impacts me the most. These memories give me flashbacks which invigorate me, which in turn brings aspiration, which then fills me with DETERMINATION. This game sparked my imagination as a young child and I have never had so much love for a game ever, period. And if you just happen to be scrolling by and you read this review and you think in your head 'Oh this game? This game is for babies.' Well you are just simply wrong, and I am raw proof of this game being rated “E for Everyone”  I have just revisited this game 12 years later (I am currently 14) and there is nothing, and I mean nothing more comforting in this world than such an underwater coral reef with comforting voice actors to soothe you as a toddler, it makes you feel as if you are in another dimension and it is so soothing it’s just ohhhhhhh. To be honest when I played this game as a baby I actually thought I was fast asleep, dreaming because of how comforting it was. That might be a big reason why you see most babies these days glued to smartphones, who's to say they feel any differently? I bet I can prove that they feel overwhelming comfort because they are stimulating their young brains. Anyway, all these colors, voices, quests, with little things you can click on, and the comfort that is provided alongside all these is why you find 'Freddi Fish 3: The Case of the Stolen Conch Shell' playable by all ages. I might be alone with all these feelings connected to this game…but I have these feelings of nostalgia towards this game and I’m sure you have a game that you feel the same way about as well and if that doesn’t convince you enough to play this game, then you aren’t human.",
