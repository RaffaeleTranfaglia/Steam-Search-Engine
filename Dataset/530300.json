    "description": "Slymes is a 3D multiplayer arena cell-game. It is inspired by games like agar.io and Osmos, but with a focus on exploring a plethora of unique maps and interacting with the world around you. As a Slyme, you must absorb small blobs to grow massive enough to trample your insignificant but oh-so-tasty opponents.",
