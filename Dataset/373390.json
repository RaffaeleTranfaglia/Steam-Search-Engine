            "review_text": " Being a detective is not an easy job to do especially when you find more questions than answers. Your goal is to interview the people and search for the clues to make them together into one piece of evidence. Step after step get deeper into strange behaviour and rituals that occurs at nearest business training course building. There is more than meets the eye, but it's hard to tell what exactly is going on and every suspect act suspicious enough so it's hard to tell who is lying. To progress with the plot we search for the contradictions and stand them side by side to confront with suspect. Acting is the main part that will drive the story, add some mystery music and we are set. Contradiction is hard, but it also gives a nice involving story. The Ending makes a good opening for the sequel.",

            "review_text": "There is a certain level of charm exclusive to FMV games. I hated them back then, but now they're all endearing in their own special way. With the computer graphics of today, we can achieve practically anything. That really isn't as exciting as it used to be. Maybe I'm just getting old. I'd probably start yelling at clouds, but I never go outside. Whatever the case, Contradiction - Spot the Liar! is a great example of what the medium is capable of.  Detective Inspector Jenks is tasked with solving the mysterious death of a young woman. Over the course of a single night, he will collect evidence, interview suspects, and discover contradictions. In terms of game-design, the process isn't complicated in any way. Take the Phoenix Wright series for example. In those games, your primary method of progression is tied to spotting contradictions. If you mess up, you're punished with a loss of 'life'. There are no punishments for mistakes in this game. You can even take as much time as you need to solve the mystery. I appreciate the more casual approach to this investigation. Due to my cautious nature, I tend to save every couple minutes in the Ace Attorney games, which really hurts the pacing.   An aspect that I really enjoy about this game is it can feel like nothing is really happening. I compare it to the Gene Hackman movie 'The French Connection'. If you take out the car/L-train chase and the shoot-out at the end, you're left with nearly an hour and a half of 'boring' police work. A lot of attention is paid to the characters, and how their mostly fruitless investigation plays out. You'll go through a similar process in this game. With every new piece of evidence, you'll end up asking everyone what they might know about it. Some won't know anything at all, but you're still treated to an answer. The person you're questioning might also make an odd quip or comment. Even if they don't have anything to do with the investigation, these character moments add a lot of personality.   That's why I strongly suggest that - unless you're well and truly stuck - you don't use a guide for this game. Aside from spoiling the answers, you're also taking away the immersive qualities of this game. A lot of the detective work in this game could be considered dull, but that's usually how it goes in the real world. Often the evidence won't consist of something significant like a murder weapon or a fingerprint. In any case, since you're essentially working to solve this mystery in a single night, you won't have access to a bunch of CSI gadgets. All you really can do is think about what everyone tells you, and weed out the red herrings.  This game was made on a budget of 3,000 pounds. 3,000! The more I think about it the crazier it sounds. Some of the voice recordings sound a little off, and the 'night' scenes were filmed in the day-time, but otherwise there's nothing that really stuck out as cheaply done. The acting is fine as well, though you're liable to remember Rupert Booth's (Jenks) 1,001 facial expressions most of all. He makes even the most banal scenes amusing.   Definitely give this game a look, especially if it's already in your library.

The central mechanic of finding inconsistencies in people’s stories works pretty well. It’s so much more enjoyable than QTEs, minigames or the typical adventure game thing of collecting random items and combining them in weird ways.  The one thing I didn’t like is the way you have to keep revisiting the same locations over and over again just to see if anything has changed. This repetitive process pads out the length of the game considerably.  Two of the hardest contradictions to spot (for me) were at the very end of the game, so I’d say it’s pretty well balanced difficulty-wise. By the way, if you do get badly stuck, but don’t want to cheat, I’d recommend rewatching the cutscenes: at least two of the contradictions rely on remembering minor details you could have easily forgotten about if you’re not playing the game in one sitting.",

            "review_text": "Full motion video was quite the rage for a brief time in the mid 90's. Outside of Tex Murphy though few developers got it right. Contradiction brings back everything that was good about FMV gaming while avoiding most if not all of its negatives. For a low budget game this has very good acting and a fairly polished and easy to use interface. There is just something very appealing about getting to play the detective and this story has a lot of interesting clues and sub plots that keep you driving to a solution. The basic gameplay premise works very well. Collect clues, interview subjects and spot contradictions in their testimony. This is much more challenging than you would think as you end up with a large amount of testimony from several suspects throughout the 7 to 8 hour experience and finding the contradictions as you get towards the end can be very challenging. You also end up with a large number of red herrings that can distract you from what is important in the information you uncover. There are a couple of hint systems available in the game, but it's very satisfying to work through the testimony on your own to find the solution.  Pros: HD quality video and solid acting Smooth interface that is easy to navigate once you get the key commands down. Backtracking is helped by map that allows you to quickly return to locations Very interesting mystery that keeps you pushing towards the solution  Cons: Audio is a bit over compressed causing it to be tinny. Hopefully this is fixed in a later update. Story ends with many of the subplots unresolved, but open to a possible sequel.  Controller support broken on Windows currently.   You will have to backtrack and speak to suspects over and over as you unlock more clues. This part does have some of the downsides of old 90’s games, but I enjoyed Inspector Jenks so much I didn’t mind and was willing to overlook this. Also, over the course of the many in game hours of interviews the suspects will mostly be in the same places. Drinks will stay the same level and suspects will stare into the same fireplaces. This can take you a bit out of the experience, but I’m sure all the dialog was recorded at the same time and this was necessary for the game design.  Overall this is one of the best FMV and Mystery titles ever made and is quite the achievement on the very small budget the game was made with. I can only hope the game does well enough to make a sequel possible. Game is well worth the asking price.",

The performances from all the actors are very enjoyable and I thoroughly recommend this game to all. In terms of sheer value for money, this is worth every penny. I hope there are several sequals here - the mechanic of the contradictions you find in the video clips was novel and I would love to see this further developed in a future release. In short - this game is highly captivating, the mechanics are deeply rewarding and it sticks in your mind long after finishing.",

            "review_text": "This was really a ton of fun. I was a bit wary at first because I was afraid you wouldn't really be doing very much actual playing, but the contradictions are so fun to dig out and it always feels like an accomplishment to exult in when you catch someone in a lie. It really is one of the best games I've played this year and it has left me satisfied but still wanting more. I'm very excited to see a sequel.  It does have its weak points, but most mystery plots do. You will find yourself yelling at characters to notice things that seem so obvious but they totally ignore. But if it can happen to Sherlock I can forgive them a bit. It did not take away from the enjoyment for me at all.  The acting is spot on. If you like British television, especially their mysteries, or really any sort of whodunnit style entertainment then this will be right up your alley. It has all the intrigue with a hint of the macabre lurking around every corner. There are campy characters who you will find yourself laughing out loud at constantly and ones with such gravitas that you actually find yourself shrinking back in your seat in intimidation.  So yeah, this is well worth the $10 and the 6-8 hours of your time for a playthrough. I would not say there is much in terms of replay value, but I did finish with 96% completion and am really curious to see what I missed. I would love for them to allow you to go back and conduct interviews after the finale just so you can try to find that elusive contradiction.",

These full video games had emerged eons ago with the CD storage but quickly died because of being terribly expensive to film and because the CD storage wasn't good enough; videos weren't compressed or anything and quickly filled a cd with barely anything. 5 CDs games were legions and were quickly hated for being cumbersome and annoying to use. Now thanks to a better technology the videos won't rip your eyes out as they did in the past (interlaced mode videos were deadly! ^^) and they can feature more than one hour of filming. And with the digitalized era, we don't have to fiddle with the numerous CDs or DVDs or anything anymore; a couple of clicks on Steam and you're set! Yes, a game all filmed is terribly kitsch but it will have better characters - you do relate more to human beings than to pixels after all.   Contradiction have a good story, even though it's rather classical it's really well told and unfolded brilliantly. It has good characters and the gameplay of spotting the contradictions is quite effective and fun! Of course it will be a bit harder for non-English native players but it's still doable - if I did it, anyone can lol. The music is good. The game settings slowly going from day to night is clever and effective. The game lasted 7 hours and it was really a fun ride!  In the forum the dev talked about making another similar game, I can't wait! More, please!!",

            "review_text": "What a great wee gem of a game. The original generation of FMVs are a bit before my time, but I understand that the tech often didn't live up to the ambition. Well, that one's more area where grasp has now caught up to vision. The video works beautifully with well-chosen angles and smooth movement between shots. The characters are well-cast and well-rounded - it feels like an interactive BBC drama - and the contradiction game play works really well. The setting feels genuinely eerie and tense without being heavy-handed, and the ominous atmosphere only built as the sun went down (lovely touch, by the way). It's challenging enough to cause some head-scratching without becoming completely frustrating (see the Steam walkthrough if you need it - the cheats function doesn't appear to work). The game's plot kep me guessing, tying the main investigation up at the end while creating an intriguing world that I hope will be built upon in further installments.  There are a couple of things Pneuma could do to improve. Auto-playing the prologue video when the game starts would help set the scene for the player. As it is currently, you just land in front of the pub feeling a little confused. A run through of the controls at the start would also benefit the game. I was told to use the 'investigation' and the 'inventory' buttons by text boxes, however, there had been no explanation what these were ('s' and 'enter'). That said, there are control instructions on the Menu screen so it's easy enough to figure out. Going back to the Prologue Video, there's a fair bit of unnecessary exposition. In the next game I'd cut this down to scene-setting only and let the game do the rest of the work (which it does, very well). Last point, a couple of the scenes where Jenks attempts to assert his authority felt a little silly. A bit more research into police descalation techniques would help remedy this.   All of the above are just suggested improvements and don't detract from the fact that I enjoyed playing this game a lot. So much so, I completed it in a single sitting (lovely way to spend Sunday). I look forward to returning to the world of Contradiction and finding out more about the clandestine workings of the Atlas Institute.",

You've got an evening to solve the mystery of a girl's apparent suicide in a small English village. You do this by wandering around talking to the various characters available to you, and picking the contradictions in their accounts, while gathering evidence where you can. It's a streamlined process, and the fact that the video is such high quality makes it all very slick - once you get used to the controls.  The couple downsides are the slightly inconsistent audio quality, and the slight drop off of the story towards the conclusion - but these are small quibbles.

While I enjoyed Her Story, it was rather bare bones with only one actress and one location. Contradiction fleshes out this concept with a full cast and a realistic English village for the player to explore. While the game isn’t scary, there exists a sense of foreboding throughout the town, I absolutely loved the atmosphere. The acting in this game is very well done, whoever was responsible for the casting nailed it on all counts.   This game is probably best played in no more than 2 or 3 sittings while everybody’s answers are fresh in your mind. I got stuck a few times, but that was because halfway through the game I took a few days off and forgot what I saw and what people told me.   The gameplay mechanic gets a bit unweildly the end of the game as there are rather extensive lists to question people with. I would have at least liked to have seen the one time use items removed from the inventory after they served their purpose. I really liked the three tier hint system. If you click the hint button, your will be given a minor hint telling you if you missed anything obvious. For more substantial help, you can always call the chief and he will give you more pointed guidance. (Even though you never see him, I thought the chief was a great minor character as he exasperatedly explains himself over the telephone.) And if you are really stuck, there is a cheat button in the main menu which tells you exactly where to go and what to do.  I’m glad developers like this are starting to try FMV games again, they really look and feel much better than they used to, with good acting, crisp imagery and seamless transitions without load times.

It is like he is trying to act in a mocking way in order to irritate the people he interogates.  Like Shenmue III, the game was done through crowd funding and it is impressive the amount of detail and depthness they went through with such a small budget - that is the magic of Indie development! The love that independent developers have for their creations is something that someone who only wants to make a quick buck by making a next generic sequel of a generic First Person Shooter or something.

The acting is still as amazingly cheesy as it was decades ago but the shots of course look way nicer than before.  I give this a recommendation although I have two major complaints:  1) This will be familiar to players of the Ace Attorney series. Throughout the game you spot contradictions and facts that just don't add up, but you're sadly restricted to point out the contradictions the game wants you to spot at the appropriate times. The game would hugely profit if there was a way to give more freedom to the players and their own wits. Ways to actually FAIL, different ways to tackle the same problem and things like that.  2) Mild spoiler alert. People who want to buy the game should stop reading here.  The game sets a lot of conflict up and admits itself that Jenks has only scratched the surface of what is going on in the story. This of course stirs the appetite for a sequel but the problem is, that it really devalues the game as a whole. The payoff of the whole murder mystery is quite meager compared to the huge setup(s) which might leave some players dissatisfied at the end.",

The story was pretty interesting, the characters pretty unique, and I couldn't stop thinking about the game once I started playing.  The ending felt a little weak, and it left some unanswered questions.  I would 100% buy another game like this for around $10-$15.

The contradiction system works superbly 90% of the time, the characters are deep and varied, and new locations open up all the time.  Some will say that the game doesn't hand out enough clues. I'll say this is patently false. On top of the hint system, players can call the Chief, and even get flat-out cheats to help them along when needed. The ever-increasing amount of conversation points also means that the amount of answers to verify grows as well -- but that just means you can't be expected to simply throw statements at one another hoping they will stick. One has to fully remember everything to get around in Contradiction.  The most disheartening thing I have seen regarding this game is the Rock Paper Shotgun review for it. By saying the game should directly tell the players when new events are available at locations, when contradictions are left to be made -- and with whom -- the author only put his inability to appreciate freedom on display. TellTale's The Walking Dead this is not. This is very much a game, and not an interactive story. The only valid point that review brought forth is the game's technical shortcomings; it is true that the lack of resolution options is jarring, and the general UI and presentation is odd at first. But not only is it absolutely not a deal breaker, I feel like it kind of gave the game a very distinct, simple vibe. It was never distracting or frustrating. It took me a couple of minutes to get used to it, then I never gave it a thought again.  Really, for all fans of classic, hardcore adventure games, looking for a modern take (in terms of presentation) on the classic genre, Contradiction is a gift from the Gods. Do not hesitate. Do not watch trailers. Do not try to know anything about it, except that it is a great, great game. Just dive in, headfirst. You'll thank me!",

Simon always appears to be in a bright afternoon kitchen even at 11:00 PM. And Inspector Jenks doesn't have a mobile phone but has to return to a pay phone.  Having the next sequel end with one of the classic mystery wrap ups where you have everyone in the same room and reveal the actual murderer would cost a lot because you would have to record many different video takes that would not be used.

This game was like a breath of fresh air - good concept - very well implemented with good script and slick editing for modest cast - quite fun - best tried with friends or family together with output to TV screen - occasional rare minor interface bugs but easily overcome - some scenes and acting quirky and quaint but all the funnier for that - there is enough for a couple of evenings or one very long one - would fit in with a weekend effort with friends or family nicely.   Was very happy to forgive any minor shortcomings of this game because overall the effort and polish of what was attempted was accomplished very impressively; it is not easy to script, edit, act out and film such a work so well - the developers have done a good job on this - appreciate it and I hope you will enjoy this interactive TV detective show as much as we did.   I picked it up when on a heavily discounted price tag and found it great value entertainment - I don't often review games but this delivered what I was expecting and was fun - deserves support, success and sequels.",

This is, despite having its plot unfolding around a murder, a comedy narrative as each character delivers some hilarious dialog. The only complaint I have is that at times I wasn't completely sure what to do next so I had to stumble around attempting to put things together (and even if I had figured something out Jenks still may be behind logically). This is a pretty standard complaint for adventure games, however the fact that every piece of info is there in the menu means that obsolete info or items remain despite having no further function... minor complaint though as I wanted to see more of Jenks. I hope the cast returns for a sequel as this game really builds towards an interesting world I'd love to see more of.",

Also, the actors are great in their roles and the story gets interesting really fast. There is a hook for a sequel at the end, but the main story concludes in a satisfactory manner.   Pros: - Really well acted and directed FMV adventure game. Decent soundtrack, too. It's incredible that all this was accomplished on a short budget. - Interesting way of navigating around the locations. - Virtually no pixel hunting. - The UI helps a lot in order not to get stuck - and if you use up hints and chief calls and still don't have clue, there is also a 'cheat' system to power through your predicament.  - It is not really a short game, or at least doesn't feel like it. It takes its time and you get to meet and get to know most of its (multiple) characters quite well.   Couple of drawbacks: - The gameplay is mostly backtracking over locations to interrogate/ ask questions based on new info you discover. However, there is a three-level hint system integrated in the game that assures that you will never get stuck - 1 or 2 of the (several) contradictions that you are required to spot seemed a bit far fetched.  A definite recommendation from me to anyone who enjoys FMV adventures.",

Paul Darrow gives a brilliant performance as the sinister Paul Rand--the sort of character you love to hate. The story was a bit strange, but this kept things interesting. My only real complaints are:  1) the game mechanic in which you must spot the contradiction from the same character--this became a bit of a frustration in that you might spot a contradiction between two characters but be unable to pursue it. 2) Once you start, don't plan on doing anything else for the next twelve hours.  I recommend this game. It's a bargain.",

You progress the story by walking between locations in a sort of Google Maps fashion, and interviewing the characters you find in the hopes of making them contradict themselves. The overall feeling is one that players in the UK will recognize if I say 'weekend evening ITV murder mystery'. It's a police procedural that has more in common with Poirot than The Bill.  The core mechanic gets a bit wobbly once you're a couple of hours in, because the list of available topics is so long that it's impossible to hold it all in your head at once, and spotting contradictions is a matter of scrolling up and down the list, reading off each point at a time until something you spot something. And them hoping that the game recognizes it as a contradiction, because not every instance of contradictory text is necessarily something that will move the game forward.  It's charming in setting and cinematography, and the acting is winningly hammy, so the niggles with the problem-solving fade away, especially since a lot of it is easy enough that you can just keep propelling the story forward.

The pleasure was akin, but not as rich, to playing the good old Phantasmagoria 2. (By the way, if you liked Contradiction, you may love this one.) Halas, troubling is the fact that the game ends with a promise of a sequel, which is necessary regarding the many loose ends... though comments from the developer on the forum remain vague and conditional on the subject. What is he waiting for? People who played the game are begging to throw money at crowd-founding for this project. And why not?

The last two sessions I played of this were simply because I was pot commited and I wanted to see how the story ended. It's hard for me to articulate why exactly I dislike this game without some degree of spoiling but I won't so don't worry.   The tragedy of this game is that the start showed such promise and the writing was solid. But by the end of the game the lack of technical polish and writing chops is so visible to be painful. It tears me up to be this negative because i'm sure this was put together by a passionate group of good folks. But the eponomous Contradictions range from vaguely clever to unbelievably convoluted and obtuse. Further the climax and final chapter is contrived to the point of being laughable. Characters suddenly do things for no reason and the ultimate reveal is so anti-climactic but is played straight to the point of mellow drama.  To put it concisely this game ran out of something, I don't know if it was money, or time, or patience. But this bears all the signs of someone setting out for something much grander, but then having it all collapse and having to build something workable out of the ashes. A noble effort, but do not waste your time like I wasted mine.",
