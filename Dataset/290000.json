A newer update completely changed the game for me, and has made it more frustrating than fun.  For example: first level is insanely hard to beat, even on the easiest difficulty I could find. There is just way more going on than there was before it was changed. Honestly, a casual mode should be really easy and that's all I expect. Because of this change, I feel as if the game was a waste of money and time and will no longer have a place on my machine.  For those who enjoy a challenge, I say go for it. For those who just want a time killer, and don't like listening to the same song three times in a row, take your money elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "I really hate to give this game a negative review, but it really didn't deliver what I wanted. There are three main points I want to adress that would improve the game.  1) Feedback from the screen. In this game, the music only controlls the character... Thats it. There is no system put in place that controlls screen effects (such as screen shake or motion blur) enemy patterns, or color changes. In music games, you need the full experience, this only has it partially done.  2) Design. This game in my opinion is lazily put togeather. Each stage is a square in which you fight in. There are no walls exept for on the outside, and it is the same size in every level. Not only that, but the enemy design in all over the place, but very condenced at the same time. In each stage, you will see the same 3-5 enemy types over and over. And it changes every level. None of them are the same stage to stage, but they are really repetitive in the ones they are in.  3) The upgrade system is horrible. If you are someone who wants to get the best ship they can by the end of the game, this game is not for you. The upgrades are level to level, and not permanite. This means that if you want to grind for levels, it's only going to give you points on the level you are on. This is understandable if you think of it in the way that they don't want you to farm for a long time, but not get so over-powered that you can beat every level first try, but it still doesn't make sence after that. Not only this, but upgrades change nothing on the visible ship. You can get as many upgrades as you like, but your ship will stay the exact same all the way. Although this is a minor detail, it still annoys me on a low level.  Alright, now that all the bad things are there, lets list some good ones.  1) There is controller support. I always find this to be a plus because it encourages more casual gaming. It also makes the movement a whole lot easyer.  2) The bullets and music fit togeather very well. There might not be much else with the music, but when the bullets shoot, I can really see it fitting with the music in every way. This also leads me to something else that could be improved - quiet points in music. Whenever you are going throgh a build up, or the start of the song, it has no aspects that help you shoot. Everything stops, and you are left up to your doging skills. This is very annoying, and partially ruins the gameplay.  So, this is a good game. Would I recommend it? No. At least not for this price. If you are wanting to try this game, I would recommend getting it from a place like ♥♥♥ or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or just wait for a sale.  So, final words. This game is a good concept, but it was not made in a way that satasfies.",

            "review_text": "This is the kind of thing that Indie games can do and hit it out of the park. Rhythem games are at there most compelling when it feels like your actions are in tune with the music, and rather then simply timeing a button press, this involves adding another layer of complexity in the form of weaponry and shot placement. You may actually understand music a little better after playing. And it isn't a 1 trick pony. the art style is unique, imaginative, and varies wildly. Theres a sense of movement and scale that constantly changes. I can see playing this game for a couple of minutes, or obsessively for hours, and having a constant stream of reward and feedback to keep you going. I'm very impressed, and keep finding myself literally laughing out loud when the beat drops.",

            "review_text": "  Note that I did get this product for free from a Lootcrate code.  I will admit that going into the game at first I did not have high expectations. It looked like just another 'your music controls the game' type experience. I was surprised, however, when I played for the first time-- and it should say something that only ten minutes of play time, the amount I currently have, would be enough to convince me to write a review-- I was surprised by some of it's content.  Pros: Easy controls Sick music Nice graphics Did I mention sick EDM? Easy upgrade system  Cons: No tutorial, though it is pretty easy to get the hang of. Some things go unsaid. For example, you are never told that the blue WiFi looking symbols are actually the things you used for upgrades (named 'Wubs'). Keep that in mind your first time playing.  In conclusion, this game is a good addition to your library, assuming you aren't epileptic or short on cash.",
