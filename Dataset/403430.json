            "review_text": "Great game, terrible port.  I love Galaga, but this port needed more work.  - Controllers\\Joysticks not officially supported, and only kinda work  I tried using an Xbox 360 controller and it did work. However there's no joystick deadzone, so if your joystick isn't PERFECTLY centered at rest then you'll be unable to control your ship properly.  Come on, who forgets to put decent joystick support in an arcade game?  - Can't rebind keyboard keys   Just...why?   - Poor fullscreen support  Full screen isn't an option in the display settings, but you can make the game fullscreen by pressing ALT+Enter. If you do that however, you won't be able to quit the game without pressing ALT+F4 to close it or by taking it out of fullscreen with ALT+Enter to bring back the X in the upper right corner.  - Doesn't work well in Steam Big Picture mode  This is related to the above point and again, this is something that does work with fiddling. It just doesn't work like it should.   If you put the game in fullscreen mode with ALT+Enter, then close the game it will open in fullscreen next time you open it. If you do that before starting Big Picture mode then the game will start in full screen on your TV. However since there's no quit button inside the game you'll have to use Big Picture's 'Close Game' option to make the game close.  I'm using a TV set up as a second monitor. If you're using a Steam Link or Steam Box I don't know if this will work or not.",

But it turns out it is just that the options are bit convoluted. You have to cycle to full screen mode with space bar. It feels like the classic and the scanline effect is nice. Nothing to hate here. Feels good.",

It doesn't get more simple than that and I just Alt-Enter to go full screen and back. Why don't they release more of these classics without having to use some emulator? Defender? Battlezone? All of them!!   Nostalgic fun.",
