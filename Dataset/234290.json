From 1 to 10 Ill give this game a 8.5. This game is not crisis, call of duty or a aliens game so don’t compare it to such",

The only problem with it is that you really do need a controller to play it, becuase the implementation for the PC keyboard is absolutely terrible. It's doesn't really make any logical sense and changing the layout is very tedious indeed. It really does give the impression that hardly no effort went in to converting this for PC use. Shame, becuase as it is I can't recommend it unless you own a controller.",

It has good level design, some interesting platforming, and a bit of variety in combat. You upgrade your suit as you go along to make you more powerful, and unlock different abilities for the four suit types (normal, rock, fire, and ice). This gives the game a bit of a MegaMan feel to it.  Graphics and sound are good. The game runs fine on my PC with no issues. On a side note, I have read others having issues with controls, I have not. I do however use a 360 controller so I don't know what difference that may make.   All in all, if you enjoy side scrolling action games with platforming elements and a sprinkle of mega man weapon variety thrown in, pick this up.",

You'll respawn at the nearest checkpoint and there are plenty of checkpoints. You have 4 different powers. Fire, Ice, Earth Powers and your normal attacks. You'll gain stronger powers every few levels. The story is a bit weak but it's alright.  But here is the big problem which turns the review into a negative one: It's unplayabale due to crashes. A few people experienced crashes at the first level and could solve it with turning off steam ingame overlay and steam cloud for this game. Some needed to tweak the .CFG file. In my case nothing worked so far. I'm half through the game and it crashes every time at the same spot.    TL;DR",

            "review_text": "This game shows flashes of awesome, but those brief positive bits are brought down by bad controls, poor level design, and a lack of polish. The four different suit types and their different mechanics are very interesting, similar to something like Trine where the level puzzles are built around different abilities at different moments. The controls are sluggish and sometimes inconsistent. I caught my character grabbing the ledge in one case, and completely missing it when running into it in another. The enemies can move in 3D space, but you're stuck on a 2D space. That makes for some really confusing combat moments where you think you hit an enemy, but you actually didn't and take damage from them instead. Overall, it just feels like a game that could have benefitted by a good bit of polish and different design perspectives.",

Lots of cheap deaths from falling down holes that don't look like holes. It has a very hard time being stable, crashes every twenty minutes. ♥♥♥♥ poor hit detection. Controls that don't always trigger. It's an interesting concept, art style and everything...it just wasn't executed properly. Feels like a bad PS1/N64 title with higher resolution.",
