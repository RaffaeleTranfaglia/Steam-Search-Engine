Through all of that, the game is amazing. You can have great fun bombing the enemy with crabs, sending your troops on suicide runs, or surviving against waves and waves of enemies assaulting your base, with your gold supplies dwindling and your troops dying by the second. And don't even get me started on how much mods make this game even better.  Once you get the hang of it and get past its many quirks and bugs, it's really enjoyable. The physics are good, you can destroy literally everything in the game and shoot limbs off of enemies. With certain mods the replay value can make you want to play it over and over. Note the game IS buggy and lacks a lot of polish which might err some people.",

I believed the latest vid from the developer, stating that a lot of previous issues have been fixed etc, and so picked it up for $6 in a steam sale, but to be honest it must have been pretty bad before if this is supposed to be significantly improved.   It definitely has potential: the combat could be fun if it wasn't so unbalanced, and the destruction/debris is nice.   The split-screen mode is one of the main reasons I picked it up. A friend of mine who loves quirky indie games was coming over for the evening and this looked perfect. We're used to playing a fair share of alpha/beta/unfinished Public Domain games where bugs are often part of the charm, but even this was too much for us and we gave up after about an hour. I've since played it a little more on my own to see if we missed something, but as hard as I tried I couldn't feel anything but frsutration when playing this.  If you can figure out how to work around the weird bugs, the swampy controls, and the terrible GUI, then you might like it. In the interest of fairness, I should say that I haven't tried any of the mods. I read the other reviews on here and they all seem to agree that you need to try mods to get the most out of this, but my issues were with core things like controls and the single player campaign, which I doubt any mods would address,",

            "review_text": "Simply put: Cortex command is very small. It is not a complete game, and it never will be complete. Although it isn't particularly buggy, its lack of content does not excuse its price.  This is really too bad, as it is very fun! The physics may not be realistic, but flying at high speeds across the map whilst blasting everything you see, including your own troops, with the various weapons the game offers is crazy fun. That combined with the satisfying way bodies blow apart and bleed powdery blood all over everything makes for a very promising start. Sadly, it does look like the game is dead. Pros:  -Very satisfying: Messing around with the in game modifiers and with weapons can create some interesting results, and the gore is very well done despite its simplicity. The mechanics are Cortex's strong point by far, as they offer very comical over the top explosive action that remains organic. -Surprisingly, crate bombs. Simply learning the best combinations of grenades to fill a crate with before scuttling it and blowing half the map up is very fun. Although its technically not really a feature, it was a happy accident. I wont spoil any of the different crate bomb effects, but try them out. (Just load a crate with a LOT of grenades.) -Campaign. I couldn't decide whether to make this one a pro or a con. The campaign is a fun way to add somestructure to the chaotic gameplay, but dont expect much in the ways of strategy and story. In fact, dont expect any. Take this as you may. -Factions: The factions are quite varied. Even if they do all work off of the same rules, they all do the same thing differently. The Coalition combine well rounded and armoured troops that aren't particularly expensive, with sub-par weapons. Their main advantage is their minigun drones, which, despite being practically immobile, can mow down enemies with incredible effectiveness. When used in a group, you can punch through bunker walls with streams of bullets.  Then there are the Dummies, who die in about 1 hit, are super cheap, and have better then average weaponry. Good for swarms, has good guns. Their Dreadnaught is next to useless as anything but a hallway defender.  The Ronin have better troops then the Dummies, but they still die fairly quickly. They have a heavy which will actually sustain damage and has a helmet, so I recommend using mostly heavies. Despite this, they have arguably the best guns in the game - their heavy machinegun is fantastic, their m16 packs a punch, and the RPG is basically a giant explosive sniper that one shots most things, and sends everything else flying off into the horizon.  The Techion have all the coolest guns and the most advanced stuff. Their heavy troop, instead of being beefy, never bleeds. They are light but expensive 0 very expensive. And their soldiers are overpriced. They do, however, have the most broken gun in the game. The Nucleo Swarm can kill anything from pretty much across the map.   The Browncoats are gigantic, pricy, and have okay guns.In fact, they are so heavy they dont really need guns. Just crushing people with your face will win the day. Despite this, arming every single Browncoat you deploy with a flamethrower makes for a lethal force, as that flamethrower is... Scary.  The Imperatus are not quite as heavy as the browncoats, but they have the most variety in the game. Their scout bots  are like dummies, and ought to be used like them. Good for quick deploy snipers, etc. They have an all rounder, and a heavy. Their guns focus on damage, and are thus usually unreliable but effective. Their running theme seems to be load times and single shot weapons. -Excellent semi-retrosoundtrack: It kind of feels like it should be retro, but it isn't.  -Charming: The game has a neat visual style and tang, its more then just yet another lazy pixelated 'stylized' game, it uses its pixelated style to achieve more then just a retro look, it has its own very cool sci-fi flavour. The backgrounds are well done, and the spaceships and maps do have style. Cons: -Lack of content to keep you playing: If you want to play Cortex Command for any longer then a week, I hope you like mods.  -Crazy pre game load screen: Though its not as bad when you dont download any mods, I strongly recommend you download mods, sooo... It can take up to like 5 minutes just for the game to start up with mods, which is bad. -Unbalanced: Whether or not this game really needs balance is debatable, as its more focused on action then anything. But I mentioned the Nucleo Swarm - there's more. Browncoats pretty much trump everything, and the Dummies are hopelessly underpowered, even with their devastating guns. Plus, I also mentioned crate bombs. You can win the game with them, without even paying much money. Not to mentioned, just stacking 10 soldiers with heavy weapons in one place and forming a squad will allow you to erase the map with bullets. Dropships can fly into things, killing everything, meaning you can win every game in campaign if you just kamikaze the enemy brain with your dropship at the beginning of the game. Luckily, the A.I. does not partake in such horrors, so you can just play honerably and ignore the imbalance. -Lack of strategy and skill involved: this can be forgiven for the games focus on action and stupid situations, but it is true that the game isn't hard to master. The only difficulty you'll have getting in to it is the controls (get to that in a sec), and mastery doesn't go much farther then learning how to control the jetpack and how to melee. (By flying into people at high speeds and using your face to merge them into the ground, gibbing them, spoilers.) -Controls: They are... Incompetant. Though after my time through the game (dont get me wrong, I actually love this game) I have learned them, beginners will have a hard time figuring out the questionable menu wheel. The WASD part is easy enough, though you do have to get used to the physics, (its a bit like playing octodad at first, expect to spend most of your time in the tutorial hurdling out of control) its the command wheel thats the problem. In order to do simple stuff like reload, you have to right click and release on a certain point on a wheel. This can be tedious, especially before you start to learn to do it naturally, and even after. -Terrain issues: Anyone who has played Browncoats ona snow map knows my pain - you will get stuck. A lot.  Especially when tunneling, which is a big part of this game, you will spent most of your time hopelessly trying to get you face out of that pile of dirt. Single floating pixels and stop you dead, making you have to squirm to destroy them and move on. Every unit moving like they wet themselves doesn't help, and if you dont have a jetpack, god help you.  Overall, I have a hard time recommending it at full price, BUT - do not pass this review as pureply negetive! If the game is on sale or you have extra money kicking around, its worth a weekend of hilarity and fun. Its really too bad, becuase despite its numerous issues, the game is fun to play. So if you want it, get it, but like I said, its not quite worth the money. With mods it can be pretty fun, especially the joke mods that just add stupid stuff.  I did recommend simply becuase its got too much good going for it for me to say its bad. Its not 'potential,' it is a good game as it is, it just lacks content. 6/10, worth a look, but rarely keeps you for long.",

There's also an element of creating a safe shelter to direct the operation from, as the whole fight hinges on success or failure in keeping safe one particular member of your forces.  I should also point out that in my opinion, CC is not a game about tactical fighting. Yes, you did just read me deny the majority of standing opinion. AI can be used for most battle functions that the player can direct, granted not as efficiently as a skilled cortex operator - but no AI can manage your funds. This game is about war economy. Deciding what's necessary for an attack and implementing those choices, while keeping back enough money to create a defense.

It has one of the best intros I've seen in gaming. It's a sandbox/strategy/combat game. It's very unique in its appearance and gameplay. You basically have a disembodied brain and with that single brain you can jump between and control different mechanical bodies. You then use these bodies to protect your brain and mount an attack on the enemy. The game lacks refinement but it will be interesting to see where it goes from here.",

            "review_text": "Back in my young college days there was a downloaded version of this game going around amongst my friends (I really wanted to buy it but couldn't spare even the small amount of money required). At the time it was an unfinished sandbox where you basically downloaded mods and shoot crazy guns and stuff at terrible AI that practically just stood there.  Now there's actually a game here. The campaign consists of taking and defending territories while competing with up to 3 othere AI players. You pick a place and if anyone challenges you for it you fight for it. Once you take it you can either design your own base within it, or pick a budget and let the game build one for you.   I found designing things to be a little unfriendly because i wasn't sure what everything was, and it can take a lot of time depending on how crazy you want to get. Considering that at the moment the campaign doesn't usually last a long time depending on how good you are and the settings you choose I didn't feel compelled to do it. Additionally you'll be taking over several bases over the course of the game and it would be insane to manually build each one unless you were really quick. However, the autobuilding feature of the game tends to build some pretty decent looking bases. The problem is that each day you give the computer a budget for your base and then it decides how to spend the money and in what order. This means over time the base will get better but at the beginning you might have a pretty incomplete base. When you get attacked and you have an incomplete base, it can be nearly impossible to protect.  The actual battles are where the game shines. You start with a brainbot or if you have a base he might just be a brain in a jar. He's basically your commander and if his fragile brain jar gets destroyed then its game over. I usually send him down to dig for gold while i let my other units guard him.   This game is a physics based game where each pixel acually has its own properties. Units are actually made up of connected parts that move and interact based on their physics. This means that every part of a character can be blown off and every spec of dirt or other material has its own properties that can be deformed. Bullets go through softer objects and ricochet off harder ones. Rockets all have their own forces and when they explode they shred into pieces that can effect characters around the environment.  This game is run by gold and every unit is bought and dropped into your scene through the buy menu that will let you customize the unit and what it's carrying. generally they all have jetpacks, and weight matters so you dont want to bog a guy down too much otherwise he'll get stuck a lot and won't be able to jetpack too high.  Once a unit is called down you can take control of him and use his arsenal to take out other units and hopefully their brain. This is the part thats both amazingly fun, hilarious, and sometimes frustrating. The AI has gotten pretty smart at navigating around the levels and everyone is so fragile it can get pretty difficult, but in a good way. Especially when you're outnumbered and units are getting close to your brain. Having to fend off guys while simultaneously trying to buy and call down more units can be really tense. Especially because you're always working within a changing budget. Juggling shooting things, buying things, and budgetting can be pretty crazy at times.  But the real craziness comes from the Cortex Command moments you'll experience. Blowing up dropships and having them rollover and land on top of the guys they just dropped off, then exploding is always awesome. Jetpacking out of control and then smashing into 3 enemy NPCs and watching everyone explode is hilarious. Sniping a guy from long range and watching his parts just fly off is super satifying, and if you get your hands on a rocket launcher, you're in for some serious entertainment. These moments almost never get old, and will keep you playing this game for hours on end. Even when you totally fail the simplest task and all these things happen to you, its still hilarious.   And when you get bored? There are a bunch of great secenarios and community made mods on the steam workshop that will keep the game fresh. weegee's unmapped lands 2 mod is a really great conversion of the campaign and probably more fun than the vanilla game itself. He even has his own interpretation of FTL in the CC world that's worth checking out.  I'll be honest, this game has a bit of a learning curve. In the current state I'm reviewing this game it's unfinished. The developer has admitted that all the features are in the game, they just arent polished, and thats true. There is a tutorial that does an okay job of teaching you the basics of combat and mining gold, but as far as the campaign part of the game goes, there's basically no guidance at all. The community has made up for this though.   In it's current state it's a game you can sit down and play for 15mins or 5 hours. However, you can really see the potential of the game, and it can really only get better from here on out. It's a great game to add to your collection, play until your burnt out, forget about it for a year or two, and then play it until your burnt out again. It's that solid and that evergreen. You'll never get tired of blowing things up.  Like the developer says in the video on the Store page. This game reviewed several years ago by alot of major sites in was was obviously an unfinished state. I'm not sure of the specific circumstances behind that, but this isnt the same game it was then. I'd argue it wasn't even a game then. Now it is, but still unfinished.   The message here is, don't believe the major reviews or metacritic score. Read the reviews on steam. Everyone is recommending it, just like myself.    ",

It is also very easy to tailor the games challenge level either through built in settings or choosing to challenge yourself with creative set ups.  Downsides. The game can be a bit hard on older computers as the way the engine works requires some decent power to make the game run reasonably well. Some of the cooler mods have effects and particles flying about in such quantity the game can slow to a crawl.  The mod community is normally great. The steam workshop though seems abit under populated given the overall size of the old community. Getting updated mods that work can be a bit of problem sometimes.

It won't take any new player long at all to see the lack of quality of this game and regret their purchase. In my opinion, it's a twelve year old alpha. Stay away!",

There is a health bar, but most of the time it means nothing besides a bleedout timer as you can be instantly killed by a headshot or be crushed to death by your own dropship or rocket. You can shoot off legs and arms and sometimes it can even works towards your favor, but most of the time it doesnt as you hands to even hold a gun.   Did your space rambo get both of his legs blown off and is rapidly bleeding to death? No worries, without those legs weighing you down you can jetpack much faster towards the enemies and then headbutt people to death as you fire your machinegun. But wait, as you move forward a stray piece of dropship debris hits you at 666km/h, killing you instantly. You are quickly overwhelmed by crash-test dummies with spacey nailguns and kills your disembodied brain because you spent all of that money on rambo and didnt bother investing in gold mining.
