The graphics and animations have been slightly improved along with a few minor unit improvements.  The one big reason I purchased this game is due to the fact that there is now the steam workshop added for the game, there are a lot of decent mods and maps/missions that make the game enjoyable if you dont fancy multiplayer. I cant comment too much on multiplayer as I never got into it.  Overall though the game can be enjoyable if you liked previous verisons of the game or are a fan of RTS WW2 games.",

            "review_text": "Men of War - Assault Squad 2,  Is a bit of a strange release, because the content is almost 100% the same as Men of War - Assault Squad 1. The gameplay is the same and the only thing that changed are some weapon configurations and range settings. Everything else's basically the same.  As a plus though, Men of War - Assault Squad 2 has Steam integration, something Men of War - Assault Squad 1 lacks and thus is unplayable in normal multiplayer matches due to the fact that Game Spy shut down. (You can still play multiplayer by using a program like: Hamachi, Tunggle or Game Ranger)  The most important changes, however, are not with actual gameplay, but with the engine that's being used and it's probably their engine of choice for the next game: 'Call to Arms'.  Final verdict: It's hard to tell if you should buy Men of War - Assault Squad 2 or the prequel Men of War - Assault Squad 1. If money is an issue, then go for Men of War - Assault Squad 1. Otherwise you should go for Men of War - Assault Squad 2, because it features Steam Workshop &amp; match making and runs on a more modern engine tuned towards high end systems.",

            "review_text": "Overall gamplay is good but worse than AS1. The lag and the inability to fix it since it's release is mindboggling. See strat29's comments.  Edit: The game has been updated since early October however the update has not drastically changed the game to differentiate it enough from Assault Squad 1 (AS1). It has fixed the lag issue for the most part but it seems rather strange that the game was originally launched with such a blatant, arguably unplayable issue in the first place. There are no new factions, very few new maps, inability to play the large maps (8x8 for example) and a game that essentially replicates what AS1 does. Worth a buy? Maybe. Worth the supposed upgrade from AS1? Nope.  Edit #2 (Version 3.115.0): In the last few weeks a new update and new features via a DLC were issued through steam. They've ironed out some of the issues that plagued the game since the latest series of updates but the game still has some relatively large issues that continute plague performance and multiplayer gameplay. If you're relatively new to this game and you're looking to experience multiplayer and ultimately test out your strategies, you may not have that great of a time. While many players will experience the following, it is new and casual players who will experience the following in a more frustrating fashion. Multiplayer is not 'smooth', in fact many have complained it is essentially broken. Crashing (out of sync, random black screens, random dropping) is very common. Second, lag is an issue, period. Whether the lag issue is due to bad PC performance or latency issues, it is a problem for many. Third, multiplayer often requires you to connect with other players and form regular teams which can and is often frustrating for new and casual players (although I'm quite fine :)).   A few more notes on the latest series of updates: - No 8v8.... yet? - Replay via the DLC is great but arguably a tad expensive considering what you get. Plus the replay feature does not have any control functions like pause, fast-forward, etc. Further, it is bugged.  - Spectator slots are a great addition but it is also bugged and likely causes out-of-syc crashing issues. - Steam overlay is all messed up. The latest updates have rendered it useless which is a step backwards and quite surprising that it was not looked at before the release.  - This company seems to think it's cool release release notes several days after an update.    I can definitely understand why new and casual players find the multiplayer aspect of this game frustrating. Not only is there a steep learning curve, it has a number of other issues which I noted. I should also note that the overall gameplay is still not better than AS1.  Edit #3 (Version 3.122) as of May 23rd, 2015: This game has been updated several times since I last looked over my review of this game. I would like to note the following:  - SOME Out-of-Sync in-game crashing has been fixed but it still occurs enough to delay a 2v2 tournament and was the direct cause of cancelling the 3v3 league (which I assisted in administering). It is a MAJOR sore spot in the competitive part of the community.   - Replays still crash as much as before.   - I began a campaign for new maps to be implemented in a future version given this game's focus is primarily on multiplayer. I hope this is done because this game has lacked new, quality maps ever since it's release. I have no idea why this didn't cross their minds before hand... It now appears DMS may very well be including it in a future paid DLC pack, which if true, is a joke given that the maps they're reviewing are available FREE as a MOD (unfortunately too many AS2 players are ignorant of this).  - Performance issues still exist (lag, PC performance). Still worse than AS1 in terms of performance.   - Steam overlay is still completely broken, about a year since it's release.  - Matchmaking, I finally tried it. It's been plagued with issues from day one, no end in sight. It is also not taken seriously, at all, by us in the competitive community.   Edit #4 (Latest version as of July 16th, 2015): It's been almost two months since I updated this review to outline the latest version(s) so I'd like to note a few things:  - Many people still play this game, albeit the singleplayer part of this game. Unfortunately this game, as all RTS games, is geared towards multiplayer. With that being said, the crashes I've noted early, among a new crash since the end of May and the out-of-sync errors that still occur have really hurt two communities: the more experienced modders and modding community and the competitive community. As of three weeks ago I stopped playing due to the sheer amount of errors in multiplayer and overall instability in the game's performance.   - DMS has struggled to provide a smooth, stable multiplayer ever since it's release. I've been cautiously optimistic and hopeful but I've decided to move on generally and wish everyone good luck playing the game. Out-of-sync issues has decimated larger multiplayer games and as I've noted, the competitive side of the community. It's virtually impossibly to play consistent, stable 2v2, 3v3 and up games. With that being said, It's a game that I truly enjoyed but it's become too unstable to continue forwards.",

            "review_text": "There's not that many strategy games out there nowadays and those that do come out usually end up as a disappointment because of being either too bad of a game or too simple and generic (A + Click, I win etc) with no strategy or tactic in place.  The problem with Men of War Assault Squad 2 does not fall into either of these categories. It falls into a special one   Now, when I first heard that they'll be releasing a MoW2 with Steam Intergration I was excited until I saw the price and notice that not many things changed. Paying ~$35 for the same thing is not really a good thing so I decided to buy on sale which I did. And from what I've experienced thus far, thank goodness I bought it from the sale. _______________________________________  Gameplay -------------------------------------------------------------- At it's core, MOWAS 2 is a 'what if' Company Of Heroes 2 had much more micromangement and detail involved without the base building and includes mechanics such as managing an individuals soldier, tank or artillery inventory and even ASSUMING CONTROL of them when needed to fine tune your orders such as timing a cooked grenade toss or aiming a specific part of the target etc.  Armoured Warfare in this game puts CoH2's to shame because of how each (and there's a lot) and every Tank has seperate parts which can be neutralized to decommision a tank such as destroying its mobility with a shot to its track or destroying its main gun so that it can no longer fire. Note that they can be repaired should the inventory of the tank or crew have a spare repair kit. The way tanks are destoyed in this game is also amazing as tanks do not have health but instead, rely on their armour thickness and the direction from which the AT fire came from (did it hit from a sloped angle or the rear? etc) so you won't see funny things like a Stuart destroying a King Tiger.  The gameplay in this game is solid and rather in-depth which is the main reason why I enjoy this game so much. _______________________________________  Single Player --------------------------------------------------------------  Nothing too interesting here. 7-ish missions for each of the 5 factions which are basically reskins of one another. Luckily, there are mods that add interesting scenarios and SP (or Co-op) missions of their own.  However, Single Player Co-Op has this weird mechanic where person A can buy a Tank but the game decides to give said Tank to person B because he has a smaller army count. In addition, buying a 8-man squad can end up becoming a 2-man squad as a result of this mechanic. Though units can be given away to other players, for a game that has players speaking many languges, trying to share these units can be a hard unless playing with a friend in which case it's only a minor annoyance.  SP can be fun though doing the same thing over and over again can get boring unless you use mods by individuals such as Sir Hinkel. _______________________________________  Multiplayer --------------------------------------------------------------  Alongside the weird 'sharing units in Single Player campaign' thingy, multiplayer also has a weird mechanic which although can be turned off in an unranked lobby by the host, it cannot be turned off in ranked matches, period.  Basically, its a levelling system. If I'm not mistaken, the maximum level that one can achieve is around 20 if not more. At level 20, you can purchase any units during a ranked game. At level 1 which most people start as off, you can only purchase half the units at your disposal. Basically, your low level is preventing you from making any expensive yet powerful purchases such as Elite Infantry Units, Heavier Tanks and Heavy Artillery support including half of your special faction troops being locked.  How does 1 increase their level? Two ways. Either they play (and finish) more ranked matches or play through the SP campaign either alone or with a friend.  This levelling system is in my opinion, extremely flawed for players attempting to get their feet wet in ranked multiplayer. Aside from some toxic players which most game have, going against a level 20 opponent when you're simply level 1 offers the new player a huge disadvantage for them and removes the fun for him as he will basically get rofl stomped by superior equipment. In addition to this, most players who I've met in a ranked game tend to have double digit levels while I'm still level 3 and I fail to see how this create a valid and fair leaderboard let alone match when high level players are always going up against lower tier players such as myself. To me, this seems downright broken and makes ranked matches unplayable until I've played a countless number of SP missions for a game that emphasizes on Multiplayer. This mechanic is such a major turnoff that I regret buying this game, even though it was during a deal UNLESS players start getting paired against similarly ranked or levelled players.  One thing that this game has done to avoid players from dropping is by forcing you to finish a game by removing any form of concede button where only your ELO is affected. Instead, even when outnumbered in a 2v1, 4v2 or any other match where you've lost everything, leaving a game midway will do three things instead. Decrease your ELO, degrades your Ranked Trust Rating and finally, Negates you from earning any EXP you gained from that match neccessary to level up your army. And mind you the levels are factions specific. You can have a level 4 Germany army but a level 1 UK army. So, do players finish a losing game where they get absolutely zero enjoyment because of getting owned hard? No, they don't. They either cut their internet connection, desync the game or simply use Task Manager to close it. Through this, there would be no changes for their ELO, trust rating or EXP earned. _______________________________________  Stability --------------------------------------------------------------  The stability for this game is poor. Playing with Local friends won't even mitigate the issue as I still get kicked out of a game even if said friend was living around my neighbourhood. The most notorious one of them all is the 'Out-Of-Sync' Error.   This error freezes your game and happens at random intervals and can get very frustrating as it will not record down the online game you spent 45-60 minutes playing. Error dc:x are also annoying.  From what I've gathered, Error dc:0 = the host kicked you mainly due to your ping which is a joke considering that only PC Performance matters while Error dc:3 which is basically the game being a jerk to you.  Keep in mind that this game was in EARLY ACCESS for a couple of months and after its release on April/May 2014, it still gets this kind of problems which is downright unacceptable considering how long of a chance they had to fix this. Heck, the developers are even releasing another EARLY ACCESS game which appears to be MOWAS with a Modern Era reskin somewhere this year which means there goes the technical support for the game.  Conclusion --------------------------------------------------------------  Good game, great gameplay, great mechanic. Poor Ranked Multiplayer. Horrendous Stability  And as MOWAS 2 is a multiplayer orientated game whose only major difference from its predecessor is Steam Intergration with the price of ~$40, I can't recommend this game to anyone unless its on sale.  ~Edited due to Stability issues",

            "review_text": "The Men of war series are great WW2 RTS games, reasonably realistic, balanced and historically accurate when compared to other similar games in the genre.     Overview:   Assault Squad 2 is more of a standalone expansion, in a sense that it builds on the previous titles and stays true to the format, rather than changing it to the point that it loses what makes it great. The game is both fun and challenging, with an added educational aspect with the inclusion of units, vehicles, and weapons of which may help you gain a better understating of their roles in the second world war.    What's new?:   An entirely new feature to Assault Squad 2 is the soldiers now gather experience for their actions, increasing their effectiveness on the battle field, whereas previously long standing soldiers would run out of ammo and may become deadweight, or a micro management calamity. Ammo boxes and supply trucks now generate a field to resupply soldiers and weapons in the nearby vicinity, making it easier to manage your units, particularly in heated or drawn-out engagements.    Features:   One feature of the MOW series worth mentioning is the game speed control function, the ability to scale several different speeds during the game is a great feature. It is particularly useful for micro managing things such as soldiers inventory, mine laying, vehicle/weapon repair and the use of medics. It is also very helpful to players new to the game, and also to just observe the action in slow motion close up.  Assault Squad 2 has mod support, with an in game menu to activate/de-activate them as you please, as well as a Steam workshop, where you can download mods with the click of a button, no messy installations or file overwrites. What gives the game increased longevity is the modding community, they allow you to expand on your experience and add new scenarios, some of which even exceed the games original campaign.    Verdict:   Although the game is not 100% finished, the graphics and textures are improved, but visually is not especially different to the previous titles, at this point the levels for all factions are quite similar for each campaign, and the stealth missions are a bit redundant.  If you are new to the MOW series, or are a fan of them, then I would recommend Assault Squad 2. If you have played early titles such as Assault Squad 1 and it did not leave you wanting more, than this may not be for you, or you may just want to wait for it to go on special to try for yourself.  At the end of the day one must remember that this is a game, made for entertainment, and games differ from reality, if you want reality then simply head outside. Have a nice day :)",

Yes in its core. But I believe the devs are doing very shoddy work behind it and its a victim of their ineptitude.

Your ways to attack the opponent is quite set cause of the tight maps, you haven't much abilitys like to attack the opponents back. Sound is also from very older days, it's hard to seperate gun shots from tank shots. My opinion: the game ain't worth any money. I'm upset cause i wasted so much money.

There are maps set in Russia, Mongolia, China, Normandie,the Pacific, Germany,Africa and many other places. Each map is a little interactive masterpiece. I am not even talking about the community maps.  - Tired of your soldiers being autistic? You can take direct control of anything from heavy tank destroyers to basic soldiers or even supply trucks( I like to drive them when bored).  - The game is easily moddable, there are many wonderful mods.  - Do you like a challenge? There are many achievements only 0.3% players have. Try to get'em all!  - The game is highly competitive and skill based. You can clutch the battle with a single soldier (done that once myself in a single player scenario). On the other side, it does not forgive mistakes. You can lose your top tank in a matter of seconds if someone manages to throw an AT grenade or dynamite in your engine.  - Tired of missions, mods and multiplayer? You can make your maps, and even your missions! Editor is incredibly deep, it gives you unlimited freedom and supports the majority of mods.  - The physics and destructability of the game are stunning. The shell can bounce off one enemy tank and explode another. The whole map can be turned into ruins if you have enough artillery.  - You are not just 'playing' as a commander. YOU ARE a commander in this game.  CONS: - Missions feel copypasted for every nation... Yes, the map changes, but main objectives are constant.This is irritating.  - The price is quite high. Yes, this game is a masterpiece, but still,quite expensive. Get it during sales.  - DLC's are ♥♥♥♥♥♥, but at least you get to add bots into your local game with 'Airborne'.  - Some units (even the 'special' ones) prove to be useless. But most games have weapons/units/items decent players never use.  All in all, this game is almost perfect. This game is not going to bore you,you can play it for hundreds of hours, especially if you do it with your buddies. I am quite upset that this game is not an e-sport discipline yet.",

The fact that it includes a map editor, as did AS1, leaves me wondering why the publisher coudnt have taken the time to build an entire set of new maps at the very least. Dont buy this if you have AS1, and wait for the price to drop again if you dont.",

If you like RTS games and WW2 games this is one game for you, MOW:AS 2 is quite an enjoyable game but yet at times it can be a time consuming RTS game also a quick heads up here--&gt;, (please note that this game is a bit CPU intensive). If you are new to the game some missions on the campaign will probably take you hours or even alot of minutes, but do not worry too much, with a reasonable amount of hours of playing the game you will eventually get uset to the game and you will probably be able to get through all the mission easily on the easy difficulty, also I do not recommend going straight into a battle that isn't matchmaking on multiplayer, otherwise it will be frustrating considering all the skilled players out there that play unranked games alot, but anyways this game has a wide variety of units if you looked in the trailer and 5 different countries to play as, (U.S.A,Germany,USSR,Britain and imperialist Japan). With that said I do highly reccomend MOW:AS 2 to anyone out there that loves RTS games. Now go and have fun and destroy whatever country you are going to v.s.",

The game features a lot of missions split up between the 5 different nations. Germany, GB, USA, Japan &amp; Sovjet Russia. While the pattern for the missions is the same they do play entirely different due too the different maps &amp; nations.  Defend - attack - defend is what the first mission, more like tutorial mission, is like. Every other mission is either attack or defend. You have to capture outposts, reach waymarks and defend hills &amp; important places. Easy, yet challenging.  There is no base building involded - you gain new units via reinforcement points or by capturing enemy tanks. Yes, capturing enemy tanks. Each and every one of your units can be split up, managed individually, forged into a new squad, has his own inventory, can be used with manual aim [...].  Including tanks! Tanks can be used with minimum manpower - the driver only. Or you can fully stack up and even place infantry on the back of the tank for faster movements. Its entirely up to you. You units can switch weapons, ammo &amp; special items, you can loot dead enemies to gain new weapons and ammo [...] the possibilitys are endless.  What is the challenging part of all this? Sounds rather nice, doesnt it?  The challenging part is the micromanagement, map awareness and realism. Tanks who get to close to trenches full of infantery - one AT grenade to his engine and hes busted.   Infantery running over an open field - on mg salvo, all dead.   The game does everything right that can be done right - a solid 10/10!",

To be good you have to know armor values, penetration chances, gun calibers, and much more. You have to invest your points in the right units, know how to use cover, and give your troops good lines of sight. One mortar shell will kill and entire squad if you bunch them up behind a sandbag because, well, that’s reality. Remember that veteran tiger that you saved up all game for? You didn’t support it with infantry so it died to one AT grenade in less than 2 minutes. It’s not CoH 2, or rather a glorified game of rock, paper, scissors, you actually have to think. I already know people will say ‘yeah that’s all well and good but who has the time to learn all that?’ and it’s a weak argument.

And if you play this game without Robz Realism or GSM mod you are going to have a bad time with damage modeling being just plain awful, artillery range being weak like a potato gun and tanks going slower than a snails pace. I really would not recommend playing without one of those mods.  Multiplayer works most of The time quite well if players have good internet connection and pc's. It's easy to get matches happening since there are a small community of dedicated players. You can set up all sorts of custom rules for your games too. Since I like to play with Robz Realism modification The online matches can sometimes end in a game breaking bug if you have lots of units that have broken down and created all sorts of clutter and destroyed buildings and so on. I think it's because the game engine was not meant to be designed for that much stuff on the battlefield at once. Luckily this only happens in really large battles and personally I really don't enjoy the kind of games where there is just too much points available to spend on a thirty tanks and fifteen batallions of troops at once.  There are a lot of content available for this game but the developers have made patches to The game that render some of The steam workshop content unplayable with The latest version. There are a lot of custom campaigns that can be played in co-op too. You can even find a total conversion that gives The game a modern military theme.

Covers are nice, and it is possible to control the soldiers' stance (standing up, prone and so on) manually. Enemy vehicles, if abandoned and not completely destroyed, can be recovered and stolen. Anti tank guns are really effective against tanks, but there is always a certain amount of randomness which makes everything unpredictable and suspencing. Every action has to be planned accurately, and unreasoned and silly moves are very likely to cause disastrous outcomes; there is a nice reinforcements mechanism which depends on the controlled checkpoints, and new weapons are available on the field after a new checkpoint has been conquered. The only bad thing is that, during multiplayer battles, reinforcements are automatically split among players, causing messy situations ('who called this sniper?' 'Can I have your Panzer, or you desperately need it?'). It is possible to send units to an ally player, but this takes time and can be pretty annoying.",

Tanks, infantry and artillery all fulfil their crucial roles in order to achieve victory, and all types of units require an individual commanding approach. Multiplayer is undoubtedly the most apparent upside of AS2.   Since the GEM engine is rather old, the graphics in this multiplayer strategy are a bit below the standards, especially if we start comparing this title to Company of Heroes 2. This, however, is compensated by the scale of the battlefields which are present in this game, with explosions and complete destruction of in-game objects all contributing to an astonishing overall image of war as it is shown in Assault Squad 2. In spite of graphics not being the bestest quality of this RTS, they are nevertheless pleasant to look at. The textures are neat, the models of the vehicles are very detailed, explosions and visual effects are dynamic, thus commiting to credibility. Out of anything more negative, i can only note the models and textures of the infantry, which haven't been updated since 2006 when Faces of War came out.   In general, Men of War: Assault Squad 2 can be recommended to anyone who wants to play a good quality WW2 RTS with a well developed multiplayer.    ",

            "review_text": "i literally have to give this a 'Not Recommended'... why? let me explain....   before? i would have said to buy it, even if you own AS1... sort of a waste of money, but at least no third party multi-player. ( AS1 should have been integrated into steam servers after gamespy closed all servers for all games they supported... but hey, screw that, charge the same players for another game if they want online features )  EVEN before i'd say buy this even with it being the EXACT same game as AS1, just ... horribly optimized? somehow my computer can play AS1 no problem. but AS2 dominated my computer....? when they're the same game? no, i don't understand either.  but then..... they did the WONDERFUL 'Game update 3.112.0' and this has destroyed the game for me. not only does it run EVEN worse on my computer, to the point that any co-op is impossible even with having very fast internet.... but NOW???  NOW... you have NO supplies in trucks. no ammo, no anything. oh wait, grenades...? cool? yeah, not really...  i loved preparing for an assault, stocking my soldiers up with ammo then heading out. now? you can just put 5 grenades on each person and ... nothing else. i hope you like grenades, because that's all you'll be getting.  before, you could unload shells from trucks and make IED's. now, obviously you can't.   your troops get a magical resupply of ammo from trucks. even the officer supply drop was ruined. no rifle ammo, no SMG ammo, no MG ammo. your troops can just fire all day and get resupplied from a small paradrop. it makes NO sense and just kills this game for me. the realism is thrown out the window.   sir hinkel, as i'm sure anyone that plays AS1 or AS2 knows of... ( if you don't, he makes missions for the German Soldier's Mod, which is amazing as are his missions ) made scripts that resupply your troops with crates / trucks. you can watch the ammo going from the truck / crate, and going into your soldiers inventory. it only resupplies to a set number. so 100 rifle rounds, 300 SMG, 1000 MG....  yet the developers somehow did worse than..... a random person using Gem Editor? are you SERIOUS? someone working for free / fun made resupply amazing yet people making LOTS OF MONEY FAIL!?!?!  i've held off on this for a few months now. there's no difference..... i bought AS2 ONLY to support this company for making games that have realism. now? NO. ( stupid me, i even bought the Deluxe Edition to support this company )  sure, video games are all fantasy, even simulators........but this just destroyed it. this game is not 'early access' or alpha, or beta, or ANYTHING else. it's the complete game, and they ruined it for me...  yes, yes... i know, huge long rant about one thing, but it offended me this much. i even posted to developers......no response. nothing. this is the only reason i waited for the negative review. in hopes they'd see and fix this horrible thing they've done.  because of this, i truly can't recommend that you spend ...any money on this, let alone 29.99$ ( as of this moment )  just buy assault squad 1 for a lesser price tag... unless you are REALLY devoted to multi-player and don't want to use third party programs for it.  seriously... AS1 is a master-piece and there are a lot of cool scripts and other things you can use to make awesome missions yourself. it's not hard, just need to spend some time on it. i'd be happy to help anyone learn how to use things in Gem Editor, especially for AS1. ( also AS1 will run better on your computer, no matter how good.... or crappy your computer may be )  hmmm also, if anyone thinks 'only 21.6 hours?' or anything... look at my play time for AS1, 358 hours as of today, and it 'may' be my favorite game...ever. that's why i know AS2 is a huge slap in the face to anyone who has played the men of war games. ( if not going even further back with faces of war and even further back... )  IF and ONLY IF developers put ammo into trucks and crates again will i give this a positive review, and i'd even suggest you pay 29.99$. it's really not a bad game, seeing as it's close to a direct copy / paste of AS1... just doesn't run as smoothly.  LET ME MAKE IED'S AGAIN!!! &gt;;(",

The game developers have just basically released Assault Squad but slapped a 2 on the side of it, as well as this they add the original games missions in to make up for the lack of content. Still same game engine, no graphical improvement, if there is I cannot tell. Nothing real exciting as a whole. And to make the game 'better' they start releasing 'DLCs' such as Iron Fist [Tank Combat] which ads 2-3 missions in which all it does is lock your camera view, and Airborne [Self Explanitory] in which the almost same thing occurs, a small hand full of missions is released, as well as 'bots' bearly functional AI which should've been in the base game not labled as DLC and getting people to pay for it just for extra money. The only semi-decent thing this game even has is mod support, some of the mods are better than the base game itself, and are even free.To me this game is unplayable without mods.And do yourself a favour, if you already have Assault Sqaud, don't get this game, but if you don't mind numerous bugs, crashing multiplayer, underwhelming graphics and single player campaigns, DLCs aimed to make you pay MORE money to get features which should've been in the base game and a overall disappointing game for any REAL strategist out there.

More mission, a tutorial for each nation, and Steam mod support makes the game easily customisable.   Men of War: AS2 is a game of your own experience. There are no heroes to follow, no stories to be told. Unless you say otherwise. You can watch as your US Paratroopers land, commanded by Alan Smith or whoever make there way to a German MG post that's been slaughtering elements of your frontal unit. You create the story in the mission of your choice. Plus, everything is usable. Every individual soldier has ammo, a gun and a helmet, alongside maybe a fieldworks or repair kit, and all these can be taken. You have no more ammo for your rifle? 'Soldier, grab some SMG ammo and that MP 40 from Jerry'. Require a tank, but can't afford it? 'Jackson, see that panzer? Repair it and get it back here'. Every single firearm, every mortar, every AT and howitzer gun, every armoured fighting vehicle, is capable of spewing death upon it's previous masters. Provided you keep them stocked with fuel, ammo, and keeping them intact, of course.   Another addition to the game is the veterency system. Individual soldiers, once they kill someone, will gain some veterency, and gain better stats, more HP, more stamina, better weapon handling, better tank control, everything.   If you're a sucker for WW2 RTS games, then I'd recommend this one. There might be a lot to learn, but it's all compressed neatly onto the screen, while also allowing you to seen what's happening.   And soldier, don't expect everyone under your command to make it out of there alive. War is hell. ",

The mods are alos really good, making realism even better although a little bit harder, I suggest you rack up a few hours of the vanilla game before taking mods on because they really change gameplay. If you love the World War 2 time period and love RTS games, this should be your dream to play, however if you play War Thunder, a few things are different so keep that in mind.

Every unit is important during the game play. Each one gets their own inventory, with access other units as well. While they start with limited ammo, you can search the dead for more.  Like any game, it has it's down falls. The biggest peeve I have is with enemy units being able to see mine across the map, while I can't see them. The more I play this, the more the AI for each unit seems to get dumber. I had one unit run circles around an enemy as I clicked for it to attack, literally doing circles like a dog around your legs. It has a lot of little things that make you scream at the game because it's so frustrating. But it's so addicting, I keep going back for more.  Micro managing is crucial with this game, making it very difficult to master. The enemy AI (Easy, Normal, Hard, Heroic) are all challenging, almost impossible to play without other friends. Which is one amazing aspect because you can play every mission with up to 7 other players LAN or internet. Don't expect to beat a good mission in a short amount of time this game takes lots of time.  I don't like the personal leveling for this game. You have to beat an entire mission to get an exp., this counts for first person controlling of a unit as well. There could be an actual storyline for each campaign, not just the same ten missions for each country.  Every unit is extraordinary. The detail, the movements, even the gunfire immerses you. The sounds and feels of the game are amazing.  This game still has quite a few bugs, as I cannot load a saved game right from the main menu. I once had an invincible enemy unit enter the field, an every unit I had could not take it out. So I had to restart the mission, very frustrating since it was the largest tank at the end of the mission. Also many times main mission objectives don't activate, making you restart the mission.  THE UNIT AI IS HORRENDOUS!! They are always standing up by themselves, which in turn is a death sentence in this game. Medics do not do anything but create another target for the enemy, same with units that have AT grenades/ rockets.  I wish there was tutorial missions to get you into the flow of the combat, that way you can use every aspect of the game.  I've downloaded some mods, and they bring this game to a whole new level.

Instead of researching technologies or building barracks, Men of War allows you to get reinforcements through 'mp', which is steadily gained no moatter what. The rate can be improved by capturing 'strategic points' which are usually marked by a flag. This will show the controlling team's flag as well. Soldiers then run from outside the battlefield into a team's spawn, and then you have reinforcements. Likewise, actual gameplay mechanics diverge from standard rts. The focus moves away from the types of units used and towards what you actually do with them. For example, you can move units into cover and buildings, allowing them to gain protection in certain directions respective to where you put them. Medics can also revive fallen units for a certain time, although (and correct me if I'm wrong) I believe there is a certain number of times a medic can revive a soldier before the soldier stays dead. The game plays like a shooter, except that instead of controlling one soldier you control an army, if that makes sense. I love it, and it is a refreshing break from the standard rts model and its various spinoffs.",

I bought the game twice (for me and for a friend) and my mind just can't understand how an engine from 2006 could run so bad. The game is barely playable in Multiplayer. For those who have not been playing it before I will say this - imagine a constant lag with micro freezing screens ALL the time. Excuse me, but I run Skyrim much better than this. It lags for 80% of people in multiplayer no matter what your PC configuration is. May be if I take some of NASA's supercomputers I will be able to play a normal game. And the lag is just the beginning - yesteday I won a 1v1 battle only because the the guy against me had several game costing bugs (he can't repair his tank, his crew won't enter the second damaged tank which he managed somehow to repair, and his units got completely stuck several times). Today as always I experienced same thing again and that was the end. I decided to write that and to say don't buy that thing unless they fix it. And believe me I will write here again when the game is playabe again I promise.",

Men of War: Assault Squad 2 may have tons in place to let you micromanage every single ♥♥♥♥ your soldiers take, but it doesn't make you.  that's the key: it gives players options. you want to use 8 dudes and be super micro and control everything? go ahead. you want to play more a standard general that let's his troops perform? that's ok too. granted the sweet spot is somewhere in the middle, but its not as micro intensive as I thought it would be.  last thing, this game is HARD! i mean i thought i was pretty good at strategy and tactics but the ai on normal ran over me like i was playing france instead of usa. takes some getting used to, but still really fun if you like a challenge (easy requires you not to be stupid, but you don't have to worry about your inf dying in seconds to anything/everything)  biggest beef: apparently the latest patch made it where you cannot disable shadows. ouch on my fps. also my gtx 570 and i5 cpu hate physics, which the game doesn't allow to be disabled. I understand the game had distructible environments that effect los, cover, etc but the game doesn't have to rendure high level physics to give me that tactical option (see coh2/coh/dawnofwar2). give me these options and i'll be golden.",

The last I played was the original Men of War.  Did have some minor issues at the start (to be expected) but stability has greatly improved now. Direct control is always fun in SP or MP. Unit level lock is a dam pain in MP (supposed to be so new players don't confuse themselves with too many units) it stops you from using units that would greatly help in a lot of scenarios, but saying that the host can turn it off. Another minor annoyance is that fact that people can, and do, quit mid-game if they are losing badly which ruins the fun. Graphics are decent, mod support is good, UI is good and the MP modes are great.",

It reminds me of a game I had years ago called, I think, 'Combat Patrol', it's very similar. I like the chaotic and often hectic gameplay. It's hard to keep track of a lot of units and if your attention wanders to one part of the field then when you look back half your force, in the other part of the battlefield, is dead or destroyed - well at least that's how it seems to work for me. Graphics are good and difficulty is high. Might be better if a few smaller scenarios were introduced. What don't I like?

Not a 4x type game, but you can easily slow the battles down to a speed that your comfortable with. Not like most strategy games where you have an overall map and decide your path. This game has 6-10 different maps for each of the 5 major factions of WW2 except Italy for some reason. Do you want to have 1 soldier be Rambo and do everything? Do you like being a sniper and picking off your enemies from relative safety? Do you like playing tanks and smashing/blowing up anything that moves? You can do all these and more. Command large armies to conquer the map. The physics are surprising well detailed and thought out. Bounce Anti-Tank shells by angling your tank. Toss a grenade on to a tank's engine for fire/explosion. This game has tons of potential and a modding community that really takes the game to its true goals.  Improvements - Hate that a year after I bought the game, the Company changed the minimum requirements so that my old computer can't run this anymore without crashing. I mean, if this was a MMO, I can understand, or something that was constantly getting DLC or expansion packs. But this game had been static for a very long time, and except for the mods, didn't need its requirements changed. - Missions, unforunately, you pretty much do the same 5 missions on each of the factions, like maybe 1-2 missions are truly unique to that faction. - Ammo resuppy is still messed up. Unless your able to move soldiers to just hang out around an ammo truck for long periods of time to get them to resupply 1 stack of ammo every minute, what is on the truck is pretty much all you have to pick from. I mainly get most of my soldier's ammo from the dead, thankfully, there are only 2-4 types total in the game. Biggest draw back is using tanks that don't have that same option. An enemy tank may have the same size caliber of gun as your tank, but the ammo still doesn't work for it. Ammo trucks worked great until they changed it in a patch a long time ago.  All in all. This is a great game, for a great price now. Mods really make this game stay alive and fun to play as well as the multi player option. Recommend 9/10. Oustanding game if you can get it on 50% off weekend or summer sale.",

Now, if you haven't played a Men of War game before and are a fan of WWII RTS games, then definitely have a look at this one. The level of detail in the game is just crazy.  - Destructible environment: Nearly everything can be destroyed. Bomb it, grenade it, drive a tank through it. Buildings, trees, almost everything.  - Detailed vehicle system: Vehicles need fuel. They also have detailed parts that can be damaged, like the tracks, the turret, and the engine. They can also be repaired to get a vehicle back in action.  - Supplies: Troops need ammo. Take ammo from dead soldiers or call in a supply truck to resupply your troops.  - Detailed maps: The maps are very life like. The structures can be used for cover, or to lay a trap for oncoming soldiers.  These are staples of the series, going back to the original Faces of War. If you get the chance to pick up any in the series, go for it.",

This release was a step back and from the moment I first played I think I knew. Silly little things that had balance issues (in AS2's early days the willy's jeep was flat out ridiculous, it was pretty much bullet proof and pople would buy it straight away and decimate the enemy). And I have no idea why they hell they rank locked units, just another silly 'upgrade' I had hoped over time It would be fixed (mainly multiplayer issues including connectivity and balance issues) but as for now I do doubt it'll ever be salvaged. Now I'm not saying AS1 wasn't without it's issues, but when AS2 was announced I thouht it was going to fix AS1's problems. I was wrong. Dead Wrong.   AS1 for me was fun but AS2 is just frusterating, because it is supposed to be the successor but if anything you'd think it the predeccessor. AS2 has left a bitter taste in my mouth and as much as I would love to get into Call to Arms, I will give it a miss.  The AS community would be infinitely better off if AS2 was scraped and AS1 was reinstated and a multiplayer function was reimplemented. But alas that would never happen because too many people have paid money for AS2.  I feel sad that It had to end this way, but this will be the last game from this dev I shall purchase (unless he turns up his game (no pun intended)).",

            "review_text": "Men of War: Assault Squad 2 is one of the best games I have ever played alongside Mount &amp; Blade: Warband. With it's incredibly cinematic moments and totally unpredictable outcomes to every action you perform makes the game not only fun on the first few missions, but fun and addictive throughout every level of the single player campaign.  ---Single Player---  You can chose to play as any of the major countries involved in WW2 such as the USA, Commonwealth (UK), Germany, Soviet Union and Japan. Each country has unique and very historically accurate weapons, all with their own unique statistics which represent their advantages and disadvantages in the real conflict, for example, the MG42 has an astounding fire rate whereas the Bren gun has incredible accuracy as in real life. The AI is not the greatest I've ever seen but certainly not the worst, it uses cover to a good effect and pulls off incredible ambushes with AT grenades wich can really mess you up, which is nice, it forces you to be more cautious and not have every asset you have available to you just roll up a field and kill everything that moves and they are incredibly defensive, rarely attacking with large groups of soldiers, they use artillery ONLY on tanks and time and time again I have seen artillery completely ignore my grouped up infantry and target a light tank at the end of its range with no engine, tracks or crew. The AI really needs improving but thankfully there are many mods which do just that. Another flaw with the game is the unpredictablity, I know I said it was a positive because it keeps it interesting and thats true, but the AI will constantly bring out infantry platoons or armoured cars when an AT gun would be far more usefull. Sure, it leads to more varied missions and makes you have to deal with differant situations but it works to the players favour so often that it actually reduces the challenge of the game. Other than this, I have no other criticism.  ---Multi-Player---  I haven't played mush of the multiplayer but from what I've seen, it seems very similar to single-player but with more available units (and no AI.) The game is amasingly balanced and an experienced player can use the nations advantages to win the game, even knowing what differant countries were good at, e.g. Germany had good heavy tanks and a high fire rate with their machine guns, the UK had a very accurate machine gun (but most of their planes are not in the game as far as I am aware unfortunately, as this was probably there best asset) and the US had very good medium tanks, means you can use that knowledge to benefit your game. It's a very accurate game and extremely well balanced because every nation has things they are really good at and things they are not so good at so the game comes down to who can press their advantage the hardest and neutralise the enemies advantage the easiest and not who uses a cheesy startegy and who doesn't.  ---Verdict---  I would deffinately recommend this game, it has incredible moments that make great screenshots and the gameplay is some of the best I have ever seen. If you're not a history fan or not a fan of the era, you will not enjoy the game as much but is still worth getting if you ever see it on sale. As for the history fans, £20.00 is a reasonable asking price for what it offers but I would still recommend waiting for a sale just in case you decide you don't like the game you wont have wasted too much money, which I doubt you will anyway but always best to be cautious.  8.5/10 Because the gameplay itslef is amazing but the AI drags the rating down. A great game that every history fan must own.",

The modding community keeps the game fresh and exciting. Even though it was just a revamped version of Assault Squad 1, it's still worth a try.  If you're bored with single player missions, play the editor. If you're bored with the editor, try some mods, then try to play it in the editor. Sky's the limit (and the game's programming capability) on what you can do in the editor.   - A massive Russian charge against an entrenched German position? Check. - Crash dive a Japanese plane to an American tank? Check. - Create a commando mission similar to the old Commandos game? Check. - Make a large map with the AI clashing each other in a decisive battle? Check. - Massacre an entire group of chickens using a Colt? Check.  The lists will go on and on. You will find some mods interesting that will make you play more.  Rating: 8/10 it still needs some fixing but it's a must-have.",

Both are great games but if you really care about multiplayer support and other cool new features get this. But if you dont have a really good pc to run this with good frame rates and avg settings get the original game for basically the exact same experience just with worse graphics 4-5 less maps and worse ai. Both are great games but I would personally favor the First Assault Squad for the price (G)(2)(A). com and the content.

One big issue I have with the game is the direct control mode. It seems neat at first, but really it's just a way to force you into micromanaging everything your units do, which is a bit tedious in an RTS. Animations in this game are dreadful, and it's horribly obvious when doing certain things like moving in direct control or when your units are swimming.  I do like that you can pick up weapons from dead enemies, the inventory system, the ability to change different types of ammunition, and the lack of base building. Reinforcements come from outside the map, which is pretty realistic. I was never a fan of the base building in CoH. Being able to tow certain heavy weapons such as the flak 88 is pretty neat too.  I think this game could be a real contender for best WW2 RTS had the developer spent more time polishing the game up. As it stands I still prefer CoH.",
