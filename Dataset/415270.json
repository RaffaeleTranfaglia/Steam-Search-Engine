            "review_text": "Great free to play digital CCG. You can earn credits to buy packs. Haven't spent any money in game and played over 100 hours.  Star Crusade is in a smiliar vien to MTG,Hearthstone and other CCGs. Like any ccg there is a learnig curve to learn what the key words are and how the cards and abilities play together.  There are some nice differnces that make Star Crusade stand out. Heroes have changable modules(powers/abilities) and earn energy that can be spent to buff certain cards effects.  There is an ability to melt cards and create cards or modules you like or need for speciffic decks.  update: Recent addition of a story mode allows for solo play and rewards you with some cards and boosters. Exploration mode rewards players with credits, scrap, card backs, boosters, random card and avatars for a very short mini game.",

So bear this in mind if that is a concern for you.   Overall - this game is a high quality product. Feel free to try it out for free to see if it's your cup of tea.",

CONS: -You play vs BOTS even in Ranked. Hope this is removed soon. -Needs much more cards, which will happen with time probably. -Needs more people playing it.  CONCLUSION:   Go play this, you will like it for sure. Give it time and it will grow, probably.",

This game is fun and has lots of classes to choose from, with great card variety. I did not spend a single dime until this moment and got pretty far in ranked mode; just by playing, you receive credits to unlock decks which all have good cards. You can even scarp those that you do not want and build the ones you wish for.  Give it a chance and trust me you will be pleasantly surprised at how fun it is and how you will be thinking of new trategies and decks to smash your opponents.  Will buy some decks to support the developers, because they are worth it. To each his own, as you are not obliged do so. Nobody asks for your money as oppposed to other free to play games. So go ahead and download it and play, play, play.",

            "review_text": "OK, here is a thing that happened to me and the reason why i won't recommend it in any way. I started the game up, played through the tutorial played a few matches in casual, won a few, lost a few. You know the usual. Then the next 5 battles we're all againstthe same faction. The Shant'Ti and all playes pulled the same strategy on me. Using their abilities they were able to get ENSURED CARDS! A game that is based around the idea of luck is broken through a very simple mechanic that is given to them, while other factions also can summon cards for basicly nothing or damage for almost no cost, this is different. This is a medium level creature card that they almost get for free, pretty much whenever they want, so yeah they succesfully included the Zerg Rush in a game that immitates a blizzard game. Yes i have only played it for two hours, which actualy started very well but i know what my time is worth and in this case it was actualy wasted by something free. Maybe the game gets better after time, maybe after one gets a few more and effective cards this stragety becomes useless, but i don't care. This game showed me a mechanic so unfunny to fight against the likes of which i have never seen in 15 years of gaming on PC and on consoles. Pick it up if you want, it's free after all but this is something you might encounter  Edit: After an answer from the Developer, i have understood why my first time with the game had been such a let down for me. I will thereby only count the things for the review that happened before the 5 consecutive matches of pure hatred happned. So disclose everything i said about it being unbalanced as it just so happened that i ran into a lot of unfair matches against better players several times in a row that all happened to play a race that a had just recieved a major buff. I guess this was a one in a gametime thing then.",

            "review_text": "Fun game, lots of similarities to hearthstone with much more in depth customization of the classes. Casual felt way too easy, people playing whatever not understanding tempo or value trades. Ranked is another bag as the skill of the opponent is much better, but the decks used are typically much better as well making it very difficult to win unless its against other new players wandering into the fray.   All in all game is fun and as to be expected for a CCG you need to either invest time or money in order to get better cards. From the looks of it however card packs are much easier to farm in this than some other CCG's I've played. If you're new add me as a friend for quests!",

However, in my time of playing i have seen too many ShanTi decks which can stomp other decks into the ground. I also see lots of hierarchy decks. The other classes (in ranked at least) are almost non existant. Probably due to ease of play or just power, I'm unsure. The game hasn't been out long so balance issues are to be expected.  Lots of cards that make decks work as they should have to of course be acquired from packs that you buy. Some cards are so quintisential that it sort of makes the game pay to win and the basic cards you get from levelling up aren't strong enough to give new players a good deck that can stand up against the people who somehow have much stronger decks within just a week (Maybe a beta that let them keep their cards?)  Still, I enjoyed my time playing the game and i would suggest giving it a go. ",

            "review_text": "  The answer is yes. I know what you're thinking, and this game pretty much plays just like Hearthstone.  PROS If you've played Hearthstone, you'll pretty much know how to play this game right away. Firepower and Spell Damage, Assault and Windfury, or Cyphers and Secrets, etc. etc. In my opinion, it's not a bad thing to be similar. You know what they say, 'if it ain't broke, don't fix it.' The core Hearthstone mechanics are here. Draw some cards, gain a point of mana, play some cards, rinse and repeat... Though there's only a handful of mechanics that are different, there's enough to force different strategies. Take for example, the Module mechanic, it's pretty much a Hero Power, but you're allowed to customize these in a way that dictates your deck.   And on a side note, the cards are pretty nice to look at.   CONS Game plays very slowly and it's quite easy to screw up your turns. Hate to sound like a broken record, but with Hearthstone, you can pretty much play all your cards, end your turn, and watch it play out. Try this with Star Crusde and I guarantee you it'll ignore 50% of your moves and still let you end your turn. So what happens is, you have to play one card at a time and wait for it to play out before playing your next card.  This game's version of Arcane Dust is Scrap. However, disenchanting/scrapping cards barely returns any Scrap and most of the cards are friggin' expensive. Almost not worth it to even try and scrap anything.  And lastly, this game's version of Arenas, called Raids. You have to pay with your Gold/Credits or use real money just to get in. It's a giant barrier to entry when you get bored of the standard play mode.   EXTRA Yeah, this game is Early Access, so it's a given that there's not that many people. However, more often than not, I find myself paired up with the same person over and over again. Almost becomes habit to just take turns and concede.",
