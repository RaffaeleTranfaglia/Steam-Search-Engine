            "review_text": "A mobile game in the past that is obvious from the playing field which occupies 1/3 of the screen. Quite short &amp; easy, and it could be completed in one evening, but it also has a survival mode and the grinding achievements. The game itself is fun, the art is nice, the soundtrack is pleasant; you'll get as much as the price implies.",

            "review_text": "this is a short but very enjoyable puzzle game, where you play as the cats of course who have had there catnip stashs stolen, the culprits? the fish! oh and lets not froget the mastermind, as there is always a mastermind.  the game is simple in a sense, as you match up the tiles to attack, or repair. there is a few attack types in the game, flame freeze poison and rocket, the only other tile type is repair. which of course the more tiles you match together in 1 row the stronger the effect is when it happens.  i should also note there is a currency system which is used to upgrade your health, repair and the various attacks. there is 3 storefronts 1 which takes coins to upgrade your weapons, a 2nd which takes catnip to boost your weapons and the 3rd is the unlockable cats/ships , which takes a bit of both.  in total there is 15 stages all replayable, and a score system based on time with 1 to 3 star ratings. included in these 15 stages are 3 boss stages which act as normal stages leading to the bosses. once every stage has been completed survival mode unlocks, and i will admit it is a challange.  last thing i should add is that each ship includes its own attack visuals, grumpy cats is a cardboard ship, so he fires tollietpaper, the aliencat fires a laser beam, oh and lets not froget the witchs cat who fires a magic blast.  overall the game is short and just about everything can be unlocked within 5 hours that includes majority achivements, the only achivements that will take you time is the 500 surfer defeats and survival mode kills.  so if you like puzzle games with rpg twists and alotta cuteness check this great game out  to avoid any confusion, catnip and coins both are gainable via battles, all currencys are available ingame without having to pay more then just for the game.",
