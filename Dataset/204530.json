A fine balance between powerful upgrades and being hopelessly outnumbered allows for a fun mixture of a power trip with a slap in the face of miserable failure.

            "review_text": "Infested Planet is a hectic horde RTS title that matches a handful of marines with thousands of bugs and mutated nasties, overwhelming battles will remind you of Starship Troopers' scenes where death and retreat are inescapable.   All missions start with one or more base and a team of marines, with slightly varying goals in the campaign, which ultimately require the capture of all remaining bases and/or destruction of all alien hives. Variety is lacking, but the constant tide of aliens vs your rag-tag team of marines will keep you on the edge, inching slowly towards full domination.  Sound and music are serviceable, graphics are bright and clean, albeit a bit too monotone and can make spotting your troops a bit of a challenge (especially with some overhanging cliffs textures). There is enough structures and technology to keep you engaged in random missions and skirmishes, but not enough depth of strategy to warrant investing more than a few hours after finishing the main campaign.   Good fun for tough RTS fans but implementing multiplayer with a hive faction DLC would make this a solid title! 3.5/5",

            "review_text": "Great game that I thoroughly enjoyed completing.  I want to address some of the negative comments. Most peoples problems boil down to them not having worked out how to play the game properly. By the sounds of it, the extent of their strategy is deciding do I build 7 shotgunners, or 5 flamers, and then do I attack this point or that point. No wonder they can't complete the later levels.  This game requires constant 'recycling', and effective use of the limited resources. You need to do things like recycle old turrets and advance them forward, or turn your soldiers into snipers to take out the turrets, and then quickly switch them to flamours to rush in.  Sometimes you have to let some of your bases get captured, so you can focus on capturing the enemies in a specific pattern. For example, allow a base that is being attacked from 3 directions to be captured, so you can work your way down 1 of these of these directions, then return to your original base and only have to fend off aliens in 2 directions.  To claim this game lacks in strategies is absurd. The aliens will constantly beat you and cap your bases, so it is regularly 2 steps forward, 1 step back. If you can't handle 'losing for the greater good', then this game might not be for you.  Saying this though, the full price does seem a bit steep, and I did get on special.",

            "review_text": "The first time I heard about this game was from this  youtuber's review  and also watching his LP (Let's Play) video and I was just hooked enough to get the game.   It's a Top down strategy game where you control a few armies against swarm of aliens trying to eliminate one of their hive after the other.   Simple concept but it has a lot to offer for an indie game.   Every time you advance things get a bit tougher because of the alien mutations plus they sometimes went on a rampage at some point of the game each time you destroy one of their hives. But not only that. Since they're scattered across the map, they tend to re-capture undefended base and turn them back as hives. So there's a lot of micromanaging going on. Sure a few missions are manageable but as you progress, the game will encourage or even unleash your hidden strategic think-tank that's been cooped inside the core of your head for a long time and you don’t have a choice or else you'll lose the game.   But not to worry, perks like weapon modifications and support units (air drops, air strikes...etc) are in the game and usable on each mission. However, if you want to use them you have to earn money and to earn money you will have to win a couple of previous missions in order to advance and all that are in the game with no microtransactions required.   So this game is recommended to those who like RTS (Real Time Strategy) and/or wants to know how it feels like to get swarm by aliens with a few number of units to control like one of those bugs from  Starship Troopers  [www.imdb.com]     'These are the rules. Everybody fights, nobody quits. If you don't do your job I'll kill you myself. Welcome to the Roughnecks!'  - Rico from the movie. But in the game's case, Aliens will run you over.    Have fun! ",

            "review_text": "TLDR: If you're looking for RTS games, it's one of the best.  Did not expect the game to be this great!  Unlike most RTS games I've played, EVERY unit here feels valuable!  The AI is really cool. Here's one of the reasons why: For example, I have a team of five, one of them is a sniper. The sniper knows what he's there for, which is taking out small spawning pods and turrets. So, when I send the entire team to attack a hive, the sniper seems to prioritize the targets more suited for him.  You could also take control of each unit individually and micromanage, of course.  On average, each game takes 10-20 mins(at least for me).   Easy to jump into, easy to stop playing. (I'm one of those people who want to play something, open the library, stare at it, and can't decide on what to play, end up closing steam and doing something else &lt;_&lt;. I also easily lose track of time.)  So far, I have only played the game for around 12 hours, and it is already among my top 5 favorites.",

            "review_text": "I had been eyeing this game for a long time; it looked like a lot of fun but I was a bit put away by the cost. When I finally saw it was on sale, I got the Deluxe Edition right away.  Oh boy, it is fun!  I think the closest comparison to how this game feels is the film Starship Troopers. The core of the game is as follows: on each randomly generated map, there are several capture points. One of them is yours, and the rest are the aliens'. You have to send your small team of marines to capture these points. However, there is a hive to destroy on each one, protected by automated defenses, not to mention the ENDLESS stream of bugs that will go after you. By capturing points and collecting some crates spread around the map you get resources that you can spend on more marines (dead ones respawn), new weapons for your marines, turrets, robot medics, global abilities and more. However, since these resources are limited, you will have to decide and eventually recycle your buys because...  ... the aliens aren't static either. For each point you capture, they will get a permanent mutation according to your strategies. For example, using flamethrowers might cause their poison turrets to have a knockback effect, or have a much longer range. Their hives might start to spit acid themselves. Their critters and spawners might enter frenzy mode after you capture a point. They might start to spawn hardened critters, living bombs or even clones of your marines! As the aliens adapt, you'll have to adapt as well, by recycling upgrades (for 100% of their cost) and reconsidering your strategy. There are a lot of mutations and upgrades, so the game never gets old.   The game has a campaign, random skirmishes and 'weekly challenges' where you compete with other players for a place on the leaderboard. The campaign is quite varied, and serves both as an introduction and as a way to play special missions, like escorting a convoy or testing a new lifeform. You'll earn credits by completing these increasingly difficult missions, which you can spend on unlocking all these cool upgrades for your marines (I guess in Skirmish mode all of these upgrades are already unlocked). The story is cliché, but enjoyable.  I highly recommend getting the Trickster's Arsenal DLC. It adds new toys for both your marines and the aliens, among other stuff, giving some nice additional variety to an already varied game. If you can, get the Deluxe edition!  I must mention the dev is making another DLC that adds a conquest-like campaing, where you would be capturing regions of the planet via regular missions, and unlocking upgrades as in the current story campaign. Since he announced he was working on it on March, I'd say we can expect this new DLC to arrive soon...  Finally, the simplicity of the graphics means it will probably run super smoothly on the vast majority of computers. Units and effects are simple but pretty, and retain a lot of detail if fully zoomed in. It does look and sound nice to me.  Oh, and one can't review this game without mentioning the HUGE bodycount. On the post-mission summary, it's normal to have killed tens of thousands of aliens and having lost tens of marines. A nice reminder of the scale of the battles!  To finish my review: a game that is genuinely fun to play, that will make you think to overcome the AI's reactions to your own strategies, with a lot of ways to play, and space marines vs bugs, plus continued dev support. Do I recommend it? Hell yeah!",

Another design aspect of the game is that the alien behavior clearly looks like liquid flow, so it sometimes appears you're dealing with rivers going wild (or plumbing issues).

On a scale of 1-10: This game is a 9.5 personally it is a very hard game. You see so many easy tower defense games but this is so easy level 1-5 but later your going to have a pain with this but totally worth time spending and coming up with a good plan.  Genre: Tower Defense and Strategy.  When to buy: Well a sale is great but 15$ for this game is honestly worth it completely :)  Now for a personal review: First I wanted to say that this game is very good but i still have yet to beat everything cause it is quite hard. There are trading cards and achievments for those certain people and the achievments are easy to get for the most part though. But back to the game itself you look at this and it look slike an FPS but then you actual play the game and your like woah wait what am I playing. So you have a squad of 4 men who are able to be upgraded into differnt classes and you are able to build stations to improve your bases quality. So your goal is to take your squad and invade aliens bases. Over time the aliens gain perks which are very annoying for the most part which makes this part of the game the planning part. For most story missions there are set levels where you have to play on but there are also side quests where every time you do it the level is randomly generated which is also another plus. So you take over bases build turrets and you have this thing called BP which is pretty much how you upgrade things and your squad of 4 may be increased using BP. You may also redo any missions to gain more money for perks. Some perks last forever and some are a one time mission only. Now for the two side quests you may do. There are two types the first type is command and conquer and the second part is time limit destruction. In command and conquer you must pretty much take over evrey base you see, you have infinite time but let me warn you as they will gain perks the longer you play. There are 3 majoy difficulties which are where the achievments come in. Now for time limit destruction you must destroy all of the bases within a time limit. For every base you destroy you gain more time. This also has 3 majoy difficulties just like command and conquer. So overall this game is worth getting for anybody you can grasp the concept easily you might rage later on but you won't regret this buy :)!!!!!!!! ",

There is a short, generic story by means of dialogue windows to go along with it that serves its purpose to move from one mission to the next. The reason this game is great though is because of the gameplay. I feel that the player and the enemy are very well matched and the mechanic for capturing points with your squad (or other mission objectives) to build up your squad is rewarding. In addition, I found that the Attack+Move command works intelligently (e.g. snipers/scouts will target towers/buildings among the horde of enemies so there is no need to micromanage when things get crazy). The variety of weapons/technologies and enemy types is more than enough to keep the game interesting and allow for multiple strategies. In the Campaign section there are multiple types of games too (standard, raid, hunt, etc.) that will shift your strategies.  I am most impressed with the Endgame content. I felt the acheivements were adequately challenging yet fair. In addition to the Campaign, there is a Skirmish mode and a set of Weekly challenges (with a leaderboard). The Skirmish mode is basically a map generator with all sorts of customization. The only thing I would ask for from the Skirmish mode is the ability to increase the rate of growth of the enemy past the current capping point.   Otherwise, for the asking price, this is a great game.  ",

            "review_text": "I have played this game for quite a while and I have enjoyed it a lot. I will start with a simple list: +Good graphics +Very fun gameplay, it take quite a bit of micro-managment +Very satisfying, there is something that feels so good about killing thousands of aliens. +Has a good difficulty, not to easy, not to hard  -No multiplayer (Yet this game feels perfect for it) -It is rather repetitive -The game lacks replay value -The campaign is rather short  So for the graphics, what can I say? They are alright. AAA titles will put it to shame, but graphics mean little in a game unless they are downright horrible or put strain on performence. Because the aliens tend to attack on multiple fronts and resources are limited, you have to choose what the spend it on carefully and arranges your troops well. Will you send your entire squad to take down a group of hives and risk losing a point? Or will you split you team up and chance it? Wil you split you team up and back up your assault with heli strikes? There are plenty of options. The difficulty isn't to bad, though not to easy either. (Unless you spam seige cannons) Occasionally there will be that ONE factor that screws you such as losing a support building or a tower spawner messing up your base. The mutations also add a whole layer of depth into the game. There are 33 different mutations that buff the enemy when you take a hive. Basically, the closer you get to winning, the harder it becomes.  Now on the bad side, the game doesn't have multiplayer. This game feels perfect for it though. You can have a marine commander pitted against an alien commander and they try to beat each other. The alien commander could draw paths for the alien swarm to follow and unlock new mutations, hives, and build turrets. This could even go a step further and allow a few other players to play as hero units General Magusson, The doctor, or drake where they move around, shoot weapons with crosshairs, and throw grenades at the cost of ammo. That would cater to the more action players while the RTS players play as the commander above them.  The gameplay gets rather repetitve during long play sessions. This is because most missions are pretty much 'Capture the points' or 'Kill all the hives' The campaign puts some variation into the missions, such as convoy, supply recovery, etc. Overall the game needs a few more modes. After the campaign is over, the game lacks replay value, there just isn't some kinds of in-game acheivment system or secret unlocks. It just makes you lose intrest. You can still make highly customizable skirmish modes and do daily challenges though, so that is addition content if you feel the desire to play them. It took me about 10 hours to beat the campaign, and that manages to defeat most AAA games. I just feel that the game could use more story content and a better story. (The story is basically 'Kill all the aliens')   To summerize, the game has weak replay value, no multiplayer, and a weak story. The gameplay is solid the graphics have their charms and the feeling of killing thousands of aliens as well as the metagame make this very fun to play. I rate this game a 10$/60$ (Rating by money, how unorthodox) When this game is on sale it will have massive value to it. You can buy it at full price if you have money to burn. This is a great game while it lasts, if this game has a good multiplayer added I would bump the rating up the 15$/60$. This is rocket Bear studios first project and I can definitly see more great stuff coming from them. This game earns at least 10 dollers of you money in it's current state. ",

Using the equipment you develop feels like it is actually useful and trying to use what resources you have effectively is challenging but far from impossible. The difficulty both from scenario to scenario as well as within each piece is reasonably well-done. If I was to criticise this game for anything it would be that there isn't the ability to hotkey squads like in a standard RTS so you have to be a bit more careful about splitting your troops up, but most of the time you bundle up and attack move anyway. This leads to a bit of potential oversimplicity for some, although I like the straightforward nature of the game.

I appreciate that there are different strategies that you can play, and there is no one set way of playing the game 'right.' The AI mutates, which means you have to change your strategy on the fly, and you are able to do so because you can change character class, and buildings on the spot. The game is fast-paced, and there's no resource collecting.  Some problems with the game though is that it can be rubber-bandy. You take over one spot and another one gets taken over. You retake it, and the enemy regroups somewhere else... Another problem is that the 'tidying up' phase can be a bit drawn out. Not so bad that you're looking for one peasant hiding somewhere in the fog of war, but there's a point when you can say: 'I won already, c'mon...'  Pros: Various strategies work equally well. Fast-paced. Good variety of buildings and character classes. Feels good gunning down waves of aliens. No grinding or other time-consuming activities.  Cons: The game is a bit short. But it has decent replay value. Graphics could be better. Controls are not as precise, or snappy as I would've liked.  Excellent game, worthy of it's price tag, and an even better deal if on sale.",

There are certain weapons and structures that make winning significantly easier and there are certain mutations that make winning almost impossible.  Getting the wrong combination can turn any game into an un-winnable stalemate. I've rarely lose a game but there have been a number of games where we reach an impasse because I don't have the tools I need to win and they can't break my defenses. Maybe that speaks to my lack of skills but it does make the game a bit frustrating because I know I need to reroll the scenario and hope for a better combination.  I like the game; just realize that this is a game meant to be played, not to be beaten.",

You have points to spend on each map, but you can keep changing their allocation as you play through the map. I feel like it isn't very challenging to be able to keep switching how you have used them.  Overall? 7.5/10",

Once you start progressing in campaing and random missions you will feel difficulty going higher, monsters will spawn more fierce and more relentlessly than until now. Modifiers are making this game exciting and even more difficult, it would be a shame if monsters had HP regen, shield, and neurotoxins.. but who played it knows that 3 modifiers is the only beginning..  You can always WIN if u act FAST and be prepared to make sacrafices. Upgrades are necessary but which one you need?  -granades? is awesome but Life Support module might be even more helpful, but what about teleporting device? it will give you AI controlled unit every single time when your squad member dies.. but wait what about buildings? oh yes you have to share precious resources between - buildings, upgrade modules and soldier upgrades. resources are LIMITED. It's up to you if u can kill the bugs. never give up! But if u still can't win with your genuine mind then buy one time buffs. more soldiers , additional flamethrower or minigun can change whole game. or at least help you survive another 5 minutes..    +Fast pace +progress difficulty +graphic +price +replayability (random missions with random difficulty FTW) +weekly challenges ",
