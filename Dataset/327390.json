            "review_text": "Really, this is THE game to get from the classic pack. You've never played anything quite like this except for Pirates. Take Pirates's combination of minigames into a piracy sim and instead of swashbuckling swordfights and sea battles you have sneaking through enemy offices, placing wiretaps, decrypting memos, and trying to stay one step ahead of a terrorist plot that unfurls in game time.   It's a little unwieldy, the sinister plots are reused constantly and the 'true end game' of capturing all the masterminds is a pipe dream of a LOT of repetition. Dr. Pasture will be kidnapped at least six hundred times before you can reach that goal, but the core mechanics are good fun.  It plays in DosBox and plays perfectly in this day and age. Just read the manual as the stealth controls are a bit unwieldy. Numpad to move, crouching's importance, what to take along and why, and disguises and how you use/lose them are all explained there in a way that would be tough to figure out just from playing it.",

            "review_text": "One of the greatest game I played as a child. Controls are a bit wonky, but it's worth trying it out. You create your character simply from Male or Female, then from 4 skill sets; Combat, Crypto, Driving, and Electronics which all have a rating to them. Then you in a free roam world to a degree, you hang out at the office, review the case files, place a wire tap, break into a suspect's building (stealth or loud), tail a suspects car to a new location, travel to exotic locations. It's a great game that shouldn't be missed! Matter of fact I still own the original and couldn't figure out out how to get 3.5 floppies to run. Here it is ready to go! Thanks!",

This is what a spy game should be - a game that requires you to decide where to go, how to gather information, and decode enemy messages.   And despite its dated graphics, I think it holds up rather well. ",

            "review_text": "Before Splinter Cell, before “Metal Gear”, there was a game that felt like a true stealth/spy game: “Covert Action”. I bought this game when it first came out and it took up many weekends before my PC was upgraded from Dos to Windows.  You’re a secret agent who is tasked with uncovering and averting plots. You’ll travel to a lot of places, do wiretaps, break in and gather evidence, follow suspects and do some crypto. Arrest or “turn” hostile cell members until you finally capture their Mastermind.  There might even be a double-agent and false leads to filter through. And if the faction you’re targeting is not in your city’s listing, then break or wiretap their allies and get the location that way. This is one of those games where you have to actually think and remember. Keep a legal pan and pen on hand; you might need to jolt down a name or faction to look up in their computers to get a location.  Then rinse and repeat. Some might think it’s boring and one-note, but I never felt bored by it. There is enough variation that kept me from that.  This is one of those games that needs to be revisited and revised. The clock is constantly ticking and each false lead is time taken away as the plot is coming together.   The cryptography minigame is a real gem and was what got me interested in ciphers. Ever since, it pains me that such a minigame is never repeated in future “spy/stealth” games since.   Another game in the genre, overlooked and obscure, is “Floor 13”.   For a Dos game that was about ten megs, I have to wonder why the install files are nearing 200 megs. Weird. Of course, there is no remapping of keys. No mouse support (but still joystick, again, weird).",

The manual is essntial to learning how to even play the game, it's located in the installation folder.  This game takes a few hours to understand what's going on, and then it's just a matter of fiddling around and retrying the minigames. I can see myself playing this game forever.",
