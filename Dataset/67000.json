Controlling your own little spaceship, shooting 'enemy' objectives and gather power-up items makes it feel like an all classic space-shooter game.  It’s more a case of floating around, attacking anything that comes in your direction, exploring the intriguing and trippy world.        Rift&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "  Probably one of the most chill and relaxing games Ive played in a long time. I got caught up most of my time just cruising around and enjoying how my music (Alestorm :D) effected the scenery. The settings are pretty easy to tweak so you can make increase or decrease the effect your music has on the background. My favorite was the Christmas tree one with the snowflakes. Also, no worries if you dont have any of your own music to use, the game comes with a built in soundtrack thats about an hour or so long. I tested a few songs and the tracks I tried out were pretty well made for the game.  Basically, you are some sort of entity flying around space shooting gray pacmans with teeth, helping little ghost allies, and finding upgrades. Its nothing too overly complicated, and if you die it just restarts you. If youre after achievements (soon I plan on trying to work on them), youll need to increase the difficulty to increase the amount of bad guys that spawn. If youre just looking to cruise around to some music, I recommend leaving the difficulty on easy and just enjoying it.  Combat isnt too complicated. Theres a zoom button, and some power ups to fly through, but there isnt any upgrading or anything like that.  I didnt find any bugs or crashes and the game ran smoothly  Overall, Id recommend it. It sort of reminds me of the old Winamp visualizations and what Id imagine would happen if you could make a game out of them. Its an extremely relaxing and chill experience of a game.",

This game in particular is a great addition to that genre. Although it took me a while to get used to the controls and get into the whole flow of things, once I was there I had a lot of fun playing around on this game. Adding my own music and seeing how it affected my surroundings, you can play about with certain options and there is a fairly wide variety of levels to play around in. The visuals are so calming; it gave the game a real chilled and relaxed feeling for me. I haven’t spent long on this game but it is something I really should put more time into. If you enjoy music based games and want something a little more relaxed than others, this is a great one to try.",

This game brings you back to what games used to be. This is simple and beautiful. This is the game that brings back the purst form of gaming...to have fun and get a ♥♥♥♥♥in' high score. The fact that you can use your own music to power the game makes it personal in a way that most games wish they could. The only aspect of the game that is flawed is the fact that only MP3s can used. Other then that this is the purest game moeny can by. There is nothign to 'get'. If your looking for purpose and inflated forced story, look elsewhere. This pure game is simply for the joy of playing games. I can't recommend it enough. I wish more games were like this one.   10 out of 10.",

Luckily, I have a space ship of some sort, powered by pretty lights.  The Polynomial manages to have a beautiful, trippy look without being visually overstimulating. A person can zone out while playing it on a peaceful setting and fly through clouds of phosphorescent wiggling nebulae, listening to whatever music they desire. Someone else could fly recklessly through space, battling battling hordes of enemies.   If the game has a flaw, it's that it has no story and no direction. Nothing urging you through that next wormhole and into the next nebulae, other than wanting to see how pretty it is. It's a great game to watch, particularily if you don't want to think. If you're looking for an insightful narritave or deep character interactions, look elsewhere.",

I for one have a bizarre fascination with light waves and colors and this sates my fascination more than any other program I've seen. Couple that with your own choice of music (I prefer calm, electronic music), and you've got something very relaxing to enjoy. Much like sitting with a cup of hot tea next to a fireplace.",

I tried playing with both my mouse/keyboard and a controller, and both were equally problematic. The game also can get really hectic at times, and it's really difficult to understand what's going on. To its credit, I did not experience that many glitches and no crashes, which is (sadly) rare for any titles these day.  I really want to recommend The Polynomial, but I can't. The music is poor (at best), the execution is a little sloppy -- I mean, hang on. Let me rephrase that. The MECHANICS are poor. The way it's laid out is very beautiful, but it's mechanically very clunky. A good number of times I found myself saying 'Wait, why am I over here now? I didn't want to be over here, I wanted to be over there!'   So no, sorry. The Polynomial does not get my recommendation. Also, the 'test achievement'? Not exactly the most professional looking.
