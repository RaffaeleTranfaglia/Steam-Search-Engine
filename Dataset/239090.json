            "review_text": "So much fun, but two major flaws: for a 15 dollar game, there just isn't really enough. It's AMAZING fun, don't get me wrong, but there's only so much you can do with two modes, the second of which at first glance isn't heavily different from the other (Versus and Survival). My other problem is that there's just not clear communication with some parts of the game - sometimes you'll win even if you have less than 10 kills, or a showdown will end and nothing will happen.   It's extremely solid as a game and I commend the focus on no-online cause it really does shine on couch versus, but there just isn't enough in this for a full price recommendation in my eyes.",

There is a single player survival mode but the game really shines when you play with companions. The game lacks online multiplayer, which, for some, will be a killer. However, online latency would probably decrease the percision of Samurai Gunn so this feature is not missed by me. The game is a tad bit expensive for some. But the game provides a polish that is well worth the cost. Consider buying this game if you have a group of friends that play games together. The game is especially good for a steam box in the living room.",

            "review_text": "Samurai Gunn is a fast paced arena style 'Bushido-Brawler.' It's extremely easy to pick up and have hours of fun on the couch with your buddies. From the 10 life/kill Death Match to the life or death Shogun Showdown, the battles get intense.  Only having 3 bullets in your chamber makes ranged battle high stakes, but worth calculating. You have the ability to block strikes with your sword, but whoever swings second goes flying in the opposite direction, making battles even more dangerous when traps are activated or when the floors are spiked.  Although the price may seem steep for a local 'party-game' this day and age, the single-player survival mode redeems the price. Some may disagree, however the difficulty starts strong and only gets more difficult with each level. It's a challenge not to be over looked.  Overall I'd say Samurai Gunn is an 8/10 and worth a purchase regardless, but it's even more worth a purchase if you have three friends with game pads to decapitate each other. It'd be difficult to implement online capabilities since the controls are heavily based on precise timing, therefore latency would cause issues. This game is exactly where it needs to be, and provides hours of entertainment regardless of couch-buddies.",

Well The game is great +A game based on multiplayer allows you to play with up to three friends locally (Unfortuently) in either versus mode or surivival. +Even if you don't have local friends or the paitence to convince some biast friends you can still play by yourself as any of four factions with multiple skins. +Lots of maps. Did I forget to mention there is a butt load of maps? Anything from moving bamboo to moving industrial blocks to snow to BLAAAAAAAAAAH +Awesome blood/death sequences. The screen will pause momentarily when you kill someone and it is amazing. +YOU CAN BLOCK SWORDS AND BULLETS! When someone swings you can parry their attack and both of you get stunned. it makes for epic multiplayer battles. +Limited bullets make for fast paced gameplay  The bad -I have had local players 'Camp' in high places or in a spawn and just spam attack. -I have fallen through the map before and returned locked inbetween the surface -Bullets tear right through you. Their distance is not limited. -The sword doesn't seem to leave it's sheathe. The swinging animation just looks like a white mass. -The AI are very dumb and get trapped in the moving parts of the map and either get gltiched or crushed. It makes for a lame fight. Fun for multiplayer though. :D -I have no friends.   Overally it is a very good game. I can be fun for parties or just by yourself....plus it's pretty cheap! :D",

Either use your swift sword or fire you gun at range, but be weary, there is a limit on how fast you can strike with your sword, making it demand precision, and your firearm only has 3 bullets each life which can be deflected with the sword. On top of all of that, the stages themselves have interactable objects that can help/hurt you. Get 3 friends with you and play coop survival or go head to head to see just whose chi is heightened. No friends? No problem. The survival mode can be played solo as well. Only complaint from me is the price for such a simple game without a ton of content. All things considered, this is a fast, fun, adrenaline fueled combat game that can keep you occupied longer than intended. 8 out of 10",
