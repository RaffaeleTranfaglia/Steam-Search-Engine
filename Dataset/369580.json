Secondly, this game is extremely accessible to all computers unlike GTAV with its high PC standards to not have your eyes burn. Thirdly and lastly, NotGTAV shares all other aspects of GTAV such as the nudity, gore, police chases, story, etc. In the end, I realized that I wasted money on the actual GTAV when I could have got this game for far much cheaper and with more playablility.

You are constantly in the action, running ♥♥♥♥ over with a tractor, cart, or car. I really feel like I am a part of the story and I become deeply emmerssed in the gameplay. Whenever I am looking to unwind and have some fun, I always find myself gravitating towards this amazing title.  The gameplay is smooth and highly optimized for PC. The controls work perfectly with no delay at all. The voice acting and music is what really takes the cake though, the time that went in to composing and performing the music in this masterpiece is astonishing.

However, nearly instantly upon starting the game you realize it has nothing to offer. Humour is so poorly executed to the point where I wonder if other raters were payed off to kick this game up to 'Very positive'. Only positive thing about it is that it claims that all of the profits are going to charity, which honestly I feel it should be no other way at all. However, just choose a charity and donate money directly. Skip this title.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Graphics: 2 / 10 Poor, choppy graphics. Art at the level of elementary grader.   Sounds: 1 / 10 Often confusing and poorly optimised sound containing not really original or funny jokes. often just random noises and gibberish.  Controls: 0 / 10 Game does not utilize mouse controls at all, suggesting really poor, begginer level programming. Controls themself consist of pressing movement keys to move the snake in a tile-per-tile pattern.  Gameplay: 0 / 10 Game itself is only about 20 minutes long and at the same time very repeatative. Nothing than the few icons changes (you are either a car, or a cart).  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  P.S. for developers. + From the game and appearance of the same on steam I understand that the developers realize most of these things already. A project game that used the GTAV hype to get on steam but in reality has not much to offer takes all the profits to charity. That is a nice gesture that I do support.  All developers (including myself), have started low, with similar projects that try to make the learning curve more fun for themself and I support this. You gathered experience in programming, art style, working with steam and with people. However, when it comes to my rating of the game, please also have in mind that these are intended as a quality check for a market. Only objective thoughts on the game. Best wishes for the future!",

To start off with, this game is meant to be primarily humorous, if you buy this game, it's because it's going to be something that amuses you and makes you laugh. However, if your sense of humor is anything like mine, then you're not going to laugh, and all you're left with is a tedious, badly designed game.  It plays like snake. You know the one, the old atari snake, where you're moving on a 4 directional plane with a tail behind you. If you've played snake, you've played this game, only I prefer snake. There are obstacles to avoid, and different events which all play out the same way every time across all three 'campaigns', only increasingly difficult.  It has so little to do with GTAV that it's kind of skeevy how they used its likeness to get attention and purchases. The only aspects of this game in common with GTAV is you play as 3 seperate characters, the word 'heist' is shoehorned in, and.. that's it really.   The humor is largely political and social, and I'm under the assumption that the political humor is largely related to a specific event and person over in the UK, so if you're an American like me, or really any other place that isn't the UK or you're not versed on world politics, you're not going to get those jokes.  The social humor is predictable and dumb.   Every campaign goes the same way... you run some things over, then the next phase is running away from something, then you run over something specific, then theres another phase of running away from something, then there's a 'heist' where you go top down over the chracter within a room and grab items of some kind while either avoiding or slaughtering the other people in the room depending on if you took the Stealthy or Brutal route. This process is only made slightly harder across the other campaigns, but its mostly just reskinned.   There's also some hardcore mode difficulty which I haven't and am unlikely to ever play.  The art style I think is supposed to be quirky or deliberately trashy looking, but it ends up just coming off as lazy. The crayon drawing equivalent art and scanned handrawn work patched together into vague animation does not appeal to me, and I grew quickly tired of looking at it.  The voice acting is maybe decent on its own, but the dialogue I found to be wretched. It's also repeated.. constantly. Constantly you will hear the same f**king dialogue spouted, and it gets so old so fast that at certain points I had to take off my headset.   All in all, if this games style of humor appeals to you, it's worth the 74 cents my friend paid for it. But if you don't like the jokes, then there's nothing about this game that is worth the money.   Recommended if you like the humor. Not recommended if you don't.",
