            "review_text": "A simple dodgeball arena game. Decent music and graphics, colorful world and uses the blocky human style similar to games like Minecraft and Thirty Flights of Loving. A decent lighthearted nonsensical story and voices are only in (although subtitles are available for multiple languages).  Rules are pretty simple: Game starts with the single ball dropping in the center of the arena. You can throw, pass, dodge, or catch the ball. You can also do a melee shove to make an opponent drop the ball. Two hits within a couple seconds knocks you out (permanently in harder modes or until your partner revives you in easier modes). And there are often random objects in the environment that can be thrown (only for the first hit; the ball is needed for the second hit).  The campaign is 12 missions with three optional challenges per mission (such as eliminating an opponent with a curving long shot). While the first-to-three regular dodgeball matches were fine, I had more fun with the bosses (which are less dodgeball and more action game). The AI companion is good enough as medium-skill partner (it almost always passes the ball to you to make the shot and can dodge decently) but it's not good enough to handle the harder AI or well coordinated humans. Sometimes it'll make a terrible mistake and randomly get knocked out or pass the ball to the enemy but I've made mistakes just as bad. Just don't rely on it and treat it as an extra life/a ball collector.  In the higher difficulties you have to keep your eye out for incoming projectiles and use your dodge roll perfectly. Otherwise the enemy will just hit you once your roll ends. It can just become a series of throws into catches/dodges until one side gets a lucky hit.  While I had my x360 controller plugged in, it became the sole method of control. No option to switch controls. While fine for me (I don't keep my controller plugged in all the time), may be annoying for those who do. Controls are remappable for keyboard but not controller. The diagram showing controller controls didn't show the pass button (RB for me).  Unfortunately, there is only local coop (no online multiplayer). At least you can do the campaign as coop.  Some things I'd like to have:   Better outlined text. Sometimes the font blends together and is hard to read (Especially the red team victory screen)   Actual volume sliders instead of having to cycle through all options to lower the volume   An option to constrain the mouse cursor to the window in windowed mode   An option to automatically pause the game when it goes out of focus   To be able to toggle challenge descriptions instead of it disappearing and reappearing every few seconds. Makes it a little annoying to read. Or the descriptions could be separate from the flower showing if you already completed the challenge.   While playing I saw some visual bugs but nothing too severe. There were some model clipping issues in cutscenes and a random scratch line across the dialogue box. Thought the scratch might have been on my actual screen but it followed the window when I moved it.  Worth a look if arcadey/gamey dodgeball interests you and you don't mind the presentation/silly theme. It allows you to skip cutscenes (hold space on keyboard) if you find the story/characters grating.",

Now it does have its flaws, and you might want to configure your controls (i had to configure the curve because C to curve was not working out for me) but other than that, you can tell it was made by Russians? (I don't know the accent, but i can tell it wasn't American.) Now i don't mind the culture of the developer, but I think he/her/them should get some dubbed actors. It's kind of sad for me to having to read during the cutscenes although, it's not that big of a deal. Now the cons are awesome, I am on a Toshba windows 10 and the graphics are amazing for this game, and i'm surprised my PC can run it in High Quality. The gameplay is pretty awesome, the characters are kind of annoying but it doesn't really matter. It's kind of a goofy game in my opinion, it doesn't have real competive wish is what i think was the dev's intention. It would be awesome if the dev had some kind online multiplayer so I can get my freinds to buy the game, when we have game night we are bored out of our minds by the same games, so this would give us another variety. This reveiw probably makes no sense mostly because I'm making it when I just woke up XD, but i hope this helps.",

I connected 4 controllers and my TV to my PC for a party and it was easily the best $10.00 I've ever spent in my life.  The steam pics don't do this game enough justice. I had very low hopes for this game, and grabbed it on a whim, but you have to trust me on this -- it's hysterical. The music, the gameplay, all the little sneak moves you can do, the wierd 70's porn vibe the game has ... just trust me.  If you're having a co-op party, BUY THIS GAME. You're welcome.",
