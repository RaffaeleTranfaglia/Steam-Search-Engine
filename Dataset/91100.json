The graphics are beautiful, the landscape is stunning, the entire game is fantastic! This game is similar to BLUR, but with airplanes. Don't worry, it's not easy at all, it's challenging even at the first few maps! This game is underrated and overlooked by any means. WORTH IT! The only flaw however: no split-screen 2 player mode.",

The only problem is that on the last Levels the game is too hard. Medium difficult looks like Impossible (I still can't beat the last race in 1st place - got 2nd only), the AI is a pain. Overall it is a good game, kinda short and the replay vallue is good. Too bad the community is dead, cause I can't complete the online achievements.",

            "review_text": "SkyDrift is a fun, slightly non-serious racing/combat game. Unlike most racing titles, where you drive cars, here you're flying airplanes of varying types.   The first thing I noted was the graphics, which in my opinion, were fantastic. Admittedly, it's sometimes difficult to notice detail when you're flying at high speeds through caverns, dodging enemy fire and launching missiles their way in return. Regardless, the visuals are impressive.  The audio is decent. Nothing to complain about, but nothing to rave about either. The music is good and the sound effects work nicely. My one gripe (and it's a minor one) is the announcer, whose voice is a bit annoying. Then again, I generally dislike announcers in any game, so take my opinion with a grain of salt.  The controls are tight and responsive with a gamepad, which is something you'll want. The keyboard works well too, but there are times you'll wish you had an analogue stick. I don't know if flight sticks are supported.  The single player part of the game has practice runs, time trials, and real races. The multiplayer component is supposedly similar. I wouldn't know since I haven't tried it. I imagine that, like any racing game, lag can have a huge impact on racing performance.   One last thing I'd like to comment on is the design of the planes you fly. They're often odd and sometimes outlandish. I like that, given the fact the game isn't supposed to be realistic. It also reminds me of an old PC game entitled Crimson Skies, which handled similarly, although the game's content was much different.  All in all, I'd recommend SkyDrift if you like racing games (with combat) and you're ltired of driving cars. Just don't mistake this game for a serious simulation, as it's most definitely arcade action all the way.",

This game is something different though...you race with planes. And not only that, but the controls are so tight, you'd swear every time you played it was your first time.  Seriously though, if you love racers with tight controls, genuinely challenging AI to battle when not with friends and a bounty of pick-ups to choose from and use against opponents, then this is the racing game for you!  Oh yeah, friends. Have I not mentioned yet that this game is multiplayer? Cause it is. It's well worth it for even the default price of £6.99 and its a heck of alot of fun.",

That said, at ten dollars what's here is extremely polished. Just be sure to bring a gamepad (and maybe buy a few copies for your online friends.)",

My only real complaint is the lack of race tracks. There is only 5, all of which have can be reversed (to make 10). If there were more tracks this game would have much more play value. I feel the multiplayer is where this game would stride, but with a small community it can be frustrating to find people to play with. Over all this game is definitely worth the $10.",
