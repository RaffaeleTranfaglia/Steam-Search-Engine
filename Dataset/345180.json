            "review_text": "Foreword: I wish steam counted the time I played Victor Vran in offline mode... I should easily be over 12 hours and I own the game since a few days ago - and that is saying something...  What's Victor Vran? Take the Diablo series (if you don't know what Diablo 1-2-3 is, you most likely don't like or care about isometric ARPGs, so you're better off closing this review now), remove its class system, and add the following: jumping and dodging; Guild Wars 2 style of combat (skills tied to the weapon type); way better voice actors (Doug Cockle, the Witcher 3's Geralt and Andrew Wincott as the Voice); good humor and easter eggs that break the leveling tedium, and last, but not least, just tell me in what other game you can do Gangnam Style in Kung Lao's Hat!? If it were only throwable too...  So, let's take a look at the good and the bad.  The GOOD: 1. Great artwork and level design - extremely well made locations ranging from city streets, labyrinths, caves, halls to various dungeons. 2. Great flashy combat animations - they really do justice to the title, even if the graphics are more reminiscent of a 2012 game than a 2015. 3. Great music - the soundtracks are very dark, sinister and thematic. Even during the Gangnam style easter egg scene. 4. Great voice actors - Doug Cockle, Andrew Wincott and Elena Saurel do an amazing job in this game. I also felt like Elena Saurel tries to immitate Triss at times and sound like her... Might just be me though. Too much Witcher 3, you know... 5. Great protagonist - Victor Vran, the bulky demon hunter with a husky voice, the worst pickup lines ever and a voice in his head that both helps and misleads, jokes and makes fun of him is just awesome. And about that... 6. There aren't many ARPGs that can put a smile on your face. This one does though - just when you start feeling bored with all the button mashing, either Victor Vran, the Voice, a monster, or a Boss shows up to crack a joke or do something funny. 7. Innovates the ARPG genre - you can jump, wall jump, and dodge roll to either reach an area, a secret, avoid damage, or strategically position yourself in a fight. It makes an AMAZING difference in comparison to other ARPGs. I am sure masters of the game will abuse this mechanic a lot to avoid damage and set up perfect combos. 8. Great weapon variety for both close, ranged, and mixed style-oriented 'Vrans' - I was pleasantly surprised to discover that there is no obsolete weapon type in this game. 90% of the time you can easy build around the type of weapon you prefer (or want to run with) by improving on its strengths. The other 10% represent encounters where other weapon types work better than the one you currently predominantly use, or objectives that require you to complete some fights with a different weapon to get a reward. 9. Even without classes, builds are possible - there are plenty of options in the game that you can mix and match to create efficient builds. You have your weapon with various prefixes and suffixes, outfit (but no armor pieces), destiny cards, demonic powers and potions. You can opt to build for melee-tank, melee-dps, ranged with crits, big demon power usage, etc. There are plenty of variations to keep you occupied. 10. Set your own challenge - by selecting various hexes that affect you or the enemies upon entering an instance, you can increase the difficulty of an area and improve the awards gained from it - and of course, brag about your badassness. 11. Every area has a task-reward system to it - I wouldn't call it a quest, really. Upon entering an area, you will be given a number of tasks you can strive to complete (or completely skip) with rewards like gold, xp, items, destiny cards, and so on tied to them. I find this a very nice touch, as it makes me think about something else than the mindless button mashing or grinding. 12. Just like any ARPG, you can get your grind on in a major way - while you can absolutely do any instance just once or rush through the game, the completionist Vrans will endeavour to look under every nook and cranny, find all the secrets, do all the tasks, reap all the rewards, and redo areas as many times as it takes to complete everything. 13. Awesome controller scheme - while controller usage is not a commonplace in ARPGs, Victor Vran does a stellar job integrating it. I am an all-out keyboard-and-mouse pc gamer, and I have been playing this title for about 12 hours with the controller. That is indeed saying something, so if you're more used to the controller, you will absolutely love the fact that they implemented it to such great extent. 14. And mind you, this is purely subjective - I am personally done with grindy ARPGs and MMOS that take over 100 hours to complete. I am also over games that make me see the better way halfway through it, and because of the player that I am, I always restart to correct my mistakes... I did my fair share of them (over 2000 hours total in Diablo 1-2-3, over 1500 hours in Lineage 2 and over 2500 hours in Guild Wars 2) and I am all for 20-25 hour ARPGs right now, and this is why Victor Vran is the right game for me. Here you can just play - and fix the errors in your ways by swapping your builds on the fly. 15. 4 player co-op - always a great thing to see!  And now, let's take a look at the bad: 1. Passable story - while the story is serviceable, do not expect anything amazingly epic. Someone screws up, you go fix it. That simple. No more, no less. 2. Semi-RPG mechanics - while builds are an option based on mixing-matching the options given to you, the ARPG fans are used to way more in terms of min-maxing a character, with more skills, build options that make every class play differently and so on and so forth. Victor Vran does another serviceable, but by no means stellar job. It is nowhere near the likes of Diablo, Torchlight, Path of Exile, and Sacred 1&amp;2 where you have tons of classes, you could shop, gamble, and grind for hours to make the best build. However, it is also not as pointless as the one in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows where you were leveling up without even realizing it... 3. Replayability - steam says I am about 6 hours in, it is incorrect. I am about 12 hours in and I still have plenty of things to do. So I would venture to say that a single run would take anywhere from 15 to 19 hours, and over 20 if you are more fastidious and like to clear every single monster from an area and complete every single objective. This might be a turn-off to some gamers, and while to me in isn't, it is a fair point that I also need to put out there. 4. A number of bosses so far really made me sweat and switch builds before tackling them... Boss battles in this game are hard, and yes, the one-hit-kill mechanic is present, and profoundly frustrating. 5. No armor customization - while the outfits in this game are awesome, ranging from Dapper Vrans to Savage Vrans, the customization there is barren, as it is a whole piece. Yeah... no gloves, boots, torso, hat, amulet, ring, etc.  CONCLUSION: Victor Vran is the right game for me, so it gets an easy recomendation. If you like action packed ARPGs with good amount of loot, lots of stuff to kill (as you'll be tripping on enemies every second step you take) and a side serving of humor alongside it, this game is absolutely the right one for you. I also believe that by the time I am posting the review, it is still on sale, so it should be a great buy. Anything over 33% off the title makes it a must own. You will absolutely get the full value for your money, even moreso if you decide to try another playstyle. The satisfying combat, the loot system, the amount of achievements, challenges, easter eggs, and the funny narrator are very strong selling points to this game. It is only held back by its mediocre story and incomplete customization (i.e. no classes and armor pieces). If you can live with these flaws, this game is absolutely the right one for you.",

            "review_text": "So! I present you Victor Vran! I was keeping an eye on this little game when it was on early access and I got it shortly after its release. I must say, I am not dissapointed.  WHAT I FOUND INTERESTING ♦It has up to 4 player story coop, so you are never bored. My friend purchased 4pack and we are having so much fun playing. ♦No difficult RPG levelling, this game is friendly to all the players even casuals. ♦Friendly controls. You can chose how you want to play the game - on the keyboard, gamepad or a classic Diablolike controls. ♦Many ways to play - as you level up you get a change to change your characters outfit and with it its look and adjust the gameplay to you suitable playstyle. At the beginning of the game you can chose form the basic 4 outfits, but you can change it at any time when you get the chance. Each player outfit has different bonuses. ♦Ability to set your own difficulty. In later play you will get access to 'hexes'. You can enable one or more of those to increase the difficulty of your play, and you can disable them at any time, or just play without them.  WHAT I DONT LIKE ○Might get repetetive after a while for some people. But there might be someone who will enjoy it anyway. Like me. ○Bosses are not really a challenge when you play in coop. But it usually vary, depending on the boss. Some were very difficult even when playing together with friends. ○Not very good enemy variation. You will encounter same enemies all over again. ○Not so memorable characters in the story.  MINOR STUFF +visuals +weird Voice that talks all the time and something cracks stupid joke, easter egg, reference or bad pun. +skeletons dancing Gangnam style  IN THE END This game is worth playing. If you dont like playing deep RPG of this genre, this is a very nice and welcoming game.  Dear developers. Thank you.",

            "review_text": "Victor Vran, from developer Haemimont Games, is an action role-playing game with entertaining gameplay elements that are a result of its bold design concepts. While the game begins slowly, it significantly improves as players level their characters and gain new abilities. It's not until players unlock all the gameplay basics that the game truly shines with its attempts at new concepts for the genre, such as a hex system to increase difficulty in levels. Yet the game faces tough competition in the action RPG genre with other games such as Diablo III, Grim Dawn and Path of Exile. Even if it doesn't have all the features of other genre titles, what it does contain is gameplay that is difficult to put down after hours and hours of slaying monsters, leveling up, and gaining more loot.  This action-RPG follows the story of Victor Vran, a wandering demon hunter in search of an old friend that went missing near the town of Zagorovia. You quickly learn the city and surrounding area have been taken over by demons and other monsters, making it an ideal place for demon hunters to investigate. Victor is then greeted by a disembodied voice, referred to as The Voice, which taunts Victor relentlessly. I won’t go into too much more detail since the story picks up the pace early but, I will say that The Voice is one of the best parts about the game. He brings comic relief to the dark and gloomy Gothic-esque setting, even going so far as to making some subtle jokes referring to Skyrim and The Stanley Parable. Moreover, The Voice’s dialogue is non-intrusive to the progression of the game, meaning the game doesn’t come to a screeching halt every time he wants to make a quip at our hero.  The main story is interesting and engaging, but seems somewhat inconsequential. I will admit this is very much a subjective opinion, but the game would have played out the same without a story; I can still hack and slash through mountains of demons and undead to reach the next zone without a reason to do so other than it’s fun to see if I can. The story just seemed to put me on an arbitrary path from one zone to the next.   Victor Vran offers no specific classes to choose from but instead uses an equipment based skill system. This means there are no skill points earned to spec into particular attributes like crit chance, just weapon stats and destiny cards. These cards act like slottable skill points; each card has a point value and a passive effect. You start with a limited number of card slots and number of total points among slotted cards. I found this system was very useful when I wanted to try different build types, but after I found a play style I liked I only changed my cards when I found stronger versions of the ones I already had. I appreciate the thought they gave to trying this method of character progression, but it lacks the kind of depth or variety I want from an RPG.  On a similar note is the demon power system. You start with a single slot and quickly unlock a second through leveling. These powers can drop as loot and and have varying levels of rarity like all the other lootable items. Of the ones I was able to find, some were definitely more useful than others. The offensive powers didn’t seem to do enough damage later in the game and one in particular requires you to be stationary to channel the ability. In a game with waves of enemies, you might be able to see the problem with this; standing still is a death sentence and the damage from the column of fire you summon doesn’t mitigate that at all. I mostly stuck to defensive demon powers like the time bubble and diamond armor since my weapons did enough damage on their own.   The weapons, in fact, are the core of the gameplay. They decide how fast you’re attacking and the other two skills you can equip. Unlike most RPGs where you might unlock certain abilities with skill points, Victor Vran has you switching abilities every time you switch weapon types. While this means you can’t specifically upgrade weapon skills, it does mean you can change out your abilities at will. This was actually very useful for taking on different zones and bosses; sometimes a horde of skeletons needed to be cleared with the smash attack of a giant hammer, other times attacking a boss at range using a pistol was the safest choice. These are all personal choices of course, but I felt the level design was nudging me to use the skills from a particular weapon over the skills of another.   So now you have a demon hunter with a pistol and a hammer who can shoot flames and slow down ranged attacks, but how does it size up to the waves of enemies you’re fighting? The game claims to have a “huge variety in monster behaviour,” but it really boils down to melee and ranged. Most of them, regardless of attack method, simply charge you head on like the 28 Day Later zombies while others dart around like a cracked out house fly. Others yet simply dance around you and just want you to dance with them.   Honestly the monster variety seems exhausted pretty quick and you learn how to fight around their mechanics, but the real test of skill are the boss battles. I was getting a little bored grinding through waves of skeletons and wraiths until I came across the first boss a couple hours in. It was a giant spider amid hundreds of eggs that hatched more spiders. It was a real turning point in the game for me. I wasn’t just fighting a wave of enemies, but now a wave of enemies and a giant spider that could slow and stun me. It was the first time I had to think about how to handle the whole situation instead of just hack/slash/shoot my way through. I would even go so far as to say that battle and the subsequent boss battles are the best test of combat and are what kept me wanting to play more.  The art style is reminiscent of Diablo 3 and other popular isometric RPGs, but that’s mostly because the fantasy Gothic setting is a fairly well established style at this point. The character art during dialogue is very well done and depicts each character’s role. A nice touch that I appreciate is when you change Victor’s outfit, his portrait for dialogues is updated. The textures and models are good enough for how high the camera sits, but honestly the combat is usually so fast paced you rarely get time to check out how good the monsters look. What matters is that you can tell a fireball-shooting skeleton from a melee skeleton and you can do that with ease. Victor Vran might not incorporate Nvidia Hair Physics, but it doesn’t hurt to look at.   The music, on the other hand, is more than adequate. I found myself humming the eerie themes throughout the day after playing the night before. The score fits the setting perfectly and provides a great backdrop for pummeling waves of undead creatures in an overrun city. The sound effects are good too, giving the feeling of impact for your weapons. I found this especially true for the ranged weapons and the extra punch from landing a crit.   Victor Vran is a solid action-RPG, no doubt about it. I was hoping for more depth and permanence in the skill system like you might find in more traditional RPGs, but I can appreciate the choices the developers made given the core mechanic of the game: fast-paced combat with a variety of weapons and enemies. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of action-RPGs with more of a focus on combat and less on character building.",

            "review_text": "There are 2 types of ARPG. One that requires many many hours of grinding items to min/max them and the other where you play a game once or twice and you have done it all.   Victor Vran is the later.  It's pretty unique ARPG. You can roll and jump and double jump from the walls. There is a pretty decent amount of verticality . You can rotate the camera (even tho I would still have prefered ISO over free camera - it's more annoying than helpful). Gear system feels fresh and quite to play with. I've read that's also good to play with a controller, but I'm a fan of 'keyboard and mouse' so I played the game with this set.  There are no skills like in Diablo or Path of Exile or Grim Dawn, but every single item type has 2 individual skills. You can choose to play with sickle, sword, rapier, magic book, shotgun, lightning gun and grenade launcher + you can quickly switch between them for some pretty awesome combos. And that's not all. There are 'Demon Powers' too which you have to charge by hitting monster. They can vary from offensive ones (meteors, earth tremors and so on) to defensive ones (hp regeneration, damage absorption, etc.) And when you play with this whole package the gameplay feels very fluid and fun and sometimes even challenging.  The one thing that kept me playing this game - the objectives. Victor Vran has many different areas that you can play in. Every area has 5 different objectives (kill x amount of monster with that type of gun or with demon power, or avoid taking damage while killing monsters and such). Those objectives reward you with xp or gold + you feel awesome when you complete them too ^^. If you fail one or two - you can just restart an area and try to complete those failed ones once again. Pretty simple. Most of the objectives are moderately easy, some are really annoying and some of them require to move your butt quickly because of the timer ^^.  Overall - it's a great simple ARPG, with good graphics, good voice acting, forgettable music and fun gameplay.   ",

            "review_text": " The Circle of Loot   Baldur's gate, Diablo, Torchlight, you know where you stand with a good action RPG.  You build your character, enter the game world and hack and slash your way through hordes of monsters on a quest for lovely loot, loot which will make you more powerful, so you can take down more bad guys and get even more lovely loot.  It's a tried and tested format, it works and for the most part Victor Vran sticks to the staples of the genre, but is does bring a few interesting idea's of its own to the table.    Victor of Rivia   When you dive into Victor Vran the first thing you'll notice is the voice of Victor himself. You're going to recognise it, at least you will if you've played the Witcher games recently.  Every ones favourite white haired witcher is voiced by an actor called Doug Cockle, Doug has now bought his talents to bear by giving voice to Victor Vran. Which is great, he's a talented guy, but I did struggle with it a little, if only because Victor Vran is the first game I've sank a decent amount of time into following completion of The Witcher 3.  The problem I had was that every time Victor opened his mouth I heard the Witcher speaking which had the undesired effect of distracting me from Victors world and reminding me of Geralts. It's only a little thing but when the small voice in your head keeps asking 'What's Geralt doing here?' it can't help but break the immersion a little.    Padding around Zagoravia   The next thing you'll probably think is: 'Hey, there's no camera zoom' closely followed by 'These controls are weird' Both of which are true.  The first thing I tried to do in game was zoom the camera out by scrolling the mouse wheel, but instead of the camera moving as I'd expected, Victor did a backwards roll, which of course led to the second thought 'These controls are weird'.  Well the default mouse controls are weird anyway. This is easily fixed in the game options but I'd strongly recommend playing with a controller if you have one. It makes a world of difference to the feel of the game.  Unfortunately the inflexible camera is not so easily fixed. The ability to pan the camera up and down as well as zoom in and out would have made navigating the world Haemimont Games have created a much simpler task.    Victor Vran Helsing   You'll be playing as the self titled Victor Vran, he looks a lot like Van Helsing doesn't he? Anyway... Victor is demon hunter, he's not a mage, not a paladin or a priest, he's not even a vampire slayer, he's a demon hunter. There's no class selection here, Geralt was a Witcher, Mario was a Plumber, Victor is a Demon Hunter, that's just who he is.  Having said that, this game does still have an element of class customisation, it's just more subtle than you'll probably be used to from other ARPG's you've played.    The Clothes Make The Man   You will, quite literally start tailoring your character from the very beginning of the game. After you've finished the brief tutorial by way of rotating the camera and squishing a few spiders you'll be given a choice of three outfits, each one will slightly change the way your character generates 'overdrive'.  What's overdrive? That's your 'Mana', the resource you use when you're spell casting or rather 'using your demonic powers', but we'll talk about that later.  So you'll be given the option of three outfits, Hunter, Cavalier or Vigilante.  The Hunter outfit generates overdrive when you're damaged. (This is the balanced play option).  Vigilante focuses on armour and only grants overdrive when you land a critical hit (this is your 'warrior' focused play style).  Cavalier generates overdrive automatically over time. (This gives a little more emphasis towards spell casting).  Don't make the mistake of thinking you can play as a mage though, there's no class selection remember, you're a demon hunter, you gain demonic abilities (spells) as you play through the game but you are limited to only having two of these equipped at any one time.  This is a hack and slash title, you can use magic to supplement your slashing and hacking but it can't replace it.    Progress for the Victor   You can further tweak your character to suit your play style as you progress through the game, there's no RPG style skill set to level here though, you manipulate your available abilities through the weapons, powers and destiny cards you equip. This isn't as limiting as it first sounds, there are plenty of variations you can try out. It's a fresh and interesting approach to character progression, it just takes a little getting used to.    Weapon of Choice   There are plenty of weapons for you to loot or buy in the game, each type bringing its own flavour to combat.  The Rapier is ideal if you're looking for some fast 'staby, staby' action.  The sword is your hack and slash staple, it's a little slower than the Rapier but swinging it around will damage multiple enemies if they're bunched up tight.  There's the scythe for some wider spread slashing mayhem and the hammer for some slow and heavy squishing.  These are just the melee weapon types, there are various shotguns, electric zappers etc. to choose from for your ranged attacks too.  Every weapon comes with a standard attack and two special attack abilities, each of which is distinctive and noticeably different between weapon types. You can equip two weapons at a time (once you've progressed far enough to unlock this ability) and switching between them is quick and easy so you'll have multiple options available to suit whatever situation you find yourself in.    Might and Magic the Gathering   Magic in the game takes the form of Demonic Powers, again there are plenty to pick up throughout the game but as I said earlier, you can only equip two at a time so you're not going to able to play through Victor Vran solely as a spell wielding mage  Whatever your characters wardrobe and equipment you're going to need to get your hands dirty with some melee combat. However the spells offer some satisfying options in combat to supplement your might with a blade, whether it's raining down meteors on unsuspecting enemies or throwing up a shield to the damage those endless hordes are throwing at you.  Destiny cards serve as the passive ability mechanic in the game. You can equip up to five of these cards (depending on your level) which grant various passive abilities from increased health to damage bonuses which will further customise your character to suit your play style. They're a nice touch and give a tired mechanic a fresh feeling. I like destiny cards.    Location, Location, Vocation.   This is a real hack and slash title which follows a well trodden path and apart from the quirky character 'progression' it plays exactly as you would expect it too.  You have a home hub (The castle) and travel to various locations to deal with the horrible hordes that reside there. There's no open world here though, you select a location from the map and instantly appear there ready take on the demonic dwellers within.  Hacking the horrors is a huge amount of fun, the different weapon types and their respective special attacks are all satisfying to use and help to keep the combat fresh (although it can still start to feel a little repetitive if you're playing through a marathon session.)  There are secret locations to be found too which will contain treasure chests full of looty goodness, often these will need you to use a rare and unusual ability, the ability to jump...    Victor Vran Halen (You might as well Jump!)   That's right, Victor Vran is an ARPG with allows you to Jump! It's a really nice touch and not one you...

There are many clever secrets that hit the right spot of being 'fun to find', but not 'too tedious to find'. In terms of humor: it's hit-or-miss, but at least there's a lot of it. There is a soldier called Stash. Private Stash. He manages your... private... stash. So yeah, lots of dadjokes. If you like that sort of thing, you'll have a great time.  The story could've had a bit more to it, but I suppose the money runs out quickly when you hire Geralt of Rivia to voice the main character :) It still has its moments, but this is more of a gameplay-driven experience.",

Fight off loads of monsters with your equipped weapons and demon powers, while trying to discover why there is such an outbreak of monsters and so many of your fellow hunters dead.

Finish some maps, and come back to the hub to trade with NPCs, stash items away, hear what new things they might have to say, and then head back out to do a new quest.  As you level up you'll earn the ability to equip a second weapon, a second demon power, multiple divination cards (which can do a great number of things), and more.   Fighting off hordes of monsters is really satisfying, and the story seems pretty interesting. A very enjoyable game.",

I'll point out some aspects of the game I liked first:  Pros ~Multiplayer that isn't a hassle. ~Full range of interesting weapons. ~Customizable builds based on style of play. For instance, if you want to tank, there is a setup for that.  ~Said setup is made based on Destiny Cards. These aren't too hard to find (some given during level-ups). ~Diablo-style legendary items (no sets). The weapons I got that had legendary effects were fun to use and I tried my hardest to keep them in my inventory at all times. ~Able to change loadout on the fly. ~Large amount of inventory, even for those pesky low-level cards that you need to hoard. ~Boss fights that will keep you on your toes  Now this was my experience before around level 25. After this the gameplay changed, and so did the need for new ways of tackling the game.  Cons ~Getting certain items in multiplayer (esp. lightning guns) will kill your friends in a heartbeat if they are melee. Friendly fire should not have been included. ~Some legendary weapons are too OP to pass up. ~The game forces you to play at a harder difficulty to obtain said legendaries. ~The increased difficulty creates a huge gap from the original gameplay. It honestly felt like a completely different game. Not just a harder game, an impossible one. Here's why: Enemies can have any Demonic skill in game, including a 5 second stun and pull. No build, even full defense, can handle this later in game. The monsters that can cast this ability are multiplied at this level. You will run into them, and they will murder you. ~Builds become cookie-cutter. Tanks are no longer viable, and the only build you can use includes certain OP legendary items with high-damage output/vamp. ~Money will always be a problem if you decide not to grind. ~You will decide to grind anyway because once you increase the difficulty (which some areas require to pass their achievements) you will run into problems. ~Upgrading cards to have Wicked/Divine stats becomes a larger grind than getting OP weapons. ~Last thing- every area in the game will scale it's difficulty to your level. Going back to old content won't mean easier content.   I became so fustrated with this game after a while and had to stop. I consider myself a common gamer, and this game's difficulty curve is very, very high. Would not recommend to new or softcore gamers. I played this game in multiplayer with a hardcore gamer, and he was happy with the game in it's current state. To all his own.",

So you get to jump, dodge, dive and kill your way through level upon level of hilarious carnage. There are some cringe inducing moments of 'try to hard to be funny' such as dancing undead but other than that an all out slash fest of delight.  You play Victor Vran, a character you more or less won't care much about. He's thrown deep into a city of demons and dungeons. Your only job? Kill things. Your tools to do so? Many. Scythes that stun or spin to win. Lightning guns that fork out balls of justice. Demon powers that will cause boomerangs, sunbursts of deadly force and so on. Oh, and a mysterious voice that seems to follow you everywhere. Speaking of Voice, all you Witcher fans will rejoice, a familiar voice returns. Victor Vran is none other than Doug Cockle. Yup, Geralt.   Do you level? Sure, but the weapon decides the play style. They change from carnage inducing AoE skills to 'holy cow nuke the spider' single target damage and everything between. They're even adding in a caster style Tome so now you can cast like a mage while lookin' like a kick ♥♥♥ hunter in the process.   Is the game hard? So far, not really. But the style and form of the game itself makes it very enjoyable. I think my biggest complaint, remember I'm only at level 18 or so, is that the maps are static. I hear/read that later there is a map that at least changes paths and monsters so maybe that will help it seem more alive.  Am I recomending this? If you don't own it, you're a heathen.

It also has two extra maps for endless battles. One for endless waves of monsters and one with random quests everyday that give you a special currency that you can trade for legendary items.  Overall, so far I enjoy this game a lot, no matter if I play alone (70% of times) or with a friend (30% of times). I gave 7€ to buy the humble bundle just for this game and I didn't regret it.

Smooth gameplay, addicting side quest missions, great graphics and a simple to use UI. Plus any game that features the suave voice of Geralt of Rivia is A-OK in my books. I couldn't really get into the Van Helsing games that are also in the genre and didn't feel the controls were as well done in those either...Victor Vran does a much better job, and they aren't nearly as 'clunky'.

I can only use one hand, so games where you usually have to block/dodge etc. can be hard to do if it requires both keyboard and mouse to execute a certain action that involves moving and blocking/dodging at the same time. The fact that one can actually choose from 3 different options on how to play the game is something more developers should implement in their games. The choice of HOW to play, and make it therefore also more easy for those who love to play games, but can only use one hand. Diablo III is also very playable with one hand. Grim Dawn is another. There are games that are very playable. But the majority of cool games alas do not support it so far.

The Isometric view, the art style, the environments, and even some of the enemies remind me a lot of that series.   Gameplay wise it's a lot like Diablo as well. The combat is very similar.  This is where the similarities end and where Victor Vran becomes it's own unique game.  For starters, after a brief tutorial you're told to pick your clothing. This clothing dictates what type of 'class' (if you can call them that) you'll be playing. From the tutorial you enter the main hub and hang around (transmute, sell, buy, etc...) or go to the map and choose your destination. After you've chosen your destination you're met with a list of challenges. These range from 'Kill x enemies' to 'Find 3 secrets'. Upon completion of said challenges you get new items, gold, and XP.  Secondly, each time you level up you're given the choice of 3 random items. You might want to pick a new card that gives you a health boost or maybe it offers you a weapon (let's hope for rare!). Did I mention the loot is all random as well?   Also, throughout the whole game you're aided and sometimes harassed by a snarky narrator. He's usually pretty funny and I've chuckled quite a bit while listening to him.  Overall, the game is very fun and I found myself saying quite a bit 'Ok, just explore one more area and then head to bed.' An hour later and I'm still not in bed.  PROS: + Sound (music is great!) + Lots of gameplay with more free dlc being added + Unique class system + Gothic and dark style + Narrator + Challenges  CONS: - RNG hasn't really been on my side so far. Not really their fault just something I'd mention. - The environments tend to repeat themselves sometimes  10/10 Would hunt spiders again!  (P.S. I was grasping at straws to find some cons.

I am more than stoked to say that it's amazing and you should definitely pick it up if you are any kind of fan of the ARPG genre. The game has great combat (move camera movement down to 0 and play with a gamepad) even if the story is only servicable, given it's your common 'Van Helsing battles the ooglie booglie' schluck. That's OK though, since the gameplay is exactly what it needs to be and that is all that matters. If you were ever a fan of the older PS2 era Balder's Gate ARPG games (like Balder's Gate: Dark Allliance) you'll feel right at home here. If you, also, enjoyed the semi-recent Gauntlet game, you'll also like this and understand what genre niche it fits into.  BUY IT........SUPPORT THE SYSTEM.......PURCHASE PURCHASE SHEEPLE........GIVE THE MAN YOUr MONEY!!!!!!!!  Pros: The game play is smooth, weapon switching worksk well, powers are fun, and cards give good passives that suit your playstyle. Graphics, also, are very servicable with bright colors and nicely crafted environments.  Cons: backtracking...ugh. The story is kind of 'meh' and told is a underwelling fashion (a lot of static images used in lieu of animated cutscenes or passive storytelling). There isn't a lot of loot in this game either. You'll pick up a decent assortment of weapons but they won't be all that interesting to people who are used to games like Diablo or Torchlight since they often look the same, have very similar base stats, and only differ in random perks assignments. The big issue is this: no armor slots. Instead, they went with a costume system that gives you different perks based on the costume you wear. Unfortunately, this cuts down on player customization since you'll stick with the costume that gives the best perks for your playstyle, even if it's not the one you are most interested in visually.  Either way, the game is a ton of fun and a great way to kill time on your main monitor while you watch pron on your secondary.........  or don't......your choice............though, in my opinion, you're wasting your time (and grip strength).....  What would Solid Snake think? You built up all that grip strength, his name IS Solid, AND you bought the family sized pack of Kleenex from Costco.

            "review_text": "Yeah, it's goofy and good.  To elaborate: Victor Vran pretends it's an APRG in the vein of Diablo. In reality, it's more of an action game with a bunch of RPG elements. There's a lot of buffs and debuffs and damages and armors but most of it can be ignored during the slaughter. The key gameplay mechanics are dodging - something you'll be doing a lot of in the action game way, by rolling from projectiles, jumping over shockwaves and whatnot - and mastering weapons.  There's under twenty weapon types, but each handles differently (by having three attacks associated with it) and each has different mechanics associated with it - so with a shotgun you'll be timing shots and executing enemies, with a scythe you'll harvest souls of and use them to empower your moves and with a rapier you'll be counting your hits to get the maximum out of its combo-empowering abilities.  You can switch between two weapons on the fly and you aren't locked out of any by stat requirements - simply because there aren't any stats. You get passive boosts by equipping a set of cards with values associated with them and figuring out the most effective hand of cards you can use with your limited capacity is actually quite fun.  The emphasis on action gameplay is also further reflected in level design - the maps aren't randomly generated and there is a set of challenges on each one to complete for extra loot and experience; those range from 'accidently fulfilled' to 'good luck figuring out a build that can do this' in difficulty - and if that isn't enough, another set of (really rather ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly) challenges for each map opens up on beating the final boss.   Graphics are nice enough, could use less spiders but that's a pretty common issue with RPG devs running out of ideas. I think this game actually suffered a bit in the story/presentation department by coming out at around the same time as Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing, with which it apparently shares a lot of style - hell, even logo/title screen with a steampunky hatted hunter looking in your general direction. I wouldn't call Victor Vran derivative, though; for one, his hat gets mercilessly mocked throughout the game.  Which brings me to the story and writing and what's actually tying all that murder together. The story is minimal - there's this cursed city and you're there to figure out what happened and destroy the ancient evils, blah blah skeletons vampires ghosts demons. The game is thankfully aware of how shallow this is and pokes fun at it quite a lot. Victor Vran doesn't take itself seriously - at all. Your constant companion is a snarky voice in your head that isn't ever afraid to deliver a low blow to your confidence - from the abovementioned hat mockery through pondering the meaning of mass murder for loot and experience to videogame references. The jokes are mostly rather memetic in substance and a lot of them fall flat but they're usually delivered fast enough to make at least some of them stick - my favorite is probably the Stanley Parable dungeon.   I don't think this game will ever become a beloved classic, but it's definitely a step above the typical point-and-kill ARPG in gameplay and gets a lot of points in my book for its admitted and embraced silliness. Definitely worth getting on a sale. ",

            "review_text": " Pros:  Perfec fighting system Beautiful graphics Superb dubbing Interesting setting Runs on Linux Well optimized   Cons:  Quite simple story Flat characters No point in (re)playing it after you've beaten it   Long version:  Really well made ARPG hack and slash game. It feels very similar to Van Helsing (only without robots). I was pretty much amazed by it for first cca 6 hours.  Many things are done just the way they should be in this kind of game. There is an intuitive and well-designed fighting system (I mention this first since it is an ARPG game), beautiful graphics, interesting setting and everything around it.   The ability to jump is interesting although it doesn't have much real use and it can sometimes be really annoying if you can't get where you want to get just because Victor desides to jump in some other direction. I would appreciate the opportunity to use it for surprise attacks, but that's not the case here.  The types of attacks you can make depend on your gear as do many other aspects (various types of mele and ranged attacks or the way you acquire Overdrive) so your build can be customized with great variety. I also greatly appreciate enemy UI, especially when they use special attacks - you can't escape those that easilly and when they hit you (and believe me, they will) you're gonna take a lot of damage.  Another fine thing is the challenge system - areas you enter offer bonuses if you manage to complete certain optional tasks.  The game has quite detailed environment that can, to certain extent, be intervened with. This, unfortunately, basically ends with breaking things, so you can't use the environment to support your attacks, for example. It would be really nice.  Music is nice and supports the fighting atmosphere of a demon-infested medieval city very well. Dubbing is especially good.  Last but not least, it is pretty well optimized. My machine is no snail but no rocket either and I only experience minor lags in a Hub area (so not much of an issue there).  So far so good. Now for the cons. The story is pretty simple and the way it's told isn't very interesting. Yes, it is an ARPG game and the A stands for Action. But RP stands for Role Playing and you need a story for that. There is just SO MUCH space for much deeper and better story. As it is, I could probably write an entire plot of this game in one line of this review. Game characters suffer greatly form this, because you can't have believable characters without a story. Since the NPCs are dubbed very well, it would be nice to have some elaborate story behind them.  Not just 'I got sick, a dark pact saved me and now my country went to hell as a price' or 'I'm a mysterious hunter and you're never gonna know anything about me whatsoever except for my name.'    The dodge ability is basically useless since almost all special attacks your enemies have will hit you anyway. Magical 'projectiles' like fireballs follow you no matter where you move or how much you dodge. In other cases enemies predict an exact spot you'll be in half a second later and launch a spell with the area of impact so big that you simply have no chance of dodging or jumping away. Even if you try it, they hit you hard. Special attacks of bosses bring this issue to extreme - for example they cast this pillar of fire that follows you and since it moves faster than you, you don't even have to bother trying to escape. It is good to have a competent enemy UI but this is simply too much. Just have at least 2 slots with healing potions ready at all times.  It was an interesting (and good) idea to add hunter's 'companion' in a form of a voice in the head, he does really good job (sarcastically commenting on everything you do) and is often very funny. However, as I wrote before, when I compare this to 'Van Helsing - Lady Katarina' pair, the latter clearly win for me.   Also, it feels really odd to still hear him after he's been defeated and he did a much better job in Stanley Parable, too.    But the main flaw this game has is an absolute zero value of replaying it. Not even the challenge system or hunting of 'wanted' epic beasts can save it in my opinion. I simply don't feel attracted by the idea of going through the trivial story and listening to the same jokes again. I tried that and it really wasn't fun. You can continue playing after you finish main story but I find that really dull - walking the same maps over and over again with nothing but 1 or 2 random epic beasts to be added.  To be clear I DO recommend this game just don't expect miracles. It will provide you with about 6 or so hours of fun and really good action. That said, consider if it's worth full price yourselves. I got it on full price and don't regret it, but had I known what I know now, I would have waited for a discount.   Summary:  Victor Vran is very well made ARPG game that certainly stands above avarage. None of the flaws it has is a game-killer and I didn't encounter any serious bug that would prevent me from playing or having fun. I also greatly appreciate that devs took the effort to support Linux systems and did a good job on that. I give it 8 / 10 (7 + 1 for Linux support)",

I was looking for a good ARPG at that time to replace Diablo 3 and Path of Exile, as I had played them till utter boredom. Several games, indie and professional alike, had disappointed me, however, Victor Vran did not. You play as Victor Vran, the titular demon hunter, on his quest to free the city of Zagoravia from a demon invasion. You don't need much more story in an ARPG, and the first versions of Early Access didn't even have that - the quest givers were basically the developers talking to you. The current version has the fill story, which is fine by ARPG standards, but nothing to write home about otherwise. You can play with gamepad or different keyboard/mouse configurations, I personally like the gamepad controls the best - they are fluent and support the action-oriented gameplay with dodging and a fully-rotatable camera. To kill stuff (which after all is the prime activity in any good ARPG), you can pick form a variety of melee and ranged weapons (swords, hammers, rapiers, shotguns, mortars and lightning guns at this time). Each weapon time has one basic and two special attacks, which males for interesting synergies in combination with magical properties (up to two per weapon). Character development does NOT work with a skill tree, but by choosing weapons, demon powers (spells you can cast once your overdrive meter is full; it fills by dealing damage) and Destiny Cards. The latter are items you put in slots that are awarded by leveling up and grant various buffs. The graphics are fine for on ARPG (don't expect photorealism) and a bit on the bright side palette-wise. The music sounds nice, I think it's a bit above the average ambient 'music' of many current RPGs. Is it fun? Hell yeah, it is! If you're looking for some fun, fast-paced monster-slaying, grab it. However, if you're looking for an 'MMO' ARPG in the line of Diablo 3 and PoE, with trading and ladders, check out some videos before, it might not be what you crave.",

First of all, graphics and voice acting are awesome, Victor's voice is just so right for his character, although 'Voice' get's a little annoying from time to time, he's pretty funny (like calling me a cheater when I jumped in the maze.)  Gameplay's pretty smooth, a nice breath of air to most RPG's where it's point, click, wait, repeat. The active combat, move cancleing and dodging are all very well done, slight gripe to be had on the dodge's I-frames (if it has any) but I put that down to me being used to Devil May Cry games. The ability to switch between two equipped weapons on the fly is awsome as well, although I wish we had the option to exchange that second slot for Dual Weilding (hint hint)  Now for a couple of personal gripes. All of which have to do with the Wraith type enemies encountered, most noticibly, the blue one. Either I'm stupid and am missing a huge cue they're about to do their rush or you need freaking future-sight to dodge those things. Secondly, a certain kind of challange is begining to grate on my nerves a bit; the 'slay X enemies without taking damage' challenge. By itself, it's a hard challenge of which I'd have no quaral if I didn't have to restart the entire area if I screw it up! I'm going to say this is also going to crop up in later dungeons with 'Slay X without using potions' or 'slay X without using Demon Powers'. I'm not dissing the challenges, gotta have them their for the extra fun and bragging rights, but why can't the counter just reset upon failing the condition rather then forcing a complete restart if you want to get it? It doesn't help the the first time you get this challenge, you're very quickly greeted by one of the afformentioned Blue Wraiths who wiped out any chance of that on my first dodge. The 'Slay without using potions or demon powers' in one of the later dungeons in zone 1 cut it close too, had to resort to some huge shotgun cheesing to complete the task without dying so I could use a potion.  I get the feeling these gripes of mine will dissappear as my skill at the game gets better, as said, played up until after killing the first boss of the game (who was a very fun fight by the way, only needed one statue although it got a bit dicey when he started summoning 3 totoms at once) and loved pretty much all of it bar those niggles, Looking forward to the DLC!",

            "review_text": "Despite the terrible name, the forgettable story, the bad dialogue and inconsistent voice overs, Victor Vran provides an incredibly active and fun fighting system and the ability to almost completely recreate your character on the fly, even mid-battle.  I turned the Voice track off about three hours into the game, so I had a few odd moments when the hackneyed gothsylvania storyline intruded on the otherwise excellent game play. This ammounted to a vendor disappearing until I'd completed a particular mission or enemies on a map spontaneously disappearing and then reappearing several seconds later. My point is, that you can mostly dodge the story, which is a blessing.  The mediocre voiceovers that I listened to were stereotypical old horror movie rejects and the two voices warring in Victor Vran's head, one deadly serious like Max Payne, and the other mocking and filled with odd, anarchronistic references. The two fall totally flat, in my opinion.  But the visuals are detailed and interesting, if a little too consistently on the darker side. Most of the animations look nice and some of the sounds, particularly the ambient track are quite nice. The weapon sound effects, however, are repetitive and tend toward thudding, percussive or tearing sounds that limit my interest in using weapons such as the shotgun and the rapier, at least with the volume up.  While we are unfortunately stuck playing as Victor Vran (or Vicki as the mocking voice insists on calling you... yes, it's THAT bad), there are several levels of customization available.  By eschewing character attributes or skill trees like you'd see in most ARPGs, your character's abilities are constructed from two weapons, an armor, several Destiny Cards, which add to current basic stats such as health or grant procs of many different flavors, and two Demonic Powers that act as nuke powers or big whammy spells.  By collecting, upgrading and strategic equipping, it is possible to come up with all sorts of ways to smash, slash, zap and explode Victor Vran's numerous, varied and fun baddies. Vran can be kitted out to just lay down Demonic Powers by selecting weapons, Destiny Cards and armor that all add to the Overdrive Meter (i.e. Mana). Or life-stealing and healing procs can be stacked with heal-on-hit weapons to make a tanky sort of vampire character. An obvious possibility is stacking the very many on-crit effects to create massive spikes. The possibilites go on....  The point is that, though you're always stuck looking like the same guy in one of six different okay looking costumes, you can make him wreak havoc in many different ways. More than just switching weapons on the fly, though, you can pause the game at any time and change out any or all of Vran's equipment; thus, totally respecing the character. The generous inventory space allows for a hoarder's delight of stuff to swap, should the mood strike.  The maps and environments are all hand-crafted, so the surprises they contain become less effective on repetition. While it would be tempting to expect a random map option, there is rather a lot of content that can be replayed under different rules by way of the game's Hex System. Hexes increase the difficulty, but grant bonus experience and extra loot drops. The game also contains 5 Basic Challenges and 5 Elite Challenges per map, which leads to all sorts of opportunities to revisit favorite fights and scenes and try to win under some pretty strict and arbitrary conditions (e.g. killing seven tough baddies with PBAOE bombs without using any potions and such).  Victor Vran serves up a fair variety of baddies, but often in mass quantities. This leads to some crazy, frenetic fights, which the game generally does well at. Some targeting issues, such as with the Hammer, seem to have been addressed. The developers have released a roadmap of mostly free content, and they continue to balance and patch the game.  I cannot stress how important the feel of the combat is in this game. It allows for several, meaningful strategic choices by way of the different attack effects of your two weapons, a multitude of Destiny Cards, several Demon Powers to choose from and a variety of triggered events, choke points and unexpected enemy ability combinations, because, seriously, if you don't like the fighting and the looting then there's little to recommend Victor Vran than some good, if murky looking, graphics and dialogue so awful that you'll be embarassed to be listening to it.  If you like Diablo 3, Torchlight or any other ARPG lootfest, then Victor Vran offers a slightly different approach that yields much the same fun of smashing the next big bad guy and grabbing fresh phat loot, along with great fireworks and some steampunk style.",

In addition I like the combat system. Every weapon-type has its unique skills (basically 3 of each) and so its own tactics. Timing your attacks right and rotate depending on the situation is very nice. 'The voice' brings alot of fun in Victor Vran, when playing through the story, which is underlined with neat artworks and speech. Challenging bossfights and a huge amount of different enemies with unique abilities and adjustable difficulty-options (called curses) are additional reasons, why the game won't become boring.

Die whenever you want, no penalties.

You have several options of engagement right off the bat and your options only get more numerous, with a dodge as a basic ability, rather than as a skill to actually implement skillful play beyond placement and building your character, and no conventional mana meter. There's no traditional stat placement, most of it governed by gear, such as Cards, giving passive bonuses as long as they are equipped, and your choice of clothing at the start of the game, reminding me of Monster Hunter in a sense. The game is surprisingly good looking for a small, rather unheard of release, too. The voice acting is also fairly high quality in comparison to some other unknown releases.  My biggest gripe is the fact it's a literal ♥♥♥♥ing meme game. Gangnam style skeletons, the voice in your head making Stanley Parable references, the same voice also saying Keep Calm and Carry On, Christ this is a cringefest and I've only just got past the first boss at the time of writing this.",

I'm not sure why it has gotten so many favorable reviews, because it doesn't deserve them.  Game controls (at least for PC) are absolutely horrible. Three attacks are allowed and two of those are special and on long timers. Thirty percent of the time, the game animation over-rides the ability to use the special attacks.   Bait and switch during boss battles (i..e., running around and letting a boss beat on you while some special power sucks the life outta you) is absolutely painful, even on casual. Its almost as if the game is negatively encouraging you to replay completed levels over and over in order to get the weapons and cards necessary to defeat a boss.   Add in the fact that the weapons are basically uninteresting variations on three items - hammer, sword, shotgun, and it's basically a frustration-fest. The demonic powers your supposed to obtain with the Overcharge ability are absolutely laughable...you push and push to get the overcharge event going and are rewarded with an unimpressive spurt of power. To make matters more frustrating, Overcharge trickles away about 5 times faster than it takes to build up, ensuring that you surely wont use it often.  I'll give the designers credit for the ambience and graphics, theyre pretty good, but gameplay totally ruins any kudos they might have gotten for that.  Merchants are also horrible - I have yet to see any affordable weapons for sale that are useful at all (at least through level 10 when I finally said enough, and stopped playing). Potions, what there are of them through level 10, are on timers, and are a complete waste of the gamer's coinage. You can easily find potions just as good as you play though a level.  The game looks good, i'll give them that...but the gameplay is absolutely boring and uninspired and didn't draw me in to continue playing it. Even having Geralt of Rivia's voice as the protagonist didn't persuade me to play a moment longer.  Basically 4/10 - would not purchase again.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game due to my absolutel LOVE of ARPG's, even bad ones like the Van helsing series. I play ARPG's more than any genre, Torchlight series, Diablo series, Van helsing sereies, Grim Dawn, Path of Exile, etc. etc. This game had tons of great reviews, had new interesting game mechanics, so I gave it a shot.  First off, there is no real skill progressoin of any sort. Every ARPG i've ever played has a real solid RPG aspect, where you can really create your character how you want to. In Victor Vran, you equip a weapon, and the weapon gives you skills. You can equip 'demon abilties' which are just charge up skills. Finally you get cards, these cards have some base passive stats for your character to give a minor customizable aspect to your character, but its very bland and doesnt feel like it changes anything. I can get past all of this for the most part, this im fine with.  What breaks the game is the controls. There three options for controls, and yet all feel clunky. When it comes to ARPG's, tight controls make a game, and clunky controls break them. This had weird hit boxes where I would be clicking on an enemy, yet I would be walking to them rather then attacking them. Also the fact that multiple of the skills are on keys (W, E, etc.) but don't automatically attack when pressed. So therefor you need to Shift + key to attack. It's minor but it makes no sense. Im well aware shift is used in many ARPG's if not all of them. But when Im surrounded by 30 spiders, and want to using my PBAOE skill, i cant just click it, and have it go off.   Secondly the map will randomly rotate your view and will be south after exiting a point. Im all for map control and camera rotation if its needed. The weird hit detection on things made it so I couldn't walk to area's and needed the camera rotation just to walk to the area i needed to go. So it's needed in this game, but it's needed because of bad mechanics. Map/camera rotation is something ARPG's simply dont need if the camera is implemented well, and can only sometimes confuse the player, there is no benefit to having it.   It's all these minor things like this that coupled with weird hit box detection that makes the combat feel bad and unsatifying. I really wanted to give this a chance for the simple fact that it was trying new things to broaden the ARPG horizons. It just wasn't implemented well, and thus I must give this a 'No' recommendation.",

The beginning of the game is your tutorial while once you get to the Hub, you pick a class for your character, Victor Vran. There are 3 class types for him. It comes down to your play style. There's 3 difficulties you can pick, 2 of which you can survive if you are careful. The third is if you want a challenge, but I've yet to even try that. I might finish this game and then pick hardcore.   In a nutshell. Diablo 3 clone with camera control. 1 character, Victor Vran. 3 class types. Abilities based on weapons. Demon powers can change.

What made me love these types of games was Grim Dawn, a superb game and I cay say the same to Victor Vran.  +This game has an epic main character, Victor ofc. You'll surely start to love the character throughout the game. +You can do many character builds. +Game world is really nice, has alot of hidden secrets/areas to explores. Well made dungeons aswell. +Really fun boss fights and monsters overall. What makes these fights even more fun are the 'Hex' system, makes the game experience waaaay better, and more challenging. +There are some cool unique weapons, for example the Chicken cannon, my god...amazing. +Fun and easy-to-understand crafting sysem. +Codex most definitely also. So you could see all the recipes for crafting, monster types, bosses etc... +Enjoyable soundtrack. +If you just wanna go on a killing spree, you can fight in The Bottomless Pit, which is fun addition to the game. +Free content by the devs and more to come.  There are some negative sides however they aren't a major ones. -I wish there was more types of weapons. Most of the time I have only used a Tome and a Rapier. -No layered armor system. Grim Dawn is a beatiful example of that. Combining different armor pieces and upgrading them. Victor Vran only offers so called 'outfits', which have certain bonuses, which aren't even that good tbh. I guess I can forgive that, since they look cool. -That one son of a unbalanced b*tch boss in the Secret Pumpin level. Holy jesus, that boss is unbalanced and overpowered. No matter what build you have or what level you are, you are unable to kill him. Playing on casual mode won't even affect him. I still haven't managed to kill him, I've tried even killing him WITH A 3 MAN TEAM AND STILL DIED. -Leveling system. Now the level up rewards are good, I like it. However when you hit level 50, you'll stop leveling technically. You go like level 50 (1), 50 (2) etc.. Every level up containing the same rewards, a gift box, which never gives anything good :(  Overall a enjoyable game. Definitely would recommend playing!",
