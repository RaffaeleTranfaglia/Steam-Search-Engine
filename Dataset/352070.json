The gameplay is fantastic, to the point that I had to finish it before going to bed. This was a ton of fun and I'm going to share it with everybody who thinks you can't make a good clean game interesting and fun to play. If you like tower defense or Angry Birds, definitely try Fort Meow!",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed playing through this game. If I wasn't going for the achievements (which I did end up having to do a second play-through to get) my playtime would have been much shorter. If you're looking to throw away a couple hours on a fun game, I would definitely say that this game is worth the money.   Essentially, you are a girl who has come to spend some time with your grandparents. Upon your arrival, you find that neither your grandfather, nor your grandmother are around. Searching for something to do until they arrive, you find your grandfather's journal and become enthralled with his detailed account of what he's been working on lately. However, there is one minor flaw with reading the journal...your grandparents have some VERY needy cats who crave your attention. To keep them at bay, you must build a fort and read the information that they may not want you to know...  While this review might show a conlist that outweighs the pros, the game itself is fun and the cosmetic issues are things that can be overlooked in the longrun. I would give this game a rating of 9/10, as it is a unique idea and was generally fun to play through.  Pros: - This game is entertaining. The storyline itself was interesting and the side quests were entertaining. I was not bored the entire time I played through Fort Meow. - The game continually builds upon itself. You are tasked with collecting side items to strengthen your fort, as well as clues to chip away at the mystery of these overly affectionate felines. - Both the music and the art style add to the gameplay. The music isn't grating upon one's ears and it's lovely to look at. - The random drops from the packages were a nice touch, giving the player a chance to hoard the items and use them when a level was too hard to conquer without the use of something else. - The creators were thoughtful enough to include Steam achievements and trading cards.  Cons: - You cannot skip scenes. I do not like being forced to read the entire dialogue. For 1 playing, this might have been an irritating quirk. However, only having the ability to click quickly to speed along the dialogue would not be nearly as useful as a skip button for entire scenes. - It's short. You can knock this game out entirely in one sitting. Some people might like this, but it would be nice to give this game some more replayable content, like the last level. - The only challenging part of the game was the last level, where you must rebuild your fort multiple times while the battery is recharging. While the later levels do try to increase the challenge of cats, I felt that the outcome was entirely luck based. You had to have a little more strategy in how you built your fort to keep its stability. - It's a bit repetitive and is almost entirely luck-based. I've found that by using the same shoddy builds up to 10 times, you will eventually get a success. - There was a lack of introductions of the new cat introductions. I felt as if I was having various new cats thrown at me constantly and noticed that the description of the cats in my journal did not always pop up upon their introductions. Sometimes I would have to wait until after the level had finished to read about them. Having a notice popup upon each cat's arrival might have been more useful. - The inability to return to the certain areas in the last level(s). Do not head past the Dark Room or you will have to replay the entire game to get the achievements.",

            "review_text": "Really cute physics/puzzle game, but quite short (although personally I don't find that to be a drawback). You're tasked with making a fort out of furniture to protect yourself from a horde of pouncing cats for long enough to read a diary which hopefully explains why all those cats are there in the first place. The game features several types of cats that do different types/amounts of damage and the player is encouraged to look around the house to find more items to use to defend against the cats. There are items that trap, repel or attract the cats, reduce the damage they make, etc. The game does not have any challenge modes or an option to replay levels, so in that respect its replay value is limited (although the dev has hinted that an endless mode or something similar will be added to the game). But it offers a fun and relaxing way to spend a few hours. I played it in the company of a friend and we had a lot of fun stacking up furniture and watching cats throw themselves at it.",

Seems like if you have a codec pack (I have ffdshow) and/or dual monitors, the audio in cutscenes can lag. There are also a few crashes, but the levels are so fast and the game saves so often, you don't mind them  Overall, it's amusing. The graphics are cute and the characters are quite loveable",

Losing a round won't make you mad, because there's a cat in your lap who purrs. Then you just try again.",

            "review_text": "- 'Just the Basics' achievement is semi-bugged; took like 20 attempts with a reinstall somewhere inbetween to finally trigger - bug where two different musical tracks play simultaneously (on top of each other) - bug where items can no longer be rotated (requires exiting to menu to 'fix') - bug where perfectly horizontal items are sliding away on their own due to collision physics wonkiness - bunch of other minor bugs, like the shadows of both Nia and Magnus always shown when viewing the machine, even when Nia is alone (after winning the game)  All of the above are rather common occurences. What I took the most issue with, however, was how the story developed. It promotes a pointless genocide of cats who would rather just be left alone to dream of electric mice, all for the amusement of asinine children. The grandfather's approach to them (that can be gleaned from the journal) is also highly controversial to me - how he treats them as disposable objects, not noticing a point past which they no longer were such. And back to the kids again - it's all fun and smiles for them while the (clearly at least semi-sentient) cats are fighting desperately for survival. The callousness of the whole thing left me disturbed and saddened, from a casual game I would've never suspected of influencing me in such a way.  Compare this to Hatred, which is one of my favourite games of 2015. In Hatred, humans are the target. This makes it okay because, frankly, the human species has it coming. Cats however, are off limits (to me at least).  The music is nice (I like elevator music). The art direction is passable, though how they do faces (both of cats and humans) is just... ugh. The gameplay itself is quite fun but none of this is enough to salvage my opinion. Not recommended.",
