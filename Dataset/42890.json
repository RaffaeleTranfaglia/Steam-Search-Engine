            "review_text": "I'd probably call this game a cult classic, but I don't even think the following it has would extend that far. Which is a shame, considering how epic this game is. Honestly I can say if you want a 4X space strategy game, get this, and ignore the sequel.  Why? You might ask, surely the sequel is better! Wrong, it had a terrible, terrible launch, released in a bad unfinished state, to the point where even clicking the new game button would crash it. Which isn't the developers fault, i'd like to add, they suffered the same problem that plague's most games today, the publisher forced them to push it out the door.   But back to the original topic. SotS is addictive and more importantly, fun. Six races to choose from, each with their own quirks and style of play. You can set up a galaxy with a number of options, ranging from amount of stars, to the galaxy shape, the size of the stars themselves, the distance between them... basicaly you can create any game you like and choose who you want to play and play against.  It has a randomised research tree, every game. So don't get comfortable with those awesome beam weapons, come the next game, you might be unlucky and not get that tech. There are some essential techs that every race gets, every game, like the very basic laser or mass driver tree. But each race has different probabilities of getting access to the much more advanced technologies that are in the various trees.  The empire management is... basic, you colonise planets and they develop on their own, terraforming till they are suitable for your race, and building infrastructure. Some planets are so hostile that you can't even colonise them, although there are technologies that you might get access to that can improve the hazard they impose.   Ship design is another interesting and fun part of the experience, as you pick different sections and weapons to put on your ships. Maybe you'd like a ship fully loaded with missles? Sure, go ahead, just be mindful that if the AI has a lot of point defense, that ship will be nearly pointless. So a lot of designing can revolve around what gets thrown against you, or what you come up against.  Then, theres the random encounters... which is an option you can fiddle with in the game settings when you make the galaxy. Basically, it is what it says on the tin, a random encounter can range from a asteroid shower, which can wipe out a new colony, to getting attacked by slavers. But there are special types of encounters, which often turn out to be dangerous and can take massive fleets to stop. I'll give you an example of a grand menace I encountered in a game I played, The Peacekeeper. This dude comes into the map and travels to the center of the galaxy and makes a speech, telling you to stop all hostilities with each other and stop prodcution of war ships. Break these rules while he's on the map, and he attacks you. Sounds reasonable, right? Wrong, this guy is... holy mother of god frightening, he will literally tear your fleets to shreds, no matter what tech you have. Luckily, he doesn't discriminate and will love wailing on the AI as much as you if they step out of line.  All in all, Sword of the Stars is an impressive, and addictive game, that is starting to show it's age graphically, but the fun factor and replayability keeps me coming back to it. I deffinitely reccommend this title to any 4X fans, and especially to space strategy fans. It's an easy to pick up game, thats difficult to master.",

            "review_text": "Basically Rome Total War in space. Only less buggy and you don't have to worry about ♥♥♥♥ing squalor(Diplomacy is still lacking, but who has time for that while commiting genocide on bird/fish/dog/ant/whateverthe♥♥♥♥tarkansare people?).  Combat plays kind of like Star Wars: Empire At War, only MUCH more in depth. You can pin point exactly where you want your ships to fire and with what weapons. Every weapon has it's own use and even your basic destroyer class ships still have their uses end game.  The research tree is race specific and semi-random, so although you do have a few technologies you can count on being there, don't always expect to get that Anti-Matter Missile Upgrade. However you can still salvage technology from enemy ships, so not all is lost. The tree itself is vast and makes you feel like you're playing pokemon(GOTTA LEARN THEM ALL!) for scientists. Unfortunately, finding out how something is effective requires either a google search or trial and error.  I play on a Dual Pentium 2.3 ghz laptop with an integrated graphics card(♥♥♥♥ you Intel), and yet so far I have yet to hit a spot where framerate becomes an issue. However once an AI controls a large territory they take longer to figure what they do(so I assume) and so you get a 30 sec to 1 min delay in turns. Which is extremely frustrating when you are just trying to skip turns.  I've played with the AI on normal difficulty and default economic settings and so far I've been able to take on empires twice my size(probably due to me beefing up my economy then research end game tech a little early and I did finish around 400-500 turns so not the quickest by any means). The time limit can be a curse when you are trying to comb the area for enemy units or simply trying to glass a planet.  Great game, definitely something for those of you who want to conquer the galaxy, plenty of race variety and scenarios to make you replay this game.",

            "review_text": "Although my record says 7 hrs, I owned the game way before it went steam and got around 400+ hrs gameplay sink in this endavour.   This is by far the most unique 4X gaming experience for me and I consider it as the most immersive. I absolutely dig the SoTS lore that is in fact extremely deep and enjoyable to dive into. The graphics, although not so flashy as in newer products, suits the game very well and those dialogue lines! Still give me shivers while playing as the mythical Morrigi or the insatiable Hivers :) You get a lot of replayability since each race has different mechanics and randomised tech trees for each playthrough while some random effects (i.e. von Neumann attacks) can tip the balance of power even lategame, especially on higher difficulty levels. Speaking of difficulty levels - at higher settings the AI is very, very good and will keep you on your toes uneasy about your borderworlds safety.   The most memorable moment for me would be the construction of my first projector dreadnought with extreme effort and seeing it and it's escorts shred to bits in the second battle to a swarm Zuul fleet. Yeah, the learning curve is quite steep and makes it a real challenge to master.  Unfortunately, the second part is not as fun and I could not make myself to like it. As some people stated below - SoTS I mechanics with SoTS II engine would be really great to see in my library.  As far as cons go I would say that automanage functions and diplomacy could work better.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a deeply immersive, complex and unique 4X experience in an obscure and mythical setting. I played a lot of strategy games since 1997 and I have to say that as far as the gaming experience goes, the only other 4X games that have similar feel to it are Illwinter's Dominions series and Amplitude's Endless Legend.  This is a very rare gem. The game is still very enjoyable for me to play in 2016 - 9/10.",

While it may not be as pretty or as polished as Galactic Civilizations, its mechanics are solid and the game is fun. The tech tree is interesting and provides a few innovations, like the idea that your civ might miss out on certain techs and have to work with what you have. Combat is very interesting, as it involves some real-time giving of orders (such as targeting spcific parts of enemy ships). For the most part, though, it follows the same basic model as Gal. Civ.  The downside of this game is that the interface can be kind of clumsy, it is fairly hard to learn, it lacks a Story Mode, and it just generally could use a bit more UI and graphics polish.",

They murdered my people and made my cities into nests for their queens. I would lose every battle with only takng out a few of their ships. I sent a colony ship into deepspace in hopes that they would find a planet while we were eradicated. BUT just as i had given up hope, My research team finished reseraching Dreadnuaght class ships. I, in a last ditch effort built one and sent it to my former colony to clense the bug scum festering there. The battle was long but in the end i was able to destroy their local fleet, their hive and one of the queens. The Dreadnaught and all crew were lost however. This was my first victory against the vermin. I began mass producing dreadnuaghts and sending them to purge the bug filth. One by one i reconquered my colonies, which major cassualties on my side. and eventually the last hive was destroyed. There was still some kind of super queen still out there however, I onky ran into her once and after the last hive was destroyed i had not seen her so i assumed she was gone for good.   I Began rebuilding my empire and put this whole thing behind me. Couple hours later i check up on my Colony ship, yes the same one, and noticed that they found a nice planet to settle. I settled a colony and a few hours later my ally requested help with defending a planet. i send some ships and what do i find? a Giant Bug Super Queen wrecking my allie's fleet.

The universe of Sword of the Stars is such a mad, varied place that all kinds of space opera scenarios wind up playing out over the course of a game. Any given game you stand a solid chance of triggering ancient space traps, fending off enslaving space marsupials or watching in horror as your robot workers become sentient and begins a crusade across the galaxy. And those are some of the more likely scenarios. There are stranger, and more difficult things that might occur over the course of a game that can change the usual free-for-all to a set of uneasy alliances engaged in a bitter struggle to survive a common, devastating threat.  The game itself plays out as a turn-based strategy game on a 3D starmap. Battles are either autoresolved or played as real-time skirmishes, with decisions and research made on the turn-based map impacting the capabilities of the ships in the battle. Ship design is a major gameplay element, and works quite well for the most part. Research into command and control technologies will add more elements to the real-time battles like sensor coverage, reinforcement ordering and larger fleets.   The different species in Sword of the Stars have major differences in gameplay, which leads to oft-amusing and unique scenarios in every game. Every side has its own method of movement, desired planet type and research priorities, giving what could have been a straightforward conquer-or-be-conquered game a bit more depth and intrigue. There is surprisingly fleshed-out lore, and the actual faction species are creative and varied. There are hyper-destructive space possums, Latin-speaking, fast expanding space humans, telekinetic space whales with a penchant for genocidal bioweapons and intensely slow, tough, monarchic space insects among the playable factions.  There are plenty of issues: the interface is complex and unintuitive, the amount of randomness to the game can be frustrating, and the voice acting straddles the line between charmingly bad and ear-grating. Most of the unit portraits and loading screen art is amateurish at best, and the base game isn't the prettiest thing to come out. There is a solid core of inventive ideas and decent gameplay though, and the game lends itself well to replayability. The multiplayer worked quite well, but the internet multiplayer was done through Gamespy, so games have to be set up through a virtual LAN like Hamatchi right now. It's worth playing if you enjoy stuff like galactic civlizations and distant worlds.  ",

The different races all have unique play styles, with different methods of FTL travel rather than just having one race be better at farming. The economics are pretty simple by the standards of the genre, but they aren't the focus of the game. The combat is a lot of fun. Shots are actually modeled, rather than being determined by a to-hit roll, and battles are determined as much by good strategic movement and arcs of fire as by technology.  Sword of the Stars tried a lot of new things, and they really worked.

Its ok but I wont be going back to play this one for a while, checking out Star Ruler now to see how that plays.",
