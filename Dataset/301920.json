The main story will probably take you 6 to 10 hours to beat. The Side Story took me around 60 hours to beat but i kind of suck at strategy, so you time may vary and probably 5-10 hours of side battles that are 95% optional. The game is worth the money in my opinion.    P.S. i also recommend you buy this game in its the soundtrack bundle",

            "review_text": "There's so much I could say about this game, but I'll try to keep it short.  The gameplay is fairly straightforward. If you've played the first game, you know what you're getting yourself into; if not, it's still pretty easy to pick up. Grid / tile based strategic movement, Battleship-like firing, fog of war, time-based unit recharge rather than turn-based. Though I will say, once you get into the Great Cavern... they really step things up. Gonna take some mad strats to survive down there.  Fairly extensive customization (and even more tanks!), though later in the game you'll encounter some checks to stop you from getting too overpowered and just nuking everything.  The story is... well, it's actually pretty incredible. Well, okay, the main story is fairly standard stuff. But the NG+ side story, the Great Cavern, is amazing. Gets into the origins and motivations of the Human Tanks and is far more moving than I ever expected. Aaaand there's at least 6 or 7 times as many missions in there as in the main story.  Art is the simple, sometimes blobby stuff you can see in the previews. But again, it actually manages to get better as you progress through the Cavern. You can find some pretty impressive, and unnerving, visuals as you go along.  Soundtrack is as eclectic as ever. I don't know if there even is a genre for the sorta stuff you'll hear. Very fitting sound design though.  Ah, as a last note, you don't have to have played the first game to enjoy this. It just fills in a few details, and leads to some neat inferences as to the lore, if you happen to know when the game is calling back to the first one's characters.  ....and Heshiko Mk III is an absolute beast.",

            "review_text": "Truthully speaking, I was looking forward to this game after the great impression the first one left with me. But I can honestly say that I am not having fun with this. The gameplay lays out the same way as it's predessecor, except this time there are a few new tanks, which is always nice. The story isn't really relevant, let's be honest with ourselves, these games have no story.   The biggest flaw with this installment is the cavern system. The cavern is a very long series of challenges that make up pretty much most of this game, as you progress, the battles become very hard very quickly. I found myself being unable to clear floor 9, either because my troops died or I ran out of time.   The problem is grinding, in the end. You need to grind to get resources, which you use to buy better tanks to make battles easier on yourself. But the thing is that the best tanks, or even the slightly better tanks are very expensive, and the free battles that are actually possible for me hand out a ♥♥♥♥ poor amount of resources.   Most of your finances will come from the cavern, and I am stuck in a loop hole where I end up 'not being able to progress through the cavern because I don't have good enough tanks, but I can't get better tanks because I don't have the money, and I can only really get money from the cavern, but I can't progress through the cavern...' and so on and so forth.  So, I can't reccomend this game, it doesn't hold the same spark the first did, with the resource management and obtainment being clunkier than before. And the story really faltered and made me feel as if everything I achieved before hand meant nothing. I give it a 6/10, and can only hope that the next one isn't so mildly dissapointing.",
