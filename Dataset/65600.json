It uses all the assets of the original to do something new - in this case to continue the story after Gothic 3 ended. To me it shows all the characteristics of user made content. All, except the love for the original game. The world feels empty, the hero is an arrogant b***h (though somewhat understandably given the story) and you are limited by basically nothing. I am not sure if I should rate it down or stay neutral....",

            "review_text": "I guess this was supposed to be an expansion to Gothic 3, but it fails in so many aspects.  To start, all the ♥♥♥♥ that happens in the normal game doesn't count here. The game world is just a chunk of the standard Gothic 3 map; It's not small, but it's still kind of disappointing, especially considering how Gothic 2 and other open-world RPGs have handled expansions.   The combat is fairer than in normal Gothic 3, as blocking actually works for the enemies. The visuals are more efficient, but this is to be expected, seeing as how the size of the game world has been drastically reduced. I would have figured that this would also lend more depth to the actual gameplay and variety, but most of the unique NPCs are now just replaced with generic stand-ins who give fewer quests but otherwise perform the same functions.   There are also so many things that simply don't have a reason to exist. For example, in Gothic 2, it's possible to escape from the map into the void, but it does require some going out of the way. In Gothic 3: Forsaken Gods, all I have to do is jump around the little boulder blocking the path to Nordmar. My question is, 'Why bother including Nordmar on the map if I'm not even supposed to go there?' I can see the location when I bring up the map on my interface, but it has no reason to be present in the game.   My biggest gripes are in the general sloppy execution of the whole thing, resulting in problems not even too plentiful in vanilla Gothic 3. Models are poorly placed, the AI doesn't know how to follow, many NPCs have multiple voices, the crime system is gutted to the point that I can steal entire towns without consequence, and I could go on and on. Some of the bad changes can sometimes be helpful, such as how I can use transformation potions to morph into animals in front of hostile guards and just walk past them, but doing the same in front of allies is asking for suicide.   But none of that matters, because all that it really took to kill it for me was the broken quests. When a main story quest irreparably ♥♥♥♥s up without explanation, that just ruins everything. This is an expansion only in the loosest sense of the word. It might as well just be mod, and a rushed one at that.",
