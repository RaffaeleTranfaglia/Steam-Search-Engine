            "review_text": "I don't want this review to be too long as you need to play the game to understand what I'm saying!  The Albino Hunter is one, if not THE best game of the year if we're talking about games that hide under the radar... (personally :3)  I haven't played an old school RPG for a long time so I thought why not? I was recommended the game by my friend as it was cheap, and one of the groups encouraged the purchase, so shoutout to them people - you know who you are!  The game hits you with hilarious humour that is present through the beginning to the end. Some people might find it cringy or weird, yet I thought it was perfect as you don't see many games that use humour as a major thing as it's risky - althought you have games such as Deadpool and this that pulled it off greatly. There are inside jokes that reflect upon the developer and her past work which was pretty interesting. The reference to the actual player and the meta aspect was very different and it felt like a breather from the actual game. The characters are very interesting with each and single one differing from one another in order to pick your favourites and to simply not be bored with the same kind of dialogue. Quests are major in RPG's and the ones that are presented in this game are unique, interesting and again - funny. There are areas that differ from another that also have their unique enemies that provide a good fight, along with a decent amount of gold and exp. The new skills that are unlocked are VERY classic such as boosting the ATK of the party, provoking an enemy to hit a specific character, hitting enemies all at once yet with a reduced amount of damage and etc. This is the most basic description of the gameplay, in a nutshell :)  I feel like if someone wants to capture the essence of this game, they need to try to immerse themselves to the fullest by blocking out the real world with a set of headphones and a comfortable seat as you'll be playing this game for a while - as exploration is key to finding cool items but also the achievements that people are desperate to get! This game is really a gem not only for the gameplay. Although this is a small indie title, the Dev's respond to every single question that the community ask regarding the game. The timing is near to instant and the first comment will ALWAYS be from the dev - attempting to sort out the problem whilst being kind at the same time.  By no means is this game perfect. There are many bugs and problems with this game as it's completely new - but it's slowly developing. The devs release updates that sort out most of the problems and when a new one occurs, they fix it in a flash. It's Â£0.15 (dunno how many centssss :S), you're not loosing anything and if you don't like it then oh well, maybe your friend will! But yeah I hope everybody gives this game a shot as it's worth it in my opinion. I've only played around 6 hours and I feel like I'm no where near done!",

            "review_text": "This game might be worth playing if there were some type of instructions to tell you how to get full screen. It also lists as partial controller support, but good luck finding out how to make that work.  I was lucky enough to have someone in the forum tell me how to engage full screen, but I don't think I will play this game using just the keyboard.  So, until there is some type of game manual, or maybe a word from the the devs on how they expect us to play, (or not play) I can't recommend this one.  PS. If you don't agree with MY opinion in MY review of this game that's fine, just don't spam it with trolling because I''l just delete your comments anyway.   Thanks.   EDIT: After voicing my concerns about the options and such the developer has released an update adding an options option in the main menu.   In the options menu you can choose full screen and I have tried using an xbox controller and it does work perfectly.  Based on these things alone, (especially the quick response from the developer) I feel I really need to change my recommendation.  I also have to admit, now that I've been playing a short time with the controller the game is rather pleasent and the attention to detail, (in game) is commendable. ",

            "review_text": "English:  I was really unsure if this game was good.  Good i did buy it on Sale!  I love RPG Maker games and also was into it and know it since about 2003. Also knowing that the Community exists where you can get RPG Maker games 4 Free is sth i always liked. Now that you can buy them on Steam is good i think (you can now support the Developers with it!!)  As i know that RPG Maker can be messy and i know how much work it is to do Quests/Chars etc (since i did try a demo and made a small demo games for test purpose) Seeing a game like this so bugless is good and also seeing that almost everything was handmade is also awesome (like ATB etc) But there where a few Crashes from the Runtime Script (suddenly) still the game never told me that itself had issues nd crashed! I also noticed that my AMD FX didnt like the gme and i had from time to time sudden FPS slow downs due to core using but since those games are Single Cored i didnt wondered cuz i have 8 of cores lol (windows seems to be unable to tell which cores where unused or sth like that) so my game lagged about each 30 seconds for about 5 seconds due to it.  The Story is so far so good. Its also very Comedy like game! I did laugh a few times about what they speak and some Events where just serious as i be when i play GGZ on Android xD    Here is now a small list how i would give points for the game in each categorie:  Gameplay: 8/10 (Simple yet you have the skills learned on some highter levels)  Graphics: 5/10 (a simple Pixel Art, i love Retro style cuz im into those RPG Maker games!)  Support: 8/10 (fast responce from the Developer Chery-Sama when i posted up my problem!)  Price: 7/10 (not to expensive and also on sale very cheap!)  Story: 8/10 (good Story Plot. sometimes Awkward and funny and so on, but it dont misses to entertain i think)  Sound: 7/10 (not the usually 16 bit sounds, those are handmade tracks i think)  Performance: 8/10 (serveral Issues due to Core using of my FX, but that wasnt the games problem its my windows/cpu that could not get the game properly on stable 60 FPS when walking in the Free Roam)  FAZIT: 7/10 (A good RPG Maker game, worth a Try if you like comedy and VN and oldschool RPG)",

            "review_text": "The way I see it, JRPGs should be judged on three things: Story, gameplay and functionality.   Story, which would would include characters, dialogue, plot, etc, is pretty average. The characters are great, and can be funny, but the plot is nonexistant. Granted, I haven't finished the game, so I'm not really holding that against it too much in my judgement... but it still bothers me I'm five hours in and the plot of the game is 'do sidequests!' If that's the plot, that's fine... but I still don't like it.  Gameplay, is also extremely average. It's your basic JRPG battle system, but not interesting at all. This cheap, rpgmaker niche that has appeared on Steam has shown it can have interesting battles... just look at a game like Cubicle Quest. In that game, you basically must figure out what the foes weakness is, and rearange your party to combat it. But in this, the all your party members basically fit into two categories: those who spam basic attacks, and those who spam their strongest spell. Weaknesses and resistances don't really fit in much, since they only affect the latter group, and even then, if you have a tier two level spell that is resisted by the foe, it will do more than a tier one level spell that has an elemental advantage. Plus, the inclusion of MP is useless in this game. Your MP pool is so big, and you level up so fast, you never run out of it, so there's no point. Oh, theres also this half-a$$ (did I mention that instead of swearing the game just puts symbols in? Because they do that, and it makes me think their target audience was nine year olds) active time battle system which seems like its probably a public script you can find on the rpgmaker forums. It's useless, too, since your characters are going to move in a certain order anyway. All it does is add breaks in the gameplay. But I can excuse this, because I love myself an average jrpg, sort of turn based battle system.  But functionality just flops. I inlcude graphics and audio in this... and they both suck. Basic rpgmaker graphics, which, while not gamebreaking, do stop me from saying 'Daaaaaaang this place looks nice' or 'holy crap this battle theme sounds great.' But I can excuse this. What I can't excuse are the glitches. There are quite a few, and while most are pointed out by the 'Glitch Fairy', and you're shown how to avoid them, there's one that is consistent and not pointed out: the fact that, for some unknown, god-forsaken reason, certain battles will crash your game. You will lose all your unsaved progress. But it's okay, right, because they just tell you to save every three seconds, and promise to fix it in the remake on the new version of RPGmaker. (spoiler: it's not okay.)  Theres also the price. 5 dollars. That's absurd. This game is worth 2.50 at best. So I don't recomend this, unless its on sale for half off or more. But that's fine. Because when it goes on sale, they usually put it on super sale (I got it for less than a quarter of a dollar).",
