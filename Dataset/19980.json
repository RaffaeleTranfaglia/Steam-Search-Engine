            "review_text": "Having already beaten this game in 2008, I remember loving everything about it, the graphics, the voice acting, the gameplay... everything was perfect. So the idea was to instal and play a relaxing game while I wait for Arkham Knight to get released.  Well, the 2008 me was kinda wrong... the combat in this game is just awful and cringe inducing, I have no idea what they were thinking when they made it so that you're blocking 70% of the time, with maybe 15% of free fighting, and 15% quick time events/button mashing. Maybe they were trying to make it harder artificially when they realized the game was too short and fun and easy, I don't know... but I wish the game had 0 combat and more environmental puzzles to fill in the blanks. Luckily though, there are not a ton of fights in the game, so they don't completely destroy the mood.  The controls could be a bit tighter, but they aren't horrible, they work... I mean it's a Ubisoft parkour game, you can't expect anything more out of it really.  The story is next to non-existent and that's OK. You're looking for a donkey, but instead you find a princess, now help her save the world... c'mon man, do it! She may not be a donkey, but she's hawt.  The game came out in 2008, and it looks absolutely amazing even by today's standards, with maybe some stiff animations and facial expressions that wouldn't be present if it were released today.  All in all, if you love and miss Playstation 2 era platformers, this game just might tickle your nut$@k. - 7.5/10",

But after a while you'll just end up wondering 'why the hell am I still playing this?'.  You really quickly end up doing the very same things over and over and over AND OVER, to the point where it all feels like one big chore.  The 'jumping arround' is fun but if you take a good look at it, it's rather limited. You end up running through the same patterns during the whole damn game. You fight each of the few bosses several times with litterally no differances in your approach (fights are just QTEs btw). The puzzles do nothing but slow down the pace for a short bit but won't require you to think much. The game allows you to interact with magical plates at some point, which allows you to get to new areas, but they don't bring any kind of diversity to the gameplay and are pretty flappin' anoying (especially the yellow ones)  The game is litterally just a succsession of QTEs, with a complete absence of challenge. The fact that you can't die, even during combats, thanks you your qt magical gf, removes any kind of threatning situation. All that's keeping you away from the end of the game is just the fact that you have to collect shiny stuffs that are all arround the place. It's entertaining at first but it's really all there is to do, and it's not satisfying.  This game stands as a reminder of why QTEs are dumb ♥♥♥♥ and why having a 'fail state' is vital to any game of this kind. Too bad.",

You climb the same exact areas, the same exact level designs, collecting shiny orbs, with an occasional 'boss' battle. It is an insultingly lazy game. Ubisoft did not care one bit about the game itself, the orb collecting and area opening aspect of the game, which is the biggest part by far, is the most boring thing ever in a game. The prince's and Elika's relationship is by far the best aspect of the game, but honestly the game is not worth playing for that reason alone. The only positve thing I can say about the game is the cellshaded graphics, and the general art direction. Other than that, just pass this one, it's not worth the money. 4/10",

It's a fairly expansive (read: long) and they really did a good job on translating the old 2D PoP mechanics into 3D and then built levels that took advantage of them. I had a blast playing this game, aside from a few spots in a few levels and limited combat sequences, it was fun without being frustrating. The game progress is fairly linear without being obvious about it, since the game basically uses a huge interconnected world that you're free to explore whenever you want, though progress forward on branches can be blocked at various points by tools and abilities that you haven't uncovered yet. Once you uncover the tool or ability you can return and progress further, and sometimes there's multiple branches it unlocks so you don't always have to continue down a single branch.  It's a shame Ubisoft basically went nowhere with PoP after this title, instead rehashed the mechanics and engine of the earlier 3D titles with their subsequent game, including the tedious fixation on combat.  Note that I played through this title on my own a couple years ago in a non-Steam form, hence my short amount of Steam gameplay that doesn't cover a full playthrough.",

Really, you couldn't get someone besides Nolan North to do the Prince's voice? It's such a unique and highly used voice now that it kind of pulled me out of the game.  I think the most frustrating part of it all is this game really feels like it had a lot of potential. The artwork and graphics are quite pretty (except during the weird glitches). The music was quite lovely even though there wasn't much of it. It was a Ubisoft game without Uplay. Jumping around was even quite fun albeit a little repetative. I wish I could say more positive things about the game but even my compliments sound like complaints.

I mean the game is REALLY PRETTY and I love the overrall designs, both the world and the chars. HOWEVER, despite how awesome some of the new platformer mechanics are, NO ONE should be forced to go through the same paths over and over and over AD ETERNUM!   So the game keeps a good job on entertaining but more often than it should, it makes you realize that you are wasting your time by forcing you to do some boring as hell task, aka collect orbs. Already expecting something like this to happen I collected as many orbs as I could without straying from my path throughtout the game, and it seems that wasn't enough. Sure I got my first power without a problem, but what about the second? For that one I had to collect orbs, since I barely had half of the required ammount! Screw this!   This sort of playtime extending technique is something rarely forgiven, and not always despised in two situations:   a) They are made interesting and hilarious (Saints Row 2 POOP AVENGER XD)  b) The game is for some reason compelling, on either Story or Mechanics.   POP fails in both and at the same time unjustly compromises it's strong point: World Design. Would you pay to see the tip of the Mount Everest once? Probably yes. What about a second time? Perhaps if it was good. And what about another 20 times? HECK NO.   POP combat mechanics are ridiculous.  POP exploration mechanics are ok, but the whole no risk I'll just grab you back up thing kills the mood.  POP story is overral bad or at least lacking the urge to know more.   POP is an ok game, but it doesn't live to the Sands of Time Trilogy. Now those were AMAZING!   P.S. Btw, the dlc is storywise important, and it's only available on the consoles -_-",

It's like...the first sections of the game are done and the rest is ...well.. done very poorely to say the least.

They WERE very well written until I finished 1/2 of the game. After that I was thing countless times 'why did you say that? That had no contextual input whatsover.'

The environments are beautifully cell shaded and look amazing at high settings. The story is pretty good, with the chatter between the main characters being the highlight. Collecting orbs to unlock levels can be annoying, but gives a reason to check out the levels in both their corrupt and cleaned states.

I thought it's mostly for a younger audience, it looks so console-ish. But when you play, it's all fine, and fights are fun, especially since you can't exactly 'die'. Lots of cool movements and tricks you can pull with the enemies. Just as you're getting tired of jumping and performing acrophobic acrobatics, there comes a fight for a change. A few dialogs afterwards ease the tension. A few last boss fights are rather exhausting, as they are full of quick time events, and you must remember which symbol corresponds to which button to press. But when you master it, it can be fun, but maybe too enduring. Unfortunately, the game doesn't quite end, because of a DLC that was never released for PC, only for consoles. But if gaming for you is a recreational activity, I can recommend this one. It won't wear you down as much as it will entertain. It is pretty long, took me 35 hours to finish it.

You are playing as a thief, badly written, pseudo-funny thief, who got lost in a sandstorm and runs in to a girl , magical girl, who is a princes of totally made up kingdom with absolutely overdone looking architecture which looks like paintings that have all been draw with one move making spirals and more spirals every time... and because you are a bad thief, you decide to help her. So You must save the kingdom from the darkness by finding the four bosses, defeating them over and over with no significant change of environment throughout the whole game.   Do You like collectables? When you have to collect thousands pieces of something just to gain reward, then guess what. You can't finish this game without collecting all the thousand pieces of something, because You need them to unlock a way to get to the bosses. But there is nothing else to do either because there is absolutely minimum of story. And only distraction while running through the plain wasteland of the game map are the conversation between prince and the magical girl, so poorly written that You'll stop paying attention to them after 5 seconds. In comparison with previous instalments of the Prince the running, jumping, climbing trees is much better in this one. It has been made faster and bit more vivid, but the fact that environment does not change throughout the whole game makes that totally pointless. The time powers are gone, replaced by spiderman wall running, and even when we knew that not every prince of Persia must control time it seems kind of silly that every time you fall the magical girl pulls you back up from the midair like nothing. Battle system is even more boring, allowing you fight only one enemy at the time with no acrobatic kill moves making it only more painfull.    Do Yourself a favour, don't buy it.

Overall, the story is good and unfolds nicely. The ending is good too, but may leave you wanting more. In fact, there is more... an Epilogue DLC that didn't make it to PC (thanks Ubisoft). You can play it on console or watch it on YouTube. I wish I could say the Epilogue ending is better than PC, but it's not. In any case, this game is well worth your time.

Starting with the story, this is one of the best written games of last generation, and its simple to play. While the combat system might be dumbed down for previous PoP titles, there is still a plethera of comboas to try and land with this games combat system. Toss in the spectacular character development and interaction between Elika and the Prince, and the beautifully rendered environments. This game is sure to please.",

Yes you can not die but this helps to cut away loading time whenever you fail (if you even do) long platforming sequences.  Yes the combat is only one on one (one of two) but the ammount of combos you can do it very well in depth and some of the later enemies require you to use paticular attacks before you can use other moves.  Sadly because of a lot of negitivity when this game came out the story ends and will never get a proper conclusion it deserves.",
