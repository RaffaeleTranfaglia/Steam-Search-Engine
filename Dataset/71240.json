            "review_text": "This game really caught my attention. A fishing game that no others can match on the comparison scale.   The gameplay offered by SEGA Bass fishing has serious buoyancy, and you will not mind sinking hours into it. I had one hull of a great time learning all the mechanics inside it. I really wish there were morray like it.   The amount of time I lost just getting so in-depth with this game was a bit crappie, but maybe my time control is just a fluke; and there really is no need to be steamed about that. And I just failed to keep my head above water.  I recommend you try this game, don't leave it up to salmon else. This game will seriously have you hooked.",

            "review_text": "A wonderful fishing game that really brings you back to the Dreamcast system. The controls are the only obstacle of this game. The gameplay is awesome because you can catch a fish every-time casting out. It has a single player campaign that lets you catch alot of fish for the Tournament standings. There are really big fish and little ones to be caught but all will be a challenge if you dont know how to handle the reel right. The graphics are great for this type of game. It puts you in control of everything and lets you see into the water to catch the fish you want. The music in game is old school and fun. The overall game is great and if your into fishing this is a must buy when seeing it on sale. Ive loved playing it in my spare time and I know you will too.",
