Controlling one goat with each side of a controller is very difficult, but in a good way. This game is frustrating, hilarious, and fun! My only issue with it is that the music is a bit repetitive, but that's easily fixed with a mute button. Do yourself a favor and play with a 360 controller. So what are you waiting for? Grab a controller and rip your hair out! It's fun! -PR0XIDIAN",

As other reviews have already stated, it's a small test in frustration, in a lesser 'Super Meat Boy' kind of way. The game is very fair in how it plays, and there is nothing wrong with the controls, however when you control two characters (Goats!) at once you realize your brain is not agreeing with your fingers.  It's a cute game with achievements, trading cards, it tests your hand/eye coordination, it's cheap to purchase and tells a story of life, loss, redemption, greed, gluttony and grass.  *Please note that many, many, many goats were hurt in the making of this review. I regret nothing about this, nor my purchase and would recommend this to anyone on the fence twelve times out of ten. Happy hunting.",

I picked it up expecting to plow through it in about a half hour (based on  howlongtobeat.com)  and it took me just over three hours. Most of the time I had a blast, though there were definitely some hair pulling moments. Thanks for a great game guys!",

            "review_text": "Far from being 'just another goat game', Goats On A Bridge is a wonderfully innovative platformer with adorable graphics, though a less-than-stellar storyline. You take control of two goats, Tempo and Chubbs, who must rescue their brother, Tiny, from the evil troll who kidnapped him by crossing ten bridges all the way to the troll's castle. Along the way the two brothers must jump over and slide under obstacles while the bridge falls apart behind them.  This game is certainly a challenge in single player, where you control both goats at the same time. I found that using a controller was best, as each goat is controlled by an analogue stick, while bumpers are jump and triggers are slide. You don't have to move both goats at the exact same time, you can switch your focus between them as long as you're sure not to let the bridge fall out beneath the goat you're ignoring.  There are only 10 levels at the moment, but the devs have promised FREE DLC that will add at least 10 more levels to the game, and hopefully a better (or continued) story. As it is, I still recommend it, even at full price!",

            "review_text": "If you like pulling out your hair, I highly reccomend this game.  Difficult to play especially when the How to Play page gives me controls that are different than what they actually are (I died eight times trying to jump over an obstacle. The button they told me to use was suppose to be the jump button but instead it was the duck button). I figured it out eventually but god I was so mad!  You're controlling 2 different goats at one time and you can not pass a level without getting both goats over the bridge. Very mind boggling if you try to move both at the same time! (Especially with a game controller!!)  I also think that the times to get 3 stars or even 2 stars is almost impossible especially when you aren't use to controlling 2 characters at one time. You're going to need a loooooot of practice before even thinking of getting 3 stars. If you're a pro at multitasking, you might get 2 stars. Maybe.  Overall, this game is very challenging but that's not a negative. That's actually a pretty good thing because you'll never get bored. You may rage a bit and probably quit but this game is pretty fun when there's so much to do. I might come back to this game to rage again but for now, I'm going to save the few hairs I have on my head...!",

You can impale yourself on vertical spikes by running into their sides and the hitbox seems to take up the entire tile it sits on. 2: Camera angles. You'll find yourself unable to see parts of the path where you're standing even after some attempts to adjust the angle. 3: Your brain. With the water background and very light shadows it's very hard to tell where in 3D space some of the tiles are. Sometimes you'll think a tile is below you in front but it's actually to your right.",
