There are a couple of glitches that almost ruined my playthrough that made me redo most of the storyline quests just so i can continue playing on my save file.  The game is rather short and i feel like this game could really use keyboard controls for movement. The keyboard shorcuts are also very odd ... i feel like it would have been better if the shorcuts were placed right next to one another with one of the keys set on 'J' key to make it easier .  love the game still but i cannot recomment it at this state :(.  i feel sorry for the tutorial dummy cause it has to endure being fought by high level characters . twice",

Good soundtrack, good writings, Turn-Based/Combat mechanics is fun (despite a little random about tactics cards you will get), story a bit clich√® but definitely entertaining. Maybe full price is a bit too much, but bought with 40% and definitely I don't repent I bought it :)",
