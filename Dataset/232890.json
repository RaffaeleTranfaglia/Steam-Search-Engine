            "review_text": "5/10  I wont lie, I was a little dissapionted with this game when I first stared playing, I was a big fan of its predecessor 'Stonghold crusader', this was by far one of my favorite games when I was younger. Pros and cons:  PROS- The graphics in-game have been updated, although not as much as you might hope for, especially for the fact that the old one came out 12 years ago. - It is much harder to appease the peasants who flock to your castle, this does make the game a bit more challenging when it comes down to 'laying siege' to an enemies castle, at least in multiplayer. You can starve your enemy in a manner of speaking.  - There are new units, athough most of these are nearly identical to the predecessors, using some of the same quotes and one-liners. - The walls fall down in 3D, instead of dissapearing,  - Destruction of castle walls and towers, looks better, CONS- the Opening menu was a major dissapointment, i dont really know what i expected but the predecessors kicked ♥♥♥ compared to this new one. - The new AI sucks, really sucks, (eg. the enemy computer always gets free siege equipment)  - The graphics aren't that imppressive for the amount of processing power it takes to run the game. - The price tag for what you get is practically extortion.  - If you arent familiar with the game it is quite hard to understand the mechanics of the game, depsite the introduction campaign/scenario - The new voice acting for the AI is just generally annoying, in my personal opinion they should have used the old voices from the last game. - The mulitiplayer menu, is the same as the opening menu, a dissapointment - There is a building and troop limit, whilst understandably for lower end computers is unchangeable, but there should be a way to adjust it.  All in all the game leaves you feeling a little underwhelmed, to be honest if your thinking of buying this game do yourself a favour and wait until a sale, save yourself the dissapointment of spending a lot of money on something that isn't quite up to standard.  I do know that Firefly are releasing updates and extensions so hopefully in the future they may be able to fix some of the problems, and annoyances.  ",

            "review_text": "Stronghold Crusader 2 offers very little change from the previous Crusader (2001). Hardcore fans and achievement hunters will be the only ones who will appreciate SC2. The 'Campaign' trails are back from the original. They offer no more than a series of AI skirmish challenges that vary in difficulty. There's a dozen or so tutorial missions the have some kind of 'Narrative' but I use that word loosely.  Melee Fighting: Winning consists of massing a blob of units into another player's castle to kill thier avatar 'Lord.' I say 'blob' because the units clip into each other It's not pleasing on the eyes when a group of a hundred pikemen can't be distinguished between a single guy. To make matters worse, during a fight they all clip into smaller blob. To make matters EVEN worse, a well placed pitch pot can decimate a group of hundreds.  Castle Smashing: The castle walls are no more than ten feet high and seem as strong as paper mache't. A few catapults can blast through a wall very quickly. Probably why they removed ladder men and seige towers from the previous games. They added 'ragdoll' physics, when a unit is arrowed they will tumble off the wall, if their foot doesn't get stuck and trap them hanging like maniquins for a few seconds before they disappear. When a tower falls with units on top the ragdoll levitates like Wil-e- Coyote holding up a sign before they fall to the ground.  Themes: The music is the only thing done right. Really great Crusade feeling soundtrack. As for the two religions, a lot of care was taken to avoid controversy. The Islamic Saracens dont eat the 'pig' food ration (they grow sheep farms instead) and don't drink Ale, another handicap seeing as how they can't gain the happines benifits from Bars, and no other feature was put in place instead. Churches and Mosques are only distuinguishable from a little moon and star above the Mosque.   TL:DR= Only for fans of Stronghold. a lot of features done poorly, none really dont right. It's old Stronghold with new spit polish. Nab it on a sale and knock out the generous achievements.",

            "review_text": "The Stronghold series has always been extremely difficult to summarise, but I guess the unfortunate word that I tend to use is 'frustrating'. It hasn't ever recaptured that momentum that Stronghold Crusader delivered back in 2002, producing games that didn't deliver for a variety of different reasons.  Unfortunately, I don't think newcomers to the game will enjoy the game as much as we do. It still has a lot of content missing, and areas such as the menu's and HUD are definitely missing a much-needed improvement. The graphics aren't as good as you'd expect, and the AI is broken at times. Troops refuse to obey your commands due to bugs, and so on. It certainly wasn't what I was expecting, thats for sure.   With this said, I do rate Stronghold Crusader 2, and I do enjoy playing it. It has been great for a player like myself who grew up playing the original. Just to have the feel of Stronghold again, to get a taste of what originally made it so successful. Character dialogue is witty, the gameplay is fast, and the numerous scenario's that you partake in provide excellent replayability. The tutorial and majority of skirmishes are brilliant, even for me a few of them I kinda thought '..how the hell am I supposed to do that?!' but you eventually get into the groove of how the game dynamics work. Its good to progressively see yourself get better &amp; better, as you challenge yourself further by adding multiple AI and restricting yourself to using certain units/buildings. I haven't completed the campaign as of yet, but so far its been extremely good fun.  So for fans of previous Stronghold titles, I am sure you will learn to appreciate the game for the quality it has, though somewhat trapped inside a conglomerate of faults. For newcomers I am skeptical as to how much you'd enjoy it, as there are other titles in this genre that do much more then what Stronghold Crusader 2 provides. Still, SC2 provides some memorable moments and entertaining game scenario's, yet lacks the full package we truly want to see that follows in the originals footsteps.",

It's not that great as the original Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader was, but for me it delivers fun.  Pros: +Sieges are really fun, especially against AIs (they don't send 40crossbowman and archers on one tower) +Troops are balanced, you can do well with both Arabian soldiers and European ones +Wolf, Saladin and Richard are really well made and fun to play against. +You don't have to train engineers in orded to make siege equipment, which was really boring in original SC (you can simply buy siege equipment in siege camp, which is more convenient) +Devs are still trying to patch the game despite it's low popularity +Some good old music from original SC +Co-op mode kind of thing  Cons: -Bad looking buildings (most of them are just boxes and also farms, exept the hops farms are ugly as heck) -Badly animated AIs messages -Badly voiced AIs (i'm talking about Polish version here) -DLCs... although they contain really well made AIs i wouldn't spend 5$ for each of them. -You can't sustain on the battlefield with little, low populated castle, you pretty much can not go below 50 peasants, unless you are playing against Rat.  Overall, this game is much better than people draw it to be... but if you are not into Stronghold series, i don't think you will be happy with this game (lack of story in campaign sadly and mutiplayer is not the best option for a newb)",

To the game: The 'campagin' has sadly no real story and it is just skirmish maps. To be fair, crusader 1 was the same. The unit balancing is well made and this game needs more strategy thinking because of the special of the units. It is not just possible to spam one or two unit types to win. I played over 270h now and still like it and it makes fun to play it in multiplayer.",

Should I Invest in Iron? should I have Arabic Troops or English? where will my walls be best defended? and what resources do my allies have? The Campaign Is interesting But real strategy lies in skirmish mode. Strategy I have not seen in a lot of games these days. A avid fan of stronghold 1 and crusader I have spent countless hours into those games. I feel the same strategy applies here. Not to mention castle raids feel epic. tower collapse and enemies fall from them. Its everything I wanted from a stronghold remake. If your a fan of medieval warfare I greatly recommend. stacking is a bit weird and AI is not perfect but It feels like a stronghold game should. not like 2 and 3 and that weird one where there was magic and monsters???  Stronghold crusader 2 is a must for anyone looking to strategically defend and build a functioning castle in the heart of the crusades.",

            "review_text": "Stronghold Crusader 2 is yet another attempt by Firefly Studios to capture the success of the old cult hits Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader. Yes, yet another - there have been three other installations that tried exactly that and failed hard. But as the old saying goes, third time's the charm... err, fourth time's the charm. Or, after the third time, a desert setting's the charm?  Not really.  The appeal of the original Stronghold and its standalone addon, Stronghold Crusader, was pretty clear. Unlike other RTS games at the time, it was very focused on style and believability, building a nice looking castle, seeing its populace bustle about as they produced goods. The block size for a wall was about 1x1m which was great for making highly individual castles.  Sadly the devs don't seem to understand that, and to my understanding, they've been trying to make the Stronghold games more like other RTS, at the expense of the small details that I loved the original games for.  Stronghold Crusader 2 is no exception for that. The block size for walls chunky, which doesn't exactly allow for sophisticated castle building. Towers don't seem to fit in very well. Many aspects were 'gamified', defensive siege weapons for example work without a crew and are moving magically. Siege camps are built inside your castle instead of in front of the enemy, and immediately churn out catapults like in something like AoE. Also, many production chains were simplified.  Immersion took a second or third place to so-called 'playability', perhaps to make it faster, more appealing to RTS fans.  Except those still won't touch this game with a 10 foot pole. The way units are produced, buildings are built, repairs are done instantly, the lack of fog of war and many of the other shortcomings just don't make for very good RTS gameplay.  For the rest of us, the whole immersion aspect went down the drain.  Personally, there is something else that quite annoys me about this game. Thing is, Stronghold Crusader was a standalone extension to Stronghold, which meant that a lot of aspects were simply copied over. For example, most buildings still had the same cost in wood, even though they're made of stone, which also makes more sense to use in a desert environment. Also, Arabian units felt very 'tacked on', as they cost money instead of requiring weapons and armor. And even though the whole setting screams for two factions, all players had the same available buildings and units, with only the lord looking different.  Stronghold Crusader 2 not being an addon to anything else, I'd have expected it to fix these issues. But it didn't.  Furthermore, this game is a technical mess. There is no borderless windowed mode, no anti-aliasing. SSAO produces ugly scan lines all over the screen. Performance tanks once a game picks up some action. The AI is garbage, your allies will constantly demand goods from you from the first second. There are bugs all over the place, some that I noticed when it released 2 years ago. And with all that, it still has the graphics of an ancient game. Look at Company of Heroes and this, and tell me that one came out 8 years before the other.  Last but not least, I'd like to give a honorable mention to the completely horrendous art in the game's menus. The average 15 year old on DeviantArt could draw something better.",

Online play is ok minus the above.  -Very shallow in terms of strategy, buildings and units.

            "review_text": "This game is slightly disappointing to say the least.   The first game, while lacking in good graphics had a LOT more options for castle building, and management.    For Example, you could choose what kind of ruler to be. Feared, or Loved. Choosing Feared meant having torture instruments placed around your castle, and having higher taxes. This would reflect on your peasants' attitudes toward you, making them less happy but more hardworking.  Choosing to have a more peaceful castle meant lowering taxes and having the option to places statues or flower gardens in your castle to make your peasants happier, but work less hard. Regardless this added a lot more immersion and made you really feel like a Ruler, instead of just the castle's contractor placing walls and buildings.   While the graphics ARE indeed a large improvement, there seems to be a serious lack of unit types in this game.   Sure it has slaves, assassins, horses, archers and different types of swordsmen, but not much else other than the addition of the Sergeants, and conscripts (Crusaders) and the Whirling Dervishes (Arabic). I remember a time when we could make siege engineers at a Siege Guild building and have them man a variety of useful siege equipment, (Siege Towers, Ladders, Tower Defenses, etc)  It is easy to tell this game was rushed, and doesn't offer much except for shiny new graphics and the same old 'Can't place that there m'lord' voice in the sky. Please please please devs, give us more to manage/produce next time you plan on releasing a game. What we have now is terribly bland, and basically the same as the last game. (With the exceptions I've listed above.   The other thing that really bugs me too is the lack of inventiveness on the devs part with the AI enemies. They have the same washed up foes we fought in the first game, and maybe a few more (that cost real money to have by the way). I think this is very unfair, and more should have been done before the initia release to introduce these new enemies beforehand so that we wouldn't have to cough up our precious cash to BUY them. I wish I hadn't. (P.S. Whoever animates your enemies when they talk to you makes me laugh every time at how bad they are)   The map editor is very simple to use and create wonderful maps, however. But like I said before, there is not a lot to work with, and sometimes even mods can't fix that. If anyone reads this, I would really like to say I do recommend this game, however it doesn't offer much in the way of troop management and castle building, other than placing a few buildings, collecting resources, and making weapons/ale/candles/etc.   I am sorry if you disagree with me, but it is how I feel on how this game turned out.   On the plus side, I once watched a tornado rip through an entire force of enemy troops which totally saved my life by the way. Had a rough start.  #RIPTornadoBro",

While loading it up, I was prepared for the worst (based on the mediocre Stronghold 2 and disastrous Stronghold 3 release) but after playing for a few minutes I was surprised at how much I was enjoying it.   Crusader II fully flushes out what they were trying to do with the Stronghold 3 economy. Every building in the game is expensive yet does its job well, meaning you'll constantly be weighing different strategies. Limited oasis space makes these decisions even more difficult yet rewarding. Is it better to tie up valuable space with hops farms to create ale, or make candles safely within your castle but then spend the resources on the much more expensive church? Of course, you have to defend yourself from constant attack while making these decisions.  The greatest improvement in this game over the original is the difficulty. While not being at all welcoming to newcomers of the series, veterans should be pleased at how much time you (usually) have to invest in every match before claiming victory. The AI attacks early and often, and truly grows stronger as the game progresses (much stronger). They know how to defend themselves as well. Compared to the original, you will need a much larger army to kill your opponent with a single siege.   This review is already longer than I intended but I have to touch on the combat balance as well. It is exceptionally well done. Every unit has a clear purpose and fills that role well while ignoring all other tasks. Archers, for example, are excellent against non-armoured units but next to useless against swordsmen (especially if they are escorted by a sergeant) and even conscripted peasants with pitchforks kill them easily with melee. I could come up with an example for every unit type but that would be redundant. Suffice it to say, the combat feels excellent.  With more enemy lords and campaigns being added down the road, this is definitely the game I have been waiting 12 years for.",

This is suppose to be fast paced and you have to be quick to build up your castle and army I cant even begin. When i click to place any buildings i have to click the building 3 to 4 times before its highlighted and then i drag it to where i would like to place and i have to click it again 3 to 4 times to place the building and theres times where it doesnt place at all. This makes it impossible to move fast, i go the pace of a snail which makes the game unplayable. I thought it could be my computer as it only has a Nvidia GeForce 9300m GS 512MB graphics card but that cant be the case as i dont have any problems with the actual game play. I thought i would wait a few months to see if they have any patchs released and i havent seen any to fix this issue. I cant even write this review on what the game is like (tho from the few minutes i managed to play its nothing like the old crusader) as I have played every stronghold game before this with Stronghold Crusader being my favorite but this is a huge let down. I dont understand why change something that works and has a huge following, is the graphics in the old one great or amazing no, but it makes sense and was alot more appealing and user friendly then this 3-D crap which has been in all strongholds since stronghold 2 and i just find it to be a killer for the franchise which is so sad as it was one of my favorite computer games.",

If you are looking for an in depth city/castle builder, unless you've played all the Anno, Age Of Empires, and earlier stronghold games until you simply cannot stand to play them any longer, then this MIGHT be worth the buy if it is on sale.  I bought this game whilst it was on sale, undetered by the overwhelmingly negative reviews i had read earlier, I foolishly bought the game with the low expectation that it would be at most a poorly re-done stronghold 3. Even with those low expectations I was still let down. The campaign takes well over an hour of unskippable grinding gamplay that inst even remotely interesting before you even get to do anything remotely interesting. To make matters worse, there was no mention or easily recognisable option that would speed up the game speed, and so it was almost when i was at the end of my patience when i discovered that the only way to change game speed is with the hotkeys '+ or -', making this game a hell of a drag for the beginning of any single player match  The multiplayer is barely any better, it shows none of the fast paced action of stronghold 2 or its predecessors, and the matchmaking was very poor and scarce.  In summary, unless you have played every other strategy game you own until you cannont bear to play them for one moment longer, do not buy this game. I would instead recommend watching the opening cinematics for AOE1 in 240x 180p than recommend somebody actually buy this game and play it",

Hated the territory system from the other games, extraordinarily disappointed in myself for not realizing it would be in this game. Disappointed in the devs for implementing it here as well. 4.

Many useful buildings (such as the much needed popularity buildings, and the replacement of the different religious buildings with a one-size-fits-all church or mosque) and beloved characters, including the dastardly pig, snake, etc. have been removed in exchange for a handful of what in my opinion are much worse characters. The economy has lost much depth from one game to the next, many systems (such as leather or hunting) have been trashed in favor of unifying the materials needed to recruit troops (ex: crossbowmen now use plate armor rather than leather). Not to mention that units such as the horseback archer, engineer, laddermen, miners, and monks have all been discarded, removing an entire aspect of seige warfare from the game.  This being said, however, there have been a few good additions to the game, namely more in-depth castle defense (meaning a handful of new defense buildings), even though the developers got rid of moats. Those of you who have played Stronghold 3 will be glad to know that hoardings and barricades have survived into Crusader II, along with seige engine towers. The (formerly much-needed) healer unit can now be recruited at the mercenary post. I'm sure I missed many other changes, but those were the biggest changes that I could recall.

I made the mistake of trusting the game but not even an hour in game told me that I definitely wasted my 50$ that I could have spent ALOT better elsewhere. Get this at a lower price if you want it, ignore peaceful mode unless you just want to stare into nothingness due the games now basing a lot on the RTS side and not its castle sim side which made peaceful mode at least slightly entertaining. But now the game unless a patch improves this IS NOT considered in my opinion a castle building simulator due to its lack of castle life that used to exist that made the other games more unique and different. the entire franchise except the past 2 have been going quite well, unfortunately this games not getting the taste of stronghold I hoped for, but I do hope they add it back in the future because that’s one of the things that made stronghold a different RTS game.",

First up, i do nor own the dlc's yet soon as i get them i will get to do a review on them aswell  Pro's and Con's: ______________________________________________________________ +The grafics arent as bad as everyone is claiming them to be, they are solid.[and Grafics are not really important for the amount of fun you can have with a game!!!]  ______________________________________________________________+The AI is punishing especially on very low resources makes for some great game[the AI cheats but it does nowa days in everygame!) ______________________________________________________________+Map versatility there are a good amount of different maps to play with and it can be interessting fightin an all out last stand against 7 AI's ______________________________________________________________+Gameplay is far better than in other Stronghold's, battle is more intense more often and you can have a 500 strong man corps wich is very large! ______________________________________________________________+Music is just great, i don't get why people say it is not epic??? most of it is from the Original Crusader ______________________________________________________________+Multiplayer with AI( very important for me since i hate playing with random douches..) ______________________________________________________________+The UI is simple and easy to use/get used to, wich is great for newcomers ______________________________________________________________+It is actually dedicated to the Former Crusader fans therefore it is not a new supremecommander,Starcraft 2 or any other RTS it actually stays true to the FANBASE[ the universe can't comprehend this many Pro's i am giving for this fact!). ______________________________________________________________-The AI is using more and more little ambushing troops instead of massing units and siege you allout, wich makes it some times bothersome to play specific AI. ______________________________________________________________-Map's are not Large enough(for me that is) and there for no one needs horses ?!(and horses are lackluster). ______________________________________________________________-Ballista does not one shot units ????? i think it should no man or Woman can survive a 2 meterslong bolt throug their body?. ______________________________________________________________-Unit stacking on Towers(really really unencouraging people to build big nice looking castles and get people on the walls... ______________________________________________________________For me this is what i love and Hate bout the game, the AI is far Superior to Crusader, but only for the aggressive part dfeensive they are really not doing anything except using traps,(differs from AI to AI) the weak AI enemys are not utiilisyng anything that could let them survive a serious besiege'ing wich is.. sad. They are also not using the full potential of there Castels there are rarely any units on the walls.. ______________________________________________________________So why do you need to buy this game? ______________________________________________________________Well the Anwser is easy, really; It is a Great GAME that gives you alot of time to play around there is even a Map Editor wich you can play hours with it before actually creating you're own map and SHARE it on Steam Workshop, if you have friends you can have some tight battles against the ai if you combine different strength lvls on AI it is getting even more interesting. ______________________________________________________________ BTW: i did not encounter any bugs, they have been tended to, and been fixed. Please ignore those reviews who are just writting something on 1 Dislike basis and one stupid bug... games where never perfect and they just get more complex so they never will be perfect! ______________________________________________________________ i can Reccomend the vanilla game for full price, you won't regret it if you love building you're own castle and then battle it all out!",

They got a lot wrong here in an effort to make it a game more based on war rather then economy, and the end result is unfortunately not all that fun. let me explain why.  The devs said over and over while the game was in development that they were trying to recreate the fast paced skirmish mode feel you got when you played the origional stronghold crusader. While this is a good intention, the end result pretty much adds up to the enemy sending countless waves of small suicide squadrons to your castle CONSTANTLY, never bothering to create larger seige forces as a reaction to your castle growing larger. It is flat out tedious. At the end of a skirmish match when it says you killed literally around 3,000 enemy archers, you just want to smack yourself in the face.  They also majorly streamlined the popularity and economic systems from previous games, so now keeping your people happy is as simple as making sure they have food. Making money boils down to making ridiculously high numbers of breweries and candle shops so your peasants are happy enough that you can raise your taxes. So your castle will always be the biggest candle factory and beer company in the Holy Land. Thats very realistic.  Apart from that, they also decided to take out the funny little things your peasants said when you click on them, which is kinda sad, and they descided to release more AI opponents two by two in DLCs, after only giving you an insulting eight opponents at launch, while the origional Crusader gave you eleven at launch. and for this high price? its a rip off.

The bottom line is that this game is still sound, and most of the bugs in the game have been patched at least to my general view. Sure, some of the mechanics and things could be better, but hey, all games have their flaws.   One thing I did want to bring to attention is that this game is still kind of buggy. Things don't seem to line up super well and the actual units themselves can get kind of glitchy. Other than that though, the game still provides me with lots of fun. I bought this game on sale for 10$, and can say that it is worth at least that much. But 50$? No thanks. Get the game on sale. I would wait for another sale like this weekends, or maybe up to half off at the most. But don't pay full price. This is nowhere near as good as something like The Witcher 3, which was worth every penny.  Hope this review is at least somewhat helpful. It's still a great game and addition to the series, and they did redeem themselves quite a bit after the disaster that was stronghold 3. So I personally would ignore all the negative reviews, as most of them complain about problems that existed in the original games, but of course they didn't have a way to comment for those ones. Any solid member of the Stronhold Series would still enjoy this game, especially for 10 bucks.",

It seems it sacrificed too much for nice UI and the lack of need to build stockpiles all over your castle like in crusader. Some buildings are simply too expensive like houses and especially mill. But what I dislike the most and wanted fixed since the time of first stronghold is the very limited space on which you can build your castle. In crusader 2 it is even smaller than in crusader and you cant really get creative in building one. You will have most of your buildings for food or wood exposed outside of the castle walls which makes it very hard to protect them. I guess it gives some sort of reality into the game but this is one thing where I dont think it is needed. Also the lack of restart game option is a bummer for me. Miss that a lot too. On the other hand the AI of enemies is good and the kings are unique which is nice + a lot of missions to kill some time. Definitely not worth the full price but for 3,5 Euros in current sale it is not bad. I would give it 7/10.",

Stronghold crusders 2 was advertized in such a way to show a rich story [Or at least I, myself found that after the great fights] However that little video you find in the trailer cannot be found anywhere inside the actual game.  I don't believe i even saw a castle that resembles something in the trailer inside the game.  The campaign was remarkably short and could be completed within one or two days if you're experienced at all [Which most of us are] so the campaign is really not worth even looking at.  The multiplayer aspect seemed quite nice 'Hey, you get to build a castle with another person? Great!' If only you could not duplicate resources whilst doing so. Woopdie do.  Do you guys remember the stronghold 2 multiplayer? All the small fighting guilds that shot up to battle eachother whilst having fun?  That does not exist here, It's more like the time around a year after the release of the game, one or two hosts actually waiting to play someone.  I'll spell it out for you however: [Remember this is an educated estimate] Only around fifty people own the game.  Now, I'm sure a large amount of people actually bought this, But the multiplayer is so empty that either they got chased off by the campaign and demanded a refund or they took one look at the multiplayer and said 'I'm not waiting ten to twenty minuites just to play a game'  The characters in the game, You know the rat and the other guys? It just seems too easy. The animations of the characters are also quite flawed, a little like they used a really old animation software. [It can easily be improved]  The voices and sounds seemed as if they were copied over from a previous game, it would have been nice to have thoughs get changed up.  Did you know messing around with archers get thier old voice, and then suddenly if you are lucky the voice suddenly changes? Quite interesting, I actually found out myself about ten minuites ago.  I'm surprised you actually read this. I didn't put too much time into it as it didn't seem a worthwhile cause.  All I can say is don't buy it. It's a waste of money unless you like playing verses computers and the odd player.",

            "review_text": "Fan of the series? Buy it. Fan of RTS games? Buy it.  Welcome M’lord to a review of Stronghold Crusader 2.  After waiting 12 long years since the first Crusader game, Firefly Studios have released the much anticipated sequel; Stronghold Crusader 2. Whilst the later instalments of the franchise have not lived up to the critical acclaim of the earlier games, fans of the series remained somewhat optimistic in the build up to release. Personally I found myself feeling a mixture of excitement and anxiety, hoping that Firefly would rekindle the ashes of Stronghold and Stronghold Crusader and avoid giving us another flop (…cough cough looking at you, Stronghold 3)  Stronghold Crusader 2  The action starts straight away with a cinematic showcasing the iconic Templar Swordsman pitted against a Whirling Dervish, one of the newly introduced mercenary troops. A great little addition to build some atmosphere before getting to the main menu.  Jumping into single player, gamers are given a variety of options including the Skirmish Trails campaign, Custom Skirmish and Sandbox. These options include plenty of tutorials for newcomers and players who need to dust off their swords and bows before jumping in to the main campaign. Tutorial missions teach the basics of building your castle and surviving out in the desert whilst the Learning Campaigns gives players the opportunity to implement all the tools they have learned. After you’ve had your fill of practice, the main Skirmish Trails await. Acting as the main campaign, this set of Trials pits you against multiple enemies in a variety of scenarios, requiring different approaches for each enemy and terrain that you encounter. The Trials are split into a six missions trees, helping break up the relatively time consuming campaign into more manageable chunks.  My initial impressions of the tutorials missions were that they are infuriatingly restricted in terms of available buildings, troops and ways to complete the obnoxious goals such as destroying every single piece of rubble or painfully waiting for a set number of resources to be collected. My feelings about the Learning Campaigns are slightly more positive, at least they have an element of challenge and a variety of strategies to achieve the mission objectives. In hindsight I do appreciate that these missions are heavily tailored for newer players and provide an environment to learn all the basics and ante up the degree of difficulty until they reach the same playing field as more veteran fans of the series. Yet the sheer amount of training missions is what seems unnecessary, especially given that players will need to endure hours of patronising gameplay to unlock all available achievements.  The Skirmish Trials do a valiant effort at injecting some fun and excitement into the game, offering a wide variety of challenges by mixing up your enemies, allies, map size and access to resources. The learning curve is steep right off the bat, with quick decisions and a fast clicking finger being vital. There’s a fine balance to be struck between getting your economy up and running whilst also prepping your defences for the incoming attacks that happen extremely soon due to the rush-happy nature of AI opponents.  Stronghold Crusader 2  After sinking 20 hours of gameplay into the campaign I can safely say that there is an element of repetition between the missions. Is it because of the rinse and repeat approach of spamming overpowered archers until you have enough gold and troops to blitz the enemy? Is it because resources are so scarce, forcing you to twiddle your thumbs and wait? Is it because peasants spawn painfully slow and hovels are woefully overpriced? Probably a mix of all 3, plus countless other aggravating features. Talking of annoying features, let’s quickly address the voice acting and narrations. Irritating opponents such as “The Rat” have been a staple of the franchise since the initial Stronghold. Well, if the Developer’s aim was to annoy players then they sure succeeded. The voice acting seems poor quality throughout and the repetition of phrases seems more apparent than it should be for a reputable game produced in 2014. Fortunately the soundtrack provides some saving grace, providing an enjoyable ambience whilst you go about your medieval business.  There are some redeeming features to the game. The inclusion of unlimited stockpiles, granaries and armouries are welcomed additions. As are the improvements to team AI who are surprisingly competent and respond to your trade requests unlike in the first Crusader game. The easy-to-manage popularity metre is also a nice touch, allowing players to balance positive and negative popularity contributors to find the sweet spot between taxation and resources. The graphics, whilst not extraordinary, remain nostalgically reminiscent of the first Crusader game and the improvements of seeing towers shudder and walls crumble under your siege assault is certainly rewarding.  If you fancy a change from the pre-set missions there are a variety of choices to wet your castle crushing appetite. Creating your own scenarios allows players to edit maps, starting resources and computer controlled Lords. Moreover, if you crave even more customisation feel free to create your own maps in the Sandbox or download some user-created maps from the community. This contributes to the replayablility that the game offers, giving an almost infinite combination of enemies, maps and ways to conquer your opposition. There is also the option of jumping in to Multiplayer for a real challenge. There does seem to be a relative lack of lobbies though, so my recommendation would be to grab some buddies to bulk out the numbers. If, when it comes to your friends, you’re more of a lover than a fighter, there’s the chance to play co-operatively and take control of the same castle. This was one of the new features promoted during the build-up to the game, but in reality it’s quite gimmicky and leaves me with the disgruntled opinion that it’s simply more fun to control separate keeps and team up as normal.  Stronghold Crusader 2  Overall Stronghold Crusader 2 just doesn’t do enough to win me over. It’s a noticeably better game than recent instalments in the Stronghold series, but if Firefly hopes to rekindle the success of the earlier games in the franchise they still have a way to go. The lack of innovations and major improvements over the original game is underwhelming to say the least, there is also a feeling amongst the community that the focus is much more combat focused rather than actually building up your castle and infrastructure, a sign of the times in modern gaming. I frequently found myself not even bothering with a castle and opting instead for a few strategically placed towers filled with archers. Ultimately the game is a satisfactory addition to the RTS genre, but the slow paced growth and underwhelming improvements over the original game leaves me reluctant to recommend it to anyone other than hardcore fans of the series and genre.

Heres why: -FAR less units than the original -Absolute nightmarish AI with infinite resources. Expect them to already have a castle and an army headed your way in 5-7 minutes. -I got bored of the campaign. Rather quickly too. -Laggy for some reason -Watered down gameplay. Once upon a time, Stronghold was known for being a castle-sim RTS. And boy, were the older games SO MUCH FUN. Now? Its a watery, poor RTS. Really Firefly? What happened? All you had to do was make a sequel to the original crusader. Does anyone remember having cool things like executing criminals and inspiring fear to your own people? How about the old Honor system? Castle feasts to gain honor? ITS ALL GONE HERE. Its a bit VERY sad that the original Crusader had about 42.7 times more content. I think you were better off doing a 3D remake. Not this. -Instead of fixing the game, Firefly makes some DLC's. I understand you are a small company, but you already milked those that bought this 50 bucks each. At this point, you don't NEED more money.  -I don't know if this still happens, but even with 3 other people in a multiplayer game, it will either crash or disconnect. Fun. -It takes FOREVER to get resources. I do not recall it taking THIS long in Stronghold 2 + Stronghold Legends. -Again, Firefly could've had something going on here. but I couldn't tell you what happened. But the game just feels empty and not really finished. -Am I done yet? No. -There were interesting choices, like using the Havok engine for destruction. It DOES feel good when you tear down an enemy wall or tower. BUT the wall or tower will just re-appear momentarily. -Strategy? What? You think this was Strategy? I've played this game long enough to tell you that even if you DID get an army of units, you'll notice there is NO thinking involved when you attack. This is because there are 2 main types of units, and a few Special Mercenary units that attack in different ways. The Mercenaries were an interesting touch, to be honest, but if you see a large force of Arabian Knights heading your way, you'll notice your archers basically tickle them to death from a distance with arrows. Literally the only way to counter the tougher units like Knights is with Knights. The only thing to be concluded about strategy here is that Archers are used for taking out unarmored units and enemy peasants, and the tougher Melee units are only good for countering units of the same type. Fun. On top of that, the AI still has infinite resources and can spam such said Knights and such said Archers before you can blink. -Even worse is that back then, it felt pretty cool to be able to siege and starve out a faction's castle or spread diseases by launching sick cows. You can launch diseased animals in SC2, but its just an area of effect that deals some damage over a little bit. As for starving them out? Nope. -False advertisement. I will quote something from the description that makes me laugh every time: 'Crusader 2 recaptures the original game’s addictive, fast-paced gameplay and authentic castle simulation'. What fast-paced gameplay? You mean being rushed by the AI before you can recruit one guy is fast-paced? Authentic Castle Simulation? What are you simulating exactly? Nothing. The only thing to look at in a castle are the citizens moving about, gathering resources, etc. Thats it. No feasts, no jousts, no guards chasing criminals, no criminals rotting in a jail, no criminals being tortured, no criminals period. No falconers, dung patrol guys, no jester wandering around, no women tending to the households and going about, Nothing but people walking around. Sigh. Just a boring, plain castle with next to having absolute zero life in it.  You know, if Firefly would have created a sequel by following in the footsteps of the original and grabbing a few things from the previous Strongholds, it would've been worthy of the 50 dollar price tag. I can't even fathom this game being sold for any more than 10 dollars. I would rather see the old 2D crusader ported into 3D, with the same units and stuff. That would've been much more worth it. But I just CANNOT understand HOW these guys messed up. They have the IP of a game that could quite possibly DESTROY the other RTS games out there. They could've gone more in-depth and perhaps added bigger maps, a territory system that you see in games like Rise of Nations, more units, actual strategic thinking, Hell, even some decent optimisation and a really high unit cap would've turned the tables. It seems like the graphic quality of this game surpasses the actual gameplay too.  If you read this enormous wall of text I typed out, I thank you for reading this rant. If you are thinking of buying this game, GO BUY THE STRONGHOLD COLLECTION. It costs less and just ONE of the Strongholds it comes with has LOADS more content than this... abomination. It pains me to write this because this was once a respected series, and now its come to this.",

There are no tooltips, no stats: how do I know (if I'm ignorant and/or new to medieval RTS) the difference between a pikeman and a swordsman ? I don't.  Let's talk about the graphics now... Well, PC games had better graphics in 1998. And let's not talk about the UI. Or the intro cinematic. Remember Warcraft 2 intro cinematic ? You've got an idea of what I'm talking about.   Oh and the maps... well, they look like a 10 years old kid made them in about 15 minutes each: most of them are squares within squares on a squared map. If you love symmetry, you'll love them. Nothing more to say, except it's pathetic.  As if it wasn't enough, the game is also full of bugs. I only played a couple of hours and already found a few:  - I once build a building on a place where cactii were growing. When you place the building, the cactii do not get razed, and they block the way, preventing my peasants to reach their working place. - Walls. This game is about building strongholds and castles right ? Better be careful then because if you make a mistake, good luck fixing it. About half the walls I placed couldn't be erased. You just can't target them... - Game was running somewhat smoothly (thank god, I got a beast computer) until I set some buildings on fire.

            "review_text": "I had this awful realization as I got into Stronghold Crusader 2: I hated the desert.  That's some seriously bad news for a game whose main feature is the fact that it's an RTS that plays out across entire deserts, on small 'Kingdom of Heavearn'-style maps where your stompy swordsmen, plodding archers, speedy horses, catapults, and even sling thrower units have scarcely vanished over one horizon before they come swarming over the other. 'How much,' I asked, 'do I have to pay for a version with normal 2D maps?'  But then you start zooming out, and begin to realize that while you're able to see more territory, the curvature of these tiny castles means that you can still only see a fraction of the playing surface before you have to spin the camera to another position over the desert. It's a fog-of-war you can never dispel; even when you have intel coverage of an entire desert, your situational awareness is severely reduced.  Those big problems would be enough to make Stronghold Crusader 2 a flawed-but-fun experiment. What sinks it, tragically, is the lack of care and attention shown to the details and player aids. For starters, there’s little in-game help, and what's there is worse than nothing. I launched the tutorial to see what I was missing, and was treated to a low-res YouTube video that seemed more like a pitch for Stronghold Crusader 2 than a guide to playing it. Note to developers: Googling unofficial Stronghold Crusader 2 wikis to learn the basics of your game’s controls is not an appropriate substitute for a manual, and promo videos explaining the rudiments of RTS games are not substitutes for a tutorial.  To Stronghold Crusader 2's credit, the 'picture-in-picture' option makes it easier to juggle two things at once, and does a great job of giving multi-monitor advantages to single-monitor users. On the other hand, it's not as good as actual multi-monitor support, a feature that’s desperately needed but does not seem to be supported. In fact, I think my preferred setup for play would be one of those banks of security camera monitors - maybe then I could see all the angles I need to..  Even more unforgivable is the lack of a save option, either in single-player skirmish or in multiplayer. (There’s no single-player campaign.) This is a big game and, like a lot of its predecessors, things can drag on for more than an hour as up to eight sides bash away at each other. Yet Stronghold Crusader 2 gives you no option to save your skirmish or multiplayer game to pick it up later. That's a shocking oversight, as is the fact that you must be online to play even a single-player skirmish.  On the other hand, it's in keeping with a general 'half-baked' quality that pervades Stronghold Crusader 2. There's no faction design, just different skins for the all-important Crusader units who lead identical armies of swordsmen and archers. Maybe faction design matters slightly less in this style of RTS, where mass production and weight of numbers carries the day over individual unit tactics, but the lack of variety is still disappointing.  Even the good ideas end up going to waste. Stronghold Crusader 2 has a promising 'Crusade Trail' mode in which you lead your faction from keep to keep, headhunting other crusaders, unlocking new siege equipments, and conquering territory. Trouble is, it's paper-thin and once again badly executed.  The 'strategic' layer is no such thing. Your choice of where to go and who to fight is entirely meaningless. It is effectively solitaire. Second, you only have access to a fraction of the siege equipment tree. You have to expand your options by exploring the galaxy as your conquer it, and choosing which siege equipments to keep and which to permanently discard.  That's a nifty idea, except that it's so restrictive as to be annoying after a little while. For instance, in one mission I ended up stuck on two deserts, but I was siege equipment-locked out of the sling thrower combat units I needed to clear the space above my AI adversary's final stronghold. My unarmed transports were swarmed by his sling thrower interceptors every time, and I could never establish a foothold. So I had no choice but to build a barrage of 14 trebuchet cow launchers and just spam the desert until, by blind luck, I nailed his Crusader. It was a 100-minute match, and 40 minutes of that was just waiting for archers to finish. I guess I could have built giant siege engines to smash one siege tower into another, but only on certain maps that have mineable quarries – and that would’ve taken even longer. Besides, I don't think I had that siege equipment, either.  Sadly, that was one of the better solo games in Crusade Trail. The AI doesn't seem to know what to make of the limited build options, and rarely put up a fight. Too often, I'd find the enemy Crusader just running around the wilderness, waiting to get mugged. In a skirmish, the AI held its own, but the Crusade Trail adversary seemed to have trouble building a factory. It's just no fun playing such an opponent, so what could have been a gentle, easy way to learn to play turns into a slog from one arabian keep to another.  But the biggest problem with Stronghold Crusader 2 is that it's nowhere near as good as the games its consciously aping. Stronghold Crusader, made all the way back in 2002, is still better than this game. Either of the Extreme Crusader games (and especially Extreme Crusader: Forged Alliance) leaves Stronghold Crusader 2 in the dust, and they're a whole lot cheaper. There is simply no reason to play this game when those others are still better in every respect.  In all, It's okay. 8.5/10",

Overall I cannot recommend this game to someone looking to drop into the stronghold series as this is a sad addition to the Stronghold family. I can on the other hand recommend this to a previous Stronghold series follower simply because, as previously stated, it is a stronghold game and still has a very distant feel to it. ",

I know there would be bugs (what game doesn't have them) and with the graphics people seem to forget it uses the same engine as 3.

None of your decisions feel relevant; it doesn't matter what you produce only that you outproduce the enemy. From a technical standpoint this game would have been reasonable if it was released in 2005 but not as good as say, Age of Empires III. That's right. It requires a new gaming machine with graphics that look 10 years old. I wouldn't even recommend paying the sale price of $10 but maybe I would spend a buck on it. Then again I don't really want it screwing up my collection which is full of great games. Fun could be had but why bother when the originals still play great, look great, and are just plain classics.

What annoys me the most though is that I’ve spotted three spelling/grammatical errors in as many hours of play, one was even voice acted.  After closing the multiplayer support for stronghold 2 I thought we’d be provided with a decent game by firefly studios, I was mistaken. I had heard bad reviews but thought people were just whingeing about a buggy launch like total war games. Still I was cautious, I bought the game on sale for $15.00, and now I regret it.   Does firefly studios even try anymore? I guess they’re making much more money out of Stronghold Kingdoms than these games.
