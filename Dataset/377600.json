            "review_text": "I see that upon release this game only costs £0.79. This makes me happy. 10/10  But for serious, this is a cute little game a definitely worth the money. Now quick disclaimer - I, having spent the majority of my childhood living in the 2000's, am not one to be prone to retro game nostalgia, despite enjoying games with similar format to games from the 80's years later.  'Tcheco in the Castle of Lucio' is a 2D platformer, in which the objective is to collect the key on each screen in order to open the door to the next. It sounds simple, but there are no respawns, and you have only one life (with multiple hitpoints). This means playing the game over and over, each time improving a little, and making it further than before, which may sound tedious and frustrating, but actually leads to a great sense of accomplishment once progress is made.  The graphics remain faithful to the NES style it attempts to replicate. The music sounds similarly authentic, and each melody is upbeat and enjoyable. The controls are pretty fluid, personally I believe working better with a controller. Fortunately this game does indeed have full controller support, although I've yet to try it with a 3rd party gamepad (only used an Xbox controller). There's no options menu as such in the game, and windowed mode plus additional resolutions would be nice.  Overall, cheap game, fun. Give it a go. 7/10",

The music, the controls, the way the character moves, jumps, the enemies and layout of the levels is all spot on. Great work at re-creating the NES feeling and with this cool character finally getting his own game!",

Also, no in game options for volume control which you will really wish you had after you hear Tcheco scream for the hundreth time acompanied by a 10 second music loop. Pretty disapointing considering there have been plenty of great NESesk games coming out recently.",
