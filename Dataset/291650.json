            "review_text": "After over 100 hours I finally finished Pillars of Eternity and I think I'm ready to write this review. Is this game good? It's more than good, it's great. It's not only one of the best RPGs of all times, it's also one of the best games I've ever played. It has great story, beautiful graphics, sound and music, deep mechanics and everything what good RPG game needs. But don't expect revolution, this is just step ahead in comparison to best classics like Baldur's Gate. So what you may expect? Pillars of Eternity is pure old-school RPG in modern times. Engine is very classic, but modern in the same time. So you have 2D view, but with zoom. Combat is in real time with active pause. There is a lot of reading and dialogues. You will spend a lot of time to manage your party stats, skills and inventory. I played in hard difficulty and it was necessary to survive. What about world and mechanics? There is new world and RPG mechanics made by Obsidian, but it has a lot in common with Dungeons and Dragons. It's heroic fantasy with many races (there are elves and dwarves too) and classes (like paladins, warriors and clerics), which combines elements we all know and love, with some new ideas, which is great. One word about spellcasters. I love the way how each magic class is different to each other, they use totally different spells and strategy, there are many fresh ideas here. Also other thing is great. Best dialog system I've ever seen. Here you may feel your how your reputation and stats affects your dialog options. But not everything is perfect. There are some things in that game, that would be improved, like your castle for example. This is clear that potential of this idea isn't fully exploited. Sometimes I felt like this part of the game was done in a rush.  VERDICT: If you're an old-school RPG fan, this is must have for you. With this game you will feel the same magic as you felt playing Baldur's Gate. If you're younger player, I'm not sure you will be so delighted as I am. I can recommend this game to everybody but I know there are many people which expect more intense RPGs in modern style. So if you like to read a lot and think what to do, try this game and find the ancient magic.  Like this review?

I have currently played near 23 hours of this game, this is the most immersed in a game I have been in for ages. I don't want to stop, to eat, to go to sleep, I must keep playing! I haven't come across any bugs like other people have, the biggest bug I've come across is a piece of armour named after a potion. Yep, game-breaking bug right there.  The only complaint I have is that my person can't romance anyone. Oh well, she and her wood-elf friend Aloth will be the best of friends forever! I know it!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO YOU! IF!!! You can handle beautiful yet outdated graphics, and oh my gosh, a bit of reading.",

            "review_text": "Pillars of Eternity is an isometric CRPG from the studio that brought us Fallout: New Vegas and South Park: The Stick of Truth. One night you are travelling with a caravan through an area north of the Gilded Vale. The caravan stops for everyone to rest and you go out to get water for the group, you return to find a group of mercenaries who have killed all but one member of the caravan, a strange phenomenon occurs and you are forced to flee through a cave. When you reach the other side you find a strange ritual taking place and when it is complete, something about you is different. In Pillars of Eternity you must venture through Eora to find out what this change is and how you can reverse it.  PoE is set in the fictional realm of Eora. Eora is full of different factions and races and as you play the game you will discover how they link to each other and why as well as discovering the rest of Eora's deep and incredibly well thought out lore.  A couple of things to note before you carry on reading my review. Firstly I have not finished this game at the time of writing my review, I'd say I'm about a fifth of the way in but I feel like I've experienced enough of it to write a detailed review. Secondly this is the first time I have properly played a CRPG and so I'm inexperienced with this type of game so some of my opinions may differ from CRPG veterans.    The Game Itself ",

The first hour of the game reminded me of the magical times I had playing Baldurs Gate, Icewind Dale, and Planescape Torment as a teenager. I don't know how they managed to do it, but they have made, in my mind, the perfect homage to the old in a modern package. This is what PC Gaming should be. This IS what PC Gaming is today. I cannot reccomend this game enough for anyone who even moderately enjoys roleplaying games, tactical combat, or anything with a good story.   10/10. We can all hope that we get a steady dose of expansions and sequels.",

            "review_text": "It's finally out. Jesus, just when I was getting my life on track...  Pillars of Eternity is, hands-down, the best game in its genre since Baldur's Gate II.  So, yeah. Anyone who ever played any Infinity RPGs for fifty hours straight knows what I'm talking about. Huge, isometric, story-driven games which emphasized immersion in worlds where your choices mattered, your mistakes were painful and the story was engaging. Sure, you had to read giant blocks of text and fight uphill battles that you could lose at the roll of a die, but both of these activities were immensely rewarding in themselves, because the writing was top-notch and the tactics you had to employ against your enemies had to be both creative and abide by Gygax's Tome of Neverending Rules to succeed. This was obviously before they slapped the RPG label to streamlined generic space operas or sandbox Bethesda countryside crawlers with bad writing and worse design.   Pillars of Eternity takes place in Eora, which might seem as a garden variety fantasy world at first, but quickly establishes its own identity as you discover that souls can be seen and interacted with and are considerably more palpable than the metaphysical malarkey you normally use to pick up drunk hippy chicks at pretentious parties. Add the political intrigue of separatist colonies and the invention of gunpowder into the mix and you get a uniquely deep universe in which you will have to use cunning, diplomacy and brute force in equal measure to stand a chance.  While both the classes and mechanics are basically modernisations of the D&amp;D archetypes and rulesets, enough has been built on top of them to improve the overall experience: you have an infinite inventory for junk, craftable food, potions and enchantments provide secondary activities that enrich your arsenal and there's a really clever compromise between streamlined gameplay and the typical Dungeons and Dragons downtime which separates your encounter health pool (called Endurance) from the general health pool (which you can only regenerate by resting). The cherry on top is the stronghold you get to conquer and own fairly early in the game, and investing into its various buildings not only beautifies the initially decrepit keep, but also provides bonuses, NPCs and a recurring supply of gold.   The graphics are gorgeous, giving a painterly feel to the backgrounds and overcoming the technical limitations the Infinity engine had 17 years ago (dynamic water, convincing particle effects and modern resolutions being just the obligatory minimums), while retaining the general feeling gamers had exploring Faerûn. Even the classes and spells are pretty much the same, with occasional renames (presumably to avoid copyright infringement), though their efficiency has been tampered with and itemization is much less restrictive than it used to be.   If what you read appeals to you, then, by all means, buy this game. It's worth every penny and you'll get your money's worth in gametime, guaranteed. If you're like me, which is to say an absolute loser with no future and zero qualifications, you'll probably have the time to run through it within a week, but if you spread your doses responsably enough you'll probably be playing this a few months from now. Regardless of how immersive and brilliant this game will seem three hours in, don't forget to walk your dog, hang out with your friends and bang your girlfriend 'til she smiles.  ",

            "review_text": "Up until now, I had never played an isometric RPG like this and I figured I'd add in my two cents for others like myself. My previous experience has been with games like Skyrim, the Mass Effect series, various shooters and an assortments of strategy games. With that in mind, I was a little concerned that the pacing of this game would be an issue (having to pause repeatedly in combat, reading through a lot of text, the lack of flashy special effects and cutscenes, etc...). Not only is it not an issue, I found that it was quite relaxing! This game makes me want to play it while drinking a cup of hot tea while sitting in front of a crackling fire. It's an experience to be taken slowly and savored. I spent about 30 minutes in the character creation alone and loved all the various options that went into crafting the perfect hero.  I read some copmplaints here about the graphics quality, but it was a non-issue to me. In fact, I have found that to be one of the things working in its favor. In a weird way, not being bombarded with flashy special effects and cutscenes is one of the things that has helped make the game more immersive and relaxing to me.  I highly recommend this game. It's deep, immersive and the story and world is charming and interesting. It requires time and thought and is not a game that is designed to be rushed through, but I feel that it does a great job at rewarding the player's time investment.",

            "review_text": " Pillars of Eternity  is the best roleplaying game I've played since Neverwinter Nights.  It's a classical western fantasy RPG - the player guides a party of adventurers through an epic journey, where the fate of the world just might hang in the balance.  It's clear that Pillars draws heavy inspiration from Dungeons &amp; Dragons - when creating a character, the player chooses a race and class, then assigns attributes and skills, and the game mechanics are obviously supported by a rigid ruleset and powered by virtual dice rolls. In addition, some of the classes, weapons, etc. may be familiar to D&amp;D aficionados, but Obsidian has done an outstanding job of creating a distinct, vibrant world for Pillars of Eternity, from a wide variety of races and (orthogonal, in some cases) cultures to a range of traditional and innovative classes to geography and folklore to political rivalries to its own pantheon of living deities, around which the main storyline revolves.  Many of the reviews of this game mention Baldur's Gate, and with good reason - gameplay-wise, Pillars borrows heavily from BG: isometric perspective, formation-oriented party management, fast-paced realtime combat with a variety of conditional autopause settings, even the 'You must gather your party before venturing forth' message when transitioning between areas. However, these are all good things ( maybe not the message ), and everything feels right, whether exploring the wilderness, creeping anxiously through a crypt, navigating a bustling city, or frantically trying to survive an ambush. I particularly enjoyed an original mechanic they've added: there are several sections where the player is guided through a sort of illustrated choose-your-own-adventure sequence, where the various options may involve intuition, tactics, or skill checks, and will almost certainly have nontrivial consequences.  I do have a few minor quibbles: for example, it's possible to accept at least one of the optional quests and get fairly entangled in it before realizing that there's no hope of completing it at the party's current level. Each entry or exit from even the most insignificant building involves a loading screen, which means that exploring new town or village becomes a long sequence of these screens, divided by short segments of walking between buildings. Finally, the player, through a special ability she gains early on, is able to gain insight into the lives of many of the non-playable characters - however, these insights have absolutely no impact on the game in any way.  The story is epic, complex, and engaging - one of the finest I've encountered in a computer RPG, and the personas and backstories of the auxiliary playable characters the player will encounter on her travels weave seamlessly in, enriching the depth and color of the experience.  All in all, Pillars of Eternity is a fantastic game, and I would unhesitatingly recommend it to any roleplaying enthusiast.",

            "review_text": "Pillars of Eternity is average, enthusiastic fan fiction.  Don't get me wrong. I loved BG1. And BG2. But not so much Throne of Baal. And Planescape: Torment is one of the best games I've ever played. However, Pillars of Eternity just feels like it was cobbled together by some diehard fans who couldn't let go. They're writing fan fiction to relieve the 'glory days'.  The story itself is so so, and it can't decide if it wants to take itself seriously or wants to be a tongue in cheek fantasy parody. For example, there's an endless dungeon filled with vampires and mages and monsters right underneath your home, called the Endless Paths of Od Nua. Seriously? And the game takes pains to remind you in every town and forest you go to that it was crowdfunded, with little in-jokes and even name lists of sponsors plastered everywhere. The big reveal at the end is predictable and underwhelming, especially since it basically begs the questions: 'okay, so what?' and 'so what exactly am I supposed to do about it? if anything?'  As for the system itself, it's a D&amp;D pastiche. Unlike Dragon Age: Origins, ShadowRun or even Risen, there's no reason for why the character classes are in the setting. It's just a grab bag of D&amp;D tropes. Let's get the monk, the psychic, the barbarian, the druid, etc. etc. and copy paste them into our take on Forgotten Realms. You've got your elves and half-orcs (sorry, Aumaua), and dwarves. Whatever race and class you pick, don't worry. It has virtually no impact. The only thing the game tries to do for originality is that it combines attributes together in new and crazy ways, to pretend it's fresh and creative. However, why a fireball-hurling wizard needs to be a mountain of muscle to do real damage doesn't make any logical sense to me!  All in all, this game will appeal to two types of gamers. The old-school Icewind Dale and Baldur's Gate fans who can't move on, and think modern games are rubbish. And secondly, for people new to the genre who want to be old school without having to deal with the dated graphics and hardcore difficulties of the really old games.  Me? I thought the game was alright. A weak 3 out of 5. But I prefer to both replay my old favorites AND enjoying the new, cutting edge RPGs, rather than get lost in fan-fiction recreations of old legends. YMMV.",

            "review_text": "Honestly, this is only a thumbs-down because there is no way of putting something 'middle ground', and with all those positive reviews, potential buyers must beware of this game's flaws.  Before starting, I'm a veteran of this kind of rpg, Baldur's Gate Saga, Icewind Dale, Planescape Torment (my favorite of all time), I've played it all, so you know I won't be some 'noob' who bumbles around with the controls and is incapable of handling a manual.  Pillars of Eternity is an important game in this generation that was forcefed games made by publishers that had no contact with their public, it was successfully financed by the public, and from that standpoint Obsidian was more than successful. This game was made with love, and with lots of holes...  Starting with the good aspects, every companion so far has interesting stories to tell and different personalities that can be deep. The way the characters are generated are meant to avoid Minmaxing, every single stat can help any kind of character in some way, enabling different builds for different classes. Speaking of which, equipment works differently. Every weapon has pros and cons, and any class can use anything. A wizard can use heavy plating, a warrior can use a long-range wand, heavy armor makes actions slower, and certain enemies are immune to certain kinds of damage, so you can't rely on a single sword all the time. The music made by Justin Bell is... practically a carbon copy the old rpgs like Baldur's gate's Michael Hoenig (Which is a good thing). There is a diverse set of quests for you to take care of, some have pretty emotional stories to tell, and there is always something hidden for you to see.  Other good thing is the time manipulation, you can not only make time run faster, but slower, good to micro-manage a fight. SPOILERS, you get a keep, and the ability to manage some sort of building or fortress is always welcome on my book, provided you be able to -really- manage it (I'm looking at you, Baldur's gate 2, the precursor for 'hero gets a keep', but that frustrated me awfully due limiting said keep to just gain gold from time to time.) and in an interesting twist, you have not one, but two kinds of fame, local fame, and personal fame. Some actions can brand you as a specific kind of person, be charitable, and people will find you benevolent, be harsh, and you might get points as a Stoic person. And with bad/good reputation systems per region, like Fallout 2, you can really make yourself a hero of a thousand fames. I can't tell much about the plot, but it has its ups and downs. The game not only acknowledge helpers, but celebrate them, and here and there you will see names of backers in the shape of special npcs with unique stories and messages on cemeteries.  Now, for the bad part.  Every single trait explained before has huge, huge, huge flaws. Every single point explained can be insanely frustrating, sometimes nearly gamebreaking at times. The backers? You will see thousands of those characters just lying around waiting to be clicked and expecting you to read their stories time after time after time. After the first city, I started to ignore them altogether. They are EVERYWHERE and sometimes they can be downright immersion-shattering. None of them interact with you, in any way, they are just there to be basked upon and so their 'awesome stories' can be read.  Combat is a mess. The Allied A.I is so idiotic that it's nearly impossible to have a single fight without micromanagement. If they set on a target, they won't disengage from it without a direct command. Meaning, they can be mowed down by 'opportunity attacks' made by the enemies and worse, step on traps, run inside the area of a fireball (friendly or foe), and much worse. You can't tweak the A.I to me more specific than 'kill everything in sight' 'Only move if the enemy attacks you', and as another reviewer noted, the enemy AI knows how to work VERY WELL as a team. You can't buff your team before fights, you can't lay more than ONE TRAP and ONE SPELL TRAP, which severely limits strategy. The cleric spells are nearly useless, since many of the status effects that low level enemies can cause on you (Paralysis, Dizzy, Charmed) can be only countered with high-level spells. Which you won't have. Skills are another mess, they are rarely used, useful, and only the main character can use his skills in interactions, meaning, if you are a wizard and spent all your points in lore, no matter if you have two super-warriors with 10 in athletics, you will have to waste a rope or cheat.   The devs wanted to avoid minmaxing? Awesome! Then why in the name of Bhaal they chose to put So many interactions with such a high stat requirements? I had to use 18 intelligence to haggle prices with a courtesan, but had to use -Resolve- to talk about an ancient relic with a scholar!? Oh, and you can't stack boosts given by items. Nice, no problem, except that the boosts given are just +1 or +2, items with +3 are awfully rare. Oh and either you get a cape, or a necklace... WHY!?  The quests... where to begin? I'm not against straightforward good vs. evil plots. Baldur's Gate 1 main criticisms was that evil characters were screwed because of the dualist nature of the game. I agree with the criticism, but I don't mind that, the game itself was honest in acknowledging it's nature. but many (thankfully not a lot) of quests in Pillars will offer a false sense of morality. A Moral Conundrum is when you can't choose based on the fact that each choice has equally convincing and important arguments. Pillars just pretends to give 'hard' moral choices by offering either something 'good', or something 'evil' that will give you an item, boost, or more money. Again, it would be all fine and dandy... except that Reputation hardly matters except in key points. It doesn't help you buying/selling stuff much, no random groups will try to hunt you down. And the game pretends to always offer you a 'third choice' if you have stats/skills, which it doesn't in points that would really matter. And many, MANY are severely flawed or bugged. There was a quest in which I had to save a group of soldiers from a banshee that enthralled them. I killed the banshee without a single soldier dying, only to discover that the devs never gave you an option of saving said soldiers. You have to kill them. Also, without a warning, you might be suddenly drafted into a faction without the option of getting out, if you merely accept a quest. And many, many personal quests with your companions won't change a SINGLE thing in their story. You could treat certain members awfully, insult them, but... nothing changes, you just gain xp.  The game allows you to make items, potions and scrolls, yaaayy! To make something really useful, you will need rare ingredients that rarely appear. The enchantments that you can place on a piece of armor or weapon are severely limited and expensive due said ingredients being rare, so you're better off buying weapons with a shopper, or finding special gear in dungeons.   For the last part, the Keep. Having a keep in itself is awesome, a place to call home, a base to build... except that the mechanics are utterly broken. See, to avoid making the players just sit on their asses waiting time to pass to collect money, the devs made time pass in the keep in two senses, turns, and days. Days are used to build stuff like walls and houses, and turns only pass when you finish quests. It has two special stats, security and prestige. They SUPPOSEDLY should bring you more money and guests (prestige), and protect said money and guests (security). I maxed them both, and my money kept getting stolen by bandits.  So, it's a good game, but be warned!",

            "review_text": "An exceedingly high quality RPG drawing inspiration from the the golden age of the genre, and PC gaming itself.   The easiest way to describe it is as a spiritual successor to Bioware's Infinity Engine games, like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale most notably. I don't want to devalue it with that term (same as how I felt another excellent game in the CRPG revival scene, Wasteland 2, was too often simplified as a successor to the isometric Fallout games) as it has a lot going for it. If anything I think it drew a lot of inspiration from Planescape: Torment, as well as 2009's cult classic Inquisitor. Pillars actually strongly reminds me of Inquisitor, just with tighter mechanics and better production values.   The lore itself isn't too out there, it's a fairly Tolkien-esque world. What really lifts it is the excellent writing quality and sheer abundance of it. The last game I can remember with such good writing was the aformentioned Planescape: Torment, back in late 1999. The game's lore is richly crafted and with a huge attention to detail. You can really get lost just reading the books and the cyclopedia. The in-game dialogue is similarly well done, it really has that cosy feel of DnD and 90s CRPGs but on a higher level of quality.   The other two strong points are the graphics and the strategic combat. The visual style of the game is just fantastic. Enviroments almost look like paintings and the lighting effects are especially notable. The production value of the game is as a whole, really good. Sound effects and music are both very well done too.   The combat is excellent too, it really pairs well with the deep RPG elements and character building. The system is based off DnD but is pretty much custom made for the game and it works very well. The combat is consistently enjoyable and different classes offer many different options for the player to approach and conduct combat with.   All in all, the game is another excellent release in the CRPG revival of recent years. Highly recommended for any RPG fan and practically a must buy if you're a CRPG fan. In the era of the action RPG, it's great to see games like Pillars of Eternity keep the old-school flame alive.",

            "review_text": "Huge disappointment (I helped to kickstart it, so no - I am not a guy who expected Diablo 4). The world is utterly boring and unimaginative (a copy of medieval Europe... without any twist), companions vary from good (Durance) through OK (Grieving Mother, Eder) to absolute rubbish (the rest... extra terrible is that dwarf who's totally not an inuit and who dumps walls of texts about seal hunting and other 'fascinating' stuff). I found out later that Carrie Patel was narrative lead - which explains a lot, I actually bought one of her books (I was really hyped for this game) and couldn't get past first 100 pages which is a rare thing for me. There's a ton of useless NPCs with some stories provided by backers (usually bad ones) - and although you can avoid them, they clutter cities and pubs and the whole idea of having them is completely silly. Other characters talk a lot but have nothing to say. I am a guy who enjoys 'games you can read through', but I expect some decent level of writing, not just an outlet for some untalented nerd's graphomania.  And don't make me start on game mechanics. All stats are dump stats, only your level matters.  Crafting and enchanting feels like... crafted... 2 hours before release.  Main antagoinst has charisma of shredded carrot. I actually couldn't even care about the story or what was going on, it was so boring. Actually, the game felt like Diablo 4 at times, since I was going through million instances of the same encounter where all I had to do was click on enemies in proper order, while getting annoyed with the engagement feature (good idea, bad implementation) - zero challenge, even on hard difficulty (except for that final fight under Caed Nua, for which you need level 12).

            "review_text": "As a huge fan of the old Infinite Engine games like Baldur's Gate I had hoped for so much *more* from this game. Whilst it did much to modernise the genre, in many areas it failed to live up to the nostalgia.  Graphics - The game kept true to the art style whilst bringing it forwards into the modern era of gaming, the backdrops were breathtakingly beautiful and it played smoothly without any issues.  Sound/Voice Acting - The sound/voice acting wasn't particularly noteworthy, it wasn't terrible yet it wasnt great either, it didn't really stand out much.  Story-telling/narrative - The story was a bit vague and didn't really have much direction during the first act but it quickly picked up during the second act before slowly tapering off towards the end. There weren't any really exciting revelations or twists that made it wow me. The villain, their motivations and relationship to the protagonist were somewhat interesting but it wasn't anything that stood out. Often at times to convey just how filled out the world and backstory was you're presented with a wall of text which probably wasn't necessary and felt like it detracted from the story at times.  Gameplay Mechanics/Combat - This is probably the most disappointing aspect of the game. The game feels like it's more of a stealth crpg because they limited the experience gained from combat to just the first few initial run ins with each foe type and kept the overall experience gained from combat to a very minimal amount, along with the plethora of items that dropped from enemies being utterly useless, it often felt like the better choice was to sneak/avoid enemy encounters which just slows down the pace of the game. Avoiding combat entirely was also made more desirable by the fact that you were heavily penalised for trying to escape combat or run around or disengage with an enemy during combat which often resulted in the character dying quicker than had you just stayed in place and tried to (but likely fail to do so anyway) tank it.   Spell casting also felt more burdensome and tiring than in the older IE titles because of the resting mechanics of the game whereby you had to carry supplies to rest and were limited to only carry a certain amount of supplies with you, so if you ran out of supplies you were forced to return to a store to purchase more or not rest and not be able to heal, or restore spells for combat.  Itemisation - The difference between a normal, un-enchanted item and a unique item felt lacking. The difference in damage was minimal, I played as a barbarian and would do 80s with normal items and as high as 96 using a unique item of the same type. Another problem with the itemisation is that so many items gave boosts to player stats, but conflicting stat boosts (ie. gloves that give +1 might and boots that give +2 might) would be nullified meant that gearing most slots felt like a waste of time and forced players down the route of jack of all trades, master of none.  Overall I would rate this game as a 6/10, or in terms of similarities to the old IE games it has the combat of Planescape Torment with the story of Icewind Dale, it tries to relive the nostalgia but focuses on the wrong aspects of what made them great games.",

I know the developers are trying to let you enjoy all classes and skills more, but such overhaul is just bad planning.",

            "review_text": "I'll keep this short for you: If you know what TSR, Black Isle, or Interplay are, you'll either nod knowingly or have things to flame me about, by the end of this. If not, you might have some poorly informed opinion-hate for me by the end, anyway. For safety's sake, if you still defend -- say, the D&amp;D alignment system, assume you will hate this review, and me. Oh well.  BUCKLE UP AND BRANDISH YOUR D20'S!  This will come as a strange response, from a player of older cRPGs, such as the Baldur's Gate series, Icewind Dale, Neverwinter Nights, and Planescape Torment, but, after playing Pillars of Eternity through to its resolution, I suddenly come to realize that the Infinity engine has not aged well.  The entire game is plagued by cliches of Tabletop gaming, and does little, either to adapt them for PC gaming beyond what Baldur's Gate and its successors already did, or to turn the conventions harshly on their head, the way Planescape: Torment's story was able. Even most of the enemies are ripped remorselessly from your Saturday night campaign, and given mildly gaelic redubs; Ghouls are Guls, Vampires are Fampyrs, Banshees are Cean Gwla, but it's blatantly transparent. The variety of enemies is even drastically down, from say, Baldur's Gate II. (You've got your typical 'horrible' living dead, bad-mouthed bandits and fanatical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ zealots, some slimes, some beasties, trolls, dryads, and dragons. Yay. I probably missed something and will be narked at about it. Bring me back killing my own mortality.)  Worse yet, I never felt the story came to any decent level of 'resolution', for my character--one needling plague of open-ended gameplay that eternally haunts.  For perspective for current gamers who are some five paragraphs in, and have never heard of Gary Gygax--if you felt like, say--the ending to Fallout 3 was stupid (having an anticlimactic final battle, being guilted to martyr yourself needlessly to someone else's morality, or suffering a lousy ending because you weren't a completionist when it came to sidequests), you'll feel cheated by the end of PoE, even when you think you're heading toward the ending you want--simply by the system of flags and scripts that determines what disappointing exposition scene you get. (No, Fawkes. You're not denying me my destiny, now get in the '♥♥♥♥ing' GECK chamber. I have a dog to walk away with while the narrator smugly talks about War. No, I am not buying the expansion DLC!)  While the end boss to PoE is wholeheartedly on the opposite end of the difficulty spectrum to Fallout 3's ending, you can bet that the outcome doesn't justify the effort.  Again for perspective, Torment's boss can be killed in dialogue, but provides a massively more satisfying resolution, that resonates with the overall 'message' of the game. The big bad of this game, by contrast, utterly refutes every line you throw, regardless of stats or what you've accomplished, to the point that you may as well fast-forward to immediate combat (--and past that, just turn on cheats, mouse over him and hit the key to shut him up.) Afterward, the game gives you the ending it has mathed out that you maybe could want, if Obsidian didn't have to spread itself thin covering all the bases (and you'd best bet they had to, the title was nearly their swan song.)  Even these things weren't dealbreakers, alone. What truly threw me out of the experience was simply reaching the end stretch of the game, and realizing just how little has changed from older cRPGs in the engine--in fact, in terms of gameplay, things have taken a backslide, in the sense that the descriptions for the function of many of PoE's items are vague at best, and the merits of many of the different stat tweaks and perks pale in comparison to just exploiting the shoddy AI of the Infinity engine. Many encounters I won simply by targetting a single difficult enemy and having a character run around in circles to distract it, or spamming summons and pinning the enemies in corners, while my expendable characters took their time shooting. And if I feel like I'm coming up with tricks to outsmart bits and bytes, and doing complex math before battles, rather than winning out of a sense of skill... welp... Screw math, I'll save that for making stock investments. Back to games that make me care, rather than teabagging my corpse over algebra.  MY BURNING QUESTION: IS +10 WILL more valuable than HITTING THINGS FOR 1.2x more DAMAGE?! I HAVE NO IDEA.  What made sense as a general guideline for pen-and-paper get togethers over chips and Mountain Dew has never worked particularly well as filler for functional gameplay, on Infinity's part. Hearing the same statistical song and dance try to dress up as something new and improved over twenty years later just makes me groan.  Point in Case: Borderlands 2 has a jumbled mess of statistics handed to me to sort out, for its guns--but I can tell what 'fire rate' or 'pellet count' or 'reload speed' are, without a glossary. If I get an amazing weapon, I can tell it's amazing at a glance, and it feels like an event. I know what elements on weapons are effective against what kinds of threats, at a glance, without a monster encylopedia. More to the point, the struggles of Roland and the Crimson Raiders, and the humour of characters like Hammerlock and Claptrap, keep me going in spite of needless number crunches that the devs may as well have handled. Pillars of Eternity gets as far as 'telling' me to care, and then 'literally' sets all my efforts on fire to advance its shallow tale, within the second act.  One particularly egregious example: I kill a raving mad local lord who is driving his village into extinction, and appoint his idealistic cousin as successor. By the end of my overly arduous final boss-fight, hidden numbers assigned with dealing out the game's ending montage have determined that my old foe gets up from being dead, goes even crazier, and wipes out everyone in said village before the end credits can even roll. And I have no say in it--how was I supposed to forecast that? ♥♥♥♥ move, game. Imagine if Handsome Jack got away with nuking Sanctuary despite your best efforts defeating the Warrior, in Borderlands 2. How lame would that be?  But since I'm not twinking out six me's with optimum gear and stats, maybe I'm not doing something right. I'll never know--I'll be playing other things. Tip for you geniuses of metagaming preparing to flame me: none of the enemies provide combat exp, and the level of encounters scales with your level. Fighting trash mobs produces equivalent results to running to the far end of the room. Have fun with your grind.  In summary: Pillars of Eternity neither renews the Infinity engine's myriad wrinkles, nor does it tell a particularly fresh or engaging tale. It's not particularly horrible either--just woefully over-promising, mediocrity on all counts. It was a lukewarm reminder that old things can get a second chance to show how well they've festered, and that's all a good little twink can ask for: spoilt milk and stale cookies with a great big fat +10 to some stat I'll have to look up the applications for, on the end.  There's always Torment: Tides of Numenara, coming Q4, right?",

It takes a classic formula and breathes new life to it in the form of a modern game with modern production values but all the atmosphere of the original Infinity Engine games. In addition, it takes a careful look at the mechanics, not tied to the AD&amp;D rules, and sets about determining what works and should be kept essentially as is, what doesn't and should be either jettisoned or improved, and what new things could be brought in to further improve the formula. The result is a game that, while not without flaws, is not just a worthy follower to classics like Baldur's Gate but an improvement in most ways that count. The main thing the game could be improved with would be a slightly larger selection of companions.  Still, if you're fan of cerebral, atmospheric CRPGs with lots of reading, good world-building and slick but not simplified mechanics, this game is for you.",

While it obviously cannot nearly keep up to the amount of content of a Baldur's Gate II, (lenght of the campaign, amount of optional quests, interesting storylines), it yet does some things better than its predecessors.  It is in every sense indeed a game for adults. Dialogues are very well-conceived and sophisticated, and so is the whole background of the story and this new world. Prepare yourself for a LOT of careful reading, if you want to really understand what's going on and take some insights from this game. If you don't, there is still a very good tactical fighting system to explore, but that's obviously not the major purpose here.  You find yourself confronted with truly hard moral decisions, where you really have to think about what's right and what's wrong. That is so because the game gives you absolutely no hints where things might lead you or what is now the 'good character'-choice. Sometimes I found myself staring for five minutes on some dialogue options before i chose one, thinking really hard what to answer. The game, in its way, rewards you for the effort, building plausible consequences even on the nuances of how your character behaves and what he says.  There is no black and white and grey like we are used to from the fantasy genre. Every situation is unique, and sometimes several or even all options lead to consequences that you can't morally justify, but yet you have to come to a decision!  It's just like in the real world.

            "review_text": "Do you enjoy spending hours at a time working on a branching questline only for all of your actions to be rendered completely pointless? Do you like micromanaging obtuse and obsolete game mechanics? Do you want a game that throws all its potential out a window in favour of being 'safe'? Then boy do I have a game for you!   Pillars of Eternity presents itself as a throwback to the classic CRPGs, like Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment. However, it actually comes across as a game made by people who liked those games but did not understand why they were good. Pillars throws at you the trappings of choice, of an interactive world, of interactive design, but does not actually include these in any meaningful way.  As an example, let's look at character creation. You're presented with a half-dozen options for races, all with different stats and backstory, then a handful of different class options based on the traditional DnD classes (fighter, wizard, rogue, bard, etc.) and then finish up with options for personalising the character's backstory, appearance, etc. Sounds great, right? Just what you'd expect. But when you come to actually play the game, you'll find that none of it really matters. The classes really just resolve into 'ranged' and 'not ranged', and everything else is just fluff. Your actual playstyle will be exactly the same whether you play a big, tough warrior or a small, sneaky rogue. The character options present different possibilities for interacting with the world, but these almost never actually come up in the story. If you play as a goblin (I don't care what you actually call them, they're still goblins), the game will tell you that your race is hated and discriminated against. This came up ONCE, in the 20-odd hours I wasted on this game. In a single option, hidden behind another conversation option, while talking with a single minor character.   Quests and storylines may have multiple ways of approaching them, and multiple ways of progressing, but almost all that I played ultimately had only one single outcome, which had nothing at all to do with what I did. You can spend hours at a time working carefully on choosing which faction you're going to support, choosing which quests to do for that faction, deciding how you're going to accomplish your quests from the several options presented to you, weighing the pros and cons of each possible outcome, only for all of this to be rendered pointless when the storyline progresses with absolutely no impact from you or your actions. The writers are determined to tell you their story, despite what you do, without you being involved in that story. There is no real choice, no actual 'multiple paths' as advertised, there is just 'well, that's nice, now here's what is ACTUALLY going to happen.'   Ultimately my problem with this game is that there is no real choice in anything. It is a crude imitation of what came before, with nothing new to add or innovations to include. 20 years ago, this game would have been a brilliant new addition to the CRPG library. It would have stood up against the best of its genre. Unfortunately, it's not 20 years ago. But I don't think the developers know that.",

            "review_text": "  *Review of original initial release only. Does not account for changes via DLC or subsequent patches.*  Pillars of Eternity is a triumph.  You start the game as just another traveller looking for a fresh start in a new land, flavoured by the choices you made during character creation. A LOT of terrible things happen and before long you are caught up in world where souls are endlessly reincarnated and the natural balance has been shattered. Some individuals can even see and manipulate souls. A lot of the strife, mystery and wonder in this game ties directly back to souls in some way, shape, or form.  Your attributes, talents and choices also ripple out into the greater world. It is not possible to be on everyone’s good side. Treat one group well and another group may become hostile to you for helping their enemies. NPC’s and main characters will react to your race, class, nationality and affiliations. Conversations are influenced by a number of factors, providing you with a number of different conversation options. All of which ties to a reputation system. This helps the world feel much more grey, with right and wrong being a matter of perspective.  The visuals are gorgeous if you have an appreciation for the style being used, even if the world could use a bit more colour in places. PoE does not have traditional cinematics. Instead players are given interactive text adventures with illustrations and sound effects that are directly informed by your stats and choices.   The writing is almost always exceptional. Far, far above the usual flavour text that wraps around typical binary conversations in other games. The text based dialogue and the voice acting are really great. You might not hear as much banter as you will in other games but what is there is entertaining and sometimes surprising. The 8 official companions all bring something unique to the table.  Character creation is one of my favourite parts of RPG’s. PoE is a wonderland in this respect. There are a lot of stats and mechanics to wrap your head around. You absolutely can build a viable character just following the on-screen tips and jumping into a game. The thing is, you won’t know WHY you are making those suggested choices. You’ll have descriptions to read sure, but you just won’t have an appreciation for the nuances of PoE‘s rule-set without experimentation. The game is setup in such a way that anyone can make a safe, viable character following the on-screen suggestions. Failure to Min/Max every damn stat won’t cripple you. Which is not to say you could not create a broken character, just that you’d have to travel pretty far off the beaten path to do it. By the same extent it is possible to break out “the maths” and attempt to make the most deadly backstabbing Orlan Rogue this side of Gilded Vale.  You have lots of choices when it comes to creating your character and they all come with some kind of stat. There are 6 races, 15 sub-races and 11 classes. Some of the races are fantasy stalwarts that have been given a PoE spin like Humans, Dwarves and Elves. Others are a bit more unique.  Combat in PoE is almost always a white knuckle affair. Fights happens in real time but you can pause and issue commands. As a bonus, you can also slow down or speed up time at the press of a button, allowing you that extra time to react to subtle changes on the battlefield or cross a big map as quickly as possible. During combat you have to keep in mind both your Endurance and your Health. Endurance represents how much of a beating your character can take before being knocked unconscious. You can replenish Endurance with items, abilities and spells. While most damage affects Endurance you will also lose Health during combat. Lose all your health and you’ll be maimed. Get hit again and you are dead. Companions can die for good. You can’t replenish Health or remove maimed status without resting at either a camp or an inn.  Party composition, formation, location and more all have major effects on combat. You have to play smart, not just bold. Your party is incredibly powerful so long as you make your choices with care. The enemies in PoE are super aggressive, varied and absolutely ruthless when it comes to hammering weakness. One of the ways PoE is different from other RPG’s is that the restrictions on equipment have been relaxed, meaning your casters can wear heavy armour and wield great swords if you want them too. There are considerations when it comes to armour of course, but it is nice that your casters and such don’t have to be so squishy.  PoE is not a game about grinding. Generally when you clear an area or map it stays cleared. Instead the game rewards players for exploration, discovery, completing quests and making choices. Whether you plan on fighting or sneaking your way through you are always going to have to be on your toes. You can’t just roll over anything you encounter. Some enemies will be too tough to beat. Some areas will be inaccessible without the right gear. You’ll have way more active quests and tasks than you can immediately complete. This means you need to make hard choices and return to questlines and areas when you are better equipped to tackle them.  Besides the standard questing and combat (and a million other little things to be honest), PoE has two big features I love. The first of which is your Stronghold Caed Nua. Once you’re done battling through the Stronghold proper it becomes your base of operations. You’ll repair its buildings, shore up its defences, man it with soldiers, send companions out on quests and more from within its walls. You can even manage it while you are away. In some aspects it may seem a bit dry, but there is enough incentive there to keep making progress. Sometimes your Stronghold will come under attack. Other times you’ll take someone captive and hold them in your dungeons until somebody begs for their release. Even though the game has 8 official companions, you can recruit your own custom made adventurers any time you want as long as you have the cash. Since you can only have 5 companions in your party at a time, when your companions are not traveling with you they can be running quests from the Stronghold for a variety of rewards.  The other unique feature I love is The Endless Paths, which is a sprawling mega dungeon underneath your Stronghold. It’s almost like a game within a game. You’ll encounter all sorts of monsters, heroes and quests as you fight your way deeper and deeper. The whole time you are rebuilding the Stronghold in the back of your mind you worry about The Master Below.  Playing on Normal will provide a serious challenge. You WILL die many, many times. Hard mode is just that; HARD. Playing on Path of the Damned difficulty is pure masochism. Players can even take it a step further by turning on Expert Mode which completely removes all hints and suggestions from the game. If you are feeling truly crazy you can even try playing the game with Trials of Iron turned on which gives you just one save and one life. If you die, that’s it.  The game also comes with some more subtle touches that have a big effect on the game. For one, you’ll never run out of storage space when you are out questing. Each of your companions can hold 16 items in their inventory, but everyone always has access to your party Stash, which as far as I can tell is bottomless. The UI is clean, practical and easy to use. The game allows you to control font size and includes a colour-blind mode.  As far as bugs and glitches go I’ve encountered very few. The game never crashed on me once. I had to reload a save once to get a quest to trigger and I encountered text wrapping around improperly during a conversation with a random NPC. That’s it.  *This review is heavily trimmed due to the limit Steam places on the length of reviews. Check out my profile for a link to the website I write for to see the full review.*",

            "review_text": "Pillars of Eternity is the type of RPG that can keep you on the character creation screen for hours. The moment to moment gameplay of Pillars is unlikely to surprise you if you've been following the revival of the CRPG genre through Kickstarter. You'll go on quests and slay dragons, and once your potentially 100 hour journey is complete you'll have read a couple novel's worth of text. Unfortunately the text is the superior half of the game; although some small improvements have been made to the CRPG formula a lot of its systems feel like they come right out of 1999.    Micromanagement is the name of the game here. Each member of your 6 person party can come equipped with what feels like dozens of spells. Every encounter is a test of both skill and patience if you plan on using your party members effectively. The game features a pause button for those who want to make the most out of all of their fighters, but I found this to chop up the combat and turn fights into a chore. I struggle to find a reason why the game uses real time combat at all, a turn based system like the one found in Pillars' Kickstarted cousin, Divinity: Original Sin, would feel more apt here. If you're like me you'll opt to push the difficulty down to 'Story Time' in order to breeze through combat and allow yourself to experience everything else the game has to offer.  The combat system in place doesn't use Dungeons and Dragon's ruleset, but that was near impossible to tell as an outsider. Characters hitting and missing are determined by dice rolls that are weighed by their statistics. If you love deciding whether you want the chest piece with 12 Resolve but lower Athleticism then you'll love min-maxing all of your character's loadouts, but I found the games ruleset to be a bit complex for my tastes. I much prefer when I have a great amount of choice in how I want my characters to perform not through small stat changes, but through large easy to comprehend choices; something akin to World of Warcraft's post 2010 talent system.  Spells are handled on a 'per rest' and 'per encounter' system, where more powerful spells can only be used a limited amount of times until you get your characters back to an inn or campfire. Weaker spell are limited by how many times you can cast them in a given fight. Though this system will likely appeal to those who want to map out their descent into a dungeon, I found it really constricting and made me reluctant to use any of my character's cool abilities at all. Though my piece on the game doesn't look like a glowing recommendation so far, it was actually one of my favorite games of 2015. Though the clunky combat and complicated rules were large gripes of mine, that's where most of my issues with the game end. Pillars succeeds tremendously in nearly every other aspect, most importantly is how much it allowed for players to role play. Player agency in all aspects of the game was clearly a huge design philosophy for Obsidian, it's apparent from the moment you make your character. Your character's race, class, and background will influence the way other characters interact with you as well as opening up new dialogue options. Although all of this seems par the course, it's the superb writing that brings the role playing to life.  Regardless of how you allocate your stat points, your character will be a Watcher: a person who can look into the soul of others. Though this gift starts as but a faint whisper, you will eventually be able to read the intentions of others that you talk to as well as manipulate their soul. Souls end up being a driving force of the plot of the game as well. You will hear from many a townsfolk about 'Waidwen's Legacy', a supposed curse that prevents newborn children from being born with souls and are instead born as hollow shells. The matter of souls also ties into the games many religious themes. The in-game deities play a large role in the game's world and you'll find yourself opening your codex to refresh yourself on them many times. Understanding each of the provinces' deities as well as the gods of your followers is important to understanding the plot as well as the world's history. Religious themes in art can occasionally turn off people but the game's messages about religion are handled with grace and don't come off as overly preachy.  The characters you'll meet on your adventure are layered and complicated, specifically your party members. Out of the eight total companions in the base game I only found one to be boring, but even as the weakest of the bunch she's more compelling than most characters in other big budget role playing games. Each companion has their own personal quest that could have been a game of its own. You'll definitely want to pursue these quests as they contain a bulk of the characterization in the game, which is arguably the titles' strongest point. I found most of the quests to be an emotional roller coaster, some ending in tremendous highs and others ending in crushing lows. What's important to note about these mini stories is your ability to steer them. Your action, or sometimes inaction, will change the way that these plots unfold. After I finished my first playthrough of the game I was anxious to start all over and play in a whole new way.  Occasionally the game will break away into 'choose your own adventure book' style sequences. These sequences will require you to choose actions, frequently based on the type of character you play, in order to push the scene forward. Sometimes they are short scenes that have you jumping over a large gap, or longer sequences that require multiple inputs such as climbing a cliff while being pursued by enemies. These sequences were a great addition to the game that helped break up the standard action, I only wish there were more of them.  The game isn't only combat and dialogue however, you'll obviously also spend a lot of time exploring the games rich and detailed world. The game doesn't take place in one large open world but rather in a bunch of smaller zones connected by load screens. Each self contained zone is dense with people, both friend and foe, that you can interact with. One zone in particular that you'll stumble across early on is your stronghold. The stronghold is a base-building side quest you can do for some small bonuses. The lore of the stronghold was compelling as you learn more about its previous owner and delve deeper into the labyrinth that exists underneath it, but unfortunately the same can't be said for the gameplay. It's a Farmville style upgrading system where you pump resources into your base and wait in-game days for the next upgrade to be pursued. Thankfully the bonuses you get from doing the stronghold are minor, so it can easily be ignored while you pursue other quests.  The visual and sound design are magnificent. Hand painted backgrounds are a joy to walk through and the music feels like it would be right at home as the background to Lord of the Rings. Unfortunately, character models clash with the rest of the games aesthetic and appear far older than the world their contained in.  Despite my qualms with its clunky combat, Pillars of Eternity was an amazing role playing experience with a fantastic world and equally fantastic characters. It's an easy recommendation to anyone who enjoys the CRPG style of game. The future is bright for Obsidian's own IP and I can't wait to see what they have in store for us next.",

Play this on Easy, or not at all.  90% of combat is keeping the party in formation, so the enemies don't run past the tanks, and no one gets gibbed. That's it. Your 'choices' are to initiate combat perfectly to get a good formation, and then pause constantly to keep it together. That's  all , and it's not even challenging. When your party formation breaks, it's because you grew too bored to pause often enough, and risked that it might happen. Zzzzzzzzzzzzz.  The art is a triumph. To capture the style of classic isometric games, in modern 3d rendering at high resolution, is something you have to see to believe.  The story is  only  passable. There's a lot of 'anti-fantasy' by jaded writers who no longer enjoy the genre. They hate wizards, so they add guns. They hate gods, so they killed one with a bomb. (Not a spoiler; it's backstory.) There's more grimdark and gothic horror than epic fantasy. Why is it so hard for amateur -- er, 'indie' -- artists to  appreciate  a popular style and stick to it? Perhaps games have publishers for a reason.",

            "review_text": "Old school, good times! Lots of choices in this game, the character development is probably my favorite part. Usually you have 4 approaches to situations instead of the usual two (good/evil).   There is a lot of reading, there's excellent voice acting, too, but most of the story unfolds through text. You'll be talking to a lot of NPCs and to your teammates along the way, much like Mass Effect, to find out their backgrounds and sometimes what they think about the situation at hand.  The environments are pretty standard fantasy: castle towns, woods, dungeons, caves, but everything seems to have a history and a place in the world, which gives me a Skyrim or WoW level of immersion. However it's more like a fantasy novel, your imagination does half of the work, there isn't much on-screen but the world feels deep.  It's not an easy game, this isn't Diablo, it's like WoW if you controlled a full party all by yourself. You have to manage 6 group members: tank, dps, healing &amp; buffs. Pause to give commands, unpause to watch the action, then pause again to adjust strategy. It can feel slow and difficult, but not painful like Dark Souls. Every fight can pose a challenge, but once you get a full party of 6 you have lots of abilities (maybe too many, I think the priest has about 20-30 spells, split into levels of power, each doing something specific like increasing resist to fear, for example).   I run with 2 tanks, 1 priest, 1 wizard, and 2 buff/ranged support. You'll find what works for you and you stick with it! Personally I open with a volley of ranged fire if possible, buff the party, make sure my tanks are in position to intercept, cast AOE in front of the tanks, and then try keep the dangerous enemies knocked over for as much of the fight as possible.",

            "review_text": "Well, hello... I grew up playing BioWare's fantastic RPG titles... Baldur's Gate was my favourite game for a very long time.  --- Might contain mild spoilers ---  Now, for Pillars of Eternity... It is a nice game with quite a few problems, so I'll try to summarize my whole experience...  When I started playing it, aside from strong feeling of nostalgia I was stunned by beautiful background graphics (characters are pretty low quality for today's standards, but they do the job)... Interface design is also fantastic... Anyway, I was immersed in game, story was interesting, depressive town of Gilded Vale was... well, depressing, and I really felt that... I started doing all the quests (as I normally do), and enjoyed it...  That changed, and after some time the whole game became a kind of chore... I wasn't as immersed as at the beginning, I stopped caring for characters... i.e. I really cared of Calisca and her sister and I generally liked stories of characters in Gilded Vale... After that, I didn't feel that vibe... I probably don't have enough time (as I had 10-15 years ago) to be immersed in the game for that long, but I played Witcher 3 for about 120 hours, and enjoyed every second of it...  Od Nua is interesting idea, but I didn't find it to be very important... Endless Paths are just to Hack-n-Slashy for this type of game (and combat), I didn't like it... And that is another problem of this game; It is full of uninteresting and unimportant combat. Some encounters are very easy, and have no point both storywise and for gameplay, but are there to build up playing hours, and then some of them are so hard that it is impossible to complete them (ie when you enter the last fight location, you won't be able to go back and build up your levels, and the last combat is really, really hard... it's ridiculous).  Talking about combat, I didn't find special abilities to be special at all... Aside from healing and summoning spells... Damage spells are ok, but you can't use them too often...  I really liked other adventurers, and their personalities... Side quests are hit and miss... The main quest starts really strong, but ends up being... well, not as good as the beginning...  'Reading' souls can be frustrating from time to time... It is often written in some kind of riddles or in strange sentences, that I needed a lot of effort to understand them... Or I just don't have as much patience... It has it's strengths; it shows that it is not so easy to read souls, and shows the chaos that is building up in his head, but it was just too hard, sometimes... Of course, for native English speaker, this is probably not a problem...  Another problem is tied to travel times... Not so important, generally, but it really damage up immersion... When travelling from location to location that are one next to the other you'll need i.e. 4 (or more) hours... That is not a problem as it is (those to locations might be that far away)... But then, in one instance, you'll actually enter underground tunnel in one location and exit it in another... In about 2 minutes, when not fighting... As I said, not so important, but hurts the immersion...  When I speak about locations, it is hard not to talk about loading screens that take too much time... Every little house that you want to enter in game, will take tenish seconds of your time to load... And for you to realise there is nothing in there... And now back, loading the location where you are...  ------------------------------------------  Verdict: Although I wrote many problems about Pillars of Eternity, I think it is a nice game... A lot of these problems that I have now are probably tied to my subjective opinion, and the fact that I don't have as much time as I had when I played Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, etc... Then, again, I liked some parts, mostly because of nostalgia, but we're all very subjective xD  Anyway, my final rating would be... 6.5/10",

At its full price you may want to do a bit of research before paying £35 as this style wont be for everyone, the game is challenging especially if you're new to the genre.  Updated: I never managed to bring myself to finish PoE, I believe this is because while I did enjoy the graphics, combat and elements of the main story, I felt the world building left a lot to be desired. The problem being that despite having played similar games with PoE I could never truly get into the lore or gain an understanding of the overall world because it simply didn't hold my interest and at times felt a tad like generic fantasy. Plus the NPC's and gravestones created by the contributors to the kickstarter are just plain horrible, rarely holding useful infomation and often breaking my immersion, its always dissapointing to see an interesting looking character and find out its another of these contributor made NPC's.

I like the old Baulders gate where your companions where unique, but here they are all the same. Sadness.  Lack of good side quests. No ability to find stuff on the map. You can get quests which take HOURS and HOURS to complete simply because you didn't talk to the right people in the right order. So annoying. This makes the game longer but not in a good way.  Bugs. Lots of bugs. At least when I played, I found several bugs such as the infinite fireball, that loaded back in when I came back to my keep.

From it's beautiful rich environments, great story line, and intriguing companions, the game brings you into a great new world to immerse yourself in. Some small game mechanics are still a bit wonky (pathing for your companion AI is one) but it barely bothered me. The new system with Endurance vs. Health was strange but refreshing and by the end I actually loved the idea of it. One of the biggest problems I had in BG series was the need to rest everytime I had my wizards use their spells, however in POE that wasn't an issue at all. The same problem applied for health in BG but again, in POE with the Endurance vs Health system it drastically cut the need for me to be resting all the time to replenish 'health'.  Another part of the game I loved was the different routes of personality you could take in this game. The many different options to reply ingame allowed for multiple ways situations could play out. Also if you didn't care for any of the ingame companions AT ALL you could hire/creat your OWN PARTY. I don't know why you'd want to do that  though...Eder/Aloth/Durance  for life.",

Taking the core gameplay style of the original Baldur's Gate, combining it with the storytelling of Planescape Torment and creating a whole new world with new character classes, skills, magic, and abilities.

One of the great features of the game is the way that skills, character class, race, past choice in conversations etc. all give you different options in conversation with NPCs and especially in scripted moments. Being without a particular skill is never game breaking but they can give you an edge when exploring, dealing with a villain or looking for loot. The game itself is huge with lots to do, many side quests and enormous replayability with the way that the main story unfolds. It incorporates morality, the nature of religion, good vs. evil and the player character in a closely interwoven development that has you almost wanting to skip the side quests just to findout what happens next.

While that may seem like trivial semantics, the sense of involvement it creates for me is phenominal.  Unlike other 'classic' RPGS like Baldurs Gate and Wasteland 2, that special sense of attatchment you feel to the first character you roll up doesn't get taken away by an overbearing story you are being told. Nor is your party just a bunch of different stats you chose to make up for the weaknesses of other party members. Like a true session of table top role playing, you are given a situation and asked to participate. Just keep in mind you aren't participating alone, despite this being a single player game.  If you are a fan of interesting stories and characters, consequential decision making outside the good and evil spectrum, and RPGs in general, this game is for you.  If you enjoyed The Witcher, Neverwinter Nights/NWN 2, Starwars: Knights of the Old Republic, or Dragon Age: Origins, you will enjoy this.",

This is like Baldur's Gate 3 with enhanced visuals and game mechanics to make it smooth and fun to play on modern systems.  The game is challenging, but it gives you multiple ways to complete your objectives.  What changed from Baldur's Gate 2: + 3D models + The stat system has been reworked (It got better) + There are multiple ways to complete your objectives while still keeping the game challenging (more immersive, better) + It's slightly harder. (I've only played the game on hard difficulty) (I like it)  An ogre for example looks more dangerous and hits harder too. + Classes and skills have been completely reworked to make every class viable. This is a huge difference and major improvement. The bard for example used to be a silly character running around playing his harp in battles. The chanter from pillars of eternity on the other hand is totally badass.  Obsidian has succeeded in making a game that gives you that same awesome look and feel you had when you were playing Baldur's Gate 2 on release day, and made it possible to enjoy this on modern machines with modern mindsets.  The only negative point I can think of in this game is that at some point in the future I will finish it, which is sad because I want this experience to last.   I've read some negative reviews to see what people could have issues with. I'll comment on some of them based on my experience (Check my playtime) Here are their gripes:   - Game is bugged.   -&gt; I have only encountered 1 bug, The game completely crashed once.   Starting it back up I was able to replicate the issue, but it was easy to get around.   For a game that has just launched it could be a lot worse IMO  - I'm stuck and had to go hire some toon to get my mechanics up  -&gt; The developer had apparently anticipated this problem and   they have actually implemented multiple ways to complete objectives.   This problem does not exist in the game in my experience.  Use your head and think of other ways. The game challenges you.  - The combat is slow and it sucks  -&gt; It's not an action RPG. If you have never played a game like Baldur's Gate, I suggest perhaps watching a tutorial video, but it really isn't that hard.    That's it for my review.

I got it for 25$ and am satisfied with the purchase,but considering the Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate are available for even less makes it a tough call overall.  Still,if you already played those and are looking for more-or just want something more modern-Pillars of Eternity does have enough going for itself to make it a worthwile purchase and an interesting experience to play through, especially considering isometric RPGs are not that common these days (even though we're enjoying a resurgence with other good titles like Shadowrun and Wasteland 2).

Sure, there are minor gripes, like the world and loot being a bit overly high magic, Constitution attribute being pretty meaningless, same attributes across all classes, depending only whether their role is dps or tanking. But it's still a far better system then in 95% crpgs out there. Every class gets new exciting abilities every level. And what it important, the system is also incredibly fun. Oh and while the stronghold is gorgeous and includes many nice upgrades, it is otherwise a bit bare-bones, virtual. Quests are purely virtual, you assign an NPC and wait for the end, with apparently only 1 possible outcome. Some quests which would improve the area security or extend your influence would be great. You can't interact with guests. Regardless of the multiple defences, walls, mazes built and guards hired, the invasions are extremly simplistic and always happen in the same place, already inside the keep.

Not too bad, but ... 2. it does not take place in any recognizable world that we have known in the past. ALSO NOT really bad, just makes it hard to get used to a new world where you have to learn everything from scratch. 3. You cannot name your saves (maybe they might fix this in a future patch?) 4. Party AI seems missing? There is NO option to choose what they are programmed to do by default in any given encounter. BUT FORMATION / marching order IS present. That's all you get. :( 5. NUMBER of Inventory slots per PC are WAY TOO FEW! (they should be at least TWICE as many from what they give, in my opinion) 6. Resting is now called 'camping' and YOU MUST HAVE SUPPLIES to do it (no 'roughing it') or else you will be fatigued indefinitely until you find an inn (better stock up!) 7. Priest (aka 'Cleric', my erstwhile favorite class!) SEEMS SUPER WEAK from the character builder, but then again i have not played that class yet... because of that reason. I chose a Cipher (aka a psionic type, similar to a soul knife) instead). This weakness is totally opposite of D&amp;D 3.x where the Cleric is a Tier-1 top class, which i was used to. 8. in character builder you CANNOT ZOOM IN to see if your appearance customization choices are what you want or not (you really have to SQUINT or get a magnifying lens to be sure of what you pick) -- I DO NOT LIKE THIS AT ALL. 9. There are hardly ANY customization choices for one's appearance BESIDES HAIR. THIS is 2015 and we have ONLY THREE CHOICES for a female elf head / face? And maybe ONLY 9-10 choices for tones / color for clothing and skin, etc... WERE YOU ONLY aiming for the nostalgic angle and NOT BOTHERING to reach further or even TOP those 'glory days' of 2002? MAJOR FAIL here, Obsidian!!  10. I would have liked more than 10-12 first-level spells to pick from. I am fine with the # i start out with and progression does not seem bad so far (I really cannot comment much on progression since i am still barely starting to play and have only gotten mid-way into level 2 lol) BUT FROM THE CHARACTER BUILDER this TINY selection of spells to pick from (NOT JUST for Cypher but i looked at all other classes too) was VERY SPARSE! TRIPLE the selection availability, and i will be happier. 11. There is no true 3D world-tilt like in Neverwinter Nights 1 and 2. IT IS just simply NOT HERE. Do not expect there to be one. The most you get is a decent amount of panning, and SMALL bit of mouse-wheel zoom. 12. Traveling from 1 map to the other is much more like a cross between Icewind Dale 1/2 and Temple of Elemental Evil with the icons on the side of the screen to indicate a portal jump option from 1 region to the other via use of an Area Map. MY FIRST HOUR was beset by me thinking 'I'm stuck' when i could not find a way out of the 2nd map screen after a cave i had finished ... then i noticed the icon edging it's way around the side of the screen and clicked on it ... WHEW! I was not stuck anymore. THIS DETAIL about how to 'get around' in the game does not seem to be advertised and it seems to be just 'Expected' for past players of IWD 1/2 and BG 1/2 to just presume that is the way things are done. OLD SCHOOL PLAYERS will not have a problem with this - they're used to that. But people who have never played those KIND of CRPG games before (admittedly, most of the audience for this game that has been anticipating it's build and release for years now... are NOT NEW to this UI style) will not likely find it easy to figure out how to progress. 13. NO MULTIPLE CHARACTER CREATION -- AT ALL. You get 1 character to create (at first) and then you are stuck with it throughout the rest of the game. YOU MIGHT get more of your own creation later on in the game but i honestly have not gotten far enough to see if it works like that yet (Temple of Elemental Evil allowed you to create or add / remove new PCs of your own design, or pre-gen NPCs, using a book at a bar counter at an Inn. THIS GAME MIGHT HAVE THAT - but so far, you CANNOT DO THIS when you first start the game. You CAN add 5 other NPCs to your party, eventually, but you SHOULD be able to make your own party RIGHT AWAY. However this game (probably and most likely due to plot points of the story) does not allow that at game start. 14. Graphics custom choices are NEARLY NON-EXISTENT beyond resolution and frequency (hertz). You CANNOT fine-tune any advanced options like Bloom or Anti-aliasing or any of the other typical stuff. It's very set in it's ways. 15. I CANNOT TELL if this game was made for any sound system / speaker setup beyond just stereo? (may be my own problem) 16. There were a few FREEZES and HANGS with LATENCY in this game at certain points when i started out or when i changed map screens but so far NO crashes yet (and i pre-ordered and pre-loaded the install on the VERY SAME release day (today) so i got first edition. THIS HOPEFULLY will be fixed in later patches? There DO seem to be some memory or bus issues with the way this game moves data around. I have an 8 GB RAM Athlon 8-core FX 8120 ... this game BARELY uses 2 gigs of my RAM. I have 4 gigs FREE RIGHT NOW with the game PAUSED AS i write this review. so memory usage is NOT AT ALL a bad consideration. There may just be some weird timing or race condition issues which should see some ironing-out later on ... this is typical in lots of new releases). 17. Combat can be as fast or as slow as you want it (see PRO point 3 below) BUT there are NO CLEAR INDICATIONS as to whenever you MOVE in-combat ... if it will draw any attacks of opprtunity (like D&amp;D had) -- OR, are those what the game calls 'interrupts'? USUALLY SPELLS do those things, or tactical options. A NICE BREAK DOWN of their rule system would be very nice to examine BEFORE playing this game, so i know what to do, what not to do, and when to do or not do either of them. 18. Abilty point spread at character creation does seem a tad thin. I evened my scores out to be an average of 14 across the board, as a level 1 Cipher (aka like a soul-knife), but even then, the POINT-BUY system this game uses is not really generous. CHOOSE WISELY.  PROS - things i LIKE about this game so far:  1. it's basically an entire new engine built around the same exact TYPE of experience once can expect from older past generation of CRPGs like Baldur's Gate 1, 2, Icewind Dale 1, 2, and PlaneScape:Torment... etc etc. MANY people have already belabored these points enough, so this is just me being 'captain obvious'. The scripting is smooth, the voice-acting is more than i expected (some places still lack it) 2. the GRAPHICS (for this kind of game, anyway -- since you really cannot compare THIS genre to other games beyond those of it's LEGACY history) are THE BEST compared TO those past games (see PRO point 1 above) 3. Auto-pause IN combat is BUILT like a PERFORMANCE HOT ROD. NOBODY can complain with the number of options given there.  NEUTRAL POINT:   Combat in this game is much more like AD&amp;D 1st / 2nd edition in that THERE IS NO SCALE for what one may call 'Challenge Rating' like TES 4 Oblivion did (matching your level with an appropriate encounter no matter where you may roam - NO, THIS GAME makes you need to RUN from some fights if you end up not evenly matched to an enemy. THIS IN ITSELF IS NOT REALLY a bad thing, but it IS a CAVEAT for those entering this game thinking that they can just take on anything that their level seems 'fit' for - YOU WILL DIE FAST if you come into this game thinking that way. YOU WILL NEED to be careful because REAL DEATH is everywhere. Some of the best advice i can give to people new to this game is CHOOSE YOUR BATTLES CAREFULLY!",

It has everything a perfect RPG might need. Deep, interesting world, great visuals, awesome music, truly living npcs with their own backgrounds.   I am really amazed by the hit system. No more binary hit/miss with flat 5% crit chance. The mechanics built for attack rolls and miss/graze/hit/crit is really awesome. And the best thing is, it works the same on every aspect. Exactly the same formulas work for swinging a sword and casting a spell.   I am playing a paladin and I am really happy that for the first time paladins aren't just uber-good warriors in shining armors. You can select from multiple ways of life, you can be a cruel/aggresive paladin, honest/diplomatic, rational/stoic and more. There is no trivial good-evil axis. There are many dispositions, many possibilities of action.  It is like taking all that is best in Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape: Torment and improving it 300% so that it matches the expectations of today's gamers.  I am harsh when it comes to rating games, but Pillars of Eternity is peremptorily 10/10.",

On the one hand there was, of course nostalgia, on the other the game simply oozes the designers' lifeblood. You can feel it in all the little details and every line of text, from the dialogue to the virtual novel style elements. This is not a 'medal for effort', though. Only a game that shows that the developers cared - really cared - can hope to be good, or even great game and lately too many games are released that show quite the opposite.  All in all PoE is worth playing; be it out of nostalgia, the love of role playing games or the respect for devs who actually care! However this is game is not the holy grail some people claim: it's nostalgia, first an foremost! If you loved Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale and Planescape Torment you probably will feel right a t home in PoE. If you have never played one of those, chances are that you might find PoE not THAT fun and entertaining, especially if you are mostly used to RPGs that have been realeased in the last 5 years.

They will just sit their even when combat starts until given an order and sometimes their orders get lost so they just stand there again. I'm playing on a harder difficulty so I constantly pause to micromanage but for the trash fights it can get a little tedious. The second is the seemingly random voice acting. Sometimes a response will be voice acted but the next in the same conversation wont be and then suddenly the last is. It's a small thing but takes me out of the game a bit when it happens.

Ill tell you what is wrong with the game.  Roleplay options, - the core stats are a joke. Intelligence recommended for a barbarian, Might not recommended for monk, intelligence on wizard is only good for debuffing and 'dialog'. There are no special changes while having stat a minimum - 3 int talking like normal, 3 dex having no problems swinging 2 swords etc. The system is extremely flawed and its a huge letdown when you make some conceptual hero, take appropriate skills and then they are almost never checked outside prologue.   In the entirety of Act 1 i havent seen a single Survival/Stealth/Mechanic/Athletics*past prologue* checked in dialog or events, no finding hidden ♥♥♥♥ doesnt count. And it stinks. The game presents itself as hardcore old school RPG which it certainly is if you think ♥♥♥♥ graphics, extremely horrible party AI, massive pathing problems equals old school. The same 'roleplay' problem is felt all over - say i killed Roedric and come back to Calisa's sister she is still panicking oh no we'lll get hanged mode. Maxed out reputation with people in the village, the dialog doesnt change with anyone outside random ♥♥♥♥ villagers say. Really? This is supposed to be a top tier rpg.   I liked how the quests adapted to what you do, like instead of doing the 'make water to brew' you instead murder everyone, that was good and it was a step in the right direction, but it ultimately didnt matter one bit how you went through prologue. The outcome is always the same, same with almost everything you do. They dont change anything on macro level. Say after the other watcher dies there are 3 options to do with his soul, giving roleplay opportunity but they are the same as an outcome... Why even have it then? To show off what it could have been? Dissapointing.  The Stronghold felt exciting, yet it feels so dead and depressing when i show up, the events are not fun, they are terrirble, instead of inviting over opressed peasants to provide them heaven or w/e im visited by some duke who i cant even go have a talk with. It could have been a great addition, but it feels superficial and obsolete since the moment you get it and all through the game.   You guys talk about creative freedom for the game, yet the achievements are the most uninspired garbage ever. Kill these many or dont kill as many! Finish the game on highest difficulty and prove you are the TRUE TRYHARD or that you can make a fire godlike monk and play fine with it. Whoever was in charge of achievements - let someone else do this, you are ill suited for the task. They feel tackled on, a 'modern burdern' which they had to make for the check mark at the game launch. For someone not constricted by publishers or backers hurrying you up that was really ♥♥♥♥in bad. Dont want people to spoil story for themselves? Make them hidden or whatnot, make them fun!   Technical issues with this game are few...but extremely irritating and game breaking including, removal of passives on doubleclick, having your people stuck somewhere with no option to get them out including: ladders with spaces below them, treelines post scripted dialog. Game glitching out hard in dialogs if launched for extended period of time...and these are just the ones i saw, i struggle to grasp how many total there are.   Realism: a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ village with about 100-200 people in it sustaining a huge ♥♥♥ castle fit for a king with more guards then villagers. And other incredible ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like that all over the game.   And thats all just Act 1. Almost a week past the release there is no patch. Obsidian, you can do better then that.   Overall though its still a fantastic game and possible THE RPG of 2015, but it could have been so much more. I give it 8,5/10 Right now and 9.5 when issues are resolved *at least the gameplay wise, i dont expect anyone to figure out a way to fix flawed quest design. ",

The fact that it is no longer based on the D&amp;D system was a concern of mine, but the new system works brilliantly. The classes, leveling and talents are solid and fairly easy to understand. Giving up on certain classic D&amp;D rules is a good idea in my opinion. Now you can have your Cleric wield a crossbow, making it a deadly sniper from the back. However, the lack of specialization classes is a flaw IMHO. Also the lack of Party AI (behavior) is a really silly. A lot of micromanagement needed at times.  Graphics are very solid, beautiful, yet paying homage to the original games. 3D characters look very good an blend seamlessly into the background. Sounds are also good and the music made me think of old Baldur's immideately. The game feels sublime and finished, and there seems to be very few bugs to encounter.  However, the story seems a bit vague compared to the original Bioware games and characters lack charisma. They are not as interesting as say Minsc or Edwin, but still are interesting enough to keep you company.  All in all, I am giving this game a strict 8/10. If the party AI is added I would raise it to 9/10.   There is plenty of content, but I do hope there will be a substantial amount of extra content in DLC-form in the future.  ",

If you have ever played the Baldurs Gate and Icewind Dale series of videogames set in the Forgotten Realms setting, or Planescape: Torment in the Planescape Setting then playing Pillars of Eternity is like coming home after a long journey.  To be sure, there are differences such as 3D character models , a different setting and so on. Yet the game has the same timeless quality about it. One of the things the older games lacked was a real impact made by the background/ biography of the character you create, not so here. If you are of a particular faith or hail from a certain region then you can access dialogue and object interaction that can have a variety of effects on the game. And there are other factors as well beyond those two.  Obsidian proved last year that they can make a blockbuster of a game with South Park: The Stick of Truth and Pillars of Eternity is no less spectacular. Unless you abhor games where choices have consequences and loathe a good storyline this is THE GAME to get. There are a few minor issues of course, but those were present in earlier AD&amp;D games as well.  Pro's: -Deep storyline, with choices effecting real consequences =Beautiful environments -Unique and deep characters -Fitting, lovingly composed music -The ability to 'recruit' more customly made characters -Non-violent solutions possible -Lots of text to read -Pets  Cons: -Some quests lack alternative resolutions -More party members with dialogue would have been nice, essentially now you need to reserve a slot for a utility member or two. -Custom party members have no dialogue, quests or whatever. -No miniature giant spacehamster pets -Nothing to do with backer made npc's but read a really short bit of story. -Idem dito for the tombstones with backers on them. -Some content feels cut short  In conclusion, the game is a wonderful experience despite its flaws. One would shudder to think the possibilities if Minsc and Boo had been implemented though. It is my hope that a sequal or game in the same vein will be made.",

If you like CRPGs you'll love this game. If you haven't played a CRPG before, Pillars is a good one to get your feet wet on.

On par if not better than Dragon Age. +Good storyline, good setting background. Your introduction to it can be kind of head spinning, but there's enough reminders to keep you on track. +Lots to do and see. There are tons of quests to keep you busy, and the locations are diverse. +UI is clean, effective, and intuitive. +Combat is very complex, which means there are a lot of approaches you can take to building your party the way you want. +Generally bug free. I only ran into a few minor issues, and most of those have been immediately addressed by the developer's recent patch. Game is also very stable. I alt-tab out constantly and have never had it crash on me. +NPCs you can play with have very distinct backgrounds, and are all very interesting. I love NPCs that I can relate to. They add a lot to the game.  Cons -Item bonuses and enchanting generally is pretty boring. Flat bonuses that just make you better. The items you FIND are interesting, but the stuff that you can add is very bland. -The endurance/heatlh system just seems wierd to me. Generally your characters just get knocked out, but sometimes they die. How much damage blows through from endurance to health is not intuitive at all. -Money becomes kind of worthless towards the middle of the game. The game lacks any 'super high priced, super high quality' vendors that would allow you to save up and spend your cash. -Could use a few more NPCs. Not every class is represented as an NPC, which means you need to make custom characters if you want access to certain classes in your party.",

It's story is a save yourself story like the one in Mask of the Betrayer expansion of Neverwinter Nights 2. I might've been fine with it - if Obsidian hadn't already told this story once. The story also loses significance and meaning since you're doing it out of self-interest and the game becomes very meta with the game pretty much saying: 'Well you gotta save your own skin. Do you wanna play or not?' This kinda storytelling is obviously transparent and generally very non-interesting from a writing standpoint or as a means to roleplay your character since you're locked into seeing the antagonist as an antagonist much unlike Saren from BioWare's Mass Effect 1. They put so much effort of putting 'backgrounds' and 'dispositions' in the game - but they really don't make much use out of these tools throughout the game.  Mechanically the game *could have* been interesting if it wasn't for the fact that Obsidian has a weird way of understanding difficulty shift: Normally in both video and tabletop RPGs; the difficulty scales from being easy to being more and more difficult over time. However in Pillars of Eternity this happens instantly - so much so that unless you're a good mixmaxing RPG munchkin; you're probably going to be overwhelmed easily throughout the game. This is also becomes much more difficult because you can't rely on previous experience from the d20 system since this game uses the d100 system. This makes your understanding of good builds in previous iterations of this genre pretty much useless and makes the minmaxing experience worse as well unless you're willing to learn this custom d100 system.  This way to balancing makes the game test you more as a player and your skills and less about your character and what skills it has. There is a reason why feats and magics in many tabletops are very powerful for example and that is because they're supposed to be meaningful in the context of the game. Generally a good RPG assumes that you limit yourself to enjoy roleplaying, of course this cannot be done all the time in video games and it might not even be suitable here - but balancing away from characters and more on top of minmaxing certainly shuts a large portion of players out from enjoying the game. Me included.  So no I don't recommend this game. I think it's a poor attempt of Obsidian, especially since they're normally very good at making good writing at least. Guess people like me has to stick to traditional tabletop. :P",

I'm used to a lot of RPGs that throw in a lot of random side quests and do not keep the flow/immersion like PoE. The character development is good in that you are able to customise the ability and skill progression for each character.  You meet npcs that can join your party as you go on in the game, this is good and bad. The good part is that these npcs open up new quests for you to follow. The bad part is that if you have a full party then you need to drop one of your other characters for the npc. Since some quests take a bit of time to complete, you can have multiple npcs hanging out in the party while your other characters stay benched. At the moment I have 3 npcs in my party of 6. It would be good if you could still do the npc quests without having to have them disrupt your perfect party composition :)  I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone that likes adventure RPGs, well worth it.",

I tried Icewind Dale and my party got slaughtered almost immediately... so I was kinda 'eh' on the genre until I saw Angry Joe's review of it.  My friend had it on his Steam account and our accounts are linked so one night I decided to give it a shot... and as I was finishing up the first act I said aloud 'Son of a ♥♥♥♥♥! When did the sun come up?!'.  This game has made me totally rethink those old style RPGs that I did so poorly with and has even made me want to go back and give them another try. Given how stubborn I am when I make up my mind on something that speaks volumes about the game.  What I liked: - The option to fully customize your team with several choices for race, nationality, class, and more. - A very useful crafting system that allows you to make consumable items like potions, scrolls, and so on. Early on you might be better served to sell most potion ingredients (especially if you're going with a custom party as recruiting party members at inns can get expensive), but by the endgame you'll be getting a LOT of use out of this. - A rich and detailed story set in a fantasy world that is guaranteed to draw a fantasy junkie in. I'm a huge fan of fantasy novels (special fondness for contemporary fantasy, but I like traditional fantasy too) and the huge amount of dialogue and story behind various characters around the world was something I really loved. - If you don't want to create your own custom party there are adventurers who will join you scattered across the world including a large gun-wielding chanter, an insane priest, a psychic cipher girl who seems to have lost her memory, a dwarven ranger searching for the reincarnation of someone from her tribe, and more. All these characters have fully fleshed out backstories that tie into quests for them, voice actors, and some really funny dialogue bits (I love watching Aloth and his 'alternate personality' going at it). In addition, they've added three new characters to recruit in the White March expansion set; a rather masochistic monk, a soul-infused golem of a rogue, and a gigantic barbarian woman. - During play you'll get your own upgradeable stronghold that becomes your base of operations. It really adds a lot to the game and sits atop one of the main dungeons as well. - POST WHITE MARCH DLC: They've added A.I. options for your teammates which, while they can be really annoying at first, are extremely useful. Just don't make the mistake I did and set all your guys to aggressive or else you'll find out just how suicidal Durance really is.  What I didn't like: - Traps in dungeons can be a bit tricky to spot and can easily take down your party if you're not careful (sneak EVERYWHERE and keep someone with a high Mechanics score). - While the party members who you find along the way can sometimes get involved in storylines, your custom made ones cannot. One quest required a cipher (either you or this girl you meet in town) in your party to get the good ending but even though I had one on my team she couldn't do what was needed because she was a custom one. - Some of the fights can be downright punishing. The final boss of the Endless Paths of Od Nua is a stupidly difficult fight if you decide to go that route (you don't have to fight them, but that's all I'll say about that) and don't even try going up against the end boss unless your team is level 12 minimum. Mind you, if you LIKE that sort of difficulty...",

            "review_text": "Summary: Best RPG I've played since Divinity Original Sin, which in turn was the best I've played since the original Dungeon Siege.   Pros:  1) The depth of content offered by this game is fantastic. A rich world providing lots of distractions and things to keep you occupied, and a healthy main quest if you want to simply run through from start to finish.  2) Near perfect character customisation. From your main character to your custom followers the level detail you are able to go into really satisfies my autism. The only change I would make is not having character alignments being bound to the class, so I could choose for example to be an evil or benevolent Gold Pact Paladin. Others may disagree.  3) Great visuals. While people shouldn't really be playing these games for the visuals, having good looking scenery, lighting and spell effects really adds to the overall immersion provided by the game.   4) Companions. A good selection of companions to choose from - minus the ones you can create yourself - each with a back story and companion quests add to the overall, rpg-ness of the game. All of them do however come across rather likable in their own way which is bit of a downside, I would like an unlikable companion that just pisses everyone off to make the party a bit more spicey.   Good but could be improved:   1) Combat. The real time combat in this game is generally very good and with the difficulty turned up can be really challenging, but at times it can also be rather repetitive. When crawling through the ruins of Cad Nua for instance, there are A LOT of encounters and as a result they become rather formulaic, performing the same rotations and when one encounter doesn't go as planned, reload and repeat. This will probably not be an issue for a lot of people but it is something to be mindful of.   2) Interactions. Character and NPC interations are very good and provide a good choice of options. Most of the time. I would like further interactions based on character and party alignment / reputation. People are scared if your evil, children are scared if your a priest, etc.   Cons:   Music. The music in a game like this could really enhance the mood, however I found it rather lacking and repetitive, and at times there was nothing playing at all where it really could have made a difference. A minor criticism but one that really impacts the mood and feel of the game. Imagine watching LoTR without the music.",

I found it to be very linear as well.

I have been playing video games since pong and have played every major and not so major rpg that has ever been made. This one is not a stand out. I was so excited about this game after Divinity, hoping for another kickstarter slam dunk and found myself left wanting.

In fact I agree with most positive reviews about the game. I always liked RPG , Dungeon Dragons , Board Rpg and that's no different so you can say I'm fan in this kinds of game   So, why the negative Review then?    JUST TOO MANY LOADING SCREENS and can't disable autosave option    My pc is not that bad and take way less than 30 sec for the game proceeds . But the game just dies for me . It takes all the fluidity about the game . Here let me give an example:  Travel (Defiance Bay (Brackenbury District )) -&gt; Load(wait 20sec) -&gt; Go to the Inn -&gt; Load (Wait 15sec) -&gt;Explore the Inn after that go upstairs to loot or do some quest -&gt;Load (wait more 10sec) .. After you explore . time to leave . Repeat process of waiting . TOTAL = (20+15+10) . 2 = 1 min 30 sec . [This a approach, mostly times]  Now think this math for the WHOLE game . IT'S ANNOYING . I stop doing sidequest and sometimes going to inns for rest because the load times.  You see, there is no problem for me to wait a Medium Map to load like a new region,city or dungeon . BUT wait everytime just to enter a pointless small building that doesn t even have nothing important is just bad.  Now about Autosaves ... : You like it , fine sure at least put some option to disable. I hate that stuff I prefer create my onlys save files with titles about what I am understanding about the game and I don t want some bunch trash save files named autosave everytime I load the game. I have a mod that fixes that. Although is not even working properly because the game got patched  In conclusion, I can't recommed something that makes me feel annoyed even if It's well made.So if you do want play the game, at least wait for sale for some fair purposes   So buy if it s for sale.   To be honest when i was playing i was already thinking what class would be my MC in the next playthough and what difficult (For achievements and challenge purposes..) But now..

            "review_text": "TL;DNR?  - Nicely presented - The depth of this game is the plot which didn't engage me. - The mechanics of play are very (very) simple and frustratingly lacking in the ability to do things you would do IRL if - confronted with the situations the game presents - You'll spend hours reading text off the screen. - Story ok in the telling - but cliched in the plot  My fault. I read a lot IRL so reading off a screen is never going to compete with a good book.  So...  After years of loving cRPG's PoE, which is a decent game, was the one that finally broke me. I had such a feeling of deja vu as I read the texts and listened to the dialogue. I guessed the plotline and most of the twists long before they were revealed. I felt constricted by the dialog choices that were often a choice between several options I would never consider taking and can't imagine anyone in their right mind would consider. Do you want to take; The terrible option The not so terrible option The barely adequate option  While never giving the often blindingly obvious best choice as an option. That and the story isn't really very good. It's ok, but aimed perhaps at teens and pretty cliched, Cliche? Well maybe. I suppose if you've not come across the tropes used in PoE dozens of times before, it might not be a cliche to you - to me it feels very tired and predictable but then I'm old and been playing RPG's since the original MUD in 1978  PoE isn't the worst for this. It's just the one when I finally had enough.  Since the times of my favourite cRPG's (BG1 and BG2) some games have come out with complex layered game mechanics and good AI that allow emergent gameplay and situations to occur. They rely on the players imagination as a story creator rather than what must actually be hundreds of thousands of pre-scripted words in a typical cRPG.  I much prefer those. Games like Dwarf Fortress adverture mode, Aurora, Cataclysm DDA where my imagination creates the story and the where, if the complex layered game mechanics say an action is possible - it's always possible regardless of consequence.   The gameplay itself is simple. There is little discovery in the game essp when compared to the ability to wander off in games as similar as the original Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate 2. There isn't much room to exercise your imagination as the game, while having choices, keeps you on rails tightly between these choices.  Just because a rail line has junctions it doesn't stop being a rail line.  That's what this is. A very text heavy rail journey with a sprinkling of a simple game on top.  If you prefer your fiction of the cliched type and your book reading to be off a screen with the odd bit of 'choose your adventure' and a sprinkiling of a simple game in there somewhere. Then PoE and these modern text heavy cRPG's are for you.   I never felt empathy for the character I played, or as if I really controlled ar influenced anything around me other than in the most superficial and temporary way.  I'm probably in a minority of cRPG players in that  I prefer to actually create, build and explore in an RPG, and this game doesn't allow the player to do very much of that.",

DISCLAIMER: I have not completed the game so this is subject to change but nothing I've seen has hinted this review will change.  Basically as follows for me:  -Amazing story with spectacular writing (seriously, some of the best I've ever seen in a game) -Amazing voice over talent (for the most part) -Unique character building system (normalized stats for all classes - EG Might increasing dmg in both fighters and mages) -Locations that are believeable -Amazingly diverse and interesting quests and characters. It brings you in and keeps you there.  -Through mechanics explained in the story, there are MANY outlets for additional story though the game. Back stories for characters that are down right amazing and just plain fun.   Only a few problems:  -SOME of the voice acted parts of the dialog will not be there. In other words, you'll be listening to a character speaking, once he completes you go to the next slide and there's no voice. After you read it, you click next and it's voice acted. This means that in one conversation, there are both voiced and non-voiced sections. This is the only part that can rip you (only slightly) out of the game. Nothing to get upset about but it's there none the less.  -Very few bugs. The ones that are there are generally known and being fixed (see 'double-click equip' bug)   People I would suggest this game for:   -Anyone who likes games like Dragon Age or Divinity: Original Sin. I say Dragon Age for those who played using the pause feature a lot (you will need to in Pillars of Eternity)  -People who like to think through things, not just be hand-held the whole way.  -ANYONE who is dying for a good story in a video game, at least try it. Even if the game play doesn't appeal to you completely.   People I say should MAYBE pass on it.   Reading. There's so much in this game it's basically like a book. So here's what I'll tell you...  Think about if reading is something, even if you don't enjoy it much, that you can get used to. If you think, maybe reading is something I can tolerate, even if it's not my favorite thing ever, then buy it.  If reading is something that you HATE doing. Do yourself a favor and pass on it. Not because the gamplay sucks but because you WILL miss a whole lot of the story. You'll also get stuck in many spots. Many times, the answers to puzzles are in books, notes, etc.   -----------------------------   Reading aside, there's nothing that I would say that should turn you away from buying this game.

I know that it looked similar to the baulder's gate that I played in the past, and if you have not played any of those titles then let me say it is a good thing to be compared to. Let me say after 10 hours of gameplay and some reading and experimenting with the class and gameplay this game is growing into a new favoirte, now let me tell you some of the reasons why:   First of I am a fantasy nerd, I read fantasy all the time, and when I am not reading series like 'Malazan book of the fallen' or 'Legacy of the Drow' then I am listening to audio books or playing games that delve into that genre. This game so far can be classified as fantasy rpg, and has a rich story so far that keeps me wanting to progress. The story in some areas is very original and in other's does what many other totl fantasy novels do. I would have to say as far as going off the story, the game is worth play thus far.   Some games that are good do one of a few things right well enough to keep people interested and playing till the end of the story, something like story rich, great gameplay, stunning graphics and soundtrack, etc. Well, I am happy to say that this title gets 3 of those 4 things I just mentioned, Story, which I mentioned up top, next is gameplay, and though this game is not completely originaly with it's mechanics but what it does it does very well. First impressions, for myself, were so-so and I decided that I hd to keep playing to get a better judge. I am glad I did the game play very fun once you decide on which function and role you want each member of your party to play in each battle, It is also important to know the character's in party stregnths and weaknesses so that you can pause in fight(yes you have the choice to pause in the game and set your characters up for which spell or ability they be doing next and to which enemy, or something like weapon change and or party buff when endurance is low. It is a nice feature that you do not see in many games. There is still things I am sure like different abilities and higher leveled skills that I have yet to learn which even improve on the gameplay.  So far, this game is kind of addicting I like the ability to get caught up in events in the npc's lives things that could definitely happen if this game was taking place irl, and have the end choice that has impact on not just your character but the lives and or well being of a town or individual npc is a really nice if not sometimes frustrating feature. I really do feel this game is a must try to those that like the more old school rpg's and enjoy fantasty, but I do not think only diehards would really enjoy this game. This game can be for any gamer that takes the time play past the tutorial.   As far as cons on this game I would most lilely say the worse things I have experienced in this game is probably the fact that I have not been able to rotate the camera(not sure if it is just something I have not set right) so that I can spin the camera 360 degrees and see better in some instances. The graphics are fine for this type of game but I do think they good of added some better textures. Other than these two things I have not had qualms with this game and have nothing but positive thoughts and hopes for it's progression, I hope others take a chance on this title because it is very much worth it.",

The game is a spiritual successor of Baldur's Gate/Icewind Dale/Planescape: Torment but it also improves most of the aspects, like graphic, sound, the combat system and the character customization. The main difference between those games and PoE is the fact that PoE is not a D&amp;D game and doesn't use any of the D&amp;D settings. I was a bit worried about this because D&amp;D 2nd edition is very rich and recreating something even similar requires a lot of time, but the PoE team surprised me: the game mechanics are good, sometime even better than old games. The strategy is dominant in every battle and the game is challenging even at lower difficulties. The non-linear progress of the game can be a pain for people used to games with linear progression, but the result is a realistic world in which you must be careful and wise.  Graphics and sound are amazing. In particular I find the soundtrack inspired and well placed.  If I have to find a problem in the game, probably I would point out that the story is not completely original; sometimes it resemble a certain game about past lives...but honestly that could be considered a feature of the game, considering that the other game is another masterpiece.  I recommend this game but not to everybody: the game is challenging, story-driven and sometimes slow, e.g. when reading dialogs. You have to like this kind of games to love this game.",

My review of this game is below.  The isometric game and its designs are wonderful. The story is rich, and the pre-defined script still makes it feel like your choices alter the course of the game. The NPC's that came from the backers are completely not part of the world and its story, but it does help emerge yourself into the world that you are in. They are not all happy fun stories. Some are very dark, some are neutral, and some are very bright. I got tired of them initially, until I realized that I enjoyed reading their stories because it made me feel like I understood the world that was created for us better.  Some people might complain about the XP system, how you can kill 100 people and not gain any XP until you encounter new creatures or complete quests. I hated it first as well. But before I knew it, after exploring everything, i was a much higher level than I thought I was. I couldn't really anticipate when I leveled but when I did level, it was a gratifying experience. I couldn't wait to hit NEXT to see if i got a new talent, or what new higher level spells my wizard could cast, or my priest could pray for.   The only problem I had, was that I didn't get to create a full party that I wanted (as I wanted to listen to all of the pre-generated PC's talk.) Yes, I can create whatever members I wanted, but if I knew what classes I was going to pick up first, I would have chosen a different main character class to start with as some of the other classes just sound awesome. That just means i'll have to wait for playthrough #2, and maybe #3 to experience the interaction between all npc's and fully experience all of the classes.   Once again, this is a wonderful games. There have been a few bugs here and there, and they are patched very quickly. Even if it was game breaking or character altering, they have done a great job making sure the patches are retroactive such that you don't lose anything in your current playthroughs.   My one true complaint, is the load times can be really long, especially when loading just a small house. My PC is quite capable to handle anything this game throws at it, but the loading times can be really long.  5-Stars.",

Obsidian is clearly banking on nostalgia and a current dearth of stats heavy RPG to sell this 'homage' to D&amp;D 3.5E replete with kobolds, character classes and themes found in earlier games when they did have the Wizards of the Coast (formerly TSR's) license. The combat system and lore etc were clearly tweaked from their earlier games and I am sad to say PoE's plot is mediocre at best and not in the least bit engrossing at all.   Technical issues from a previous era made a reappearance such as the inability to see the bottom and right corners of the isometric map with no camera rotation allowed. Graphics are even worse than many games found on mobile devices these days. Gameplay allows you to cheese most encounters via doorways and pulling enemies one by one. If one was to compare this poor effort to the games they made 15-20 years ago by imagining it was released back then as a competing game, the Baldur's Gate and Icewind series would have massively outsold it. There is no rousing score, just some background musak. Voice acting is ok, given the dearth of good material they have to work with.   Back to the 'modern' era, with a cherry on top to add insult to injury for this US$45 full retail price PC game, it panders to Western 'progressive' political sensibilites. In the first place, why bring politics into gaming in the first place? If you really dislike this sort of thing, avoid this game like the plague.   But I have to admit they got me good with regards to the lack of stats heavy RPGs currently and I do like the greater flexibility of builds as compared to D&amp;D 3.5E. Any class can wear full armor without additional penalties and can go sword and board for example=. No weapon restrictions either and firearms finally made an introduction.   Avoid at all cost if you are not a RPG fan, pick it up at US$10-15 if you want to scratch that D&amp;D 3.5E RPG itch.",

The first is that it's a great world to be in, to learn about, and to interact with. There are a number of consistent themes throughout the story that are brought to the fore in a number of different quests and in your relationships with your companion NPC's. I wouldn't call it a 'cerebral' game, but it brings up interesting questions and there were many times I had to think about what choice I really wanted to take and how I wanted to interact with the companions. The second is that it's a fun turn-based combat game. While there are a lot of quests and storyline progression that is able to be done through conversation, you fight a lot in this game. And it's a ton of fun (if you like real-time with pause gameplay). There are a number of varied and viable builds for different classes and a lot of different ways to play and do well.",

The games that even today you can recall the story of and still feel butterflies in your stomach when you talk about them.  That's what this game will be. Its deep and engaging world makes you not only pay attention to the little details and story points, but also makes you feel sympathy for the characters and the events that are taking place. In an age of flashy games with QTEs and fast paced action, this game slows you down and makes you think of strategys, defeating that 'Trash mob' that didn't drop anything and wasn't even needed to progress is exciting, after realizing how difficult it was to overcome that battle.  Theres times I just stopped, read a book, and wanted to cry. You know those books in games like skyrim which are just a waste of time to read, in this game it can be something so deeply engaging that you want to keep reading. While theres plenty of bugs (soon to be fixed with 2.0) and the games scaling may be a bit to punishing (for kids growing up in the age of call of duty, and WoW handing out epics, achievements, and free wins) this game is quickly becoming the best game I have played since Final Fantasy 7.

It's very much in the spirit of the classic Baldur's Gate games, and not an action game with RPG elements like so many 'modern' RPGs. This is an excellently-crafted homage to the history of role playing gaming. I'll note that it's not perfect, but none of these games ever were. There's so much content that if you try to play through all of the quests and tasks, you'll hit the level cap (even with White March Pt 1) LONG before you finish the game, and it's a bit jarring to have so many characters partially-voiced. One paragraph of dialog will be voiced, the next won't be, and the one after that will be. The voice-over patterns seem to make no sense, but it's better than having no voice-overs at all. Regardless of its faults, I wholeheartedly recommend this to any RPG fan.  If you just want fast-twitch action, you're better off looking elsewhere. This game will not interest you.",

The reason is because regardless of difficulty level your party is always hopelessly outclassed. Anyone who has played Icewind Dale or Baulder's Gate knows to expect difficulty, however, the key in this game is to explore. Problem is if you leave the beaten path you die, if you follow the story missions you die, if you search for a place to kill low level creatures to level up or make gold you die. This game is every bit as punishing as a legitimate game of Dungeons and Dragons. The only difference is you can never get a lucky stat roll in the beginning that makes you strong enough to survive, and there is no DM to throw you a bone when he realizes that making level 1 heroes kill 5 level 10 creatures just isn't going to work.  The game is a completed project that plays like a beta. It needs to be tweaked. Difficulty is fine, but it is obvious that the intent of this game is to make the player run an encounter a dozen or so times until they just get randomly lucky and make it through it.",

Because of this, I'm too underleveled for the main boss (I've lost about 30 times), so I might have to load up an earlier save and grind side quests to level up.  However, the game is pretty boring at this point, and I really don't have the inclination to go back and grind exp.

Pushing thirty hours into the game, I still feel as if I've barely scratched the surface. I will come back and review the rest of the game upon completion, but for now I'm having a great time.  The basics of the game mechanics &amp; systems are easy to learn, but they're much harder to master. I've ran into a few fights that trounced me soundly, only to return victorious after reading the in-game journal a bit closer and adjusting my strategies. I'm playing on normal, and I expect my understanding of the rules to be challenged even further on subsequent playthroughs using higher difficulties and optional restrictions while achievement hunting.   Perhaps excepting easy difficulty (I don't know as I'm not playing on it), this isn't a game you can brute-force your way through without learning at least the basics of the underlying rules system. If you're familiar with tabletop RPGs or the details of the old Infinity Engine games, you will adjust quickly. The rest of you should take your time to learn a bit each time you run into a fight that pushes your abilities. You will do better in subsequent fights, and you will come to appreciate the level of work Obsidian put into the behind-the-scences systems.  Additional playthroughs will also be required to see more aspects of the story. Certain choices you make build (or destroy) reputation with various people and factions, opening up new pathways while closing off others.  Obsidian has shown committment to the game's continued quality by quickly issuing a patch that addressed a serious item bug. Addons, DLC, expansions (whatever you want to call them) are already in the pipe.  The game's quality is, thus far, exactly what you should expect from Josh Sawyer, Tim Cain, Chris Avellone, and the rest of a crack team of rpg greats under the leadership of Feargus Urquhart (If those names don't mean anything to you, then you have a lot of very good RPGs to discover.

The music, while amazing, can become repetive  -The follwers are greatly thought out, but having voice acting in certain parts and not others seems offputting. i understand their limited budget of $4 million, but if obsidian is gonna hire voice actors for companions, do the whole damn conversation - The bugs in the game. Especially on endless paths lvl 13. It's like obsidian had hollowborn do their QA and bugfixing  -The realtime with pause can get annoying when certain summoned allies, like skeletons from the chanter, die too. i knoiw i can set that feature off, but these summons should not be pause when down.  -having to pay IN GAME currency to learn spells from a spellbook seems odd. like im paying myself to learn it, but the money then goes away. i wish you could see someone like an archmage to learn the spells and pay him, but instead, you basicly through money at your grimoire to learn the spell.

It really hard to find a stash and sometimes conversations make you laugh or shiver from horror.   Graphics and overall atmosphere of the game are really good but i felt like there are not enough details and maps are a little bit too empty and boring. Also you won't find this game 'original' - it looks like many others old-school RPGs.   Inventory system is very convenient but combat is very hardcore - you are not allowed to make mistakes.

But just because it is familiar doesn't mean it's poorly done. Obsidian proves that have an excellect stable of writers working on their projects, one of the best in the industry currently. And that is where this game shines. Sure, much of the gameplay harkens back to isometric games - it has to. It's a video game of a specific type. Sure, there isn't the limitless freedom of a tabletop. It can't be - this isn't D&amp;D, or Pathfinder, 13th Age or any other tabletop game. If you want that then go down to a local game store and find yourself a GM and a group of players. But for what it is, it is among the best games available today and a fantastic addition to the fantasy RPG stable on par with the classics.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR Version:  Excellent if you really want that old school party RPG feel. Frustrating if you've moved on from those days and enjoy more modern seamless experiences.  Full Review:  It's very well made but I can't recommend it to anybody but the most committed old school RPG fans. I remember playing Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, and the rest. Those games forced you to work for everything and this game dutifully recreates that feeling. Unfortunately I think I'm not able to enjoy that anymore.  I'm currently on a relatively early 'boss' encounter on the easiest difficulty and despite repeated attempts with different strategies it's clear I'm underleveled for it. That's fine and there's an easy solution. I leave, I do some other quests, and I come back later where the same group of people will be standing in the same position patiently waiting for me to return.  More 'modern' RPGs don't do things this way. It's a lot clearer in games with modern design whether you should try a particular quest through context hints or story progression. (Red skulls, colored quests in a journal, etc)  So instead of more organically making your way through the gameworld by using the clues in the environment about what is going to be fun for you to do next, PoE doesn't hold your hand in any way. You can easily blunder into an encounter you won't be able to beat with the current party you have but you won't even know until you're at the doorway to the encounter. It doesn't matter if you're interested in resolving the quest, the fact is you may not be able to. So you walk away and leave and do something else, leaving that quest artificially unresolved and breaking the immersion.  It's a phenomenally well produced game and very good at what it does, but what it does isn't something I like much anymore.       ",

If you don't like reading or lore heavy games then this might not be the game for you since the game focuses greatly on the text narrative (main story is voice acted but you still need to read quite much) and if you try to play this with skipping the reading you end up bored. And I feel like the choices you make (at least majority of them) have nice impact on game and aren't just artificial. Only bad thing I want to mention is that sometimes pathfinding is pretty fustrating when you are in combat (some narrow corridors etc.). If you pick this up give it time and don't try to play this with the mindset of 'rush to the end' just play for the journey not for the completion.",

The world has no depth, no style, it's generic and uninteresting. Nothing within the story or world gives me any reason to care about... anything. The quality writing from past Obsidian games is not to be found here.  It tries too hard to appeal to nostalgia, even using 2.5D when 3D graphics are perfectly feasible and superior in this day and age (plus the inability to rotate camera limits combat effectiveness). I guess gamers don't know that 2.5D was used instead of 3D in 1990s RPGs only because 3D graphics couldn't produce the details they desired, obviously not the case now. No need to use imitation 3D anymore.  The stat/rule system has some depth (a lot by today's standards), but not enough skills or feats. No noteworthy spells or abilities, such a lack of originality here. Combat balance is lacking, but the gameplay is diverse and supportive of many different character builds as far as combat goes, yet combat still feels like a chore. Party AI is not very customizable at all so it's best left disabled at least for mages. Lots of skill checks, attribute checks, and race checks exist in gameplay and dialogue but despite this there isn't a particularly noteworthy amount of role-playing since the dialogue still limits your personality a lot.  It isn't a horrible game but it doesn't do enough for me to suggest playing it. It is not a very deep RPG; outside of combat the game won't change much upon replays. It is a mediocre RPG (although above average by today's standards) that banks on nostalgia and nothing more. Modding is extremely limited at best, not that this is a good platform to play RPGs on to begin with since much better ones exist (like Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition and Neverwinter Nights 2).",

A few points...  The game is needlessly taxing on the computer. Sure it runs easily enough on any modern PC but it requires so much more than the games that inspired it and offers almost nothing in return. It would be great if it ran better on old PCs and mediocre laptops, I could recommend it to far more people and I wouldn't have to play on my desktop or listen to my laptops fans spin.  It's not D&amp;D/Forgotten Realms, it's an imitation. Aumaua? Godlike? Orlan? What? No thanks. The classes are a little more classicly inspired but things like mediocre rangers and their mediocre and required pets really put me off. Charcter attributes/stats are also classicly inspired but with needless changes that only seem to make the game 'different' but not more coherent or fun.  The playerbase also seems needlessly focused on the numbers behind it all. Searching for questions you might have in regards to character creation and weapons leads to so many posts on math and numbers and the 'right' attributes and skills that I wonder if people even bother exploring the game world and rules behind it and if not, why even play? In short it feels like a large portion of the playerbase are min-maxers and that the game was built with them in mind.  A good game but if you're here because of Baldur's Gate then go play that.

PoE is palpably DRIPPING with passion and love, the creators have put EVERYTHING they could cram into this game and unfortunatley, at least for me, it's all a bit too much.  With the D&amp;D universe I know what to expect from monsters, I know that fire hurts trolls and kale kills hobbits, sorry I meant halflings. In PoE I have to learn the eccentricities of a swathe of all new unfamilar critters with resistances and weaknesses I need to glean from reading through a scrolling combat log while trying to micromanage every idiot step of my reckless party members. Maybe I'm getting too old, but it was just way too much information for me to have to take in while trying to immerse myself in the overarching story and world.  There are two sides to many PC RPGs, the dungeon hack (loot and levels) side and the rpg side (world building and narrative). When the dungeon hack component requires every ounce of analytical skill in order to 'game' the combats into your favour, it's very difficult to maintain immersion. Theere's just too much going on in the combat as far as I'm concerned and it's stopped me giving this game the time it deserves because it's such a chore keeping my head above water in the combat.  There's so many stats, resistances, classes, and powers, spells, ubiquitous magical items of every conceivable variation, gelatinous cubes in every hue, ARGH it's too much! A product is complete not when you've added everything to it that you can think of but when you've taken away everything that it can do without.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Really captures the BG vibe. Highly recommended for fans of the IE games. Writing is solid throughout, even if some companions are a bit flat. The new mechanics are a mixed bag of hits and misses. Wish there was a higher level cap. Glad I backed it, and can’t wait for the expansion and future continuations of the series.   If you miss the good old days of BG, do yourself a favor and just buy this now. For those of you who have managed to miss one of the best CRPGs ever made keep reading for the rundown.  PoE uses a RTwP system with plenty of options for auto-pausing, as well as a slow mode to briefly slow the action down and get your tactics set. While your uncontrolled party members lack an AI like BG (used spells on their own based on AI chosen) they do auto attack without input.   A lot of the more complex rules are gone and things are much simpler for new comers (no need to know what THAC0 is). Many abilities have a limited number of uses per combat and other have a limited number per rest always providing choices in combat. At higher difficulties the number of enemies grows, you get higher enemies types (Black Ooze &gt; Lesser Black Ooze), and the number of camping supplies you can carry is extremely limited (Hard and up). Depending on how much problems you have with combat this could be an issue. Crafting has also been added, though it’s far from a great implementation in my opinion.  The diversity of races and classes doesn't disappoint. Each race has a choice between two subraces which gives them a racial bonus. Many of the races, and classes, will be familiar in general make up to normal fantasy tropes, but there's also some unique things like God touched (the lack of a helm is a drawback) and Ciphers. Character creation overall is pretty good and adding in custom portraits is quite easy.  Some of the newly designed systems do fall a bit flat though. The new stat system really lowers the importance of min/maxing. On the one hand this means casual players won’t be stopped by bad builds, but people who enjoy character building may feel let down by the diminished emphasis on stats. XP is no longer given on a by kill basis, instead being rewarded for bestiary additions. For example, a little bit of experience the first few times you fight a monster till you know everything about it, then none at all. Depending on play style this can lead to a fair amount of unrewarding combat.   A minor complaint includes most NPCs not feeling as interesting as BG. The low level cap (12) is disappointing, though understandable. You will most likely hit the cap long before the game is over if you pursue most side quests. After that point the lack of character progression feels a bit unrewarding sadly. Considering they designed a ruleset from scratch and had a limited budget it’s understandable, but still a bit of a let down. I expect this ground up design is also the reason for the limited number of abilities and spells compared to AD&amp;D.  Unfortunately at the time of this review there are bugs. Obsidian is still patching, but their official communication regarding it has been pretty poor. However, they are an established midrange studio so we know it's coming, eventually.",

I've been looking for a good old-school RPG and Pillars of Eternity fills that void. However, I feel that I should provide a PSA and say this game in it's current state has too many game breaking bugs. I saw other post or talk about some of the game breaking bugs but I figured I would just be careful and may not encounter some of the big ones. How successful have I been? Moderately, but if you slip up even once you will end up rolling back your game and losing hours of progress. Therefore I cannot recommend this game in its current state. I am sure in a few weeks all these issues will be resolved and at that time I'll try playing this again.  If you do choose to proceed ahead, please be aware and cautious of these game breaking bugs:  1. Do not double-click to assign equipment. Always drag and drop them into the slots, especially when replacing equipment. If not, you risk losing ALL your passive buffs. This issue seems to occur most when replacing equipment. You may not run into the issue but I would not recommend risking it. By the time you realized this has happened it you may not be able to recover.   This also happens for your follows. The fix for this is to remove and add your followers back however see the below bug before proceeding.  2. Adding/removing followers clears their inventory. Others have reported this and I have seen this myself. Followers lose all their inventory items and they do not seem to just be moved to your stash. Again, by the time you realize you'll end up rolling back quite a ways. Remove all items from follower's inventory before dismissing them.  3. Adding/removing followers cause mouse movement to stop working. I've only experience this once while adding and removing followers at the Stronghold but outside of any buildings. You can still click on doors and exits to get your party to move their and your mouse works otherwise but click movement stops working. The workaround is to completely exist the game and restart.  4. Saving while sneaking causes ranger pets to disappear. If you load a save where you were sneaking it causes ranger pets to disappear and the portrait is just replaced with a white circle. This will prevent you from leaving the area and loading older saves may not help. The best workaround is to completely exit the game and try loading again. You may need to try this a few times before your pet will return.  Again, I love this game, but not in it's current state. You may not encounter any of the above issues and I may have just been extremely unlucky and hit all of them, but I highly advise you to not risk it. The above isn't even anywhere near a complete list of bugs. I doubt these are even the all game breaking ones, but this was as much as I could tolerate. The 30 hours of game-play is probably at least 10 hours of retracing my steps due to a rollback.",

It genuinely nails what it goes for, and in a way that can be appreciated by everyone, not just those who dribble nonsense about 'AAA games' and 'this generation'.  Pillars of Eternity is a strange creature. It's a game that goes full-power tryhard on reviving the 'extraneous choices and deep worldbuildy flavor ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere' genre.  This includes the authentically un-fun gameplay of tabletop-style resource management for successful endurance-run dungeon delving. It also attempts to refine and polish-not-polish the nostalgically ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay of slow paced combat where actions are measured in seconds instead of turns, and the game can and MUST be paused every two seconds. Honestly, it sucks. I can't even watch my characters cinematically fight it out; I have to do stop-motion animation by pausing to order them to cast spells.  Additionally, to appease those who bemoan the simplicity of streamlined, well-designed games (get over yourselves), there's extraneous ♥♥♥♥ EVERYWHERE. History books somehow find their way into loot containers, nudging and winking at the player with a 'hey, no pressure, but there's some awesome *worldbuilding* here, maybe you wanna right-click to examine, just saying.' And I've learned not to bother clicking on anyone with a fanciful name who's standing around minding their own business. At least the books give context for the culture and history of the land; seeing an episode from the past life of Waerdvuc Thaeserane is a completely pointless indulgence for some writer that's in love with their own work.  And yet... it's all done with a very experienced and professional hand. The writing is genuinely good; this is the novel-ish writing that the nostalgiafriends like to think that all those old games have. This is a game made by people who wanted to write something for you--who used the formula and the genre (the dated formula and the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ genre, or is that the other way around) to create something cool. It's a vast writing project made by people who poured their souls into it (hurr) with the obsessive fervor and questionable priorities of fanfic authors being told in no uncertain terms that their work will be read by millions of people, and they are talented authors who got it right.  I'm the kind of person who would normally be so turned off by this game's badness that I wouldn't be able to forgive it--but there is definitely something to enjoy here, even for me.",

POE combat is real-time and poorly suited to anyone who wants proper control over battles. Even when using pause on/off it's too difficult to know what's happening and player chars are too hard to locate; and it's a nightmare trying to guess which chars are waiting for their next command or still finishing their previous command. There is a wall of stats to sift through to discern what's happening and figure your best moves, but it's too much and too laborious to find the important bits of info. The battles in POE couldn't have been so amazing and epic due to all the various stats, items, and possibilities. I've since learned on forums that most players just use the Ai to resolve battles - this just seems like a terrible waste to me and a missed opportunity.   - So much text. I'm perfectly fine with lots of text (I've been playing RPGs since forever both CRPGs &amp; Pen &amp; Paper). But I really wish there was a TLDR version/option/summary. You see, these days I don't have half as much time to jump on screens, so I'd prefer not to spend it reading, reading, reading. The quest logs summarize what's to be done, but a rolling summary of ech story arc would be great for those of us who'd like to get on with adventuring. When I'm a senior and retired I'll have all the time in the world to read away.   - The statistics &amp; attributes have broken away from the typical D&amp;D system. That's not necessarily a bad thing of course, but it certainly requires a different mindset and was a bit confusing at first. Admittedly I'm old school and I'm not a fan of every stat/ability/skill etc available to all races &amp; classes.  Everything else about the game is perfect.

To be completely honest - this is basically Baldur's Gate without some annoying stuff from oroginal game and on a prettier engine. Big map structure, that one big city, basically everything for me was screaming 'Hey! We played Baldur's Gate and if you like it, here is more!'. Pillars of Eternity is an enjoyable game. Combat is smooth, environments don't scale with you leveling up so there is a big chance of you getting into places where complete and utter fisting will be committed on your characters. Stuff like that makes leveling up more powerful. Literally :)  Combat is good. I'm not a hardcore guy for this kind of games to play them on max difficulty. It's either normal or easy for me. And on those difficulties game is fun and tactical. You'll be using spells tactically, buffs and so on. However on later levels classes will be used for basically 1-2 skills and the rest will be irrelevant. There is that.  From story point of view - side quests are much more interesting than main quest. Even stories of your companions are more interesting, exciting and can be more emotional. Now... this can be a minor spoiler so you were warned. Romance in the game is   available as a part of main quest, but only if you choose it (I played through only once so didn't bother with new run and selecting another option) and it's basically one way thing  . Me personally don't like it made that way, but apparently hardcore fans are loving it. Good for them I guess.  Now little bit not about game itself. I backed this game on kickstarter and as of time writing this review regreting doing so. Due to my region I could've buy it way cheaper and have no problems. Instead here is what we(Europeans) have: physical goods from game and game itself are not yet delivered and not even yet shipped (game release was around half a month ago or so) for around 99% of people from Europe. While cursed usa got it all basically day 1 because (I assume) in usa obsidian could be sued for not doing what they were given money to do. Apparently European customers are not so important for obsidian. They also ignored the fact that I had to get 2 copies of the game and only AFTER I pointed them into their promise, second game was added. And also funny thing - discs with games will not be delivered with game physical goods. When discs? Who knows. In 2016 I assume.  Another thing - developers can't hold their artistic integrity and some idiots from twitter can easily force them to change minor (so far it's minor) content in the game.  And another thing x2 - ANY communication from obsidian came only AFTER people were very vocal on their forums. And don't give excuse that delivery is now on paradox or whoever publisher is. I gave money to obsidian and demand my product from them.",

Most of the dialogs are interesting and when there is voice acting, it's usually pretty good (Except that wizard who sounds like a european hick, who doesn't sound like that in his intro dialog...). A lot of dialogs which are narrated have random dialog options which have no narrations, it really breaks the immersion and it's confusing. I'm still questioning if that's just a bug, but I don't think it is.  And the combat is really sloppy compared to games like neverwinter nights, or even divinity original sin (which is true turn based). Like, REALLY sloppy. Neverwinter nights was also a bit sloppy, some turns took 3x longer than you expect them. This game solves that problem by making everyones turn on separate timers so things happen back-to-back. If you are playing on a harder difficulty, you have to pause every single footstep. It's a bit ridiculous. Even if you are a serious cRPG player who expects clunky controls (ascii rpgs...), you're going to have a hard time with this one.  This is for the harder difficulties. Easy/normal are probably fine if you don't have to worry about all of the special events going on. But the harder difficulties are awful.  It's hard for the wrong reason, because you spend the whole time fighting the sloppy interface and sloppy controls. It's just not fun. I've had to fight underneath trees which don't even go invisible/transparent when you are underneath them. A lot of the time casters seem to stop doing anything and you have to micromanage things that should be automated.

PoE is a love paean to the old Infinity Engine RPG's, which is good in a way, because some of them had excellent writing, great impact in terms of your stats and skills having an effect on what you could do, and lots of choices. And this, too, is in Pillars of Eternity. Though 'great writing' may take a knock if you've played previous Black Isle/Obsidian RPG's because in short order you're going to realize that Avellone can really only write one story and he's whipped it out for us again.  In terms of mechanics, however... it's a mess. It's an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mess. The AI is terrible, the mechanics obtuse, the UI functional but only barely, status effect effects are hard to suss out, why skills sometimes work, why characters sometimes don't use their skills, whether a given skill affects friends, enemies or both... it's just frustrating and entirely un-engaging, thrown even more into perspective by Larian's recent amazing RPG, Divinity: Original Sin, which had much the same kind of combat(albeit fully turn-based) and did it  right  by making everything obvious and easily parsed, by giving you all the info you could ever want in, usually, an easily parsed fashion.   So it's a shame, a damn shame, that Obsidian didn't look around for a few clues here and there. The mechanics don't even work on the purely... mechanical level. Some people might complain that D&amp;D can be a kludgy, convoluted mess, and I'll agree to that, especially when it comes to the old 2nd edition AD&amp;D that the Infinity Engine games(Icewind Dale 2 excepted) were largely based on. But whatever monstrosity Obsidian's stitched together in their basement is even more confusing.  While I intend to play through the remainder of Pillars of Eternity, and may even come to be more positive about it. At the moment? I'm going to recommend that no one buy this game unless they already made the mistake of kickstarting or pre-ordering it, in which case they may as well wring what fun they can out of it.",

I am extremely impressed with story side of things and I doubt it will get worse.   Gameplay:   The gameplay is perfect. There is a fun stealth mechanic as well. Traps to look out for, hidden treasure or passage ways to be found. As for combat it is excellent. A lot of strategy to be at hand. Trying to assemble bottleneck's, your own trap's, mass of spells and ton's of variety to keep it interesting. Although sometimes the combat does feel taxing. Constantly pausing and unpausing but I don't mind it, just a note.  Graphics/Sound:   The graphics are perfect. Literally the best of any RPG with this flavor. The zone's are awesome to run around in and just look amazing. Spells look fantastic and combat has weight to it. It looks great and makes the big battles pure eye candy to watch. The sound as well is perfect. Amazing music, some of the best I have heard in awhile. It blend's in very well. With both of these so top notch for the game it really has a high immersion affect. Playing in the dark you just get sucked into this game.  Performance:   Runs perfect as anyone would expect. No FPS drops or crashes. I have not ran into any bugs as well. Although I am playing a month or so after the release date. In other words the game has 0 issues.   Replayability:   To much. Ton's of classes to play and choices to make.

This is Baldur's Gate brought back modern day the literal best way possible. I can't quit playing and I am yet to not enjoy myself as hours upon hours just pass by. GOTY.",

This game immediately takes you back to the great classics like Baldur's Gate 2, Planescape Torment, and Icewind Dale and is easily just as good as any of those games.  The game's environments are beautiful specially considering the developers are using the original Infinity engine which though is updated was created in the mid 90's. The story isn't ground breaking as far these types of games go but it is very good and has a good balance between keeping the story moving and giving the player tons of interesting and fun side quests that don't ever feel tedious.The character creation is everything an rpg fan could hope for, giving you hundreds of combinations to make your ideal characters in several very different classes.

            "review_text": "Disclosure: I am a huge Infinity Engine fan.  In the interest of providing a full appreciation for what you are getting in to I will break this down in to several sections, if you only want information on a certain area just skip ahead!  Story/Plot: Yea: Some difficult choices to be made. Generally a lack of a binary good or evil setup. The world is huge and the lore in depth.   Nay: The main story is generic fantasy fair. Revolutionary it is not. Sometimes hard to role-play certain types of character due to the lack of consistent options in conversation.  Quests: Yea: Meaningful and substantial, throughout the games. Side quests are plentiful and offer a good reason to explore the world and get the most out of the setting.   Nay: The pacing is a little off in places, potentially leading to a lack of drive to finish the story.  Characters: Yea: Very developed back stories.  A lack of one dimensional characters.  Nay: Limited inter-party banter. Party has no bearing on your actual conversations. Bordering on blind followers. Seems like you could slap their Mother with a wet fish and they wouldn't bat an eyelid.  Script/Writing: Yea: Phenomenal writing.   Voice acting: Yea: Some very impressive voice work, including some fantastic stand outs. Plenty of voiced conversations; there can always be more, but for me there was oodles.  Nay: During conversations there are written descriptions to bring the conversation to life. The voice acting does not pause for this, even when it says that the character paused! This can be jarring.  Art/Design: Yea: Art and aesthetics are always personal, but I loved it.   Nay: Some random, extremely low resolution assets that would have looked old fashioned in the original Infinity games. Infrequent, but they stick out like a sore thumb  Impact of decisions: Yea: It was sometimes difficult to tell the result of your actions and sometimes it was obvious as a sword to your enemies gut. You traverse the world and cause waves of action and interest.   Nay: Sometimes a little too unclear or obtuse regarding what would happen when making the choice.  Combat/AI: Yea: Clever, nuanced classes without thematic considerations.  Strong variety of moves. Several options to support style of combat desired (e.g. turn based, slow mode etc). Some challenging combat, with consideration and calculation being necessary. (Though of course a little luck never hurts.)  Nay: Classic issues of not auto-attacking and getting caught on allies.  It is not obvious what move the hero is using until you actually select them (i.e. no overhead display of move selected for use).   Bugs: Yea: Not as many as expected, does that count?  Nay: Voice cuts to halfway through sentences periodically. Voice cut out/became muted. Some events fail to trigger. Steam achievements didn't update for me.    Features/Options: Yea: Lots of customisable options, such as hiding meta information (e.g. possible conversation options you lack requirements for). Regular, helpful tooltips.   Nay: Tooltips don't always relate to what they pop-up for (seems to be on a keyword search so damage may bring up the 'damage' tooltip, though it refers to 'mitigating damage'). Some options don't seem to work as intended or implied (e.g. show relative defense values, limit stash). Pets that add almost nothing. Some locked slots on the inventory that never unlock (did I miss something?)  Noticeable omissions: When in main team location you have to swap out characters to be able to look at their items.  Humour - other than the odd comment (and maybe one particular character) there is very little of the light-heartedness or amusing comments as seen in other Infinity games. Meaningful differences in loot. Each new weapon tends to be a small, numerical difference from the others. The few that seem to have potentially interesting differences are poorly explained. Explanations of the enchanting system.  Overall:  Loved almost every minute of it. To anyone who enjoyed the Infinity games, anyone who has enjoyed a party based cRPG I would recommend this. I would also recommend it to anyone who has a passing interest in roleplaying, or immersing themselves in a new and fantastic world.   Some improvements are definitely available for the developers, but they are not needed to make the game feel whole and substantial. The game is polished and fulfilling and it is only a matter of time before I play it again.  ",

Fallout, Planescape Torment, Mask of the Betrayer,and Bloodlines were huge steps forward from Balders Gate, and to be honest going back to Balders Gate is a step back, even though it is better than many games produced since then.  The plot is OK, the lore is OK, the dialogue is OK, the combat is actualy slightly revolutionary - with in theory compromises having to be made. No one character can be everything. However, really it just means you have tanks and ranger dps. Not that exciting in practice. Combat can be challenging sometimes, but there are one or two attacks that are overpowered (such as confusion and dominate) and if those aren't used it is a breeze usually. Traps are annoying and very silly. They are disproporiate in terms of damage and they often instakill parties who are not sneaking all the time in dungeons.  It is an above average CRPG.",

They were virtual smorgasbords of RPG goodness, and they were tactically challenging. People could build incredible graffics as time went on... but never could duplicate the level of content and pure adventure and world building the way both Bioware and Obsidian could back during those initial games.   Even those two couldn't top themselves in later games. The still did great work at RPGs, but never again could they top themselves in later games.

If you loved the RPG classics like Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale or their sequels, you will enjoy this game.  I can say that I had a blast with it. The only real criticism I have is that I felt that the combat is a little too hard. My first playthrough was on easy (which I chose after being warned of how hard it was by a fellow reviewer) and I really struggled to keep my party alive - especially in the first half of the game. It did get a little easier (and more fun) later on, but I feel that the combat balance is still off slightly for the earlier levels. But other than that, I have no real gripes.  In my opinion it's a great game! Even better if you factor in that it was a crowd-funded project. Well done to everyone involved.",

            "review_text": "Where can I begin? Pillars of Eternity is Obsidians love letter to the Black Isle Infinity Engine role-playing games of the '90s, gloriously brought up to date with minimal hitches. While the game has gone gold, they're still making balance changes to the familiar(and new) classes.   Anyone that's played any iteration of Dungeons and Dragons will recognize the staples of the Fighter, Wizard, Rogue and Druid for the most part. The games wrinkle on Paladins, Priests, Barbarians and Rangers make them feel unique and their custom classes(the Cipher which is similar to a Psionic and the Chanter, a Bard-like class) stand out quite well.   The combat is point and click with the ability to pause(or slow down) the combat to make on the fly decisions, only really marred by a slightly finicky 'Engagement System'(especially with a multitude of enemies that love to teleport directly to your squishiest party members) and a pathing system that does not want to work at all sometimes.  The story itself is a bit of a standard 'thrust into greatness' kind of deal, with your character becoming ill while traveling to another territory and getting caught in what's known as a Biawac, a storm that rips the souls from a persons very being, killing them outright. However, you not only do NOT die but become what is known as a 'Watcher', a person that can manipulate souls on a personal level. What starts out as a quest to find a 'cure' for your condition or at least find out what happened turns into a race to save the kingdom of Dyrwood from an insidious conspiracy.  Now, what makes the games story good are the interesting NPC party members you get. From the dirty old man of a Priest of Magran, Durance to the jovial giant of a scholar Kanas, the whole cast is voiced and written well.   Onto the writing, it drips with atmospheric detail and is easily the strongest point of the game and quite an enjoyable read.  For a newcomer to the kind of game this represents, it can be daunting with all the numbers and percentages and terms but it offers tutorials and multiple difficulty settings as well. For veterans, this is a glorious callback to the 'days of yore' of CRPGs and I heartily recommend it to anyone that's enjoyed an Infinity Engine game in the past.",

            "review_text": "Man, what a ride! Obsidian really delivered on their promise. The game will certainly have an added appeal for any nostalgic Infinity Engine fan, but it's nevertheless a solid standalone effort delivering outstanding gameplay. After putting in about 70 hours into a single playthrough, here are my five cents:  The pros (in no particular order):  1) Infinity engine. It helps PoE imbue the adventure with a sense of wonder and immersion that has been missing from the recent AAA titles. I've put in more than 100 hours into Dragon Age: Inquisition, and while the visuals were great, I couldn't shake off the feeling of the world being too inanimate and generic. Same goes for Skyrim, which, while joyfully interactive, suffered from predictable copy-and-paste patterns in many of its environments. Paradoxically, while Infinity Engine is supposed to basically present the environment as an isometric drawing, it really makes the world come alive and feel inhabited not only by the PCs, but by everyone else, including the foes you encounter. The artwork here is top-notch, with every area, including, for example, such mundane things as inns, having a unique feel and presentation that really urges you to explore every bit of it.  2) Exploration. PoE plays like a true RPG should, with traps, surprises, hidden passways and more to be found in every cave and dungeon. And they feel very organic and logical. The game is brimming with content, and a small dungeon level can easily take up 40+ minutes of game time even without any wipes. And yet it never feels repetitive, as you always have a sense of purpose. There is a 15-level dungeon, and all of the levels are interesting in their own way. This speaks volumes about the approach of Obsidian, and it's really showing. Having a pen-and-paper RPG cut-ins (texts that describe you jumping over a ridge etc.) was also a greatly appreciated touch.  3) Combat. Hands down, this is the best combat system of any RPG I played, and I started with Might&amp;Magic 6 back in the day. It elegantly improves on the classic D&amp;D formulas that were so awesomely implemented by BioWare in Baldur's Gate, and makes combat dynamic and enjoyable. It also feels very balanced, with different character classes adding different flairs to the whole gig. I guess the greatest compliment to the combat system is that you are forced to use different tactics throughout the game, not just stick to the same 'optimal' formula for every encounter (I'm looking at you, Dragon Age). As in any true RPG, the combat in PoE strarts with carefully selecting gear for your party. The system that Obsidian came up with (balance between attack speed, damage, interrupt chance, recovery speed, damage reduction and accuracy/deflection) is so obvious and fair that I'm inclined to call it genius. I have played pen-and-paper D&amp;D starting with 2nd edition, and this honestly beats any of the systems that they had, which is saying something.  4) Gear. I just love the fact that while there is an abundace of loot in the game, you are not spoiled for choice when it comes to equipping your guys. There are no overpowered 'no-brainer' choices in PoE, and it all comes down to balancing everything. Item buffs don't stack, which is a great little tweak that does wonders for you item and party management. Enchanting is also realized very well, but I have to say that IMHO Dragon Age did crafting better.  5) Story. Of course, with the game coming from Obsidian, it shouldn't come as a suprise, but the story in PoE is great. It doesn't necessarily reach BG2's or Fallout2's heights, but it's compelling and balanced. The team set out to introduce you to a new campaign setting (i.e. world), and they achieve just that, with you steadily gathering information and making sense of the whole history of the region the game unfolds in. That, to me, proved to be a very important aspect, because the main plot ties into the whole context of the world history brilliantly, and they basically enrich one another. There are enough fantasy tropes in play for the story to be accessible for any type of player, and while nuances are there for an inquisitive player to unearth and enjoy, you can do just fine without them.  6) Companions. PoE can't quite match the nuanced stories and personalities that BioWare offered for DA:I's companions, but interaction with them is still perfectly enjoyable. I loved some of the routes Obsidian decided to go with companions' quests, with most of them having thought-provoking, satisfying conclusions.  The cons (in no particular order):  1) A.I. Such a compelling combat system would be much better served by a stronger A.I. Opponents are not the brightest bulbs, and your party members will often run around frantically, lose track of their orders and generally require micromanagement, especially in tighter underground encounters. This has been a feature of virtually every Infinity Engine game, and it's kind of sad to still experience it in 2015. But this is a minor frustration, with key encounters wisely giving you the space you need to operate.  2) Voice acting. While it's admirable for such a low-budget project to have so much voice acting, it leaves much to be desired. While the dialogues themselves are quite ok (although they do suffer from being a bit too 'generic fantasy' at times), the delivery is sometimes cheesy and uninspired. The game also insists on adding flavor text describing emotions and behaviour of the person you are talking too, and while it worked really well for me in general, adding voice acting on top of that text makes both hard to follow and enjoy.   3) Size of the world. I feel kind of guilty mentioning this, but PoE could really use more areas to be explored. The game is filled with content as it is, but I can't help but think back to the sense of wonder that the first Baldur's Gate brought with its myriad optional areas. The average size of an area in PoE is also not that large. I guess you could squeeze out about 100 hours of gameplay by doing absolutely everything, but that's it. I'm not a big 'replay value' kind of guy, and I just wish that the game delivered more content, since the content that is in the game is absolutely outstanding. The world map is also a bit deceiving in this regard, with large area left without any of the zones to discover and explore.  Overall, I highly recommend this game to any RPG fan. It's a solid 9/10 in my book. I'm very excited for the upcoming expansion, because this is the type of world that really draws you in and clearly has more stories to tell.   P.S. I mostly play on consoles now, but I had no trouble hooking up my laptop to the TV and just kicking back with a remote keyboard/mouse, ps4-style. I had no problem whatsoever with reading text in the game. And, contrary to some opinions, I didn't think that there was too much reading involved.",

        {
            "review_text": "I loved Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, as well as Planescape: Torment. So when I heard that this game was coming out 2.5 years ago, I knew that I wanted it. So back then I helped Kickstart it, and over the past couple years I've watched this game grow. Every week I would log into the forums and see all of the communication between the players and the developers and I knew that what was coming would be a great game.   I played during the Beta, so I knew most of what I was getting in to.   Anyway, here are my thoughts.    Story:    So far the game has been amazing. I love the storyline and how it is developing. The game relies heavily on text to convey what is happening, which actually works really well. It's even cooler when you're talking to a guy and they describe his nervousness and your character can pick up on that (with the right stats/skills) and act accordingly.   They also give you a whole lot of options as to how your character might act. If you're the brash meathead that can't be bothered with the details or maybe the high minded philosipher that keeps himself at a distance from his emotions. All of your choices like that effect future conversations as you play out your character.   Also, I like the interactive scripts when you are trying to climb a wall for instance. You're either strong and skilled enough to do it yourself or you need to go find tools somewhere to help you out.   I could gush for hours about how I love the story, but suffice to say, It's a lot of fun, and I don't want to spoil anything.    Combat:    I am typically a combat round or pause and plan type of gamer. This game hits the mark for me. It has a built in pause system where you can set what events you would like the game to pause at. Weapon not effective? Pause. Spell finished casting? Pause. Etc. There is also a pause option, that you can create a more combat round feel. You can set the game to pause every few seconds. Which was pretty cool for me.   Additionally, there are many new classes that are a lot of fun to play with. I made a Chanter, which many might think of as a Bard. You have little phrases that your character chants and you can arrange them in the order that you like and they will play out during combat while you fight. The Cipher is pretty neat as well, as that is similar to a psionic warrior maybe? You run into combat and fight your opponent to build up power and then unleash your psychic assault on them when you've built enough resources. There are many more that I cant wait to try.   Lastly, the combat can be challenging, either expect to save often or die a lot as you learn to play. For instance, early in the game you run into monsters that will teleport behind the party and attack your weakest characters. You can't just run away, because there is a mechanic for disengagement, where if you just run, the monster gets a huge bonus to hit you while you do it, so you need to react quickly and do what's necessary to protect your more squishable party members.    Sound/Video:    The score for this is pretty good. I havent gotten tired of it yet. Voices are pretty cool so far, nothing has been annoying. I am very pleased with the sound in this game. I tend to get bored of the music in a game pretty quick and turn it off. I'm kind of excited to see how long I'll listen to the music in PoE. Also, in many games I get annoyed by certain character's voices (Over acted, shrill, or just plain annoying). So far they've all been really good.   As for Video, I think they did a really good job of updating the old Infinity Engine model. You have a more 3d version of your character that looks pretty cool and you can put different equipment on him and that looks good as well. The background art is really cool and I like how stylized the art is.   Anyway, the  Con's so far:   Sometimes pathing can get dumb, you'll click an empty space and the character won't move there. You move a character near that spot and the click there again and all of the sudden they can move there. That said, most of the time it works really well. I haven't experienced any of the pathing issues I had in the past where a party member would start running in some other rediculous direction or just stop moving.   Also.. I don't have enough time to play it... so that's a problem.  Anyway, that's it for now. I'm really happy that I believed in them, and I'm very more glad that they lived up to my expectations. Now, I need to get back to playing it!  ",

Of course, in doing so, I forfeited an entire quest line they could have offered. What if I played nice with the jerkwad family next time and beat up some goodies, instead?  There are a great variety of classes in PIllars, and thus an enormous variety in potential parties. Via companions you pick up along the way, you will get to play with most of the classes ... but not all. You'll need to create several PC's to get the full experience! I ended up running around most of my first playthrough with a fighter (PC), paladin, priest, canter, wizard, and cipher. Even a cursory view of the forums will tell you that is not an OP party; I just happened to relate to those companion characters the best. Next time, I'll try something completely different. Variety is the spice of life and of CRPG parties.  In my opinion, Pillars of Eternity is the frontrunner among the new generation of CRPG's coming out.",

I don't mind however, one playthrough already gives you plenty of hours of gameplay - there are a lot of things to know for unexperienced RPG players, so it can be a bit overwhelming  All in all, great game! 9/10 ",

            "review_text": "I'm going to say it flat out, I loved (love) this game. I'm still learning bits and pieces, but I've actually logged more hours (100+) than Steam says as I played it elsewhere for a time. I'm not going to spoil anything, but throw a series of vague answers out that may or may not allure the reader. And, I do mean vague. With that out of the way....  First off, story line: Do you like to learn more about your companions, and go on journeys with them to discover more intricate details on why and who they were before you met them?  Do you enjoy being able to ignore the main storyline for a time, and help or bring ruin to others through outside quests? Do you love being exposed to a mix of personalities, and possibly fanatical characteristics, that you may or may not fully agree with? Pillars of Eternity weaves a tale that carries its protagonist through a series of heartwrenching, yet enticing stories. The more you learn about the world, and the past (the war essentially), the more you want to help build a specific future or explore the depths of what this game has to offer.  Put yourself in your characters shoes, be the character, and let yourself go on an adventure where you indeed determine the future (multiple endings). By the way, I hope you like to read ( a lot ). There are voice overs with certain characters though.  Combat System: The combat system isn't too difficult, but it requires memorization (unless you find a combo that works for you everytime...which isn't fun, but it happens.) Depending on the companions you choose to take with you the majority of the time, you may or may not be required to know a majority of the spells or abilities they have.  Penalties that hinder your allies do occur, so pay special attention. Some bosses require a bit of strategy, positioning matters.  *When (if) you buy the DLC, if you've already beaten the main game, it gives you the option to make the DLC foes more difficult since you've leveled up. So, you needn't worry about blasting through all of them and it being 'way too easy.'   Side notes: Honestly, I love the artwork, and detail put into this game. It's absolutely gorgeous.  I would have to agree, it's a bit pricey. But, with the amount of time, effort, and detail put into it I can understand why. More content and patches are added as frequently as possible from my stand point, and I absolutely love that about the makers of this game. They haven't given up on it, it's ever-changing.  DLC: A friend of mine purchased this game for me on Steam when it was on sale, I believe it was 20-something dollars. Afterwards, I purchased the White March Pt. 1, and played through the majority of it the day I started. They're not too large, but they do add an extra something to explore in Pillars.  I've recently started the the 2nd part, and am still having a blast, although I'm almost finished that one as well. If you don't want to pay full price for the DLC since you can breeze through it, they have had it on sale on Steam a few times within the year. But overall, DLC included, it's a beautiful game and I would (and have) recommend it.",

At the beginning of the game, you can customize your character. I personally enjoyed this part very much. There are 11 classes to choose, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and playstyles. You also get to choose your character's sex, race and sub-race, culture, background. These choices will affect the attributes of your character.  You will start in a caravan that just arrived in Dyrwood. You get attacked by bandits, and then a storm appears that forces you to flee to a nearby ruins. There, you witness a ritual of a cult that knocks you out. As you awake, you see visions from the past, you can interact with souls of people. You become a Watcher. Meanwhile, many children in Dyrwood were born without souls, a period called as the Waidwen's Legacy. As you investigate, you see the connection between your condition and the Legacy...  I'll admit, I expected more from the story. I wasn't satisfied enough, as in it could have been better. It was, however, decent enough to keep me hooked until the end. There were also many side-quests that give more depth to the world. You can choose your stance about many things in the dialogs, choose sides in conflicts, keep promises, betray, etc., which is a big plus for me. You can find companions, each with their own quests and interesting backgrounds and personalities.  The gameplay is pretty good. I didn't know that I'd come to like real-time-with-pause combat system. I suspect this system is a turn-off for some people.   The graphic is good. The background, the scenery.... It's Skyrim in 2.5D fashion. No, okay, that was a bad exaggeration. But it's good.  The soundtrack and sound effects fits the atmosphere quite well, but they're a bit repetitive. Or maybe not really, I don't know, because I turned off the music halfway of the game. My bad.  All in all, it's a good game. As a first time CRPG player, I say it's worth every penny.  P.S.: I bought it on 50% sale.   ",

Also, the companions you find are seriously lacking in personality compared to Baldur's gate 1/2.

The various mechanics are clearly explained.  While the graphics are not as detailed as other games this generation, the writing, the most important part of any RPG, truly lives up to Pillars' distinguished pedigree, with difficult moral choices that affect your reputation, well-timed jokes and snarkiness to keep things from getting too grimdark, and mature, thoughtful exploration of difficult real-world subjects such as racial and religious prejudice.

Longer Version  It's a great game, remeniscent of the above mentioned Infinity Engine classics. The lore and world are completely new and yet feel very fleshed out and interesting to dive deeper into. The gameplay itself is pretty much exactly as the old games, with all advantages and disadvantages and I'd argue, that stealth was best in BG2. And I miss strong, single target heal spells. What irks me most is, that Obsidian's games still suffer from the same, I have to say, ineptitude to focus on the game itself. I know there were kickstarter stretch goals. But I'd have prefered a more polished game to one with a beastiary I never used or all the stuff that is in the special editions etc.  As it is, the beginning is far more detailed, scripted and has more voice acting, than sections in the middle, where some things feel sloppy. The voice acting ranges from 'good' to 'who wants to have his voice in our game?'. The ending tries to get back on track and to tie everything together, in which it mainly succeeds. But it relies a lot on exposition to achiev this. Nontheless, I greatly enjoyed the game and look forward to what else will come out of this franchise, with planned board and card games and I'd wish for a book or two, collecting some of the backstories.",

It's fresh and (so far) decently balanced while still giving a good varienty of options. Want to be a wizard that wears armor? Sure. What to be a barbarian with good AoE?

Even when I went to replay the classics like Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc. Divinity and Wasteland were fun, but I found myself playing them less and less. I have also all but given up on console games except for the occasional match of fifa, 2k, etc with a friend. So I started looking (desperately) for lists of the best isometric games since thats what got me into gaming as a kid. I figured I would relive the nostalgia of childhood and then I could appreciate video games again.     I foolishly thought isometric games were a thing of the past, and even drumming up old best of lists wasnt getting me into it. That's when I discovered Pillars of Eternity. I mean on paper it looked great, almost too great. Obsidian and Paradox teaming up to do an isometric game which would be releasing right when I was contemplating giving up on video games for good. Sign me up! After exploring all the kickstarter videos and seeing what was in store for the game I knew it was gonna be good. I told all my friends (no multiplayer sadly) they were skeptical, but eventually swayed. So I pre-ordered then eventually pre-loaded. Then all that was left was waiting for the game to drop.   Finally the day came. I booted it up and was surpised by how unassuming the game was. No crazy cutscenes with like 10 loading/sponsor screens to click through. The music while not as epic as some of the classics is still in the same vain as Icewind Dale etc. What really surprised me was how deep and balanced the character creation was. I mean you know you got a good game when your still creating a character an hour into the game for the first time. I finally settled on a build and went for it.    What I noticed immediately was the text based picture approach instead of cutscenes all over the place. This is awesome. It really immerses you into the story, and they even add some like choose your own adventure style options. Also little details like the cursor for instance are right out of the late 90's. Combat is deep and rich. There are a lot of tactical choices and the games difficulty and depth is a challenge for any gamer. I have only played for about 5 hours, but already I've noticed the skillful writing and diologue. Also while the graphics are nothing to write home about Pillars is an isometric game, so its to be expected and appreciated.   This has been my first review of a game on Steam. I have been on Steam for a bit and own a decent amount of games, but no game has grabbed my attention like this since Diablo II. If you like isometric games/rpg/tabletop DND etc buy this game. You will like it. If your new to isometrics this is a great place to start so you should buy this game. The only way I would not suggest this game is if you can't read. In which case this message will never reach you, sorry. Also if your under 13 probably not a good game since it requires much patience and thought. Otherwise 10/10. Amazing game.",

Endurance/Health system: The endurance/health system is a system in which, instead of having one pool of life you get two, endurance and health. Endurance is the amount of 'health' you have durring combat, if it is brought down to zero you get kocked out for the fight. Health is the total pool that endurance draws from, once Health is reduced to zero you are put into a killable state, where if hit while in this state you can and will die. Mechanics such as these help take old ideas and put new and modern spins on them.   Stronghold system: Along with that there is a keep system in which you get to own a stronghold! With the keep you upgrade it, and gaurd it. Your stronghold serves as a main base of opperation in which you can rest, leave companions and do numerous other things i will touch upon later. Upgrading your stronghold allows you to get numerous different benefits, (most of which benefit the keep or you when your at it). Upgrading the keep allows you to gain presteige and saftey. The keep also serves as a front to a large well crafted dungeon which you can delve into. Along with your keep being attacked and a couple other cool minor additions.  Story/Lore: I havn't gotten that far into the story but from what I have done it has been a very well put together and solid universe with a stream of neverending lore and stories. They have a cool background idea that is well developed and looks like it will lead to an amazing story.  Quests/Side Quests: The first game I have wanted to be a completionist without feeling like it is a hassle to complete... Thats all I have to say.

A few hints for people starting out:  * Even Mages need MIGHT. MIGHT == damage. I don't get it either, but it does make this clear at character creation. * Use fast mode + sneak. Why? So you can find the hidden stuff (and not be too slow). Sneak around suspect areas. * TAB highlights the goodies... but see above. Hidden stuff won't appear via TAB until detected via sneaking. * There's hidden stuff everywhere, even in the middle of the wilderness. * Cast range is an important spell attribute. Look for little feat on the cursor to see if you need to be closer. * Guns are OP. There's no reason your wizard can't shoot one. * Always geek the mage first... and the priest. * If you sneak up to enemies then unload on them with a lot of powerful ranged weapons, the fight may end immediately.  Good spells (I forget the silly names, so will just describe the effects): * Ice fog - long range + blind * Magic missile - range + single target damage * Confusion - especially good during some bounties * Fireball - an old favorite  Regarding the pre-release bonuses: * The pig does nothing. It's a pet and you can get others in game (it's also worth nothing). * The ring is worth a pittance of gold, but it does give you 2x heal endurance on self per rest. Useful early game, likely to be eclipsed later on.",

Let's get the negative out of the way : --- completely shallow stealth system (I read the expansion will try to fix that, so let's see). -- completely shallow and immersion-breaking stronghold managemment (especially the 'stronhold' menu that just break the immersion, whereas it could have been done all by in-game interaction, without meta-game information... for god's sake, why did we need to express prestige and security in numbers, where really it's all in the role-player's imagination that's important!). -- not enough companions to ensure replayability without having to drag along characters you dislike, and ensure tactical variety (for this I guess you can say the companion creation process answers your need, but it isn't quite satisfactory for such an ambitious RPG) - combat starts to be really interesting from mid-game, but really shines in the late game, where it become altogether a game in itself.

Downside:  There are still some minor hick-ups, e.g. the often mentioned AA-Problems with cut-scenes (especially on a mac it seems) as well as that my figures often keep on running on the spot while the rest of the team stopped. Besides that it works really fluently and Obsidian already promised a fix for these first problems.  Upside:  Just clean and simple: Everything! I waited such a long time for this kind of game and though Divinity: Original Sins was also quit nice it had not this kind of combat, story and atmosphere! I do not want to compare it with wasteland 2, as both are very different in their approach and combat (though I backed Wasteland 2) - and both games together give me hope for this genre.  So for everybody who wants to play finally an in-depth RPG with great tactical combat, an gorgeous storyline and outstanding character creation/development should definitely buy this game!

In fact, of the many types of games I enjoy to play, I'm not sure RPG's are even in my top-5. Then, comes Pillars of Eternity:  For a game essentially 'built from the ground up', it far exceeded my expectations. The story is very unique and keeps your attention. The way you interact with others means endless replayability (be evil in 1 game, and noble in the next). The combat was fairly new to me. Took some time getting used to pause mid-fight to tell my companions what spell to cast or enemy to attack. Once you are used to it, you can quickly learn how to take on very dangerous enemies. And the graphics are excellent. Everyone says with a game like this 'every class has its plus and minus, but this one is better'. While true, that is a huge understatement. Each class works completely different, and although there have been plenty of arguments as to who the best 'class' is, they are all powerful in their own way. My main experience is with a Druid, Wizard and Fighter (Fighter being my favorite so far because, well, it's fun).  Overall, this is a game almost anyone could enjoy.

Also, the disengagement penalties make it so pre battle positioning matters more than the actions a player uses after the battle starts; ultimately, the game encourages save scumming and the combat feels almost pointless to take part in.  Another important problem is taht this game been plagued with unacceptable bugs, and bug fix patches that bring about new bugs since its release.

But whilst the game seems extremely ambitious with regards to it's focus on lore, detailed environment art and interesting political and ethical story plot points; it still struggles to be as entertaining as its predecessors.  Perhaps this is due to a focus in these areas to a point where the story becomes a bit too 'too smart for you' or in the extremes I had no idea what was going on at all. Combat is fun and a great throwback, but suffers from old issues like 85% of your spells being next to useless, or completely outclassed by others. Also, areas like the player base you get a few hours into the game, dungeon not withstanding, is just flat out empty and lifeless. Perhaps with a bit more focus this could have been a legendary game.   I still recommend giving it a play if you liked those old school DnD games. Just be prepared to do lots and lots and lots and lots of reading in the game that whilst cool never actually really brings the world to life. Id say this game is probably a solid 7.5/10 or so.

It is isometric and 2.5D -- the characters are 3d models and the the environments are 2D sprites -- but still is one of the artistically best games I have played. There is a special charm about the style of graphics, probably just nostalgia. The soundtrack is also very well scored.  The gameplay is an exceptional RPG set. You make a character and form a backstory and set forth on an adventure. Along the way you pick up followers and watch the world and journey unfold. As some others have pointed out the lore and dialog is very thick in this game. Most conversations can last at least the wordage of a short story. This could potentially be a turn off for less wordy people. I personally love the effort and depth in it. Combat is played real time, not turn based like Wasteland. Different character types have different combat abilities, and must utilize these abilities to be used to their full potential. It really takes a team to overcome some scenarios in this game.  I would definitely reccomend this to fans of other Obsidian titles and isometric RPG players. Personally, I think that more RPG games could take a lesson or two from games like this. Pillars of Eternity is truly a masterpiece in art and lore.",

The voice acting is great, the graphics while not triple A are still great. Art work is beautiful. Some of it is stunning. And it does not require a super computer to run.

It does so unapologetically and accurately while also bringing enough new ideas to the table to make the game more than pure nostalgia for nostalgia's sake. The underlying story and fantasy world are meticulously crafted, innovative and well written. Overall, the game is hugely successful though there still are minor issues that could be improved.   PoE doesn't rely on the old D&amp;D rules, they have their own, new RPG rule set that does use classes, spells, resting and the typical party roles we're used to (tank, healer, crowd control, damage) but otherwise has its own ideas of stat-interaction and a few new class ideas. The overall concepts will be recognizable to seasoned RPG veterans while still presenting new challenges to adapt to.   The story is a major selling point of PoE. The writing is solid, the story deep and the character (especially the eight NPCs) are very well crafted. There's a great deal of freedom in regards to how you approach different quests and even characters in the game, you have almost unconstrained freedom to murder and pillage almost any character in the game, if you so choose, for example. A criticism here could be that perhaps the story doesn't escalate tension particularly well so that when the game ends, it doesn't feel so much like a strong climax as simply a steady unraveling of an intricate plot. The game behaves mostly like the final fight is a formality and the actually interesting question isn't if you win, but what you do after you win. This can make the game seem slightly less memorable than perhaps it should be.   Arguably, there are some issues with balance that should be addressed too. Between DPS and non-DPS classes, the game becomes very fixed in its roles. Tanks find it hard dealing meaningful damage but retain the ability to tie down enemies through the game's 'engagement' system. This system simply means that if you run away from a character engaging you, that character damages you for free - however since tanks don't do meaningful damage, the AI could actually just run right past them with great advantage. It doesn't do that, luckily, but this lopsidedness arguably makes the game system feel a bit artificial at times. The spell system could also use a bit of rebalancing, certain spells serve no clear purpose in the game as you don't really have the time or the situations where they need to be cast. In most situations, dealing damage outweighs more complicated options. This said, the system actually works really well, it has genuinely intuitive ideas and I hope they continue to work on it.   All in all, PoE is a successful RPG game and follows Divinity Original Sin in reviving this wonderful genre. The crowd-funding concept definitely worked in this instance. I hope Obsidian stick to this project and release a sequel soon, they needs only address a few issues that exist still in PoE and build on the promising world behind the game.",

If you're itching for a good roleplaying experience, this title will deliver to the fullest. I'm glad I don't have a ton of free time to play it because it would easily have me hooked in for a while. Certainly seems like one of those games that you always come back to and play once in awhile when you're in the mood for playing a good game.  Easily worth the 40 dollars, though you can get it cheaper elsewhere. Its value in my opinon measures much higher than most 60 dollar games on the market, so I'd say it's a good deal. Heck I've spent more time in character creation in this game, than I've spent with some games all together.   9/10 until some minor tweaks to pathing and combat nuances are patched in. Once combat feels a tad more intuitive, it's an easy 10/10.  EDIT: Review was initial thoughts at game's release. I've jumped back into the game now that it's patched up and content complete with expansions.   It is indeed a 10/10 in my eyes. I don't play the game out of nostalgia for games like BG and NWN. Those were great games for their time, and still hold up today for people who are really interested in them. But for our current time, I believe Pillars is a better game by today's standards. It's not fair or accurate to compare today's standards with the past.  On it's own, Pillars is a great game. So much detail was put into this game. What orginially threw me off during release was the combat. Particularly no combat AI. And combat jsut seemed messy. Now with patch 3.0, the combat is much more fluid and their is party AI. Nothing like DA:O, but still helpful.   Seems pathing is better, I remember a big issue with that on release.  Lots and lots of replay value. The world is interesting, lots of classes to chose from (No dual classes though), and a good pace to game especially early on which is important. You can get a comfortable grip fairly quickly which is great if you consider multiple runs through the game.  Good amount of challenge with the difficulty settings if you like that sort of thing.  You get your own stronghold that you can upgrade and manage. Not super in-depth, but satisfying to watch it grow.  There are a lot of stats in this game. It seems overwhelming at first, but they are very simple in practice. You don't really need to memorize it all, since the game does a great job with having descriptions at the ready, for everything.  Characters are for the most part, extremely uninteresting and bland. In my opinion I have no desire to carry out their quests. Thankfully the game gives you the option to create characters for your party, including the starting stats, which from a role play and/or powergame perspective is better anyways.  Story is interesting. The whole watcher thing seems weird at first but it kind of plays into the lore of the game. The premise is pretty weak in my eyes but it fleshes out nicely. It's somewhat confusing for a little while but I guess it's supposed to be.  Lots of text. I personally prefer text instead of audio dialogue unless the voice acting is really really good like Witcher 3. There is quite a bit of voiced dialogue too, mostly just one liners and such, but also idle banter between companions now and again which I do like a lot.  Combat is incredible. There is a lot going on but you have the ability to pause at any time to issue commands. Rewards strategic thinking. On lower difficulties you can just right click to win like an ARPG, but higher difficulties will require you to put some thought into your actions.  Overall great game. Graphics, animations, audio all good. Best modern tradiitional RPG in my opinion.",

If the answer is yes, buy this game immediately. If the answer is no, buy one of those games first, fall in love, *then* come back and buy this one.  No, the game is not perfect. Combat can easily devolve into an opaque cluster of swords and sorcery. It's an Obsidian game, so there are bound to be bugs somewhere (althought I haven't found any 20+ hours in), but the story is compelling, the world is beautifully drawn and the writing is top-notch. It doesn't hold your hand, but it also doesn't have absurd expectations of the player, with lots of 'there if you want it' lore content to provide context to the story. And, despite what I said earlier, the combat and character-building systems have been streamlined effectively; players have all the options laid out for them with a clear understanding of what everything will do, so they can make informed decisions and build combat strategies to suit their preferences. That's important, because combat can be hard. If you rush into a fight without knowing what you're doing, your whole party will be down in a matter of seconds. I had to lower the difficulty twice just to get past some of the game's more challenging fights, but clearing those challenges, even after lowering the difficulty, was a highly satisfying experience.  I only have two complaints, one of which stems from the combat system: enemies seem to have a longer line of sight than the party does, so a fight will frequently lure in additional hostiles as it progresses, which I don't think was intentional and led to balancing issues more than once. Also, there are no rogue-class companions in the base game, which makes lockpicking and trap detection a real chore until the later stages if the player isn't a rogue. They fixed rectified this with the first expansion, but players shouldn't have to pay extra to add a key utility character to the party.  Overall, though, it's a beautiful love letter to a bygone era of video games. It's noteworthyfor that reason alone, and a must-have for RPG fans because it stands on its own as a wonderful game.",

Don't be fooled by similarities, however, Pillars of Eternity might look and feel like an old Dungeons and Dragons game but be ready to spend a good portion of time reading through text in order to understand the gameplay and how its systems work. If you are able to grasp the basic concepts of the combat, skill checks and dialogue choices then you will be up for an amazing time. Although I do have to point out that even if you don't have basic notions of how the old Baldur's Gate games worked, Pillars of Eternity does a good job of explaining if you have the patience for reading.  I do admit that the story of Pillars of Eternity felt very overwhelming at first, and I did not feel safe at the start with the ammount of freedom the game gives you to explore a world you barely know.
