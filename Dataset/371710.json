This game desperately is in need of a goal to reach because as of right now all you need to do is click start day, end day, and retreat keep doing that and you win. Only reason why I got this game is I wanted to get one of the most craziest and dumb game possible for my 69th game. The trailer was pretty crazy and the game was pretty dumb lol.  I really wanted to give this game a thumbs up but as it is right now I just can't nor can I recommend this for anyone to get.",

            "review_text": "This is some of the worst balancing I ever experienced. Have 0% soldiers = retreat every time or lose the game, have 20% soldies = retreat every time and have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ development in castle/people/ress. The only way to win battles is to accumulate gold and buy the hero/castle upgrades and this is only possible in late game and late game is over soon bc: Hack to win the game easily: Once you have bit of gold and levels, when your people bar is full/almost full, buy a few times the '+25% people' top up, wait a day, get 10-20 levels in one day, repeat. To get that gold is the hard thing, since all +1 gold per turn upgrades are outright improvident. I bought this game because the classic AoC doesn't run on my pc, and I'm tempted to say 1,99€ are ok, but it isn't the case sry",
