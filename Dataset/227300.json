Mundane job simulators are overwhelmingly garbage, but a select few (including ETS2) are surprisingly compelling. There is no way I can think of to describe this game without sounding terribly drab. You’re a truck driver, and are starting your own shipping company. You have to drive according to the law, take rest breaks, buy fuel, pay for upkeep. There is nothing on paper that should be exceptional about this game, yet for what it is, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is disturbingly enjoyable. I recommend everyone to give it a try.",

Though the AI can be ridiculuos stupid.  So.. you started to get a job, using company's truck. Get some money to buy your own truck so you can start building your own empire.. ehh I mean company. And then buy a garage. Buy trucks and hire drivers. Buy garages in every town. Upgrade your garages. Manage your trucks, your drivers and your garages because you're the boss.  Also, I love how the developer works on this game. Not like *ahem* unity stuff.  You will feel bored 'cause of it's repetitiveness. But sometimes, you will back to drive your trucks again. And then bored, and then drive it again, and feel bored again. And again. Overall, 9/10. Recommended for fans of driving games. Sorry for bad english, **** my grammar &lt;3",

This is the game that finally convinced me to get a 360 gamepad, and that alone was worth it, but the game itself is just fun, and relaxing too. One of my favorite moments was driving through Germany listening to a French radio station when 'Blame it on the Boogie' by the Jackson 5 came on. I'd never heard the song before, but loved it, and the mix of that song, the open road and the lovely graphics were just incredible. Totally worth your time, this game is.",

            "review_text": "Back when I had first discovered ETS2, I played the demo for hours upon hours. Starting one profile after another. Once the Multiplayer Mod was released, a friend of mine decided it might be time to actually purchase the game and see all it really has to offer.   Now, I've been playing ETS2 since roughly November 2013. But I hadn't actually had it on Steam up until March or April. I've been involved with the Multiplayer community from day one, and have put over 400 hours into multiplayer alone. But, that isn't really the topic of discussion.  So, I estimate I've put in about 200 single player hours (90% of which was off the record) and I've got to say, if you enjoy simple, relaxing, and generally stress-free gaming, ETS2 is certainly for you. I can't tell you how much fun I have going from one end of the map to the other, avoiding the sometimes clumsy Artificial Intellegence cars.   I've played around with the Vanilla version, Mods, all the while rounding some of the trickiest turns and windiest roads between Erfurt and Milano. This is, without a doubt, one of the best games I've ever played. It can take roughly two hours to get from one end of the map to another with the speed limiter on. Not to mention it's still being updated. Not too many games that were made even six months ago continue to add on more content, or even just fix little problems or exploits.   I have to give it to SCS on this one. This game is their baby, undoubtably the best game they've ever made. And they treat it as such.   Not to mention the Community. The ETS2 Community is very fond of SCS. And that is for one simple reason: They listen.   SCS listens to the suggestions given to them from within the Community, Unlike most big companies, (Not gonna name any names here... *Cough* EA *Cough*) which seem to only care about the game and it's Community for a short time. While SCS has continued to progress the developement of this game and it's Community. And believe me, guys and girls. We, the Community, notice and appreciate your efforts. So, on behalf of the entire ETS2 Community, I'd like to say Thank you.  The amount of DLC for this game is quite substantial. With the new Cargo Pack update, and a potential Rigid trucks update coming out (Nothing official, just being considered) this is shaping up to be one hell of an amazing game. SCS, you're going places, and I'll be right here when you get there.   I've been playing trucking games since the days of Hard Truck one, so I know what it takes, and what people generally want. And I'd say you've hit the nail on the head. And I know ATS is going to be flatout incredible. Happy Trails, SCS.   Keep in mind, comparing this game to current gen games is not what I intend to do. It's being rated based on it's release date, and it's updates since then.  Physics: 7/10.  Truck model detail: 10/10.  Map size: 10/10.  Texture detail: 9/10 (For it's time and what it is)  Menu layout: 10/10. It's super easy to use, and rather user friendly for new players.  Immersive aspect: 10/10. I can't tell you how many times I've started playing, and forgot I was playing a game for a bit. It's really easy to lose yourself in this game with some good music and a Radio Play or two.  Overall, I have to give this game a 9.8/10. It's fantastic, and certainly worth the money.",

            "review_text": "The best thing about this game is the experience.   I have not spent a lot of time in Europe, but I feel like I have after driving from Scotland to Hungary. You've probably read all the other reviews here and in publications talk about the experience of just slipping into some kind of 'groove'. You will be cruising down the autobahn with a load of potatoes at 3:00 AM with the radio on to some Dutch station and just lose yourself in that moment, almost as if you can roll down the window and feel the wind blow in. Those moments create immersion in a way few games can and this game will creep up on you with them. When you do make it to Milan with those potatoes you will feel like you've accomplished something.  The experience is the best part about this game, and while it's great I find myself wishing that the whole 'company management' aspect of this game was done just a bit better. It has the bare bones there, you buy trucks, hire guys, buy garages, make money, but I wish it had more depth and strategy than it does. There's enough there to make you care about hitting the road with that load of tractors or upgrading your engine, but it's not quite what it could be to make this a truly killer game.  But what is here, those 'on the road moments', is worth it.",

Euro Truck Simulator 2 is not one of them, it is strangely cathartic, engaging and relaxing. Unlike other niche games, there is a smaller barrier to entry and features a simple control scheme for newcomers. There are some reservations such as an infuriating penalty system and a lack of vehicles on major highways but these are outweighed by the positives. Overall, for the fee of 20€, I would highly recommend this driving experience even if it’s not something that would usually be on your radar.",

I've never driven a vehicle in real life, but Euro Truck Simulator knows that not everybody is skilled driver, so i can change the 'difficulty', aka just press W to go forward and S to slow/go backwards. First 50 hours, i've been driving with a keyboard. Drove about 55 thousand kilometers, then i left the game for a while because it was quite boring. But now i've made a fresh new profile, which is fun to play. Euro Truck Simulator 2 also beats Euro Truck Simulator 1, which was so boring for that money i spent on it (about 40 euro then) by several aspects  1. Graphics - ETS2 has beautiful graphics and good optimalization, so with some time spent, you can make the game playable (My setup is Intel Core 2 Duo and 650GTX for your info)  2. Features - I don't have to park at the end (much better for me, i'm lame at parking correctly, always took me like 15 mins), GPS! You don't have to check the map every 5 seconds, you always carry your GPS which points you to the end of the journey! Also the GPS has ETA time (calculated time when will you arrive), time left to ship the trailer, and other good things  3. AI - Sorry for swearing, but before 1.9, AI was total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Not because cars are flying around, but cars that driven like idiots, made me slow, waiting 5 minutes, blocking, crashing because you're lame and stuff, but after 1.9, the drivers have gotten brains so they arent driving like drugged ♥♥♥♥ers.   10/10 would play again ",

            "review_text": "This game is splendid, the genre of simulation games gets a lot of bad reputation and is generally the laughing stock. Euro Truck Simulator 2 just doesn't care and just became a really good game. If you like driving around, micromanaging your employees, or just like to mess around in simulators it is possible to do so in this.  At first I was skeptic and I bought it on impulse but at the point of writing this I have played more than 50 hours driving around Europe, every country really is a unique experience with a lot of details added to the side of the roads making you feel like you're really there. I thought it wasn't true untill I hit some areas I've been too in my past although sometimes the road was a lot shorter than in real life, it still really felt like I was there, looking around from my truck, in the mountains, over the bridges and through the forests, the view takes your breath away. If you just like traveling, this game really gives a good experience of traveling with a truck.  I really have to mention the roads, they are different everywhere, whereas in the UK you'll find a lot of roundabouts and you drive left, when you cross the pond by ship or train, you get on roads that are really specific to the countries, in the Netherlands for example you have these roads with orange browny sides that are meant for bicycle riders, in Poland you get roads that are a bit broken left and right, they are a straight contrast. Not to forget the different gasstations on the sides of the road, the tollhouses for tollroads, the bordercrossings, they all have a lot of variaty, the cities difer a lot.   The truck handling really feels, when you drive without a trailer it feels like you're weightless, you pull up so fast and you corner so nicely, put a trailer behind it and it is the opposite. Depending on the weight of the trailer, it can be really heavy, trying to get up to speed can be a drag with those weights and trying to race the corners can be a large accident, you really feel like you're heavy when you have a trailer behind you. The things you can transport also make a difference a whole lot of difference, sometimes you transport bottom heavy diggers of 25 tons and you just feel you got a lot of grip in the corners, but then the next time it is sand which is heavier in the center of height, and you go through a corner at a medium pace and you start tipping, you just know right there that the next corner you can't go as fast anymore. The difference between two trucks is also noticable, every truck is different some have a lot of horse power and torque, whereas others have barely any and need to really pull their strength to get up a hill. If you go to a garage to repair your truck you can also upgrade it and customize it, making it even better than before.  The games controls are also good, though lacking controller support, it has support for steeringwheels and joysticks. It for example does support the sticks on my controller but it does not support any of the buttons, though this can be solved with things like xpadder, it would still add a lot to the game if it had native support.  I would definitely recommend it if you enjoy trucking it really has the full experience.",

            "review_text": "Excellent game some real good mods available glad to see game on steam  Hi  Well i thought it was time to re-visit this review the original review was very brief and written in Jan 2013  Euro truck simulator 2 would have to be one of my favorite games of all time the game now has the following it deserves im glad SCS has hit the big time with this game i got this game as per-order the only per-order i had no issues with my hours are not very well reflected on steam i original had it off steam.  Graphics: Overwhelming good weather its modded and unmodded it gives off realistic feel and they are always improving them which is great to and by far the best graphics in a simulator in my mind but the great thing is they can be turned down so you can play on low end system if you wanted to me i run 3 screens and run graphics at max with no issues. Only thing i feel is missing is skid marks from brake lock up and smoke and skidding sound would be great addition.  Controls: The controls are another great feature and SCS has pretty much taking care of every one from key board and mouse to different brand wheel and pedal combos and every other variety available i currently have a simulator rig which has a Logitech G27 wheel and shifter but i run Fanatec pedals this works well with ETS2 after bit of playing around in the settings to find your comfort Zone but the load cell does make it difficult as it feels like ETS2 does not recognize it.  Game-play: Well the game-play is virtually never ending and running your own company can get very busy especially when you have alot of different drivers working for and trying to maintain there skill points trucks and delivery's plus driving yourself as well i think all in all this is a great concept with plenty of ways to play weather you want to run solo or have team of truckers working with you.  Content: how to explain this with out talking for hours the world is your oyster i guess weather you stick to SCS original game content and use there DLC which are available here on steam or you combine there DLC with the many many mods available through the many fan sites with this only it makes the game feel fresh. With mods please use a test profile as SCS does to offer support for modded games which i understand and agree with i have a test profile and my main profile my main profile is heavily modded and is my same profile from the first day i installed ETS2 which shows if your careful you can have great experience.  Physics: These are very surprising and realistic creating an accurate simulator in your home is not easy but ETS2 gives a very good sim feeling with you play on you sit in sofa or desk chair or sim rig to play you can feel every bump twist and turn with great immersion factor  Overall this is a great game i personally recommend it to any sim fan or truck fan even if its not your normal style of game i recommend trying it out its great fun.  PROS: excellent graphics, excellent controller support, excellent price, lots of content and game-play  CONS: can be difficult to find comfort zone with load cell brake pedal ,no skid marks smoke or skidding sounds",

I believe since this is a 'simulator' game, you should go deeper than what factory setting gave you. Try to use gamewheel, force feedback in this game is pretty awesome, you can tell the difference when you have goods in your back that empty trailer, if you don't have one, mouse steering still give you precision and little of the force feedback you want. every truck has it's own 'fingerprint', Volvo feed your hunger for power, rather than majestic (or should I say Mercedes) will give you god touch of driving in the city and hill. ridiculous precision of a one's brand for such simulator. Oh! don't forget to learn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ braking and engine braking. And make the rain probability slider in option to go about 40%, rain is rarely happen under that mark, and rain is awesome! try to use 'simulator' feature as many as you can, sure it'll bring you joy for fancy truck driving.  I'm not going to whiny about graphics, but since in this game all you have to do is driving, having a good view of landscape and city is a need. Graphics pretty nice, what makes me impress is ETS2 have widely variant of graphic setting. I still can have nice graphic at my GT520M at my laptop (7/10) and a perfect breeze at my desktop GTX660.  Here's a little con you'll find, not that many - sometimes when I go to the left/right, cars from opposite way of me didn't stop even after my truck body is eat up half of the road space. it's a little bit annoying to get -£400 - you cannot set how many hours you want to sleep at the truck stop, sometimes I missed the delivery time for some mission because of this. - mouse steering sucks because you can't move your head without holding RMB.  It's sure a great sim! be warned for addiction and dreaming become a truck driver.",

This game is really fun but all I'm doing is driving a truck with cargo to my destination. Driving with a controller feels really nice and this entire game feels really nice. ETS2 is also moddable but I like to keep this game vanilla because I feel there isn't much wrong with it. The huge open world is really nice, too. The addition of the radio is really nice so I can listen to my own music or music from European radio stations. There is also a management system where you can manage your own company and buy cars for your garage and send drivers out on cargo delivery missions. ETS2 is also very atmosphereic. I feel like I'm actually driving the truck and I don't want to leave. The car AI could be worked on but it works fine most of the time. ETS2 feels very polished for an indie game. And with the announcement of American Truck Simulator, now is an even better reason to pick it up. I recommend playing with headphones on and while listening to some radio stations at a lowish volume. Buy this game if you're looking for a game to play to relieve stress or try out the demo because the demo actually offers quite a bit of content and can keep you busy for a couple hours.

Although, I'd highly recommend having a music player playing music in the background as the long drives can be a bit daunting without it.  As for its down sides.. I couldn't get the built in radio player to work on Linux at all with MP3 or radio streams as is apparently supported. Not a big issue for me as I just used another media player to have music in the background.  It can also be very resource intensive also so you may need quite a beefy system if you want to wack the graphic settings up.  So to break all this down into a nice pro/cons list:  Pros:  - Very well built simulation game. Does what it says on the tin.  - Has achievements/trading cards for those who may want them.  - Cannot be simply 'beaten' in a few hours like most modern games.  - Has company management features built in allowing you to employ people, buy trucks etc etc etc.  - Trucks can be customized.  - Visually it looks amazing if your system can cope.  - Great modding community that offers many things the base game cannot.  - Multi-platform support  Cons:  - Very resource intensive mostly on the GPU and appears to only be using only 1 CPU core out of 8 on my system  - Framerate can drop in some locations for a few seconds.  - No built in multiplayer (Though can be added via unofficial mods)  - AI traffic can be pretty darn stupid at times and will happily ram you out of your lane if it wants your lane and then charge you for the privilege with a traffic fine.  Hmm, I wanted to list more cons.. but I honestly cannot think of any others. So I'm going to have to say.. yes I recommend this game :-).",

Although right now I've played only 2 hours of this game, which is an accomplishment itself, I can hardly describe the feeling of completing a job in your own truck. Seriously, the best feeling in the world is achievable through playing Euro Truck Simulator.   If you're like me, a guy with enough free time to stay up until 2 in the morning driving around in your truck, you'll absolutely adore this game.  10/10 will play again",

            "review_text": "Euro Truck Simulator 2 is just one of those games. One of those really annoying games that we all love. To not like this game is foolish, what is there not to like about it? You can launch it thinking 'I'll do one small job and get off, got homework to do' and at 10pm you are still playing it. Despite all the swearing and crying over all of the times you have crashed and got no money for any of the jobs, it was safe to say that it was time well spent.   Euro Truck Simulator 2 pretty much tells you everything about the game before you play it, but also without really telling you about the game. You are a lorry driver. You drive lorries. You get paid to drive lorries over Europe. It is a very hard game to play. No, it really isn't. Basiclly, drive, deliver your cargo and do it all over again without crashing too much. I repeat - too much. It is a challenge, but one that we all enjoy.   If you are the type that likes really fast paced killing games with blood and gore, then this game is not for you, and if you can't stop killing people, and sit back and enjoy some lovely scenery and driving, then you are not for this game. I think now we have solved that, we can talk about the game. Funny, what have i actually said about the game so far? Do you want to buy it yet? No? I need to try harder, clearly.   10/10 Driving Simulator. Lovely scenery, very well made game, plenty to do, and no time to do it in. I would reccomend this game to anyone that hates lorries and simulators. This is just your type of game.",

I play multiplayer mostly using the ETS2MP mod along with thousands of other drivers from around the world, but singleplayer is entirely great also, so whichever you prefer you won't be dissapointed.  I play using a G27 steering wheel, pedals and H-Shifter for maximum immersion, and the game is compatible with Occulus Rift and TrackIR for those that want to go even further!  I can't recommend this simulator enough, get it!  Note: This should be pretty obvious but i'll say it anyway just incase... This game is a simulation of being a truck driver, it isn't a racing sim.

            "review_text": "It takes every ounce of your energy to not take this game at face value, but is imperative to this sublime simulator that you don't. Yes, it is a game about driving trucks. Yes, the hauls get to be long distance. If you're looking for something that keeps you on the edge of your seat, with non-stop action, this is not your game.  However, if you're looking for one of the most true to life, masterfully done, in-depth simulator you've ever sunk your teeth into, you've come to the right place.  I remember joking with my buddies 'LOL who wants to drive truck'. Then a few weeks later, I find myself bored on a Saturday, lo and behold, ETS2 has a demo. I'll give it a shot, what do I have to lose? Just my entire Saturday.  I can't quite put my finger on the exact thing that kept me playing this game for an 8 hour marathon session (I had stand alone before the Steam version). Beautifully, accurately crafted European countryside is a brilliant start. I plopped my trucking company down in London, as I wanted to tour the UK. I buy my first truck, and jump right into my first haul.   Well, the minutes turn into hours, and suddenly I'm the owner of a successful trucking company, myself and 2 employees with my own fleet. As you progress, you level up and can spend points on hauling more dangerous/fragile cargo, longer hauls, more economic hauls (gas/wear and tear), and more. As your employees complete more hauls, they also level up and start bringing in more cheddar.  My only gripe are the punishment systems. I was expecting active traffic police, aka being pulled over for breaking the law. However, the only punishment system is a series of fines. A fine for running a red light, for driving in the wrong lane, for hitting other cars, and traffic cameras (which I'm told are quite common in Europe) for speeding. No lost time in accident investigation or being pulled over, just a popup fine.   The only other punishment system is a damage system to your truck and trailer. Damaging the trailer results in a poor score for the haul, and damaging your truck ends up costing you hefty repair bills. It's also worth mentioning that it seems you get to a point where you make enough money that any punishment is negligible. You make enough money on the haul where a few $500 tickets don't phase you, nor does a small repair.  This game is a perfect getaway when you're looking for a lazy escape. Throw on your favorite tunes, and get to haulin'. ETS2 gets a 4/5.  Apocky+Tawok  www.GuildLeaders.com ",

It's hard to believe a trucking simulator is as fun as this. I can't believe I'm giving this a 10 out of 10! Anyways; let's start with the pros shall we? So, you start off at the very bottom of the totem pole. You have 0 trucks, you don't have anyone working for you, and you don't have a home garage. (Although you do have a home city that you can pick) You have to do odd little jobs to save up enough money and reputation so that the bank notices you. Once they notice you, you can pull out a loan. With the loan you can buy your own truck and start doing better and more lucrative trucking jobs. Throughout the whole game you are upgrading your stats which allow you to drive farther, haul hazardous material, drive longer distances, haul urgent deliveries, and so on and so forth. Once you gain enough money, you can buy your own garage, and upgrade it. When you have a garage, you can hire others to drive for you. Now, this doesn't mean you can stop driving, but they will start to earn a nice chunk of change. (And you can control what type of cargo they haul)  Now, on top of all of this; this game accepts mods. There are a TON of mods for this game; both user created and professionally created. Some of the mods are horrendous and will crash the game; however some of the mods are extremely useful and make the game a million times more fun. Right now, with my game, I have over 200 different loads I can carry at any given time and I can travel thousands of kilometers. (Then again, everything on mine is maxed out) This is not a game you will beat in one setting, in one day, or even in one week. This is a nice relaxing game to play.  Since I did the pros, I'll do the cons. (Which don't affect my rating because they don't matter much to me) You don't have any damage simulation. Well, you do and you don't. It's a partial simulation. If you damage your truck high enough you will have a tough time driving it as the engine will stall out on you. However, you won't notice any physical damage to your truck. It's all internal and nothing cosmetic will actually show. (Even the AI cars won't show damage when you hit them) Other than that big one, there aren't too many cons. Each person is different though.  I personally recommend this game to anyone into simulation games and anyone who is interested in trucks. You will not be let down.",

Well, now I'm here eating my own words because this is one of my favourite games of all time. The concept is so small and drab but the execution is excellent and the appeal is abundant. I've always been a fan of Tycoon games and ones that involve money/time management and the general growing of a business. In ETS2, you have to work your way up from a rookie driver doing local deliveries to a pro driver who is trekking across europe in the truck of his choice.  The game is realistic, with great sounds and amazing physics. There are so many customisable options that add great depth. Driving is a joy and it really feels like you have your own job in trucking. But best of all, you're free! This is the PERFECT game to settle down, relax, put some music on and just drive and think. It's truly amazing and that's the appeal I referenced earlier.  So, to conclude, don't judge the book by its cover! Give this gem a go if you see it on sale because I promise you, it will not disappoint! Easily one of my top 5 games ever.",

The landscapes you are driving in are beautiful. Their is traffic, weather, and everything you would expect to experience on the road. If my memory serves me correctly, there are also numerous options to control the frequency of rain and things of that nature.  There are numerous upgrades you can obtain for your driver to haul better cargo and make more money, as well as numerous trucks you can buy. You're also able to hire staff, but I have yet to progress that far into the game.  This game is definitely something to try if you have any interest in simulation games.

As an older gamer in my mid 30's I remember a time when Simulator games were pumped out ten a penny, sure they were mostly 'war machine' sims such as aircraft, tanks or submarines and every system had them from the early 80's wireframe Spectrum 48k efforts right up until the naughties full on 3D rendered apachie v havok (00's) but then with the advent online consoles the quality of sims died off in a big way.  Sure we still had a few knocking special ones knocking around, the silent hunter series and microsofts lacklustre (should have been better) combat flight sim series, but most companies now focused on giving us standard cookie cutter clones of console games year after year.  The past few years have however given us a newlease of sim games some great some not so but all withing their rights beautiful, from the oddly popular farming simulator to the even odder goat simulator were now being treated to some proper PC sim love from gaming studios.  And so eventually we come to Euro Truck Simulator 2 or ETS2 to its fans.  Gamers can now live out their dreams as an EU based trucker, buy a truck, pick a job, drive for miles across international borders while avoiding speeding tickets and dodging crap motorway drivers and dodgy AI (since launch AI is vastly improved), its that simple, thats all their basically is to it.  The games engine isnt the best looking by far but its nice enough to look at for hours on end and trust me, you will look at it for hours on end, and the community have taken to the game nicely so theres lots of modding available, from new trucks and trailers, updated true to life road markings and signs for respective countries, a working radio station mod and even an ad hoc multiplayer mode that actually works.  The game plays well, the trucks handle nicely and theres a nice progression system that allows you to form a fleet of trucks of your own and send out AI drivers to complete jobs, theres a good chunk of customisability to your trucks from new paint jobs to lights, wheels, engines ect.  This all may sound pretty boring and in reality it should be, and yet it isnt, its somehow compelling and extremly satisfying as your make sure you slow down for the speed cameras on the M6 en route to Manchester to ensure you dont get a ticket as you run against the clock to get your load of supermarket goods delivered on time..  It has that fully engaging 'SIM-iness' that all great Sims have, its not ultra realistic as Sims go but it has enough that you feel engaged and has enough addictive quality that keeps you playing and coming back..

My grandfather's father was a trucker in Northern Finland during WWII; he freighted machine parts for the Swedish Airforce and supplies to the German troops stationed in Lapland during the war and was even bombed once by Soviet bombers so he had to hide under his truck. My father drove in Norway's icy mountains where the roads were so deadly that you needed snow chains to not fall off the cliffs and the summers were so hot that his tires were boiling when he came down the mountain. My brother drives to Italy and Spain and sends me texts from the top of the Alps, from Paris or the Mediterranean and pictures of Vesuvius and tells me how beautiful the Spanish women are and stuff. Personally, I couldn't even complete the tutorial in Euro Trucker.  10/10 Would feel like the family black sheep again.",

In general I probably have racked around 100 hours on this game.   This game is really interesting to me. Usually people like games similar to GTA or Need For Speed, which I do like as well, but I also like simulators, like this one. They can really teach you how a lot of the things work, and how to properly drive, check your mirrors, etc.. The tasks are pretty simple. Choose a quick job, drive from point A to B. Along the way you may run crash, run out of fuel, or you may just end up with a traffic ticket. You are able to create your own company, but you don't really have the necessary funds from the beginning of the game in order to buy a truck, a garage, or hire workers. So in all reality, you have to grind out all of the quick jobs in order to even get to that point. Time consuming, sure, but along the way it becomes a second nature to you.  Customization for trucks is great. I believe there are paint job DLCs, which I find to be really nice! Makes your truck stand out from the others and be something unique. You can change basically anything on your truck, from the engine to the transmission, and even the cosmetic stuff, like mirrors, wheels, and much more. Lots of reputable truck manufactuers are present in the game, such as Scania, Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, and many others. The choices are great. Trailers have a good amount of variety as well, and there are a lot of weight differences in them as well.. which is very important.  I would honestly give this game a 8/10. Since it's a huge open world game, a lot of the cities look very similar. I'm sure it's necessary to due that to make it run smoothly and to keep everything working properly. I'm really excited and interested to see what else will be added to this game.. I'd also like to add that the creators of ETS2 are going to release American Truck Simulator next month (at the time this is being written) so that is also something else to keep an eye out for.",

            "review_text": "  'When the seagulls follow the trawler it's because they think sardines will be thrown into the sea.' ~ Hillary Clinton    It's one of them quiet days again. Chillin' in your methlab office, countin' your daily income. Your people downstairs are cookin'. Your boy Jaykwon standin' by the door with a shotgun. Nothin' happens.  But then, the hell breaks loose.  'LAPD, FREEZE MOTHAFUKKAS!' Shieee, man muthafukkin 5-0 stormin your joint. Your guys grab their pieces and start firing at the police. Gunshots all over the place. First few cops get shot but unfortunately your guys are goin' down cuz shieee, they ain't nuthin' more than a bunch of niqqaz, nahmean?   *BAM BAM*   a cop breaches your door and gets inside aiming at you but your boy Jaykwon caps his ♥♥♥ and wounds a guy who followed him. Wounded cop drops his MP5 but draws his sidearm and guns your boy Jaykwon down. You pull your .44 from the drawer and commit 187 on that fukker. ♥♥♥♥♥ is goin' down so you use the zipline and roll down to the hidden garage where you hid your dirtbike and make a run for it.   *KABLAM*   the charges that you planted for this exact situation go off, blasting all the pigs inside. You reach your emergency plane and fly to Argentina where you live, disguised as a TV repairman until one day you get shot by your own son whom you abandoned 30 years ago.  Now, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is nothing like that.  Basically this is a driving RPG. You start as a low grade G with no truck, no rep, no woman, no money, no nuthin' and then you drive. And you drive long and hard until you get money. Then you invest that money. And, if you're lucky, one day instead of working for the money, money will work for you. (Well, you could get a loan from the bank but not only the jewish bankers will penetrate your goy butt but it's also more fun to earn the money yourself).  Now I know what you guys are sayin 'Niqqa, how is that fun? U high?' Well for some reason it is fun. Routes look pretty nice and kinda believeable, graphics are aight, trucks and their cockpits look good, you can install mods if you wish, you can listen to actual radio stations from all across the Europe n ♥♥♥♥♥.  I said that it's an RPG because, except of fines, there is no punishment for not following the rules, speeding, ignoring the red lights and ♥♥♥♥♥. You can't really interact with the drivers you hire, business management is rather simplistic (I hire only blonde girls without even looking at their stats and i'm doing just fine), and the only place where you can see your empire grow are the charts. But the point of the game lays in the role playing. Using your blinkers, watching your speed, minding the trailer while taking narrow turns, taking satisfaction from buying new trucks, hiring new drivers and watching them making money for you. I would hardly call this a 'simulator' but it does a splendid job being an RPG.  There are some downsides too like:  - The cities look aight but they are very small with just some landmarks visible in the distance. - There are no roadside ladies of the night in a game about   driving trucks   (which is especially unrealistic for eastern Europe). - Streets in the cities look empty in general. - Even if you choose to be a black character at the start, your in-game model is a white dude. Racist. - You can't get off your truck to beat the ♥♥♥♥♥ out of AI drivers and I would really, really love that feature. - Some regions, in my opinion, are not as well made as other.  I would reccommend using a steering wheel or a pad, but the game plays surprisingly well with mouse + keyboard. I would also strongly reccomend getting the 'Going East' DLC    which in my opinion should be free but watchu gonna do? Money talks I guess.     Overall, it's an alright game, definitely worth trying.                         THE FUKK YOU LOOKIN AT, HOMEBOY? GO AND BUY THIS GAME   NOW  , SHIEEEEE...",

It will let you get in touch with how it feels to be a truck driver - at least I guess.  The following experience let me take the time to write this review:  Just accomplished my trainings contract - not a big deal.  Then I was free to pick my first 'real' contract myself. I drove my truck safe and sound out of the parking lot right to the freeway. I concentrated on driving well, keeping on track, making no mistakes and - for christ's sake - having no car accident, because the costs will be substracted from your contract money and damaging your truck or cargo will be bad as well. So I drove carefully and had a close look on the street.  When i looked back to my GPS navigation system I realized i had missed the exit ramp. 'F***!' tried to be cool and looked for the next possible even though not legal way to turn around and get back on track in time - because contracts are time bound. I reversed and *bang*! First crash - 400€ substracted from my contract. -.- I didn't try to reverse and turn around anymore but rather looked for a legal way to turn and get back on track safely. I took the next exit, turned my truck, got back on track, but then a car drove into my truck. Technically not my fault - although to be honest it was my fault - so no 400€ substraction. Thank god! But wait... I checked my cargo and truck damage status and realized... my cargo has been damaged by 1% -.- 'All right then, f*** it!' I thought to myself. I pulled on my ingame radio (game let you search and find real internet radio), got myself a cold beer (not ingame) and pretended to be king of the street from then on - no matter the costs!",

Glad I didn't pass it up as the game is superb and is HIGHLY addictive. I've had the game since Thursday now and I've already put in a good amount of hours.  The game is massive. You start off as a driver for hire in a city of your choosing, and you choose jobs to build up money (or just take out a bank loan if you're impatient) to get your own truck to start up your own business. You can choose from DAF, Scania, Iveco, Volvo, and more, for your trucks, you can hire drivers, buy more trucks, buy other depots...all the things you can do in a real life truck business you can do in this game.  The actual driving part of the game is VERY realistic and the game does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're driving a truck. You drive at night, through the day, in the rain, when it's sunny, have to take a break every 10 hours or so....honestly, it's very realistic to real life trucking.

For playing offline there are some other excellent free mods available including trucks, trailers and maps, although none of these (except officially released) are compatible with the multiplayer mod. I found the game difficult to play with the keyboard, so got a Logitech G27 wheel and pedals to play and makes the game so much easier to play and more enjoyable.

During a sales week I've clocked in over 10 hours of play, and while that may not sound like much, that is during a sale week; I play everything I buy these days. That is more than 9 hours more than most sim games I've got. I just keep playing, driving about Europe delivering Ice-cream from Berlin to Swansea. WHY IS THIS COMPELLING? It's pure mystery. It is pure occult mysticism. Do not question it, do not fight it, do not oppose it. Embrace the truck addiction and join us join us join us join us beep beep join us join u... OH GOD DAMNINT!

I was not expecting to play much more than about 10 hours in this game, but so far I have managed 39 hours &amp; still enjoying it.  You start off doing quick jobs until you have enough money to purchase your own truck &amp; start doing the freight market which is much more profitable.  You can purchase different trucks &amp; upgrade different elements such as the chassis, engine, interior and the look of the truck. You can visit the paint shop to customise the exterior. It includes most of the manufacturers such as Volvo, Scania, Iveco, Man, Daf &amp; Renault.  There is a management aspect to the game where you can employ drivers who will then start earning more money for you. You can expand your trucking empire by purchasing more depot's.  The driving is fun &amp; handles as I would expect a truck to. The roads can be challenging &amp; include a variety of junctions &amp; road types to keep it interesting. I have mine setup with a Logtiech G27 which makes the experience much more involving. You have to haul various load types of loads to different European cities. The cities are representative of the cities but not an exact replica, so don't expect them to look like your local roads. Once you get to the destination you have the challenge of reversing your trailer in to the bay, which take a bit of practice. You can use a quick park if you find this difficult as the cost of XP points.  The game also has a large modding community to make the game more realistic such as physics &amp; branded trailers.  If you like driving games &amp; you feel like a change then give Euro Truck a try.",

            "review_text": "Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the greatest truck driving simulator, and possibly even the best simulator in general of all time. The game, even without any expansion packs is filled with content to the point of exploding. SCS Software made this game, it is the best game to own if you enjoy driving and owning or managing a business.  The trucks that you drive are based off of real trucks driven in real life. Truck companies like Iveco, Daf, Volvo and Scania all exist and not only that, but the models used in the game to resemble these trucks are extremely realistic in both sound and looks. All the trucks in the game are heavy and makes you feel like you’re actually driving a truck as opposed to driving a weightless car, there are penalties to speeding in this game besides getting a speeding ticket, but you could drift and slide unintentionally around the place and damage your truck's engine, suspension and more, whilst also damaging the cargo your delivering. Every truck shop you come across has more than one truck available for purchase, not even three, some shops have around six or seven. Each of those trucks have their own quirks and even that's not enough, not by a long shot, you can customize your truck with paint jobs, lights and even replace the 250hp engine for something with a more kick like a 500hp engine.  The map you play on is the most expansive map in any simulator, with what looks like over 100 roads to drive on, each with their own speed limits and occasionally road works, driving around this game is like a tourist drive in a tank. England not big enough for you? There are train tunnels and boat ports to carry your truck and cargo across the water and continue you on your way around Europe. If this isn't a big map with lots to see and drive on, I don't know what is.  Next is the tycoon part of Euro Truck Simulator 2. It's tough working your own company with you being the only employee, so you can hire other people and buy garages. All across Europe are cities (smaller than real life but even that doesn't ruin anything) and almost all of have a garage that you can buy with slots for vehicles, trucks available for purchase and a recruitment agency from which you can hire truck drivers to earn you some cash, or drive around looking for work and actually cost you money. But that's business.  The AI in Euro Truck Simulator 2 are fairly smart, not super smart as they do tend to drive and stop in front of you about 30cm away when you’re trying to do a U-turn. But that actually makes it realistic because anyone who drives in real life knows that you can't trust other people driving cars, some people are idiots and that's exactly what the AI in this are like. There is even a realistic bank to which you can get a loan for a quick cash injection and pay it back with interest. Pick the amount you want wisely because if you ask for a lot at the very beginning of your game, you'll find out that you will never pay it back.  All things considered, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the greatest simulator of all time. Customization, driving, jobs, realism, expansion packs, AI and so much more. There is so much to do and all in one game by SCS Software. I myself have played the game for a long time, longer than my steam account says since I owned the game on disk, later buying it on steam because this is a game worth spending the money for, twice.  I rate this game 10/10. But only because when you rate out of 10 you can't go to about 100, where it deserves to be.",

And thats a part of the problem, that it takes a long time to get anywhere. You loose money really easy too, when people drive into your car, which is really irritating, because you pay the fine. I recommend this game anyway, but I think you will enjoy it if you:  1: Are a real truck driver  2:Like driving games  3: Have a lot of time on your hands.  + Good graphics + Good sound and also radio + Feels like you are a real truck driver + A lot to do  - Takes a long time to get anywhere - Some irritating problems - Not every country in Europe :( - Sometimes too realistic  Total rating: 7,5/10",

I need to try this with the Oculus Rift one day as it looks like the perfect kind of game for such a device. however for now, a steering wheel with a cup holder is a great idea when playing.

Glad I didn't pass it up as the game is superb and is HIGHLY addictive. I've had the game since Thursday now and I've already put in a good amount of hours.  The game is massive. You start off as a driver for hire in a city of your choosing, and you choose jobs to build up money (or just take out a bank loan if you're impatient) to get your own truck to start up your own business. You can choose from DAF, Scania, Iveco, Volvo, and more, for your trucks, you can hire drivers, buy more trucks, buy other depots...all the things you can do in a real life truck business you can do in this game.  The actual driving part of the game is VERY realistic and the game does a fantastic job of making you feel like you're driving a truck. You drive at night, through the day, in the rain, when it's sunny, have to take a break every 10 hours or so....honestly, it's very realistic to real life trucking.  I cannot think of a negative thing to say about this game, so if you love trucks and you love SIM games then this HAS to be on your list. You will not regret it.",

Personally I play it with a Logitech Driving Force GT in Real Automatic mode since my wheel doesn't have a gearbox or clutch which I'm sure would make it much more fun. With or without mods, you will sure have fun. Just as long as your PC can run it that is.",

            "review_text": "Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a game that you will either love or hate. Personally, I love it. I first started playing SCS's trucking games with the 18 Wheels of Steel series. A friend gave me a copy of American Longhaul and it got tossed on the shelf as I thought I would have no interest in it. A few months later I decided to install it and after half an hour of play I was hooked. I then went on to put many hours into all the games in the series.  I received ETS 1 in a bundle one day and set it aside to play at a later date, but I never got around to it. Then one day a friend of mine told me he had bought ETS 2 after playing my copy of ETS 1 through my shared library. He was one guy that I thought would not enjoy a truck driving simulator (in fact he originally ribbed me about playing 18WOS), so I was surprised when he started raving about it. That was enough for me to buy the game and all the DLC.  Once again, I am hooked on a trucking simulator and it is great. ETS 2 is leaps and bounds above all of the previous efforts by SCS, both in terms of visuals and gameplay. There is still the problem of braindead AI drivers, but that is something you will learn to anticipate and it does not become such a problem after a while. The visuals are stunning, you just have to look at some of the screenshots to see how pretty this game is, and the truck models are fantastic. All of the trucks feel different when you drive them and you will soon find your favourites and those that you loathe to drive.  With the addition of mods, especially some of the map mods available, the replay value of the game increases. There is even a multiplayer mod that regularly sees thousands of people on some of the servers. It is quite a sight to see hundreds of people lined up trying to get into Europort.  The game is also linked to the  World of Trucks  [www.worldoftrucks.com]  website which offers external contracts, events, and more. The site is only alpha at the moment, but with the imminent release of  American Truck Simulator  I can see more features being revealed.  As I said this is not a game for everyone, but if you like simulators and you like trucks then you will probably like this. As for whether to purchase or hold of for ATS, I would recommend buying this and then also ATS when it is released.  5/5",

I spent hours just cruising around the highways, at times going for so long without a rest stop that my character began falling asleep.  There's something oddly intoxicating about Euro Truck Simulator 2. Visually, it's an impressive game. You'd expect the environments to be boring and repetitive, but they're not. Everything has a unique vibe and you can clearly distinguish industrial districts from the more rural ones.  There's really not much else to it. You need to play it to understand why it's entertaining. I suggest getting some of the mods that make the map bigger, though, since after a while driving from Dijon to Paris gets tedious.",

I often spend hours at a time completing one delivery after another.   On top of being able to drive yourself, you can hire AI drivers and build your own trucking company by buying garages in one of the many different cities.   THERE IS ALSO A MULTIPLAYER MOD. Works wonders, and only requires that you follow their simple set of rules to be allowed to play with up to 2000 other drivers on the same map!   Update: Seems that SCS is still updating this game and adding new content. It's insane how the community mods influence the game, and I've had a lot of fun connected to the World Of Trucks system completing additional contracts. Typically they're heavy long hauls, but it pays great. I honestly have to say this is the best game simulation game I've played to date.",

Joystick controls are particularly tricky and need a serious reduction in sensitivity for it to become playable. I gave up on joystick and prefer the keyboard / mouse combination.  This game is not for everyone, as those who do not love trucking and driving as much as I do may consider this game somewhat monotonous. I find it relaxing to listen to the music I have copied into the Truck Simulator music folder and cruising the streets of Europe while making money and saving up for a more decent truck. I have just taken up a loan from the bank to buy a truck and a number of new and better paid jobs came up in the list.

Furthermore, it is really relaxing, when I don’t want to play anything else I usually play this game or American Truck Simulator. All what you need to do is just drive by the rules of the road, the deadlines for deliveries usually allow for driving without a particular hurry. While doing that you can admire the world around you, which has some really stunning views especially in Scandinavia DLC. All of this combine into this relaxing and “zen” experience.  The game is still supported and patched, SCS said they are delivering same game engine patches as for American Truck Simulator, which is their newer game developed on the same engine. Not abandoning their older game after newer one has been released is a behavior of a game developer that should be supported. Furthermore there are tons of mods (including new trucks, maps, truck parts, loads, trailers, traffic and just about anything you could think of), some of them just are not on the Steam workshop, but you can easily download them outside the Steam. My favorite are trailer and traffic packs by Jazzycat, trucks by RJL and Ohaha, ProMods map and others, I really cannot mention here all the good mods that exist for this game. The game has even a mod loader that makes installing and running mods really easy. The support for steering wheels and gamepads is really good in my experience.  The most often valid complaint about the game is that it still does not support newer versions of DirectX. The AI sometimes does stupid things. But these really are not major problems. In case you are wondering do you need a steering wheel for this game my answer is you don’t but it makes the experience much better. The game is not hardcore simulation, it still has some gamey elements (for example some pneumatic systems of trucks are not simulated, you cannot buy your own trailers, etc.), but it is done to strike a balance between playability and simulation that would be most enjoyable.   If you are considering buying this game, I recommend getting “Scandinavia” and “Going East” DLCs, these add many interesting roads to drive through. All the rest DLC (at the time of writing this review) is purely cosmetic so you do not really need it.  Usually I recommend a game for a group of people that it best suits, but this is almost a universal recommendation from me. If you are a fan of driving or simulation games you should be already owning it. If you are not into simulation games, but you never really tried playing one this might be the one to try, especially on sale because you can get it ridiculously cheap then.",

The next day they may want to move from Paris, France to Stockholm, Sweden and they may repeat this cycle for weeks on end; in other words, this simulator is a game that is addictive and relaxing for anybody.  The simulator comes with excellent graphics and gameplay, the feeling of driving an actual truck is there but not all the way there. When driving a truck, your body can feel the vibrations and movement which is not replicated in this simulator, even with a steering wheel. Furthermore, no simulator can be too large. This game misses out on a lot of important details and sections of Europe itself, mainly focusing on the Western European countries as opposed to the Eastern European countries such as Russia.  The game also accepts various mods and outside content to be implemented into the game, making for a better experience depending on what the content is. It could be a graphics upgrade, additional trucks, better lighting - anything which makes Euro Truck Simulator 2 feel more approachable by it's users, having the ability to perform actions which they wouldn't in numerous other games. The idea that users can share their mods with others on various forums makes for an excellent community spirit.  Despite having minor problems which could be described as rather petty problems made on my behalf, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is the greatest simulator to date and I encourage all readers to play this game and enjoy it.

However, there is one thing that I don't particularly like (which is probably the only major thing I'd criticize about this game), and this is how freeway exits are built in the game. Most of them do not resemble how they are built in the real world at all and for a good reason. Every so often I find myself taking a wrong turn only because I did not realize on time that I had to change lanes to not exit the freeway. Other than that, it is a really nice game. It is also great to have Linux support. Works well even on rather low-end Intel onboard graphics.",

This is due to the fact that the G25/G27 has both force feedback, and a separate gear stick. Without these, the game would feel a little 'flat'. So, if you have one of these wheels, or a wheel that has a gear stick and force feedback, it really a must buy. Also, the introduction of Multiplayer (unofficial) makes this game a pleasure to play with friends, and the online community is bustling.",

In this game, you run your own start-up company, transporting different goods from city to city. Eventually you build up your company enough to the point where you can buy yourself a truck, expand your garage, hire employees and buy them trucks as well.  This game has really taught me to be disciplined and patient on the road, no matter how badly EuroGoodies needs their cheese or Tree-ET needs their forklifts. You'll get there eventually.  Pros: Fun and Relaxing Game! Running your own business is quite fun! Beautiful graphics, if you have the computer for it. Really fun once you get into the thick of it! Once you have levelled up your driver, the capabilities you have when driving are a lot less limited. Lots of cities, especially a lot more with the DLCs.  Con: Speeding tickets everywhere, even if you are barely above the speed limit. I get a lot of these tickets in the UK, maybe they just hate me.  As I said in the beginning, this is a great casual game. It's fun and relaxing. Perfect for getting away from games that can leave you stressed such as CS:GO or another rather competitive game. This game helped me relieve stress.  If you love driving, running a business, Europe, or just a casual experience, you'll probably love this game.  It just happens that I am a fan of all of these.  9/10.",

Now being a trucker and delivering trailers to point A to point B will come dull sooner or later. Now don't get me wrong there is plenty to do in base game, like building your own transport company. But driving on highway just starts to repeat itself at some point.   Now good dlc expansion would give you a some new challenges and game mechanics to keep you interested, lets say few like, left hand driving, (but thats already in base game) slippery snow roads, or double trailers that they use in Scandinavia.   But going east expansion is just a more stunning look scenery next to your multi-lane road, and everything interesting is not included in Scandinavia expansion.  So I can't recommend expansions, if you are starting to get bored and wondering would expansion give some new juice to your loved game. But if you are still happy to truck, then why not, they look good or even stunning.",

It creates a very satisfying experience out of something that you would at first believe to be boring.  First of all, the game looks good. The sounds compliment this and, if you're getting tired of listening to the roar of your engine as you roam the roads of Europe, you can play your own MP3s from your computer through the in-game radio. Even better is the ability to stream internet radio stations through the in-game radio, which, when I first discovered, I was very pleased about it!  So what do you do in ETS2 exactly? Well, you can start off working for other trucking copmanies, taking valuable cargo from point A to point B, earning some money and experience points along the way. Once you start earning enough money (or decide to get a loan from the bank), you can then purchase your own truck instead of using other people's vehicles, allowing you to earn more money and even more EXP. EXP is what allows you to 'level up', which gives you skill points that you can allocate to various different skills, e.g. improved eco-driving or being able to take jobs that involve fragile cargo (better-paying jobs).  With the rest of the money you make, you can buy more trucks, upgrades/paint for said trucks, and most importantly employees who will work for you (and garages to place them in). Soon enough, you will be running the best trucking business in all of Europe, which is ultimately the aim of this game (to build up your business and have fun doing it!).  But what is the actual driving aspect of the game like, you might ask? Well, as I said before, you drive cargo from point A to point B and earn money whilst doing so. This may sound tedious and boring, but what makes it such a grand experience is a) the scenery (as you drive through a scaled-down version of Europe), b) the excellent vehicle physics and mechanics, and c) what you do with it all: are you going to play seriously, making sure to follow all road rules and never commit a speeding offence? Or are you just going to play casually, listening to your internet radio stations and free-roaming Europe without any cargo at all? Or perhaps you'd like to muck around with some friends on multiplayer (requires a mod), crashing into things and having fun doing it?  ETS2 is truly a magnificent experience that seems to offer little yet offers so much! I thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and will most likely revisit it in the future. All I can say is this: if you want to drive around Europe in a truck, earning money and buying trucks as you do so, this is the game for you. And if you're skeptical, trust me, I was too. After playing it, though, I can tell you I had no regrets with it.  Enjoy! :)",

After reading reviews and got it as part of a humble bundle, gave it a try and I *gasp* enjoy driving the semis all over. However, it is probably more fun with a steering wheel. I also really like the managerial aspect of it and leveling up my company and expanding. What probably makes it fun is that my bf plays it at the same time and we compete with each other to see who can level and expand faster than the other.",

            "review_text": "Wow! I never thought in a million years this would be a title for me. I am embarrassed to admit I really enjoy this game. :)  You know what? This is more fun than most racing games. (explosion, whaaaaaaat???!!!!)  Well, how about no frustration, stress, monotonous scenery and bad realism. This games makes you feel calm, good and is truly a realistic simulator. You get more involved with your thoughts, it is even quite meditative.  When I first heard about this game, I thought: 'this game is definitely not for me. Perhaps for a nerd with a weird obsession about trucks. It just sounds like the most boring game ever. I mean just driving around a truck...?'   But after hearing more and more from reviewes, even from some that I regard highly, I decided to give the demo a try. Then it was dirt cheap during the sale...  Why I like it:  -Your 8 year old that always wanted to drive a truck gets all (s)he wanted gets to live again.   -The game runs great on most machines, and still looks great. Highly detailed.  -Real looking, beautiful and versatile ares.  -Realistic mechanics, but not frustrating to master. You actually get better at the game with no handholding.  -The game does not feel like a quick cash-in that so many simluators nowadays do. The game is well done.   -This game is also about running a business which is fun too.  -It is really satiesfying and calming to drive. (quite a surprise actually). It feels quite meditative, not boring at all.   -Radio. You either add your own favorite radio, or you listen to audiobooks. Fantastic.  -Weather. You feel quite snug in your truck while the weather thunders outside.  -Mods. Not really necessary, but why not? More stuff.  What I don't like:  -I don't want to admit to anyone I like this game. The least to my family... ;)  It works totally fine with mouse and keyboard. But I highly recommend a controller, or even better, a wheel for smoother driving. Make sure you go through the controller and game setup thouroghly. There are quite a few options to make the game suit your style - this is very good. You might find the game more enjoyable if you do. I imagine this game will be absolutely fantastic on a three monitor setup, and someone mentioned 3D works really well too. The immersion... I don't have this, but still enjoy the game.  Get it on a sale.",

You can work for other people to afford a truck, then you can buy your own truck, customize it, get better parts for it, you can hire a driver, then give them your truck, while you work for other people to afford a new truck for yourself.   The drivers level up as they go on missions themselves, giving you a bigger income. There's a huge truck market letting you choose from all types of different trucks. Including DAF, MAN, Ivedo, Renault, Majestic, Scania and Volvo. There's DLC letting you go all the way to poland, and most of Europe. It has all these different kinds of simulation like air brake - pressure simulation, fatigue simulation.... You need to refuel as well as stop every now and then to doze off for a bit. There's fines for going past red lights, there's speed cameras, there's damage to your truck, even though it doesn't show all the bulks and damage, you nearly CAN'T drive it when it's more than 70% of damage. The vechicles feel HEAVY, and that is the best thing! Also, remember to turn off the speed limiter that doesn't allow you to go past 90 km/h or 60 mph. Then it just gets really fun ;)",

When you first start out in the game it may only take you five minutes to finish a delivery, but that wont last forever! When you get to, lets say level 25, it may take you about a half an hour to fourty-five minutes to finish a delivery!

The game world is detailed and very accurate. Follow traffic laws to avoid getting slammed by fines, and well.. avoid slamming into things as well, because the consequences of bad driving can deal a serious blow. Haul cargo across Europe's varying landscapes and bustling cities, listen to the radio (which are actual live streamed radio stations from Europe), or listen to your own tunes. Personally, I feel this game can really help you relax and unwind. Try the demo out first (about 4-5 hours of gameplay), and just sit back and drive.",

It's not much a 'simulator' in the exact meaning of the word, i'd say it's more a simulator adaptation for everyone to enjoy and not only die hard fans.   Playing Euro Truck Simulator you drive all around a stylized Europe, from country roads to highways, mostly pleasurably detailed and with the precision of signs and traffic laws you'd expect from a simulator.  What I found a bit annoying were strange intersections (you will never find intersections that take a lane away), not being able to refill in towns (every real town has at least a gas station), lack of content for non-central Europe states (you cannot go to Sicily for example)  On the other end I really liked the AI of other cars/vans/trucks, they mostly react like human drivers would to unforeseen events.   EDIT: In recent free updates (following the release of the new 'Scandinavia' expansion) the whole graphics got a huge rework and since most concerns of my previous review were about the 'poor' graphic implementation, they are all gone. The game now looks fabulous with no impact on performance (actually if feels even better). The developers also solved a few issues so that the game is more realistic and even more a pleasure to be played.  While before the 'Scandinavia' expansion this game for me was a little more than 7/10 now it's definitely 9/10. Good job SCS Software. Recommended to everyone able to use a PC.",

It's always 'just one more job'. And it's 4 am. And you have to get up in three hours.  'Just one more job'.   There's something mesmerizing about driving a truck, loaded with cargo, from one city to another. You turn on the radio, go into cruise control and keep an eye on the road. Time flies, Getting jobs done is rewarding, you get cash that you can invest in a new truck or building your empire, which means hiring drivers and getting trucks for them. Your AI drivers will look for jobs and level up, developing their skills in the process.  Starting your career is a slow process, so this game surely isn't something for the impatient among you. Also, there's not much happening. You just drive. Sometimes you need to brake or turn, but aside from that, there's not much stress.  But you keep spending countless hours playing it, I just don't understand this phaenomenon.  Oh, and the user interface is superb. Self explanatory and logical, very well done.  The graphics are nice, but you won't have much time to admire the views. They don't put much of a strain on your graphics card, so the game should run well on older computers.  So, do I recommend ETS2?  Yes, definitely. It's a solid product, and if you like a game in which you can actually relax, listen to some music and have fun without shooting people. A very interesting title for any player who owns a steering wheel.",

For a game that may not look as polished as AAA titles it does look pretty in its own little way, from the detailed trucks to the landscape that, in some cases, look as close to their real life counterparts as you will get in a computer game. Sure there are things that could be improved but what I will say is whilst others will moan that they are taking too long in releasing things like their next map DLC all I will say is just be glad it isn't the pre-ETS2 days where you would be lucky to get even one patch!

Cities do get abit overcrowded but they are no collision zones so it doesn't really damage your truck, you can still carry on as normal, with your buisness and deliverys, and even create a virtual trucking company, where you can upload logbooks of your trailers, and upload reports on fines and crashes, really is a fun and intresting game, never thought i would sit behind a computer so long playing this game.

But i am sure that these details are crucial for truck driving. This is a realy nice openworld simultions game for even rookie truck drivers.  Here are the cons that i can see: Tha games graphics card req is high but the environment is not that good looking. Even with my R9 380 i can see occasional fps drops on ultra settings @1080. This is not a downside but when radio is playing in the truck, there should have been some echo or accustics or something like that. If you have played farcry 3, there are veichles and you hear radio is playing while driving. In this game, it is like an excluded music player. There is traffic in this openworld game and the ai is not that smart. Sometimes they can smash into your truck while you are coming out of a full repair :) AI should be avoding crashes. Cuz sometimes they are just blind. This is not a con but if it is an openworld game and there is traffic, there has to be an option for traffic density. It would be realy nice to see lots of cars on the roads or no cars at all. When the game gets an update, it termintates your ongoing saved mission and pays you for it. I don't want the money, i want to complete my mission. The game is getting frequent updates and this is sometimes annoying. The map can be a little bit less repetitive with some additions. I think it is a little bit hard to make money. I mean if you want a fully upgraded scania truck, you have to play for like a 100 hours. This is my subjective opinion, some people may think that it should be hard to get a truck like that. Your choice. There are lots of dlc for this game. 2 of them are expansions to the map and others are paint jobs and interior decorations. I think 1 is for heavy cargo. Some of these dlc should not be dlc. They should be standart issue.  And i do not see any other downsides. Here are the pros: Map is big enough so you can spend hours in the game. If you do not mind repeating environments, you will have lots of quality time :) There are lots of control and driving options. This is an important requirement for a simulations game. There are options for seat position, mirrors and light adjustments, break intensity, rain probability, trailer stability ... etc. There is a cruise control. There is an in-game radio, so you are not stuck with your truck roaring all the time. You can also create your playlist with your own music. There is a company management system. Which means you are not alone in the game and this is cool. It is also a faster way to make money. There are occasional pedestrians. It feels like a live action game. There should be more of them here and there. Which reminds me, it would be nice to see some crashes on the road. Maybe a truck turned upside down and some people are helping the driver. Or a car going off the road while driving. So i can say, holly ****, that dude was too fast and he deserved it :) Truck sounds are realistic. They are actually recorded live. You can play with keyboard, gamepad or a wheel and they all have their specific options. There are camera controls to help you check the corners. You do not have to use mouse to look around. There are different camera angles, you can drive from outside if you want. There are traffic tickets for speeding or passing through red light. There is a penalty for avoding sleep :) You start dozing if you do not sleep for too long. There are a variety of trucks with their own characteristics.  So this is all i can say objectively about this game. If you don't mind repeating environment and long play times, this is an addictive simulation game.",

With map expansion DLCs such as 'Going East' and 'Scandinavia', there is so much more to explore and with the upcoming 'Vive La France' there will be even more to explore. With the additional DLC, you're sure to find a place of your liking to have as your truck HQ  There is a good variety of trucks, the 7 makes in the game are: Scania, Volvo, Iveco, MAN, DAF, Mercedes-Benz and Renault. Some of these trucks have a couple of different models but there is sure to be something you'll like. A range of different cabin sizes so if you prefer a small sleeper truck you can have that, or the much larger sleeper cabins. If you want to take things a step further, you can modify the exterior of your truck with accessories and of course even pick some paintjobs. There is additonal DLC which you can buy which will allow you to modify the interior of your truck, let you pick from a wider range of paintjobs and more.  This game has a lot to offer, if you like driving (trucks especially) then this is sure to be a game for you.  ",

Almost at destination and a npc driver slams his brakes on a 80mph highway infront of me for no reason.(no one infront of him.)  doges the ♥♥♥♥ tard by a needle and almost flips the trailer over.  then i get to fight the parking lot of the delivery destination for 25-30 min. Had to deliver a digger 500 for som ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason to a food store. like 7-11 or a simlar store.   and the loading bay was extremly tight. (yes a loading bay. the type whitch has a retractable door and are raised 1,5 meters up)  It tock me 10 min just to back the ♥♥♥♥ing truck in to a possition of where i could reverse in to the drop of point. but then the dam fence of that loading bay became a ♥♥♥♥in issiue instead.  now the truck is in a possistion where i can reverse it but not turn in any direction.  after 20 min of ... less than kind usage of words in a mildly loud fassion i finaly got the truck and its cargo in to the drop of square. and can complete the delivery.  had to pay 30k for damages. but thats ok. i just wan't to kill the architect of that specifick delivery point!  IF i ever see THAT ♥♥♥♥ing place agen so am i going to do stuff no one are going to be hapy about!  i have had 2 other bad experiences but they are i no way comparable whit this one. once got stuck in a traffick jam at a T junction for 10 min cuse bad AI. and once i got stuck in a quarry whit a heavy delivery and the truck i where given was to weak to pull the load up the hill out from the quarry! i could and did cansel that one.

Since then, I've spent countless hours with a controller in my hand, driving down motorways, mountain passes and all over Scandinavia. I can honestly say that this game is hands down my favourite hobby (besides climbing IRL, but who needs that when you can drive all day?).  If you're thinking about buying this game, stop. Stop thinking. Just do it. So scroll on back up and press that 'Add to Cart' button.

I bought it during the recent Summer Sale and took a chance on it. Going in I knew from experience that I loved sim games, but I was just expecting this one to be silly.   I couldn't have been farther from the truth. There are some limits to the sim sure, but this looks and feels like you actually are trying to build a trucking empire across Europe. This is now my go-to game when I want something a bit slower paced and relaxing. I highly recommend for anyone that plays to download a bunch of podcasts or audiobooks that you have been wanting to catch up on or maybe you haven't listened to before. (Check out NPR's Serial podcast series)   This function in the game really sells it for me, I can catch up on all my latest football (soccer) podcasts and also listen to great stories all while working towards having a massive trucking empire across Europe. I suggest playing with a Steam controller or another controller if you don't have one to make the steering a bit easier, or you could go whole hog and buy a steering wheel. Just remember to customize and tweak until you find all of the buttons and steering to your liking.  I plan on buying American Truck Simulator once I've had my fill of ETS2 and I couldn't be more thankful that I took a chance and added a great sim series to my library.",

You can build your own company, and imagine yourself as multimillionaire manager who lives in tuned truck. Doesn;t matter how many hours you spend playing this game. With new DLC and hardware like steering wheel, or TrackIR gaming experience growns into new level. One thing I would add to this game is visible damage to truck. Everything else is fine.

You start by doing jobs for other truck companies before you have enough money to buy your own truck and work for your own company, you're your own boss before you have enough money to hire other people that will drive trucks for your company bringing in more money. There is a level and progression system to unlock upgrades for your truck and be able to do longer journeys with different cargo like fuel or explosives, but something that Euro Truck lacks is a meaning to all these different trailers besides the looks of it, why should I drive carefully with explosives on the back of my truck when I know it can't explode? why should I have care for my cargo? could I damage it and lose whats inside? there is a damage system where when you crash into something, either your truck or your trailer gets damage, the higher the damage on your cargo, the less pay, the more damage on your truck the more it stalls and beeps at you telling you that you are a horrible driver and that you need to spend money on getting it fixed. Euro Truck also has a fuel system to fuel up your HUGE tank, this never really occurs tho as it takes less than 2 minutes to full up and its always less than 1,000 euro to fuel up and you get way more than that every time you do a trailer job.  In short, Euro Truck Simulator 2 is only fun if you like trucks and driving (This game has AMAZING FFB support for wheels) there is no real consequence for bad driving other than fines and damage, creating lack for care of your truck and cargo.",

Even if you tried the demo soon after it was released and didn't like it because of the amount of bugs or lack of content, give it another try. Free developer patches provide continual new content (since release - all brands are licensed except Mercedes, with 3 new trucks added to the game and another coming soon) on top of paid DLCs and free fan-made addons, some of which are truly remarkable. Definitely buy the game. And don't even think about piracy, as the trailers will disappear and your truck will turn PINK.",

Euro Truck 2 also looks really impressive, the trucks are modeled superbly and the European scenery is always pleasant. But the most impressive feature is the ability to stream actual radio stations in-game. Nothing creates more immersion than listening to Liverpool's Rock Radio (Which doesn't really play much rock music) while running a shipment of Yogurt between Sheffield and Swansea.

Concept goes: buy a truck, pick a job, pick up the load, drive to the destination, empty the load, repair/upgrade/fuel your truck and learn new skills. After awhile you can afford a second truck and can hire one extra driver. A lot of attention has been put to details. There's dynamic weather system, day/night cycle, traffic violations, AI traffic, etc.  There are many new cities to discover and you can use ferries and train tunnel to reach UK from mainland Europe. I recommend Going East and High Power Cargo pack DLCs as they're quite cheap and extend the map and available delivery missions. Scandiavian DLC is also on it's way.  There's a lively modding community around ETS2, good player made maps, multiplayer and expansions. A steering wheel is recommended, but I found mouse &amp; keyboard fine aswell. This game supports Naturalpoint TrackIR and Oculus DK1/2 for those who have them.   In my opinion the learning curve of this game is low, though some basic knowledge about trucks can be useful. To me, it's not a hardcore simulator.",

AI cars (specifically large trucks) sometimes stop completely if you bump into them slightly in a narrow street. The DLC packs come with a couple of bad paint jobs but some great ones.

It's very good, I don't know how you would improve honestly other than a graphical update.  A suprisingly fun game that is challenging in the driving mechanics, offers light RPG elements via leveling up your driver to take on better jobs, economic game elements by building up your corporation with more garages and drivers doing things in strategic places, integration into an streaming service so you can stream a lot of different music while you play, most importantly a hypnotic experience that truely warms your cockles having fun in the simulation, and gives you that rush when completing and starting missions to keep on truckin'. Wow, that pun was unintended but apt. Very deftly done, Nooch.  There is a demo, which hooked me, so if you haven't tried out this game for 10 minutes you're simply robbing yourself of a rich experience.   Pros: - Fun challenge in simulation - RPG elements - economic game elements - good streaming music integration (or your own MP3s) - relaxing! And I'm not easily relaxed - one-more-mission addictive element  Cons: - graphics are contemporary, and it's a few years old - Interface can be awkward, but it's not a traditional genre so standards are not well-defined.",

Otherwise this game is fun looks great, my only complain is the punishment system, if your driving and someone crashes into you you get punished, and i wish there were police cars as well as the cameras for traffic violations. to add a bit more realism. Otherwise its fun to drive and build a trucking empire. Hope to see more and more expansions to maps from this group as right now only way to get most of france, italy and into russia is with mods that are flakey at best except pro mods. Some truck mods work some dont. But over all if you enjoy Truck driving simulation this is top notch a must have.",

However Euro Truck Simulator 2 is pretty much in its own league of simulators. The game is nothing short of beautiful, the gameplay is smooth and doesn't require an amazing pc to run it, the playability is off the charts, the detail of the environment and trucks is a work of art and most of all, the experience of driving through this amazing world is extremely enjoyable and something you will find yourself going back to, time and time again.  If you had to nitpick the bad parts of this game you could say that the AI isn't very good, or that their isn't a FOV slider. However, these are problems that are also present in many of today's blockbuster games, and what Euro Truck Simulator 2 does have in it's favour is a dedicated team that are constantly updating and improving the game.",

            "review_text": "Euro Truck Simulator 2.  What can be said about this game that hasn't been said already. It is quite fun to play. I have approximately 20 hours in the game, and that's about where I'd say most users that would be interested in this, would get to. For someone more casual, and not into the 'sim' genre (think... the person that plays flight simulator, and the first thing they do is nose it over into the ground because they wanted to see what the crash looked like)... you're probably looking at about 5 hours.  Pros: The game is good, it's well oiled, and a complete package. You'll have no problem picking it up, driving for miles, and running an RPG style trucking company if you'd like, or you could simply roam about in the countryside racking up speeding fines.  Cons: They types of loads get a bit repetitive, and I think the developers are missing a HUGE opportunity for a CHALLENGING trucking sim. Spin Tires goes further than it needs to (though still a FANTASTIC game), but where Spin Tires is all mud, and challenge... ETS2 is all highway, and cruise control. Adding a variety of loads to carry, and the challenge of mountain trucking, or big city fuel tanker deliveries, etc... would make this game much more interesting.  Still, the mod community is strong. I prefer not to mod, since they're largely just skins, which I find provide nothing more than (no pun) a skin deep experience.  Buy it if: You're fascinated by running a freight business as an owner/operator, and enjoy the long haul aspects of FSX.  Skip it if: You're looking for something that requires you to think your way through something, or do more than remember to indicate properly, and back a big rig into a loading dock. True story, I've fallen asleep while driving on the virtual highway on a longhaul... which is probably realistic... but not the kind of realism I want in a game.  I'm giving it a 7/10 if you don't mod. I wish there was more variety in the challenge of loads (long loads, doubles, triples, oversized, etc.), and the traffic AI seems to leave something to be desired.",

However, if you are looking for something unique that isn't dealing death to millions of identikit villains or being a one-person saviour of the universe, why not give Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) a try?  I recently moved from Xbox 360 back to the PC scene. In the years that I had an Xbox, I found that I really missed the kind of games that only PC has. Games where essentially nothing happens. The world won't end if you don't achieve your objective.  This is why I like ETS2.  This is an extremely well-supported game. The publishers regularly issue free updates (not just bug fixes, but additional cities, road networks, trucks, etc).   I have sunk hours into this game just driving a truck from one city to another, and then another city, etc. It is a great way to while away time with no stress. Although the roads and cities are very loosely based on the real-life versions, I don't think that you could ever hope to compare game vs. real-world with any degree of accuracy. Having said that, there are certain roads that I have travelled in-game and in real-life and found myself thinking 'wow, they got that right!', so must be an element of consideration of the real-world road network.  Controls were initially an issue, but a recent update fixed that with proper Xbox controller support. Performance-wise, the game has never crashed or had any technical problems at all. It runs at max settings on my PC (which is fairly high-spec, so I would expect that!)  My main criticisms are minor; the graphics can seem a little bleached out / over-saturated (in HDR mode especially), sometimes the AI drivers create a bottleneck where they all block a junction waiting for a vehicle to turn - this causes the lane that the vehicle needs to cross to become blocked (I had to barge my way through the roadside to get past!). Another minor complaint is that the roads seem very under-populated. If possible, there needs to be an option to increase AI traffic.  All in all, I love ETS2 and would recommend it to anyone looking for a game to pass time in.",

I bought this game to laugh at it, I've bought many simluators in the past 'for a laugh', I thought this was going to be no different.   Making the profile was comical. I even found a picture of Ellen DeGeneres which I ended up choosing for my trucker. I called my company something 'funny' like 'Les-Be-Friends'. Just the usual for me when starting a new simulator game...  But then the game started and I was awestruck.   The graphics are beautiful. Very detailed and well designed.   The game physics aren't a piece of ♥♥♥♥ like they are on usual simulators.  The sound effects are brilliant. No complaint from me.  Now... the gameplay.  When I did my first job/mission, I didn't take it seriously; I caused as much damage as possible. I maybe lasted about 30 minutes before I closed the game and went to bed. The next morning I had an urge to finish it and so I did. That was the moment I got hooked onto this.   I've now started taking it seriously, abiding by the laws of the road, stopping at traffic lights... I've even bought myself a wheel controller just so I can feel even more immersed in the game.   This game is what simulators should be. Euro Truck Simulator 2 and OMSI are the REAL simulators not Farm Simulator 2012, Woodcutter 2013 etc.  I was never interested in trucks or driving but now I love it. If anybody has actually gotten this far in my review, then please try this game because I was just as uninterested as you are and now look at me!   10/10 - I reccomend this game A LOT.  PS: There is currently a brilliant Mod out for this game that enables multiplayer. It takes no time to get it working, you only have to install it... nothing else.   The mod allows you and your friends to truck as one. You will come across a lot of other people too. I just went on multiplayer and there was over 2,000 people playing. It isn't littered with trolls either as they are quickly banned for blocking roads, purposely banging into other players etc etc.   This adds to the game even more. So please, try this game out or forever be known as an idiot!",

            "review_text": "Generally I consider the game to be poor and weak. It is not for people who like realism. If there was a better game I would not recommend this one. I guess it's like the saying 'One-eyed is the king among the blind.'  When I was buying the game it was very cheap... like 5 Euros... I would never want to pay 20 for it. It's not worth it.  positives: + It's the only truck simulator game I know about + It's in Europe and has Slovakia included + It has a simplistic transport company management incorporated + Most of the time it is fun + Many truck types and the possibility to adjust and tweak your trucks + Semi-realistic handling - if you go too fast into a sharp curve, the trucks steering might lock due to the tilt, what I kinda like. I still miss a further realism, though  negatives - the game is absurdly static. After a while I got bored by the sceneries always being the same, roadworks being at the same place all the time, the only dynamics being provided by the traffic - there are no objectives in the game. If there were other companies you would be trying to beat, I believe that would be great - there is no way to see your whole truck fleet or to meet other of your trucks on the road - the traffic accidents - a car bumps into you, you get a fine despite the fact you haven't caused the accident, and if you don't get a fine, you're left with a damaged truck/load and no financial compensation, hitting the mileposts even in slow speed (which in reality are from plastic) causes heavy damage, I managed to hit a barrier at the side of the road with the side of a truck and had heavier damage than after a rollover - the truck models damage is another thing - the models are compact with no deformation damage showing, so you can have 30% damage and the truck looks ok. Once your engine is damaged, it might die during running without immediatelly stopping the truck, what I really don't consider very realistic  - static radars - once you know where they are, you can keep speeding on any other roads - the scenery is many times unrealistic, placing forests and hills, where there are none, etc. - absurd traffic rules - like crossings without traffic lights of a standard rod with a highway, automatic fine for your wheel crossing the line on traffic lights controlled crossroads, etc. - my truck once suddenly started to bounce and then exploded - no slippery roads - there is no winter in the game (or perhaps I still need to find out ) and even during the rain the truck handling isn't changing. I have never experienced with strong breaking, that the trailer would slip sideways - no older european trucks are available - helloween trucks in the DLC can't have the base color changed",

After a few jobs you have the option to get a loan from the bank to buy your very own truck. This is where the game truly opens. With your own truck you can drive around anywhere in the map and explore it as you please. Jobs give a higher pay so you can profit something while also paying off your debt.

First I want to address the long voyage from the early games from the early 2000's followed by a decade later of outstanding shame and realistically gameplay that was introduced by these the rock players that brought this game to the community of hard-core truck drivers as well as fans to sit behind the stand will and achieve greatness of world exploring customization in a flat nose truck in the continent of Europe. The cities are tacitly made to showcase the location herein to bring the warm atmosphere by the landscapes and views of bus couple traffic lights to interrupt scenery in order not to get a ticket in the game which is the coolest thing in my mall textbook of games need to have this period. The weather elements in the gameplay presents a 24 hour clock zone as well as the fact of raining which you can adjust the settings of coming up once in a month or having a rainy session go on every couple hours in the game before… Of individual lets a sense of the raining effect as well as activating you windshield wipers in order to see the road ahead without colliding and damaging a cargo. One feature I like to see the gameplay introduced to the next update also is a small fact that some research came upon a mod worry you can add the effect of snow but my type of individual lets about this building in the game without having to do actual work to achieve something like this. The gameplay details are fantastic for me trendsetting alliance hazard lights, fogs, as well as your high beams to flash your local drivers or on the multiplayer kind gives a respectable road followed by choosing from several and horns to attach to truck. The games customization for your tribes is outstandingly one-of-a-kind anonymous see another community driver with the same scheme of accessories on the truck but you will run into the same manufacturer brand But exploring the so-called brands there are build in the game following by sequels of schemes of trucks within each brand to choose from one leveling up and gaining income in the gameplay. You get to build a Empire of headquarters followed by five transfer each company as well as hiring drivers in game to bring you income. You can find more information about this on Steve's immunity explaining building an empire of trucks this is just a review think I give a sense in a glance of the game to build interests to get it in-depth reading that is honest. Click the gameplay button purchase a semi truck then explore the world buy garage higher couple crew members and sit back explore the cities and landscapes while collecting income in the game as truly yours have fun explore three thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "The haters are gonna hate, but the simulators are gonna simulate, and the haters are going to miss out on the best PC driving game since Stunts came out over 22 years ago.  Simulation games are all about trying something that you would otherwise not be able to do in real life; its not like most people have ever even met a truck driver before, let alone had the chance to become one, its kinda like being an astronaut: only the best of the best ever have a hope of getting behind that wheel. So if you didn't have perfect grades in highschool, and don't have PHD level degree in engineering, finally here is your chance to haul apples from Munich to Frankfurt in a 40 ft trailer!  But seriously, Euro Truck Sim 2 is a perfect example of a game that really shouldn't work, but does. Lets face it the subject matter is horrible, it simulates a job that I can tell you from experience most people would gladly walk away from and never return if they didn't have a mortgage and 2 kids at home. But somehow the beautifully rendered European scenery, the generally really good physics, the open world gameplay, and the lite buisness sim gameplay provide just enough to make this a really good game. I find that rather than feeling like I am at work when I play it, its always `just one more haul`, so I can do X, and it becomes really addictive.  Players that have played `cargo trading` games before such as Wing Commander privateer or Freelancer will feel right at home here, although instead of getting shot at, its all about safe driving and good route choices. Strongly recommend it to anyone who wants a good casual driving game with a fun economic rpg built in. If you hate driving games in general, or are generally more action oriented in your game choices maybe take a pass on this one.",

My only wish is that they would make more routes to the same place, maybe some side roads, or a sandbox mode. Maybe a random blocked road with road detours. Oh, and don't use the self parking.

Probably the biggest waste of time since minecraft, but since minecraft it has also occupied so many of my hours Its astounding, Great if you feel like you need somthing to do or if you wanna learn the the shift pattern of a truck, with some editing(or fourm browsing) you can get yourself a 18 speed truck and then learn that 9 speed layout.   My only real gripes with this game are the citys are extremely small, you have to use a clutch, (you cannot rev match to shift) and the gearshift doesnt track itself, you can shift into gear then let the clutch out and drag the stick into the next and nothing will change untill you push the clutch. Shifting could use some work.  And for the love of (insert your deity here) Optomize this GAME!!! 15 FPS in citys with 2 R9 280x's is unacceptable guys!  Bottomline, I would reccomend this game. If you run in eyefinity the games not quite fast enough, but at 1080p there should be no problems for any decent dual core (no Quad support, it runs but better if you limit it to two) with a throw in dedicated graphics at High, my laptops integrated intel can run at about medium.  So give it a try especially if its on sale, If you get away and have better than 30 FPS you will love it, Under 30, you will get frustrated at times but at the same time you will still have that urge to play it.",

While your drivers will find jobs by themselves, and do not really need your input, you can either do jobs for other companies, or do the jobs with your own truck. Or simply go freeroaming if you're in the mood for that.  The driving itself works great. Easy controls and fairly realistic physics. I have no complaints here.  Graphics are good. Not great, but decent enough for me. Music and sound effect are also good, but there's no music while you drive. However, you can either add mp3s to a playlist, or tune in on internet radio channels, if you want to.  I only have two issues with this game, none are gamebreaking:  1. Traffic AI is sometimes kinda silly, but they are constantly working on improving it. 2. No cloud save. This means that if I want to play in my house, then continue in my apartment, I have to copy save files and bring them with me. Very annoying for those of us who lives two places with a stationary PC both places.  If you'd like a casual driving sim, without the big challenges, this is the game for you. I recommend you get the Going East DLC too, as it adds more countries, and remember to check out the Scandinavia DLC when it gets released. The rest of the DLCs are just paintjobs for your trucks, I don't recommend spending a lot of money here, get them while on sale, which they often are.",

[Realism] The Creators of Euro Truck Simulator 2 (SCS Software) did their research on this style, it not only captures the raw nature of truck driving, but also the feeling of coming out into the world of truck driving. I talk not from personal expierence but one of second hand as family does drive trucks for a living, but in the United States.  [Fun Factor] I may not be overly interested in driving a truck throughout Europe, but this game makes that so entertaining and fun. After several hours I already am transfixed and addicted to driving, it's almost meditative to me. But also, after a long day of people ticking me off, it is also lovely to make a save and simply demolish every person on the road.  [Polish] Graphics high or low this game has an extraodinary amount of detail, when driving down a road it doesn't feel like the road is repeated over and over at all, it feels like I'm GOING somewhere, not many simulators capture that these days. If you look closely you can also see so much detail in the skys, from clouds brewing before it rains to airplanes passing by every now and again.  [My Recommendation] Buy this game, but I would highly recommend using either a gamepad/Xbox controller or an actual steering wheel but keyboard works just fine.  [Cons] Once you get into the meat of the game and buying garages it can sometimes feel unrealistic with your drivers just bustling around on their own free will and you can't actual request they take a certain job. But that is my only complaint.",

After that I missed several turnoff points to get to my destination, blew a few red lights which cost euros, and hit a few cars, costing more euros. I finally arrived about an hour past the delivery time. At the end of that, not only did I not get paid, I owed the bank about 3,000 Euros. I learned.

The fact that you can create your own lifestyle as a trucker and have your own company grows on you quite quickly.

There are so many great features to this game and awesome upgrades from the original Euro Truck Simulator that it is awe inspiring. There are a couple cons, yes, but they are FAR outshadowed by the pros.   PROS:  GREAT truck selection. From Volvo to DAF, from MAN to Iveco, from Renault to SCANIA, you are completely covered.  All trucks are able to be customized in a plethora of ways Driving is fun with your trucks performance affected by the weight of the load in realistic fashion i.e Engine working harder while going uphill, takes longer to gain momentum with a full load from dead stop etc Graphics are nice and clean for trucks themselves as well as the loads you haul Expansive map Many many more  CONS: Steering can get a bit clunky without a steering wheel. (I use keyboard and controller in varying degrees as I can't justify laying down close to $100 for a steering wheel to play a single game) Game time can become a pain in the ♥♥♥ when you try and figure out how far you can drive and how much you have to do before the day ends and your loan installment is taken from you NPC driver AI can be a bit stupid at times Towns are not very well fleshed out in places and highway driveby areas are rather plain and dull  All in all though, I highly recommend the game as it is a great way to unwind from your day while you wind up gears and truck on down the highway leaving all your problems behind like a lot lizard at the truck stop.  9.5/10",

And then after an hour I have to peel them off of the wheel because they don't want to stop.  Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a leisurely driving game. You find jobs, pick up loads, haul them, and park the trailer on the other end. Along the way you'll follow your GPS, watch some beautiful sunrises, and watch the scenery pass by. Eventually you'll amass enough wealth to buy your own truck (and keep more profits), expand your garage, and then your fleet, and hire other drivers. But the real fun is listening to the wealth of internet radio stations the game has pre-programmed. When you're cruising over the mountains of Bavaria with Johnny Cash piping through the speakers (and a beverage of choice in your hand), you'll get why this game is fun. ",

A bit of configuration is needed to get comfortable, but it's quite easy straight off the bat.  -The AI is quite decent...they drive better than many real people do. They're poor brakers though, so don't drive out in font of them! -AI do make poor decisions though, just like real drivers.

When I just want to relax while gaming, I play this. Put the radio on, pick up your cargo, sit back and go for a nice drive across Europe.  The game's only downside is that the AI of other vehicles on the road is sometimes iffy, for example I was caught in a traffic jam once, I'd sat there for about 5 mins waiting for it to move until I decided to drive around the cars in front to find the car at the front of the jam was just sitting there with nothing in front of it.

Steering with a keyboard is probably the biggest hiccup. What I dislike the fact the game is that it's very generic. Once you seen once town you seen them all. It's a fun game if you're looking to kill time, this will kill a lot of it. For me, a 'retired' RL trucker, it started to feel like a job. The pressure to get there early and be on time and the fact that if you take a wrong exist, you're fracked.  On a professional level, a lot of this game is missing that can't really make it a real simulator.  -No circle checks (CC) for trucks (should be at least twice daily pre and post trip) -Most railings way too close to white line -If someone t-bones my trailer, I should be able to fight my ticket -Never have to go to the bathroom, this is a huge factor... soiling yourself could cost you more than a pair of pants -Coffee is missing when in fact, it's the fuel of truckers -Auto Parking should deduct experience - Truckers are experts at backing up and SHOULD be - I used to charge for backing up other's truck -The flashers and marker lights should be a bit more bright -Speed limiter's speeds are set by the company (I drove 55MPH &amp; 62MPH trucks of the same company) -Driver manager distributes the loads accordingly - even Owner Operators often join trucking companies who take O/O's because it's a steady flow of income, instead of waiting in random truck stops to get a load back home but are free to take or refuse any work load they want. -Shunter Drivers - Be one or hire one. Those work either around specific company yards or just do the shunting around town... two different trucks too. Shunters don't leave a trifecta of cities within the same larger megalopolis. -Fueling - Drivers have to get out and fuel -Log Book - We still use paper logs for most part but some companies do have e-logs, also part of CC. -Windows &amp; Washer - Never used them here... it's a very integral part of trucking and is part of CC. -You can never go bankrupt... I tried... ask the millions of O/O's who did though, see what they'll tell ya.  Simulator-wise it's passable, as a realistic trucking game it's a pretty dang good time killer but don't play it if you're mad, play it when you're in the zone.",

Instantaneous engine change, or repairs? I don't think so. Maybe a hire mechanics thing for the garages as well--a few extra staff to pay, but who's skill and number can decrease the amount of time maintenance takes when repairing/maintaining a truck that returns to the garage (not just your personal vehicle, but those of your company drivers as well). 3) Your own trailer--and the need to back up to a loading bay and wait for the cargo to unload. 4) Team drivers: two to a truck.

It was insanely cool. But be sure it's the official website if you're planning on downloading and installing ETS2:MP. I remember the first time I played this game, man it was fun. And the thing is, I STILL PLAY! Most of the games I happen to play, I can't get an interest grip on, But THIS game? Heck Yeah. Thanks for taking your time in reading this~ I appreciate it!  PROS:  + Graphics Are Great! + Physics Are Realistic! + MODS! + Controls Are Good! + BECOME A COMPANY OWNER! + HIRE WORKERS &amp; BUY/CUSTOMISE TRUCKS! + Can be a time-consumer and/or a boredum-killer + Back-In Your Trailer For Extra EXP! + Import Your Own Music (So you can jam on the roads WHILE being a badass)! + Variety of Different Trucks To Drive! + Not all Trucks Drive The Same! + Can Be Played Online Through A Mod (ETS2:MP)!  CONS:  - Can be laggy because of other cars/truckers/cities - Tunnels are laggy as ♥♥♥♥ (For me, anyways) - Cars can be total idiots and jerks (so can other AI Truckers)... - It can take to 2 to 3 loads to level up one. - Collisions Can Tip You Over. - TRAFFIC AND LAG. - Only Can Be Played Singleplayer UNLESS You Install/Download ETS2:MP. - NOT intended for Computers that can't run extreme (Graphic-wise, though you can lower them) games...  10 Out Of 10, I Will Drive That Truck Again!",

To summarize : hell yeah ! ^^ Driving these trucks around is a relaxing experience, just the kind of game one would need at the end of a full day at work. The graphics are nice, though I would've liked SCS to improve them a bit more (hint : take a look at 'The Crew'). I'd also loved it if the map scale would be a tad smaller (currently around 1:19, maybe 1:15 or even towards 1:10 would've been nice IMO). The AI still does stupid stuff (e.g. jamming you after you pass toll stations or when desperately wanting to enter a pertol station). Nevertheless, SCS continues to patch the game and improve the AI, which is great (version 1.22 at the time of writing this review). Got the 'Going East' DLC and planning to buy the 'Scandinavia' one at the next Steam Sale. The 'High Power Cargo Pack' is a bit light on content though (7 or 8 new cargo types), but I bought it for the added difficulty. Would love to see some additional cargo types added to this DLC in the future, maybe to round it up to 10 or so ... Overall, a 7/10. It's not my kind of game, but I enjoyed playing it more than I'd ever thought I would.",

You can access different European radio stations in different languages while driving which adds a feeling of authenticity. The scenery is pretty and being able to customize your truck (especially if you have the truck accessory pack DLC or whatever it is called) is really fun. You can expand your company and hire new truckers and buy new trucks to expand your money-making ability, and there is a plethora of mods you can download to expand the map, enhance the scenery and weather effects, and add different trucks and whatever.

I tend to find them lacking in purpose and direction, and can't bring myself to play them more than the opening experience. That being said, it's almost impossible to describe why ETS2 is so enjoyable.  The premise is simple. You pick a job, pick up the trailer, drop off the trailer and collect money and XP. Money goes towards new trucks, equipment, garages and hiring drivers, and XP goes towards unlocking new jobs or increasing rewards (or lowering fuel usage). There's really not much more to it than that, and yet, ETS2 is strangely engaging.  You can approach ETS2 like a genuine simulator, where you obey traffic rules, take a nice, slow pace for jobs, listen to the soothing 'taps' of your indicator and relax along to the gentle hum of your engine. It sounds simple, but it's oddly cathartic. Alternatively, you can haul ♥♥♥, roaring down the highway at breakneck speeds, praying your trailer doesn't tip around the corner as you cut off AI and weave through traffic, racing against fatigue as you listen to jams like 'Convoy' and 'East Bound and Down' (more on this later).  If you're like me, like I know I am, the most you know about trucks is that they're big. And slow. ETS2 lets you jump straight in and drive from A to B simply with WASD, and you can even skip parking the trailer in exchange for an XP loss. Alternatively, for the full truck simulation experience, you can opt to manually control everything from your gear selection to your retarder to your axle height, use of your exhaust brake, and even manually using your mirrors and on-board GPS system instead of the user-friendly HUD elements (you can even adjust your mirrors to suit your needs).  That being said, there are some limitations to the simulator. From what I understand, the physics aren't fully 100% accurate, for things such as being able to use any chassis size for any job and not seeing much of a difference in physics (there may be some) during storms. Speed limits change without warning in some sections (usually just before a speed camera), but these are relatively predictable once you're familiar with an area. AI behaves in strange ways, particularly around roundabouts, so you'll probably end up with a fine for causing a crash because some driver tried to overtake you on the outside. That being said, the AI is often predictable and you can avoid these incidents with a bit of practise.  There is no in-game music (outside of menus) and the radio station requires an internet connection, so you'll have to bring along your own jams for the offline experience. The graphics are starting to show their age, but the sounds are quite authentic. And of course, there is mod support and .ini tweaking to create the experience you desire.  Overall, this is definitely my favourite simulator, and I now look at trucks and truck drivers from a whole new perspective.",

You're doing 80 and then theres that red light. If anyone was in the car with you, they would be bugs on the window. In all seriousness, this game is for relaxation and is still lots of fun.

Now, story time over. LETS DO THIS REVIEW!  So it was October 2012, Euro truck simulator 2 just came in the post. All of the non-licenced brands were licenced (Except Volvo) I played the non-steam version for about 200 hours (probably more)alone. I had about a million save games. I played it. Then in December 2013 I took a break from PC games and went to PS3 and XBOX360. But the tie of euro truck simulator couldn't be broken! So in late 2014 I went back to it! Well not really... In February I moved house and I could not find the disc for ETS 2 anywhere! So I went to the steam store in July 2015 and found it on sale! That meant I saw loads of DLCs I've never seen before! I got used to it and downloaded A HEAP of mods! I loved it! So with over 100 hours on steam and over 200 hours on the non-steam version I would definately buy!

So here is my review:   When I first bought Euro Truck Simulator 2 I thought it was great. Driving my truck, Making money, Driving around freely. It was perfect. (I didn't know there was a multiplayer at this time.) Then when I closed Euro Truck Simulator 2 I saw that it said there was a multiplayer. So I downloaded it. (My friend also had multiplayer just didn't tell me.) Once I got it I played Euro Truck Simulator 2 multiplayer and I loved it. But then I played with my friend. Trust me if you play Euro Truck Simulator 2 and you have a friend who has it play Multiplayer. In multiplayer you can join VTC'S (Virtual Trucking Companies) Which is where you can Join companies and work for them. You can join there Teamspeak, Join special events which is good and it's just amazing.   Overall I rate this game 10/10, This game is for the people who like A Money Making, Real life game. If you do then this is definetly the game for you. If you next buy a game on steam I recommend for you to buy this game.   ",

I actually use the picture mode in the game for taking pictures as if I am sightseeing and there are times when I have to Wiki an area that isn't a playable town because it looks so cool (like Bregenz).

Det som kan kännas tråkigt är att det inte är alla europeiska länder i Euro Truck Simulator 2. Men jag tror att det kommer i framtida versioner av lastbilssimulatorn, om det kommer fler. Spela Euro Truck Simulator 2 och se om du tycker om simulatorn eller inte. Om du tycker om det visa det och hoppas att det kommer fler i framtiden. Men om du inte tycker om det tala om så att de kanske kan koregera simulatorn så att det blir bättre.  Men från mig: Stort tack för denna simulator ",

Where other vehicle-obsessed devs seem to take player motivation for granted, Czech studio SCS understand that a pleasingly modelled steed needs a pleasingly modelled environment to shine.  On this occasion that environment is a swathe of Europe stretching from Plymouth in the west to Wroclaw in the east, from Aberdeen in the north to Milan in the South. The tangle of motorways and major roads is stylised and condensed, but feels massive. After a splendid week of non-stop trucking the stats screen tells me I've still only seen 50% of it.  There's satisfaction in exploring new routes, seeing new golden been-there-done-that squiggles appearing on the in-game map, but it tends to be the promise of cold, hard cash that gets you out of bed in the morning. Like Farming Simulator, ETS2 has a simple yet resonant economic sandbox at its centre.  You start as a low-skilled, truckless lorry jockey, forced to take work from established haulage companies. Slowly (or rapidly if you go to a bank) you amass the funds to buy your first rig and rent your first yard. Then the fun really begins. Contract perusing, truck pimping, skill upgrading, driver hiring... this is Eddie Stobart: The Game in all but name.  Spending 90 minutes ferrying a tank of propane from Sheffield to Prague could (should?) be tedious. The fact that it isn't is largely down to good-if-not-quite-OMSI-standard physics, and varied road layouts and scenery. Periods of smooth, almost soporific motorway motoring nestle between passages of edgier wheelwork. One minute you're cruising along contemplating the sunset over the central reservation, the next you're on a rain-lashed country road at night, waiting for the right moment to pass a painfully slow pantechnicon. Tiredness can't kill in ETS2, but it can leave you jack-knifed in a ditch, feeling awful with a substantial repair bill to pay.",

Would have been nice to also have a tractor - trailer config, but the 'Sattel Aufleger' will do too. I guess this is the trend with modern 'Fracht Transport Firmen' anyway. Has it's advantages, I have to admit. Also, I recommend a Logitech Steering Wheel, unfortunately at a cost. I had an older one sitting in the closet for years, so I didn't have to spent on that. With the Steering wheel, shifter and pedals, it is much smoother to control and in my opinion adding to the all over experience. There is a position sensing device, that tracks your head movements and moves the cabin view to the position you are looking at, maybe some day. Recent talk is about Multi Player Mods, which seems to be tempting, but it is only in a Public Alpha state. We'll keep an eye on that too.",

Overall the game mechanics are great, each job pays well enough to make you want to keep playing but doesnt pay enough to make the game too easy. You really get attached to the trucks you buy, you invest time and money into your buisness and your trucks.  The buisness owning aspect of the game is fantastic, you can plan to start a company asap by taking out a loan, or you can save up for a while to avoid being in debt, there is so many possibilities. The graphics are great, The driving mechanic is litterally flawless and this game is as close as you can get to the real thing.  However this game does have minor issues. The A.I. is very wacky, sometimes getting you into an extremely costly accident making your 1 hour journey worthless. There is no visible damge on the trucks, so you can crash head on into a barrier and your truck would look brand new. The only other problem is if you are a new player, the frequent fines can really drain your bank account.  Overall I love this game, you should too, What are you waiting for?",

Just a little further, just get to the next city, just one more one more trip.  I don't really have any interest in trucks, but I have still put alot of hours into this game. Both relaxing and rewarding. You level up with each trip, so there is a good sense of progression and even a basic RPG element as well. With many other games today having a very open world and tons of possibilities, there is something appealing about something utterly simple like getting from point A to point B. No real choices or stragies to make, just do it. Probably not a thing for everybody, but give it a try even though it looks boring on paper.",

            "review_text": "Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a truck simulation game created by SCS Software, using OpenGL. It is the sequel to Euro Truck Simulator, with a redone physics and game engine. The player can drive across a significant part of Europe. Player should pick up a variety of cargoes, and delivering them to the desired destination. The game features 8 different trucks, includes: DAF, Volvo, Man, Scania, Renault, M. Benz and Iveco. 4 of them are licensed already.  Gameplay You can start your game in one of the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. You will be asked to select your desired city in one of them. Your garage will be located there. So the journey will be begin. In the beginning, you wont have enough money and experience to buy a truck, so you will start with quick deliveries. You also can get loans. You can open your own company, hiring drivers from all over the map. What you need is to have enough money to afford their trucks purchase and a free slot in a garage. You can buy a garage in every city you tend, Then you should upgrade it.  The gameplay is so sweet and handy. Its obvious how the developers have worked on it. and they have done it nicely. Riding trucks seems so realistic with a great system of handling. So after delivering any cargo, you will be given an amount of money and EXP will be gained. EXP is needed to unlock trucks and items. As you gain an amount of EXP, you earn a level as well. You also will be estimated as your level in the game. The system of opening of company makes a motivation for the player. Its almost the goal of the game. AI of the vehicles in ETS 2 is actually OK. its average, but they are making it better with every patch to make the game an awesome experience for the player. Accidents are not so realistic. Plus you wont get any physical damage. After any accident your truck will be damaged, but not physically. actually nothing happens to your truck. Its a defect. The game physic is good and its being improved by every patch.  You wont see any police in the game. But there are traffic lights, speed limit, toll stops and accident penalty. if you violate any mentioned things [except toll], you should pay an specific amount of fine. This systems made without any defect. The driver will become tired, so you should pull over in an specific place to get rest. Gas stations, repair stations, drivers agencies, Truck showplaces and resting stations are available in the game. For buying a truck, you need to visit its shop [which are in its own particular city] or you can use online purchasing. Any truck needs a slot in your garage. The limitation of slots is 5 in per garage. Also drivers you can hire are limited at 116 at the moment. Overall, this part of the game is decent. except some defects like lack of physical damages. Also the map is so much big. thats a fantastic point. so much to explore with a great system of running company that let you enjoy the title for many days.   Graphic The graphics are stunning. Lighting system and shadows are awesome. Vegetables, trees and environments made perfectly. Designing of trucks is amazing. Into the cabin has very good details with a perfect designing. But designing cities are kinda average. You also can see humans in the cities. There are also some famous places made in the game. Cargoes have a good variety. Weather system is great. Raining seems so realistic. You can enjoy the darkness of the night, the sunset, the sunrise and the sunlight in the middle of the noon. Also Other vehicles seem average. This part is one of the most important factors that makes this simulator so special, and puts it as the best truck simulator ever made.  Sound Well, the sound effects part is nothing special. I cant really talk about this. The sound seems so low when you are into the cabin camera. You should switch to another camera mode to hear it better. Its overall made well. There is also online radio streaming. Its decent. Also you can make your customized track list from your own music library.",

At the moment, the game is also incompatible with Intel cards on Linux, which is kind of annoying.  Throughout the UK and other countries you can see landmarks which are the same as in real life and for example, the ratio of motorways to smaller roads in Poland feels accurate. Cities also feel realistic, with some real life features being added to give a specific feel to every city. For example, you can see the local city hall in the background as you drive through Olsztyn.  With the Going East! DLC installed, there's a wide variety of places you can go. There's also a variety of mods which add more features to the game if you get bored.

They've really impressed me with this game...with all the extra stuff they've added. It took me a while to get the hang of the new steering system, but once I did I found it to be much easier and less jerky than before.  It's much more realistic, and I've even seen pedestrians in this game. I just saw a jumbo jet land as I was driving down the motorway.  They've added many more ferry services, toll roads and even level crossings. I thought they were just decoration but nope, I saw a train earier with the barrier and lights and everything.  Customisation is a great addition, although the extra lights don't really help unless you have high beams on, and the other drivers don't like that...flashing me when I'm using them.  The AI has been improved too. For example, in Euro Truck SIm 1, if there was a blockage of any kind, the AI cars just sat there with their hazard lights flashing. If you were behind them, you had to find an alternate route, ot barge through...bad idea. This time, the AI doesn't just sit there. I'll give you a quick example. I was coming up to a junction, and saw a lot of stationary traffic. Yep, blockage. There was a bus trying to turn left, but a truck was trying to turn right and they'd kinda blocked each other. The other road had cars trying to go but this bus was stopping things. I thought I was gonna have to drive round, but nope...I was shocked to see the bus actually reversing into a better turning position, turn then drive on it's way. The truck then did the same, turning into the right road...end of blockage and all was well.  The AI even wait at the on-ramps for it to become clear, and even go into the petrol stations now. It's much more realistic and enjoyable.  Although, the AI isn't perfect. Right of way is still a mystery to them. I was driving down a main street, and the cars on either side of the junction should've waited for me to pass before driving out, but nope...at the last moment a truck came out and I couldn't avoid it. That's the only bad thing I can say about this game...but if you know about it, you can avoid it.  9/10 rating from me because of the little flaws (lights and AI), but other than that I'm really enjoying this game.",

However, its a lot more fun than it originally sounds, and for some reason, it's kept me coming back for more.  When you first start the game, you are asked to create a company for your trucking business. When you start, you don't have enough capital or credit to take out a loan, so you just take 'quick missions' running freight from European city to city. This serves as a pretty good introduction to the game, and allows you to get a good feel for how the game plays. This is what drew me in. I had a lot more fun than you'd expect attaching the back of the trailer to the truck and driving it around the roads. There's not much actual city driving, as the cities themselves are pretty small. But that's okay. As I found out one day, I really am not playing this game to sit in traffic, so if there was just a bunch of city with cars, I don't think I'd like it very much. Sure, it would be more 'real', but sometimes you should sacrifice reality for fun.  After you get the trailer hitched up, you roll out of the industrial park you picked it up in and get on the road. This game doesn't work with a controller, as there are too many buttons to push to fit on a controller. You need to use you turn indicators, check your mirrors and change your views. You need to drive inside the lines, not hit other cars, and generally just obey all traffic laws. Again, this sounds really boring, but when you finally get to your destination, and you haven't hit anyone, its pretty rewarding. It also helps most cars drive faster than you, so you don’t have to play that annoying weaving game of trying to pass cars because they drive 20 MPH below the speed limit.   When you get enough capital, you can take out a loan and buy your own truck. The trucks they have for sale are all real trucks, and all have different stats and strengths. You then can take missions for your business and every mission has advantages and disadvantages (eg, the dangerous cargo gives you the most money). Every mission your complete (quick job or company mission) gives you experience and level up various stats, such as levels of dangerous cargo, increased fuel efficiency, and increased money for each mission. I haven’t got too far into the business side of the game, but I hear you can hire other drivers to work for you.  Overall, I enjoy this game thoroughly. For some reason, it’s compelling to come back just drive by the trees and fields of Europe, even if they're not the real thing.",

You start off by making a company, then pick your preffered type of truck, I chose Volvo. Then off you go driving borrowed trucks for companies during deliveries, it's either that til you can afford your own truck, or borrow money from the bank.  later in the game you drive to the companies to do deliveries in your own trucks, there are a couple types of deliveries; fragile cargo, dangerous cargo, valuable cargo, and short time deliveries. You have to upgrade your skills to get the more valuable ones and to get deliveries with further distances.  You can upgrade your base of operations and purchase more of them, you can hire managers and drivers, you also have to purchase trucks for your drivers. I'm not that far into the game though, I've got a pimped up truck and little cash left, and at around 30 hours it's still not getting boring yet!  Got a gaming wheel? Excellent! Much more fun with a gaming wheel. although it doesn't seem to have full compatibility yet, i ended up turning the sensitivity for turning up to full. It doesn't seem to have much support for force feedback either, but it's still pretty fun. Oh, and did i mention it works with gears? Thats right, with the G27 or similar gaming wheel, you have a gear case thingy! You can choose between the increadibly difficult advanced gearing system based on the real manual trucks, or the normal H configuration you'll find in most cars. by the way, i hope you know how to pop a clutch, this game supports that.  I recommend picking this game up on steam when it's on sale though, since there's only a couple months left til the holidays. Did i forget anything? Anyway, let's hope they update their support for gaming wheels!",

Anyway, ETS 2 is pretty cool, especially since they patched in the ability to get rid of the speed limiter. It turns it into a very different game, delivering stuff as fast as possible, using the entire road as you dodge all the cars moving slower than you because Europeans don't know how to drive.  I mean that's assuming everyone in Europe drives like the people in this game do. Which I seriously hope they don't, because holy crap. Wow.

I have approximately 20 hours in the game, and that's about where I'd say most users that would be interested in this, would get to. For someone more casual, and not into the 'sim' genre (think... the person that plays flight simulator, and the first thing they do is nose it over into the ground because they wanted to see what the crash looked like)... you're probably looking at about 5 hours.  Pros: The game is good, it's well oiled, and a complete package. You'll have no problem picking it up, driving for miles, and running an RPG style trucking company if you'd like, or you could simply roam about in the countryside racking up speeding fines.  Cons: They types of loads get a bit repetitive, and I think the developers are missing a HUGE opportunity for a CHALLENGING trucking sim. Spin Tires goes further than it needs to (though still a FANTASTIC game), but where Spin Tires is all mud, and challenge... ETS2 is all highway, and cruise control. Adding a variety of loads to carry, and the challenge of mountain trucking, or big city fuel tanker deliveries, etc... would make this game much more interesting.  Still, the mod community is strong. I prefer not to mod, since they're largely just skins, which I find provide nothing more than (no pun) a skin deep experience.  Buy it if: You're fascinated by running a freight business as an owner/operator, and enjoy the long haul aspects of FSX.  Skip it if: You're looking for something that requires you to think your way through something, or do more than remember to indicate properly, and back a big rig into a loading dock. True story, I've fallen asleep while driving on the virtual highway on a longhaul... which is probably realistic... but not the kind of realism I want in a game.  I'm giving it a 7/10 if you don't mod. I wish there was more variety in the challenge of loads (long loads, doubles, triples, oversized, etc.), and the traffic AI seems to leave something to be desired.",

However, if you are looking for something unique that isn't dealing death to millions of identikit villains or being a one-person saviour of the universe, why not give Euro Truck Simulator 2 (ETS2) a try?  I recently moved from Xbox 360 back to the PC scene. In the years that I had an Xbox, I found that I really missed the kind of games that only PC has. Games where essentially nothing happens. The world won't end if you don't achieve your objective.  This is why I like ETS2.  This is an extremely well-supported game. The publishers regularly issue free updates (not just bug fixes, but additional cities, road networks, trucks, etc).   I have sunk hours into this game just driving a truck from one city to another, and then another city, etc. It is a great way to while away time with no stress. Although the roads and cities are very loosely based on the real-life versions, I don't think that you could ever hope to compare game vs. real-world with any degree of accuracy. Having said that, there are certain roads that I have travelled in-game and in real-life and found myself thinking 'wow, they got that right!', so must be an element of consideration of the real-world road network.  Controls were initially an issue, but a recent update fixed that with proper Xbox controller support. Performance-wise, the game has never crashed or had any technical problems at all. It runs at max settings on my PC (which is fairly high-spec, so I would expect that!)  My main criticisms are minor; the graphics can seem a little bleached out / over-saturated (in HDR mode especially), sometimes the AI drivers create a bottleneck where they all block a junction waiting for a vehicle to turn - this causes the lane that the vehicle needs to cross to become blocked (I had to barge my way through the roadside to get past!). Another minor complaint is that the roads seem very under-populated. If possible, there needs to be an option to increase AI traffic.  All in all, I love ETS2 and would recommend it to anyone looking for a game to pass time in.",

Once you have created your company in the menus you can take on quick jobs that provide you with a truck and all of your fuel is paid for. Then once you've earned enough money you can buy your own truck and drive freely to any location on the map. You are constantly gaining experience points that make jobs payout more. You can upgrade certain skills that unlock bigger cargos to haul around. There are quite a few choices of trucks to buy.  The is being updated regularly and new features are always fun to play with. A recent update gave you three extra cities to drive to at no extra cost which I thought was pretty special. The only dissapointment with the game is that there are no complete cities to explore. When you come off the motorway you have access to a series of roads connecting the different company depots, repair stations and truck dealers.

Beside that, you have the possibility to easily mod the game to use third party trucks, trailers, AI, weather, even entirely new map mods. And if this is not enough there is also a multiplayer mod which is absolutely free to use, made by a passionate community group of modders. Graphics are astonishing and sometimes the views you encounter are just amazing. Phisics are pretty good although they could be further improved. Real truck drivers I have talked to, who are playing the game, said the trucks behave close to real ones and are pretty accurate.  On the negative side I believe the AI is the thing that still needs improvements, though it has been overhauled recently. Things like not giving way at some roundabouts and just driving into you or not keeping the distance when you try to maneuver in tight intersections should be addressed. But I'm sure most of us forget about these things when driving on highways or country roads, with the radio on and the turbocharger whistling at you when you press the accelerator.

Steering wheel support is great too!  The game simply involves your journey as a truck driver, start of hiring your skills out to other companies , until you can afford a truck of your own, then strike out to build your empire, hire drivers, buy more trucks and garages , get rich!  You can customise your truck and all the options to play exactly how you want , things like realism of fuel usage , driver fatigue, probability of rain etc. can all be adjusted, you are penalised for being caught speeding, crashing, driving the wrong way up roads etc. all in all its pretty damn good fun , allot more so with a steering wheel and pedals.  I'll end my saying the game has a s**t tonne of content, Im 20 hours in and Ive only just paid off the bank loan I took out to buy my own truck, all the drivers, garages, better trucks, modifications, I havent even scratched the surface.......",

That's pretty much all there is to it. On the surface it sounds incredibly boring and like something that would only appeal to a niche audience, but oddly enough it works. While the game can be modded to satisfy the hardcore sim fan, the vanilla game is very simple and not at all the kind of in-depth driving sim you might expect. Once you get used to the controls, driving becomes much easier and eventually you're just sort of 'in the zone.' Listen to a podcast or an audio book. Just chill. really if I had any complaints about the game it's that there are no in-game guides of any kind on what exactly certain traffic laws are in certain places, so there are occasions where you may find yourself getting tickets for things you weren't expecting. Maybe this is a glitch, but it seems like driving around central Europe you would have to be a psychopath to get a fine, but the second you set foot (or in this case, set tire) in Britain, you get speeding and lane-change fines up the ♥♥♥♥, yet it is not entirely clear what limits you are breaking.

When you start to drive the trucks, you can really feel the weight and power that I imagine it must feel like to be a truck driver. The modelling of not only the trucks, but also the AI cars is outstanding. The sounds are almost spot on. The roads offer differing degrees of difficulty. You can imagine you are really behind the wheel of your favourite truck, whether it be Scania, MAN or Volvo, or one of the other trucks in the game. The design of the menu system is beautiful and simplistic. It is easy to use. The addition of a mod menu is another plus, even though SCS Software does not support them. There are many mods out there but I definitely recommend the Jazzycat Trailer mods. The world is absolutely gorgeous if you are fortunate enough to be able to run it at high settings. The only down side to this game (I feel) is that, in my opinion, there isn't enough road. So if you are a trucker at heart, I recommend this game. It is constantly being fixed and worked on, and you are usually lucky enough to find it on sale. So load up and get on the road! Happy trucking!",

(its where you load your truck with food and such and then drive to multiple smaller stores and unload a bit of your cargo at each place, could maybe work with a mod, but would be best if it was official) and also, loading the cargo manually with forklifts would be AMAZING, although it might have to wait untill ETS 3.",

Then couple weeks later, I though 'let's play this for a few hours, then I probably put it into steam category 'trash'. Well after few hours playing this I played another few. And another few. And... you get it.   * Graphics is nice, but not astonishing, although I like the weather effects from clouds to sun shafts at the horizon. * Sounds are ok I guess (did not drive a tuck myself, though ;) ). And I like the real radio you can use ingame. * Controls are very good! You cannot just use nearly every controller and set everything to anything - but I even attached 2 XBox controllers which can be configured completely seperately - this way I don't have to use the keyboard at all while playing on the couch! Dont know any other game which can do this. * AI is fine, too. Reacts to line change and turn signals, slows down if you do. Sometimes can really suck if no one lets you pass the crossing ;) * Game mechanics for a relatively simple simlulator are good, too. Apart from driving around you can also manage several garages, nearly every town has one you can buy. Still you're mostly driving around, but I think it's a nice motivation for in between to manage garages and hired drivers :) * Also you can modify your truck; choose engine, extra lights, sun block etc. And you can give it nice extra paint jobs with totally custom colors. (And don't buy the color DLCs, in my opinion they're not worth it &gt;.&gt; ) * Still gets patched; after the Scandinavia DLC, performance went downhill in several areas, but couple of weeks later that got fixed.   As I have no clue, why I actually like this, I cannot say 'buy this, if you like... '. But if you got a controller/wheel, you might give it a try; the base game gets pretty cheap in sales anyway, so that would be a nice stop to try it.

The game looks great, gives you easy access to online radios and the world is just perfect. I really like truck customization too!

When I was playing those games, I wouldn`t imagined that company going to be bigger and release a game like Euro Truck Simulator 2 !   The first disapointment when I played 18 Wos: American Long Haul after 18:WOS Haulin, because it was the same game and the only difference was brand new a truck, new 2 or 3 cities and women drivers. There was no patches and updates...  Well, then, they made ETS, which is first euro truck. And it was another map and different trucks, I really liked it. Then they made those 2 games which shows company is growing which are Trucks and Trailers and Scania Truck Driving Simulator... Me and my enviroment was knew these two games are just games like demo and to make budget for actual game which is Euro Truck Simulator 2. I played those games too and after Scania Truck Driving Simulator, I got excited about ETS2.  They released ETS2. Map was good, there was many bugs and many of trucks was not official such as Volvo, Mercedes etc... Then they start updating almost every week. And game extremely developed. Current situation of game is like another game if you consider with first ETS2.  All trucks are official and with real names and logos. Map is quite big and it has many things that makes you feel you are driving a real truck. You can set your seat, mirrors, you can use retarder to slow down and you can lift up/down your wheels if you are not carrying anything. With the DLC`s it is an amazing game, and you can download billions of mods for this game...   Major DLC`s are map DLC`s. If you are going to buy with DLC`s I strongly recommend buy with Scandinavia DLC and Going East.   The best developers and best game I have ever seen in my life. Many of games on Steam are abondoned games by developers. But this game is alive and still keeps developing !",

It seems like if you try to match the posted speed limit in km per hour, there are dudes passing you all over the place. And if you try to match it on miles per hour, you get speeding violations.

That leaves one 750 hp monster for me to pull large, heavy loads at high speeds all over the land (and you'd better hope I remember which side of the road to drive on, lest you meet 30 tons of high speed steel head on). Oh yeah, did I mention that those 86 drivers are dumping their profits into MY company account? That has allowed me to buy and operate 17 garages all over the place (and still looking at where to expand next).  All of that aside, this game is the one I fire up for a few minutes, to play something fun and calm when I get burned out from killing bandits/orcs/enemy soldiers/zombies/etc... What I find amusing is that those few minutes usually end up being 5-10 hours due to grabbing 'just one more run'. The driving is that much fun for me.  The game is worth the MSRP, and is a real steal when on sale, and the DLC is very reasonably priced. Get it. You won't be disappointed. Oh, yeah...

The devs are also realsing skins for particular events witch is a nice idea to keep the game more interseting people not wanting to get there game modded besides they are cheap compared to games like CS:G more bang for buck :)  So dont go say this game is anthor sim thats waisting your money and time.

The fact that you can create your own lifestyle as a trucker and have your own company grows on you quite quickly.  What I enjoy mostly about this game and that makes it extremely unique is the fact that you can put your own music into the Document file of this game and simply hit the radio with your favorite songs and relax to the awesome scenery that this game offers 9.3/10 - Simply astonishing.",

            "review_text": "I 'technically' played ETS 2 long before American Truck Simulator, but I had only tried the beginning tutorial and then promptly forgot about it. Since I enjoyed ATS so much I thought I would give this game a second chance.   While playing ETS you get a much better feeling of scale since it covers much more area than the American version currently and that it is scaled at 1:19 versus 1:34 for ATS. What this means is that if you take a job that requires you to drive from one end of the map to the other you better be prepared to sit awhile. Another change is if you don't live in Europe the road system in ETS may feel similar, but different. If you have never had any experience with roundabouts or driving an English vehicle from the right hand side then ETS will give you the opportunity to see if you can handle it while carrying tons of cargo.  A few complaints that I had in ATS do carry over to ETS2. There is no visual damage model which for me seems very odd for a driving sim with big trucks, but it is what it is I guess. Also what can hurt your truck is very annoying at times. Heaven forbid you hit a small wooden fence while trying to make a turn because not only is it going to damage your truck, but it also is going not move an inch. The driver AI can be a tad crazy or downright suicidal depending on the situation. I've seen AI cars merge in front of trucks and then hard break while on the highway when there was no reason to do so.  In short if you already like ATS or you have ever wanted to drive around a very nice 'mini' version of central Europe then give ETS2 a try. If you end up enjoying the game be sure to try out some of the great mods out there such as Pro Mods.",

The game allows expansion to many garages(you start with one) and you can upgrade each one along with the trucks you own, eventually hiring drivers to drive one of your trucks and bring in money for you. Eventually you can have drivers everywhere raking in more money than you can handle and you can either keep on driving or sit back and crash cars to spend the money you probably won't need on repairs because you're bored and crashing cars is something to do. There is a multiplayer mod in progress and it absolutely changes the game, especially when you can be trucking with your friends in a convoy. AMAZING GAME.",

Would be nice if you could not cheat the system in such a mode and maybe have a reputation system in which you can compete against other virtual companies for contracts. And maybe even more like transport tycoon in which you can buy out competition. :)  very fun and replayable/10.",

It is very moddable and while it requires skill to mod it there are plenty of mods to get the experence you want if the base game bores you. The AI can be annoying but there are mods for that...or just be paitent and understanding to the little AI. The map can get stale after many hours but that can be fixed with map mods if you want to mod them in. It also takes very little storage space which is great for a cluttered PC if that is your case. I would recommend this game many times over to anyone and will continue to play it and any other games after it for quite some time and am excited to see what SCS has to offer in the future!",

With this sim, you'll experience whether patters, speed cameras, fines for not abiding to driving regulation laws (not sleeping or not turning on your lights), and other annoying things like a fine for crashing into another motorist, and penalty deductions at the end of your trip for damaging the cargo.  You can also modify your truck through the dealers, selecting different trims, lights, horns, bull bars etc for your truck, each manufacturer has a wide selection of vehicles available, not all at once though, you'll have to level up for the hugh powerplant you want.  Not forgetting you can hire staff, buy them trucks to driver, make sure you go for the stat level you can afford as their price per mile differs at their current skill level, go for someone low and it'll take a while for them to level up nicely but when they do you'll get some real $$$, but beware, go for a higher level person for the cash to be brought in now, and you'll find later on they probably arent someone you're going to keep on the books.  In my experience it can sometimes get a little tiring, if you slip up at the end of the journey and have a HUGH crash, that 1200mile trip was pretty much worthless or even cost you money.  Over all I quite like this game, nearly even love it - managing my own truck, my business with staff and stats to manage is right up my street, I can decide to play business man for an hour or simply get in my truck, pick a job and drive - if this sounds like you, then get this game.",

The game I is very adictive, well I think so, but I have always liked to drive even in reality. Pity that the makers of the game don't iron out the bugs properly as the humps in the roads (speed humps). The first patch for Going East was great, it ironed out the humps in the road from the original game, but can't install it due to it being obsolete.

Since the Winter sale was on, I got the Deluxe pack for insanely cheap. As soon as I started I knew I was hooked, I don't have a wheel but it works really well with a 360 controller.  There's really no way to describe WHY the game is fun, you just have to try it out. I find it super relaxing and can listen to radio streams, my music, podcasts etc. Plus SCS seems to be constantly working on improving the game, be it the DLC, getting the real truck licences, adding the World of Trucks website (which has me hooked on Photo Mode like Gran Turismo 4 did back in the day).   If I can offer a few areas of improvement, it's the following: - Instead of having prohibitory signs on areas you can't go, add like, an accident, or road work, detour signs, etc or something more realistic as the floating signs make it more like NFS and take away immersion.  - Allow changing the GPS colours in options. I'm partially colour blind and green arrow on yellow road intersection was next to impossible for me to see at distance. Had to create/pack a basic mod editing the cfg file just to make it usable.  - In truck cabin sounds are much too quiet, I couldn't even hear the traffic. See above, had to pack a basic mod.  - During the tutorial make mention of the difference between POSTED speed limit and the truck speed limit (shown on the GPS). I'm not from Europe so wasn't aware of these regs and had to look it up thinking my GPS was broken. - More varied traffic vehicles like Fire trucks, Ambulances, Police cars. You added buses which is cool! - Would prefer ALL the DLC in the deluxe pack, even if it means replacing an older game included or an Ultimate edition as I'll personally probably never play the first ETS and would have preferred the added paint jobs and cabin interiors.  Those are literally me nitpicking to make the review more balanced, if you aren't convinced play the demo.",

No certain jobs to do, untill you choose one and unlike most games you start with almost nothing (you get some money from doing tutorial). It really does feel like you are running your own truck company, that is when you get the money. for the size of the world it is amazing that there are no parts that you need to wait as your driving like in oblivion in the wild it says loading area and in farming truck simulator when you want to drive into town its a 2 minute wait, ETS 2 is just smooth driving all the way around. The bugs on ETS 2 are decreasing and after 5 hours of playing i havn't encountered 1 bug. Small additions in ETS 2 make the game beautiful and there a lot in ETS 2 like the spray of water when other cars drive in rain, the aeroplanes lifting of from places that have an airport, and the many mods that can make it snow, custom cars, custom trailers and new cab designs. Although some people arn't really too keen on simulators i encourage all to atleast download the free demo to see what its like.  London to Paris. Paris to Amsterdam. Amsterdam to Sheffield.  Growing your business every step of the way. Overall Rating 9/10",

Pros - Very Fun &amp; Relaxing (If your not speeding) - Has third party multiplayer support (truckersMP, but beware if your in Australia or NZ there are no servers for us. The best you can get is hong kong but no one plays on that server, so you will most likely be on europe 2 in which you ping will be 200-250 (IF YOU HAVE NBN TO YOUR HOME) If you have ADSL then you will be stuck on about 300 ping. - Has a good variety of truck branding.  - Map is fairly large - Has decent graphics &amp; is well optimised for lower end PC's - Has great wheel support &amp; sounds.  Cons - Can be repetitive and you feel as if you have been to an area even if you havent been there before as alot of the textures such as the tress and grass are used alot. It seems most areas have the same city styling and country road styling. - AI isnt exactly amazing but it isnt the worst I have seen.   Overall a really good game especially if you have another friend or 2 to play with.

Here's my story:  -Installed game. -Made a new profile -Looked for the goofiest looking person -Chose a Volvo, because it's the only company that I recognize from North America -Chose the Fire company symbol, because I wanted my company to be hot -Got in game -Had to drive to a destination -After twenty minutes of trying to park, I skipped it -Finished first trip  -Took a quick job -Tipped when trying to get onto the freeway on the round connecting thing (What's that called again?) -Respawned back in Rotterdam -Happened again -Quit the job, took a fine -Quit the profile, time for a new one  This is how my Euro Truck life went for four or five more profiles. I finally found multiplayer, and decided I could stick to one profile  -Almost got banned for being a bad driver. -Played on Multiplayer for a while with friends, becoming a better driver. -Rammed my driving buddy into a wall. He was threatning to take my lane, and I stood up to him. -Haven't played with him since.  After this, I decided it was time for DLC.   -Went to Scandinavia -Was impressed with new textures, scenery and more -After several hours of gameplay with the DLC, I decided I should write a review  This has been my ETS 2 life, I really enjoy this game, it's a blast, but very relaxing. If I had a choice of this and American Truck Simulator, I'd choose this. It's just got more things to do, for now.",

Just hop in your truck, turn on the radio, and diseapear into the land of the calm.   I definately recommend this game. But as every game, it's not for everyone.

            "review_text": "Graphics: This game is quite pretty. Nothing spectacular or mind-blowing, but there are moments when you have to balance driving and admiring the scenery without smashing into anything. There are also a few mods that can enhance your experience in this regard.  Audio: The music is pretty standard, but all of the other audio in the game is fantastic. The sounds of the vehicles are very realistic, especially since they have been updated over time. There are videos on the SCS website of how they record the engine noises, and it's very well done.  Gameplay: This is a very relaxing game. Not exciting by any means, but it can be quite satisfying to see your progress over time, and the driving can be enjoyable on its own. The progression itself is quite good. As you earn money, you'll be able to purchase other trucks for your company and hire drivers to operate them while you are on your own job to create additional revenue. You begin to snowball, and you eventually reach the point where money is no longer a concern, but that takes a considerable amount of time. You also earn XP, unlocking the ability to take more jobs. There is a decent variety of trucks in the base game to keep your interest, and this is one of those games that has an absolutely massive modding potential. There is a load of trucks, cargo, maps, truck parts, and more available to download to keep the game fresh. And don't let the DLC turn you away, as the majority of it is paint packs, which aren't necessary by any means. The other DLC, such as the Going East expansion, are superb.  TL;DR: This isn't really a game for everyone, but if you have interest, I do recommend picking it up on sale. It's a high-quality simulator, and it's very satisfying to progress in. Overall a great game to play to relax or chill while watching a video or listening to some music.",

Graphics, detail, variety, sounds, available jobs/missions, HUD (rearview mirrors, GPS, etc), and not to mention MUSIC. Yes this game has a radio that doesn't require you to manually put music into the game folder, but rather it streams music from the internet and there are a bunch of different stations to choose from. Plus, in this game, you can make your own company, have your own garage, hire drivers, and all that which is awesome. The driving and parking trailers in this game is more difficult than in the original, because it has more realistic physics, but that doesn't bother me much. It motivates me to get better.

In Euro Truck Simulator 2 you take the wheel of a tractor trailer across Europe. You start your own trucking company and make deliveries. As you progress the distance gets longer and the money you make increases. Honestly, this is one of the best simulator games around. It's a great way to just sit back, relax and pass the time peacefully. Nobody is yelling at eachother like in multiplayer games. The only thing you have to worry about is keeping your truck in its lane, not hitting other cars/trucks and stopping for red lights. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who loves driving games and who maybe looking to get into simulators.  Pros: -Great Time Passer -Good Graphics -Very Realistic -You Drive All Across Europe -Learn How to Manage Your Own Company  Cons: -There is none, buy this game.  Final Verdict: 10/10  da!",

But I'll be damned if it isn't amazing to look at. This game it superbly polished. The European countryside is beautiful to drive through; and when you add a real-world, streaming radio station on top of that, it's even more fun to drive around. I won't deny that I've decided to play 'one more job' just because a song that I love came on.  What's even better is that this game looks *gorgeous* in stereoscopic 3D. The truck cabin really comes to life; the mirrors float in space; the trees and buildings in the distance look like they're really in the distance! If you have an NVIDIA card, I really do recommend playing it in 3D. And if you connect it to a 3D TV (like I do), that's even better!  I haven't gotten to the point of getting a loan or starting a business. I don't know if I want to get into that kind of micromanagement.   But when I need some down time from the real world, I now have no problems hopping into a big 18-wheeler while listening to a European radio station, which came as a very pleasant surprise to me.

            "review_text": "I didn't want to apply a thumbs-down because this is a game that achieves a fair bit of what it set out to do, and is obviously a labour of love. Nice day/night changes, a peaceful feel to it, a chance to listen to MP3s in a fairly stress-free game, comfortable controls. It took me a while to get it set up, but I was soon chugging up hills at 15 mph.  I think my main disappointment was to do with expectations. The blurb says: 'dozens of cities to explore'. I didn't expect 1-to-1 fidelity, but to me, explore means at least they would feel like cities, and be vaguely recognisable. Much as I'd have loved it to be like driving through Google Street View, I had already scaled back my expectations. I assumed maybe cities would only have a third of the roads, something like that. I wasn't prepared for reaching Cardiff, a city I know well, and discovering that it seemed to be two roads and a depot. Likewise with Swansea. Ouch. I'd persuaded my girlfriend that we might be able to drive from our hometown across Wales, then on to Europe, and eventually down the coast of Italy, perhaps finding the town where some of our family live. Wrong. The vast majority of places in each country are missing. A few cities will exists as just a couple of roads, nothing like what you'd expect from Saints Row/GTA/Sleeping Dogs. Don't get me wrong, that would be great but I understand why things have been scaled down - I just think it's deceptive not to make that clear from the sales blurb. If that had stated that there were 40 urban areas out of the many thousands, and that cities were scaled down 1,000 times, and that places with populations of below a million weren't included, I'd have at least had an idea of how far the game is from reality. For example, the UK alone has 69 cities (and many thousands of towns and villages) but ETS2 only has 18, each of which is a few roads. Cities mainly act as just blobs on a map, connecting points. A grand tour of Europe this is not - it's a patchwork quilt edged by invisible walls (well, you can see them, big Xs and chevrons floating in the air to stop you heading towards landmarks or B-roads or anything that isn't a motorway). The map of Italy seemed to cut off at the very edge - so technically Italy is included, but only as a few clumps of road in a teeny area. It seems disingenuous. Most European countries don't seem to be in the game. This is a disappointment only because of the misleading advertising.  It seems you can listen to radio stations in game but I never got that to work, no matter how many URLs I added to a text document nested far down my hard drive hierarchy. No error messages - good luck if you aren't IT literate.  Finally, I think I'd have got a bit more pleasure from it if I could have also had the option of driving around in a car rather than a truck. It's weird that the game simulates many things; as a company owner you probably have a car, but there is no option to go anywhere in it. I'd have thought a free drive mode would have been a nice addition for people like me, who don't want a racing game, just something more sedate, but the chance to explore the small part of Europe that has been included at a bit more of a zippy pace. Still, that's a suggestion, not a criticism. The main feeling I had was one of disappointment at the scale of the game. It may be hundreds of miles wide, but the detail is only inches deep, a surface impression that didn't really satisfy me. I can see why others might be happy with it. Maybe a more accurate blurb would have helped, rather than trying to sell the Earth.  ---  I can't comment on my own review's comments thread due to some error (thanks Steam), so here's my response to the comment by HaddockA, who said 'You're seriously crazy to even think that such a game in 2016 could even exist... That's like having GTA V multiplied by a factor of 1,000.... you're seriously weird. .'  My reply: 'I probably am crazy but that's a separate issue. Having never played one of these games, but having used the free Google Street view which lets you do something similar, I don't see why it was crazy to imagine the game would map 33% of the roads, rather than 0.01% (or whatever the figure is). After all, it says 'cities to explore'. But you get there and there is nothing to explore. Just a few roads, one supermarket with an empty car park, and a background view you can't reach. If the blurb included what % of Europe's roads were included in the game then I'd be a fool to expect otherwise, but they don't include that information, thereby inviting inflated expectations.'",

When the game updates itself (and you can't do nothing about that), there's pretty high possibility that mods will not be compatible with that new version. This phenomenon is not problematic by itself. It's acceptable to some point, because mods are created by people not related to SCS and their mods behaviour isn't something that SCS should deal with. We can discuss if the editor should allow incompatibility issues with minor updates, but this is something for separate topic.  BUT, if the game itself allows you to install mods, it should allow you to fix old savegames (profiles) so you don't lose everything you gained so far, just because new game version can't work with old mod and at the same time. So, when new version can't work with old mod, it's not the worst one - you can't load old savegame at all, because game warns you that your savegame contains some data which depending on these very mods, so you're on your own. You can play it from scratch or to give up for good, as you have no option to postpone update or downgrade if something goes wrong.  I just can't understand why SCS is unable to offer savegame update or at least clound profile data with we can import in freshly created savegame, to continue where we stopped?  OK, I'm ready to lose my beloved mods, wider coverage and better equipment, but some of them are stock and should be working.  So, I'm sorry, but this is a big dealbreaker for me.",

            "review_text": "Why I don't recommend this game? The reasons are many but the main is the game doesn't feel at all like truck simulator and the game is not challenging at all.  1. Lack of police - as much as we don't like them lurcking behind some bush IRL, the cops are absolutely necessary in this game. I was so disappointed when I found out there is no police on the roads. This kills like the half of the realism. You can drive with top speed on the highway without worring you can be pulled over for speeding, driving on shoulder or wrong lane or whatever. There are only few speed cameras and if you don't see the signs and get a ticked you can just quick load the quick save you made like 5 seconds ago and everything will be fine. Which leads to my number 2 reason.  2. Quick Saves - this option should not exist while driving. You can make quick saves every 5 seconds and if anything bad happens like get ticket, crash, miss exit or whatever you are just one quick load away. This is an exploit that can kill the joy of every player. Some of you will say 'then just don't use it' ... well there is one very bad human trait - temptation. When you know it is there sometimes you can't resist. You should be able to sava game while you are on the road only on resting areas.  3. Lack of routes - in this game there are onle highways and main roads. There is lack of options where you can choose to take different highways / IRL sometimes you prefer to travel longer but cheaper/. 3.1 - You can't choose to take a 'risky' route which can be shortcuts but it have restrictions for trucks and get pulled by cops and get a ticket /which leads to number 1./ or be stuck in low bridge which IRL can happen very often if you haven't checked the route before. There are no unknow roads that you can take the risk and explore.  4. No traffic jams near or in cities - this is one of every driver's /truck or car driver/ nightmare. To be on the wrong Highway at the wrong time of the day ... and be late for the delivery. Cities are very simply made in this game, and they look almost all the same, no matter if you are in France or Poland. No real traaffic experience. And even if you get 'stuck' on red light intersection you can just 'quick load' and all the traffic is gone! Wow .. magic!  5. Who gives a crap about signals and that kind of stull, right?  Maybe it sounds like hate, but this is my honest oppinion about the game. I had very big expectations because of the rating it has, but in my scale this game deserves no more than 5 out of 10. It needs more challenge, it needs more realism",

            "review_text": "Yes this game cost less than a gallon of gas, so how upset can I be? Reading the other reviews and seeing that this game has an 'Overwhelming Positive Response', I jumped on the sale price. I enjoy driving games and thought this would add a nice sim/management complexity to the typical 'racing' game. First off I don't think this is meant for anyone that doesn't have a full blown steering wheel/dashboard setup. There are way too many options to fully enjoy this game with a typical controller and driving games definitely lose something with a keyboard. It reminds me of something I learned when I got my game design degree, it was a Design class about how you really need to pay attention to the user interaction aspect of your design; to do that you need users to test and give feedback. A few examples of what I mean, if you have a game controller selected or a steering wheel, the menus should default to the selectable options only, no reason I should have to control a mouse pointer or at least give me a back/close button so I don't have to move the pointer all over the screen. The number of buttons it takes to really feel like you are driving is crazy in this game: Gas, Brake, Steering, POV, Turn Signals, Light, Camera View, Menu, wipers, etc. Not to mention setting these up on a controller, first you go into the control to set the steering, POV, Gas, Brake and Shifting. Then you have to go into the Keyboard menu to set the other functions. Why? It makes zero sense to have a Controller Menu but make me go into the keyboard menu to set it up. Ok, so let's say you can overlook that, it seems petty (and it probably is if this didn't have 2 in the title.) Now I agree with the majority when it comes to game play, there is something relaxing about loading up a couple hours of music and driving, while building an empire. But again, I have at least one major issue, the second freight job I took, when I was backing up to line up with the trailer, I misjudged and hit it instead. It proceeded to tip over, now the only option I have is to forfeit that job and loose $12,000. Although I can't verify this since I can't attach the trailer, but I suspect the trailer damage doesn't start to register till it is hooked up to the truck. If that is the case, why would they not incorporate some functionality to the trailer that it stays up right until attached (a switch built into the Unreal Engine, so it is possible). Now this also could be explained away possibly as realism, but part of the design process in anything is to manage the user’s frustration levels. Something like this could be handled like all other accidents I've had so far, a deduction in the total earnings. I sustained damage to my truck and I will lose almost all my money. Even in real life I would be able to call someone to flip the trailer over, but in the game it sunk into the ground. All in all, if you are looking for a few hours of relaxation, and you don't mind a few minutes of frustration and stumbling around trying to configure the game so you can play it, go for it. If you are looking for an improved sequel, this may not be it (although not having played the first, I can't say it's not improved.) I will reiterate, if this game was not a sequel I probably would have a totally different opinion, but the fact that the start of the game (set up and initial game play) are so frustrating, I tend to believe the entire game is riddled with this kind of stuff.  To the design team: make sure the player can jump in and control the game with minimal effort; first impressions are paramount.",

One of the main reasons that prevented me from enjoying this game was the steering:  Steering the truck does not have a realistic feel to it. The steering is not smooth (even when trying and making many different adjustments via the options screen). Steering required constant tweaking back and forth to keep the truck in the lanes and in no way did I ever feel like I was steering a real vehicle. Driving a real vehicle I don’t have to constantly keep ‘on top’ of my steering wheel like you do in this ‘game’. I never felt like I could ever relax like I do when driving on a real road trip.  Other factors for giving this game a thumbs down:  There was not a wide variety of roads; after a while the road design repeated types of roads I had already driven in other locations.  Even though there is a large amount of locations, the locations were not even close to true representations and the location design started repeating just like the roads.  For me, there are way more fun and enjoyable games out there than to waste time on this one.  Also, I wonder if a large portion of the favorable reviews for this game are fabricated in order to drive up profits; note the metacritic reviews average a good amount lower than the steam reviews.",

The game does not provide any realistic simulation as far as driving goes. 90% of the dashboard does not work, trucks do not have real world physics. Driving is boring, because your truck drives like a toy, because there's no skill involved to do it. Truck has horn lights and turn signals, but they don't matter, the Ai don't see or hear them. There is no visual damage, dirt or tire wear.  The trailers/equipment you pull has no weight to them, you look in your rearview mirror and they are going all the road because there is no physics attributed to the trailers.  It rains but you cannot slide, and it doesn't change your driving. Rain on the windshield is the only thing that changes, there is no physics so your truck is not going to slide or slip. There is no snow.  Sound is laughable in the game, there's hardly any, trucks sound OK outside, but inside they are muffled too much. No city or freeway sounds, it's so bad there are several mod's for sound. As much as the developers keep recording they don't seem to get it right.  AI of course is stupid and their behavior will cause you to get in several accidents. Things you will notice right away, there are no police in Europe, or ambulances or fire trucks, in fact all of Europe only owns about five different cars. And no motorcycles. You can get tickets for speeding or running a red light, a little bell goes off in a popup that says you just paid for your infraction.  Your business, you're able to hire employees, who you will never see, you must purchase trucks for them. No reason for that company logo you'll never see your driver's trucks on the road.   There are mod's that help with some of the games shortcomings, unfortunately you have to go looking for them because for some reason the developer will not form a nexus for mod's even though the community has asked. Make sure your antivirus is up to date when you go mod's hunting.   A lot of people voted to green light this game, to bringing it mainstream because it had a lot of potential to be a real world truck simulator, but the developer has just just sat on it. He wants the game more assessable to the younger players but still wants to call it a simulator for some reason.

Going around turns I kept losing control of the rig and going into the ditch as my two trailers behind me could keep violently swerve every time I would attempt one of my spilt second 90 degree turns using the keyboard.

Yes, there are maps of Europe with the major cities in the right places, more or less, and there are even some famous buildings somewhere on the horizon to look at, but that doesn't make up for the complete mess that the rest of the map is. Not even the major highways are in any way like they are in reality. I understand that they had to shrink the map to fit the game, and there is nothing wrong about that. I wouldn't want to sit there for 3 hours driving a truck from Frankfurt to Cologne. But even the shrinking should have allowed them to at least keep the proper relations and connections between the major highways, and they just didn't. I drove through areas where I know the highways really well, and except for the right numbers there was nothing that looked at all familiar. Really, once you're on the highway, everything looks like a mostly randomly generated landscape with very generic and sometimes completely unfitting regional tints. On top of that, the roads have a very simple structure that repeats over and over, so there's really nothing to do than listening to the radio... which is nicely done in the game.  You can buy this if you want a Truck Simulator, but don't expect anything from the 'Euro' part.",

The idea of driving a virtual truck appealed to me, but discovering roads and distances are not realistic at all made me stop this game very quickly. Hopefully this will get patched one day but i highly doubt that will happen in this release.",

There is no pratical or functional improvements or whatsoever. The traffic cars or AI hits you, cuts you and all other wrong things and there is nothing you can do about it. Nobody can tell be that is a simulator and you should drive in this respect. You cannot find a place where people drive like AIs in the game drive. I said you cannot do anything for all this disappointment but I have one. I have uninstalled it once and forever.",
