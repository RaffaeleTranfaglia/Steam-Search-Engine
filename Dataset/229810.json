            "review_text": "This is a stylish pixel-graphic top-down shooter with a lot going on in each screen. I found it quite tough to get into at first as if you take one hit you're dead so you can't just run around guns blazing - you have to be a bit more strategic about where you're moving and shooter.  It's designed for multiple players all playing different characters though I played mostly solo. It's also designed for controller support and the controls are different for each charcter which can be tricky if you're usually a mouse &amp; keyboard player.   I wouldn't really recommend it solo but I think it would be a lot of fun with a group of friends using controllers.",

            "review_text": "Before we begin it must be said that I have had close contact with the developer throughout production. He is very open and talkative with his fans and took a lot of my pre-release feedback to heart. As a fan I find this refreshing, but also know that because of this it is my duty to disclose that to anyone reading this review.   Fistful of Gun is a rampaging, fast paced shooter full of over the top art, unhealthy levels of alcoholism and thirteen people who can inexplicably all ride the same horse at the same time. It makes no sense, its story is threadbare and the entire game is unbalanced to the point where a newbie can steamroll skilled players just by using an OP character... and I love every minute of it.   Fistful provides an unparalleled level of co-op support for all kinds of play styles. Every single 'gunslinger' has two methods of control, rebind-able keys and a unique weapon with a series of incomprehensible alternate gun pickups to shake things up. You may choose to play with a controller, mouse, keyboard or keyboard and mouse- you may choose to play single player, co-op, verses, online, offline- through a randomly generated and hectic campaign... Fistful is all about choice. Which is great to me.   The only downsides I could think to add is more down to the theme than anything else. The wild west is great, but it likely doesn't provide many options for enemy variety, or map settings. I personally would have liked more missions taking place in a town or tavern just to shake the game up a bit. They exist in story mode, but are not found in arcade (which I consider to be the meat of the game). Overall though what is presented is very solid and there are often a lot of surprises (such as bears) which you will love to find out (not like bears) and others which you will have less positive feelings for (mothertrucking bears).   Overall Fistful of Gun is a solid arcade shooter with many surprises to be had. The sound and music is great, the art style is unique and hilarious and overall I personally think it is worth your time.",

            "review_text": "    I would like to thank  FarmerGnome  for giving me the chance to try this game and write out a review for them. However, I assure you their action does not affect my evaluation at all.           Environment and Design     – Set on a western world with pixel graphics, the game sure does catches the attention of those who likes either one . There are lot of things going on, literally. Add that to the fact that some characters almost have the same color of the environment, there is no doubt that most of the time you’ll spend more time trying to locate where character has gone into than trying to aim down your enemies. But even so, the developers did a great job on making each level designs, nothing seems to be exactly the same as the next one.        Gameplay     – The game features eleven different playable characters to choose from, which has their own unique ways of controls and attacks. And this makes the game not that repetitive. There are different modes that you can choose from; Arcade, where you advance through the stages once you’ve completely finished off all the enemies; Story, almost similar to the Arcade but in here, you have the will to choose which direction to go to and there is a story behind; Versus, this where you and your friend(s) or stranger(s) can fight to the death; and then there’s Online, you can team up with other people to progress through the game.        Controls     – I think this game balances the use of keyboard &amp; mouse and the controllers. There are characters that are best used with a controller, and there characters that you will probably prefer to be played with your keyboard &amp; mouse.         Conclusion     – Whether you’re a fan of single-player games, multi-player, or co-op games, Fistful of Gun will not fail to keep you satisfied.   ",

            "review_text": "A small fun shooter about killing sheriffs, mexicans, indians and other spaghettiwestern minorities, in both single-player and multi-player (9 players!!). As you can see from the screenshot it's beatifully crafted, the western theme is well represented in both graphic and music (inspired to Morricone), and it's hard to not fall in love with it.  You can choose between 11 characters, everyone with a special perk, a unique weapon and a strange mechanics. They can require a controller/mouse only, though, so better be prepared with both. My favorite is 'The 13th', a freaking entire regiment.  There are actually three different modes: Arcade, Story and versus. On the official FAQ they're explained pretty well, so i'm gonna paste the description here:  Story mode (Single only) - The structure of this mode uses the arcade action gameplay and has a dialog system over it with branching options based on choices, most interactions in story mode are encountering traders, different gangs, assisting with quests, bartering for goods and perks, having tense shootouts, doing some bank robberies, assassinations, pushing wagons full of money through Indian territory, stealth missions and getting really smashed on peyote. There are a few more but that covers the basics of it. The over arching goal is to stop the train baron Boon in his tracks through several boss battles. As all the other modes, this one is built procedurally so sometimes the story may be in a different order to the last play-through.  Arcade mode (Single and Multi) - Smash through waves of enemies and shoot outlaws to reach the highscore board at the end, you will gain skills and perks at the end of each round and occasionally encounter merchants who sell you weapons, offer you bounties or challenge you to a game of cards.  Versus mode (Single and Multi) - Similar base mechanics to previous modes, versus mode would be best described as competitive co-op, where one person holds the Sheriff badge, and only he is the one who gains skills and perks at the end of each round, the catch is other players can shoot the badge from him and kill each other, its a delicate balance between shooting each other and shooting the bandits. The last person standing with the sheriff badge is the winner. everyone else can take a walk.  The games works well, with a steady framerate of 120 fps (GTX 970) and until now i had no connection issues with the multiplayer modes.   Be aware: It's extremely fast paced, hard in single, but extremely fun online.  P.S. Played offline on the laptop too, so hours doesn't count.",

It offers a few varying modes which are listed in the description above. For the competitive players it offers a scoreboard pushing your survival in the Wild West to the limits.  One of the few games I've played where I thought co-op was helpful and not a hindrance. I would definitely recommend this game to fans of arcade shooters and roguelikes.  The only negative I've found is no option to purchase a 2-player Co-Op pack.",

            "review_text": "This looked like it was going to be a fun little game, but I am completely underwhelmed. On a foundational level, A Fistful of Gun actually is a good game. All of the nuts and bolts that go into a solid shmup are present, but the developer decided that a classic formula should be needlessly complicated. There are a ton of characters to choose from, but there's something horribly wrong with all of them: Their movement is slow, their range of attack sucks, or their unique control scheme ranges from overly complex to nigh-unplayable. No matter which of the eleven characters the player chooses, he's hobbled in some crucial fashion. As a result, you have a game that would have been fun, were it not for a hackneyed attempt at balance or novelty (I can't tell which concern was at the forefront, but it scarcely matters since attempts at addressing either were clearly in vain).  That might have been perfectly fine, were this game not challenging enough without the need to handicap the player. You'll be subjected to some rather dense fire as you progress, and the stages are filled with environmental hazards in addition to enemy sprites. There were times when I honestly had no clue what hit, exploded, or in some other fashion killed me. Story Mode is even more difficult. It all adds up to an experience that's more frustrating than it is enjoyable. The player just feels robbed of a good time, having wandered into an unforgiving arena shooter while hamstrung by a character roster that offers a whole lot of nothing. I can tell a lot of good intentions went into this game, but paying $13 for this is a ludicrous proposition.",

To be fair, it is. The selection of characters' different weapons and abilities makes playing each character feel almost like a different game. The levels and enemies also have a great deal of variety that I think would do an excellent job of holding someone's attention, given that they like bullet hell games.  Overall, I did not enjoy this game very much, but would ABSOLUTELY reccomend this to anyone that enjoys bullet hell games!",

The aiming is something you need to learn for yourself. didnt find any kind of tutorial or some hold my hand instructions,  You just get thrown in the game, die a lot, kill a lot, die some more. and then you start figuring out what is what.  In whole, who love hard games and bullet hell in particular, will enjoy it, its not my cup of tea though. its hard, very detailed, have a lot of content to unlock and enjoy with friends...i mean enemies.",

Nothing wrong with that, but I am very certain choosing a Chinese dude is one of the biggest mistakes I have made in the year.  Tao is a lovely dude who likes to play with rockets. His weapon is also rockets, which has a 3 second delay. Seriously, for a game where you and the creeps are running around all over the place, static rocket launchers with a 3 second fire delay is really impossible, especially for a first timer.
