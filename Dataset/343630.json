So here is my thought about it:  This game in development, its very RAW, if any one played Korean MMORPG they will understand how this game feels.  BUT. here come huge but, its FUN. Its hell lot of fun. And its FREE!!!!! Playing for 3 hours i didnt found that micropaymens affect gameplay.  So about the game: -ITS NOT MOBA like Lol, dota or Smite (its only 5 v 5 non stop PVP, NO lanes creeps towers) -there are 13 Heroes , 1 map (some sort of CTF) -Fast paced combat -Skill based mecanics (you need to aim, time your skills, think what to use and when to use) -Proggres is quite fast (atlease for now) -Heroes pretty balance is you know how to counter them. -No items, no Gold, no level-ups in game, pure skill and PVP  Some situation from the game. My friend, Fat dude with the hammer airborn the guy in to the air, and while that guy was falling, i blast him with my hand rail gun. So satisfying.   TL;DR  FUN, FREE, NOT P2W, ACTION BASED ARENA.",

A nice cast of characters, not as many as the screenshots show, but a few nonetheless.  No real pay to win, first time i have ever seen a truly f2p game on steam. (aside from tf2)  The dev posts screenshots that arent even implemented in game yet, so the interface and menus are all really weak.  Its a free game. Download it and try it out, it literally cant hurt you to try.",
