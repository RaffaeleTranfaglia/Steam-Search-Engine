            "review_text": "Really enjoyed this adventure game!! It's different than the average point-and-click adventure game in that the decisions made by the player will change how the story unfolds. Which, in turn, affects your scoring at games end. You play as Mata Hari and are recruited as a spy. As story progresses, you end up becoming a double agent. As with point-and-click adventure games, it is somewhat linear. However ... the key is to strategize. You're a spy. Stop and think. Even though some characters may suggest you go to one country, try going a different route via a different country first. There are side 'missions' that are at play while completing primary missions at hand. With my first playthrough, I pretty much did what I thought I was 'supposed' to do per the character interactions to get what I needed to further the story. My score was pretty sad at games end and I didn't understand why. On my second playthrough, I took more time, chose different routes than suggested by characters, tried to avoid interaction with certain characters until necessary, and was delightfully surprised that I could do much more than I thought. Any adventure gamer will really enjoy this game!!!!  (I would love to see achievements and cards added to this game!!!!)",

            "review_text": "So-so p&amp;c adventure. World famous spy from one hundred years ago mind-♥♥♥♥s and bangs dudes to manipulate them into giving up state secrets. There's way too much emphasis on lame mini-games involving traveling between train stations trying to elude other spies and they even found a way to make her burlesque show boring. Thankfully, they can be skipped if you don't want to rack up points and just play the adventure part. I got it for $5 and took me a little over five hours to beat. This game is geared more toward the casual crowd. It's not horrible if you're desperate for a p&amp;c adventure and you can get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "Like some other reviewers I find it difficult to give this game a pure thumbs up or down. It does have a charm to it--where else can one drug a man to sleep and steal his secrets while dressed in a nightie and high heels? The problem lies not in the story but in the game play. First, there is A LOT of traveling between countires and while the attempt to turn this into a minigame might have meant well it quickly becomes tedious. Second, I thought the the difficulty of the minigames ramped up quickly, espeically the dance one. I know you don't have to be a dancer to finish the game but I hate it when not having great twitch reflexes gets in the way of playing the game how I want to play it--frustration is not equal to fun. Some people are going to love this game but I didn't. The story and the setting simply couldn't overcome what I experienced as poor game play.",
