Have always wanted to play this after countless hours on 2 way back when as a kid and while the games differ slightly still same concept. I was only disappointed by the game feeling more high fantasy over dark fantasy like its sequel but it's still great",

I had to tinker with settings to even get it launching and even looking around the internet for fixes i still cant get it to go 10+ turns (about 10 mins) without crashing. Hearts were broken &lt;/3",
