            "review_text": "Mahjong and pretty girls? Does it fit? In theory it does. As a game-kinda. If you like Mahjong and search for a game to spend some free time on, good desicion. The music is pretty catchy and didn't annoy me a bit even after over 10 hours. The graphics are very pretty and you will love to look at it. The difficulty increases from game to game (so I was about to throw my laptop out of the window, so I will hear the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Mahjong stones shatter on the street, together with my screen, because I had to retry the levels over and over again). BUT there is also an easy mode option for everyone else who doesn't like to throw their pc's from the 10th floor, so the girls finally change their outfits. That's the story about the Mahjong so far. Now we come to the PRETTY GIRLS. Of course, when we buy those games, we expect some skin, don't we? Since the game has a time limit, you don't really get much chance to check out the ladies on the left site. BUT WAIT! What solution do we have for this problem? RIGHT! The dressing room in which we can look at our babes as long as we want. Not all outfits are as revealing as you might hope, so don't expect anything too.. well you know. The drawings are really nice and enjoyable. So, should you buy this game? Oh yes, my friend. You should.",

            "review_text": "'Have we gone too far?' is a question often asked in terms of technological advancement. This also applies in the videogame industry. We've entered an age of VR, an age of hyper realistic graphics, games that tell human stories and feel like they could actually happen. 'Delicious! Pretty Girls Mahjong Solitaire' is step backwards for mankind. Have we gone too far? No. In the case of this game we clearly have light years of improvement ahead.   Delicious! is content on delivering a bare-bones mahjong experience whilst simultaneously delivering bare-bones anime characters. A distinct lack of animation on both aspects of the game, leaves the experience feeling flat. Flat being a word you can't use to describe the outrageously unproportioned girls in the game. Every aspect of this game feels half-baked, a quick money maker while the developer puts their real strength elsewhere.  Is mahjong fun? Yes. But it is mahjong. Nothing more. The extent of extra content only brings a costume image viewing option, where you can zoom and look at the girls in all their outfits. Without any meaningful animation or care in character design, this feels largely superfluous. There is no character development to speak of, no personalities to connect to, so in this regard this girls fall flat yet again.  So have we gone too far? No. But this game makes the advances others have made seem impossibly futuristic. Perhaps one day we will have the realistic softcore mahjong eperience we all desperately need. But for now, this will have to suffice.   6/10",

            "review_text": "So after many hours, I finally beat the entirety of what this game has to offer. However, that number is deceiving because it was primarily spent restarting over and over again, as 99% (yes, actually 99 out of 100) of all puzzles were unsolvable.   After all the time I spent, I noticed a few things that were contributing to it. Besides the non-standard layouts presented that heavily stacked tiles, I noticed that there were several occassions where it didn't appear that there were 4 of a given tile. Perhaps I was mistaken, but it seems like it would lead to a lot of 'No More Pick' results due to impossible overlaps or trapped tiles. And then there is the quaint randomization algorithm that leads to a lot of tiles being near each other most of the time.  Ultimately, the tags of this game are also not really applicable. There is no nudity whatsoever, and this game can hardly be classified as 'casual' with the 'speed game' timer always set. They really needed to pick a genre and stuck with it: either a mobile game type of tile speed matching with its respective combo meter and score, or an entirely different means of scoring that didn't involve a time limit. While the timer wasn't a huge issue, as any time I found myself running out of time, it was on a layout that already wasn't solvable by any means (the final remaining move didn't give access to anything meaningful).   After it all, the rewards were fairly shallow and mediocre. That's not to say they were bad, as I've seen worse in other games, but I suppose I shouldn't expect much for a buck. The character voicing and sound effects were fairly loud and annoying, which became fairly grating after repeating the same rounds over and over again. Not a bad touch I suppose, but it's only cute for a minute or two.",

I quickly learnt to play this game within seconds and I smashed the ♥♥♥♥ out of the first few stages because I found it so entertaining. The Anime girls on the side aren't interesting and I just ignored them as I try-harded the game. This game is extremely fun to play and I'm glad I picked it up. I really meant it when I said I like the game, The anime part isn't what I play this game for I swear.  I will probably never play this game again as I have 33 friends on steam and I don't want to be looked upon as a weaboo. No offense.",

            "review_text": "I suspect that people stay away from this game because of the sexism label that is probably attached to it. Nevertheless, because of my love of this type of 'match two' game I decided I would give it a go.  There are seven girls and between three &amp; five stages per girl each stage has four levels and the idea is that as you successfully progress through the stages the girls clothing gets skimpier.  The bit that interests me the most is the gameplay - no honestly. There is a timer which slowly reduces as you play and there is a combo meter which slows the timer down. (If you get the next pair within a couple of seconds it keeps the combo meter going and pushes it back, as far as I can tell while the combo meter is occupied the timer stalls) But the main reason I like this game is because games of the match Mah Jhong tiles type are normally a walk in the park where you just progress from one level to the next rarely missing. Not with this game (at least not for me) It is so easy to fall in to traps where the next pair you want is covered by it self that it happens frequently except obviously in the first level or two.  Recommended. EDIT-Just thought I'd add, this game cost me £00.75p . You get 6 trading cards all of which dropped within the first two hours and almost all sold for more than £00.10p I think I got around £00.60p from selling them so total cost around £00.15p for a half decent (pun intended) game.",

A few features and an increase in stages (or girls whichever you prefer), which is really great. Wouldn't want to finish this game in about a day.   These praises are for the gameplay, not for the 'plot' this might have. Looking at previous reviews, it seems like Mahjong Solitaire isn't that entertaining of a game, especially if your actual reason is to look at anime girls changing clothes. If you plan on buying this mainly for the Mature and Nudity tag, you should reconsider.   pls add dlc, free or not, of BG for both games. Especially 1st game. Really nice.",
