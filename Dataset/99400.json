            "review_text": "As odd as it may seem, I actually thought I'd really like this game. I don't mind games that are lacking in quality, as long as they provide a good time. Unfortunately, this one soured rather quickly. For those of you out there who were planning on playing this with a controller, it's...extraordinarily hard to get used to. Left stick rolls, right stick/directional pad moves, etc. This was odd, but doable, so I learned it and continued on (though it didn't get easier). I found myself enjoying the level, despite being able to spam one attack that kills the majority of enemies in one hit, taking most of the challenge out of the fighting. The narrator sounds cheesy, Garshasp himself doesn't look human in cutscenes (seriously, look at community screenshots, it's kind of an inside joke), but the environments are nice, and the game sets up what could have been a decent action title.  There are those who like this game, and I definitely see why. I enjoyed it up until the infamous 'wall falling' sequence in level one, where the game teaches you how to slide down a wall with a dagger whilst avoiding patches of wall that will dislodge you. This was fun--until I was instant-killed by a boulder that fell on my head after a 0.02 second window of it appearing on the screen. Obviously, trial-and-error is part of gaming, so I tried again, going different routes and speeding up his falling to avoid the boulder. About 20 tries (no joke) later, I had tried everything (going left, right, center, speeding up, slowing down, avoiding boulders, etc.), and even when I thought I'd passed it, the game instant-killed me despite seeing no boulder on the screen or imperfection in the wall. I'm not sure if it was a glitch, if there was a boulder that just didn't appear on screen, or what it was, but my journey with Garshasp ends here.  This is my first 'not recommended' review, and it comes with regret. I wanted to like this game, and I enjoyed it up until the Invisible Instant-Death. You may very well enjoy this, especially if you have a soft spot for 'bad' games, but be forewarned that many people cannot even get it to work. Check the latest issues in the Community section--some people can't get it to load at all (I couldn't until I messed around with the game's files and launched the application from the .exe file, for example), some people only get a title screen, etc. Also, if you'd like to try it but don't want to pay full price, check the bundle websites. Garshasp shows up in bundles quite a bit, which is where I got my copy.  Check this game out if you want to, but definitely do your research before purchasing.",

            "review_text": "If you're reading this, then you probably already know that the controls in this game are convoluted and imprecise, and that the art style is a bit strange (Garshap, in the cut scenes,  looks half-human, half-lizard man ). You probably also know about the cheestastic writing and voice-overs. None of that bothers me. I can live with it all and, while I'm not familiar with the Persian legend upon which this is based, Garshasp has a Cimmerian feel to it. Being a Conan fan, all of that cheesy goodness works in the game's favor for me.  But, oh man, that camera. That insanely bad camera that goes where it wants, when it wants and, over which, you have zero amount of control. It's actually a bunch of static cameras placed in odd locations without any thought as to how that placement will affect gameplay, and there is no logic to it. This isn't a racing game, and I'm not watching a replay, so why not have it over my shoulder, like any other action game? Why am I sometimes running toward the camera? This isn't Crash Bandicoot 2, and I don't see a polar bear chasing me, so what gives? You're seriously telling me this didn't bother anyone while they were building the game?  But even that isn't a deal breaker for me; I've played plenty of games with poor cameras, and I'm sure I'll play plenty more. No, the deal breaker for me is that the developers don't care about the player. Period. This is evident at the first boss, who crashes through a wall in front of you (one of the few times the camera is actually behind you, where it should be). He  leaves behind a massive hole in the wall, through which you can easily fit.  Yet, after the battle, the game  switches to a top-down view  (presumably hoping you won't notice the GIGANTIC HOLE IN THE WALL) and won't allow you to walk through it. Why? Because the developers have decided they want you to climb the ladder behind you instead.  Nope, sorry. Forget this game; life is far too short. God bless anyone for sticking with it as long as they did. This 'developers vs players' ideal is just poor design, plain and simple. This ill-will could have been avoided by simply having the wall collapse behind the boss when he crashed through it, but apparently it wasn't important. Instead, it's a slap in the face to people who paid for the game, and if the developers are sticking their collective middle finger up at me this early, I'm not sticking around long enough to see how bad it gets later. Not recommended.",

The character models brow is absurd. The combat is not very fluid which is essential for this genre of game. The narrator isn't good either. He reminded me of the Conan movie narration but much much worse. The controls aren't mapped correctly for a 360 controller, but that's a small gribe compared to how bad the combat is. The sounds and music are janky and over the top.   If you like indie or B games because of personality this game doesn't have any. Don't play this even if you get it free like I did.",

The story and gameplay weren't too bad, but I had occasional issues where the controls weren't as responsive as I felt they should be.  The worst part is the camera angles. There are several parts of the game that have platform-like gameplay, and the camera angles often made these sections more difficult than they should be. There's one place where the angle changes by about 90 degrees mid-jump, affecting the direction of the controls. It took several attempts to find that you have to release the controls in order to stick the landing.  Overall, I found the whole experience more frustrating than fun.",

I'm using a controller but there is never any indication on what buttons to press and since this game was only moderately fun to that point, I just decided to quit playing. It's not the worst game I've ever played but I definitely wouldn't recommend anyone buying it when there are so many better games on Steam.",

You would be CRAZY not to get it at the price it's going right now during the summer event!!!

Controls are terrible, camera is terrible, sound is terrible, graphics are terrible (mostly because of bugs that create random untextured walls and holes in the ground), gamelength is very short, gameplay is mediocre at best (like devil may cry, just without effects, combos and badassness, you have a sword though). If you don`t mind spending money on a game with a length of around 2 hours, an uncontrollable beast of a camera, crappy quick time events and an extremely high level of fun which is roughly on par with ♥♥♥♥ing minesweeper without mines, then go ahead and give this game a shot - surprisingly enough, it is still better than Garshasp 2 after all.",

Garshasp was so badass that he leaped at a horse in the middle of the night as a kid (this is totally in game) and replaced all his blood with HORSE TESTOSTERONE. He's literally the incarnate of anger. If you deny Garshasp anything, he'll ♥♥♥♥ing come to your door, impale himself on his own sword, and kill all of your goats and nearby farm animals while complaining about being too ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off to even care about the testosterone leaking out of his chest cavity. He'd probably wish for another pair of arms and a second heart just so he can pummel more of your goats into the Earth before he bleeds out, and impale himself one more time just to get the ♥♥♥♥ out of him.
