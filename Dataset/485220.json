            "review_text": "  Not really a bad game. Also, not really that difficult. It is just annoying sometimes.  A huge problem is that, for some reason, my save file from a time ago simply crashed the game and I had to begin everything again. Yet, the second time that I played it, I finished those same levels really quick again.  The level 10 is pretty annoying, but, overall, you have to be patient.  But, still, the game is not good... the decision to make everything dark is not good (but you can change this option); What you can't change, though, and makes the game a lot more enfuriating, specially in level 10, is the friction that your ball has with the walls.  Sometimes you'll want to pass through some part of the level very close to a wall, but the friction will simply almost break the game, by the amount of lag. That is the part that definitely makes me see that this game is not really that polished yet (and they may actually change it, but, it is still not enjoyable).   I got this game for free, in some giveaway. and I could recommend it if you could get for a really cheap price. Only then I would, maybe, recommend it, but I would assure you that you'll probably won't find that much enjoyment in this game, but, at least, it is pretty short, and you can finish it pretty quick, if you want to have another game for achievements.",
