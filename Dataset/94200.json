It features all the intensity, depth, and lovingly handcrafted pixels of a classic arcade shooter, with a modern twist: deeply-integrated cooperative gameplay.",

            "review_text": "Jamestown is an extremely solid shmup, with one really fantastic advantage over other shmups.  As a single player game, it doesn't match the classics it takes inspiration from. The bullet patterns and level designs are solid but also a bit bland and lacking in strategic variety. It's good, but not great.  Where it really shines is multiplayer, as unlike the tacked on co op of your average Cave game, Jamestown's mechanics and gameplay were finely balanced around co op from the start. It's probably the best co op shmup ever made, and that's definitely something to brag about.  It also has one of the best and most creative settings and aesthetics for a shmup outside of a Cave game. The theme, music, pixel art, and setting are excellent.  If you don't have anyone to play with (local multiplayer only), than Jamestown is a decent shmup that should probably be somewhere in the middle of your wishlist compared to some of the other excellent PC shmups out there. However, if you have some friends to play with, it's an absolute must buy.",

            "review_text": "  Disclosure: I marked “received this product for free” because I received it as a gift.  Jamestown: Legend Of The Lost Colony is a game that I wanted to play at one time. Before I make a purchase I typically check out reviews (both good and bad) and the Steam Discussions to see if there is anything that might make me think twice about buying. If the game crashes on start or has some sort of other technical issue there is a good chance someone will be posting about it. In the case of Jamestown, one doesn't have to look far to find some dirt.  When I looked through the discussions I learned that Final Form Games appear to have completely abandoned the PC version of the game (it looks like they stopped support to focus on PlayStation 4's Jamestown+). The developers haven't posted since June 24, 2015. There is at least one somewhat major bug that they're aware of and haven't fixed as of today August 28, 2016. For many users, every enemy projectile in the game is currently a dull grey color. The color of bullets in shooting games is kind of a big deal and there is a good reason why they often are colored brightly. How are you supposed to dodge them if you can't see them clearly? I've played quite a few shoot 'em ups and this was enough to convince me not to buy the game.   A fix exists, but it doesn't work for all users. It involves reverting to a previous version through the properties menu of the game in Steam. It ended up partially working for me. It fixed the colors but the game became unplayable unless played windowed. I strongly prefer fullscreen so decided to keep the grey bullets. Aside from not being aesthetically pleasing, there were only a few parts where I found them to be particularly detrimental. I also experienced odd controller bugs if I was holding a direction immediately while spawning. I'm not sure if it was my gamepad or not, but it wasn't difficult to avoid once I realized what was causing it.  Jamestown isn't really a standard arcade style shooting game. Rather than being one continuous run, the game is split up into five stages. In order to unlock all five stages the player is required to beat the earlier stages on progressively higher difficulty levels. The later stages do not feature lower difficulty options at all. This serves as a nice and slow introduction for individuals inexperienced with the genre. In addition to the regular stages there are challenge levels that feature special objectives such as flying through rings, getting a certain score within a time limit, or surviving a brief onslaught. The regular stages are enjoyable but I had even more fun with the challenges. The only campaign stage I didn't like was the final one which unexpectedly introduces environmental hazards which aren't in the earlier levels and felt out of place.  After completing a stage you are rewarded with ducats that can be used in the store. Among other things the store sells alternate ships, additional challenges, and the gauntlet mode. Each ship has a primary attack, a special secondary attack, and the ability to vaunt. Activating vaunt mode provides temporary invincibility, a damage bonus, and a score multiplier. Picking up coins prolongs the amount of time your retain the bonuses. The Gauntlet serves as the game's version of an arcade mode where you play through all the stages consecutively with limited continues. It is also worth mentioning that the game allows up to four players. I never tested multiplayer out myself so I can't say how well it works.  Although it's a little unorthodox when compared to classic Japanese arcade shooters, Jamestown is one of the strongest entries into the shoot 'em up genre from a western developer that I've ever played. It's truly sad that Final Form Games has let it fall into its current state. The game is gorgeous, the soundtrack is great, and the overall presentation is outstanding. Due to the solid package and enjoyable gameplay I'd recommend this game, but with a warning about the likelihood of encountering bugs. There is a lot of fun to be had here and it's playable even with the grey bullets, but I think it's important that potential buyers know that there are bugs that may never be fixed.

The controls work about equally well with mouse, keyboard or a gamepad and there are several difficulty levels, although like most bullethell games it leans towards being hard. The graphics are well made with detailed backgrounds, the soundtrack is excellent and there are several mini challenges as well as a funny dialogue option which give variety to the core game. Its weaknesses would be its small level variety as well as the lack of online co-op. I do recommend nevertheless, especially for local co-op purposes, where you will get the most out of it.",

            "review_text": "Jamestown is a shoot'em up (shmup) that pleased me greatly. The game's story is set in a fictitious alternative past in the XVII century, where the planet Mars is a British colony that is at war with Spanish forces allied with the native Martians. Some real historical characters of the period even are mentioned in the game as the famous John Smith. Jamestown has a very good vertical gameplay, being that the game has four types of ships, each ship has a normal shot and another special. There is also the 'Vaunt Mode' that can be activated when the gold bar is full. The 'Vaunt Mode' when activated generates a temporary shield around the ship and also allows double the damage and also the points earned while active. The 2D graphics of this game are well done and the controls work well, but the highest point of the game is the soundtrack ... it's superb! Especially the tracks of Chapters 1, 3 and 5 that are simply wonderful! Jamestown: The Legend of Lost Colony captivated me and was quite enjoyable for me to finish it.

The aim is to survive every level by dodging all of the projectiles that the enemy fires towards you and to simply survive 'til the end, where there'll be a boss awaiting for you to defeat.   There's a good variety of ships to use that all have different tactics and methods of progressing the stages and they're all entertaining to use.   The DLC is well worth it, too. So don't hesitate to pick it up - it'll give you some brand new ships to add to your arsenal. A great game, well worth your time.  All in all, i'm giving it an 8/10.",

Each level can be played through in under 5 minutes. True there are only 5 levels in the core game, but I keep revisiting them time and time again. The addition of multiplayer and score rankings only adds to the fun. Besides the 5 main levels there are challenge levels and lots of unlockables to unlock.

Ironically, I ended up playing Closure for all of 20 minutes, and I've invested nearly 10 hours into this one. I rarely even play shooters, and yet this game is thoroughly addicting and enjoyable. What I like most is the simplicity. It takes 5 minutes to learn everything there is to know about how to play, and you can jump right in on the lowest difficulty and have some fun without getting crushed right away. The difficulty scales very well, and each stage requires you to beat all the previous stages on a higher difficulty level than the one before to unlock the next stage. It's a natural progression, and is suitable even for someone like myself who isn't a veteran to these types of games.  That being said, there are only five stages in the game which are each very short, but they are well designed and have high replay value. On top of that there are five challenge packs that you can purchase using in game currency, which range from challenging to rage inducing. But what really makes this game most enjoyable are the beautiful 16-bit sprites and the art direction. A high level of detail was put into each stage, and some of the backgrounds are gorgeous. It's only too bad you don't have much time to look at them as you're constantly dodging bullets. It's got that classic old school look but at the same time has an aesthetic all its own. Plus the explosions look great, and I love how you collect gold from each enemy you destroy. Each time you blow up a ship and those chunks of gold pieces come falling down the screen, it's a real treat and feels so rewarding. Oh, and the soundtrack is awesome too. All in all, if you're a fan of schmup games, this is a must buy. I paid practically nothing for it, but can say it's easily worth 10 bucks. And if you can get it on sale ($4.99 when I wrote this) then it's a no brainer.",

You face the forces of the Martian/Spanish alliance in hopes of being pardoned for a crime against the English crown. The orchestral soundtrack and story scenes somehow make this seem more epic than you expect, even if it is a bit silly. And the entire package feels polished and well made.

You can play locally with up to four players, using mouse, keyboard, or gamepads. I hadn't played a good local multiplayer game in a while, and this was a blast with three. There are four different ship types, so people can take on multiple roles in a group. Best to stick with the easiest type if you're going solo, though.

Jamestown quenches all of these thirsts along with an unexpectedly stunning soundtrack to create a wonderful shooter for both the novice and the masochistic.  This top-down arcade sci-fi shmup is all about style. Difficulties can be chosen before each stage, ranging from the easiest resembling 1942 to Insane which will challenge any fan of the Touhou series. (If you don't know touhou, find it on youtube and it will make your eyes bleed. In a good way.)  Multiple ships (with more available via DLC!), a wide array of difficulties, and an in-game unlockables via gold gained for blowing things up and creating long bonus string allow for many return plays, for both quick breaks or marathon sessions.  One downside - The 4-player Coop is SINGLE MACHINE ONLY. There is no online option. It's great for having a few people together, but in this day and age, not having online multiplayer can really limit popularity of a title. But... THAT'S IT! Everything else is a big thumbs up.  It's even got an unlockable 'parody' mode. Doesn't change much, but it really adds a lovely transparency to the developers' love of oldschool shooters.  This is a shining example of what the indie game scene can do. Do yourself a favor and pick this beast up.",

However this game brings out a lot of interesting mechanics I've never seen from the few titles I've played from the genre. You get different ship models each with an interesting superpower which just further engages you without getting to ridiculous missile spam.  Now the bad. The levels are short and you quickly get through half the story in about 20 mins. But then it orders you to play all three previous levels again in high difficulty in order to go through.

Jamestown is one of those kinds of games that can get relentlessly difficult, yet give you warm ups to give you the practise needed for the higher difficulties as well as the challenges.  On Normal, the story missions aren't really difficult, but you can only play through the first three missions as each one after the third requires you to beat all unlocked missions on a higher difficulty, and it's through this that you develop the skills needed to complete this game. There are only six missions, but the requirements give each level a fair degree of difficulty to finish the main game.  There are also challenges and a Gauntlet Mode (which sends you through the story mode up to the levels given with the difficult you're on in one straight run. No lives or Credits restored. 2 Continues and 2 lives per continue will be all you get!) which will give you more to do after you finish the game. Not gonna lie, I haven't made much progress with those challenges yet, but completing each one is very rewarding considering how insane some of them are.  The ships themselves differ and cater to various play styles, including the DLC ships. I find myself using the Beam (the default ship) often, but I find the Ghost is a lot of fun, and a neat shout out to Guwange (another bullet hell style game where you control your main character and a spirit, basically how this ship operates).  The music, the style, the gameplay, it's all well done and none of it seems out of place or jarring. The story is a neat throwback to the days of crazy, out there stories, and it's great fun with friends if you can get everything set up to allow them to play, being a local co-op game rather than an online one.

I had to go to my program files to access the executable to change the settings, just so I can play the game through steam again. Also, the third mouse button uses your shield ability in game but for some reason it will not work for me, and it's pretty important for the last level. The biggest issue is that the developers are basically gone. No updates from them on their website or twitter in about a year.

It's sucked me in for hours and hours, even though technically the 5 levels in the game are beatable in about 5-10 mins each.  I find some bullet hell games are frustratingly hard, but Jamestown remains fun even on the highest difficulties. Every map has unique enemies and a unique boss, and every difficulty adds more bullets to the fray. It's fun replaying maps with different ships, both to challenge myself and to see how differently each one fares.  It's well coded - it has never crashed on me, and works perfectly with screen recording like FRAPS. Unlike flash based games, there are no odd collision or input issues.

It’s time to play a game full of bullets and explosions, where only your reflexes will decide if you win or lose in Jamestown.  The year is 1619. England and Spain are at war, and the conflict has spilled over into the New World. Only we’re not in America. We’re on Mars! Join the colonists of Jamestown as they fight back against the Spanish Conquistadors, search for the lost colony of Roanoke, and more. This top-down bullet hell arcade shooter is everything awesome about video games.  Play through the storyline with four different ships, each with their own playstyle. There is four player splitscreen co-op. The action is tight, fast-paced, frantic, but fair. At times the screen will be positively filled with bullets, and your only hope will be to deploy the Vaunt, a temporary shield that makes you invulnerable and gives you a damage and points boost. Knowing when to deploy it, and when to gamble if you can make it through an attack is a huge factor in your success. Because you only get 2 credits before the level is over. Then its back to square one.  The graphics are charming, full of beautiful depth and vibrant color. Enemies are unique and interesting, backgrounds are lovingly detailed. The art in Jamestown is among the best I’ve seen in an arcade style video game. The music and sound effects are equally top notch. Especially the final level and boss fight, which get my blood pumping and adrenaline racing.  Final Form Games really set the bar high with this game. There’s very little I could nitpick that is wrong with it. I would love to see this in a real arcade machine, with an actual joystick and buttons. This game is screaming to eat people’s quarters. It excels at letting you think you’re just one run away from beating the level, every time you fail. Just one more try…  The story of the early American English colonies is a fascinating tale of survival and hardiness. Throw in Martians, steampunk flying machines and beautiful pixel graphics, and you have a winner of a shooting game. If you call yourself a gamer, get this and play it. It is excellent.",

The rudimentary gameplay is not interesting or challenging enough to sustain prolonged interest, the enemy types are forgettable, the stages are bland and mono-paced, and the same song plays for every level, minus the last--an unforgiveable sin, to my mind, in this genre where ZUN and so many others have set such a precedent and high standard of quality for soundtrack composition. Everyone says this soundtrack is great, and i disagree--it is orchestral, emotionaless, unintuitive, and not at all designed around the experience of FLYING A SHIP SHOOTING STUFF. At the end of the day, Jamestown feels like an experience not designed around itself--the fluff is what makes the gameplay, but the fluff is stupid (no, it's /really/ stupid), and i don't like it and you can't make me like it, and therefore the game doesn't hold much weight by itself. The 'Vaunt' system is kind of cool, but ZUN's done better in every Touhou from 8 onward, so that's not much to brag about.  Anyway. If you think there's a chance you'd enjoy a mediocre shooting experience with an impersonal movie soundtrack and terrible writing, buy Jamestown. i feel i was tricked. this review is brutally honest. i apologize for anyone's feelings that it hurts.",
