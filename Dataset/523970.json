    "description": "&quot;That game where you can pee, poop and puke.&quot; -- this is a 2D platformer with 360Â° aiming. It is violent, it is fast, it is absolutely over the top. Jump around, slide, dash and dunk into enemies to kill them, and then eat them. On your quest for meat you encounter a lot of deadly traps in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.",
