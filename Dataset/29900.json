            "review_text": "Interesting concept, but flawed game. It's not that is bad or anything. It's fun, but it could have been so much more than it is. The things that made this game 'fail': 1-It tried to fit itself within the fads of it's time (AKA feel like a Gears of War knock-off) rather than try to have it's own thing. 2-The upgrade and weapon marketing system it's just there to make you look for bonus items and money, making the campaign a bit longer (hint: play the game only using the single handed guns, it plays waaay better) 3-Fighting the soldiers is more interesting than fighting the mutants, but in most of the time, you fight the mutants. 4-The campaing was too short (especially if you ignore the bonus hunting). 5-The story is a mess of events and characthers that you don't see most of it. Who is Yago, what's the beef with Nadia, what I did in the past that was so horrible and haunts me to this day? none of these are answered. But, I still recommend it: tons o' fun, each single handed weapon (the pistol, the sub-machinegun, the revolver and the sawed-off shotgun) complety changes the way you aproach a level, and at many times, you'll feel like a boss when completing a mission. In short: this game coulda been awesome, but it's just... good.",

            "review_text": "Tenno't of Ten!  Just kidding. It wasn't perfect, but it was very unjoyable.   The Positives: The story is nice, the gameplay was interesting, the sound design was pretty good, and the way your character developes was handled well. On top of that, several of the enemy types were interesting cosmetically.  The Meh: The controls were a little wonky, but not bad. There were some glitches and oddities, but nothing game-breaking.  The Negatives: Sense of direction wasn't always clear, I got lost at times. Also, the gunplay wasn't very reliable. I usually had to rely on the Glaive (melee/thrown weapon you get early on), and only found the semi-auto weapons to be good with ammo conservation. Also, the boss fights were kind of weak because all you have to do is repeat a few steps to kill them.  Final thoughts: It's worth playing through. It's fun once you get used to the controls, and is great if you're interested into where the Tenno (from Warframe) began. That being said, I'm amazed that very few things from this game made it over into Warframe! There are several things that I wish would be added to Warframe from Dark Sector in a future update!  Rating: 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "If you want more lore behind Warframe and to see what the world was like before it, play this.  The good; it's a very beautiful game overall, the style is great and for the age of the game, it is rather beautiful. The environment is great and lively overall; some of your enemies seem outright ready to ♥♥♥♥ themselves when you approach. It supplies some very tense moments that, even though you are the first Tenno (Warframe players know that this means a beast of a person that can take out hordes of enemies...), for at least the beginning of the game - You will feel like the small fish in the pond next to some of the enemies. It's a fun challenge that set me often muttering 'No no... Don't tell me I have to fight that.. I ain't ready for it.' Just look around for items that will help you. It's not always well shown. There are some problem solving elements you need to work out as well, but as noted in the bad, it's not always well directed that you're supposed to do things, you have to figure it out on your own.  The bad; it is a port from the Xbox 360 and the controls reflect this, lacking a lot of tuning that the PC release needed - Prepare for sloppy controls that take a lot to get the hang of. It seems to be missing a minimap feature or any sort of guidance at all... Though some classic gamers may feel this is how things used to be, but I spent thirty minutes sculking around a dead end only to discover I was supposed to figure out I had to something for another five on a hunch that 'this may be it...'. The mod system is interesting but like many - You can't remove the mods. There is no explaination toward it and to be fair some mods would be great to allocate elsewhere after learning this early in the game.  In all, worth a play at least if you can get around the controls and don't mind figuring out exactly what you need to do on your own.",

It's not made for PC, as others have pointed out. and Expect a lot of gunmetal gray. when shot, you will shake more than a crying baby in Johnny Cash' arms. you can pick up enemy weapons, but they will explode after a while.. and yes, I understand that it's a mechanic explained in the lore... but that doesnt make it any less of a stupid mechanic..  If you want to support Digital Extremes by buying a previous game rather than Platinum in Warframe, go nuts.. I don't regret giving DE money for this game because I think they're great.  but if you're here hoping for an amazing story (subpar) and awesome combat mechanics.. then keep looking, you get a glaive (throwing blade) later on and yes, chucking that thing at necks is fun... but thats literally the only fun part of the combat",

            "review_text": "It's okay. Pick it up in a bundle or at 90% off.  Pros: - Looks pretty nice - Has some fun spots  Cons: - No cover system. In a shooter. Oh the enemies can take cover, just not you. You can't even crouch. - You don't really need a cover system anyway, because enemies are dumb as bricks. - You have to manually fix the widescreen resolution in the config file or the game warps it. I'm pretty sure widescreen monitors existed in 2009. - Everything is bulletproof. Just stand behind a tent if you're getting shot at. - The powers suck for the most part, and the game forces you to use them by taking away most of your guns. The pistol you get to keep is still better than the powers. The best thing about the powers is picking up dead enemies' guns so you don't have to use the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ powers anymore. - The story suffers from the eight deadly words of writing: I don't care what happens to these people. - You have no context for anything, and the protagonist is a whiner. See the eight deadly words above.  And yet I still somehow recommend it. There is fun to be had - just don't pay full price for it.",

The more of a 'monster' you become, the more 'human' you become (well, despite all the brutality he must partake in to survive). Tenno also gets to use an awesome pinwheel of death that grows out of his hand, blatantly ripped off of the cult 80's sci-fi/fantasy film 'Krull', name and all (the 'Glaive'). Graphics are great, soundtrack is a bit repetitive but great, Tenno's powers become more awesome as you progress, and the whole affair serves as a prequel of sorts to 'Warframe' (I played Dark Sector first, way back in 2007 on my Xbox 360, so I was drooling over Warframe when it first came out on PC). What's not to like? Er, other than the aspect ratio being a little screwy on widescreen resolutions.",

            "review_text": "Quick review of this underrated game.    Presentation:  This game presents itself to you as a dark Alternate Reality Earth. It does it well with the whole mutants running about, Hayden becoming a super human freak of nature, and the russian backround.   Concept:  Simple, Hayden the main protagonist is a merc that goes to russia to get a job done, he gets it done, shoots down a helicopter, runs into a mad scientist, gets shanked by a walking scrap of metal, gets infected, he tries to avoid transforming because it turns other people into horrible mutants, but eventually our protagonist: Hayden, instead of avoiding the transformation, he willing accepts it because the powers he slowly gains through out the game makes him very powerful, we are talking x-men levels here only much more violent.   Gameplay:  Third Person 'Action' shooter more like, it has a resident evil thing going on but it has a lot more focus on action combat gameplay compared to other third person shooter games. His main weapon isn't a gun which is why it is hard to classify this game as a third person shooter. His main weapon of choice is the Glaive, a very unique weapon type that i've only ever seen one action/hack n' slash character use, and that would be Van Helsing.  To make this quick, it is fun plain and simple. You can throw the Glaive as a projectile type weapon like a very violent boomrang, or get up close and personal by slashing people up. The finisher moves in this game are also awesome, It is a bit violent for my taste but cant deny it is very stylish looking well animated finisher moves.   Graphics:  Nice for a budget game. Which I assume this game is.   Sound:  Nice sound effects for the Glaive, it sounds very blade-ish, the SFX used sounds extremely brutal when hack 'n and slashin away at legions of mutant freaks and generic soldiers.  The music gets pretty frigg'n scary though, the music is scarier than the actual game itself.  Haydens voice acting is great, budget game or not whoever his voice actor is did a great job. Everyone else is pretty junk though.   Story:  Badass (albeit normal human) merc for a Main Protagonist: Hayden, turns into a super human freak of nature, gains super powers such as creating shields made of pure energy to reflect projectiles, slowly gains metalic like armor, can absorb three elemental powers with his Glaive and use them against his foes ~ Lightning, Fire and Ice.   I also like his character design, it isn't often modern game designers that aren't japanese, chinese or south korean that make male characters actually look cool looking with a modest slim build and a cool hair cut, the hulking tall grunts from games like gears of war or god of war are very common and I don't like those types of designs for male characters.   Entertainment:  Game is entertaining overall. It is a welcome twist on the third person shooter genre, throwing in super powers, a likable male protagonist with a cool character design, good voice acting, fun gameplay. Yeah, pretty gewd stuff.   Replay Value:  Fair, only because to play with the Glaive weapon. Not many games have a Glaive class for fighting styles, it is a unique style of gameplay, too bad this version is extremely violent for the most part. Still fun though.   Conclusion:  Fun game, if the price is below $5 on steam sale or if you can find a retail steam code cheaper, go for it, it is worth it just for the unique gameplay when you are tired of shooting crap all day, get up close and start slashing away.   THE GOOD  *Likable main male protagonist, Hayden is a badass. *Glaive is a badass unique weapon, a fighting style not used often. *Decent graphics for a budget game, character models are good. *Decent Storyline, better than most budget games. *Finshing moves look very stylish and flashy, well animated and violent.   THE BAD  *No option to turn off blood and gore. (I don't like blood or gore in games, i prefer style and fantasy.) *Buggy cover system *Linear gameplay, no exploration or any extra discovery.   Score:   7.5/10 ~ recommended | Note: Only if you can purchase the game under $5, if not don't bother.",
