One team has a Ginormous Landshark Japanese Thingy that destroys most on its path. Other players on this team are armed with simple pistols and healing beams that activate automatically when 'near' the GLJT. The other team on the other hand has military units that can pound rockets and even what seemed like a mother of all bombs slow targetting ordinance. Both sides die frequently and must respawn and race back towards the location of GLJT either to kill it or heal it. Usually GLJT will die or reach the objective and destroy it.  CRAZY fun! Invite your steam friends to join you for even greater lolz. The only way this game is ever going not to get a recommend is if the community abandons it and it dies. So spread the word!   ",

            "review_text": "If only more people played this. With one incredibly detailed map, dotted with multiple vehicles ( the space bomber/ fighter jet/thing being my favourite) and jokes, this game never ceases to be ridiculous. It's not without problems however. As I said there is only one map that is one mile squared in area, which isn't really enough for a MOBA. Movement is also very restricted as the Omegalodon which makes it hard to hit ground enemies before they run away.  Overall, if your willing to overlook the small mapsize and you don't play as the Beast from the deep too often, you will have a whale of a time with this game. ",

Let me just keep this short and sweet, The game itself is extremely fun but the only downside was the extremely small amount of servers available, While it did peak at 6 servers the problem was the servers took an extremely long time to connect you and that really let me down. Back when this game was at it's peak of players there were 50+ Servers online at a time now it seems the game has really died off, I did enjoy my time playing this game but unfornutely it isn't worth a Recommend as it was extremely easy to kill the big Shark and win the game for the Police/Military. If you were playing as Omegaladon you'd need atleast 3 Enviros right up your trumpet just for you to survive, That and it takes 13+ Minutes to get to the Objective as the Shark. I feel i was robbed of the $10 i used to purchase the game as it just wasn't as enjoyable of most games like it.  2/10",

To put it simply, If you're decent enough with the Helicopter, You're not gonna die as Soldier/Police unless you make a silly mistake, making it rather unfair on Omegalodon (also, a lot of servers just seem to become a DeathMatch when No one wants to play as Omegalodon)",

First of all the community is dead (buy the game to fix this), which makes it hard to play, and the sky limit is too low, meaning it is hard to fly well.
