            "review_text": "Pretty solid TD game with a twist—you can build towers AND summon forth your own units to travel the lanes and butcher enemies/buildings!  Multiple 'heroes' can be recruited across the story and they each cone with their own unique spell and unit(s). From the Spider Queen that can call forth cheap, fast spiders to the Blood Mage who can make dead bodies explode, there is a good variety of towers, units and spells.  Super tongue in cheek story is actually kinda fun and upbeat— it helps keep you going from level to level to see what ridiculous events will unfold next! EDIT: I feel the need to edit and say that the story certainly takes a twist for the more somber and 'Daaamn...' feeling towards the end!",
