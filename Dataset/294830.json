If you buy it ust be warned its buggy as %$$% but that doesn't mean you cant have fun. Its literaly not for everyone. Seriously it's not.

When you get past the crashes and release bugs it's a really fun game to play. It's not that big or hardcore but it somewhat realistic and fun to play. The variety of vehicles and things to do makes the game enjoyable for quite a while. If you ever get bored you can always go on a rampage and crash into everything. The devs will soon fix the crashes and the bugs and add more updates so it will only get better from this point on. If the game is on sale I would say buy it before it goes off sale as almost anyone would enjoy this. (But not hardcore COD fans who play FPS games all day)",

            "review_text": "Well, I have learned another lesson about buying games on the first day of release....Don't do it. This game is broken and crashes without making it to the main menu.  Edit: Due to negative comments, I must add that I am not the bad guy here. This game was NOT in early access. But I expected some flaws, as these simulator games are hit or miss on the quality. I purchased a finished game, I can't wait until its finished so I can write a proper review of my gameplay experience.  Unfotunately for now, I cannot recommed anyone purchase this because I am not the only one having problems with the game crashing. When it is patched so I can play a few hours, I will edit my review.  Edit 9/12/2014 The patch came out 8 days after release so here is my review- It's about what I expected when I purchased this title. Good graphics, probably the best feature of the game. There still are some bugs that need to be worked out. I am satisfied with the game for the price but you have to like simulator games. I am not changing the thumbs down because, at the time I purchased, there were no reviews. I posted this review because I use the review system to help me decide if I should purchase the game, and for all the other gamers that do the same, I was providing valuable information to help them as they have helped me.  Edit 9/12/2014 The patch was out yesterday and now the game will play. However, there are still game-breaking bugs and crashes.About 10 hours in, and this will be the 3rd time I have had to restart because of crashing during loading a saved game or a bug with the truck being empty but when I try to dump a container in it, it says the truck is full.  Buy at your own risk.",

This should not be listed as a simulation game because there is no simulation, not to mention the graphics sucks. I am a garbage man in NY and if i moved that slow i would fired so quick. You can't control the garbage man only the driver which sucks. No first person cam no moving the cam around just that horrible view. I did not have any problems with the game loading or working or anything it works perfectly fine for me just sucks. Horrid game do not buy!",

However this game could be better but is poorly developed, poorly tested for bugs, repetive bin colours, false computer specs, manual is very light, bad release.  I can't belive this game got the green light. I wish steam had a better game quality control, becase these german developers/publishers are getting away with it by publishing shity quality of games.
