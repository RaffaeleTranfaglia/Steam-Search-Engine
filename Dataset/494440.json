This is just a warning to people like me who think ' Cool, good graphics, great music, awesome reviews. This must me a real cool otome game!' Guys always read more about what you purchase, I mean it may just be me who is not into the whole in depth reads about 'AHEM' what touched what, what went where, what was brushed, you know things that are usually marked as mature? It could be just me but I was expecting a cute scene from 'Hajime' but it was not cute and I stoped reading by the power of God I was not scarred but did feel the need to clense my self and pray for a while lol. But really NOW I know always get more infor on what you get thank God steam allows refunds before a certian amount of time. Look I may be seen as a normal 15 turning 16 tear old but on the inside I still don't like that stuff. To me it's just a 'Oh my goodness' factor and the whole time I was ready for it to end until I just could not take it and deleted it, got a refund and am trying to for get it all~. . . . . ANYHOW this game is not for the ' Aw at the end they kissed and are now boyfriend and girlfriend! ' otome game players unless by kissing you me bed room stuff, it's not cute nor is it my thing, though it's a good game just not my taste I'm not really into smut type stuff. But hey if you like all power to you for finding something to make you smile everyone needs something like that. But still, to me it's kinds just T.M.I mate T.M.I lol.",
