            "review_text": "The first Hexcells game is basically the tutorial to Hexcells Plus. If you thought the first game was too easy (and let's face it, that surely includes everyone) then this is the real game right here. The first Hexcells only gets interesting in the last few levels; well, Hexcells Plus starts off from that point, so it's logically a much better game. The concept is simple: find which cells are occupied and which are empty using surrounding clues that tell you how many occupied cells are in a row, how many occupied cells are adjacent to each occupied cell, and how many occupied cells are found within a certain radius of an occupied cell. It looks like Minesweeper at first glance, but it's far more interesting than that. Some of the later levels here get pretty tough, and there are times when you find it difficult to believe that it's possible without guessing, but then suddenly you'll spot a line of reasoning that you've missed and a few more pieces of the puzzle fall into place. It's highly addictive, and not to be played at 2am when you're half-asleep. Great puzzle game, recommended, but if you're new to the series then start with the first one.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoyed the first Hexcells, but my main complaint is that it was far too short. While Plus technically has the same exact number of puzzles, it will last you a whole lot longer--there are new mechanics that make the game far, far more challenging than the first. The same basic gameplay is still here: it's kind of a mashup of Minesweeper and Picross, and it's incredibly satisfying to logically work out all the solutions.   If you played the first game,  there's two new types of tiles. Black hexes can have a question mark on them; they serve to severely limit the paths one can take to fully solve the board. These end up being an effective way to resolve the primary issue with the game's structure, in that it is otherwise far, far too easy to finish puzzles. The second new mechanic is blue tiles with numbers--the number represents how many blue hexes are present within a two-tile radius. They're great additions; I found them to be a pretty clever way to expand the basic structure of the game.  It's absolutely wonderful to have a sequel that provides more of what I enjoyed while also resolving every issue I had with the initial entry in the series. The first Hexcells honestly just feels like a prototype after playing Plus; I'd still recommend it, but there's no reason whatsoever to play it if you've skipped to Plus. Either way, though, Hexcells Plus is a must buy for anyone who enjoys puzzle games.",

As such, my earlier review comments '  here  ' still hold true. Where I feel  Hexcells Plus  differs is in the difficulty. I found most puzzles relatively easy in the original, but in Plus there were a number that kept me scratching my head. These took me approximately 20% longer to get through; I certainly enjoyed the increased challenge.  Your deduction &amp; logic skills will need to be sharp to get a perfect run on some of these levels! Well worth playing .. would flex my brain muscles HARDER again! Great puzzle game!

Length:  8-10 hours  Score:  6.5/10   Full Review:  If you played the first Hexcells game, then you’ll already be familiar with the basic premise, and most of Hexcells plus mechanics, so I won’t go over them again. If you haven’t played the first Hexcells, then you should either play that before playing Hexcells Plus, or just play Hexcells Inifinte (the last part of this review will cover that more).  What I will go over is what’s new and different to Hexcells Plus compared to the first game in the series. The short answer: not much. Hexcells Plus is basically the next series of levels after the final ones in the first Hexcells game. It does re-introduce the mechanics found in the first game, but its difficulty has a sharper spike, and it’s (thankfully) quite a bit more difficult to complete. It only has 10 more levels than the first game (making a total of 36 in Plus), it takes quite a bit longer to complete than the first did, Plus in more in the range of 8-10 hours, as opposed to the scant 2 of the first  Now, what’s new about Plus? Well, it introduces two new types of cells to the game. Vacant cells that have a question mark instead of a number in them, simply not indicating how many adjacent cells contain hexes. The other type is a blue hex that contains a number, indicating how many blue hexes are within a 2 cell radius. These two mechanics add a lot more difficulty to the game, and overall make it more enjoyable.  That added difficulty spike is also why my two criticisms from the first game are even more noteworthy than before. Those being: 1). An option to save your progress mid-stage to resume later, something I once again get around by taking a screenshot to glance at when re-doing my progress if I need to stop playing before I can complete a stage. 2). A way to test out potential solutions without actually applying them yet (essentially like Picross’ overlay feature). This would be far more useful here than in the first game given the more complicated puzzles, and needing to look at how all the different numbers indicating hexes interact with each so that you can determine which cells have hexes and which do not.  None-the-less, Hexcells Plus is still a fun puzzle game. If you’ve already played the first game, then this one serves as a fine continuation to it, offering what is essentially a hard mode. If you’ve not played any Hexcells games, then either pick up the complete pack when it’s on sale for under $3, or get just the third and final game Hexcells Infinite, as it offers a level generator, so it offers more gameplay, if you only want one.",

            "review_text": "First of all, if you're considering getting this before playing regular Hexcells - don't. Hexcells Plus is far more difficult than the original and for me, that sapped some of the fun out of it. I LOVE the original Hexcells and recommend it wholeheartedly. It's a casual, relaxing little game that introduces you to some new puzzles that will stretch your mind a little by challenging you to think in a new way. A lot of people compare it to Minesweeper, with the major distinction being that you never have to guess in Hexcells. You can reach the solution to each puzzle with logic alone. The difficulty curve on the original is great and most likely the whole way through you're going to have a smile on your face and feel enough of a challenge as new methods are introduced. Is it going to leave you wanting more? More than likely. That's where Hexcells Plus comes in and why I was really looking forward to it. Did it provide me with more Hexcells? Yes. Did it give me more of the Hexcells I love? No. The new puzzle solving techniques introduced in Hexcells Plus, although a logical progression, take it too far. What the original Hexcells has in common with Minesweeper (other than searching a grid to mark empty and occupied tiles) is an addictive simplicity. In Hexcells Plus, by making things more complicated to up the difficulty level, some of that charming simplicity is lost and sorely missed.  Bottom Line - Hexcells Plus is not simply more Hexcells. It will most appeal, I think, to people who felt the original was too easy. I thought the orignal was just right. Hexcells Plus isn't a bad game by any means and I'm happy to support the developer but it's hard not to compare it to the original and be a little disappointed.",

            "review_text": " What is Hexcells Plus?  Hexcells Plus is the successor to Hexcells, a puzzle game that looks rather like Minesweeper. Players are presented with an orange grid comprised to hexagons and it is up to them to determine whether these cells belong to the blue pattern or not (black cells). The black cells not part of the pattern have a number in them to indicate how many blue cells are adjacent to them, thus providing a clue as to how to proceed. After completing a puzzle the player is awarded blue hexcells based on the amount of mistakes made; these in time accumulate to unlock one of five new areas - allowing you to complete more difficult puzzles. Some areas also introduce new clues and rules to help you, making the puzzles more complex over time.  New additions for the puzzles include blue cells with a number that denotes how many other blue cells are present within a two-cell radius and black cells with a question mark, making it impossible to know whether there are any adjacent blue cells.  Although similar to Minesweeper as mentioned, there is a key difference: there is always a logical next step. You never have to take a gamble so if you feel stuck, take a step back and focus on another area.   Why I recommend the game  Hexcells Plus is a very simple puzzle game in its visual design. The menu is simple and provides the players with the option of turning the ambient music on or off and selecting one of three save slots. The same can be said for the puzzles themselves; a grid of hexagons on a white backdrop. To me this is good design, as I'm here for the puzzles and that's where the focus clearly lies. The puzzles themselves are interesting and more difficult than the original Hexcells, which is a plus.  However, multiple problems I had with the original game are also present here. For instance, it is still not possible to erase a save slot so starting completely from scratch is not an option if all three slots are in use. My biggest problem with Hexcells Plus is that, like its predecesor, there is no option to save mid-puzzle forcing you to either finish it or redo the part you already completed next time.  All that being said, as I have recommended Hexcells and this game is an improvement with the new rules and harder difficulty, I would encourage those interested in puzzle games to give this one a try.",

Becomes more oblique with having to remember what everything means, but at least numbers in blue hexes are more intuitive than different bracketed numbers. Still fun, similar soundtrack to the original (tolerable but ignorable) and generally addicitive, though with puzzles that require even more of a hunt to find the number you haven't completed yet (because there are more numbers to sort through).  If you liked the first, get it, if you didn't don't bother. Start with the first game regardless as it will show you what all three games are about. They go on sale often enough, and the discount for getting all three isn't significant enough to not try one before getting the rest.",

Either that, or the game doesn't teach you how to solve more complex configurations in the same way the first game does. In both cases, I felt the quality level/puzzle design was inferior to the first game.   Still, I played all the levels, so if you like the first one, check this one out too.",
