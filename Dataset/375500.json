            "review_text": "Its fun but the lag between actions really hurts this games potential. It reminds me of some of the d&amp;d series adventures. You were allowed to do one action every couple of seconds. Back in the 90s that was fun because it was new but these days i really like grimrocks methods better. Don't know if this is a purposeful limitation or something to do with the game engine used.",

            "review_text": "This is a reasonably enjoyable but tough old school dungeon romp. While it recalls other games, it isn't quite as complex -- no food to worry about, and no throwing of rocks for example.  The game took me about twelve hours to go through. There are thirteen levels, but some of them have extra 'sublevels'. All levels seem to have secrets to find, and I certainly did not find them all in my run through. All the levels have the same stone walls you see in the screenshots.  Don't expect a large variety of monsters (I saw seven unique types, though two or three had a variant). They all behave the same -- get close enough for them to see you, and they will try to chase you. It took a while to even discover you can backstab them for 2x damage -- if you catch them with their back turned.  I expected turning off the lamp to be useful at some point, but it never seemed to do anything.  I ran into two glitches of note.    Normally once you clean out a level the monsters are gone and the doors are all unlocked/open. But coming back up the stairs I twice had the experience that the level was reset. Once I was able to at least defeat the monsters again, and get some duplicate loot (armor). But once I was trapped near the stairs back down, as a teleporter to get to the rest of the level had turned off.    A few times the game froze up going up or down the stairs, right after it autosaved and before the animation played. Luckily I was just able to Alt tab out, close the game, relaunch, reload the autosave, and continue playing.  ",
