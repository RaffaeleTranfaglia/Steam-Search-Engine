Features I like: + Involving, dark story. + Beautiful graphics and style, + Atmospheric soundtrack, + Very satisfying and 'meaty' combat model, + Faction system with bounties and nemezis hunting (though I've never faced any), + Devotion system, + Festival of loot, + Good crafting system, + Lots of components, aguments and item-granted skills which provide wide variety of builds, + Day/night and wheater system, + At some point it's quite challenging (over 70 deaths druing 90h of gameplay), + I haven't try multiplayer yet, but I am sure it's very, very fun (instanced or FFA loot, combat with friends, etc.), + Easy, reasonable travel system, + Vast locations filled with details and less linear than in most aRPGs, + Lots of hidden treasuers, places and secret quests, + Possibility to rotate and zoom camera and map, + Modding tools with huge possibilites, + Class dualism.. + .. but it would be awesome to add new classes (TQ:IT had 9). However, it's definitely great with 6 various classes at the moment. + One of the best price/quality deals, + Hardcore mode.  Features I'm neutral about: * Consistent world - I couldn't feel Cairn division into acts, * Lack of character customization (only male/female - same as TQ), * Absence of shrines with buffs (present in TQ), however I think they're not necessary here, * I have a problem with memorizing locations, NPCs and major bosses names, * Lack of Polish language, * After 90h of gameplay my character is at lvl.. 78/85. * After creating new character it doesn't show up instantly - player must go to options and come back to main menu to see it.  Things I dislike: - Aetherfire (green flame on the ground) and poison pools are bit overpowered, - Few animations should be improved (e.g. stonetusks), - Sometimes vision gets too dark, - Ocassionaly crashes at alt-tabbing or game exiting.  Incoming first DLC - Crucible - is a hope for a better endgame content with a chance for ranking rivalry and source of loot (hopefully also new). I believe that future content will make this game one of the best aRPG's of all time (for me it is now).  A must have - not only for aRPG genre lovers!    9,5+/10  ",

            "review_text": "*12-20-16 edit at bottom  I recommend this title, only to true ARPG fans, with some very strong caveats. While I have had a lot of fun (and frustration) playing Grim Dawn, it's unforgivable weakness is in its late game balance.   Obviously GD draws a lot of comparisons to Diablo 2 and 3. While it is better in some regards, worse in others, as those titles, it simply does not have their longevity. I've clocked in just over 2,000 hours in Diablo 3. I have around 10% that time in GD, and I feel that I've taken it as far as I can go.   First, what is not as good as D2 and D3, as well as some other ARPGs: Loot and balancing. I have ran 4 different builds to the point I simply couldn't get any further. The difficulty settings of D3 is what allows for endless gameplay. In GD you start on Normal (with an optional Veteran difficulty that I honestly could not tell the difference except that there was less loot), then unlock Epic after completing the campaign, then unlock Ultimate after completing it on Epic. That's it, 3 difficulties, 3 times through the campaign, done. With level cap at 85, and no further options to continue playing, the game basically stops itself. However, of my 4 different builds, only one made it to the bitter end. And this is what I'm talking about balance here. What makes Epic and Ultimate more difficult is primarily the reduction of your resistances. So basically, you just die more often, xp becomes a grind, common minions often one-hit you out of nowhere, and some bosses (the trapped-in-a-box, no-retreat bosses) are simply unbeatable without the right build and very specific resistances. All that wouldn't be so bad, IF the game's claim that more difficult = better loot. But in over 200 hours of playing, I can tell you that it's just not true. If anything, I consistently got less good loot, but lots more junk loot. In every case, I was using the same equipment for 20 or more levels at a time for lack of getting anything better. Obviously, this is untenable when the monsters level with you. And the best gear I had was purchased, not looted. Over the course of 4 builds to Ultimate, up to levels 65 and 75 on average, I accumulated a sum total of 9 Legendary items, mostly unusable because of high requirements, or simply not as good as the epic items I already had from 20 levels ago. What this means is that I got rich, with just over 3 million iron bits on my final character, but with nothing worthwhile to spend it on. So yes, GD is miserly with the good loot. Not a good feature when we all know that ARPGs are all about the loot. Even after the latest patch, I did a test run from middle to late Ultimate, and only got one legendary; the same gun that the Warden drops every time. Well I already had 3, thanks anyway. One could put the loot, or lack thereof, down to bad luck, but after 4 playthroughs, I can reasonably claim it's the system.  Now, what makes GD better than D3: Character builds and skills. In D3 you get what you get as far as skills, they will be the same skills every time, they unlock at certain levels and at higher levels you can choose between them. That's it. This is the weakest point of D3. It sucks. GD has taken a step back with skills, more in line with D2, and allowed you to choose skills, then build on those preferred skills. And the passive skill tree is actually a constellation of skills that unlock new abilities or new attributes that you can then attach to whatever skill you prefer. This system allows for a high level of customization and control in your build, and is where GD really shines. The innovation of dual-class hybridization exponentially expands on the possibilities. Other good qualities are the lore, which is enough to keep you reading the notes, and the faction system. Factions are probably the best innovation to set GD apart from others in the genre.   One other detractor worth mentioning: Performance.  Even on lower settings, with reduced resolution, I constantly got lags and hitches, little micro-freezes. The gameworld is graphically nice, nothing extreme, so I think the problem is with distant LODs. It's as if the engine is trying to render too much at full detail, even long distance views and off-screen terrain. And shadow rendering seems to be glitched. They only look normal on higher settings. At medium and lower settings, the shadows glitch in a frenzied flashing of black triangles. Also, the game almost always freezes on exit, requiring alt-tab-del and a system reboot. This is extremely irritating and almost unforgivable in modern games.  In summary, Grim Dawn is a ton of fun for the true ARPG fan. Just trying out the different builds and hybrid classes is what makes it worthwhile. However, the miserly loot system and terrible late game balance gives it a short shelf life. My hours in GD had many frustrating moments where I nearly quit for good. But the character options kept me coming back to try again... with the same results. Certainly, D3 had a much bigger budget and amounts to pure candy for the ARPG fan, while GD is grittier, tougher, less rewarding. D3 has longevity, you can literally play forever. But GD got the most crucial part right that D3 got wrong; the role-playing. And that has made it worth playing.  *12-20-16 Edit: With recent updates addressing some of the issues I originally wrote about in this review, namely late game balance, I felt it warranted an edit. They have increased resistance buffs almost across the board for epics, making late game progression much more balanced and viable for a variety of builds. There have been many other improvements, but I felt this was the most significant.  CrateGames has continued to update and improve this game, with more on the way, including two new classes, presumably in a free update. This kind of dedication to their game sets them apart and could very well make Grim Dawn my favorite ARPG of all time.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing ARPG's since Diablo, am a firm believer that Diablo II: Lord of Destruction is the best ARPG ever made and Diablo III: Reaper of Souls is not a true successor to the series. Besides that I've also put time and effort in Torchlight II and Path of Exile, which I both found to be better than Diablo III but which still couldn't satisfy my ARPG need. Now I've purchased Grim Dawn early on but due to performance issues I was unable to play it at that time (which have been fixed) and I left it until recently.  My experience comes from playing Act I in Hardcore Veteran mode, both solo and with friends in multiplayer. The difficulty at Veteran -which is a modifier to Normal difficulty, increasing the amount of 'Hero enemies' and the rewards that you reap from them- is very solid. You will roughly level from 1 to 18-20 during Act I, during which I got the feeling that this game is quite well balanced. Sometimes you will feel weak, but most of the time that is to be fixed with reassigning your skills.  The overal look and feel of this game is, like the name implies; Grim. It's dark and 'serious', like Diablo II and Path of Exile. No cartoon art-style as Diablo III or Torchlight II. Personally I find this to be a big plus, seeing as this gives the game a more serious presentation.   The unique point of this game is that you start the game without choosing a class, called masteries in Grim Dawn. Once you reach your first level you gain the option to select one out of six masteries; Arcanist, Demolitionist, Nightblade, Occultist, Shaman, Soldier. Each mastery has an unique and fun skill tree with enough skills to keep you trying out stuff for a while.   Just like in Diablo II you will have to assign attribute points to either Physical (health), Cunning (melee) or Spirit (mana). A lot of gear you will find will require X points into Physical and either X points in Cunning or Spirit, depending on the kind of gear (weapon type, heavy or normal armor).  This goes on until you reach level 10, at which the game presents you to choose a (optional) second mastery. You can choose to combine masteries to supplement your character with additional skills that would otherwise be impossible to get, or to ignore this and go deeper into your previously selected mastery. Based on the combination of masteries you've chosen, your character class title will change to something else. The option of adding a second mastery will stay definitely once level 10 has been reached. The current level-cap is 85.  All in all this game feels refreshingly good and comes close to the feeling I've got while playing Diablo II: Lord of Destruction, but without the bots running all the games. If you need something different from Diablo III, Torchlight II or Path of Exile, this is it.",

The music and ambient sounds are very good in the game. +So far the areas seem very nicely made. Act 1 was made dark and scary and full of scary monsters and enemies. +I like that the game has different difficulty levels. I am playing veteran and it really feels like veteran difficulty. +loot system is what it is supposed to be.The harder the difficulty the more loot, simple. So far I've been getting very good items which help me against harder enemies. +voice actors. I think this is personal taste, but in my opinion the voices fit for the NPCs. +crafting system. So far I've haven't tried it that much, but in higher levels my guess you will need it more. +You can remove one point from skill tree for a price which is good. You can try out other builds without starting new character.  So far no cons come in my mind, but I am going to definitely recommend this game for all ARPG lovers. I bet if the game becomes more popular we might see a expansion for the game and the developers will keep patching the game to keep the game popular.",

This game is the ultimate ARPG cocktail. Titan Quest's and Diablo 2's perfect child.  Only thing that I really don't like about this game is the monotonous atmosphere and the very limited color palette that the developers chose for the artwork. Every single zone seems to be the same as the previous one. But the fantastic gameplay itself compensates for this flaw.  Pros: - Huge variety in skills and builds, only surpassed by PoE - Every character can have two classes at the same time and you can combine their skills and traits - Many different upgradeable items, armor and weapons - Very interesting boss fights - Faction system, where you can get reputation points for doing quests/slaying monsters for each faction - Huge replay value, your decisions matter in every playthrough + you have to try all the builds  Cons: - Monotonous artwork and atmosphere - Questlines can be confusing, you can get stuck and might not know where you should go next  I would totally recommend this game to any RPG/ARPG fan, especially ones who miss the good old Diablo and Titan Quest days, and the game has a reasonable price as well!  9/10, Nashud",

            "review_text": "****Review summary at the end****  I bought Grim Dawn about a year ago, when it was in Early Access. I played it for a few hours, but didn't give it enough time to realize the beauty hidden underneath the upgraded Titanquest game engine.  Because, up to this point, Path of Exile has been my absolute favorite ARPG, I follow ZiggyD on YouTube. He posted a video about how the game was just about to be fully released in a couple days, and recommended the game for people who like PoE and ARPGs in general, so, remembering that I had the game in my library, I figured I would actually give it a real shot this time.  A few hours in, and I realized this game had a lot of potential. About 43 hours later, I'm now realizing this game is incredible.   One of the things that bugged me about the game initially was how my character movement sort of felt like I was gliding over the ground, instead of actually being affected by gravity like someone in real life. It's the same phenomenon you can experience in Bethesda games like Fallout 3 and Skyrim, if you zoom out to third person (haven't played F4 so I don't know whether this has changed).   However, this is a very minor misgiving that I quickly got over. I soon realized that the game has a lot of other really, really good things to enjoy about it, and truth be told, the engine ain't all that bad. In fact, I think they did a great job on the lighting and some of the particle effects in the game, especially the blood, vitality, and chaos effects.  Enough graphics talk, though!  The action does feel very good, and it doesn't take long for your character to start feeling powerful. I feel like Path of Exile struggles with this. While maybe not as pronounced as Diablo 3, Grim Dawn does have ragdoll physics and great sound effects to make combat very enjoyable. There are also nice additions like combat numbers that aren't in PoE.  The class system is fantastic - you'll be able to choose a primary class at level 2, and then at level 10 you'll choose your secondary class. You get to combine two of the six classes in the game. Initially, this doesn't sound groundbreaking, but the skill trees for each class have so many different options that it opens up an incredible amount of builds that are possible! I've only made 2 characters so far (one of which was my first one, a year ago), only one of which I really count, so I can't wait to try out some amazing builds!  I have only completed normal difficulty so far, but one thing I love about this game is how I have been able to experiment liberally with my build, without being severely punished for doing so. I feel like Diablo 3 makes builds completely trivial, while on the other hand Path of Exile has a ton of amazing build options, but is harshly unforgiving if you make a mistake with your build.  Grim Dawn (again, so far - because I haven't played the second two difficulties) strikes the perfect balance between the these two extremes by adding a small cost to each point you refund in your skill tree. This gives you the ability to experiment, but doesn't trivialize character builds by just letting you swap them out whenever you want.  Another thing the game has going for it is the exploration. Normally with ARPGs, I reach the endgame quite quickly and start the usual grind. It's to be expected that you'll be grinding for gear in this genre. However, I feel like I get burned out leveling new characters quickly these days in ARPGs. Maybe this is my own fault, but a lot of times there just isn't much reason to explore, so it becomes a race to endgame.  In Grim Dawn, the game gives you great reason to explore every nook and cranny, because there are actually secret areas that spawn randomly. These areas may even contain questgivers and new hero monsters to fight, and they must be found by searching around the map for hidden walls and other places that are not indicated by the map. This really makes the leveling process enjoyable, and it gives you a reason to explore the game!  The loot is also great. I feel like they found the right balance between frequency and rarity. Fun loot drops all the time, but not so much that it isn't exciting anymore.  Summary:  Visuals: 8/10 Sound: 8/10 Visceral-ness of combat/Character combat feel: 9/10 Lore: 8/10 Class system: 9/10 Loot system: 9/10 Replayability: 10/10  Overall value/bang for your buck: Off the charts!  If you like action RPGs, stop thinking and go buy it!",

            "review_text": "UPDATED REVIEW: So, Grim Dawn has been finally Released and I beated the game, I am very happy with this game, TQ Devs did a great job in TQ and GD. Grim Dawn in the Release had, and maybe still has, some issues with AMD gpus but also my NVIDIA card burned to death in a area that I don't wan't to spoil but be ware of Mid Act 2 Side Area. It has a controller support, i haven't really tested but my Wireless Xbox 360 Controller was automatically dected. Now let's talk about my impressions about loot and Gameplay,The Loot might be better than Diablo 3 for you but for me, who played Diablo 3 Trial to level 15, It was way better. The Game has 4 difficulities which 2 are given by default and 2 are given when you complete the game on that Difficulity for Example:Normal,Veteran-&gt;Elite-&gt;Ultimate(yes those are the 4 difficulities). If you play on Normal you will play like a normal ARPG but in Veteran you will get much better loot than Normal, also the monsters are a bit difficult for Casters, for me a tank self healer, it was easy to defeat every boss. The World is very big and it might get bigger(I saw some fields on the map very far from the towns and in Beta there was a Area that got cutted). Gameplay wise, it's a ARPG which you control your character with your mouse and has 1-0(10) Skill hotkeys and LMB,RMB, also it has an additional quickbar by pressing Y,also like i said you will love loot in the final difficulities, though it might get borring finding the legendaries you want. Conclusion:The game has a lot of quest to offer; 1 endless dungeon for loot; 4 difficulities,which in 2 of those you have to start over its like NG+ don't worry you won't be naked but you might be if you didn't prepare for Ultimate or Elite, hehe, Anyway I think this game is worth the money and if you want to play their old games, buy TQ(you might notice it's not made by Crate Entertaiment. Crate Ent. is the newest TQ company that has old members of TQ company)  ORIGINAL REVIEW: This ARPG has a nice atmosphere, in the begining you are at a dark world but in Act 2 you are at a semi-bright world, I honestly think this game will be the most popular  ARPG,why?  beacuse its gonna have mod support,it(might) wont have problems in the launch.The game itself has a really wierd story and its grindy but for those who like grinding games they wont get bored easily.The Lengedary loot as i read is gonna be 1 per character but it might change beacuse the game is designed for level 200 so it might have like a low or medium chance to get lengedaries in level 60,75(Release level).This game features a dungeon where(im pretty sure) you wont get bored,that dungeon is challanging and has a good loot and as you go to many floors it gets harder, if you die you have to go to those floors all over again. The game has even a hardcore mode if you really wanna loose all your stuff you can do that,I havent gone into hardcore mode but im 100% sure it wont give you any bonuses it will be just a challange.  What I forgot to say is,the game is based on a apocalyptic dark world where there is only some surviours but some are enemies,and you can do some side quests with the enemies side also the max level for now is 35.",

This is much closer to Titan Quest... and better too in pretty much everyway (and I like Titan Quest). A different, slightly more complex, experience than Diablo 3, it's effects are not quite as good (but then, what ARPG can boast better?) but the gameplay is great and the hours soon fly by. Also ... local coop! Great to see this still being supported in a modern game. Highly recommended.",

Pros - Extremely expansive and detailed character build system. 110.5 hrs in and I could keep making characters for years! The synergies between the skill trees, constellations, augmentations, components, etc. is very deep.  - Great graphics and scenery. The world is beautiful, monsters and gear look great.  - Great crafting system  - Grimdark setting that is actually grim and dark. Like the journals I found of a family that resorted to prostituting their 11 year old out to survive, eventually turning to murdering the johns and canabalizing them as they succumbed to the blood god. Savage.   Cons - Too much loot. Set your filter to yellow as a minimum, green is better. The amount of trash loot is simply obscene. That and 'rare' items just rain form the sky to the point that you will find yourself swapping out Epic/Legendary items with a copy that is .001% better on a somewhat regular basis.  - Difficulty is disappointing. Too easy most of the time, then occassionally you get an enemy that is over the top. Wish it was consistently more difficult without the giant spikes. Won't be an issue for many, but if you are good with numbers, this game will feel like easy mode a lot of the time.  - The map system is lacking. The world is expansive and fantastic, but finding your way around can be annoying until you get familiar with the world of Cairn.  - The default camera I feel is to claustrophobic and does not do the game justice at all. Get Grim Cam and spend some time getting it set up to your liking. It is a VAST improvement that really makes the world come to life.   It has some flaws, but still worth it and the only recent Diablo-like worth playing right now imo. ",

            "review_text": "Titan Quest 2: Steampunk edition. No, this isn't a criticism, I loved TQ, and Grim Dawn lovingly thieves TQ's corpse of a lot of key gameplay elements (no surprise, as most of Crate Entertainment is made up of TQ's devs, if memory serves correctly)     Equipment: Grim Dawn's gear consists of a typical loot-fests' prefixed and affixed 'Ascended Warrior's [item] of Everlasting Pain and Death of the Fox'-type loot generation, with a fair smattering of weapon archetypes to choose from at the moment (swords, daggers, two-handers, rifles, pistols, crossbows, etc.) You can buy these super-overpriced from friendly merchants in town, or just kill special bosses or minibosses and get drops from them. Armor is spread about, consisting of a familiar spread -- helmet, torso, legs, feet, shoulders, gloves, and then slots for amulets, two rings, medals (like, military rewards, yeah), and relics. These last few are more specialized and, like most other H&amp;Ss, are usually more utilitarian, offering not specific DPS or defense boosts, but general stat buffs.     Upgrades: Gear can be 'gemmed' (Diablo 2 callback) in a sense. As you kill enemies, you'll collect fragments of upgrade items. Combine them (just smash them together in-inventory, no need for special NPCs or items) and you get the 'completed' item. You can upgrade gear with this stuff at any point, complete or not, with completion usually maxing out the stat/effect bonus the item uses, in addition to adding an additional ability. Certain things will only fit into certain gear (upgrades increasing weapon damage can only fit into, well, weapons). And no, there's no slot-tracking to keep in mind, for better or for worse -- a completed upgrade piece is a big investment into a piece of gear you know you'll keep for a while (or maybe it's just an upgrade that you don't even really like).      Crafting: This'll feel quite familiar to Diablo 3 players. You get a Blacksmith NPC after some time out in the field who will craft stuff for you. This can be randomly-rolled items, or it can be super-upgrades, combining several of the previously-mentioned upgrades into a single, more powerful item with different effects altogether. Most crafting costs one or several of a few unique crafting-only materials you find afield (Scrap, Aether Crystals, and Tainted Brain Matter, to name a few gooey examples). Crafting is also the only way to make Relics, which is an item for one of your fairly-numerous inventory slots.     Skilltrees/Masteries: This is what I am very grateful that the TQ devs put into Grim Dawn. What set TQ, and by inheritance, Grim Dawn, apart was the way it handled skills. See, you don't say 'I'm a Wizard!' when you start the game, and only ever learn magic spells. What happens is, the first time you level up, you choose your skilltree. Right now, there's: -- Soldiers (lots of general self-buffs and damaging abilities, not flashy but strong) -- Occultists (Summoner-type character, can have a variety of pets or a single strong one, depending how you build it, and with debuffs to cast on enemies and a handful of offensive spells) -- Demolitionists (the ranged class, intended to use guns as there's skills that specifically focus on their use. Has a bunch of 'gadgets' that can supplement DPS, like grenades, traps, etc.) -- Nightblade (the rogue class, lots of movement/positioning skills, with focus on critical hits and powerful damage buffs) -- Arcanist (the caster, has a range of offensive and defensive spells from single-target to AoEs). -- Shaman (sort of like a spellsword, if that spellsword used a two-handed weapon. Skills are much along the path of the Diablo 2 Necromancer's totems.)  The coolest part is that, at level 10, you choose a SECOND Mastery, if you so choose. Or, you can refrain from doing so, and simply keep pouring points into your first Mastery. This is a good idea sometimes, as GD also has a very strong focus on synergizing skills -- rather than just give you a billion abilities, you only get a handful per Mastery. But as you level up the Mastery, you unlock new skills that branch off of each ability's 'tree', adding additional effects. You can pour points into this new effect for better stats on that effect... OR you can put points into the initial skill.  Say you have a magic missile ability, for example. You put a single point into it to unlock it. If you put more points into it, it increases damage of type A. But, if you put points into a skill down the tree, you might unlock an explosion effect that deals damage over time of type B! So you could feasibly just unlock a skill for use, then never touch the initial skill again, if later branches in the tree have effects you prefer.     Instant warp-to-town: Hardly bears mentioning, as it is more or less standard for H&amp;Ss nowadays, but yeah. Free travel back to town at any time without needing to carry around town portal scrolls.     NOT from TQ, but instead new to GD: you can unlock new areas by collecting enough Scrap (one of those crafting mats, you may recall) and iron bits (the 'gold' of this world) and building a bridge. In some cases, this can speed up forward progression... or you can go in a completely different direction from where the game seems to be railroading you. A very nifty way to make you feel a bit less like you're just moving in a straight line through the game.   One thing I do find kind of lackluster is building your character outside of skill choices. Character stat-building is more or less dependent on Mastery Selection, as points into the Mastery (which counts as a skill point use, so keep track) will not only unlock new skills, but give you general stat increases relevant to the Mastery (big 'Physique' stat increase for Soldier, 'Cunning' for Demolitionist, 'Spirit' for Arcanist, etc., and a smaller amount of a mixture of the other stats). These are the three stats you can really directly affect, actually. Each is a catch-all for a variety of engine numbers (Physique is Health, Defense value, etc.; Cunning affects chance-to-hit and chance-to-be-hit; Spirit affects your Mana/Energy, damage of spells, etc.) Beyond Mastery skill points, you get precisely ONE (1) choice of stat to increase, from those three, per level. It's a moderate increase, to be sure (like 5 or 6 points), and yes, it's meant to supplement the Mastery's auto-assignment (which is 9 times out of 10 an accurate representation of the stats you usually need for that Mastery to shine), but for some it might feel like it's railroading players a bit too strongly.  If you liked TQ, this game is a no-brainer -- It's TQ2, or might as well be. If you're a general H&amp;S RPG fan (liked Torchlight 1 and/or 2, Diablo 1, 2, or 3, Path of Exile, Dungeon Siege 1 or 2, Sacred 1 or 2, etc. etc.), you might want to look through the gameplay videos and see if you might be interested. Otherwise... well, you kind of HAVE to be used to the genre to really 'get' the appeal of this game. If clicking on loot pinatas until they die and mashing Alt to see what they dropped isn't appealing to you, you're probably better off skipping over this one.",

            "review_text": "Grim Dawn is a very appropriate name for this game, especially if you are a fan of the Diablo franchise. Diablo 1 may not have been the first ARPG, but it certainly put the genre of tearing monsters apart until they explode in a shower of blood and shinny items on the map. The game that made birthday pinatas a bit lack luster from there onwards. While Diablo 1 was the promising toddler, Diablo 2 was the 12 year old son who won the science competiton nation wide. Everything seemed to be going well.  Then diablo 3 launched and it was like walking in on your teenage son dying his hair black, cutting his wrist, wearing eye liner, and wearing bandages like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ sonic the hedgehog game. What the ♥♥♥♥ happened, I knew I souldnt have let your creepy black sheep uncle to take you to disney world.   Back to the point, Grim Dawn is both grim in the game setting and grim because playing it is a constant exercise in 'what if' when thinking of Diablo 3. Suffice to say if you found Diablo 3s bright art style of smeared water paintings with lighting effects as ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as possible for lower end PCs to run it rather diapointing, as well as its borderline incoherant story and a disjointed world forgettable despite over 100 hours played than you will be in for a nice suprise.  Visually Grim Dawn made me think this is diablo 2 but with better graphics. The game plays on this and it does a very good job for the disenchanted ARPG player. The marshes, caves, ruined settlements, and bleak landscape of Act 1 bring back fond memories of the Rogue Encampment. It makes the whole art petition response look silly in retrospec, along with Reaper of Souls going back on it as well.  While the story and universe is not a high point it is practically shakespeare compared to Diablo 3. The documents you find are well paced and some are pretty disturbing and depressing. On top of that there are moments in the game where your decisions can have ramifications although the steam page does exagerate a bit.   The game is made from a combination of the creators of TitanFall and I believe a few people who worked on the origional Diablo. TitanFall was a baffling game as Im assuming the publisher didnt understand that 50% of what makes these games enjoyable is watching monsters turn into pools of blood. Opting to go for the teen rating and showing a complete ignorance to the genre. I do have a beef with these guys on the part that Titan Falls expansion seemed to never get fixed.....  That said it would seem the ugly practice was left behind in the world of Greek Mythology and didnt carry over to Cairne.   For people like myself who found Blizzards odd skill system or lack there of a skill system bewildering (something that would carry over to World of Warcraft) you will be happy to know that Grim Dawn has more stats than the guy who sits with a spread sheet at a baseball game taking notes on everything for some bizaare reason. Perhaps reliving his desire to be an assistant coach in the dugout. You have stun resistence, stun duration reduction, lightning damage, electricicty damage, fire damage, burn damage, piercing damage, vitality damage, and you get the point.  The wonderful Titan Quest duel class system returns allowing players to mix different classes that seem odd but turn out very interesting. What is nice is that there does not seem to be 1 spec for each of the class combinations. My main is a Warder which is a combination of the soldier and shaman. I focus on 2 handed weapons and lightning damage but there are 2 other viable paths I have read about. I imagine the same is true for other combos.   Certain gear and the fairly elaborate addon system can be a huge part of your build. One item I added to my axe gave me a lightning nova ability which was great for clearing large groups. Lousy on its own but with all my + lightning skills and gear stats very effective.   There is also a faction system. Getting higher rep means you can buy items from said faction and the more hated you are by enemy factions the more rare bosses that spawn. Speaking of loot you wont have to farm for hours only to get items that look like a troll put them in the game.   Unfortunately with a small team does come its problems. The framerate is all over the place depending on where you are with the beginning act being the worse offender. Many enemies simply explode into blood and there are not as many unique death animations as you would get with a larger team. The enemy variety is also limited compared to other games. All of this just makes you wish these guys had more resources at their disposal. Nothing is really game breaking.  In summary I have not enjoyed a game in this genre so much since diablo 2. Torchlight never really did it for me and you all know my opinion of diablo 3 at this point. If anything I say resonates with you then this game will be a nice gem to add to your steam library.  ",

The best part of the game to me is the fact that, while a bit of a grind like a lot of other games in this genre, combat isn't dragged out by a monster with over a billion health. Bosses are tough, sure, but it won't take you 10 minutes of running in a circle, because the skills you have available can actually allow you to fight properly. On top of that, the world is massive. At the time of writing, at 14 hours or so of gameplay, I am not even a third through the game. Which is a good sign. And I can go back time and time again to the same place to grab loot for crafting.  The only con, and this is the only thing that frustrates me, is the fact that when a lot of items drop, such as when a boss dies, my game stutters. Not lags, but stutters. And this happens when I pick up items. There's a few quickfixes that reduce the effect, but it's not gone completely.   However, I can live with it. For this game, for the story and the gameplay, I can live with it. Everything else has been a blast, and well, it's not a game I have been able to walk away from. This game took me away from Fallout 4, which, is a big deal for me. So I'd recommend giving it a go. It'll be worth it.  EDIT: Item drop lag is gone.This game is a solid 100% for me now.

The game has a good interesting story, although it's very digressive because of multiple factions, I often was confused with the multiple 'main' plots. Don't get me wrong side-quests are a good thing, it's just that I felt there wasn't a compelling main story. I've finished the game I thought 'That was it?'. Aside from that the stories and quests are very well written and presented, specially the ones you collect as lore items, it was intriguing to always look for another piece to know what happened next. A big plus also for quest branches, allowing to actually change the game and story.  The gameplay is good, there's good amount of skills for each class with different builds and play-styles, not to mention the amount of masteries with the double-class sytem. The combat system often got me excited, often got me mad, it's great to put your skill to some use and not only the random click-fest that usually is ARPGs. I mean, there's interesting combat mechanics, like healers, and support mobs that have to be killed first, it's movement intense and you have to coordinate the skill usage.  The graphics are good, the scenery is dark, bloody and gothic, the animations though could be better, for example, the character animation when it's running often feels like it's on a roller blade, character posing stand-still is ugly, and often I got stuck in the environment after the animation of one of the movement skills I had.  Itemization is a problem, I got several items that I had no use for me while lacking items to progress the game, I understand this is a RNG game, although some sort of mechanism needs to be in place to fulfill this gaps, like the loot system implement in Diablo, or a quick and easy way to trade. Anyway going alone or 'self founded' as the community says is quite a task, and would demand a lot of time. That's the main reason I've got bored: looking after loot, not finding and knowing that would take a lot of time to get it.   TL;DR;  It's a good ARPG 'Diablo like' game with an well written story, good graphics and regular to poor animations. I definitely recommend if you like ARPGs.",

In the game there is a faction system that makes your choices matter A LOT. I really like it becuase it gives the game a lot of replayability, but it has one weakness :( after you beat the game the choices DO NOT RESET, and the factions stay the same. I was really exited beacuse i thought this got rid of 'THE ENDLESS GRIND' of most ARPG's; being able to play the game differently everytime you beat it would be a pleasure! But now i'm stuck continusly playing and doing the samething over and over and over again!!!!(story wise)... and I get it, this is so you play and experience more characters, but if i'm to play and dedicated a LOT of time to one character a little change every playthrough would be appreciated :D.  but other than that one problem the game is still a wonderful thing to play!

I have been playing this game on and off since Build 24 in early access, and I can safely say it's one of the best ARPGs on the market.  Five diverse classes, with a nice dual-class system and very interesting synergy between allows for a wide range of build types. Hundreds of extra skills available from items and components to further expand your build, or just add extra attacks for fun. On top of this is the Devotion system - by purifying shrines throughout Cairn, you gain points to spend on an extra level of customisation on top of the class system, and reaching some of the more esoteric constellations can unlock some very cool skill augments for your attacks. Want your kills to summon skeletons? Sure thing! Venemous spines erupting from the ground? Flocks of golden birds swooping through enemies? Done and done!  A surprisingly dark and adult story line, with some pretty well done voice acting and a wealth of in game lore to find which fleshes the game world out wonderfully. Choices that impact the game world along the way - the wrong choice could see a family, or worse, go up in flame...  Now, don't get me wrong, this game isn't 'perfect'. Building a successful character can be a little confusing and daunting for new players, although the Normal difficulty is well balanced to allow almost any build to beat it. More damage types than the average ARPG can make keeping resistances up (and beating enemy resistances) tricky, especially in the harder difficulties although to me this just adds to the depth of the game.  The game world is hand crafted rather than randomised, this may be an issue for you, but for me it's better to play through well made content than hodgepodge generic chunks slapped together into a 'dungeon' or 'area', so YMMV.  Monster design is excellent throughout, and it's not uncommon to be fighting huge swarms of enemies to almost insurmountable odds...until you destroy them all! Sound design is very good throughout as well, and I thoroughly enjoyed the soundtrack.   I look forward to seeing what Crate do with the world of Cairn in the future, and hope they build on and develop the game world further!",

Yes, if you read any of the reviews that is what just about everyone is saying. Some gamers, like Pinwolf, say it in an even more funny fashion (shout out to you Pinwolf-great post). A few hours into the game you will see what most gamers are referring to.  Grim Dawn allows you to pick unique gear and skills. As you play the game you earn coin, reputation from different factions you meet along the way, and earn points to be used in your class you have chosen, or skill trees within that class. Later in the game you get the opportunity to have a dual class and open even more skill trees. You can even take away skill points from one tree to use in a different skill tree of any class you have chosen. You can not, however, remove base points from the class you have chosen. As you max out your base points in a class you have the opportunity to apply points into elite skills within that class. These can be very useful!  The devotion points you may have read about are set up like constellations, one star in a constellation for one devotion point. The devotion points come from finding and purifying shrines. There are a couple of shrines late in the game that require you to progress through the storyline in order to be able to purify them so don't get discouraged all of you completionists. Some of the constellations have an ending star that is attached to a skill on your tree. This provides a seperate ability. Every time you use that skill you gain a higher rank within the ability. I look for these constellations and attempt to fill them first to use these valuable abilities.  Crafting is very cookie cutter. Find some blueprints, find the 'ingredients', go to the blacksmith and he will make it for you. You will complete quests that allow you to go to a person in the first main town that can break down items for parts or remove 'runes' that you have inserted into your items (as powerups) to be used on other items. You pick up these 'runes' through battles so be on the look out.   Your personal inventory bag is set up like other games in how it is laid out and managed. You gain access to more bag space in your personal inventory as you increase in level. Your 'bank' is literally guarded by a single person in the various areas you clear and you can increase slots through tabs on the left. You can also use the 'transfer' slots in your 'bank' to give all of your toons access to non soul bound items. I have three toons just to mess around with different builds and this has been very handy.   One thing I didn't read anywhere that I wish I had known previously is that several boss fights are in areas where if you die, you will respawn in the closest town, therefore you will have to run all the way back to the area in order to continue the boss fight. The boss gains some health back when you die, and will slowly regen health the longer it takes you to get back to finish them off. Set up a portal outside main boss areas or just don't ever die, either works.   There is much more to this game that meets the eye so jump in, have fun, create a few toons and see what skills and classes you like. Slan go foill!",

            "review_text": "New H&amp;SARPG game from the creators of Titan Quest, with the grimdark cthulhu + scrap-survival aesthetics. Game-play is similar to the Titan Quest, even loaning several mechanics from it, but a lot of outdated busywork was streamlined. The best part are reputation boosters, which you can give to your other heroes, so you won't need to grind as much.  Lowest difficulty is mostly a pleasant ride to the end, with couple of good items and mismatched skills, and without noticeable difficulty spikes in the main campaign. But on the elite+ the usual balance issues show themselves. On top of increasing enemies' stats, player character just receives extreme resistance penalty and cheap one-shots become a usual thing for any build, made not by the uniform min-max instructions. Ranged\\mage characters becoming very unpleasant to play, since they are stationary when attacking and can't kite well. Unlike Titan Quest advanced difficulties don't even bring much new content. And the most unpleasant part of the new balance, is the fact, that higher levels bring less and less points to spend, while requiring more and more grind, which sucks all the joy out of levelling-up. On top of that, level capped character can't fill even one skill tree, so dual builds are much less interesting, which also reduces player's ability to experiment.  Graphically the game is pleasant, art-style is cohesive and models are peculiar. But enemies are done so good, that you can only wonder, why are you, yet again, forced to play as plain boring humans, when you would rather play as cursed scarecrow or some beastkin. Game works just fine on UHD UWS Surround out of the box, but is very demanding.  Overall it's not as great as Titan Quest, but inherits a lot of it's flaws. It's a great time for a couple of casual playthroughs, but manages to become even more frustrating than Titan Quest on advanced difficulties. Diminishing returns of levelling-up hit hard player's incentive to spend more time in the game.",

So if you enjoyed TQ, you will most likely enjoy GD (as long as you didnt play Titan Quest just for the setting). For those who didn't play TQ, you will most likely enjoy GD if you are looking for:  - a smooth and responsive combat system - a dark and atmospheric setting (music, design etc.) - a diverse class system with a lot of possibilities - good old talent trees (yay) - tons of items with tons of different stats - factions with their own reputation and rewards - compared to other ARPGS a relatively challenging difficulty  I've played GD when it just hit EA on steam and they really improved every single aspect of the game until release.

            "review_text": "I'll be honest. Grim Dawn is a difficult game. It's difficult to chose a class, Every single class I've tried is just flat out done amazingly well. As a HUGE fan of aRPGs, I've played them all, bought them all, have them all in some capacity. Literally. Almost every damn one ever released. Grim Dawn is light years ahead of anything released lately or in years, as a matter of fact. I'll give it the 'I've played it for 75 hours and still haven't finished it' review. I'm not going to go into minute details. Just know the game rocks, and does it hard.    Graphically the game is like the Dungeon Siege games amped up on steroids and blasted in amazing detail. Remember playing the first Dungeon Siege and having your jaw drop at how beautiful the scenery, the verticality of it all played out? Grim Dawn has it in spades. Wonderful vistas, creepy forests, scattered and desolate deserts, creepy temples and underground dwellings and caves, and the ever wonderful 'secrets' that are scattered generously. The attention to detail is astounding. You'll find libraries full of books you can actually see, candelabras giving faint light on a desktop, small envelopes and letters scattered and blood spattered walls and streaks of death. Character armors and weapons are done very nicely and enviroments are teeming with sudden death if you're not careful. Weapon procs and effects are dazzling and spell effects will light up your immediate vicinity and give you a feeling of invincibility as you're hammering away at a bad guy with your lightning mace and destroying absolutely everything in sight. Pets come to your aid as you find yourself in a jam, if needed of course. Lighting everywhere trickles in spots and corners and enemies are cloistered in a room awaiting your arrival with surprise weapons of destruction.    Then you hear something walking. Stomping around, awaiting you. But where? You can't see them yet, it's dark, but you know they're there. Waiting. They'll come at you speaking curses and whispering death spells. The ambient music surrounds you with calling birds and trickling waters of a stream as you hear your pet walking and get a little scared. Just for a second. Major NPCs will speak to you in full dialogue and you'll be listening because it is important what you do. You'll find small pages of torn books and letters that flesh out a darker and sad secret, or maybe you'll find the reason the horror you're searching has done the things it has done. It will freak you out, just a little, that this world exists and you're tyring to help save it. Then you'll be searching for the terrors in the night as the music picks up and you know you're in the right place at the wrong time.    With a fully active mini map you'll still get lost in the vastness of the areas. You'll be searching for that special cave and come across a tomb. What waits for you inside is not a friend in need, or is it? NPCs will try to trick you from time to time and you'll be listening and reading for clues on the insanity that is the Grim Dawn. Ample storage space that increases from time to time will guarantee you're ready for anything, as long as you have that idle minute to look. Portals open at your beckon and you're guarateed safety if just for a minute to catch your breath. Then you'll leave again, with a better weapon, a shinier talisman, an upgraded pair of boots for your journey. You'll have discovered a full Devotion religion that will better prepare you and your pets for what lies ahead. There are NPCs awaiting your arrival to help guide you on your journey and better explain the evil in the dark that awaits you, then they will ask you to go kill it.    THIS is Grim Dawn. Easily one of the best aRPGs I've ever had the opportunity to experience. It doesn't neccessarily re-invent the arpg wheel, but it soups it up with the best engine, the most horsepower and the best kit and then lets you go on your merry way. Oh, and the view is pretty awesome too.",

At this point I've put almost 100 hours (almost all of them on Hardcore) into Grim Dawn and still look forward to trying new builds. Starting over has yet to feel tedious.   If you've played Titan Quest you know the core of the gameplay but the addition of the Devotion system is a pretty fun thing to play around with and the unique setting and story are enjoyable.

            "review_text": "So, Grim Dawn. The story of me acquiring this game was quite short - I saw it on torrents, read the description and thinking 'this game made by the people from Iron Lore, gotta be good'. The torrent was broken, quests didn't work, so I just went on to slash some monsters and try out the mechanic. Fifteen minutes later I said - 'I need this game right now'. It was the time of alpha-build at that time. And not for a second since did I regret about this purchase. If you wonder, yep, I have and totally played Diablo 3 at that moment. Don't even think of questioning my D2 expierence too.  That said, Grim Dawn is totally worth your money - it's damn good fot its price. And yes, it have alot of similarities to Titan Quest and to good extent. To make it more clear - imagine instead of 9 masteries you get only 6, but those are almost twise as massive and totally standalone - each one perform great without mixing. Instead of lush and colourful ancient world of myths and legends you get dark fantasy world of firearms and magic going side by side, where humanity is struggling after the Glorious Dawn of otherworldly Aetherials - the end of the world. From the beggining you know so little - you gain information piece by piece, in notes, dialogues, on a Devotion map. You reconstruct the events and the world like a puzzle and it's done in an interesting way. There are additions to the mechanic but one thing is still there - immersion, fun and a real desire to play on and on - new loot, new levels, more challenging monsters and dungeons.  So, you like dark fantasy? Worth it. Like solid ARPG's? Worth it. Still like TQ and have runs once in a while? Take Grim Dawn and have a new journey with good old mechanic. That means totally worth it. And yes, one more thing. No 3-rd party soft for multiplayer, so while Steam is alive - and that's for a long time - you and your friends can totally play together without additional magic. Crate guys earned your support.",

I wanted so much to like this title - However - I just have a lot of little irritating things that put me off- and its simple things that I feel hold this down and will keep it down if the Dev's arnt diligent- It crashes, its a constant back and forth to town and such a trudge ... (at first you need to farm lots of resource to open storage slots etc) The classes try hard to be complex when in truth, there only ends up (much like D3) to be a few cookie cutter builds that actually work best. Good try but, not worth the time, unfortunately.   I'll update that last statement ... it is the very best that's out at the moment so ... my bad.  Ok, so I feel I need to add a bit to the review to quell my own misgivings about the ONLY thumbs down I saw. the game really is -- very very good. its simply ... not done yet.  My note to self?-  Don't write reviews after you crash to desktop 3 times and then the game simply locks up and forces a hard reset of your PC.  My PC is no slouch either.  Multi-player is great in some aspects (true LAN party capability) but sucks overall. Chars are definitely well thought out - except for making your way to max level. If you arn't a fan of a TON of farming, this will def not be for you. I could add a lot more but I think I've hit on the major aspects that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off most. There';s more to like than to not like ... so ... here's a first for me I'm changing my thumbs down to a thumbs up ... with reservation and the truth that it is a truly a well attempted title.",

But you can't really dive into it.  Wishes: - Possibility to set permanent marks on the map - A quest marker which you can toggle on and off (sometimes you're hunting for a bounty and cant find that guy) - Possibility to create your very own weapon/ armor/ accessoire - More of the artwork like in the intro.

In all seriousness this is a Grim, Gritty and mature ARPG with some REALLY interesting looking Multi Class opportunities. I chose a Demolitioist because ....well guns and bombs (hey why not) and have just chosen Occultist as my secondary class which apparently now makes me a Pryomancer. Happy Days :)  I am currently facing the Hordes of Evil Filth (tm) with a Pistol that posions my enemies (and thanks to a special token lets me pierce armor) and shamanisic owl talisman dual wield set up and a Posioned Scrap Metal Maul as my second weapon set.  I have electrical jacks that stun and knockback my enemies, a flashbang to stun them along with a posionsed explosive eye weapon and a crow familair that shoots lightning. Take that typical fantasy tropes ! Oh and I also have a fiery aura that empowers my weapons and also gives me a on hit fire retaliation strike. Come get some :)  I cannot wait to see how I can alter and empower these abilites as I am only on level 11 so far. One thing to note is you have no control over your body type or looks, but honsetly once you are decked out in armor it really makes no difference. Once you have watched the intro movie it makes perfect sense why you just look like a generic human everyman/woman anyway.  The design of the enemies is very satisfying and all look sutiably twisted, gross and evil. And you just have to admire the ragdoll animations as you send them flying, turn them into teeny gibbets or make them explode in a hail of blood. As for the environs you are travelling.. well the Grim part of the title was not kidding... posionous pits, rotting junk yards, bits of corpses, burnt out husks of houses... the designers really turned up the `messed up` to 11.  If you love ARPGs, mature fanatsy settings or just kick ♥♥♥ action games I highly recommend giving this a go.   EDITED .. So I realised I just wanted to level up a few abilities both passive and active and not spread my points too thin as I had been a bit free with my points on all the shiny abilites.  You simply talk to an NPC in the Prison (starting hub) and for a modest fee in iron you can refund any points spent on nodes on the skill trees and re spend them as you see fit. I LOVE this feature as now you can undo any early mistakes you make with regards to the build you want.",

            "review_text": "I'd say this is a must buy for Hack&amp;Slash/ARPG fans.  I find Grim dawn is more of an improved formula on Diablo 2 when compared to Diablo 3, in regards to the way skills and level up stats are applied atleast. You get pretty awesome freedom in your character build; Every level 3 skill points and 1 stat, your chosen class has its skill tree with a class mastery skill, so you need to level up this mastery to be able to invest in higher skills. When you reach level 10 its also possible to pick a second class which opens up that classes full skill line. You are also free to respec all your invested skill points at a npc, for some coin, but I dont think its possible to change a class though, and I was also unable to remove my points that were in my mastery skill.  Crafting is also a pretty important part in this, you can find blueprints for all kinds of gear that special blacksmith can forge for you. There are also various crafting materials that you will find that can be used on the enviroment that will open different paths and new areas. There are Dynamite around to that can be used to blow open heavy locked chests, break weakened walls, and you use them to dismantle gear to materials.   1 Thing Ive noticed here is there is no, or atleast less randonly generated areas, atleast I think the overworld stays the same layout, even between sessions, but the caves and attached areas are generated? I can't say for sure.  Also all gear pretty much has one 'socket' where you can insert a modifier piece for stats, you'll find this items in little pieces and once you have 3 or so they can be combined for a complete 'gem', the boosts this items give has a wide variety too which is awesome.   I'll also say this feels like its a much tougher game than other similar games I've played. Maybe my build just sucks lol, but I find the big mobs that are mixed with range/melee can really cut you down fast espcially if theres atleast one elite monster in the group with them. It keeps you on your toes though, and youll want to find cover from range and funnel in your melee through a doorway or something.   Can't say much about the story, I havent completed it yet, or really read much of the lore books. The setting is pretty cool though I think.   And as for Graphics go, I'd say Grim Dawn looks really good, very nice effects/ explosions , gibs. the lighting is pretty, and there is a day night cycle I think.  So there you go, don't even wait for a sale. Buy this game right now it's under 30$",

Combat even on Normal is challenging and engaging with lots of enemies, bosses, and loot. Exploration rewarded through the discovery of shrines (grant you devotion points), lore items, side areas, and dungeons. As far as the main story goes it's your typical 'chosen one' affair with some narrative choice. There is a crafting system which I only dabbled in so I don't have much of an opinion on it other than it's pretty straightforward.

It does start out a little slow with the unlocking of your second build and finding the items to complete your build. and some of the classes do make it diffucult to make the 'Perfect' class but put it doesnt pull you away from the action and the killing of many, many creature and undead creatures.

They are hard to come by, as they should be. -Good Crafting system  -The skill tree is has good depth and the shrines add a nice part to it. -Scaling enemy difficulty is done well it is tough when it needs to be. The game starts slow but then it kicks it up in the 3rd and 4th act.  -Boss fights are well done and if you die you need to change how you fight that boss, you are doing somethign wrong. -Sound including music add to the atmosphere of the game. -Graphics look very good for an ARPG, the game runs very well at 1440p maxed out on a gtx 980 getting at lest 60fps most of the time.  Neutral -No random map generation, I would love it in this game but I am not going to count it as a con because maps are well crafted. -Sceret areas are mostly pointless, except there are a few really cool areas with some substance that keeps this from being a con.  Cons -Stairs suck in this game buggy you will get caught on them.  -Chest feel underwhelming, rarley do you get any good drops besides the one shot chest.

Visuals might be a little dated, but are definitely a pleasure to watch. Destroying monsters with last hit critical and see their body fly away never gets old.  Music is ok, helps sets the tone for the gameplay, but can get slightly repetitive.  Story, is unfortunately nothing to write home about, yet it doesn't ruin the experience, at least not for me.  Following the format of old ARPGs, completing the game on the normal difficutly opens up harder difficulties to play on.

In the end its kind of like a soap story. You yearn for that one girl or guy expecting joy and bliss yet only disappointment and emptiness finds you. You spend hours and days trying and hoping that somehow things will be different, only to realise at the end of it all, your one true love was right beside you all along.  GD is well worth your time and money. Graphics wise it might be a notch or two below D3, the theme a little niche but its still pretty good and where D3 has fallen short, GD delivered with a bang!

Even though it's just an alpha at the moment, it's one of the most fun games I ever played. There are some bugs, but most of them I've seen so far are not game-breaking(it actually crashed when I changed the graphics options the first time, but everything I changed worked after restarting the game and looked just as beautiful as it could).     EDIT: After having played through all the content already released, I can say that it really keeps up to the early expectations I had until you've finished. Another point that I really like about this game is that It has great replayability, mainly because of the dual-class system that allows you to have an incredible amount of build possibilities. I've played through the game about 5 times with different characters and it doesn't get boring at all.  The only thing I have a slight problem with is that in order to host a multiplayer game, you have to enable UPnP, but joining in open games works just fine.  EDIT 2 (initial non-beta release): Multiplayer should now work fine for everyone, the game is much more polished and has some really nice locations. The devotion system allows you to customize your builds even further and gives the game even more replay value and everything is a lot of fun right now.   I would like to have a list of pro's and con's, but that doesn't make sense without nitpicking, so here is what I like:  +the graphics are nice  +interesting characters  +good story  +good multiplayer  +REALLY satisfying sounds for beating up stuff   And the only minor nitpick: getting a specific item can sometimes take ages, but you can trade in multiplayer so it's really not that bad.

Spells and attacks got a real impact behind them, and the monsters die in satisfying manners. - Lots of character options. You start off by choosing 1 class, but later on you can combo with a second class. - Devotion is interesting. In the world you find shrines which requires you to either kill some monsters, or sacrifice some item, which gives you 1 devotion point. These points can be spent in a secondary skilltree (which is the same no matter what class you are), giving you lots of passive bonuses and skills that trigger of your skills. - Lots of varity in monsters. Dont get fooled by the first hour or so, where you fight bandits, zombies and skeletons mostly. It gets alot better further in. - Lots of optional quests. - Loot filter. You can set what the lowest quality of loot you want to show up. Its really needed in this lootfilled game. 99% of what drops is just tosh, not even worth selling after a certain point.  - you can teleport back to town anywhere, without limitation. You can also leave a portal up, so you can place one before a bossbattle for example so you can get back fast if you die.  Cons: - Awful mapsystem. You dont get any sort of indication where you need to go. A star appear on the minimap on your objective when you get close enough, but by that time you cant miss it. - The loot. There is lots of it. So much, that it devalues the whole loot aspect of the game. Suffers from the same as Diablo 3 did at launch. In addition there are waaaay to many stats on the items. You can go several levels without finding anything remotely useful for you, since every single damage type got its seperate % dmg modifier. - Poor explanaiton on each skill. Its very hard to tell what a skill does before you actually put a point in it and try it for yourself. The flavor text on the skills are much more detailed than the actual effect.  - The devotion tree is massive. Overwhelmingly so. Most of the passive skills give bonues to 1 particular dmg effect, so you need to mouse over every single one to find out which tree to invest in. A filter option would be appreciated. - Lore is poorly implemented. In an action game like this, you need to tell a story without forcing me to read walls of dialogtext, optional lorebooks you might find in random places, or reading what the faceless npcs has to say. - Needs a guide to play effectivly. Sooo much you can do wrong. Its a researching minmaxers dream though, so this might be a plus for you - The crafting. There are hundreds of different crafting parts.  TLDR:  A flawed game, but still one of the best in its genre atm, and most definetly worth the askingprice if you are into this kind of game.",

The areas seem much more polished\\real feeling (if not a little bit 'samey' at times) than Diablo 2 - not just big squares\\zones divided as if it is all tainted farmland.   The different classes are great - there is so much variety between them that it encourages multiple characters\\playthroughs.

This is a must play if you're a fan of dungeon crawler ARPGs, particularly Diablo 2 or Path of Exile.   Pros:   The class system is well thought out and not overly complicated, whilst being extremely flexible.     Satisfying sound and visual design. The sound effects are extremely satisfying when using abilities or attacking enemies, there's a weight to everthing you do and you really feel like you're doing damage. The level design is well thought out for the most part and the designs are gorgeous accompanied with a truly unnerving feeling of dread.    Only certain dungeons have randomly generated environments, so no spending precious time wandering around looking for the exit.    This game does not hold your hand or pull its punches, Ultimate difficulty can and will kick your a$$.   GD actually has PvP unlike a certain other ARPG.    Committed and friendly community. GD doesn't have a huge fanbase but players are committed, friendly and informative, there's always someone willing to answer your question or assist you.    Cons:   Game can be demanding, it's not as well optimized as say D3 and can be CPU intensive, turning down some settings, particularly shadows and AA should keep you stable however.    The game can be completed in single player but these sorts of games are best enjoyed with friends, it can be difficult finding players through the online system.    Crate did an outstanding job for such a small company, with consistent free updates to the game introducing new areas, more items, and of course balance changes as well as expansion DLC for additional content.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to love this game, I truly did. And, truth be told, I don't hate it. I've had a decent time with it so far - It doesn't have any noticeable bugs, it runs fine, and all of its systems perform just fine.  Caveat: Just fine. That's how I'd describe the game, and the reason I can't possibly recommend it.  See, Grim Dawn is a spiritual successor to Titan Quest, an ARPG released back in 2006 in the middle of a decade that was mostly dry of any such games. Since the release of Diablo 2 in 2000 and until the release of Torchlight in 2009 the only two RPGs of note were Titan Quest and Sacred 2 - And by when TQ released, even Sacred 2 was still way off. This meant that Titan Quest was basically the first 3D ARPG to actually be worth a damn, it did what it did well, and the setting helped it a lot. It was fun, it was nice, it was all a Diablo 2 fan could have wanted in an era where Blizzard refused to so much as acknowledge the existence of Diablo 3.  Fast forward a full decade and, well, we get Grim Dawn. The ancient mythology has been changed for a custom world because of the impossibility to obtain the rights to the IP, but the game itself is... Well, calling it a spiritual successor to TQ is quite a mouthful. It may as well be a Titan Quest reskin with just a few quality of life improvements and a much blander, generic setting. And that's a problem, because a lot of things have happened since 2006 for ARPGs, and while other games have moved on Grim Dawn feels very much stuck in 2006. It plays just like Titan Quest did back then, with barely any gameplay upgrades (The graphics do look better tho), and with a storyline that, well, I don't give a rat's ♥♥♥ about. Now, to make this a bit simpler, I'll explain how I feel about each of the elements in the game:  Graphics/Visual style: They're OK. I like the grim setting, but to be honest the whole thing looks rather generic, and I feel other games - Namely Path of Exile, which is free - have done this better. It's not an ugly game, not at all, but it just doesn't stand out when compared to other games of the same kind. Even Val Hensing's looks stand out, and of course if you're more into cartoonish looks you'll find Torchlight 2 or even Sacred 2 to be way better than this, because absolutely nothing stands out graphically here. Everything looks toned down and samey. Even Titan Quest had more of a characteristic look than this one, which means Grim Dawn is sort of a step backwards on that regard.  Gameplay: Plays exactly like Titan Quest did, down to the ability trees following the same formula. The few things that were added are rather small, like a faith system that gives you small bonuses, and the reputation part of the game was much better done by the Val Hensing series. Honestly, if what you want is a game that you can play in tons of ways where classes feel fully different, you could go with Diablo 3 or Sacred 2. If what you want is customization, then Path of Exile does much better, for free. If what you want is average gameplay, Van Helsing will do it better than this one, with better graphics and storyline.  Storyline/Worldbuilding: May as well not exist. I mean, it IS there but... yeah, no reason to care. Titan Quest had me caring because I knew of the setting beforehand - of course traversing the Styx meant something, because your average player had read about it in myths long before the game came around. The storyline and worldbuilding in Grim Dawn are samey, repetitive, and don't quite stand out. ARPGs aren't known for having deep stories, and some like Diablo 3 have downright terrible ones, but in this one there is just no reason to care. Van Helsing did a great job at giving you a story. Path of Exile gave your character a reason to do what he or she did. Sacred 2 also threw you into a storyline that was easy to understand right away. This one does neither.  But perhaps the worst part in Grim Dawn is that the game simply has no charm at all. There's no identity to be found, where all other exponents of the genre have one. I found myself longing to get the witty comments of my ghost companion from VH while playing this, or hearing snark from the player character like in Sacred 2, or even the horrible one-liners from Diablo 3 that should have seen its writers sent to jail. But I got nothing, nothing at all. There's nothing in place to make the game fun beyond killing monsters in complete silence with a background track and monster sounds. There's no interaction whatsoever, whatever characters there are are paper-thin and the world doesn't really have much that stands out and pikes your curiosity.  So it is based on all these things that I just can't recommend Grim Dawn. I'll keep playing the game, and it is moderately fun, but in the end my review comes down to one thing: Should I recommend this game to people looking for a good ARPG, when there's so much better out there?  The answer is no, I shouldn't. Because the game is at best average and at worst anchored to a decade that's gone. There's better out there, and while I'm sure most will enjoy this, you'll likely enjoy this game's main competitors more - and you can find those at a fraction of the price, or for free, if you know where and when to look for them. Skip this unless you absolutely felt Titan Quest was the epitome of an ARPG and don't want absolutely any changes on the formula, because for all the things this game does reasonably well it just doesn't advance the genre at all, when other titles since 2006 have done so.",

After that it felt pointless to play it anymore. I finished the game in veteran mode - that was the highest difficulty option available as a new player, and it felt waaaay too easy. The game also has several very annoying flaws.  - Kick a tree - you just recieved a health potion. Look at the sky - another health potion is added to your inventory. Kill a mob - twenty health potions that are all imba are added to your inventory. You _never_ run out and fear for your life. Never ever ever.  - The mobs level up many places, just as you level up. So you got stronger and they got stronger. Zzzzz. Sure creatures in the early game are weak if you return to those areas, but it just makes the game feel so 'scripted' when they enemies are always a tiny but around your level.  - The exact same repetitive missions done at the bounty table. They do not differ in any way. - A terrible map and highlight system, that doesn't allow the player to mark down interesting places that can't be visited yet. For instance if you have no dynamite. If there is one, it's certainly hidden very well. I can't count how many times I was frustrated with the map not highlighting a portal either, or a shrine, until I was practiaclly 20-50 meters away from it, making the local map more or less pointless. Why would the stuff added to a map even disappear in the first place, that makes zero sense.  - You never fear for your life, and the penalty from dying is miniscule. Without a consequence it's very hard to truly care. - Lack of quest stars! I had scenary hiding an NPC and couldn't tell that I was supposed to talk to that NPC to finish my quest. The minimap shows nothing.  - Certain portals are located at terrible places.  - A ridicilous drop rate! The map is littered with items, and I felt it was way more hack and slash than Diablo 2. Now compare this to Baldur's Gate 2, where good items are much more precious and hard to come by, and one is actually excited to compare new loot to the equiptment you are already carrying.  - A weird map editor/game engine. Mobs will shoot you through the walls, if you walk against a wall you can hit enemies on the other side, and some of your spells can penetrate walls. Other times you can't throw your bomb over the edge, which makes very little sense.  - A terrible AI. All the enemies are standing still on the map, just waiting for you to come by. Then they rush the player and that's the game AI. They have made certain enemies attack each other, but you are always overpowered and do not care about it, and never think 'they are fighting aganist each other - now is my chance!'. There is no personality connected to the mobs - you never face anything out of the ordinary. You do face a few NPCs that you can take to camp, and a few lying NPCs, but despite a warning message in the text about doing so, none of them buthered anyone in my camp, or caused any problems, and the lying NPCs were easy to figure out.  - Other stuff I forgot.  It's a good indie game and that's what it is. An indie game. I feel the rating is way too high. For easy and mindless hack and slash, sure. For an action RPG. Check out the competion before you buy it.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I bought this game during the Steam Summer Picnic 2016 sale. It looked fantastic and offered full controller support. I really like top-down games like Van Helsing, Gauntlet, Victor Vran, and this was a natural addition to my collection of that type of game.  But... it doesn't work for me. I use a controller only setup, in my living room, on my TV. My PC boots into steam.exe as the shell, no Windows overhead. I don't use a mouse and keyboard at all unless absolutely necessary, and never for games. This game, while claiming 'full controller support', doesn't let you even navigate the menu with the controller. You have to use the mouse to click. Not to mention there were bugs in the main menu before even starting the game. If you click on 'new character', nothing happens until you open the options screen, make a change, and then close out of it. Then the character would appear. The character looked absolutely awful, by the way. The model looked like a bad 2004 WoW clone. I gave it a whirl anyway, the story cutscene at the beginning was great, but then gameplay started and I couldn't interact with the first guy. I could run around using a controller, and I could attack, but attacking would automatically lock onto random things so my character would suddenly run towards a fence post and begin attacking it, instead of attacking the space in front of him like he should have. So not a single button worked to interact with the quest giver. I had to get off my couch, and go click on the guy. That's when I ALT-F4'd and requested a refund.  If you play with mouse and keyboard like a PC master race f***man, and don't mind the crappy character models, this game is for you. Else, it's not.",

            "review_text": "Is this a good game? I dont know. It certainly has the potential for it, but beneath the shiny exterior lies calculations after calculations. See the game isn't really hard, if you follow the right path. While you would think that picking up a weapon would be easy to do, in reality it's another game in itself. It's because all the modifiers, 16 in total, I mean really. So you pick up a weapon, with lots of damage, but ooh wait it has 10% physical turns into vitality, plus poison damage. Then I cant use that weapon with my current skill set. That's not a good system. I can accept that lightning skills can have an electrocute effect and that lightning damage% + could help strengthen it, but it's on a seperate modifier. And to make it worse, it doesn't stop there, cause the same thing applies to resistance!  Is it a good game?, I dont know. It's one of the few games that I had to pause the game and figure out my skills path. That said, the game has three skilltrees... Plus skills granted from gear and augments. In the end, if you want to play this game, be ready to stop and think for a while, cause you'll hit that roadblock where you dont know if you're on the right path and probably end up looking for guides on youtube and such.  So for now I cant recommend this game to the majority.   Edit:  To add to this, yes I enjoy D3 more and I dont enjoy PoE. And it's not because of the choppy animations and slower pace, it's just annoying to have to double-check every item and augment in the game like this. Maybe the game needs an overhaul on the dual-spec + devotion system. And changing the damage system badly, I mean what is the big difference between trauma and bleed damage? It's not that it doesn't make sense, but it just adds layers of unecessary complexity. Simplify it, make a smaller cluster♥♥♥♥ of numbers and values that needs to be calculated. 'an attack does 8 fire damage and 8 burn damage over 5 seconds' to 'an attack does 8 fire damage and 8 fire damage over 5 seconds'. Just a little more streamline, less modifiers.",

As a big fan of Titans Quest (I beat the game on all difficulties with multiple classes and took down the Hydra), I really wish I could recommend this game to people but in all honestly, I can’t. If you are type of player who enjoys grinding / farming repeatedly and you “do the math” to calculate the optimal build (class / skill selection) you might love this game. Otherwise you will probably wish you didn’t waste your time.  The biggest issues with the games can be summed up by scaling, mobs and just plain stupid ideas.  Scaling – Most enemies will always be 3+ levels higher than you and some bosses will be 8+ levels higher than you on normal difficulty. This is absolutely unnecessary, the base scaling would be better if enemies were your level with bosses a couple (i.e. 2) levels higher. The scaling could increase with veteran mode and play though.  Mobs – Up ahead you see a group of enemies, as you approach another group materializes behind you and you are surrounded. Happens all the time, so boring. The only real question is, how many waves are going to materialize behind you. And don’t forget, a lot of the bosses will also endlessly summon reinforcements.  Stupid ideas - The intersection of bosses, endless mobs and AOE damage. Some of the bosses will require you to fight waves of fodder while trying to navigate in a confined space covered in AOE damage - All of this to try and get a swing or 2 at the boss (which you will probably miss since he is 8 levels higher than you).   - Probably the stupidest idea I have seen in any game yet is the skeleton key for Descent into torment. You beat the boss, you get a key (and recipe) to open the door to the next 2 dungeon levels. The doors close behind you so if you die you need a new key. Except if you die, craft the key and go back the doors still don’t open. You actually have to quit out of the instance restart the game, go through the 3 levels again (kill boss again) and then use your crafted key. Nothing in the game will tell you that you need to quit, I found that out via the forums when I was looking for how to submit a defect. Oh, and there is a room on the 4th floor of the dungeon known as the “death room”  Now you might be like, hey that sounds like fun; if I do my build correctly, I can frustrate myself for hours. Well, here is where even the diehards are complaining - The selection of viable builds is limited and people are apparently changing their builds around equipment drops (really, you thought that was a good idea, so disconnected from reality).  People should be able to pick any class, any build and be able to proceed their way through normal difficulty. The next 2 play throughs are for the die hards.   Enjoy my $20 something bucks, you earned it for Titans Quest.",

The bad: they're full of arbitrary road blocks, so you often have to backtrack alot to reach a point that is 10 ft in front of you. Backtracking is fun!  - the Hud. Rendered into the viewport, so you have less FoV when moving to the bottom of the screen. You can rotate the camera, another good thing, the bad, you pretty much have to rotate the camera every 10 steps or risk being OHK'ed by some chargers. You're not only fighting mobs, you're also fighting the camera.  - Should you know the 'one more centaur and I seriously cry' feeling from TQ: welcome back. For the non initiated: too many trash mobs.  - 3 weeks after release they have nothing better to do then pull out the nerf stick and hit the game really hard. In it's current state (stability) balancing is certainly not the most pressing issue. The build diversity wasn't as compelling as TQ in the first place, now it's even more narrowed down.

However, you might be confused about where to go, as I found it very annoying there's no direction leading you to your mission destination on the point.

This game is still attrative but repeating at the same time. Anyway, had fun playing, and it's certainly not bad for an indie developer.",

After a successful kickstarter and an equally successful time in Early Access, the spritual successor to Titan Quest is a fantastic addition to the ARPG landscape.    Grim Dawn throws you into the apocalypic world of Carn. Only moments after an aeterial was exercised from your body, you have to start exploring/surviving/doing jobs for people because 'you're expendable' in this world.  Classes in this game are forged from masteries which grant abilies, passives, and stat points for you to progress though the game. Now, you only can have two masteries on one character which makes life a lot of fun, or chaotic genius. Quick examples without links are a Blademaster (Soldier/Nightblade) that rarely autoattacks, a Warden (Soldier/Shaman) that rarely needs health potion due to regeneration, and a Warlock (Arcanist/Occultist) that drops meteors EVERYWHERE. That being said, these are potential builds.  This gets further complicated by the addition of the Devotion system. This system seems very similar to systems used in Path of Exiile, but is less complicated and limited to only 50 points, I could go into depth about what the system holds, but you need to look at it for yourself.  Now, for all those 'graphic' people, it looks beautiful though and through. The creatures have a grim feel to them, and you can feel each attack that they and your character lands. The detail on the models is pleasing and I can say calmly that everything has improved greatly as time has gone on, watching this title grown and grown over the course of its early access life. Admitantly, I'm pleased anyday of the week when a sudden crit goes off and shakes the screen with enough force to remind you the creature is now a bloody mist in front of you. Each ability looks refined and honed.  For people with concerns, there is more still coming to this game. A survival mode, and expansion, and more refinement to the title.  Crate games, you have done a brilliant job, and I look forward to seeing more from you.",

I won't say it's perfect though. The story is slightly above average at best (lots of lore snippets to be found though) and the ever present struggle with resistances in the hardest difficulty sometimes dampens the fun a bit. The world is very standard-fantasy-apocalypse-ish, though like I said very colorful and visually diverse.  All in all I can only recommend Grim Dawn and give it a thumbs up.

I could never really get into that game, and though this may have some similar features I definitely find it more satisfying. The world is deliciously dark and gritty. Loot has scaled up very nicely so far. The stats on items are interesting.  Many ease of use features (dps calculations, free town portals etc.) Unique types of items from certain enemy types (like spectral from ghosts.) Many secret areas (very rewarding to find.) I could go on, but to keep things concise: the features you expect from an arpg are featured well.   Cons list is pretty short so far. Some of the abilities could do with a bit more clarifcation on weapon or damage types (like how some of the fighter tree skills affect ranged weapons, or where the %fire damage is going.) There's an extra layer of bonuses that you get from unlocking shrines, and it can be a bit overwhelming navigating your way through the bonus tree. Pretty minor gripes.",

There are some cool things in this game, you can combine two classes at level 10 but then you still have to spend a lot of points to be able to unlock the skills you want. So you don't know if you will like you class by level 30ish. With each level you can add some points to attributes, but spending them in your class bar that unlocks skills also raises your stats so it feels a little redundant.   There is a reputation system that rewards you with being able to buy high end gear and equipment upgrades that add damage etc. This goes paired with the many items that you can use to augment weapons, so you can end up with a weapon that is upgraded twice.   Constitution is a gold/yellow bar on top of your health, when you are out of combat your health goes up and consumes constitution in order to regenerate. You can refill it by finding meals in the world (no inventory items for eating). But this mechanic seems a little slapped in there for good measure and never really feels like it adds that much to gameplay overall.  There are also shrines you can restore for points to spent in a passive skill tree with constellations that contain different upgrades and abilities that you can put on top of the abilities that you have already learned.   Grim Dawn tries to differentiate itself from other ARPG's but doesn't really stand out that much from the standard ARPG gameplay. It is however a lot more casual than Path of Exile for example, which is pretty hardcore, and because of this it is also a lot more fun to play just a few hours of whenever you feel like it.

It has all the elements that made the original Titan Quest series great, but now it looks a lot better, with richer animations, better combat than most ARPGs out there (only worse than Diablo 3's and pretty on par with Torchlight 2's, both pretty good ARPGs too, with their ups and downs, of course).  This game looks grim, indeed, the world is not a fairy tale full with heroes with amazing powers, everything looks depraved and decayed, our own character is a no one, strange circumstances have put us, the player, on a very difficult situation and we must prove ourselves that we can be of some worth in this world Grim Dawn has to offer, while we keep uncovering the mysteries around what has been done to us, as we saw in the introductory cinematic.  What makes this game interesting, compared to other similar titles, is that everything seems to be well crafted, with a lot of love put into every aspect of the game from the developers, it feels like a true RPG, combat can be a bit simple (similar to Path of Exile's combat here, maybe), and each character 'class' or spec seems to have several variants to play around with, so if you like to experiment with different builds, this game is nice on that aspect.  The game also has mod support, I've seen some interesting mods out there already, and I'll try them in the future since, much like with Torchlight 2, I think this game will become even more awesome with a couple big mods installed, and it seems to be the case right now already.  On the negative side, I'd say the game engine could have been a bit more optimized in the sense that the game will only use one of our CPU cores at max, then not much of the rest, so it's hard to get like 144 FPS constantly and you can expect some FPS drops on intense combat situations too, because of this. With an i5 4690K and a GTX 1070 I can play at 110+ FPS reaching 144 at times (on a 144 Hz, VSYNC enabled and everything maxxed, 1080p), but I can see some frame rate drops to the 70s sometimes in heave combat scenarios, because of the CPU limitation within the engine itself, so keep this in mind; I also tested the game on a GTX 770 like 6 months ago and I could easily sustain 70+ FPS everything maxxed, so don't worry about GPU performance, because it’s the CPU the one that limits your average frame rate here.  Overall, I see this game will be still getting free upgrades and DLCs, and that’s awesome too, and I can see myself playing this game as much as I've played other ARPGs like Torchlight 2 or PoE if they keep adding content. I assume it must be even better with friends, but I haven't tried the multiplayer yet.  For the price, this game's a must for ARPG fans that like their games gritty and dark, with a good amount of exploration, freedom and even secret places and quests to find, so give it a go if you're looking for an action RPG.",

It has a good variety in the skills and in the combination with the Devotion system and minor enchantments you can add to weapons and equipment, there is what feels like a really large variety of characters you might want to build. On top of that, you can also dual-class with no actual drawbacks.  If I had anything to complain about the game, it is that the small budget and tiny team has definitely impacted the visual design. The enemies are designed so that they're good looking as a standalone, but they merge fairly easily with the environment so the overall feel is slightly muddy and not very crisp.

If you can pick this game up while it's on sale, by all means try it. If you enjoyed dungeon crawlers such as Diablo, then you're sure to love this game. The gearing system in this game is quite extensive. Overall a good game. Not the best, but certainly deserves kudos for the overall developement. 3.5/5 rating.",

            "review_text": "Slightly more polished Titan Quest. Good game for 100 hours gameplay, Past that mark you will either have to fall in love with the game or you will stop playing.  I find problematic the fact of fixed layout for zones with randomly placed road blocks which makes you choose other path from time to time. But otherwise it's still the same. Going trhough 3 dificulties becomes kinda borring. I guess it is a price for more polished graphics and posibility to rotate camera.  Another thing i don't like is the itemization. Probably too many stats to my taste (was also in TQ). Charbound / soulbound items and crafting mats is also pretty annoying, which made me give up on re-leveling new char again, because of reputation reset and crafting mats reset.  Also i don't like speed cap and mob lvl scaling.  But there is hope, because mods can actually fix a lot of things i don't like. Except the necesity to go through game 2 times to unlock ultimate. Useless skills will get eventually modified which will increase limited build variety. But it will require quite a lot of time and active modding scene. So far it is 2 weeks since release of the toolkit, there are already some decent mods outhere, but there is potential for bigger overhaul.   Summary Pros  - great graphics  - different game pace compared to some other ARPGs on the market  - 1st playthough (50-100 hours)  - modding scene  Cons  - fixed layouts  - 3 difficulties you have to go though  - soulbound items and crafting mats  - many 'useless' skills and stats with weird itemization and invisible effect  Despite the many things i don't like, i find Grim Dawn to be a great game for 25€. After some time there might be even bigger reason to pick up Grim Dawn because of the modding comunity.",

            "review_text": "As a long time ARPG fan, this is an excellent game. I was vaguely aware of it through it's extended alpha and beta test phases, but I hadn't heard any specifics until recently. The environment reminds me a lot of Path of Exile, which is great. It's gritty and dark, and you get a real sense of the survivalist mentality of everyone you come across. Where this game pulls ahead of PoE though (in my opinion) is the story. Path of Exile sets a great mood with a rich environment, but it doesn't really expand on it. Grim Dawn has tons of little lore snippets hidden through the world, with little random happenings that draw you in in a way that PoE never did.   This game is also challenging, but it's a gradually occurring challenge. To me, where Path of Exile really flopped was the building up of difficulty. You would finish act 3 and go into act 4 and suddenly you're just getting absolutely smacked around for no real reason, and it doesn't make much sense. GD slowly builds and builds and builds, the way it should be. It doesn't feel like any one step is TOO much of a leap from the previous on, until you turn around and look back at where you started.   As I said, this is all strictly my opinion, of course. I want it understood that I do still enjoy Path of Exile, but I feel like Grim Dawn is the better game. PoE can be extremely overwhelming to new players, even veterans of isometric ARPGs like myself. Grim Dawn is complex, but in a way that doesn't throw eleventy hundred choices at you at once going 'ALRIGHT TIME TO PICK NOW, CHUCKLES.' I like that. I also like that it doesn't penalyze you TOO harshly for doing things 'wrong.' In PoE if you build your character wrong, you might as well delete it and reroll, and that's just time consuming as hell. In GD you can respec your character almost completely, without having to delete. Of course, changing classes will still require a new character, and you CAN screw up badly enough (if you over-invest in Masteries) that you might need to reroll, but it's far less punitive than PoE.  All in all, Grim Dawn offers a Path of Exile-ish experience, throwing the entire Encyclopedia Britannica as it's instruction manual, then just telling you better have the first half memorized by the time you hit act 4. It's much more beginner friendly, but that doesn't make it easy by any means. Well worth the $25 sticker price. thumbs up.",

Someone has yet to come up with great story mission ideas outside of killing this thing or collecting this item by killing this other guy. If you know this going in because that has always been the nature of ARPG and loot quests, then you will love every minute of it, even dying.

Spoilers btw.   Grim Dawn was something I had in my wishlist for quite some time - since the game was still considered to be Early Access in fact. It was only recently that I had found myself playing hours upon hours dedicated to a single ARPG. I strongly feel like the developers of Crate Entertainment didn't just make a game, but instead wrote a love letter to those who've appreciated classic ARPGs such as Diablo 2 and Titan Quest. Grim Dawn captures the aesthetic of a somber, wicked world that puts you in the spotlight of it all. The plot is centered around an ongoing epidemic with Aetherials, Chthonians, Undead, and even a group of human enemies known as Cronley's Gang. The story starts with you about to be hung for being posessed by an Aetherial. In the middle of your lynching the Aetherial spirit nopes out of your body and Captain Shootygun McCree uses his amazing dexterity to High Noon the rope and save your life. You remember absolutely nothing, from here on it's a fresh slate. But that comes with some consequences. Due to your Aetherial posession, you have the ability to conjure up rift gates that majik people to other rift gates that you'll find around the landscape of Carin. People may not trust you - because to them, you're a demon; and you'll come across many people who are outright crazy - let me be the first to say, your decisions matter. Not end-game changing, but they matter.  Now I could go on about the gameplay features, and they're good too, don't get me wrong but I really want to talk about the story and underlying lore that hardly gets mentioned. Every once in a while you'll come across a note or a page from a journal or diary and you'll start to piece together the stories of some of the inhabitants of Carin. Whomever wrote these pages is absolutely fantastic. I've hunted down many of these and they really do highlight the kind of world you're in. One story told the tale of a son waiting for his father to come back but never does - we're assumed he's dead since the journal mentions his father being on a trip to the north, where the Aetherial invasion started. Another details the story of a family trying to head south but ends up being blocked off, their horse dies and the remaining survivors have to resort to cannibalistic tendancies to sate their ever lasting hunger. You start to realize exactly what you've been thrown into. And it's not pretty.  From a gameplay standpoint, I'd place it rather high. As it currently stands, there are the 35 quests that can be completed as well as the Crucible for you to tackle on. Character customization is rather lacking but build variety more than makes up for this. Without mods, there are 6 different classes - or as the game refers to them, as 'masteries' - and when you hit level 10 you then have the option to take on a second class to form quite a unique variety of play styles. Each mastery feels unique and fresh, and the skill trees are fleshed out to reflect and compliment the feel of the masteries very well. Do you wish to use pyrotechnics, grenades, and pistols to blow your enemies apart? Or perhaps you're one to use nature itself to rip your enemies to shreds? The options are in your hands, which I really do enjoy. My two main characters are a Pyromancer (Demolitionist + Occultist) and a Blademaster (Soldier + Nightblade) which I highly recommend you try out if you get the chance.  Loot is fun to acquire but there are plenty of times where I'm finding things I don't ever need and can sometimes result in my character being undergeared - not to say this is necessarily a bad thing however. When I find something that I can actually use to compliment my build it feels gratifying in its own right. With the addition of the Crucible you are rewarded with plenty of loot chests to give you plenty of tasty gear.   There is one thing I'm not a fan of - and that is, that in the current state of the game there is no form of transmog system in place. I know this is more of a Diablo/WoW thing but it can easily be adapted. The High-End gear looks good, it really does, but having that freedom to the player should be something in place.   All in all, I'm very pleased with Grim Dawn and am very looking forward to what Crate has in store for us in the near future. I'd give it an 8.5/10 in it's current state.",

The game is lacking polish in many areas, for a few examples, our games will crash every time my friend and I play multiplayer and try to exit after our session. This is after a long screen freeze and it's incredibly annoying. In the game; when I change my skills in the divinity screen, the old skill will still fire instead of the new one I've selected.

GD gives you a lot of freedom to experiment, and although it is possible to make a character which will struggle in certain aspects and against certain situations/enemies, you'll probably never really feel like your character can't progress. As long as you like the playstyle you built for, the game is a blast.",

So the new October Humble Bundle came, so I decided I'd buy a monthly subscription. The game you receive is Grim Dawn. At first I was very skeptical about it, but later, I decided I'd give it a try because of trading cards.  Well, this surely isn't what I expected! This game is way more cooler than I thought it would be. The story is quite interesting, atmosphere is awesome, graphics are cool and there's just so much you can do! There's cool classes and you can choose 2 of them, cool skills and a lot of gear options. A con is that all the enemies always attack the same. Also I wanted more zone variety, and more of them wouldn't hurt.  Overall my rating is 7/10.",

By extension, many skills are 1 point wonders or max it out type-thing.  The two factors combined makes it really hard to actually test out skills, because you need a ton of points to see how they function properly, and if you end up not liking the skill, you better find another skill at a similar class level to use or you have wasted build points there, which is kind of eh. Too much guess-and-check there really.   However I do find the game fun for what it is. If you want Diablo-esque gameplay with an interesting class mixing dynamic.  Is there a way to remove tags though? Because whoever decided that this thing has 'full controller support' is lying. Just tried out the controller support on it, and it's... atrocious. I can't figure out how to actually bind skills properly to the keys, and you have to switch to the mouse to mess around menus and stuff, which fully defeats the point.  ",

The music is very good and it's so well made that it plays among with the enviroment. Visuals are amazing, detailed world with a huge ammount of different enemies and all of them well designed.   The main plot is not the best thing but it's kinda common on these type of games (Almost everyone is lazy and you're the only one who does the stuff for them, yada yada yada) still, it IS a good story with memorable characters and it's side quests can give you a really nice background about the World of Cairn and what was before the Grim Dawn.   You should have this game on your library, it's price without a discount is even a bargain because this game will give you tons of time to play and the replay value on this game is beyond many other ARPGs out there.",

It's grittier, darker style hits where Diablo misses, in my opinion. The character builds are significantly deeper, and I find there are more ways to stay viable even without searching out the best and most popular builds online.  Some framerate lag, mostly because of the beautiful but ridiculous spell and weapon effects. (Especially when you play co-op, because then the screen is overloaded with it all)  A little frustration with game crashes, but they are sporadic.  I've recommended this game often, and will do so again!",

Path of Exile comes a close second to me, but GD calls to my deep nostalgia of skill points and customization. This game has multiple classes and allows you to use a second one at level 10.   Grim Dawn's story and lore play on elements of dispair in an apocalyptic Victorian setting. The weapons are often simple tools and salvage strapped together with belts. It follows a loot system extremely similar to Diablo with a small caveat of what you see is what you get, an enemy can only drop what it normally uses. So you can fight certain enemies to get their weapons, or variants of them with slightly different modifiers (monster infrequents).   The game has simple choices in dialog that affect quest rewards, usually immediately. You might save someone's life or simply ask for money and move on. The lore has many Gods and otherworldlies vying for the world of man at the same time. There's less of a true 'good' in it all. In Diablo for example, there's angels and demons, but in GD there's conflict of interest. The Cult of Cthon wants to kill humanity and bleed them dry to summon their Cthulu-like god, while the Aetherials are possessive spirits seeking hosts. Humanity stuck despairing the morning the doors flooded open, that morning of the Grim Dawn.",

The dual class system plus the entire devotion tree means that every character can be completely customized. I don't feel like I'm just playing one of a few cookie cutter characters. Especially considering the price, I highly recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "Grim Dawn is a Diablo-Clone hack and slash action adventure that will be very comfortable to anyone who is used to this genre. All the basic mechanics and gameplay are there without much deviation.  Graphics-wise, like it's title, this game has a much darker and grimer feel then Diablo 3 and feels closer to Diablo 2. Environments look appropriately apocalyptic and monster designs are very well made with few recycles. A little disappointing are the character models, but maybe I expected a bit more flair for a game in 2016.  Sound design is appropriately gothic and moody with very nice atmospheric effects. Music is a tad generic however and I didn't exactly pay close attention to any tunes that I particularly enjoyed. Voices for the NPCs aren't over-the-top but they are also aren't particularly memorable.  One thing to note, is that the game map is really huge. There is so much to explore that if you just rush headlong the main quest and finish everything, you will be missing out quite a few sub-quests with good rewards and experience. Take your time to explore every nook and cranny.  Speaking of quests, this game offers choices in how you can undertake or complete some quests. Example: If you were to act like an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and kill indiscriminately, some paths may be forever locked to you, while some others may open up. There isn't really a wrong or right choice, and the player can feel free to choose what he / she wishes. The only downside I can see is that you may miss out on some rewards that may be more to what you want.  Skilltrees for this game feels alot like the system in Titan Quest in that you can multiclass. Not surprising since most of the game developers used to work on that game. Almost anything other then character attribute points can be respec quite cheaply.  Downsides, this game is VERY STINGY with its loot. I played as a caster in the game, and after 40 hours, I got my first legendary loot, and .... its for a different class. Yes I know, thats what people normally call 'A Near Miss' but c'mon man. While playing, items that drop are usually of about 5-10 levels higher and is quite rare to find a significant upgrade that is close to your current level. Maybe i'm playing the game wrong, but as a caster, my focus is on DPS, and it is so rare to find an item that gives me good dps. Its always an item that has good side-attributes with Bad DPS, or a Good DPS item with below-average side-attributes.  From what I read in the forums, apparently the game encourages multiple alts with multiple playthroughs. So unless you are willing to invest hundreds and hundreds of hours in creating alts for farming, you would be disappointed in the quality of loot the game offers.  Another disappointing thing I encountered was the ending. Here I am having just defeated the final boss, and the next thing, I meet an NPC who congratulated me.....and then....Nothing. No end credit screen, no penguins dancing on the screen. Just a simple in-game quest NPC saying thanks and I continue with the game. Is it really that difficult and expensive to code a simple end credit screen? :\\  Overall Rating: 7.0 / 10 A very well made Diablo-Clone that will scratch the itch for anyone looking for a good hack-and-slash ARPG. Be forewarned that the game is quite stingy with its loot and if you really want to truly enjoy the game, expect to spend alot of time with lots of alts before you are rewarded for your efforts.",
