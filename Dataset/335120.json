            "review_text": "These days, even mere mortals are more than awesome enough to do everything in spectacular fashion. Take Skyrim for example, everybody needs your help, you always have the capabilities to solve every task, and within hours you become strong enough to singlehandedly kill dragons. Along with this unparalleled power, players enjoyed countless luxuries, such as dozens of quest indicators, as well as arrows that point out exactly where to go and who to talk to. Serpent in the Staglands takes an approach that gamers have either long forgotten, or never even knew existed.   You are the all-powerful Moon Lord, or were I should say. Someone or something has trapped you in the mortal realm. When you start off, all you're given are some directions, papers identifying you as a merchant, and the assistance of a few allies. Before long, you will face your first great adversary, a wolf. Starting off in this game reminds me of the first  Baldur's Gate . In that RPG, you started off at level 1, and even the weakest creatures led to life or death struggles. In the beginning of my adventure, I summoned an ethereal ally, and requested the help of a couple of others. Our party of four was no match for a few wolves.  We all need a little help sometimes, but this game won't provide any. Aside from the always handy ability to save anywhere , you're on your own. Actually, I take that back. You're also given a journal so you can jot down any and all notes. Yes, if you come across a quest, you should write it down along with all pertinent information, because you might forget. Another aspect to keep in mind is that alongside combat and magic skills, there are also certain talents you should be training. With up to five party members, there is room to specialize, so you'll want someone that can speak to nobles, another that will brew potions, the one guy who can understand old texts, and so on. As you explore the Staglands, you'll meet others willing to join your 'cause'. It's worth swapping allies around, as they can have better stats as well as mastery of different skill-sets. Failing to do this could have disastrous results.   Speaking of disastrous results, early on combat can be especially difficult. Like  Baldur's Gate , this game employs a 'real-time with pausing' system. By pressing the space bar, you can pause everything, giving you ample time to issue orders, prepare spells, and pray to the RNG deities. One of the main aspects where Serpent in the Staglands differentiates itself, is in the magic system. Spell-casting is infinite; you are not limited by points nor the need to rest and recharge. However, there is a charge time for everything, and most spells require that you maintain the cast, possibly for the duration of the battle. This simplifies things somewhat, since you can designate one of your party-members as 'the tank' and channel all of your healing and stat-boosting spells to them. However, just because it's easy to learn spells, won't make you effective casters. If the enemies are too strong, the spells will fail to do anything. In fact, I've seen some of my foes not even notice my presence, despite everyone in my party channeling curses at them.  You'll likely find yourself relying on physical combat. Each party-member is capable of learning several combat techniques, although only three can actually be used at a time. These arts of war 'proc' after so many swings of a sword or firings of a crossbow. With the right combination of party members and skills, you can do more damage as well as inflict numerous debilitating effects on your foes. In my play-through, I had two characters using shield-bash. This skill can knock enemies down for a couple seconds. There wasn't much the toughest enemy could do against this onslaught. All skills are strengthened via points incurred upon leveling up. As with AD&amp;D, level-ups are few and far between, so you have to make the most of them. By the time I completed the game, my level had barely crossed into the double-digits.   There are other methods for dealing with hostility. Traps can be set to damage as well as impede enemy forces. This is all but required for handling the dreaded crawlers, who can kill party-members in 1-2 hits. Most enemies can also be lured out with ranged weapons or curses, in case your party can only handle one at a time. Admittedly, I've also foregone the pleasantries and sought the first strike when dealing with some people. There are a few crowds of bandits who attack all at once after a short verbal exchange. Rather than get torn to pieces by archers, I lured everyone out one at a time with missile weapons of my own. It's a cheap method, but considering how heavily the odds are stacked in the game's favor...   Bringing up a party from nothing, and the growing pains that go along with it, is one of the more compelling aspects of this game. The story is mostly in the background, and you might find yourself stumbling over plot-important NPCs in unlikely places. Most of your vacation in the horrid Staglands, will be spent exploring, getting a feel for the world, and using your talents to find solutions for various side-quests. There is a strong element of non-linearity, and play-throughs can be pretty different from one another, depending on how you handle every situation. I've noticed that my lack of diplomacy and understanding of foreign languages has led to a number of closed-doors. There is a sizable population of natives inhabitating the peninsula, but if you can't speak their language, then it's just more enemies to do battle with.   Still, there are moments that I can only describe as 'lovingly obtuse'. Certain events will happen, and you'll get to thinking that there's more to the story, but nothing comes of it. It's difficult to explain without resorting to spoilers, but let's just say that not all threads will resolve in a suitable fashion. There are also a couple puzzles where you will struggle with game mechanics (such as placing objects on pressure-plates). It helps to pay attention to the notes you acquire. Keep in mind also that something can be useless in the area you acquire it, but could be relevant in a location several miles away. There are actually not that many conversations to be had in this game. Most of the settlers aren't interested in gossip, and the dialogue trees have few (if any) branches. Sometimes you just have to read between the lines, and maybe fill in the blanks with whatever sounds good. On the bright side, the dialogue is well-done, and the bits of world-building are nicely handled.  The one major problem I have with this game is all the time spent staring at a loading screen. This can be especially grating early on, due to all the reloads caused by exceptionally squishy party-members. Serpent in The Staglands is also shockingly resource-heavy. The pixel-graphics have their charm, but there's nothing here that should demand such a large chunk of my PC's power. On the bright side, my adventure in the Staglands was mostly bug-free, with disappearing guards during some quicksaving shenanigans being the only outlier.   While not without its faults, Serpent in the Staglands is an ambitious and engrossing RPG. Considering that it was developed by two people, I'm rather surprised it turned out as well as it did. The main quest is on the shorter side, but there are a number of ways to play through the game, and there's plenty of freedom in terms of character builds and party organization. An expansion is currently in-development, so fans can expect to see more of Vol eventually. All in all, this is a worthwhile title for genre veterans as well as players who tire of having everything handed to them.

            "review_text": "Made by a two person team for gamers longing for the normal difficulty of the old school without window dressing or streamlining. You will experience TPKs, lost your way, explore around, encounter puzzles which may or may not have clues. Thankfully red herrings are rare and you won't end up lugging 100 keys/items which you won't have any idea what to do with. Major patching should be complete so now it's just balancing and bug fixes. Try your hand at a real old school crpg and see if your blade's still sharp and your mind agile enough.",

            "review_text": "*note - time played is not representative, I've been playing a lot offline on my laptop due to crappy hotel internet.  This game is a love letter to 1990s rpgs, doesn't hold your hand, and as such fully immerses you in its world and story. If you loved Fallout, you'll appreciate this game. It treats you like an intelligent human being, capable of reasoning and deduction. As such it's a rarity, and a valuable one.   Explore, experiment, put together clues and experience the satisfaction of having accomplished something without the game leading you by the nose to it. Pore over hand drawn in game maps, recovered diaries, stolen missives; research ancient tomes; talk to animals, attempt to understand the hostile natives - or show them the diplomacy of the sword. Wonder who to trust, or who to avoid, or who to kill. Build your character, and others, with a classless system that has over 100 stats, skills, spells, and aptitudes that allow for unique builds. Wander an entire peninsula as an outcast God, trying to find his way home, while trying to discover the identities and motivations of his enemies.   When's the last time you've been able to say any of the above about a crpg?   You're not going to like this is you have come to rely on quest logs, objective compasses, and expect an RPG to allow you to 'romance' (ugh) your party members. You're not going to like it if you expect an RPG to have a third person over the shoulder view or if you don't like reading in your computer games.   But you will cherish it if, like me, you can remember marathon pnp rpg sessions where it felt like an entire world was out there, waiting to be discovered, and you were only limited by your own intelligence and imagination",

            "review_text": "Did you ever find yourself playing Baldur's Gate and think to yourself, 'Boy I wish one of these low level bandits could wipe half my party.' Then congratulations you've found the game for you! While I don't have many hours in it, and admittedly I'm not very far, the quality is still very apparent. This game sidesteps Baldur's Gate's issue of casts per day, as per the DnD core rules by simply making the spells all channeled and certain equipment can increase or decrease the cast time for each of these spells. This game also has it's own combat skills for the sword and board types to engage the more melee centric players/characters. This healthy amount of skills compensates it's smaller and more basic weapon selection. It's biggest fault however is it's difficulty. Not that it is too hard, but instead that frequent deaths cause lots of staring at loading screens, and these loading screens can take a minute or two. This doesn't sound like much, but when you take into account that a single bandit can kill 2 early game party members on their own, it can be quite frustrating. My two cents though? Stick with it! If you're a fan of CRPG's this game is excellent and I'd easily reccommend it to any fan of the genre. Perhaps I'll edit this more as I get further in the game. Good luck Moon Lord, and trust no one...",

            "review_text": "Wow some people are unaware of what RPGs used to be like. Everything you heard about it's old schoolieness is 100% accurate, but cool features like the incantation book and a quest journal you need to fill out yourself really immerses you in the world the devs have created. Unfortunately, there are multiple bugs, more than I can count and nearly all of them reoccuring on a regular basis, but it seems all the truly gamebreaking ones have been fixed. This game is worth the $20 even if you plan on playing through only once, but I recommend going back and seeing exactly how different thing could have worked out (metaknowledge is a real thing in this game, btw). If this game ever goes on sale I'd say it's a must buy.",

The puzzles and amount of hidden stuff can feel like a chore at times. If you like puzzles you'll love SitS.  Don't expect any type of quest log or journal to help you out with questing. You'll need to READ a lot and WRITE things down.  Pros++ ++Puzzles ++Old School ++No hand holding ++Graphics / Art ++Lore / Story ( the story kind of feels unfinished ) ++Interesting Companions ++Prema death for Companions ++You can KILL EVERYONE! ++You'll die, alot.  ++I didn't crash once  Cons-- --It kind of just 'ends' on you. --Few sidequests --RNG god hates you. --Ton of spells, most are useless. --Females use the same body model in-game as Males..  --Load times --RNG god still hates you.  I recommend Serpent of the Staglands, if you are looking for a old school rpg full of puzzles and great lore. If you can find it a little cheaper than 19.99$, grab it.",

Serpent in the staglands is relative to most top down Rpg's in that era when the Genre was very popular. but this is unlike those Rpgs this particular Rpg is what they are sappose to be ....Difficult and immersive without a well thought out plan and a reaction for every action in this game you will find you and your party dead in every way possible in the game dont take this title lightly...you are in for a true Rpg experience the trading sytem is a good addition as well. you dont just have the title of spice trader you live it along with managing your party and everything else that comes with that you also need to watch your trade routes and stay updated on whats going on with your routes so nothing happens to your income. but theres more to this game than just two features you must pick it up and try it yourself. the in game journal is very impressive and editable in my opinion and the notes YOU create can be changed at anytime and trust me DO NOT take a step in this game unless you at least understand how that journal works because it helps with the immersion and Quest tracking because this game has no automatic quest tracking...its all on you so if you enjoy a Truly immersive Rpg and story this is the game for you otherwise stay away from it until you feel youve got at least the basic mechanics and features of the game figured out. as a side note someone good at titles as rare as this needs to do a very in depth letsplay I would watch it, this game will have you getting pretty serious at times which just makes it all the better.",

The setting, the atmosphere, the overall old school, 'hardcore' gameplay vision is what I crave. But it just falls flat on it's face by not being mechanically competent.Take the old Baldurs Gate, make it even harder to tell whats going on in the heat of battle, by making the battle log scream by on the side of the screen, and graphically muddling things together. ♥♥♥♥ up the difficulty scaling. Make the path finding a bit more clunky. Scrap quest tracking and replace with an ingame notepad. Multiply (yes) the loading times. Innovate some gameplay mechanics but make no effort to explain it to the player (knowing how obtuse the game was, I started by reading the entire online manual, and I was still struggling).  The two people who made this game clearly put in a huge amount of effort. The game is a love child, and I really want to like it, but its ultimately just a bit too annyoing to play. I really like what they are aiming for, but the mechanics and overall gameplay experience just doesn't do the vision justice. It's close, but right now I wish it had taken under an hour to get a feel for the game because I know I'm not going to be able to play it.",
