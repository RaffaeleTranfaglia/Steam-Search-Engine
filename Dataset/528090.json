            "review_text": "I'm not sure why so many people dislike this game. It actually is quite fun. At first, it is a little difficult, as the recipes are a bit cryptic, but once you start getting a few of the ingredients and see what they are, then it is pretty straight forward. Also, one person commented that they don't know how to shoot the bow. Actually, it is in the tutorial, so maybe that person didn't complete it or know how to read.   I've played both Summer and Winter, beat all the bosses, and have nearly all the achievements. The only thing I can't figure out is how to Tame a Bull. Other than that, it is pretty fun. I got it with a coupon for crafting a badge, so it was dirt cheap (less than a dollar).  If you like survival games, it is worth checking out.",
