            "review_text": "DO NOT PLAY. This is a Heroes of Might and Magic ripoff that is Pay To Win. The best exchange rate for this game is the Mountain of Diamonds costing $100 for 7500 Diamonds. You basically enter a portal with your troops, kill monsters, collect resources and level up. Rinse and repeat. The publisher JED Games just suck.  PROS 1. Similar to Heroes of Might and Magic That's the best thing I can think of.  CONS 1. List of items that use cash a. Unit Cards To buy the ultimate Fire type unit which is called a Hellhound. You need 1518000 gold, 1138 Diamonds and a minimum level 19.   b. Spells You need to spend Diamonds to buy mana, to buy new spells and to upgrade your spells. The best spell is Lightning costing 1296000 gold, 972 Diamonds and a minimum level 30.  c. Resources Mana, gold, wood, ore, gems and crystals can all be bought for Diamonds. You can even buy resources like gold at a rate of 1 Diamond to 1000 gold.  2. Charges on cards To further emphasize the Pay To Win system, if you buy a unit card, it will come with charges. Each time your unit dies, 1 charge will disappear. If all the charges are gone, the unit card disappears. The only ones that are immune to cards are your first 3 starter cards.  3. Premium Pass 30 days of Premium Pass for 500 Diamonds ($10.00)  100% at Battle Start, no mana well required x2 chance to get a new card x2 resource from mines and battles x2 experience points from battles x2 chance to get a more powerful artefact x10 action points recovery speed ",
