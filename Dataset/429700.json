The main thing about this game is well.... complete each level by collecting the pieces of Crystal it may sound easy but its not. The Game requires you to use your brain or else you will end up DEAD like no joke DEAD because One of your little guy dies so does the other one so think of how you can get both pieces without dying  I will say this game not good in terms of graphics but who am to judge as long you have fun thats the main thing.  and well the music is pretty good I will give that  Overrall I rate this game 7/10 it can be addicting so yeah :D  Would say the price is a little much but if you want an addicting game and rage at times then by all means buy this game",

The idea has been done before but this game seems to do it right. The only problem I see is that the audio makes my speakers sound blown. The game play is smooth and the controls (no game pad support yet) are smooth as well. Levels keep getting harder and harder so if you don't like rage inducing difficult puzzles this game isn't for you. 9/10 would kill my other self again.",
