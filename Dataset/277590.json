            "review_text": "Freedom Cry is a bit of stand-alone DLC for AC4. You play as Adewale, your ship Quartermaster from AC4 turned Assassin. Who sets out on a quest of his own to liberate slaves in the Carribean.  Freedom Cry does a lot to try and be different than AC4. For starters the game is more stealth focused. For much of the game you're liberating slaves from plantations by eliminating their overseers. And the player gets rewarded with new tools, upgrades and weapons for freeing more slaves. However if the player caught they begin to murder the slaves before you can free them. This creates an incentive to play as stealthily as possible and as a result there's significantly less of a combat focus. This was clearly intentional and you tend to only use your blowgun and hidden blades.  As a result Freedom Cry feels significantly more like a stealth action game than any of the previous Assassin Creed games. And it's to it's credit. The only real gripes I have with it are the story is a bit lacking compared to AC4 and it doesn't take you that long to complete. It is priced pretty reasonably though and it's a blast to try and complete 100%.  I highly recommend Freedom Cry. It complements AC4 nicely, and its more focused stealth gameplay is a welcome change.",

It makes some missteps and feels a bit tone deaf at times, but ultimately I think it does an admirable job of incorporating some very serious issues into a game. Just be wary of the short length, it's like one or two areas from AC4 with very little to do in them once you complete the story.",

As with other Assassin's Creed games this one introduces a new character (though Adewale is introduced in ACIV: Black Flag) with a unique Assassins vs. Templars storyline. If you held off on buying ACIV: Black Flag as I did then this game will offer insight into what you are missing. It is the same classic Assassin's Creed formula that makes the series fun with new location, improved visuals and continues the Assassin's fight for a noble cause.  I highly recommend it!",

If you see this go on sale (as it should be every sale season) by all means buy it, even for a friend if your trying to convince someone to give it a try. if youve been thinking about this series for some time now you wont be dissapointed.   To anyone who is new to this series and wants to keep playing more: After completeing and enjoying Assassins Creed: Freedom Cry, you could follow it up any one of the AC games that takes place within 100 years of this, with Black Flag being the most similar. Or go back to basics with the original assassins creed and AC:II through AC: Revelations  the only downside to this purchase that I can think of is that even if its stand alone, it is still DLC. being so, there arent too many tutorials to any mechanics that werent introduced in this add on. you may consider playing this while you have an Assassins Creed fan that you can talk to",

You need to have some experience in AC4 though, because no one explains any controls to you.",

As a result of the short story (only 9 missions) the characters we are introduced to have little to no characterisation which is a shame, as they were some rather interesting characters. I also enjoyed the closure of what happened to the Jackdaw and playing through Adewale's eyes, one of the best characters from Black Flag. Longer cutscenes or more missions to flesh out the character would have turned this from a good dlc to an amazing one.",

            "review_text": "This review is for those who actually have played Assassins Creed Black Flag. If you do not have it I suggest you buy it at a sale because the main game will be cheaper than the dlc since the price is only slightly higher but the overall content is more aswell.  I own Assassins Creed on XBox 360 and the game simply is breathtaking with the easy to learn gameplay, the open world features and the good and atmospheric music. The story however was a little short and Freedom Cry as a dlc is of course even shorter. Most players suggest an average gametime of only 4-6 hours. However it took me about 20 Hours to discover all the places unlock everything and tried the minigames like fishing. (They are the same as in Black Flag though)  Adewale has his own combat style and uses a machete. Like Kennway he can use firearms, ropedarts, poisoned darts etc. The overall gameplay is the same as in Black Flag but the story is set 20 years later. (I wont say much about it since i dont want to spoiler and it depends on your taste if you will enjoy it or not).  The map is not very big, i am guessing less than 25% of Black Flags overall map but the locations have their own appearance and are detailed.  I did not encounter any notable bugs but I was a bit dissappointed that Adewales ship is a repainted Jackdaw. The ship however cannot be upgraded as much as the Jackdaw.  A new element in the game is as already mentioned Adewales own combat style and the ability to free slaves either by boarding slave ships or by killing the overseers at the plantations. Some of the overseers have become very hostile and will attack you instantly. If you are spotted on the plantations, the overseers are going to kill your maroonfellows so you should really take care. The plantations sooner or later always get new owners so you can replay this part. The game also can be continued after the story has come to an end just like in Black Flag.  If you enjoyed Black Flag and want some more story related content or discover some more West Indies locations I really recommend this but dont expect a lot of new content. Also keep an eye out for a decent sale, I suggest maybe 3-5 dollars is a good price.",

No tutorials is fine if this were DLC, as orginally that's what this game was, but if you intend to make this a STANDALONE TITLE, you MUST HAVE TUTORIALS! I skipped out on Pirates as it is too boring for my taste; I bought Freedom Cry because it gave me pirates without the boring story I don't care for.

It does have variety of stuff to do and enough for its price. About 4-10 hours of gameplay depending on how much side stuff you do.   This is practically a compact and cheaper version of the AC experience you'll get from the bigger games of the series. If you're completely unfamiliar with the AC series, I recommend grabbing this from a sale before trying the other games of the series.",

As an avivid assassins creed series fan, having completed all to a 95%+ completetion rate as well as following the series before it started. i quite liked this spin off, being the Black ex-slave to free your brothers felt very rewarding.  + Graphics as always with AC games + Storyline - amazing story line + Voice acting - very realistic sounds + slave idea is so unique and amazing! really enjoyed it.  - buggy as hell like previous AC's. they always release them way too soon! - controls, dislike how 'free' running isn't very free and seems to always go in the wrong direction you want it to. the character can jump 4 feet up and grab a tiny crack but not pull run up a wall with bars you can easily hold on to. this has happened since the free running changed from 'A' (on xbox controllers) to 'RT' it seems to be terrible now. - story length was pathetic with this one. 3 hours it took me to get 93% completion. i realised after 2 missions i was 42% through so tried to take my time but there wasn't many side quests.  Overall graphics 8.5/10 gameplay 6.5/10 story 8/10  Replability? No unfortunatly, its not long enough to enjoy again.",
