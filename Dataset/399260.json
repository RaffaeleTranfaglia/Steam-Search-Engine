            "review_text": "This game may sound like a children's everyday game, but it's actually a neat puzzle platformer. This puzzle solving is ingenious, the character I actually find adorable, and the programming is well designed. Anyone who's into platforming games, who want to try something new, this is the game for them.",

            "review_text": "Too linear. Basic platformer with sluggish controls. You can get stuck.  Story is generic. Music is extremely monotonous - and not in the relaxing but annoying way. Massive tearing.  Change of language does nothing. Keeps using the system language.  Only the graphics is cute-ish.",
