            "review_text": "Xeodrifter is a neat little Metroid-like. The abilities are unique and used to good effect with some inventive environment-traversal tricks. I liked the setup of moving between four different planets instead of having four different areas interconnected on the same planet. The weapon-upgrading system is excellent; being able to experiment with different weapon types by redistributing your upgrade points at any time is a great touch.  The game has its weak points, but they're more on the order of minor gripes than major flaws. At first I didn't like the way my character jumped (always reaching maximum height instead of varying depending on how hard I pressed), but I got used to it. You fight the same boss character repeatedly, which may be a little tedious, but the fight changes over time, and its recurrence plays a role in the (admittedly thin) story. I really wish I could have cycled through weapons without going to the pause screen; the left and right triggers on my controller were just begging to be used. I also wish I could have used the thumbstick for movement, because the absolute worst part of this game was my 360 controller's d-pad.  Xeodrifter doesn't overstay its welcome; my six-hour playtime is quite a bit longer than necessary because I spent some time jumping against every wall I could, trying to find a couple of secret passages that were eluding me. But despite it being a little on the short side, it felt like the right length to me, and made for a nice bite-sized weekend diversion. I have a big soft spot for Metroidvanias in general, so I'm predisposed to giving a thumbs-up here, but I found a lot to like.",

The game offers hidden weapon upgrades, hidden health upgrades and the power ups you need to get to new areas are only provided from defeated bosses. Speaking of bosses that's this games only weak point (minus the length of course). There's only ONE boss throughout the entire game, but you fight this ONE boss 10 times or so. Everytime you meet up with this guy he just gets a little tougher each time.  One really GREAT concept is the jumping back and forth between the foreground and the background. I'm not sure if I've ever did that in a game before. Either way, it was fun to do and a welcome edition for Metroidvania's that I'm hoping makes it to others games in the genre.  If you enjoy fun gameplay, a great soundtrack and Metroidvania style gameplay this game is for you. A tad bit on the short side so grab it on sale to negate buying remorse. And always make sure to check for hidden rooms through false walls! ;)",

            "review_text": "[Spoiler-Free Review]  In space, no one can hear you scream... for Metroidvania!   Game length  Xeodrifter is a bite-sized burst of platforming, exploration, and re-traversal. It took me roughly 4.5 hours from start to 100% completion, but I’d imagine the game could be completed comfortably in 2-3 if you aren’t overly concerned with finding secrets. Post-game content and replayability are basically non-existent however, so if you’re getting the game, know that there isn’t a lot to do after the end credits.   Level Progression  You start out on a ship surrounded by a few planets. With no clear idea of where to go, the player is left to figure things out on their own; that’s fine. The problem is, when you’re given the option to visit any planet right from the get go, you don't expect to have to bounce around between only two of them before being able to make any headway in the others. I found myself reaching an impasse on a few occasions, with no recourse but death (losing any progress/pickups collected along the way). It’s frustrating because you don't realize you aren't meant to explore certain planets until much later in the game. If a few of them were uncovered over time, this wouldn’t be such an issue.   Navigation  Stages are a series of interconnected pathways and shortcuts (basically a big loop with smaller loops within it). Unfortunately, the experience of navigating through the stages is kind of cumbersome. If you revisit the boss lair after defeating it, for example, the door closes behind you and you'll have to go through a section of the map just to get back to where you started. It had me wishing for a way to cut the trip short at times. Thankfully, unlocked skills help alleviate some of the hassle of re-exploring the stages, but never enough that you feel excited to trek back down some of the longer hallways previously visited. Re-traversal with a disregard for the player's time isn’t the best design choice! An option to teleport directly to your ship would have made longer journeys a bit less grueling.   Enemies  Planetary inhabitants are varied, though I think a few more types would have been welcome. Some are very clearly influenced by classic Metroid enemies, both in appearance and movement patterns. The highlight for me was the animation cycle of a snail-like creature (sometimes it’s the little things that grab your attention). Ultimately, I would have liked to see each planet house its own set of enemy occupants, rather than being reused across each stage, but in a package the size of Xeodrifter, it may be asking too much.  What’s really disappointing are the bosses, which are basically re-skins rather than completely unique in appearance and function. The design is cool, but fighting the same enemy, albeit with different special attacks and such, made for an unexciting finale to each stage. It’s one of the only things that feel cheap about the game.   Controls  The main character is very quick and has a slightly slippery feel when moving across the stage; it’s almost too fluid. Worst of all, jumping isn’t set so that short presses result in a hop, and longer presses result in higher jumps. This leads to some frustration as the character ends up feeling fatally irresponsible. Rather than a tiny hop to avoid an incoming bullet, for instance, the character jumps as high as possible (even if it means hitting another bullet at that height). It isn’t unforgivable except for the fact, certain enemy shot patterns and movements create situations where you’re going to die regardless if/how you react. Taking a hit because it’s impossible to avoid, goes against a lifetime of learned player instinct.  On the subject of player instinct, there are sections in some of the stages where you need to drop below a platform by pressing down, then jump. The game never explains how to deal with the obstacle. While experienced gamers will know this by heart, newcomers may not, so it’s disappointing to leave them without proper instructions.   Atmosphere  Xeodrifter does a fantastic job in capturing the feeling of visiting unexplored planets, they’re strange and mysterious, with a hint of familiarity. It’s nice to see a game do mood so well. Encountering alien lifeforms and collecting artifacts and upgrades always felt exciting. The art style is incredible, and the concept, timeless.   Audio  The NES-inspired music is great! Enough so, that I remained fixated on the title screen for as long as it took to hear the entire track. Afterwards, I went straight to the options screen and credits, just to hear more. Sound FX are suitable for the setting, save for one sound which is overused and somewhat comedic; the effect used when you destroy the enemy inhabitants. It’s rough, and is best described as the sound of a coughing dog? (or a tire braking hard while travelling at 100mph). As killing anything results in the sound, it kind of breaks some of the atmosphere, especially when eviscerating anything with a goo-like appearance (shouldn’t they emit a squishy sound?).   Final Thoughts  Xeodrifter is a competent and enjoyable take on classic Metroid gameplay. It’s somewhat short, and has its flaws, but remains an easy recommendation for players looking to scratch an exploratory itch. Get it in the hope it helps the developer create more games like this in the future.",

You are then tasked with finding your way out of the situation by shooting through various enemies, and collecting incredibly creative power-ups that will help you reach more areas. In classic, retro platforming style, the boss encounters test your reflexes and your ability to pick up on patterns. Every time I successfully brought the boss down, it evoked a true feeling of victory.  It's a very basic premise that is executed marvelously. The graphics are great, the music is appropriately fitting, and the controls are very smooth. I highly recommend this title.",

There is a certain charm to having such tiny graphics though. The sound/music seem to fit nicely as well. The one thing I wasn't a fan of is the movement. It feels deliberately soft with the slight acceleration/deceleration, and for a game with such small graphics it could have done without that feature. Of course, that's just my opinion!  It's my understanding that Renegade Kid made this game in something like 5 months, and with that in mind, I think it's a really good accomplishment!

            "review_text": "Xeodrifter is a lot of fun, but is a little short. Let's make a quick list for you.  Good: - Gun upgrades - They are kind of ambiguous, but it actually forces you to try out the different combos of how you can create your gun and allows you to choose really different build paths. Pretty cool feature! - Fun skills - You pick up skills as you progress through the game that not only help you through levels, but help you do them quicker and more efficiently. You can also manipulate them creatively to take on bosses! - Secret rooms - If you're anything like me, you'll love finding the secret rooms in here. The first secret room I stumbled upon was completely by accident   jump-running into a wall  . See what you can find! - Level builds (also see 'not so good') - The level builds are creative and once you start earning your upgrades, you're going to really appreciate the way they are constructed. There aren't many levels, but you'll be able to revisit them with your upgrades to explore even more! - Achievements - GET THEM!  Not So Good: - Short game - I don't have much time down on this game and once it was done, I found myself hoping there was more, like maybe some extra content once it's beaten. - Level builds - Some of the levels builds are pretty in-depth, which is pretty awesome while you're exploring, but when going back to look for secret rooms or upgrades, some of the levels can be really long and it takes a long time to get back to the spot where you would find the secret/upgrade. I found myself sort of annoyed that I had to go through that level and run all the way back just for 1 item. Having said that, it's not a terrible feature, just 'not so good.' - Boss algorithms don't change much - [Minor Spoiler]  The bosses are pretty much the same boss, but a different color, which doesn't create a ton of variety. They do, however, (after this first boss) add on to the previous boss' repertoir, so while the algorithms do change a bit, there is a bit of familiararity of skills. I could be a cool feature, but by the end of the game, it wasn't hard to take down the last boss becase you pretty much know what he is going to use the whole time.   Though I wouldn't say that it necessarily takes away from the boss fights being fun.  Overall, 8/10. Wish there was more, but I was engaged and excited every time I was playing this game. The devs definitely get props for this one. They made this game so refreshing and fun.",

It's well-polished and easy to get into, with solid platforming controls and pretty smooth presentation for a pixel-art game.  Cons: The game's biggest flaw is that it's ultimately fairly shallow. I finished the whole thing, including finding nearly all of the optional power-ups, in under 4 hours. There aren't that many enemy types, and you'll see the same basic behaviors over and over as you traverse the game world. Worst of all, the boss fights are incredibly repetetive; every new boss is a palette-swapped minor enhancement on the last, right up through the end of the game.  Overall, this game provides a decent if repetetive few hours' of amusement. Probably worth the $10 asking price if you have the cash lying around, but only barely. Grab on sale if you can.",
