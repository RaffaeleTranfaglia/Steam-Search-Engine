            "review_text": "The knifethrowing zombies absolutely ruins this game! I have every health upgrade available they still kill me with one throw! The zombies respawn way too fast and way too close! I whipe out a small area only to find that they respawned on the exact same spots as i were minutes ago just killed them. Respawning enemies can be one of the worst things in games in my opinion. Its frustrating and pointless! Respawing enemies is OK only if it doesnt happen too frequently and only if the enemies becomes slimmed down, this is important so that i can feel some sort of accomplishment. If not, killing zombies will feel absolutely pointless! Sometimes the zombies will spawn right in front of your face and that NEVER happened in Dead Island! You save a guy from a horde of zombies and the next time you walk by the same zombies are there trying to grab the guy you saved even though the guy is gone... im like wtf is this? The zombies will be on to you and follow you even though you drive by in high speed, so every time i step out of the car i must fight stragglers, every single time and that gets tiresome so damn fast! Those who hasnt mastered the combat will have a frustrating experience since fast zombies will pop out of every bush on the island and this game makes you realise how bad the combat really is! The zombies are too freaking crowded in this game! I like dead island but this game is boring compared to the first one! Its prettier but no matter how much you pollish a turd it will still be a turd!",

It's still pretty clumsy in terms of gameplay. I mean, they haven't even touched the fighting system; compared to DL, it feels stale and very repetitive.   Pretty much all the characters featured are forgettable. In DL, every person had a ♥♥♥♥ing personality. Dead Island is full of dull people with horrible voice-acting.  BUTT ( YES, a wild butt appears)!!!  It is still pretty enjoyable. There is something very relaxing about this game, and I think I'm going to give it a chance,  tl;dr - You played Dead Island games and liked them, but want better graphics? Buy Definitive Edition.  You played DI and found it bad? Forget this game.  You didn'y play DI games but want to give them a whirl? That's the moment, don't be shy. ",
