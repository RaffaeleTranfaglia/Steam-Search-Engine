            "review_text": "Helpful advice: before you start playing, go to '(your Steam Folder)\\steamapps\\common\\WALL E\\WALL-E\\GameSetup.exe' and configure the Video settings, making the video resolution to max, and configuring the controls in a way that you would find comfortable.  NOTE: you MUST set the In-Game Jump key and the Menu-Confirm key to the same button, or else you'll get stuck.  Review:  This game is a really fun 3D Platformer. It brings a very interesting twist on platforming, as Wall-e, being a robot, can not jump very high. However, if Wall-e uses a ramp and gains some speed, he can really leap very far. This adds a lot of dynamic to the game. The game also has a great variety of stages. There's platforming stages, exploration/collectaphon stages, speeding stages, flying stages, and shooting stages. And while it starts pretty easy, it does get more difficult later on, as platforming will get more difficult, and enemies will try to prevent you from making progress. Most of the stages also have collectables for you to find, which consist on BNL crates you can break, and Artificats you can collect. This adds a lot of replay value if you're into those kind of things. My only complaint is that the later levels get pretty long, and the checkpoints are few and far between. Which means, if you have to quit, you might not have enought time to reach the next checkpoint, and therefor have to leave, erasing some progress. The 'video cutscenes' also don't look very well on modern computers, and the fact that you can't scip them can get annoying. However, the cutscenes made on the game's engine are very well made, and althought they don't give you the feelings you would get from watching the movie, the story is still very well presented. Both the Earth and the Axiom look great, giving you 2 very different enviorment styles - the junk that has piles up on earth, and the cleanness modern coridors of a space ship. Overall, this game is a very enjopyable experience. Just remember that this is a 2008 game, and a port of a PS2/PSP game, so expect to see PS2 graphics. But they still look great.",
