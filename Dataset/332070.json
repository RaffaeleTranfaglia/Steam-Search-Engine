            "review_text": "I read a few comments about this game before I installed it. Many people wrote about how bad it was but as it has dragons in it, I wanted to try it for myself.  So after having played this what I can say is that every single bad review about this game was true. I've never thought a game could be this laggy or buggy or in other words bad. But this game totally is. Comments like: 'I'd rather climb the huge mountain in kung fu panda in a wheelchair, miss all of it and not become the dragon warrior than play this game again.' - They are absolutely true. After playing this game you may feel a severe lack of will to carry on living. But to be fair and objectively, I will go on with some facts about pros and cons:   Pros: It has Toothless, the dragon from the movies in it, so if he was your favorite character, this might be interesting.  Cons: Almost everything else about the game. The graphics are okay. But it doesn't really matter, when you can't even walk more than two steps before the game crashes. When you finally can fly with your dragon, it is so slow that you can do laundry, go to the toilet, make dinner, go shopping and load a website with Internet Explorer, before arriving at the next destination. It's the same with loading screens. They are so long, that i almost forgot i had the game running in the background a few times.  The reason I called it School of Payment is simple: You log in and half of the screen wants you to buy a membership, gems or a starterpack.   Nevertheless I had at least a bit fun playing this, I am not that big farmer, but without paying anything, it was the fastest and easiest way to get gold in the game. So I bought a few plants, sheep and chicken. Nearly sounds like fun, doesn't it? And it could be so much more fun, without the crashes which caused that my chicken, sheep and plants were gone without getting the money for them back. So I was trying to get gold without wasting money on this game. I tried to give this game a real chance. But it really didn't deserve it.  Wish I could recommend this piece, but honestly I can't. I searched for at least something good in this game, but there's nothing. I wasted nearly 35 hours of my life with that game. Sadly, not even including Toothless is worth playing it.",

            "review_text": "So here's my short opinion on School of Dragons.  I downloaded it with some friends because we were all curious about how a game based off this particular franchise would go. To be honest none of us really expected much. Upon downloading we were greeted by, if you have not already guessed from the other reviews, lots of loading screens. Loading screens aren't a bad thing...normally. But these are heavy and a bit sore on the eyes. The attempts to get you excited by all the new content fall flat when you cycle through the same 5 ads over and over for 10 minutes. They could be better designed but moving on.  The intro experience is a bit clunky but long story short you get to pick from a few dragon breeds and get your baby dragon. The colour customization is actually pretty solid and the dragon models are great for the level of graphics the game can handle. Excellent textures a fairly well contructed world and you're off to level up yourself and your baby dragon.  The game attempts to be educational and actually does a fairly decent job at being engaging about it...at first. You have some quests involving the scientific theory and although the game gets a bit 'please allow us to shove this information directly down your child's throat, you are very welcome' the sentiment does not go unnoted. You collect different minerals and see how they interact with dragonfire and check the results against your hypothesis. Actually kind of rad.  Too bad all the other science related quests are replaced with this Candy Crush Simulator that makes NO SENSE WHATSOVER. But I digress. I was fairly impressed at this point.  Then I tried to meet up with my friends.  After the initial dance of 'where are you' and 'meet me here' we finally made it to the same location. Only...my friends were not there. Ok, so there are different servers. No way to see which one you are on? No problem. We'll just exchange friend codes and teleport to each other. Only...you can only befriend someone on the same server as you.   Oh. Well then...challenge accepted. We spent the next hour switching from single player mode back to mmo mode until we found each other. Grand. Only there is a chance that when you leave the area you could swap servers. Graaaaaaand. No matter. We'll meet up later when our dragons can fly and explore together.  By the time our dragons could all fly, we had stumbled upon the most ridiculous series of bugs and paywalls imaginable.  Gems, in this game, just so happen to be truuuuuuly outrageous. They can be obtained for free, rarely and in small quantities. Otherwise you have to pay for them. That's fine, I don't need Gems right? Ho boy. You can't do anything without them.   Want another dragon? Gems. Saddle? Gems. Another go at a race? Gems. Open a chest you found? Gems. Start a clan? Gems.   Heck, some places you can't even get to without a membership. Not only that but if you don't have mum's credit card to get those sweet, outrageous beauties you can forget about playing at all. You're dragon can run out of energy. How do you fix that? Feeding them. How do you feed them? By fishing. Fishing bait costs gold which can be obtained through quests...which you need your dragon for. If your dragon is tired you can't do quests. Hazzah! I think you can recharge your dragon by paying gems though. So, yey.   Bugs include, quests that can only be completed by logging in on someone else's computer after attempting to light a campfire for two hours, quests that you never took, lead no where, and simply don't exist, and, my favorite, incomplete maps. INCOMPLETE MAPS.  There are literally places in this game where you can be flying over a mountain and suddenly it looks like the entire world is see through, like your minecraft server crashed or you're trying to play on your mum's flip phone again to prove you can. I was flying in the glitchy ocean (which should have a seziure warning on it btw because the shaders are bugged) and heading towards the island only to find a neat surprise. Its flat. Its literally a 2D render of the island the disappears when you pass go. I mean, come on. Don't make flying there an option if you're going to be lazy.  Half the trees are flat. There is a forest of 4 very sad, out of place trees in this one location that you have to go to for any quest involving chopping wood. MUST I GO ON?  And do you know what the worst part about this game is? It has freaking potential. It has such a good base but it feels like no one is working on it. I want to shut it down, give it to a team of college kids, and put it back up in a couple of months because it would probably be ACES and I would probably LOVE IT. Because flying on your own dragon is COOL and the setting is CHARMING but it all feels like an alpha game that someone ran out of energy for halfway through and still had to turn it in.  I hate this game and I want someone with some fire in their soul to take over the whole freaking project so I can sleep at night instead of sketching out ideas for a better system that does not wreek of being a quick cash grab. Ugh. Don't play it just go send some letters to the developers or find a kickstarter to fund. I don't know just don't download this until someone takes responsibility for this beautiful disaster.",

The graphics are breathtaking, with every step in game like a step in real life, outdating modern games like Call of Duty and Crysis by a minimum of 10 years. In addition to the amazing visuals, gameplay is supporting by a groundbreaking game engine, crafted from literal scrap by the game development team, allowing 60+ FPS on even mediocre computers, allowing the game to be available to all. The sheer power the game engines allow, leave the only thing left to your computer to do is render the screen in 4k quality. Even the sound quality is increased, at upwards of 1000 in terms of bitrate. But how does the story hold up in comparison to the other aspects? Needless to say, the critics are literally raving, 6 of which died last night from cocain overdosing. A deep and engaging plot, with love, war, and even a war of love with a beautiful twist on the traditional romance scene. This game a definite 420 out of 69, would bang.' - writer, E. L. James",

I played this on the webbroser in the begininng of this game when it still was maybe a year old or so. It have chaced a lot. It is more balanced between players that are members and non members then it was when i startet to play it. Geting gems was hard. The only way to get them was to pay reall money. Now i only need to send my dragons on ther own quest to get me more gems!  The comunity seems to be better to. Rememmebr many players that was members looked down on non members just becuse they had more rare dragons at the time. You could also shoot others at the time and it made the happines lvl on your dragon sader faster. The battel edvent dint exist and there was not many places to go to as you can today! Today you can lock up the expetions packs whit gems and dont have to be member as you had to be when it was new to the game and there is a lot more dragons then it was in the beginning.  The game is better then what it was when it started but... it still have its issues... It get bugs a lot of them! The game masters take forever to fix them! I can thell you it always been like that! The chat is as bad as it was back then to! I am not surpriced that many that started to play the game at the same time as me have left it!  Would i recoment this game to others since i am still am playing it? The answer is YES and NO! If you have patient and dont mind to wait on bugs getting fixed in a year or if you are lucky in a moths and love the series HTTYD then it is a yes but if you are noting of the sort then it is a no!  I ask myself some times... Way i am i still playing this? and i still do but there is somting i find fun whit it and i guess it is the dragons! It is like pokemon! You try to get them all!

The Admins in this game are constantly updating it, adding new expansion packs ( e.g Icestorm Island), releasing new dragon eggs, new items/clothing ect. The possabilties in this game are pretty much endless! You can go on to the official site and check the forums for the latest updates and news! There is loads of activities to do like Thunder Run Racing, Fire Ball Frenzy, Bulls Eye Lagoon ect. along with all the quests you are given through out your adventure to becoming an Ultimate Dragon Trainer!  The only thing I really dislike about this game is its glitches, connection issues and the occasional moment where the server times out. These can be resolved by a simple restart.

And it doesn't give you the right to review if you AREN'T even a young child or adult that looks for kid games for your child!   This is a game where young children play with their favorite dreamworks characters, and will enjoy it. Everything is okay with it when you have a GOOD, WORKING COMPUTER. Both the application and the personal computer version of the game is fine. It's just the older people like teenagers and adults that grown out of kids games like these that are giving this game a FALSE BAD NAME!  I recommend this game for young children and for people who just want non violent gaming or have their child learn bad habits from older aged games.",

I'm surprised at all they allowed my character to be called Nibelungenlied.   I downloaded the game to try to see if it was safe for the younger members of my family. But I'm not even sure it could hold their attention. The entire game is lifeless and bland. They would have more fun sitting there watching me play other titles, and doing nothing themselves. I don't even mind the membership ads. An online game has to keep servers running somehow. The control scheme is supremely archaic. And I mean that in the sense of early 90s experimental controls for PC. It is in no way optimized for modern gaming whatsoever.   Just....just don't. Don't bother downloading. The premise is freaking awesome, but the execution is extremely poor. Save yourself some time and go download Wizards 101 or Pirates 101 for your young ones.

Why, because this game teaches you about things that should not be in this game this therefore reduces the lore to the movies by well about 67%. POINTERS for the DEVS: 1. Don't teach gamers stuff. PERIOD. 2. Free up the game a little bit, give some freedom to the players of this game. 3. Less ads and more of the the lore and freedom (like before). 4. Less offers to buy stuff for money. (I understand you want to make money and all but people who play video games HATE ADS AND RANDOM POP-UPS THAT KILL THE GAMEPLAY!!!) 5. I haven't got far enough to see if this is actually a feature but, Free (flying) roaming, like... Exploring berk while flying on your dragon. Summary: It's a great game but... Has olmost every aspect of a Pay-to-win game. If your Kid or yourself is stuggling in prek - 4th grade then this is the game for you. BUT A FAIR WARNING!!! If your child or yourself get's too attached to this game (somehow) get ready to lose all your money because, its a game where you will get mad at having a stupid dragon and then spending 56.99 to buy 500 gems to get like 6 virtual dragons that last like 6 months.(not really) But its ok a little less than what i though it was.(a little pathetic overall) which makes it a below average game.

There are lots of problems with this game that -I feel- if are fixed this will be a much loved game. For starters; 1. Glitches Almost everywhere there are glitches, mainly graphic ones though. Everytime I try to complete a certain quest the game freezes and I yet again, have to restart the game. 2. Graphics A ladder (that is the only way to get to the top of a mountain without a flying age dragon) you cannot climb without getting stuck and having to restart the game. Deep sea fishing, when you get close to the water the sea turns white and starts flashing as well as the rock you sit on out there is highlight pink. It always ignores the fact that wings are not like ghosts and should not go through rock. The trees are in 2D...? 3. So Expensive! Anything that has to be bought is expensive, even as a member with a discount. The dragons I understand, but things like 70 Gems for a new hairstyle? 8 gold per piece of bait? 48 gold for 1 seed of carrots? Animals! Food for animals/Dragons! 4. Dragons There is only One Skrill In the show as well as one Night Fury So why can I buy a Skrill and paint it whatever colour I want but only one Night Fury- Toothless (whose colour cannot be changed and can only be obtained through being a member). Also, More dragons should be made into the game because I want more for my growing collection. I would also like to be able to sell my dragons incase of double-ups because I'm sure you get a Whispering Death for completing a certain mission. I already have one and do not wish to go through all my missions to level up a dragon I alrweady have. 4. Missions I feel there is not enough missions. I have often run out of them on both profiles, there is one that you are always able to do but you get 5 gold, 5 XP, 5 Dragon XP and 5 UDT points for it for 30 minutes of stuff. There is also a mission that cannot be completed on both profiles due to a glitch where it freezes when you are about to make a step to complete it. Leaving me with only one possible mission that is a complete waste of time. 5. Education...? RUFKM? If I wanted to see the words Hypothisis, Scientific Method, Convex, Concave, Botanist, Chemical Reaction, Science Experiment, Refract or Prisim I would be playing a Breaking Bad, Big Bang Theory, Science Class cross over game. I get that it is driven for kids but no matter how many times you say most of these the average kid is going to be like 'WTF? I want to get back to the Dragons!'. It makes me feel lame when those words come up because I remember that my actual nerd friends are playing WoW and LoL and I am in fact playing a kids game.  With all these issues I still love this game and still recommend it. I can fly a dragon! I'm going to be honest and say that I have no idea why I like this game. But I do, I've told you all these problems to give you a clear image of the game and although I can't particually give you reasons to play it apart from 'FUN' and 'DRAGONS' I ask you give it a go and get your own opinion of this game that I set Anime aside for.",

I loved How to Train your Dragon 1 and 2, and even the Netflix mini-series. I thought it would be a decent game, after seeing the good reviews, (I only see the bad reviews after getting the game, for some reason) and, after all, its only $0.00 (+ over $100.00 in in-game content).  The first thing you notice when you turn on the game is that you made some pretty bad life choices. The second thing you notice is that you are already praying for God to have mercy on your soul. The third thing you is When you get to play the game, you need to make an account, or you get named 'VIKING18346718' so i made an account, and i chose the name 'Pingas'. And it said it had symbols. Really? Ok. I can live with that. Named my character 'ButterGamer' in homenage for PBG. The game wouldn't let me name it that way cuz' it had the word 'Butt' in it.  Finnaly got to the game aaaaaand... wasted 1 minute and 5.12 seconds waiting for the game to load. Aaaaaaaaand... Wasted another minute cuz the game was downloading stuff. Aaaaaaaand FINALY got to play the game. What i saw was atrocious. The quality of the graphics were terrible. I mean... this game was made in 2014 and even still, it looks like the graphics were made by an 11 year old learning how to make a game, or this game was made with the same program the GameCube games were made.  The genious that made this game decided not to give any collision detection to some of the NPC characters (and sometimes, you fall under the floor).  After that, i just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off and uninstalled it. Wait, you can fly as Toothless?  10/10 BEST GAME 2014",

It feels like a tablet game that you try to play with pc controls. Also the framerate is horrendous on a powerful pc like mine and a strong internet connection the servers were completely awful. But thats not even the worst of it.   What was worse, was the fact that even when taking 2 steps after trudging through the awful tutorial you have pay to win ♥♥♥♥ shoved in your face. Immediately you see dragons from the film and show only being available if you pay so already you are limited. Its a cash cow and an awful one at that, it just doesn't keep you invested.   I really tried to play more but i just couldn't, the wonky controls that made walking a chore and the framerate issues combined with the fact that a huge gameplay mechanic for an mmo that is supposed to keep you busy constantly is literally sitting around waiting for an egg to hatch. So to put it nicely this game is unplayable and i can't even see how children would find this enjoyable.",
