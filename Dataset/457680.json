            "review_text": "Not worth the asking price in my opinion,.. but it is really a great little game.  It takes less than 2 hours to complete the story mode, even just playing casually. After completing the story mode you unlock a freeroam mode which allows you to continue to explore and fart around with the core game.  You can completely finish the game, missions, 100% achievements, everything, in less than 4 hours.  If the game were more of the $4.99 USD price range I'd be able to recommend it. Get this with a steaply reduced sale price and enjoy a pleasant experience.",

            "review_text": "Who knew looking for planets through a telescope could be this intense and emotional?  The core mechanic is simple, but it has enough variety to remain interesting, while the story lends the activity increasing urgency. The characters likewise are simple but likeable enough.  While I found the experience engaging throughout, there does not seem to be quite enough meat to justify the full price. Multiple playthroughs may provide additional rewards, but I don't think I will feel compelled enough to repeat it.  The devs set out to create something different, and they definitely achieved that goal. If you are looking for an engaging, short story experience with a simple fun mechanic, OPUS is an easy recommend on sale.",

            "review_text": "Played it for a few hours. Was worth playing for the story it told and the music it included. Plus who DOESN'T like space stuff. I don't think I can go one second into this game without saying: 'HOLY S*** THAT NEBULA THO... AWE, screenshot go speed background go!'  I really like the theme of the game. Space is a really vast place and this game actually does a good job with keeping up with the accuracy to that theme. Meanwhile the story elements of the game are very nicely tied together with small breadcrumbs. Plus when not stargazing, the game reminds me of a point and click game where you go clicking on small objects and details to find their significance in the story. Which I think is a nice detail to add.  Overall. Loved the characters, Loved the visuals, Loved the music, and I enjoyed the ending (and I won't spoil it). Worth playing instead of watching on youtube.",

            "review_text": "Thinking about the price for the game, I think it is well deserved, if not for the story, at least for the idea, the intention and the music.   I found the story interesting in the beginning but very disappointing in the end. I was expecting some sort of meaningful lesson to be learned, but it was nothing like that. I was actually quite surprised that the end was the least interesting between all the ideas of an ending that I would have thought about. Too bad...  I was also a bit turned off by the repetitive nature of being forced after each successful scan to get back to the ship screen in order to follow the next phase of the story. There seem to be some lose ends in the story with all the missing notes and such, which I couldn't find anywhere. It felt that I get clues for non-existing puzzles.  I took my time a bit playing the game, using the more 'challenging' mode and did not rush straight to the end of the story. I just wanted to explore a bit around, but in the end, I didn't quite understood what was the game expecting of me, gameplay wise, besides completing some achievements.  Overall it felt that the game tried to do more than be just a 'walking simulator' and compromised a bit too much to achieve that goal.  It is a keeper for me, but I can't really recommend it.",

Obviously not for the adrenaline junkie, it's a slow game that rewards curious-minded poking at things.  Only real negative, IMO, is that some 'curiosity' quests won't be unlocked if you click on things before the starmap zone it's in is unlocked yet. So this means, you need to scour the station at every major unlocking event, re-clicking everything which the protagonist even vaguely said 'I'm not ready for this yet' towards.",
