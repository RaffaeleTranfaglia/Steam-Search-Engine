            "review_text": "This game gets a lot of ♥♥♥♥ for it's imprecise controls and frustrating platforming sections. And sadly, that criticism is mostly justified. Some of the platforming parts require perfect timing or result in instant death, and they very nearly made me quit the game. But I did eventually get through them, and that was with a 360 d-pad. If you use keyboard or a better d-pad things should get easier.  But the fact that I did struggle on until I got past those sections speaks for how good the rest of the game is. It is a linear 2D action game with a focus on high scores. I guess you could compare it to a 2D DMC, but with a more limited move set. But every move has its use and I thought the controls worked well for the combat. A lot of the time you will be fighting a bunch of enemies on a single screen, so positioning and awareness is just as important as what combos you do. I think the combat is simply a joy!  The graphics and animations are awesome too. It's what a modern Castlevania game should look like (no disrespect Bloodstained, you still look good).",

The game has amazing 2D graphics, with a good sountrack. Rayne has some cool move like sucking ennemies blood, poisoning them to make them then explode. Some of the sequences and bosses were enjoyable (the last boss and the boss before the last one.) with learning patterns etc. However the game is highly flawed in my opinion. In the first place, the controls. The controls aren't as responsive as they should be. The moving and platforming is okay, when you fail a platform, it's your fault, but the fighting mechanics are just frustrating as hell. It's simple, you're just mashing the X button to hit the ennemies, again and again with few variations. Besides, there is no invulnerability frames when they put you down, which means, a lot of time you will be back up but will go again down because they keep hitting you while you can't do anything. With more than 4 ennemies on the screen, the fighting looks like a mess and I had almost no idea of whom I was hitting and where I was.  There are some scoring to do and some collectibles to find, so for scorer or the achievement hunter, there are some thing to go back on. Same for the others, the game is still good enough to make you go back to it even with its flaws.",

But the combat feels good, a decent variety of enemies to beat up, blow up, chop up.  I'm figuring I'm almost done with the game, around level 13 and it's been really fun, they keep the gameplay mixed enough that it feels like you're always on your toes. Really nice 2D artwork and great music make for a fun 2D game you don't see much of these days.   360 controller users: The 360 controller works plug and play with this game however the dpad will make you want to stick a fork in your eye- this may be a more personal feeling but I don't like analog sticks for 2D games just never sat well. I wound up using the logtiech F310 which is detected as a 360 controller/works perfectly and the combat was much easier to do and overall felt it worked out better.",

Maybe an update will fix that. Valve has some really great ideas as to bigscreen, and this title sadly misses the mark, I don't even need UHD, but I do need fullscreen for a title like this. You lose life quite quickly, but you just have to suck bad guys dry to power up, requiring special moves. There are lights everywhere and you need to knock them out too, Its a very interesting game with lots to offer, not your typical mindless platformer. Its a great remake of a classic title improved upon, nice to see games like this coming out, one less reason to go buy a PS4.",

            "review_text": "If I made a list of things I think constitute bad video game controls, almost everything about BloodRayne Betrayal's controls would be on it. Confronted with every option of doing something to make the game flowing and fun, or making it feel numb and clunky, they seem to have opted for the latter.  It doesn't matter starting out. The game is gorgeous and has a modestly budgeted feel that makes it quite easy to forgive and even like initially. More maneuvers are introduced before long, and although it wears thin eventually, you have a decent amount of combat options to mix things up and express yourself with that stuff.  But when they take what is a fairly functional 2D brawler and apply it to platforming sections, it just turns into a miserable experience. Not miserable because it's impossible - it's not - miserable because there's absolutely nothing fun or stimulating about the arbitrary gameplay segments they force on you. They are just a chore. If you simply describe those sections to somebody - that you're asked to bounce on enemies to keep afloat while fighting other enemies - it sounds challenging and fun because you imagine that the controls are suitably responsive, but boy they sure aren't.  Truth is I really wanted to like this. It looks really, really cool and it's a fun and clever use of the license. There are plenty of moments when it's easy enough to gloss over its issues and enjoy, but when you first pick it up, the game immediately feels less snappy and responsive than you want a game like this to feel, and before it's over it asks you to perform precision movement that make its shortcomings impossible to ignore.",

Like, if you want to drain blood(which you will want most), most of time you either will be countered cause you're too late or you will poison them because you're smashing B button for the right time.   Combat mechanics are really poor, you have one attack button, you have gun but you can't use it in mid-battle since controls doesn't respond that fast, you can't dodge when enemy draws his weapon for the same reason, all left is hearing our cute Blooadrayne's arousing 'Aaah, Ooh' cries. Combat is really annoying.   Game is no fun. Just play Shank 1 and 2. Maybe Onikira too.",

            "review_text": "Apparently I can run Tomb Raider with those fancy hair graphics but not this in anything but a 800 resoultion box.  Okay now that I'm done being ♥♥♥♥ about that we can get to a review.  I don't feel it added up compared to the other games. The controls were awful for a side scroll beat'em up. The bosses (I only played to the second one) were just a reskin, same badguy with a weird if you fall off me you don't reach the end of this bottomless pit I just suck you up and spit you above me so you can kill feature. Yet as soon as you kill it you reach the bottom. Anyway back to the reskin, the first time I fought it I though hmm thats annoying but interesting. its added in 4 little targets I have to hit not just smash its face like everything else. The second boss they are like 2 minutes before hey use this random skill you've had but we never told you about to open this one wall. Now boss time! Same exact boss but they made it so you have to use that one pesky skill to break open its weak points, and since that would be too simple lets just throw hordes at you while you do it.  Even that I could have lived with but the kicker of why I'll never play this again is the backflip. Apparently a double jump feature is just so over done they had to add in a backflip. Logically you just have to push a button to do it right? wrong you have to make her run one direction then quickly turn and run the other way to make her slide then hit the jump button and she will backflip. Now the first couple times its annoying but doable at the later stages when you have to do it on small platforming sections I found it near impossible to complete both on controller and keyboard.  Oh and if you want you can mario stomp enemies because your highheels will kill them, and there are sections of using that to kill your way up long drops which I found pointless especially since you had to time a attack as you landed on them rather than just let it land on them.  The gun I have so far I don't know about the whole game but atleast upto where I quit is a 5 shot pistol that damn near 1 shots everything in a line. While that sounds cool the ammo for it comes and goes so sometimes you can spam it other times for levels you won't find a single bullet.",

            "review_text": "A mediocre platformer overall, I think. BloodRayne: Betrayal is a platformer from Abstraction Games. Let’s get rocking.  The Good  The artwork in this game was great. It had a very retro/comic book feel to it (something that really works for platformer games, in my opinion). The animations were, likewise, well done. Combat looked good and everything played out smoothly. Movement looked smooth, but there were some problems there that’ll I’ll get to in a bit.  There was a sufficient amount of gore; definitely as much as you’d want from a vampire game. Occasionally there is a Mortal Kombat-esque blood explosion, but it really adds to the whole atmosphere in it’s own charming way.  The Bad  Movement is pretty clunky in BR:B. Some areas require you to perform a ridiculous backflip to access. If you knew how tedious it is to perform a backflip in this game, you’d know why that is a bad thing. Or, you can just take my word for it.  Spike traps are a lot more like “let’s plaster razors on everything traps”. Barely grazing the side of a spike trap will result in a hefty amount of damage to you.  As far as I can tell, this game didn’t have much of a story line if it had one at all.  The Meh  The game itself is repetitive in several aspects. Enemy variety is limited and you’ll be fighting a lot of the same monsters over and over again in varying quantities. The music is okay at first, but it too gets old after a while. While the combat animations are pretty nice, combat will seem repetitive in a hurry as well.  The controls really aren’t all that streamlined as far as platformers go and gameplay starts to become a bore.  Verdict: Nay  It’s been a few reviews since I had to give a game the thumbs down. BR:B is mediocre, at best, but, if you’re a fan of the Blood Rayne franchise, you may enjoy it. As always, thanks for reading.",

Trickjumping is, And i do not mean platforming, But trickjumping (A combination of a few jumping 'mechanics' at the proper time to execute a successful jump), e.g. : Slide and jump, Goomba jump, Blown to the air/take damage jump, and so on. And this is not the reason why i bought this game, And is more than enough to ruin it to the threshold of whining in a bad review.  Another downside is the color saturation, But that's more on a personal note, it actually made my eyes hurt.  One last downside, because why not, Sometimes you get 5 checkpoints in a row (yay). and some levels you are lucky to get one....  The combat is fun for a while but who cares since its not the main goal of the game, Once again it seems like a development studio forgot what game they were trying to develop.
