            "review_text": "Before you buy Darkstone, be aware that this game is over decade old. The graphics, is, well, not pretty. The gameplay is pretty fun, though, and if you are into Diablo-esque RPGs you may want to give it a try.  To those who are worried if Darkstone will run on their modern systems, it works perfectly on my Windows 7 without any readily apparent bugs or visual glitches. Though naturally, I can’t vouch it will work for everyone, but steps to make this game work on modern systems were obviously taken (my old CD version stopped working ages ago).",

FAVORITE GAME EVER BTW.",

This has a well balanced loot system and leveling isnt as important as strategy and taking your time. I think this is a classic and should be purchased immediatley. 4.99 $ is obsurd for how much gameplay time this provides.",

And if you're going to complain about graphics....c'mon. It's from 1999 lol. Don't judge a book by its cover and don't judge a 16 year old game by its graphics.  Overall great game 8.5/10",

I have applied the fixes that have been suggested and at one time did have it running in the top left hand corner of my screen in a small square. Upon exiting I have not managed to get it to run again since.   Ga,es really need to be tested before being placed on Steam and it needs to be made clear if these will not work on newer systems. In future I will stick to getting old games on  GOG.com  as they have a money back policy if a game doesnt work.",

Windows 7 goes black on intro (after picking characters), and windows 8 has many graphical issues including invisible characters once you make it to the dungeon.  I'm not interested in 'fixing' this myself (it says it works on windows 7 and 8), i'm no technition, and nobody is going to pay me $25 and hour to do such work on a game i just bought. So guess I'll look forward to a working patch so that i can play this gem from my past, and change my thumbs down review.",
