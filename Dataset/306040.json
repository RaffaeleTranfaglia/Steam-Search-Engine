            "review_text": "(This copy of the game was provided freely by EpicQuest Games)  I don't particularly like to ragequit a game, but this is the first one that's driven me to do so in a while.  The Howler has a lot of things a good game should have. There's the unique concept of using your voice (or noise in general) to move your hot air balloon around the map. The artwork is beautiful and really worth taking a good time to enjoy. That's where it stops. Right there is where The Howler ceases and I find myself completely irritated with the game.  There is simplicity in the game. You are delivering parcels and you don't want your balloon oblierated on the ornate and breath-taking buildings. That's great and that would appeal to a wide audience there. That's perfect. Yet here's what flubs it up. The wind and weather direction should be something that gives you a slight challenge, not forces you to constantly restart the level because the angle wasn't just perfect so your balloon didn't pop or you didn't fly too high into the heavens. I've played similar games to this before and especially when you're starting out, they're a lot more forgiving with their wind merchanics. The Howler punishes you mercilessly on level 3 and continues to kick you in the stomach with that mechanic until you've had enough and switch the game off.  There's also the fact that the voice control, even when your microphone is on the most sensitivity possible, will not be enough to keep your balloon afloat. Now I'm aware that the game suggested I scream, but not everyone using Steam is living in a house where we have enough privacy to scream. If I have to make my voice raw to get that thing off the ground, why am I playing the game at all? That's entirely too much work and I'm not getting a sore throat just to play it.  The screens betwen levels are charming and give me the option to turn off the microphone (your mouse will be easier to play with at this rate, I suppose!) but little exposition except a bit of real life history of the city. There's no actual substansial story here and I was expecting a tiny bit more, given I felt teased with the artwork and fairly let down by game play.  It's like a really pretty flappy bird with a harder obstacle course you're supposed to scream at. I just didn't feel the need to open my big trap since it doesn't actually help!  Accessibility warnings? Transition screens are bright and have a white light. May cause migraines or seizures if you're sensitive. It certainly brought me a migraine. The repetitive motion of clicking upward gets sore (and pretty old!) fast as well.",

Can't not recommend it with 96% discount :)  P.S. and if you want to go completely insane you can play it controlling the balloon with your voice :D I haven't tried it, my arm was already hurting by the end after clicking a mouse button constantly.

You can also use your microphone and blow or yell to make it rise, but I really doubt many people will play that way except for a laugh. Some missions have you collect and/or drop off parcels in specific locations. Eventually, you encounter moving obstacles, rather than just the buildings you avoid hitting early on. It does what set out to do, and does it well enough. Maybe that's enough for you.",

Instead of an atmospheric meditative aeronautics trip over the rooftops of old Vilnius which I hoped for I got a gimmicky phisics based puzzle arcade without much substance - every level here is just a short but irritating obstacle course artificially made up of some unnatural structures that force you to perform miracles trying to use those wind directions on different heights to your favor. Even the interesting technology of motion control through noise generation doesn't add to the excitement. Screen resolution is fixed and won't stretch to fullscreen.  Жаль, что приходится голосовать против, потому что программа сделана аккуратно, с оригинальной эстетикой и точной механикой. Ощущения по началу приятные. Проблема в самом процессе игры. Вместо атмосферного медитативного воздухоплавания над крышами старинного Вильнюса, что я себе воображал, я получил замороченную физическую головоломку без особой глубины: каждый уровень - короткая раздражающая полоса препятствий, искусственно слепленная из противоестественных объектов, которые вынуждают вас творить чудеса, пытаясь использовать нужное направление ветра на той или иной высоте. Даже любопытная технология управления движением через подачу звука в микрофон также не добавляет интересности. Разрешение экрана фиксировано, на полный экран не разворачивается.",

I think I got about 40% done in about 15 minutes. I expect it to get harder. There is not much to say about the game, but here goes nothing.  It is a short game about a hot air baloon. There is a minimalistic story which helps to add a bit of something to the game. The art is fairly nice and unique. It seems that this game has a function to work with a microphone. I did not try this. While it may be fun, I expect it to be less precise. The controls are pretty good. The baloon has to do various tasks, such as picking up cargo, dropping it off, and landing. There is only one control, and that is gas (makes the baloon go upwards). The wind currents indicated on the side of the screen indicate the direction and speed of wind. While it is incredibly simply, it probably gets pretty challenging. Really, this game reminds me just a bit of the old game Pilotwings for the super nintendo. It is all about precision. It is an enjoyable little game. It's worth buying on sale. Unless there is a second map of levels beyond the first 17 or so levels, I would NOT recommend buying it at full price.",

Some of the levels can seem to be a bit tedious at times, but it wasn't anything to get too frustrated over. Gameplay-wise, it is a very simple concept that hasn't really been exercised in many other games as a main mechanic. it also has trading cards which, in my case, literally made the game pay for itself.
