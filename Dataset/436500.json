The atmosphere and theme are colourful and light, there is so much life and character to the space-port, its charming as balls! But at the end of the day you are broke as F***, you live in a trash can, you pick up junk, you eat the junk because you hardly have enough money to buy decent alien food and then you puke every where and wonder what the point of your life is.  In a crab shell its bloody brilliant, the game doesnt hold your hand, you are an insignificant blip in a large unforgiving world. If you enjoying exploring in a world full of intruige and weirdness then I highly recommend getting lost in this one!",

            "review_text": "  Though on the surface Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor may appear to be full of dull gameplay where all you do is clean up the streets of the spaceport day in and day out, after taking awhile to play and explore the game you begin to see that the point of the game isn't really the cleaning. Don't get me wrong, there is a ton of repetative trash disposing gameplay involved, but it feels like the game is about the stuggles of poverty and the hurdles involved with breaking free to reach the greener grass on the other side of the fence. If you are up for experiencing this sense of desperation and facing some tough feelings, give it a try. If you are in it for purely gameplay, you may not have the best time with it.

The graphics can be a little nauseating and I keep getting lost over and over. The first time I played I thought, 'Eh, this is okay. Probably won't play it again.' However, I randomly find myself getting on the game and saying 'I'll play just one more day.'",

I sort of expected that this would be a throwback to the likes of Space Quest, with engaging puzzles and inisting dialogue intertwined with witty references, but it wasn't like that.  Unfortunately there are still bugs: you can get stuck between the buildings (this one took some time finding), invisible walls in places, and certain someone doesn't show up in accordance with the quest and this is a huge drawback because it makes the game look incomplete.  If you want to buy it, you should probably wait until the developers patch some of the glaring issues. On other hand, if you'd like to be a drone in an unknown place without any hope for progression, well this might be just the type of walking simulator you've been waiting for.",

Stuck with a routine, repetitive job.  But all those weapons, magics, and, adventurers give you hope. A seemingly impossible dream that one day you will be able to get out of this hell hole, quit the stupid janitor job and go on adventuring in the vast space of the universe.  For me it resonate with the real life, the game connect with me deep inside. Everyone is struggling with something.  Don't lose hope !",

            "review_text": "I get that this is an 'anti-adventure' but the charm of repetitive routine in a colorful world wears thin very quick. Almost none of the loot you recover does anything. You either eat it, sell it, or drop at a shrine to increase your luck. You can't even do a 'Buy low, sell high' kinda thing because you are always getting a crap deal and its more cost efficient just to burn everything in a the street as you find it rather than spend an entire day looking for the correct merchant to sell it to, because you get paid by the city based on the amount of trash you incinerate a day. A game economy where all the loot you find is more profitable to you destroyed is a poorly designed game economy. The game has a bunch of hidden timers that are constantly ticking down that effect how much time you have left in a day. Your hunger meter is steadily decreasing and you have to find something to eat, your luck (as far as I can tell) is constantly ticking down and you have to pray at shrines and eat and hold items to increase it, your gender(?) meter is also degrading and you have to go to a Gender Kiosk to 'gendershift' so that the screen will stop being wonky. All of those things cost money and money is one thing you never have much of. If the game economy was better designed you might be able to make at least some money, but no, I have never had more than 150 MC and most items in game cost way more than that. I can buy food and gender and thats it. Everything else is out of my reach. I don't even know why you have an option to buy from street merchants because, other than food, your only viable option is to sell to them because, like I said above, you can't sell one merchant's items to another and expect to turn even a marginal profit. Its a poorly designed game with a lot of charm that it burns through right quick.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game, I really did. The concept is interesting, the art style is unique, and the surrealist humor seemed up my alley. Unfortunately, all that is marred by technical problems and a poor UI.   The biggest issue is that save games appear to be completely bugged out, so if you quit and restart the game, everything you've done and all of your inventory is wiped. (update: apparently the save file bug has been fixed since this review was posted) In addition, this game seems really unoptimized despite the simple graphics. I'm able to run other more graphically intensive games like Fallout 4 on max settings at 60fps, and this game still frequently dipped into 30fps for no apparent reason, so I can only imagine how poorly it would run on lower-end PCs.  The user experience is also pretty bad. You're dumped into a world with little to no explanation of core mechanics, which, when combined with the fact that most of the game world looks identical and has no map of any kind, makes it incredibly difficult to find specific NPCs for quests. Also, at one point, the janitor started vomiting profusely, which is apparently solvable with medicine, except there's no direction on where to actually find it, and is only made worse by the slow movement and graphical effects that sickness causes.  Overall, meh. Seems like it's trying to go for a Jazzpunk vibe, so it's worth checking out, but don't be surprised if you end up requesting a refund.",

There are several glitches and bugs preventing you from:  Keeping items in your inventory  finishing quests and  saving your game at all...  If they fix the game, it's worth playing, but right now I'd say a better title is  Diaries of Disappointment : /  UPDATE: As of 9/28/16 the game was updated and fixed and I was finally able to finish the game.   That being said I still hold to my original review.   After all the toiling around in this game, the milling, the confused causaways, the annoying trumpet song from THEDAY that will haunt my dreams forever, the ending was just too paltry to feel any sort of satisfaction from the uphill battle that was playing this game. I would probably have loved the game if it ran smoothly and hadn't bugged out and failed so many times. I probably would have loved the game if the ending had been worth the struggle! I probably would have loved this game if I didn't feel passive aggressively monitored by the game staff for reflecting on my frustration with their buggy product. Still, I am serious when I say Diaries of Disappointment.   Great game, but ensure your product runs properly before handing it to the masses, you know? What is this, SONIC BOOM?!??!? I'm looking at you SEGA!!!! lol jk : P",

            "review_text": "This is advertised as an anti-adventure game, but it's actually an anti-game game. You're just a lowly robot janitor picking up trash for pitiful amounts of credits that are whisked away quickly by either the red scarfed gestapos, the need for food, a fetch quest where you tickle someone's slime fancy, or your addiction to gender hormones.   You are surrounded by evidence of heros, there's weapons, quest logs, magic spells, and you can't use any of it because you're just a lowly janitor who cleans up after the party is over. You pray to various gods to raise your lucky and hopefully find better than usual items. The game world is confusing, the items and vendors numerous and confusing, the hormone addiction is confusing, the quests are confusing. It's great in a way, but it's not focused, and that's be design.   I enjoyed it for the first part, my overall experience was positive, but it felt really pointless and failed to draw me back in. I got too many games to play to play a game that isn't a game. It's an out of this world non-adventure that looks pretty trippy but personality and visual style only get you so far.   Overall, this non-adventure feels like a chore after the novelty wears off.",
