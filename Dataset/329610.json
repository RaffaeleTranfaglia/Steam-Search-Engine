            "review_text": "This is a nice game. It's a retro style Baseball game with an arcade feel to it. The graphics are decent; not over the top, and not bad either. It's good to see an MLB game on the PC.   Positives: A Baseball game back on the PC Works with a Logitech Dual Action Controller, however some of the controls don't match up; hit is button 1, bunt button 2, steal button 3 (and direction). All of those controls are easy to use though. :) Pitching and hitting are fun Season mode with stats Choice of 162 games in a season, 82, or 51. (Yes season mode appears to work now so far. the relief pitcher bug is now fixed. :) MLB rosters Sounds of the crowd are pretty good, they cheer when they should; sounds cool when someone hits a homerun as well Games can be played in a reasonable amount of time. I lost 6-2 in my first season game and it lasted around 45 minutes. It took me 1-2 exhibition games to get used to the controls, but they are pretty good.  Minus: Fielding is a bit tough at first, but you can set it on assist which means the fielders do the fielding and you do the throwing if needed. Graphics could be better No Myplayer, and no trades.  Mouse control in the menus (or at all) isn't supported; have to use keyboard or gamepad. There are a few bugs I ran into like a pitcher fielding the ball in the 12th on the mound, and he couldn't throw or move. This only happened once so far though.  Overall: Pick up this game if you want a decent MLB game, and you want to support PC sports games.",

Warning: it really requires an Xbox controller (you can play with keyboard, but it´s very difficult).  If you put as field assisted (or something like that) it gets easier to get the ball in the field.  Roster with actual players.  You can play season with different lenghts, many configurations, different stadium. A casual game to enjoy. Bought it on a promotion.",

If you want one, this is not the game you are looking for, BUT if you are looking for a simple arcade baseball for fun, a way to spend some time, lamenting on the licensing deals that destroyed sport simulator genre on PC, this is a very nice game for it.  Seriously though, while R.B.I. Baseball is far from MLB The Show, or MLB 2k12 (which I still play frequently), it is still kinda fun. And, I hope it is the step towards finally getting a full baseball sim on PC.",

            "review_text": "I'll start with saying that I remember the original RBI baseball. The gameplay in a singleplayer session of RBI 2015 is largely on par with that experience, which is okay. There are a lot of additions I want in the singlepalyer experience, but I it wasn't lacking anything it promised on that front. So if you want a singleplayer experience, it will probably be okay for you. Not too many bugs.  That all being said, I wanted a game with good multiplayer. What I got was a game with TERRIBLE multiplayer support. - The games frequently don't start - games crash out with regularity, and can't be resumed - When pitching; the baserunner icons on the HUD disappear with disturbing regularity (multiple times per game) - when batting: if the opposing teams pitch hits my batter, but I've started a late swing it counts as a strike. This is bad because the animation only looks like I've lifted my leg, not made any swing motion - sometimes when fielding the ball, I can't throw it. Play literally will not progress to the next batter until all base runners are sent home - fielding is terrible. I can't seem to allow the AI to control that in multiplayer, where there is an option in singleplayer.",

This is not made for the PC, it's just ported for it (the PC) and not very good at all, in fact, it's a terrible port. The controls are dismal at best, gameplay and physics seem right out of the 70s-80s arcades where you pop in a coin and play. This is a dollar store game at best, where no item costs more then 1 dollar.",

I thought that I could ignore the small things in hopes of playing a baseball video game when I bought it. Turns out I can't. Frustrating. I hate to be mean, but please save your money if you are considering buying this game. Even for 10 bucks. Not worth it.",
