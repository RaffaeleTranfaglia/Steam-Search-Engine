Its not a very polished game, but the core gameplay is a unique and fun concept. This is also a short game, with 12 stages in total, but they are all varied and often throw in unique concepts/gimmicks for that level. Expect a lot of catchy theme tunes. I'd say it's definately worth buying.",

            "review_text": "Tadpole Treble is an atypical rhythm game that puts you in the role of the guardian angel of a small tadpole named Baton who, through a series of misadventures, finds herself seperated from her home and family mere minutes after she was born. Against the backdrop of a treble-aligned sheet of music, you must dodge incoming obstacles (which are usually notes directly from the background music) and collect points and bubbles (currancy) in order to survive...and make a high score, of course.  This game absolutely charmed my face off. There's so much character within every nook and cranny of every stage, and even the menus and extras have a lot of love poured into them. Clearly this was the work of someone who was developing a game that they absolutely had the most profoud respect for, and poured every bit of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ soul into.  For a price of $10 (I got it when it was on sale for $7), this game promises exactly what it's going to give you; a quirky adventure through music and life that is infinitely replayable through the game's 'Compisition' mode, which lets you create your own stages once you've 100%ed the game (and that alone is no easy feat). I've heard that some people have some difficulties sharing levels, but at least you can show your friends your musical aptitude and level design locally.  If you're looking for something different, charming, and honestly fun, please give this game a try.",

            "review_text": "[Disclaimer: recieved this game as Kickstarter campaign reward]  Tadpole Treble can be described as a cross between Audiosurf and (fittingly) Frogger. Audiosurf because it's a rythm game that's not based on QTEs (like Gutar Hero), but on moving your character between different contiguous lanes containing obstacles or items. Frogger because there is a very wide terrain (13 lanes, as opposed to the 3 in Audiosurf), with obstacles occasionally crossing the screen at different speed. This is, I think, Tadpole Treble's biggest strength: there is more space for more complex and path-based level design, and in turn that creates more space to experiment with different strategies.  For this type of game, good level design is vital to its success. Thankfully the Taranto bros. (developers) managed to create 12 memorable and distinct levels, where getting high (and low) scores requires just the right balance of dexterity and pattern memorizaion. Every level has 5 associated medals: one for finishing it, one is a 100-bubble collectathon challenge, one is for level-spcific challenges (e.g.: not getting damaged, not collecting health pickups, touching or attacking specific elements in a stage...), one medal for getting an S rank, and one for getting the F rank. This is a great idea, since it encourages to play levels with completely different strategies.    Obviously, a good base gameplay is also necessary for this game's success. In short, Tadpole Treble has a great base gameplay with just a handful of simple mechanics that accommodate for many different strategies. Here's a description that will try to give you an idea of it.  Like in Audiosurf, levels are based on collectibles and obstacles. Obstacles are mostly notes, sometimes stage-specific obstacles. Collectibles have a small impact on your score, and are mostly used for 100-bubble challeneges or other medals that you can get at the end of a level. There are also health pickups, and knowing their placement is vital to getting F ranks. Their placement in general is very good, in that sometimes they point you towards a safe path, or guide you through a zone with dense notes, sometimes they require you to choose between different types of them.  This game also has cymbals that you can hit, which increase your score multiplier and allow you to briefly jump out of the playing field. Usually it's necessary to hit them for S-ranks and 100-bubble challenges, but some levels specifically reqire you to use them in F-rank runs, where you have to balance out the multiplier by getting damaged as soon as possible.  There are very creative stage-specific obstacles throughout the levels: for example some terrain will push you out of a lane, some parts of the stage can damage you if you stay there too long, some obstacles are intermittent, and there are even enemies to destroy during a cymbal jump. Boss levels are especially clever: bosses attack the part of the stage you're on, and sometimes that requires you to take a risk and lure them in an area that is difficult to traverse.  Even basic note obstacles have a secondary use: as you dodge them, you will load the Treble Charge; when you activate it, the Treble Charge makes you able to destroy notes on contact, but not invincible to stage damage. To get a high score, you need some awareness of where in a level notes are more dense and decide where to activate Treble Charge accordingly. Similarly, to get a low score, you need some knowledge of the level to judge where it's best to get hit to reset your multipliers.    In addition to all of that, the game has a beautifully drawn art style (that you can see on the store page) and one of the catchiest soundtracks of all times (the trailer music doesn't do it justice, visit the Bitfinity youtube channel to hear some of the ingame songs). And while all of that is a labour of love in itself, the real labour of love on this game was the the act of not chickening out on gameplay, and instead of making it as immediate and throroughly enjoyable to play as possible, and in doing so (accidentally?) outdoing most existing rythm games.",

The controls are simple enough that young or inexperienced players can learn it easily, while some of the optional challenges provide an incentive for more experienced gamers to spend time learning how to fully exploit the mechanics.  The cartoony aesthetic is cute, the music is excellent (at least one song will get stuck in your head), and the game is full of good-natured humor. It's a lot of fun to play.",

            "review_text": "Tadpole Treble is a game about dodging notes and getting a high score. It sounds simple, and is. But the real fun of any music based game is in getting into the rhythm of a song. Tadpole treble has this in spades all due to it's clever level design. Point doodads and collectibles follow a certain flow, making the way you control your tadpole feel in time to the music. Each song has it's own art, events and theme which are seldom repeated and make each song feel unique. The music is written by the same guys who did the musical comics for Brawl in the Family (a now concluded web comic featuring Nintendo characters), you can find a few on YouTube if your are interested in sampling how good they are. It's a short ride, you could finish the game in a day if you power through easily and it's not difficult if you don't go for 100% completion, but it's a good one that I come back to occasionally for a few certain songs.",
