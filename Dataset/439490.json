I'm not particularly good at shoot 'm ups but so far this one has been a great experience, trying out the different weapons and figuring out the game is a lot of fun. Hard but good.",

The scoring is fun and easy to understand, controls are perfect and responsive. Plenty of options for PC, great visuals and sound design. A real blast to play. I lvoe shmups but don't often try to master them, but with Blue Revolver I can see myself spending many dozens of hours trying. Lots of great unlocks like skins, walpapers and arange soundtrack just by playing and getting stars for each run you try. I have never written a review for any game on steam, but I hope this one does well and gets lots of recognition. Shmup fans don't miss this one!",

It's a quality shmup and yet another one worth buying. Scoring system is unique and while memorization of levels takes you far, it's no longer the only way to reach a high score worth tweeting (get this, the game lets you upload your scores on twitter).  2 characters, 3 shot styles per character, 4 specials weapons per character. 24 different ways to play. 3 difficulties that manipulate the ingame difficulty scaling system.   Unlockable art, song remixes and color palletes with ingame stars you get per play.  It's worth the money 10/10. The soundtrack is amazing and I ought to buy it. If someone wants to gift me it that'd be great too.",

Most bullet hells make the mistake of making their easy mode far too easy to actually prepare players for the rest of the game(or genre for that matter). This one does not. There's also a bunch of missions that have you completing individual stages/bosses under certain requirements that help players learn the game.   The scoring mechanics are easy to learn and not punishing. With the extra lives you get from a good score, good scoring is essential to survival too. This forces some depth on a game that would otherwise just be about dodging and shooting when players aren't aiming for the highest score.",
