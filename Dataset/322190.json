Aiming and positioning are very important and I've had a lot of fun with the game. The dialogue is meh, but not the focus of the game really. This game is a pretty solid buy.   So, the reason I decided to write this review was because of the music in the game... I've just been sitting in the bar listening to the robut band play and they have what appears to be an original steampunk themed songs that are whimsical, but actually really pretty awesome. It's the little things, you know?",

            "review_text": "A fantastic turn-based strategy game with interesting characters, challenging missions and HATS!  I have only two minor issues with this game.  1) Weapon balance. Common weapons of the same tier generally deal the same damage, and this is an issue. Pistols have perfect aim while SMGs and shotguns do not. When all three deal identical damage on a direct hit it the pistol is clearly the superior choice in almost all situations, with the shotgun being the least useful. Only sniper weapons and heavy weapons are exceptions to this, due to the usefulnes of laser sights with the former and area damage of the latter.  2) New Game Plus. This is literally just a reset of the entire game, except you get to keep your crew members. I felt like this wasn't properly explained in the confirmation pop-up and I would not have started NG+ had I known that. A way to swap between NG+ and the regular mode would have been nice, rather than permanently changing my save file.  All in all still one of the best game I played this year. The Outsider DLC is also highly recommended.",

The only thing that could be better is if they could add some sort of multiplayer or coop, like Worms-style, that would make it a fantastic game.

            "review_text": "SteamWorld Heist had actually been on my radar for quite a while. Mentioned by Austin Walker on The Giant Beastcast podcast earlier this year, the phrase “2D X-Com” set my hopes high. Not having a 3DS, I had to anxiously wait for it to come to PC. Every month or so I’d looked to see if there was even a release date, until finally, recently, it popped up on Steam.  Made by Image &amp; Form, it’s been my turn-based tactical game of choice. These are the same developers who did SteamWorld Dig, which has the same aesthetic and charm, but is an adventure game in real-time. In Heist you play as a captain of a mercenary group of steambots (robots powered by steam). You’re a bit of a rogue with a heart of gold. The Han Solo of steambot piracy. It’s all presented charmingly in 2D, except for a couple of cutscenes. Each mission has turn-based combat also from a 2D perspective, and it takes some of the baseline mechanics from the recent X-Com series and repurposes them. The two mainstays are a cover system, and an action point system tied to movement.  Here’s the catch, where things break from X-Com or other turn-based cover shooters: you’re the one lining up your shots. No percentage based shooting, no hidden dice rolls. It’s all based on your ability to line up shots, in a very Worms-like manner, and have them connect. There’s a strong focus on being able to ricochet shots, in addition to using cover, which has a really enjoyable kinetic feel to it. I found myself turning my head to the side to try to line up shots. Pulling off a long shot, or a shot with a ricochet, is a blast of endorphins for me. It’s a “problem solved” moment, where a tactical challenge was faced and defeated.  Your character’s aim of each shot does ‘float’, for lack of a better term, up and down just enough to add to the challenge but not unfairly. There’s a level of anticipation while you’re trying to line it up. And while some guns have a laser sight, most do not. Not really a problem with close range guns like shotguns, but bouncing explosives and pistols each present a challenge and heighten the stakes.  Additionally, you also have a roster of characters that have different activatable abilities and strengths. And that last bit might actually be more crucial than I’m giving it credit, as it really added to my enjoyment in switching and exploring the different classes (for the most part — sorry Bea!). They offered enough variety and provided some different solutions to the missions you run into.  All of this has me actually considering a 2nd run. Most of that has to do with the tactical layer. The engagements were fun to solve and making those shots never got old. The missions themselves had enough variety, and the overall length was solid. I finished the game on the default difficulty level (Experienced) in 14 hours. Playing a couple missions here and there was easy and enjoyable, and while I was ready for things to end, I wouldn’t mind restarting on a harder difficulty. I didn’t find the story particularly engaging, but the bits of humor scattered throughout were amusing enough. The music was a mixed bag as the general background and battle music was a little too monotonous, but some of the songs you heard in the bars or at the end were great and brought a light-hearted tone. The visuals speak for themselves and the animations were well done and brought their own charms as well.  In closing, X-Com or Final Fantasy Tactics, this is not, and thank goodness. Not that I don’t want more of those games (see Arcadian Atlas for a modern hopeful at recreating the latter), but I definitely want turn-based games going in more directions. Using 2D physics is a fun way to mix the genre up. I‘d love to see this concept revisited, and possibly expanded upon.",

It's easier to spot treasures and targets with the map/radar on the bottom screen, although you can't zoom out on the main screen like on the PC version so aiming from a distance without lasersight is a bit harder on the handheld.",

But what I enjoyed the most is that this game is absolutely non-problematic in all ways! It's not racist nor sexist, which is a constantly disturbing and disgusting problem in almost any other game I've played. But this game is full of fleshed out female characters, and also lots of non-binary gender neutral characters as well! Not ONCE did this game offend in any way, which to me is extremely refreshing. The wonderfully spellbinding effect of a really good game is usually brutally cut off by some sexist aspect of the game, which reminds you that it was exclusively made by straight white men that do not realise their privileges. It's clear to me that this is not the case at Image &amp; Form. Either they are all aware of the social problems among us, or there is at least one among them that steadily kept sexist content out of the way.  This game was a breath of fresh air!",

            "review_text": " Steamworld Heist is simply a fun to play, and it hasn't gotten boring yet.   One of the main reasons this game has amazing replayability is that starting over is so dang fun for some reason. The New Game Plus option also allows you to start over keeping your... Well, I won't spoil too much, but it makes restarting feel even  more  fun. It's nice to go back to the basics after beating the entire game, especially since about halfway through, you'll forget what it feels like to not be overwhelmed at all times.   PROS:   Lots of things.    Turn based, but not: Although you and the enemy take turns shooting at each other in a very engaging bar-fight-shoot-out-esque style, you don't simply click on the enemy to attack. Well, I mean, you can. But what I mean is, you do the aiming. Some guns ricochet, some guns deal area damage, some guns pierce. This combined with the fact you have to manually line up your sights with the enemy makes it feel much more immersive.    A wide cast of characters: Some people will tell you that some characters become useless at some point, and some are too over-powered. I partly agree. Some characters are practically essential to have late-game, and it becomes pretty obvious that not just ANY team comp will work. However... That said, the characters all have personalities, which are great. Sometimes, after a mission, you can talk to them back on-board and learn something about their past, or their character. Additionally, bringing certain heroes to certain missions prompts dialogue that you otherwise never would have heard. It's up to you to figure that out. Oh and, when I said I partly agreed, I said it because I don't really think any hero becomes  totally  useless. Some characters become more viable, but this doesn't neccessarily mean the rest of the crew becomes useless. If you want a challenge, or are just genuinely attached to a character, by all means, use them!    THE GRAPHICS: My gosh, the scenery, the characters, the background... It's all beautiful. I've never seen another game company make something in this exact way - Not to say it's the best thing ever, but it's absolutely gorgeous most of the time, and feels refreshing. Even the dark, gloomy interiors of the Scrapper ships (Don't worry, it's not really a spoiler. They're literally the first enemies you'll encounter.) will take your eye off the battle once or twice... or twenty times... In one level. Not to mention the detail they put into the cosmos, which is always present in the background, and most of the time covered by the level you're on. Take time to look around, you'll find it worth your time. Mainly because of the aesthetics... And there's some nice little easter eggs and quirky things to see!    The story: This game made me think it was going to be really short. And then there was a non-specific thing that non-specifically happened that changed the story to a non-specific degree. I'm trying not to spoiler much. This also happens a non-specific amount of times. In a non-specific order. Needless to say, the story will keep you glued to the game for your first run-through, and likely for the next couple of times as you find more and more you missed the first couple of times.    The sounds: This may sound minor, but believe me it's not. When I say sounds, I mean ALL of them. Of course the music is great, if you've played Steamworld Dig you'd know that. If not, I'm telling you - The music is great. But it's also the little things, like the enemy bots falling apart and their parts clanking on the ground a few times before finally settling, the richochet of bullets off metal, heck, even the robots  talking  sounds awesome! Trust me, you'll know what I mean when you try it.    The feeling of growth of your team: This is sort of a weird one, but if you're one of those people who  loves  watching your roster slowly grow in power and ability over the course of a game, this game really makes you feel good about it. The benefits of leveling up range from a minor health boost or passive, to a huge turn that makes the character totally different from everyone else. Exp grinding is also NOT A PAIN AT ALL. Seriously. To get all characters to max level, you might have to run a couple levels a couple more times than usual. But it's fun to do that! And you can totally beat the game without maxed out heroes, so don't even worry about it unless you really, really want it (Like I did). Oh, and there's an achievement for it. So yeah.    HATS! HATS HATS HATS! This game has hats! Lots of them! In fact it's almost a joke! Shoot hats off of your enemies to get them! Buy hats! JUST GET MORE HATS! Haaaats!   CONS:   (Wind howls, and a tumbleweed made of scrap and barbed wire flies across outer-space...)  Well not entirely. Although there are a couple things that nag me, and might nag you. For starters...     This isn't the case for me, but I can see how it can be for others - Repetativeness: This isn't the case for me, but I can see how it can be for others - Repetativeness... In all seriousness, there's enough character diversity and most but not all levels are randomly generated, so this shouldn't be too big an issue... And like I said, there's not much grinding involved, so a new level will probably feel... Well, like a new level! But I can certainly see how it can get a liiiittle boring for soooooome people. But trust me - Odds, are, it won't be a problem. At all. Take a break from the game now and then, and the urge to come back will slowly creep up on you.    Weapon diversity: For the most part, and I won't lie, new weapons are usually just upgraded versions of the ones you already had. Which is fine, except... There's not many weapons that AREN'T straight upgrades to ones you already had. Sure, different heroes use different types of weapons, but outside of that, each type of weapon usually only does 1 or 2 different things, at most, depending on the type. Oh, and there's some nice quirky 'rare' weapons that change it up, but like I said, you'll probably find a powered-up version that will eventually turn it into nothing more than a collector's item... Which leads me to my last 'con'.    Inventory space: There ain't much of it. You're gonna have to spend a LOT of water (in-game currency, go figure) to upgrade your inventory size, too. It's a pain, sort of. Grind a few levels and you'll be filthy rich again, though. I guess the whole 'new weapons are just upgrades from the previous ones' works with this system, since you're probably gonna want to sell the old weapons anyways... It's just... I wish there was more. You have to check your inventory and sell stuff every couple of missions. And I'd like to keep those rare collectible weapons just for fun without compromising my time sifting my inventory of junk and duplicates. But this is a minor issue, if an issue at all.  And... That's all! I gotta say, this game blew me away. I knew Steamworld Dig was fun, but it's not like it was ground breaking (Tecnhically speaking, it was, but you know what I mean). If I'm being totally honest, I wasn't sure how well they were gonna pull this game off. I was a skeptic. But as a skeptic does, I completely took back my word once I saw the evidence (Disclaimer: Some skeptics are still too stubborn to do this). By that note, if you're skeptical about this game too, I understand. People tend to read a bit more into the Cons of a game review than the Pros, and take the Cons much more to heart. But please, for your sake, don't. Don't second-guess yourself on this one. If you like any of the genres, or liked Steamworld Dig, or anything Steampunk/Robot related, or shoot-outs, or space, or just great game design in general, do yourself a favor and buy this game. Wanna wait til its on sale? Why not? Only means you're getting a game worth well more than its price tag for cheap.  Highly recommend.   ",
