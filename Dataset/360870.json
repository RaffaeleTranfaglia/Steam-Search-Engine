            "review_text": "It's tic-tac-toe. Noughts and crosses for those in the UK.  This rendition is a free indie product, so at least it has that going. The base game's also free if you have pen and paper, so there really wasn't a choice regarding pricing if the developer wanted to stay competitive on the market. I genuinely dig the freeware aesthetic it has going on, sort of like something you'd find on a '100 Games!!' CD that actually cared about itself. I find those collections pretty damn sad, though, so I'm not aware of any that actually do.   As I said earlier, this is tic-tac-toe. If you actually find someone in multiplayer, or invite someone (to find you in matchmaking, of course, since there's no discrete room creation here). you essentially try to make them screw up. If you play against the computer, you set the difficulty to easy if you want any outcome that isn't a stalemate, and even then it's not guaranteed you'll not stalemate.  There's new variations of the game, which is where things get a little crazy. The titular 'ultimate' mode replaces every square in a standard tic-tac-toe board with its own little board. You try to mark the little boards and win them to make a mark on the big board. The crucial thing here is that you're not actually told that marking the top, middle or bottom of a small board dictates where the next player has to play on the big board. In this case,  you actually need a tutorial to play tic-tac-toe , a tutorial that you'll only find in the  community guides . It also doesn't help that the variations in small board color that let you know whether you can play there or not seem to be designed to frustrate colorblind people and those who use any sort of screen dimming whatsoever.  'Forget' mode erases the last move made that's four moves old. It's interesting until you realize that it basically means any mark that would let you win is erased so the AI can eventually win instead.   The Steam achievements - for a tic-tac-toe game, I will remind you once again - include ones for various flavors of winstreaks and for reaching 'level 50'. They also don't work in classic mode for some reason, but I digress. The worst thing about this game, really, is that according to the minimum requirements it won't run on Windows XP. That's a bit more flattering: this game is also like something you'd find on a fresh install of XP, except not quite as polished.  Despite the detached, sarcastic tone I affected throughout this review, there's genuine value to be had here. If you know someone, whether a Steam friend or an offline friend you communicate with long-distance, who you'd like to mentally wrestle while you ♥♥♥♥-talk them via Steam (because I'm not sure this game even has a chat feature), this is for you. If you're a masochist who thought chess against Deep Blue's extended family wasn't painful enough, you'll like it too.",

            "review_text": "This will be a review of 'Ultimate' mode tic-tac-toe. The normal mode tic-tac-toe is as you would expect, and whilst the provision of full 'ChalkFX' graphics and 7.1 surround sound with high quality samples of chalk on blackboard do fully immerse you in the experience, that is not what I will be delving into in the space of this review.  No.  You see, 'Ultimate' tic-tac-toe is a game within a game. It is tic-tac-toe within tic-tac-toes, and it requires you to think several moves ahead of your opponent. The rules are simple. You start with nine 'Cells', win a cell and your 'X' or 'O' takes over that cell, construct a winning line and you win the game, as with normal tic-tac-toe, but to do this you have to win the smaller games, nine smaller games of tic-tac-toe being played *at the same time* against your opponent.  It's brilliantly simple, and the sting in the tail is the rule, the move you make determines which 'cell' the opponent must place their move, and consequently, their move determines which cell you must place YOUR move. Thus the game elevates from simple matters of trying to get three in a row in one given cell to attempting to maneuver your opponent into a position where they are forced to place a symbol in an empty space in such a way that gives you access to a cell that allows you a favorable position, or you might play defensively and play what seems like a nonsensical move, or even throw away a winning line, but in doing so prevent your opponent from gaining a decisive victory.  This isn't tic-tac-toe anymore. This is chess. It's chess at breakneck speed, it's a strategic knife fight that takes no prisoners, and ramps up in tension, two -good- players can quickly become entangled in multiple complicated dances with several cells on the cusp of victory or defeat and then a game of hopscotch ensues as each player tries to maneuver each other into a position where the opponent is forced into giving ground.  And it's free. Emphasis -  FREE   Find a friend, someone who likes mind-games, invite them for a game of 'ultimate' tic tac toe, get a hot tasty beverage, and prepare to lose an evening as you engage in what will be the most tense evening of strategy that ranks up alongside the very best games of Chaos Reborn and X-COM.  ... and it's Tic-Tac-Toe. What has this world come to.  Recommended, may Gaben have mercy upon my soul. I have recommended tic tac toe.",

It's fun with friends and definitely worth checking out. I mean um...Instead of paying for paper, which is pretty expensive, I prefer to play tic-tac-toe online with two gtx 980's instead, so that's pretty cool...  Better than Grand Theft Auto V, Battlefield Hardline &amp; Just Cause 3 combined.  It's a masterpiece and it adds the skill and flavor that was never there before. 10/10 Would recommend this to any next gen gamer.  If you don't get this game you should kill yourself.",

You only get achievements for playing the ultimate mode.  It was overall well designed but it is so hard that it takes the fun out of TTT.",

You may think its a simple tic tac toe, but holy ♥♥♥♥, the bot cheats to win, not once did i beat the bot without it cheating by winning with only 2 moves or something. Like i think this game was created to torture prisoners at Guatanamo Bay, it makes you want to scratch your eyes out as the game laughs back at you, taunting you with every loss. I would rather spend my time playing Superman 64, at least i could have the joy of winning. Sticking my tongue into an electrical socket was less painful than this, this monstrosity of a game. I'm pretty sure this game caused me to get a migraine the size of Texas. Whoever made this game is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and deserves to have tic tac toe played on their ♥♥♥♥ing chest, with razor blades, until they bleed out. Holy hell, ♥♥♥♥ this game to damnation.",
