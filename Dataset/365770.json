            "review_text": "Half puzzle, half stealth game. Kind of reminds me of the Metal Gear Solid VR missions. I played through the first 40 levels before I realized how much time I spent at it.  A few notes: - The game takes critical thinking and tactics to escape/evade the guards. If you have them already it mostly comes down to timing. If you don't you will get the chance to work on them provided you work through the frustration. I have a pretty good ability at looking at a path puzzle and figuring my way through it without really thinking. Useless gift, but it is one of only a few talents I have. :D - That said, you will often really need to think outside the box. Find a spot where you can use a distraction long enough to run behind a guard or through its line of sight to evade/escape. Some of the early levels escaping isn't always viable, but later on when the levels with twists, turns, and obstacles, it is. - Decent voice acting, and I am actually intertested in the story progression. Speaking of which, if you start a new level, or perform an action which splits some narration it will start the audio conversation over. Generally it seems to be at a decent point, not rehashing several sentences back. - Controls, both keyboard and controller work well. - UI and graphics are pretty smooth; no graphical issues so far. - I have not come across any bugs either. - I can't seem to find a way to see your personal best time on a mission without entering the mission. Maybe it is there, but if it isn't it definitely should be.  I got this a while ago and wish I would have played it sooner! If you are into this sort of thing I highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Volume is a slow and patient game, and is rarely frustrating. What it lacks in difficulty, it makes up for in quantity: none of the levels posed much of a challenge (the only time I was over the 'par' time was when I was listening to the story bits), but there are 100 levels in the 'Core' story. Beyond that, there are tons of user made levels, and you can find the best through the Staff Picks section.  The pacing of the story does feel a bit drawn out, largely because there is so much content in the 'Core' story - you get conversations every 5 or so levels, and you can't just sprint through levels to get more of the story. This makes getting to the continuation of a cliffhanger conversation a little tedious feeling.  Volume also controls brilliantly with the Steam Controller - it has minimal button interactions, but being able to use the right haptic pad as a mouse, while the rest of the controller functions as a Xbox controller, is very useful. The grip buttons also mean you can re-bind actions to a more easy to reach/easier to hold location (I moved the 'use cover' command from the trigger to the grip, as it needed to be held).",

            "review_text": "The Bithell, Wallace and Housden trio have created another masterpiece. Just one that's a little more rough around the edges this time...  The gameplay has both quality and quantity, with it being fun, addictive and challenging but also with thousands of user-designed levels ontop of the 100 story-based ones. It feels more like a puzzle game than a stealth game where instead of thinking 'How am I going to get to the end without anyone seeing me?' you're more likely to be in the mindset of 'What tricks am I going to have to use to get through this segment while collecting all jewels?'. This is mainly due the massive variety in gadgets and the general robotic nature of the AI as none of it feels natural or at all realistic. Course, this is a video game so none of that matters...  However, this means that the gameplay and the story do not fit together perfectly as the story banks on you seeing the gameplay as hyper-realistic. However, moving past this, the story is incredible. It takes the already classic tale of Robin Hood and runs with it before completely turning it on it's head. It knows when to be quite, dramatic and hilarious with fantastic performances from Charlie McDonnell, Danny Wallace, Andy Serkis and a few other brilliant performances that I promise not to spoil ;)  The soundtrack is perfect, from something quiet and atmostpheric to incredibly loud and epic. I could listen to it for days and I probably will. This is where the game definitely surpasses  Thomas Was Alone , Bithell's previous game.  All in all, it's a 9/10 as opposed to Thomas Was Alone's 10/10. It is a different game (though does have a fair amount of nods and winks, don't you worry) and the studio is obviously moving on to new things but the fact that story and gameplay didn't fit each other kept it from surpassing it's predecessor.  TLDR: It's not Metal Gear Solid in terms of stealth meets story but it captures all the british charm, humor and charisma that you need for a fantastic video game.",

This game is excellent, with good stealth mechanics and a good plot. And it sets the scene well as some dystopian version of Britain.  Considering the last game these guys made was about 2D quadrilaterals, this is an astounding transition. Tools and gadgets are great. However some repeat (with minor changes made to them) but some are fun to use, espicially the ones that stun the guards that were a pain in the ♥♥♥ before you got it. Soooo satisfying to electrocute them. And I found it surprising to be listening to the usual banter between the two main characters when Dan Bull suddenly started rapping in game, so it was cool for the creators to reach out to him and make a song for it. In short, Volume is a ♥♥♥♥ing beautiful game that I enjoyed immensly, and if you like the casual stealth games, this is one I recommend for you to buy.",

            "review_text": "I am a die hard Metal Gear Fan and Volume takes alot of inspiration from the stealth aspects of that game. The levels are however, way tinier than Metal Gear's (except for mabye the VR Missions) and movement is a bit more limited ( you can't go prone or look in first person ). Each level has the objective of collecting crystals to open up the exit, so it really is more of a guarded maze than a mission, which is a different tone than Metal Gear.   All that being said, it's a fantastic and really fun game that I think really is unique to itself and probably shouldn't be so compared to Metal Gear. There's plenty of challenge and frustration but it's never overwhelming. The visuals are suited perfectly for the game and the controls are nice. I would definitely recommend this game for it's uniqueness, fun and simplicity.",

            "review_text": "Volume presents a great core of a stealth/puzzle game without providing any real reason to play other than you can. There technically is a story, but it doesn't seem to matter or really inspire.  The aesthetics are interesting though can be as distracting as helpful with certain color combinations (neon yellow and white being pretty terrible).  The game itself really plays as a game rather than something that feels organic. It makes enough sense in the context of a 'simulator' as the game is framed, but that takes away from my attachment to the game or characters. In the end, it feels like a semi arbitrary collection of levels you're just getting through for no particular reason.  The levels themselves tend to be of pretty high quality. The standard interactions aren't anything that intersting (crouch along walls, make a distraction, hide somewhere), but the gadgets you get to play with do make that more interesting.  Though technically the puzzles can be solved sometimes in multiple ways, any differences feel arbitrary. The only real reason to replay would be to complete faster which comes with a high score list and little else.  The core mechanics are really good even if the controls (targetting with gadgets) is a bit touchy. Though on the fence about whether or not to recommend this, I do come down positively because I found myself just wanting to play one more level because some do feel like great fun. Others (many) feel rather boring when taken as an actual game you're progressing through though.",

The gameplay is solid, it combine puzzles with stealth and does it in a way that's fun and exciting. The story in this game, while rather minimal, is told through notes and excellent voice acting. The soundtrack is superb and changes depending on whether you are hidden on not.  What I really like about this game is that during the levels, various characters talk to eachother and create a human element, that most puzzle/stealth games miss.  It has 100 'core' (story) levels and a virtually endless amount of community levels, and you can still create your own.  The story lasts about 6 hours and while that may seem a little steep for the price of (currently) $20, it is well worth it.  Buy it if you love puzzle/stealth games. A must-buy when on sale.",

Most of all, I never felt challenged by this game, there's nothing demanding logic or wits. Only reflexes, memorization and trial and error. On the contrary, I see that someone can be into this type of gameplay. Just don't make a mistake assuming there is something puzzly about this game, how it's written in other reviews, just scroll to the top and read the tags: 'action', 'stealth' - very descriptive.  Story is very flat and totally rudimentary, which is bad, because if it was good, I feel I actually would have been able to drag myself to the end.  # Update After thinking about it a bit more I changed my view on this game. I came to realization that this is not really a stealth game at all. Indeed it has some mechanics, but I understood what kind of feel I got from this game. This is actually a pure platformer with some stealth mechanics duct taped to it. It sounds really strange, but stealth here really feels like a substitute to a jump button and guards are just pits you fall in. Creator's previous project was a platformer, and even his game in a completely different genre is still smells of platformer.  Old part of review is still legit, but I removed recommendation for stealth fans.",

            "review_text": "As a fan of Thomas Was Alone I was excited to see what this game would hold. Seeing returning voice cast along with what seemed like a neat little story concept, an interesting art style and so forth, this had the hallmarks to be another indie darling of a game.  How wrong I was to be truthful.  First I have to say the voice acting, especially on the main character is awful. It's nearly jarring. The computer isn't nearly as bad but the line delivery seems to lack a certain punch to it. The performance feels phoned in which is disappointing. There is a wealth of text based snippets on the floors, these in some cases are quite funny, and I can't help but feel we've been done a disservice by not having them also voice acted.   It is impossible not to compare the writing and acting to that of TWA, and if you compare the first few levels in each game there is a vast vast difference in terms of things to pull you in. Volume simply has nothing to compel you, the early levels are literally a tutorial with very little story direction or real concept of anything other than learn this thing. You are given literally no context at all during the opening segments to why you are doing anything other than a computer told you so, and not in the Portal kind of way. In the drab, this is the game kind of way.  The gameplay itself is typical isometric stealth gameplay. That's it. Obviously it has this level editor and so on, but there is nothing more to it. The absence of story or any driving factors early on means there was very little reason for me to continue playing past the 15 minutes or so that I was actually playing. The game touts '100 levels' But the first level is literally walking to the exit and the ones that followed were equally simplistic with next to no dialogue. 100 levels is only a real number if each level is significant content, the first 5 at least were nothing but saying 'look! stealth game!'  The art style as well, when actually playing does not feel like it adds to the experience. For such a minimalistic experience it actually feels overly busy and complex. details such as toilets to flush on the walls etc... aren't particulalry clear features to pick out until you stand next to them and get the text box in some cases.  It might sound like I'm being overly scathing for having played so little, but this is the age of the steam refund system and the significance of first impressions of a game has never been more apparant with so many games on the market. I am simply not compelled to delve any further because I have not been given any reason for anything I was doing.  A final irksome point is the random phrases spouted by the main character when collecting gems. Some of the phrases harken to elements of the story to do with gaining popularity and noteriety, however none of that has been discussed in the game thus far, yet he is spouting the phrases none-the-less. This dispels all immersion that could have existed.  I'm sorry mister Bithell but I donot think this game is worth £15, to me it has a much less compelling opening than TWA, the voice acting and writing is poorly done on all levels and there is simply nothing here to suggest it is anything but a generic stealth game. I'm sure I could be wrong, but I don't see a reason to delve further. Putting in my refund request now.  --Additional--  On reflection I believe I should add a few things here for clarity and fairness. At it's core it's a stealth game that works and that much is true, but it's not a stealth game that is worth £15. You can see where your money goes on this one, and it's pretty much on the graphics and voice actors which seems very silly when they are probably the least engaging parts of the game. People who like this game will like it for the stealth and the level editor, but those wanting more substance will be left confused and bored.",
