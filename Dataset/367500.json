            "review_text": "Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a Western-inspired Japanese action RPG that on the surface appears to be little more than a rather middle of the road game at best. The setting is instantly familiar and tired, with well-trodden dirt paths, castles, and the usual selection of character classes, monsters, and grubby peasants. That, however, is only part of the story. Below that well-worn surface is a game offering enough new ideas, mechanics, and surprising turns to keep even the most jaded RPG fan keen to see what lies beyond the next rise. The destination may not always be what you would hope, but the journey is often fascinating, and seldom quite what you expect.  Dragon’s Dogma doesn’t come with one of those fancy ‘remastered’ tags that we’ve been seeing so much of lately but is instead a straight port. Having come out for the PS3 and XBox 360 back in 2012. While it is, in essence, the same game as you knew back then, Capcom have decided to take full advantage of today’s graphical advancements to upgrade the visuals… if you can run it. You’re able to run the game in 60 FPS, which is incredibly impressive, but you are also able to completely unlock the framerate. It is also 4K supported, so if you have the kind of equipment to do these kinds of things (I do not), the game is going to look stunning.   The story places the player in the boots of a created hero. The creation tools have enough power to create something that resembles a human, maybe even close to what you look like. It’s very similar in style to tool creations in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim or Dragon Age: Inquisition, but don’t expect going into this game with a character creator from some of the latest massively multiplayer online role-playing games that have those amazing detail character creators.   For any single player RPG, the story is the skeleton that everything rests on, and sadly what’s here is the weakest skeleton I’ve encountered in an RPG in a very long time. In the opening cutscene, your village is attacked by a dragon, which promptly kills you and devours your heart. You awaken to discover not only are you not dead, but are now the Arisen, and fate has destined you to do great things. World changing things! Things no other can do… you know the rest. Hardly inspiring stuff despite the obvious desire to make it so, and sadly that holds true for the entire game. Thankfully, once you veer off the beaten path, Dragon’s Dogma will reveal not only many hidden secrets, but a fascinating and wonderfully crafted world that you will want to explore.  The real colour and detail of the world is found by talking to the various characters populating the landscape, many of whom will provide interesting titbits or useful quest information. This is important, because Dragon’s Dogma is not about to hold your hand and lead you to your destination. So exploration and conversation are vital to completing quests, and unlike many modern RPGs, starting a quest does not mean you’re up to the task of completing it. Rather than being frustrating though, harder quests always feel grounded in the world’s reality, and emphasise your place within it.  Your player character is able to choose between nine different vocations. Some are standard variations of traditional fighter, rogue, and mage classes, and others offer more advanced options, mixing and matching abilities from the more traditional class types. With “discipline” earned through levelling up, you purchase new abilities and attacks, and access to new vocations. You can change between unlocked vocations from an inn at any time, and most passive abilities will carry over between classes. Your vocation level is counted independently of your character level, further encouraging you to experiment with new builds and abilities.   Each of these classes allows a unique playstyle in the action-based combat, which is the game’s greatest strength. Different enemies obviously have different weaknesses, requiring you to change up your tactics based on who or what you’re facing. Using various abilities and managing health and stamina consumption gives the game strategic depth approaching that of a more traditional turn-based RPG, while the action itself is fast and exciting, owing to good movement options and animations that make every attack feel immediate and impactful.   And that’s just when you’re fighting normal enemies. The true highlight of Dragon’s Dogma are its encounters with big, mythical monsters: trolls, ogres, hydras, chimeras, griffins, and yes, dragons. With obvious cues from Shadow of the Colossus, you can jump on and climb these creatures to get at their various weak points, while carefully avoiding their attempts to swat you away. Grabbing onto a griffin’s feathers will give you an easy hold to strike its head, but the monster could easily take to the skies and shake you loose, causing you to plummet to your death.   These encounters are exciting every time they happen, and slowly scaling the back of a cyclops to plunge a dagger in its eye was just as satisfying 20 hours in as it was the first time. My only complaint is wishing there was more - more encounters, more variety, and more scale. The creatures are huge, but the only truly massive creature is the game’s final boss, which provides a multi-stage, truly epic encounter that I would have loved to see more of.   Also, you do not walk this world alone. Your party of four will consist of three Pawns: one custom made Pawn of your own design and two recruits. Pawns reside in a realm known as the Rift, and devoid of emotions or a will of their own, they are bound to the Arisen and will follow his or her command without hesitation. Even so, finding that perfect combination of warriors, rogues, and spell weavers to aid you in your quest is vital. The only real irritation with the Pawns is their lack of distinct personalities, and their all too soon repeated inane commentary as you wander the world. Thankfully this can be turned off, but the lack of interesting party members is something that follows you just as obviously as the Pawns themselves.  While the two recruit Pawns are essentially disposable, your own Pawn remains at your side for the entirety of the adventure, and will level with you and adapt its behaviour based on how you play. This is important, because just as you can recruit Pawns, other players can recruit yours as well, and all custom Pawns can be recruited from within the Rift to join another player’s game.  Recruited Pawns earn experience, knowledge of the world, and loot while in another player’s party, all of which they will bring to realm of that Pawn’s creator. This asynchronous online functionality gives you additional reason to make the strongest and most appealing Pawn you can: you want your Pawn to be hired because not only will it become stronger, but sometimes it will provide your party with something unexpected and uniquely valuable.  The overall presentation of the game is fantastic, and looks awesome on PC. I found the game ran perfectly at 1080p with consistent 60 fps. The game has plenty of options to play with, which include HDR, textures, anti-aliasing and other features that improve the experience. It still looks like an old game compared to some of the recent releases, but it still holds up fine. The world is full of interesting characters to talk to, and many quests to take on. I also really enjoyed the whimsical soundtrack, that added a feeling of magic and fantasy.  Dragon’s Dogma: Dark Arisen mixes the well-worn and overplayed clichés of the genre with just enough new stuff to keep things mostly fresh. Its story may be completely disposable, but the world itself is fascinating. It also has the honour of being one of the best-executed ports I have ever played.",

            "review_text": "A hidden gem of a game. It has a lot of flaws, but what it does right more than makes up for them, There are lots of little mechanics that all add to an overall sense of adventure and role-playing that few modern RPG's can compare to. Also, you get all the DLC with this bundle. This is also a really good PC port, but I think it is best played with a console controller.   The bad -Pawns are silly. Their AI makes them good for little more than packmules or meatshields. Don't give them any valuable curatives.   -no dodge mechanic for all the classes. Only one class has a dodge move, eveyone else has to ackwardly jump out of the way of attacks they don't want to eat.   -Really bad UI. The user interface is really bad. Managable, but bad.  -Long walks from point a to point b. This is somewhat helped by the fast-travel system, but traveling across long distances can be a chore sometimes.   -No co-op. A co-op mode to play with friends would be amazing.     The meh -Predictable monster spawns. This can be annoying to encounter the same monsters in the same areas, but if you need to hunt that one type of monster, you know where to go.  -The story. Not great, not bad, just good enough to make sense.   -One save file. You can get items to change your appearance and start the adventure again once you beat it, but you're stuck with your stats forever. Equipment will really be what defines you in the late game and new game+, but having the ability the make stat changes without starting over would be nice.  -Not much variation on landscapes and monster design. There are lots of monsters, but many are stronger reskins of things you've fought before with a new trick or two. Landscapes could also do with more variation. 60-70% of the time, you'll be wandering through a forest with pine trees. The rest you'll spend in caves, swamps, and ruins.    The great -Best character creator I've played with in a long time. Customize everything from your height to your voice! Want to be short, tall, skinny, or fat? Go right ahead! Want to make a dwarven giant-slayer or an kid-sized wizard? You can! Want to have Shrek adventure alongside Harry Potter? You can! It's so easy to use to. Simple menus and plenty of templates allow for easy use.   -Play dress up. Armor and clothing are layred on top of each other and allow for some very unique outfits. Also, capes, lots of capes to flow majestically in the breeze.   -Class-based warfare. Unlike most modern openworld RPG's, you class matters. Play a warrior and channel your inner Guts as you cut down entire packs of monsters with sweeping blows from gigantic weapons; or take up the mantle of the fleet-footed strider and scale gigantic foes to strike their weakpoints. Or just be a mage and hang back to heal your team and enchant their weapons.   -It's dangerous to go alone! In the early game you'll die if you don't bring a few pawns to support you. Monsters often attack in huge packs and giant foes will bite your head off. You'll also need specific elements to attack specific foes. Magic is the only way to hurt ghosts and some foes need physical might to bring down.   -Action packed battles! Climb up giant foes to punch them in the face! Put smaller monsters in a head-lock so another member of your team can punch them in the face! Unless you're charging up a spell or a skill, you're likely moving to attack or get out of the way of an attack. Even some ofthe biggest monsters will be constantly on the move, requiring you to keep up to be effective.   -Lots of little machanics to keep you on your toes! Weight management is key, the heavier your load, the slower you move. Unlike other games where you only have two speeds, overburdened and not overburdened. Dark nights and darker caves will make carrying a lantern key to sucess. Make sure to carry empty flasks for any interesting liquids you want to take home, bring picks to mine, and be sure you've got airtight containers to preserve foods as they ferment to their restorative peeks. There are a bunch of little things to keep track of that other openworld RPG's would omit for the sake of mass appeal.   -Big, open world. This game world is huge. You can explore just about anywhere you like, but chances are you'll get one-shot by monsters if your not careful, or if you stay out during the night. Night is dangerous too. The undead rise and ghosts and worse will prowl the lands.   -Amazing boss fights. Tackle monsters of all size and shape in thrilling encounters. Flying beasts need to be knocked out the air and armored giants require powerful attacks to stagger. Also, the best Hyrda fights around.    ",

            "review_text": "(Repost of my Amazon review for the PS3 and 360 versions plus an extra final paragraph. As a result I won't mention any PC-specific technical issues, if there are any. Sorry about that. Might edit it in the future to include this.)  This game seems to have been misunderstood and unfortunately underrated by a number of gaming journalists. It's very hard to explain because it's actually a pretty unique game, but you can think of it like Dark Souls meets Skyrim if you want a really lazy way of summing it up. That doesn't do it justice at all, because here we have people that have worked on games such as Resident Evil, Devil May Cry and Breath of Fire all coming together to deliver an incredibly atmospheric and compelling action RPG.  The story follows your character, who shortly after being created by you - with an excellent character customisation system - has his or her village attacked by an enormous dragon. After an ill-fated attempt to fight it, your heart is ripped out and eaten by the colossal dragon. Yet, somehow, you're still alive, albeit with a huge scar on your chest like Sagat. You can also hear the voice of the dragon in your head, urging you to track it down if you want your heart back. Then it's down to you to make your way in the world and find him, though your village is still reeling from the attack and many of the side quests are based around this, rather than some guy just wanting 20 mushrooms because he has in inexplicable craving for fungus all of a sudden.  Shortly after this, you're introduced to one of the game's most interesting systems; the ability to design pawns - AI warriors who you can program in fundamental ways to be the most useful sidekick for you. The really interesting thing is that other players of the game can rent your pawn off you. You keep your pawn, but a copy appears in the other players game and goes around helping them. Everything it learns, like how to defeat certain enemies and how to solve certain quests, will be remembered and when the player returns your pawn, it will be able to help you out with all its new info. And of course, you can also rent other peoples' pawns off them. Renting them uses Rift Crystals, an item that is commonly given out in game for completing quests, though pawns of people on your Friend List are free.  There's an interesting and varied character skill system, made all the more fun and addictive by the fact that the real-time combat is made by people who worked on Devil May Cry. It's not quite as exuberant as those games, but you can see the understanding and professionalism of those guys at work in this game's combat. Really, if you like games where you explore, go on an adventure, never know what's around the next corner and can expect a firm challenge from any enemies you meet (the larger ones can be climbed up, like in Shadow of the Colossus), and all in an open world with tons of secrets and hidden areas, you will love this game.  This is an RPG where you feel like you're on a genuine adventure in a world that resists your exploration, not just following waypoints and brainlessly turning in quests. This is an RPG where the world around you feels lived in and ancient, not just like a series of neat corridors or barren fields for you to traipse through on the way to the next generic kill quest or cutscene. It has that powerfully mysterious feel that Dark Souls has but in a wider, more open world and with a lighter atmosphere overall so it's not quite as oppressive as those games can be (this is both a good and bad thing according to taste, of course). Quite simply, I honestly can't imagine any RPG fan (who's not averse to action gameplay) disliking this game. Even if you're an RPG fan that doesn't like action gameplay, I implore you to make an exception this one time. In my opinion it's one of the best games ever made.",

I don't want to make this a long review, there's already lots of reviews out there, I'll just say a few things:  Remember when you first started Oblivion, and got out of the first maze after the death of the King/Duke(whatever)? The feeling of lots of things in front of you?   Or when you started Skyrim, and got out of the cave? A world full of possibilities. Those exact feelings are in this game. A world for you to explore and own, thousands of stories to hear, enemeis to slay, and bosses to kill, apart from lots of sidequests, of course.  Graphics are nice, not the best, but they're really pleasant and fit the world. The soundtrack is ♥♥♥♥ing amazing and I'm going to get it in my pc right now. Sound effects are magnificent, every slash or hit feels real thanks to the effects. Story is a slow burner and most of it takes place near the end-game. Gameplay is ♥♥♥♥ing 10/10, Skyrim pales in comparison.  Honestly, if you liked Skyrim/Oblivion, RPGs, and long games, just get this game, it's a masterpiece and deserves to be played.

But the big difference here is that fighting a dragon (or any other beast for that matter) ACTUALLY FEELS LIKE YOU'RE FIGHTING A DRAGON. One big thing that put me off of Skyrim is the fact that the so hyped up dragons were little more than just huge walking hitboxes with no life to them at all. This is where DDDA is doing it right. Dragons and other large beasts have their own unique body language, it takes more than just spamming magic/swinging your sword all the time while gulping down potions while not moving at all from your spot. Monsters in DDDA are agile, cunning and getting hit by them will make you fly. The Monsters react ver clearly to your hits and so do you. You can cling to a griffon while it's about to take off and send it crashing down by making it flinch while flying. You can destroy specific body parts of monsters to weaken their range of movement and attackm or to get rare loot. Burn a Griffon's wings and he won't fly. Kill the goat head on a Chimera to stop it from casting spells. ",

A must have 4 year old classic that ages very well with its current art style and hopefully will be for the days to come.  Pros:   Pawn System( When each player starts the game, they not only create their own charater. but a side kick that will not only help the player but also travel accross other worlds to aid other players accross the world.)  Rift Credits( When a players pawn is rented out by another player, they earn rift credits and gifts from other players, which they can spend mainly on the dark arisen expansion for epic gear, as well on other ods and ends at a certain encampment early game. Because of this, you should equip your pawn with only the best gear, so people rent out your pawn more, therfore gaining the player even more rift credits.)  Combat system( Between the many different switchable classes at anytime, and the ability to climb giant monsters, and nighttime being really dangerous for a newer player, plus the solid combat it self, Dragons Dogma nails the combat department on the head.)  Lots of gear and loot( especially with the newely added dark arisen expansion, soooo manny chesstsss)  Story is kind of a toss up, overall, the concept is really cool and I guess very well implemented in a americanized japanize way?  Enviroments are really really cool and imersive, but basic.  Music is pretty awsome.   Cons:  Lip movment is nothing to sing about( to be fair it is a older game)  Story is a toss up, it has a lot of alternate endings and such. A personal opinion really.  Alot of basic go do this and escort quests. However, there are still some very long quests with rewarding story and gameplay leading up to them.    Overall a really solid game which saddens me to see around 200 negative reviews for such a awsome product, come on guys lets up those positive reviews!!!! ",

            "review_text": "Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen was not a title I ever heard about, nor one that I was wishing to buy as I normally steer clear of these types of games. However this was an expection, and probably one of the best I have made with games.   From the very start, you can feel this game is close to alot of other titles in features and gameplay, namely Dark Souls. However it also grabbed my attention in other ways, such as the landscape, soundtracks and general feel of the game, that made it feel a bit like Zelda in those aspects, which was quite suprising.   Getting down to the game itself, the graphics, I wouldn't say, is 'stunning' but the scenery is very beautiful and the way certain locations are compositioned gives it alot more quality. Character customization is fairly lengthy if you chose to edit the facial, body, stance and voice features of your said character, though it felt a bit lacking, in that certain customizable things such as the hair and body could have been expanded upon.  The gameplay as I mention before, feels alot like Dark Souls so not much to be said there. The animation most of the time is fluid and looks p. good. Though the apparently 'battle defining' feature of climbing a creature to get to its vital points feel more like someone went and modded it into the base game, as it produces some strange character placement bugs when climbing certain enemies.  The soundtrack and audio fidelity of the game is p. good in my opinion, having alot of customization in your characters voice, the soundtracks adding alot of character to many of the areas and the overall effects are nice.   To sum it all up in basic -/10 format;  Graphics (Objects, meshes, textures): 7.5/10  Combat: 8/10  Sound: 9/10  Storyline(obviously haven't finished yet): 7/10  Overall, I think this game deserves a 8/10 because it does feel very nice to play, look at and listen to. If you enjoy hording loot, farming monsters, completing quests, working your way towards a main questline and playing with an interesting AI and Combat system, then this game is probably for you :).",

            "review_text": "This game has to be my favorite Action RPG or game of all time, But it's impossible to decide the latter when you play so many games  The improvements from the original console versions include somewhat better textures (NPCs actually have faces? They were black blurs to me!) and no letterboxing, there is also the option to mute pawns if you get tired of them, There's probably more stuff I can't remember now. As for content the game comes with the base game and the Dark Arisen expansion which brought balance changes, new items and a new explorable area which I didn't get to explore on console but I hear it's pretty difficult. A bunch of the armor and weapon DLCs are also included, you also get the eternal ferrystone which allows you to teleport to portcrystals but doesn't disappear after using it. However there is some content missing from the original version, the main menu theme song, Into Free, japanese voice over and the armor sets from the manga Berserk  The game tries to be an open world game but it remains mostly linear, getting too immersed in exploration while straying out of the roads might make you feel otherwise though, most of the scenery consists in mountains and forests, there is only one city (pretty much your base since it's where you change classes, get most missions and where the  masterworks weapon shop is) but there is also a small fisherman village and a couple strongholds and ruined castles out there, and of course there can be no medieval fantasy RPG without dungeons or caves  So, you are a normal person living in a fisherman village and one day a huge dragon comes from the sky and attacks, you fight it but it steals your heart, the physical way and you become the Arisen and can command warriors known as Pawns who obey your every command  Into the gameplay, you have a light attack, strong attack and then by holding your trigger buttons you can use your skills, can equip up to 6, simple right? It is for the small enemies, when you are fighting cyclopes, chimeras or drakes you might want to climb on them ala Shadow of the Colossus and start poking at their weak points if any. A big component of the game are the Pawns, they are indeed your fellow party members, but they learn from you, from how to do quests or what are enemies vulnerable to to imitate your behavior, if a pawn sees you holding an enemy down, they will start doing so when playing a melee class, the most common imitated behavior will be how you climb and where you attack big enemies. You are the hero of this adventure and as such if you die it's game over, but if they do you can revive them infinitely, you have your main Pawn and can hire 2 more from other players, of course, expect them to be pretty talkative, they say important stuff however  Like most RPGs, Dragon's Dogma has a class system, there are 3 classes with 2 tiers each and then 3 hybrid classes (Arisen only) the classes are fighter (sword &amp; board) warrior (greatsword, 3 skills only), mage (healing, support and minor attack magic), sorcerer (offensive and devastating magic like meteors and tornadoes), strider (daggers and shortbow) ranger (daggers and long bow with a focus on longer distance and stronger arrows) assassin (sword/daggers + bow/shield), mystik knight (swords/maces + magic shields/staves, unlike fighter, MK shield skills are more based on parries) and magick archer (daggers + magic bow/staff, homing, bouncing arrows). To unlock classes and skills you need to earn Discipline Points by killing monsters, you can change classes at the Gran Soren inn for free after you unlock them so no need to feel pressured, when you gain a character level your stats growth will depend on your active class, for example you gain more stamina as strider but more magic as mage, however it's mostly about the gear and the level cap is 200 (stat gain halves from 101-200)   In conclusion, this game is flawed and probably even rushed but it's well worth a try, it has action based combat, bg monster climbing, good archery, manual spell aiming mages and can summon huge meteors, what's not to like?   ask the people who bashed it for not being Skyrim, but they probably didn't even play it    ",

            "review_text": "Where do I begin, to put it simply this is one of the greatest RPG games I have played in my entire life.  Dragons Dogma: Dark Arisen, for those who don't know, is the same as dragons dogma, practically. But containing all the Downloadable content. Now Dragons dogma itself came out in 2012 and is still regarded to this day as one of the top of the hierarchy rpg games. You begin your journey as a colossal red dragon comes to your miniature shoreline village and ravages through the area, you quickly take an attempt at felling the beast only for it to take your heart; but you survive. Although the idea is, well, a little monotonous for an RPG; they almost always include dragons and the like, it still creates a really well developed game and provides some beautiful gameplay.  Dragons dogma is well known for its learning curve, this is like a combination of Dark souls and skyrim. It can get tough and you will actually need to level. You cant do it like skyrim and breeze through as bethesda holds your hand, you will learn to fear or fight or you will die, especially at night. Capcom said they had wanted to develop a game that really made you feel vulnerable, and at night time in dragon's dogma you really feel that. Monsters roam everywhere and all you have to guide you is a puny light coming from your lantern, the rest; black. Another major feature I love about this game is the combat; at first the combat can seem pretty bland as you have to level to unlock skills and such but once you've gotten to said level you can pull off amazing looking combos and leave your enemies pretty much trembling with trepidation as you slay their comrades.   Something I love most about this game (Yes I'm devoting a paragraph to it) is the fact that you can climb your foes, yes. Climb them. Capcom threw in a Shadow of the colossus feature into the mix that REALLY kicked it up a notch, and im not even exaggerating. Roam around on youtube and watch the game trailer and you will see what I mean. You can climb onto a dragon WHILE IT'S FLYING and hack the living ♥♥♥♥ out of it with your sword, daggers or whatever (That's how you do it skyrim, get your ♥♥♥♥ together). With huge bosses this mechanic is just so fun to play with, it feels so thrilling to be climbing up the back of a cyclops desperately trying to reach its eye, or scaling a golem to destroy that last amulet.   Now unlike most, if not all rpgs, there are two major functions of this game that really mix things up; the first being the pawn system. The pawn system is something completely original and it's that you have 3 'pawns' as followers, 1 main pawn (who you create and all that) and 2 support pawns that you can obtain from online friends or just people anywhere. Through entering the rift with online connectivity you're able to easily hire other players' pawns and transverse between them quite simply, and when you're done you can even send a gift to the pawn's owner and rate them depending on how well they look, how well they fought, and how helpful they were.  Another large feature of the game is something else completely original and unthought of, and that's NG Plus (New game plus). Pretty much what NG Plus is, it's a mechanic that lets you almost infinitely level your character. So once you've finished the main story most games would just, end, right? Well not Dragon's dogma. If you load your game after finishing the main story you can restart the story all over again, but you'll have the same level, same stats, same equipment and everything. allowing you to play through the game as many times as you please to get your Arisen to the level cap (200), which in itself takes a fair amount of time.  Dragons dogma is something I will always carry in my heart with me, no matter how much I play I can always seem to come back and feel some enjoyment off it. I mean, who doesnt love hacking at a griffin while it's flying off somewhere? I would recommend this game to any RPG fan or someone who just really likes to kill ♥♥♥♥. It is the most fun I've ever had.  -Moxi",

            "review_text": "This game started with such potential. My first few hours of the game were very positive. The story seemed fairly unique and told well, the animation and graphics seemed quite clever, the ability to climb atop larger monsters to fight them or grab smaller enemies seemed pretty cool.   The game really doesn't hold up much after that. The game world seems quite large, but truth be told it is just a series of large open spaces loosely filled with monsters or bandits that respawn every fifteen minutes or so. This means every time you go through the area you have to fight the same enemies every time. While this is annoying it is hardly enough to make me negatively rate the game.   As I mentioned above, the game offers different ways to fight monsters. You can shoot out the eye of a cyclops or climb his legs to root him, attack his arms to disarm him, which seems pretty cool at first. Very early on however, you realize that the game sports a relatively low roster of enemy types with the same enemy reoccurring frequently. This means most battles are exceedingly similar to the last. The first time you scale a Chimera's back and cut off the snake tail, break the goat head and then finish off the lion head? Interesting, pretty cool and fun. The third time? A little tiring. You see where I am going.   The story was the biggest let down. As I mentioned, it starts off very strong, being tied together with cut scenes and interesting characters, different types of monsters and quests being thrown at you to emphasise the danger of the world and how you can influence it by taking action. Once you reach the Capital city however, the story slows down drastically. Cut scenes become few and far apart, instead of returning characters whose story may develop, you instead are offered a series of throw away characters that have so little time on screen you neither care or are aware of them when they die. The bulk of the middle to end story segment of the game is going out and doing what feels like a series of fairly dull side quests that only loosely tie together to produce the end result of finally fighting the dragon.   The mechanics of the game also seem a bit clumsy after a while. It is very easy to lose something in your inventory as it is poorly sorted, weight capacity seems relatively low, most armour and weapons in the game look fairly bland and similar to previous pieces and advance classes are essentially the same as your regular class with the exception of access to a few new abilities.   The Pawn system starts off as interesting, you essentially create a companion character that follows you around acting as your side kick, but who actually does all the talking for you and won't shut up about 'I've learned more about this monster.' 'Wolves!' 'Ah the Capital' and other unhelpful pieces of information. You can reduce the amount they speak, but I can't help but feel you are either forced to listen to every observation about everything ever, even if you have already heard it, or having your pawn so little it feels like they are nothing but background detail.   The RPG elements of the game seem lacking as well, with precious few choices to be made that might influence the story. Truth be told it is only a role playing game in so much as you can choose what to wear and what class you go, but these have little real bearing on anything.   All in all, the game is fairly average and probably is a game you won't regret missing.  Update:  I, for some reason, decided to go back and replay the game recently. I will firstly admit that I enjoyed the game a fair bit more the second time around, but still rate it poorly.   Even after managing to find a few new quests and fight a few bosses and stuff I had missed the first time around (apparently I had missed a whole rather large canyon full of gargoyles), I still cannot help but feel somewhat cheated by the previously listed complaints:   The story starts off good but then fades into nonsense. Coupled with the fact that the Dragon, the main antagonist for most of the game, is hardly present. You don't even fight his minions or generals or anything really, he flies in, steals your heart, buggers off, you hunt him down because that's your heart (not having a heart apparently makes you eternally young and gives you legions of free minions to choose from by the way) and he can't have it.   The pawns won't shut up and seemingly turning their speech off only (as far as I could see) effects YOUR pawn and not other's you summon forcing you to either listen to two people shouting the same stuff constantly or travel in near silence.  The enemy roster is relatively small, so you very quickly feel yourself trapped in a game full of repetitive dialogue fighting the same enemies with the occasional variation of their skin.   Large, rather empty world with every major landmark miles apart from the next one with very little in between save packs of wolves, goblins or bandits for your pawns to scream about.",

The Pawn system is a unique companion system that allows you to share your companion with other players to help aid them on their quest and help your companion learn to handle different scenarios. The class system in the game allows you to enjoy the game however you want whether it be archery, greatswords, magic, and more.

Spells/skills feel amazing to use, even the non-magical ones.  Very agreeable price. They could have taken the ubisoft route with this one, I'm glad they didn't.  Very good combat mechanics. I dont feel bored, even when fighting smaller mobs instead of the bigger baddies.  The game runs smooth as silk.  Open world without feeling completely copy-pasted.  Berserk references.  Exploring is fun, because:  Players that stick around and explore are rewarded with loot from hidden chests.  Holy f*ck did the dragons turn out to be hardcore.  Very likeable main adversary. I'd invite him to a party.  Finger of the Maker.  The first quick-travel system I could appreciate in an open-world game, as opposed to the skyrim way of just teleporting everywhere you have to go.  You can romance anyone that isnt the duke or your pawns. Anyone. You're a masochist? Aelinore. You're a masochist. but also a paedophile? Symone. You like fat, hairy, corrupt merchants? Fournival. Would you like to cuck the duke? Aelinore. Annoying french muscle-girl? Mercedes. Annoying french muscle-guy? Julien. Hobos, knights, peddlers, kids, pensioners, they're all ripe for the taking.  CONs:  Too little gear. The best gear availiable is more often than not the gear in the shops that unlock at certain points in the game, and that takes out a lot of fun out of the looting (pre-bitterblack).  NG+ isnt harder.  Pawns feel kind of like autistic robot children with a hatred towards all things wooden, rather than actual characters. Several times in the story you're told of the interesting differences between the pawns and humans, and you get to meet some pretty cool characters that used to be pawns, but your pawn? Nah, he's just telling you for the thousandth time that wolves hunt in packs or how humans have a lot of expressions. This is more just my opinion, but it kinda irked me.  Gee, thanks game for not telling me that this seemingly pointless escort quest for affinity-points would define just how sh*t my immediate future would turn out, gear-wise.  The characters expressions freak me the f*ck out. Half-life 2 had much better facial animations in 2004.  Extensive craftingsystem for arrows/heals/cure-whatevers, but not for gear.  Guts and Griffith armour taken out due to licensing issues ... ? The f*ck?  It doesn't look as good as it could have, even for a game from 2013.    Most of my gripes with this game are just nitpicking. The game could have been my perfect game with some slight changes, but it is still a very, VERY good game.",

The narrative at times seemed a little vague but it was vague in a way that made me want to read into what every character was saying. The combat is fluid and is definitely a hack and slash game, but there are some interesting elements the game adds to combat, my favorite being the climbing system, it allows free climbing over larger enemies, some of which have weak points on areas you have to climb to, however you can still just swing at the leg and kill them, in a less efficient manner however.

It has a very strong influence from that game and the developers also mentioned Fighting Fantasy gamebooks having inspired the artwork. It has a very medeival combined with dark fantasy feel to it.   The game features many addictive qualities like building your character and pawn, replayabilty, sharing pawns amongst fiends, exploration, romance options with NPC's, dungeon delving, dragons, classic D&amp;D monsters and a very immersive world due to the fact that fast travel being slighlty restricted when compared to other games. Combat is one of the best features in this game and is hands down the best (and funnest) in the genre. Once learned, it can almost compared to action games such as Devil May Cry with combos, thrusts, dodges and take downs. Climbing huge beasts also almost never gets old.   It's got flaws which prevent this from becoming a mainstream hit (expecially amongst review sites) but those flaws and the great features I mention above combine to make one of the most cult classic games of a generation.   This port is a fantastic job, the graphics are smooth (I'm running an older GTX 580) and many improvements have been made.   D&amp;D fans, this is a must own.

However I can say now, 'Boy, am I glad I did!' What a gem of a game.  Coming from a long line of experience in playing RPG games, Dragon's Dogma has been filling a need I have felt for awhile.  I love turn-based RPG games, but many times I want a game like Skyrim with all of its Action RPG elements. I thought Dragons Age - Inquistition would be the 'go to' ARPG for awhile for me.. but something about it was missing.  Dragon's Dogma nailed it perfectly and showed me exactly what was missing; a game that is gritty, dangerous, surprising and suspenseful - right down to being ambushed by everything from Wolf packs to bandits.  Outside of it's questing, one thing that is fun about Dragon's Dogma is it's Rogue-Like elements. You can start a new character, do the starting quest, and then just strike out and explore as you please. Sometimes I treat it as a Rogue like game, explore, level, get gear and just have fun.  While the 'No Rails' approach (outside of the starting questing from around level 1 to 10) is surely the greatest fun to me, you can and will get in over your head more than once, so be warned about this. You most likely will run into something that will give you a severe beating. Save and save often is the motto.  I love the Huge monsters you can come across while exploring. Nothing builds excitement like seeing a Huge, Towering Ogre, that is weilding a Cudgel the size of a large Oak trunk, that has a pack of Goblins about him. It is fun to listen to your pawns banter while you are trying to decide, 'Can we take him?'  The Pawn system is a blast, and I love that ascpect of the game. You get to custom make your own. Outside of that, you can pick up one or two other Pawns that other players have made, to join you on your quest. When someone picks mine, it is always exciting to see how they liked my Pawn. It is a personal pride to for my pawn to come back with a prize, 4 or 5 star rating, with a compliment. Likewise, I enjoy finding a well made pawn and sending back a decent prize (not a rock as I often get, even when complimented).  If you have been on the fence about Dragon's Dogma, read up on Pawn Inclinations, as that is a huge thing in the game and will be very important to your experience.  Also I have learned, don't hesitate to try different Vocations out.  The only thing I wish this game supported, was more than one character save at a time. Unfortunately, if you want to try a different character/pawn combo, you have to start over as it erases your former save.",

I also don't like how much running you have to do in this game because there aren't any real shortcuts. Yes, you do get a fast traveling item (that you start with in this version of the game) but you still have to do an absurd amount of backtracking and running around just to complete simple quests. I am also not a big fan of the quests in this game. Most of them involve running to some area of the map, killing X number of Y enemies, and that's it. There are also escort quests which, while entertaining the first few times you do them, get really annoying really quickly.

Because DD stands out in how many good things it draws from.  -Dragon Age. Dragon's Dogma is a singleplayer experience motivated in a party of up to 4 characters who asist you directly in combat, banter, shed advice to your main character, and heck, its a LOT like dragon age. Characters have far less, well, character. As 'pawns' they lack story driven personality but they still banter and entertain. You also get to personalize one permanent pawn and these will become a lot like a prized pet to you. I laughed and cheered when my pawn lept onto a hydra's neck and proceeded to 'sever the beasts head' only minutes after I had aquired her. Love at 1st blood. Pawns are very enjoyable npcs.   Combat is similar to a souls game minus the lock on feature. Unless I missed it... Its all free form hittboxing. Arrows are fired from 3rd person crosshair, very enjoyable. Skills are easily maped through your controller allowing for magic, dodge rolls, plunging attacks. Your character is VERY versatile and athletic but running out of stamina is a HUGE deal. The quest based action is cinematic and just amps up a new monster encounter.  Monsters are fantastic and plentifull. They have a glorious lineup of fabulous things to kill!  This is a singleplayer game and Nexus Mods is there for you.  Its a Capcom game... Its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ly hard if your like me and dive headlong into it. Classic Capcom example: Fight a pack of goblins and massicre their race. Cross a river of lizardmen and nearly die, exhasting all health potions. Slay an ogre 2 minutes after the river crossing. Fight takes 5 mins. Now its night. Kill 20 wolves just metres down the road from the ogre corpse and run headlong into a skeleton lord who one shots party members... Revive party and flee for our lives headlong through the night into an archlich who sumons MORE SKELETONS... ...Dive off a 200 foot cliff when my lamp runs dry in the dark of night.

I recommend it! explore, talk to all NPC's geez i have already 100h of playing still not sure how to please people here.

The only positive thing about this game is the combat system, which becomes a flaw by the end of the game, too. There is no targeting system so when you get more than 5 enemies at the same time you just can't fight efficiently and the thing becomes more and more tedious. The open world structure is just a way to make the player waste time since the map is practically empty and the fast travel is very restrictive. Oh and the player is mute so he's the farthest thing from a charismatic protagonist. At least the porting doesn't suck so I could play it with a ThinkPad E560.",

            "review_text": "I would say this game is a combination of Skyrim, Dark Souls, and a tiny bit of Devil May Cry in the mix.   Dragon's Dogma gives a very grand sense of 'exploring with a group'. You're never alone. But also, your ability to fast travel is limited. So you WILL be doing some exploring. And it will get annoying a bit during the begining of the game. I would recomend getting an Unlimited Sprint mod from the Nexus.  When you make your character(which is surprisingly deep), you also make your very own companion. You can also have other people's created characters in your party as well. Although they can be a bit...talkavtive at times. (This can be adjusted.)  The gameplay is in third person, very similar to Dark Soul's third person view. They move somewhat similar, having one button for light attacks, the other for strong attacks. But the combat is actually somewhat fast paced, with different comboes and special abilities. You can also grapple onto large monsters to attack certain weakspots like eyes or wings. This can lead to some crazy moments. Your AI partners learn. They learn from mistakes that mgiht hinder you. The game has different swords and maces, and they make you feel like you're doing damage. You FEEL it. Ver satisfying. The Magic in this game is outstanding. It blows Skyrim's and Dark Soul's out of the water. If you want to feel like a Grand Wizard, summoning tornados and fire walls, this is for you. You can be a Ranger, but not a true 'sneaky theif'. Archer combat is very fast paced and streamlined. No counting bows and you get all sorts of crazy skills. Realism is not what you're going ot find.  The story...is kinda...there. Dragon attacks a village, it steals your heart, now you're chosen one. but the game kinda challenges this. WHY are you the chosen one? Who decides this?  The actual story is not a huge element of the game. Like Skyrim, you'd rather jsut do side quests.   And I would actually recomended GREATLY to not rush the main story. Y Plus, there's the optional post-game/endgame area, Bitterback Isle. It is VERY hard.   Dragon's Dogma gives you a basic, but very grand sense of adventure. The game encourages you to explore and hunt the dangerous creatures around you. Every slash, bash and fire blast will have weight and you feel trul powerful.",

            "review_text": "This is a fantastic port, the game runs so fluid I feel like a senechal up in the heavens with a new smug reason to look down on consoles for butchering its potential. Coming from hundreds of hours of playtime on the 360, I was so hyped up to hear about the PC port and the wait was truly worth it.  Dragon's Dogma is a game that feels very D&amp;D inspired and the art style feels like Tolkien had a hand in it. The Dark Arisen expansion blew my mind with its new zone, Bitterblack Isle. It seemed to burrow a bit from the Souls atmosphere but improved the overall soundtrack and featured its own lore and storyline which overall is fantastic. The early game can feel very slow paced at times, but getting to this content is well worth the effort.  We also got the fabled infinite ferrystone, some new costumes and plenty of new hairstyles and such for those dressup lovers. There's no doubt about it, the character customization is quite strong with this one. And it's all here on the PC port! No 10k RC, though. Ugh. Once you beat the game you can buy the infinite scroll to recustomize as much as you want! Dressup lovers rejoice! Dragon's Dogma qualifies as one of those 'Flawed but awesome' types of games, not everything is perfect but if you can look past what isn't so great you'll really find yourself immersed in this game with hundreds of hours ready to blow. It's totally worth the money.  So what's awesome? The combat is fantastic, and steers away from some of those other mindless button masher 'ARPGs' out there. Bosses actually have mechanics. Chimera kicking your bum? Grab on to his goat head and cut it off preventing those annoying spells. Cyclops throwing his club around? Burn it out of his hand or paralyze him with lightning! Gryphon not landing? Throw a goblin corpse down or something similar and bring that jerk down, latching on to him and eviserating his entrails as he tries to take off.  The classes are really fun and really offers a load of different playstyles to the RPG lovers. The entire world and most of the items in it have their own innate properties which really adds a whole new layer of detail to the game. You can throw oil at enemies to make them take more fire damage, for example. The height and build of your character can affect this stuff too, heavier characters can carry more and have less trouble remaining attached onto enemies and storter characters may find themselves more mobile or able to fit in some small spaces that a taller character cannot.  What are the flaws, though? One thing is there's only one character slot per save, that's pretty annoying. There are ways around it, but wouldn't it be nice to have more characters that could access your storage to make leveling that second character easier? That's the 2nd thing that could be seen as annoying to minmaxers. Every time you level 10&gt;100&gt;200 the stats you gain are based on what class you are, and its permanent. So you may feel the need to plan your build ahead in advance, and it could lock you into a playstyle. You can gift via pawns thankfully, but still. I was really hoping capcom would have done something to ease this annoying part of the game. Hopefully mods and hex editing will open more options around it, but ugh.  The other thing is that the early game can feel very slow paced and cumbersome, the vanilla dragon's dogma didn't have the infinite ferrystone and there was only one Portcrystal per game. That probably costed the game a few positive reviews. The game starts out great, you get your heart literally stolen by a enormous dragon and he challenges you to beef up RPG style and get it back; The intro is quite strong. Then you pretty much end up being a kings errand boy for half of the game running around exploring and doing menial tasks, making the early game seem less appealing. Once you get far though, you'll get rewarded with some pretty awesome battles and dungeons. The showdown with the dragon is FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC. Then you're rewarded with a new dungeon with plenty of shiny loots and bosses including the Ur Dragon who you can challenge online to contribute your damage to the server. Remember Infinity Blade's Clashmob? Something like that. There's offline too. It's pretty cool.  Conclusion, this is one fantastic game. It's well worth the money if you're in the mood to try a new open world ARPG.  Brotip: The Wyrmking's Ring increases cast speeds by 15% just for being in your inventory, take it to the black cat and turn in the forgery! Don't turn the real one in!",

            "review_text": "Coming from someone who loves the Souls Series, this game is the closest you'll get to the combat system in Dark Souls, except with many more abilities and nuances to it. There are multiple ways that you can approach and beat every combat situation, and with the multiple classes the game, the variety of combat becomes exponential. Along with regular attacks/spells, every class has several abilities that they unlock by levelling. These abilities can be used to stun, buff, damage, heal, or avoid damage. These, along with the grab mechanic that lets you pick up and hold smaller enemies for teammates to finish off, or climb on bigger monsters ala Shadow of the Collossus, make for extremely diverse combat scenarios with multiple ways to defeat each enemy.   And along with the playable character's diversity, there is also a very different and very well done party system. In the game's lore there is this 'species' of people called Pawns, that are these almost subhumans that obey the Arisen/Player Character without question. The way the game uses these Pawns is that early on in the game you make your own personal Pawn that will be in your party at all times and is supposed to be your character's complement (a healer to your tank, a DPS to your support, etc) and can be uploaded online to be summoned by others to use in their party. In the same way, if you visit a rift stone in that resides in most towns, you can go to a Nexus-type area, that lets you pick your other party members from the online community. This is a very well done party system as it gives a lot more variety and lets you see other builds that characters have made.   The party system in combat is very unique as you have much more control and many more options than even a much newer triple A game like Dragon Age: Inquisition. In combat you can give orders to your party, such as to give you help or to target the enemy that you are fighting. And you can customize your main Pawn's personality to choose how they will treat combat situations. And along with giving orders, you can pull off tandem moves with your teammates, such as boosting a teammate onto a larger enemy, or holding a smaller enemy down to let a teammate kill them. And this just adds to the many, many ways to approach combat.  So, getting away from combat, the visual fidelity of the game is rather old, looking like a PS3 game more than a PC one. The graphics options don't really go too high, and the game's highest settings still don't have great texture quality and have some pretty noticeable pop-in. But, I do have to say that this port is much better than most. It doesn't have framerate issues or bad keyboard/mouse controls, so I would say it is a good port all in all.  The story of Dragon's Dogma is really it's weakest point, which is to say, not bad, but not a selling point either. While it has very cool set-piece moments and a fairly interesting version of the Hero's Journey, there are next to no memorable characters, since the player character is silent and the Pawns do not talk in cutscenes. When Pawns do talk, however, is every other possible option they have. The Pawns in this game talk non-stop, either telling the player what enemies you're fighting or commenting on the scenery. While some people may like this, and the ones who don't can turn it off in the settings, it is very annoying to me and it seems like they spout more useless information than useful. That's more of a personal gripe though. Overall the story can be summarized just by saying that it is lackluster.  One other thing I have to say that didn't really fit in anywhere else is that the open world and sidequests in the game aren't handled too well. The game just puts you in the world and gives you no indication of where to go and what quests to do. While this is nice that it doesn't hold your hand, it also really confused me as to where I should go and what I should do.  In total, it's a great game with some minor flaws, and to anyone who loves Dark Souls or Action RPG's in general. The combat is phenomenal, and it more than makes up for shortcomings in the game's visuals and story. I would highly recommend to buy this game and enjoy what it has to offer.",

Cloud saving support  Pawn NPC characters are awesome, say funny things, ask funny questions, and most importantly help tremendously in battle if you spec them right.  Cons -No multiplayer. Do not be fooled by the screemshots. You can simply use other players 'Pawns' which are NPC characters you assign stats and skills to. -No ambient occlusion implemented into graphics. Very surprised. Luckily you can force it through reshade. -Enemies respawn too fast, you can run up a hill and there is a bandit who stops you.. so you kill him.

This game has probably one of THE BEST combat systems/mechanics out there  - Good AI for followers, many will disagree, buth i just love how they are able to learn about monsters by witnessing you or another follower break the horn of a dragon, next time you fight the dragon, your follower will know to destroy the horn to weaken it.  - Good story, again allot of people will probably disagree, but i love the story. Getting your heart ripped out, venturing out to retrieve it, and at the same time fight some bigass cyclopses? YES PLOX  - The classes ( vocations ) are well done, allot of different skills to unlock, some which require certain equipment to enchance certain ability's. You can be a main class like fighter or mage, an advanced class like sorcerer or warrior, or a hybrid class like mystic knight ( best class imo ) or a magical archer. ( There's more btw )   - The dungeon Bitterblack Isle gives allot of new content, a new story and challenging enemy's. Being able to fight Death himself is already badass, being able to fight 3 dragon's at once is even more badass, being able to fight a former arisen as the hardest boss in the game with 2 forms, is just beastly.  - The leveling is great, like honestly, you have to know that leveling a mage or sorcerer will give you more magick at level 100, buth allot less HP and stamina, i made the same mistake. If you want to build a 5K HP Mystic knight, you better level a mystic knight from the start or a fighter.  - Overall good open world environment, offers allot of things to do outside of the normal questing.  Cons  - One of the few cons of this game, is the lack of attention it's getting.     If you haven't noticed it already, i'm a big fan of this game.

The transisiton from consoles is perfect with the 1080p and 60 plus FPS (I set it to variable and am getting over 100 FPS). Graphically it's still apparent this was originally a console game but its quite pretty nonetheless.   Interacting with the environment and characters is fun as most objects can be thrown, including NPCs and group members! LOL. There are herbs to collect along with all kinds of little secrets hidden in the geography of the open-world. Gold caches and chests of strange items I haven't found uses for yet.

            "review_text": "Great game, going to keep it simple for this one and just state the pros (who reads this anyways) and going into a little detail about the cons so if there is a sequal or something similiar these are the things I feel that need the most addressing to make it a more than viable contender against other huge open world games like the Witcher, Skyrim, etc.  Pros+  Dynamicly challenging customizable combat elements. Boss fights feel like boss fights, they are awesome. Pretty Large open world go wherever you like setting. Very customizable class system with the ability to change anytime at certain locations. Really nice graphics if tuned correctly Awesome port in terms of performance and the like. An insane amount of items and combinations for potions and gear upgrading!!!   Cons-  Hard mode: Though I enjoyed the challenge and only played it in hard mode it did feel lazily implemented. I read that the only notable difference to the combat is that almost everything can one shot you in the early game which is true and while I did enjoy mastering it,it was a little frustrating at times. You do lvl up twice as fast and later it becomes a little less of an issue though so its not all that bad imo. My suggestion is to not start in hard like I did. From my understanding it was designed originally for new game+ and im sure you'll have a much better time playing normal. I'm an exception as I really enjoy challenging games and barely if ever start in normal xP Just wish it did more than just change dmg values.   Skillsets- While not a con an extra skillslot or two per weapon wouldve been nice and added a bit more real time variety as apposed to having to go change them or your class at a certain location does.   Menu- You spend way too much time in menus, Even though the PC version enables you to bind 'certain items' (another con) to the 1-5 keys I doubt many people play this with M+K. It plays well and all but the max fov I think is 75 so expect to get nasious if close to the screen. Luckily for me I use a Steam Controller and I had those keys binded, otherwise i would've really hated it initially. It does get better once you learn your way around though so.... Yeah.   Story- The little story it has is... Well just that, very little and doesn't exactly encourage you to keep playing the game for the sole intent of finishing the story alone. Hell I completed Bitterblack Isle first. which is alot harder and meant for endgame content, before the main quest so that's saying something. It doesnt help that the few Major cities (1) it has feels pretty morbid and depressing at times for its lack of open door environments and npc interaction being set at its bare minimum. Immersion evidently not being the a main focus of this game.   Environment- While this game does feature some beautiful and open world environments you cant help but feel a certain emptiness when travelling along the same routes at times seeing as there is very little dynamic to it. The most obvious drawback being the spawns are always in the same locations with the same creatures and that can get pretty drab quickly if you like a bit of venturing as apposed to using fast traveling means alot. Making it very important that you place your ports in good locations and never too close because you only get a few, upside is that they're not permanent so u can move them around if you like. This method really would've worked better on a game like Skyrim with a lot more locations and overall dynamic feel. Anywhere, Anytime fast traveling is well... lets just say a love and hate thing xP  Items- An Insane amount of items! This one is also a love &amp; hate kind of thing. At times i loved just going in and finding at what ingredients I needed to create certain potions and which ones were well suited in terms of weight and all that, etc. I did memorize almost every recipe but bare in mind that it didn't come easy considering the huge amount of them. But jeez I think I spent about as much time if not more optimizing for weight, mixing and matching items, etc as I did playing the actual game. Like i said though I enjoyed it, its just that it had a bit too much of it maybe? Maybe...  Conclusion- If you can get past these cons its a really enjoyable awesome game and a must buy at its price point.",

The combat system feels very fluid, energetic and overall has a very satisfying feel to it. The open game world is pretty massive and it can be easy to spend hours exploring the game world just from wandering around to get to quest locations. My only gripe is that unless you look it up the pawn system and character stats as in how tall or heavy your character is, it is extremely vague to almost no info given on how it effects not only the player but the pawn as well. It can be very easy if you don't look up Inclination traits to create a Fisher Price pawn that will hold hands with you throughout entire fights instead of going in and attacking, which could be an issue. But that can easily be fixed in-game as well as looking the many guides and community posts people have put up to help newer players out. Overall the game has a unique play style to it with it's somewhat hard difficulty, random boss monster encounters throughout the world, Being able to clamber up to attack said boss monsters and a huge open world setting that you could easily sink hours into.   tl;dr: I recommend it highly if you enjoyed Dragon Age: Origins.",

The only thing I have a problem with in this game is the pacing and the fact that you feel so 'alone' although there are so many NPC's around you. The character's really lack emotion. I guess that and the 'go collect more of these to upgrade' system. Usually you found most of what you need while just playing around and I never did have to hunt for items very often but I feel the system could have done better.  Those are my biggest gripes. Everything else is nit-picking or me just wanting more, like a bigger world map so I could experience more of what this game has to offer.  Battle system is amazing, the combat is fun and can be really unforgiving. Sometimes you may run into an area where you aren't supposed to be but since the outside world changes as the story progresses, you usually won't see anything you are unable to handle at the given moment. Keyword usually.  The story is not terrible nor is the setting. But it is hard to get into due to character's having a total lack of emotional display. The story is at least interesting and in the end will make you wonder.  Even after you beat the game it has a ton more content to offer. The outside world changes and offers some new incredible beasts and this is where you encounter some of the stronger open world dragons. THEN you still have the DLC which you can technically go to at any point and don't have to wait till you beat the game but it is recommended. The Dark Arisen is basically one huge dungeon and unless you are just geared to the teeth it will be tough. It provides a lot of challenges the main game doesn't have to offer.  Overall amazing game. I'm pretty bad at getting my point across but try not to spoil the game for yourself. If you're going to watch gameplay make sure it's gameplay from within the first few hours of the game so you can get a feel for how it plays without having to spoil some of what you may encounter. The surprise in the initial encounter itself is one of the greatest feelings I have had playing a game. Really great set pieces during certain occasions.",

However, I was so excited for this game to come out that I'm going to act like a sellout fanboy for a second so as to explain its greatness.   (As an aside: myself and the DD:DA community would like to see a sequel, and a PC port 4 years after initial release makes us very hopeful.)  Including the PC version, I have purchased this game three times now, plus owning the art book. The original on PS3 in 2012, the PS3 GOTY edition just before my daughter was born, and now the PC edition which is has all the previous content and then some.   The best way I can describe the gameplay is to say Dark Souls + Monster Hunter. From Software's Dark Souls is my favorite game of the last decade (100% PS3 and PC, approx. 400 hours of gameplay), and though I've never gotten into Monster Hunter, there are some JRPG/MMO mechanics that are straight from that franchise (also, it's Capcom, so that makes sense).  The best way I can describe the world and 'feel' of the game? D&amp;D. This is the best analogue to Western-Fantasy role playing that I've ever encountered (heh, but all joking aside I enjoy ARPGs more than CRPGs, so you can argue all day the merits of my superlative classification). Say you want a full party of you and 3 dudes, balanced with sword-and-board Fighter, spell-slinging Mage, a Ranger who is all sharp edges, and a Warrior (i.e. Barbarian) who just screams, DBZ-style, at an enemy twice her size before her warhammer makes smashed-monster pancakes? DONE!   Say, instead, you want to just go it alone because other party members are too loud and their actions aren't predictable. Roll an Assassin and you'll get BONUSES to attack and stealth for being on your own, even more for sneaking around at night!  Want a mix of archer and sorcerer? Got that covered with Magick Archer (my favorite class)! Want a Paladin or Cleric, go Mystic Knight and get a staff as well as a weapon, and even cast magic with your shield!  The best part? All of these role-playing functions, like sneaking, fighting, and social interactions too, are organic. There's no explicit choice to join or deter a witch hunt until you question the angry mob. There's no 'Press X to Roll for Charisma' to charm, but you can give the shopkeep a token of your gratitude for his help, and next time he might give you a discount (or fall in love with you, which happens).   Want to back-stab that hobgoblin? Don't wear heavy armor, and move slower! Want to summon a tornado to rip that griffon from circling above and menacing your party on an escort mission? Chant a few arcane words and bring that fuzzy, feathered beastie down to your level!  Want to keep a resurrection item for yourself because it's a precious commodity and you're afraid of death? The blacksmith's dead son died because he's an idiot and you have no obligation to be a hero.   Want your Pawns (AI-controlled toons designed in and hired from other players' worlds) to rush to your aid, then repeatedly come close to death or run out of stamina. Would you rather they keep the enemies at bay while you provide support at range? Then give them melee weapons and good close-up skills while you kite.   Discover an enemy weakness that their master doesn't know? I can blast a wolf with a fire spell, they'll see its effectiveness, and report back to you the next time you find a pack. Did you take a different path on a quest than I did? They'll let me know my options if I have to do it again or even in the next NG cycle.  So I guess what I'm saying is, if you like ARPGs and want a pretty unique story and world to romp around in... Please do yourself a favor and buy this game.",

I really didn't like the endgame one bit though but there's a ton of content here and well worth a play if the above sounds at all interesting. There's not much else like it for good and bad.",

Vocation balancing is really poor toward end game Doesn't have enough monsters variety  Conclusion: Definitely a buy for any RPG fans. The combat is so satisfying and have a lot of play style to offer ranging from Two-Handed sword Warrior to Mystic Archer that shoot magical arrows or Paladin with well timed block that can devastate most enemy in one combo. Although I said that the game doesn't have enough monsters variety it's by no mean lacking, most of the monsters is always fun to fight due to combat system in game is extremely satisfying and rewarding.",

The game might have only one issue, it has a poor way telling you that you are about to engage an enemy who is far harder than you would thing... which can lead to some awesome escape attempts (Spamming F2 and running like hell :D ).

This is action-rpg heroine and you'll get hooked fast and for 29.99 at release for the game + all DLC and all console pre-order boni it's so good of a deal, it's practically theft.  Combat heavily influenced by the Devil May Cry franchise dropped into an open fantasy world filled with small monsters to bash and giant monsters to climb on. With fluid combat gameplay mechanics that can result in epic, cut-scene worthy encounters as you and your pawns (npcs) jump unto a strafing Gryphon and bash its head in while it tries to fly and flee to tragic comedies as one of your pawn gets picked up by a Beholder like Evil Eye and just thrown aside into a bottomless pit, like the mere mortal he is.  The Game offers you the ability to form a party of 4 characters, your alter-ego and three 'pawns' of which one is your personal, custom created side-kick and the others are recruited from players around the world. There is an abundance fo classes to chose one that can be changed on the fly at an inn if you think an encounter needs a different class combo or you just want to try out a different route to mix things up.  The world is open to explore to you from almost the start, but there are a few areas locked away until triggered by certain quests or story progress. The Story itself is probably one of the weak-points of the game. While it is enough to explain and fill out the world it's more of a background noise that is easily lost between all the random epic encounters. So of you're interested into RPGs mostly for story telling, you might be the only person I would not recommend this game to.  All in all, the package you get here on steam will keep you entertained for hours and once you're through the game NG+ and especially the harder content of the Bitterblack Isle DLC will keep you coming back for more and more.",

What happens when you combine the open world design of TES games with the gameplay and creature design from Monster Hunter? Dragon's Dogma is what happens. One of the best games from last gen gets a makeover and technical improvements, while adding all the dlc and expansion content all into one excellent game. The result is a game chock full of content and excellent 'hack and slash' gameplay.  Dragon's Dogma's basic gameplay and questing is more or less like your standard open world rpg. You visit towns, check notice boards, take on quests, kill giant monsters, etc. What sets it apart, however, it's the pawn system. The Arisen (Player character) has the power to invoke pawns, which are much like your traditional party members. You can fully customize your own pawn and they 'grow' as you play the game. You can also take on the pawns from other players online. It's a mechanic that seems to incorporate some ideas from Pokemon/Tamagotchi into developing a character. It's a very unique feature that should be used in more games.  The game is not without its faults. Despite getting texture and framerate improvements, the game's age is notable. Not only in the visual aspects but the mechanics as well. The menu system is somewhat archaic, players used to the latest games might find it a bit hard to get used to. That said, the gameplay is still amazing. Like I mentioned before, this game more or less combines the best elements of a TES game with the best elements of a MH game, the result is a very satisfying combat. Few games give you thrills like climbing onto a dragon to hack its head.   All in all, Dragon's Dogma is a gem. It's not for everybody, but for the audience that it's aimed, it's definitely a must buy.",

The graphics are slightly dated (Some textures are muddled or blurry) but the world is just so magical and expansive that it doesn't really take away from the experience. It has a very fluid combat system that really feels like you are doing something (Who doesn't like sitting casting a spell for 10 seconds and then watch 10 giant meteors pummel the area)  It is definitely not quite for the faint of heart though; with its 'Souls'-esque difficulty, it tends to punish you when you make a mistake. You'll be exploring doing a quest available to you, and then you'll be ganked by an enormous chimera out of nowhere. The key is to save often, and not be afraid to leave a mission for later.  Story is slightly bland on occasion but ALL of the side quests are relevent and actually portray better mini-stories in themselves. Each sidequest you do involves NPC's you've either met or had dealings with so it feels like a very alive world and that your sidequests aren't just for loot (Ahem.... Skyrim I'm looking at you!)   All in all a solid game that went under the radar when it initially released a few years ago. I am so glad that they decided to make one of the best ports available on PC and I wholeheartedly hope they make a second iteration in the franchise.   P.S.: This review is without even touching the Dark Arisen portion of the game.

            "review_text": "tl;dr: A better RPG and a better game than Witcher 3  Let's get the port crap out of the way first. DD ran like absolute garbage on consoles. It chugged to keep the framerate steady even in a normal situation and if anything cool happened, it quickly became a slideshow. An awful showing for Capcom's MT Framework engine, whose perfect performance mythos became a meme for so many people who understood nothing about it.  The PC version? Smooth as butter. I can't make this game chug no matter how hard I try. Dragon's Dogma finally plays like it should.  Dragon's Dogma is a game of contradictions. It's about the times where you are battling goblins in a field only for a griffin to swoop in unexpectedly and surprise you with a boss fight, but also about the times where you are fighting goblins in a field and nothing cool happens so you walk to the next field and fight some more goblins. It's about a hero slaying a dragon and saving a colorful fantasy kingdom and at the same time it is about none of those things. It's an open world adventure and then a closed copy-paste room arena fighter. Then it thinks it's Demons Souls for a while or something.  You have not played anything like Dragon's Dogma. What DD does, nobody else comes close to. Your character, and a party of three other AI controlled characters, picked from a half dozen swords and sorcery classes, go out and wail on monsters. No, no, bear with me. This isn't some Diablo-esque clickfest or Souls-style somersaulting knight-fighter. Everything feels visceral and just right. Powerful sword swings, flurries of arrows, wizards causing giant ice spikes to slam up from the ground, the rogue climbing the monster and just stabbing like a madman at the softest spot he can find on the creature... The combat here is up there with some of Capcom's most satisfying stuff. This isn't just an RPG where you are swinging at health bars, it's a bona fide action game. Every single monster in the game gets just as much care. They all have a lot of character, are instantly recognizable, and are satisfying to fight.  The problem is, almost everything else DD does isn't even as close to as good as the core combat. The world-craft and writing are charming, with shrewd merchants, crafty plotters, busybody nobles, a secret cult, dragons, knights, the church, a mysterious witch in the woods... the theme is spot on and yet... everything comes out kinda rushed. Quests aren't highlighted at all, and you are only going to find half of the story important side quests on a normal run, if that, without a guide. Which is fine enough because almost nothing you do has any real impact by the time the ending rolls around, which I shall not spoil but to say it is almost the video game equivalent of your DM suddenly having a fit of CREATIVITY during your D&amp;D campaign and ruining everything.  The world does not reward exploration (Which is another contradiction. In the original DD release, fast travel was not only extremely limited but quite expensive. You were expected to want to explore the world on foot. Dark Arisen's rerelease loosened the restrictions a little.). Chests and loot are everywhere, but you better be excited to find yet another flower that can craft with another flower on the opposite end of the map to make an alright healing potion that you just found in a chest anyway. Oh boy, another 30 second magic defense buff hooray.  Worse still, the leveling system is a huge part of the game, so before long you'll be leveling massive cyclops monsters in three hits, removing all the fun you used to have in those fights. High end play is almost completely busted as the class variety just sort of fades out to each class's most damaging engine. Crank it over and over and the game's toughest bosses are a joke.  Nowhere is this more obvious than Bitterblack Isle. BBI is the post-game content added into the Dark Arisen rerelease of DD, and since it is technically add-on content, the game keeps trying to tell you it's there despite every one of us playing on PC being way underleveled for anything on offer. Don't take that bait. Come back in NG+ after beating the story.  Where Dragon's Dogma reveled in the fantasy theme with a bustling medieval town and a grand overworld, BBI is just one dreary dungeon (Laughably, about half of the areas in this dungeon are copy paste and there aren't more than 15 zones total in the dungeon from entrance to exit.) filled with frightfully overleveled monsters, trying to catch on to the Demon Souls craze. Even some Souls-style 'just make another completely out of place knight and call it another enemy.' stuff arrives. A full on loot-grind slot machine system shows up here and here alone, and since this gear will be better than anything in the main story, it really does feel like a separate, uglier game.  DD's combat is fun and visceral, but there's not a lot of room for skillful play. So when BBI attempts to crank up the difficulty, the monsters spam instakill attacks (By this point you have so many extra life items, Capcom must be treating it as a joke.) and other such cheese and in response you just fire your class's designated overpowered move (or moves if you're a Mystic Knight.) and shred some life bars. At this point, outside of BBI's surprisingly fun bosses, the game has completely degenerated. The swashbuckling fun of the early game is gone, it's a simple, straightforward engine versus engine with occasional trips to the loot slot machine.  But despite all that, the parts of DD that work truly are incredible. Nobody as even attempted swords and sorcery combat like what Capcom has here. It's absolutely worth digging in, so long as you are willing to cut the game some slack for its silly parts.",

I love the story, the character-customization, the animations. the fight-system, the graphics... Also you're not forced to do the story all time! You're free in Gran Soren. And well... If you played the story like 20 times you need this freedom!  To be honest, I never understood why Dragons Dogma is so underrated.  I also think it's better than Skyrim, because Skyrim's animations are floppy, story is meh, character customization hurts in the eyes and battles are super boring! Also I'm not a graphic-♥♥♥♥♥ but let's face it: Skyrim is NOT a pretty game... Of course there're a lot cool mods! But Dragon's Dogma is able to be much cooler without mods.  (I also can imagine the mods that'd be possible for the Dragon's Dogma PC Version! That'd be sooo awesome!)  You literally can feel all the love they put into a game!  You can find a lot of enemies of the Greek mythology, which I think is pretty cool! c: The synchronization is pretty good even if you have to hear some quotes pretty often...

On the other hand, the aspects of this game that work feel so good that the faults seem almost trivial. The game feels like a perfect mix between western fantasy and Japanese game sensibility, a classic tale of knights and dragons with a twist rooted in an interesting meta-narrative.

Do you want to be the sneaky ranged who climbs beasts with their daggers and shoot down flying fiends with their bow? You can do that. Do you want to be Guts from Berserk? You can do that.

Despite that, there was no denying the chunky framerate, the bland, washed out environments, and the general lack of visual pizzazz, due to console limitations.  Since then, I've been pining for a next-gen sequel - or at the very least, a PC port. When this was announced, I just about lost my ♥♥♥♥: I had been waiting for that announcement for years. I couldn't have imagined what a stellar port it would turn out to be, though. Capcom has really stepped up their game here, and I couldn't be happier.  Notable Port Features:  - Customizable Keyboard and Gamepad controls - Lots of graphical bells and whistles to tweak, including an FOV slider (!) - Uncapped framerate (!), and stellar optimization (I am running this at 144hz/FPS on a 980ti, and it is a thing of beauty)  On the downside, there's no Japanese voice track, and the Berserk armor has been omitted - both due to licensing issues, which are admittedly out of Capcom's hands. But hey, it's not all bad - the English dialogue isn't terrible (for a change), and there are plenty of other badass gear sets to acquire. Plus, who knows - mods down the line, perhaps, this being on PC and all.  As for the game itself, if you've never played Dragon's Dogma, this is the time to do it. Sure, it might pale in comparison to something like the Witcher 3, but the game still stands strong thanks to its excellent combat system, which combines the ability to climb up on top of large foes and whack them to death (Shadow of Collossus style) with weighty, highly customizable action combat. The class system is awesome as well, allowing you to switch between classes on the fly once you've unlocked them, and even transfer some skills between classes.  The world is large (but not too large), incredibly fun to traverse (platforming ahoy!) and it is filled with quests to complete, monsters to slay, secrets to uncover, and treasure to plunder. It also has one of my favorite RPG aspects: content you can access early on, but can't complete until you're a total badass, later in the game. You haven't lived until you've returned at a higher level to hunt down that massive drake (who fried your lv. 3 ♥♥♥), climbed up its tail, and shanked it in the heart till it dropped, to finally collect your sweet, sweet rare loot.  Loot is incredibly satisfying too, with badass gear strewn all around the world, and super rare pieces that can appear in specific chests, or on certain enemies, which you can come back to again and again until you get the lucky roll on that piece you've been wanting. So while the RNG aspect is there, it's also controlled - which is a pretty brilliant idea, in my eyes.   Oh, and did I mention the brilliant, innovative pawn system? You can create your own pawn (an AI companion that fights by your side throughout the game), and hire up to two others, created by other players across the world. It's an awesome, unique system (if an acquired taste). Best part is, it ties directly into the story.  And as for story, Dragon's Dogma's is surprisingly deep, and philosophical - though it doesn't fully reveal its brilliance until you've finished the game. Hell, there's even a solid endgame waifu component.  Again, if you've been spoiled by the Witcher 3, you might look at this and turn up your nose. But understand that this is a port of a game that's several years old - and hot damn, is it a good port of a brilliant game at that.",

You need to be well prepared for everything in this game and even the slightest mistake can put you in deep trouble. You will find monsters of epic proportions and every win is a well deserved one.

Atmosphere and the sense of exploration are other things that will keep you coming back.

Weakest link could be its story. Dragons Dogma : Dark Arisen is a fantastic RPG game that can easily rival many others in the genre.

With controller I'm sure it would work better, but I only use controller for racing games. If i were a controller always type of gamer this would be a 10/10 game.  Anyone that loves RPGs, would be wise to grab this diamond in the rough.  Was a slight learning curve at the start. I'm an older gamer been at it for 31 years of my life not many modern games have a learning curve to me anymore, but I'm glad this one had a fresh feel to it. It's unique and the cless system kinda reminds me of final fantasy tactics. What I mean by that the job system lets you learn augments that you can carry over to the next vocation/job you choose. Jobs/vocation/classes support one another, which allows for some serious build combinations that is sure to keep you busy!   The weopon system is good aswell, certain weapons for certain jobs. Some may not like that, I know some people like to be able equip any armor and any weapon at anytime. Personally, I like the weapons/armor being specific to a class it keeps the player from being O.P.   Now, since we the PC master race gets all the dlc what this means we get extra modes of play, armor/weapons, items and quests. Hit the game's wikia up to learn all the gains from that. Game also has a new game+ system like any other you may have used in the past on other games. Max level is 200 (take you a bit to get there unless you a wimpy cheater). Enemies scale with level so they are always fun, but I've noticed as you upgrade weapons and armor at times have been easier than when i started. Also I guess maybe due to learning them and how they fight.  Lot more I should and could say. I'm a windy writer you'd be reading a massive wall of text, if I point out all the awesome things I could say about this game. (so read up on some other reviews because there is alot on main points the game has that I didn't write about)  So to be short, if you love action rpgs with class depth replay depth this game is indeed for you! Would even be for those new to rpgs or would like a breath of fresh air in the overly saturated rpg titles floating about. To this date this game should get game of the century award. I never expected capcom to make such a bad a*s rpg that I can see myself playing 500+++ hours.   I didn't mention how awesome bosses are they roam in the open world some are tough some are easy all depends on a few factors. I don't want to spoil the learning curve for you so I wont tell what it depends on hehe.  BUY THE GAME IT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY! (I don't say that about many games anymore so take it to heart)",

Have you ever played another fantasy game where you whacked a giant dragon’s ankles with your sword until he fell over? Did you wonder why you could only wail on his knees instead of jumping on his back and stabbing his eyes out? Well Dragon’s Dogma had the same thought and said, “You know what? ♥♥♥♥ it, why wouldn’t you just climb that ♥♥♥♥er?” And you CAN.  You can climb up a cyclops’ back and stab his eye out. You can ride a griffin into the air, cut its wings off mid-flight and crash-land that ♥♥♥♥er into the dirt. You can cut off a hydra’s head, watch it grow back, and then cut it off again with FIRE and stop it from happening again. YOU CAN PICK UP YOUR CLOSEST FRIENDS AND ALLIES AND THROW THEM INTO THE SEA FOR NO REASON OTHER THAN ♥♥♥♥♥ AND GIGGLES!  I hear you say, “How’s the story though? I look for story in my Action-RPGs!” Well hold on to your butts, because this game got hella story. It’s got the most metal ♥♥♥♥ing opening to any game I’ve seen in decades. It’s a tale of love, loss, revenge, and ♥♥♥♥ing COJONES. You get your heart ripped out by a dragon and ♥♥♥♥ing SURVIVE. All he’s got to say to you? “Come at me bro, if you want your ♥♥♥♥ing strawberry tart back.”  “But what about the art? I can’t enjoy a game unless it’s pretty!” Well first of all, that’s very close-minded, but YES THIS GAME IS PURTY AS ♥♥♥♥. This game’s art and setting is like that of the air-brushed panel van your weird uncle still owns in 2016. Your favorite metal album cover comes to life every time you turn this ♥♥♥♥ on!  “Okay, it’s got a cool setting and story. Can I make my own character? I’ve always wanted to make myse-” I’M GLAD YOU ASKED! The character creator in this game is supes deep! You want to play an 8-foot-tall amazon with a mohawk and ocular heterochromia? YOU CAN! You want to play a 12-year-old boy with no hair who’s also RIPPED AS ♥♥♥♥? YOU CAN! You want to play a withered old woman who single-handedly destroys her enemies with a zweihander? YOU CAN! THE SHEER RANGE OF BODY TYPES AND PHYSICAL FEATURES IS THE NUMBER 1 CAUSE OF LOSING HOURS IN THIS CHARACTER CREATOR.  “Okay, so you’re already headed towards clas-” SHUT THE ♥♥♥♥ UP IT’S CLASS TIME NOW! You want warriors? Done. Rogue? Done. Wizard? Done.  “But those are typica-” THE ♥♥♥♥ DID I JUST SAY? You can go those routes but hodamn you can cross class ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥! Wanna be a sword-and-board assassin? Done. A Magick Archer (magick with a K because IT’S ♥♥♥♥ING METAL)? Done. A Wizard-paladin with maces and tower-shields? Done! The classes are so unique and fun to play there’s not a one that’s dull if you ask me.  “But what about romance!”  I’m glad you asked, straw-man reader. Have you ever found an NPC in an RPG that stole your heart? Not like the dragon does, but like, uh… metaph- ♥♥♥♥ it, you know what I mean. Yes? Well this game let’s you make nice with and romance any named NPC. ANY NAMED NPC. The merchant? Banged. The captain of the foreign legion looking to prove herself? Woo’d. The ♥♥♥♥ing masked sailor moon villain? ♥♥♥♥ed. The little girl you meet? ♥♥♥♥in’ slow down there Jared Fogle… how did you even get internet access in prison? Anyways, it don’t matter your gender neither, ♥♥♥♥ who you want to ♥♥♥♥, friend.  I love this game. If any of what I've said appeals to you, and you’ve got the means, please buy it. This game was criminally overlooked when it came out and it deserves so much better than it got.   If enough people buy it, maybe we’ll get another one, eh? One that’s not Japan only.",

This is everything that a game shouldn't be; the final boss has an absurd amount of health, the flying enemies are incredibly annoying, and the story is stringier than last week's roast beef.  Basically, what I'm saying, is I call this game Daddy.  I do have a number of serious complaints about the game, as the story does fall flat, the flying enemies are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, and the final boss does have an absurd amount of health.  Beyond those, the characters are flat and all the quests have this sort of 'disconnected' feeling, as if they're there just to be there and have no impact at all, and many of the enemies feel repetitive.  And yet, for some reason, this has got to be one of the best games I've ever played. To put it simply: it's fun. While the world and lore could use some filling out, and most definitely the story could be told better, the gameplay is fantastic. It certainly isn't an immersive RPG such as The Elder Scrolls, but it combines the gameplay elements of a beat-em-up style fight system with the movement of Dark Souls and fluidity of The Witcher, and it does it excellently.  If you're a stickler for everything in an RPG, I think you'll dislike it, but if you're willing to put some time in and enjoy what it has to offer, this game truly is a great buy.",

This Rpg is pretty hardcore, and it takes a lot of time to pick up the pace and get depth, but it's pretty damn good. The fast-travel is very limited. you have to use (and buy) an item to teleport, and the location of the teleport is determined by placing Port crystals at a spot on the map. These port crystals a really damn rare, by the way. This makes it so that there's a lot of walking, but I don't mind. It's the right balance and I think it's a better dynamic than Skyrim.  You level up in 3 ways. I won't talk about them, but in all, I think it makes it so that it is rewarded to kill enemies that you wouldn't care to beat otherwise, so there is grinding, but it doesn't feel boring, or unnecessary.  The main quests have less quantity, but much more quality than Skyrim. They all have good cutscenes with choices that really matter. Some important combat sequences are also more linear, and it makes them more engaging, more cinematic. You don't want to miss the fight against the griffin inside an abandoned castle, it's actually epic and it moves from many locations. Some quests can be failed without you dying, and the only thing left to do is to report back with the news of the failure and live with the consequences. It's brutal.  You will also have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quests that ask you to pick 5 flowers, of kill 20 rabbits, it's not my thing, but it's there.  If you like Sandbox Rpg's like Skyrim, but you want more depth, something more hardcore, without any bugs, then this is for you. There is even a small Modding community.",

            "review_text": "Dragon's Dogma is such a wonderfully made game, in fact there needs to be more games like it in my opinion. The gameplay reminded me a little bit of when I played Witcher. It's set around the midevil time period and has many fantasy elements, which I'm such a fan of games having.  STRENGTHS:  A lot of classes you can choose from, and a great parkour system. A great interactive open world enviorment; I haven't felt so intuned in the enviorment of a game in quite a while and it was great experiencing that again. That being said, the bosses are also interactable which makes combat all the more interesting. I also loved the idea of the Pawns in the game, and knowing that someone can use my own Pawn if they wished too, or someone could probably could find my own pawn walking around in Gran Soren. I also loved seeing other peoples pawns and how they differed from each other when they would help me in my quests.  WEAKNESSES:  This game doesn't really cater to me very much. I'm a gamer just like everyone else on steam, but I notice this game doesn't really cater to female players. For example, the game doesn't really identify what gender you play as; it just assumes you're male by default. And I noticed this as certain scenes would play out in the game (like the quest for the Queen, unless she really is a bisexual harlot for everyone). I just didn't really like the Beloved system at all regardless of that though. You can't really tell who your beloved is going to be until the very end of the game and because of that Aelinor became my beloved and I had felt no attachment to her whatsoever (and also I happen to just be straight); so I was just really tempted to sacrifice her. Even though I had max affinity with ser Maximillian he still didn't end up being my beloved so the game let down on that. If the game added actual relationship points that the player could see that would have been better in my opinion. Also I feel like the menus could use some work. It was kind of awkward having an equipment menu separate from your inventory and sometimes it would just make things confusing.  I really don't have much else to complain about this game. I'm surprised it's not a more renowned game, especially with it being remastered. I hope more people find out about it and play it because it's definitely worth it. Also make sure to turn 'Pawn chatter' to off; you're welcome. ;)",

Now youre Arisen, quasi-immortal with the power to command the mysterious pawn legion and youd really want your heart back. But thats not really the whole story...  This isnt really a new game but now all you nonconsolehavers can buy it too and you should. Why?  First off, its a pretty darn good third person action RPG. Also it still looks pretty nice. The setting is interesting, its very low-fantasy european medieval style and everybody speaks a variant of some old english dialect where you dont say 'thou' all the time (thankfully. Everybody says 'aught' alot tho). Theres writing for almost all the characters including a great deal of the lowliest passerby npcs, only very few spout just a single line on repeat, many got different stuff to say as the story progresses. The story aswell is pretty good, what starts out as a simple dragon hunt goes down a multi-layered rabbit hole. However the game doesnt throw all the juicy bits readily, you have to dig abit and pay attention or straight up miss sidequests telling the more between-the-line stuff. I always feel reminded of Dark Souls when playing this.  Also some of the enemies you fight are pretty huge and impressive. Skyrim dragons aint ♥♥♥♥.  What sets this apart from just being a good hacky slashy casty rpg is the way your party works. Early on you get a permanent follower, a 'Pawn' you can totally customize and shape over the course of the game. A second player character almost (but hopefully dumber). The rest of the party will be other peoples pawns you recruit, and likewise other people can hire your pawn (doesnt mean it dissapears, its assumed it happens whenever you take a nap). While this would be pretty cool in itself your pawn doesnt level up while being out and about but can gain knowledge about quests and monsters and it also earns you a special currency. This can have an interesting dynamic- do you focus on blinging out your pawn instead of yourself so you get more hires?   The downside i guess is you dont get any fleshed out party characters with deep backstories like in Dragons Age or whatnot but while the Pawn AI isnt Skynet theres enough variables and flags to them that each pawn can be quite unique - they can even learn your bad habits to some extent.  Last but not least altho in a better world this shouldnt be worth mentioning, this is an excellent port. Nothing too fancy, increased resolution and such but thouroughly solid.",

We should be able to command pawns properly and individualy for each battle, not just set inclination so they act exactly the same in each battle and situation. Also, they should never be able to change their inclinations, unless players chooses to. - Pawns are dumb, they could at least avoid freaking red AOE circle that counts down towards them being insta killed. - Very few interesting NPCs. - most of the top gear (dlc gear) looks terrible - auto rating of rented pawns if they die - 'romance' is poorly made, if you want to put it in game, make it right - if you skip certain side quests, you won't unlock some other side quests and there is no warning for that. - game saving system is bad, it doesn't fit this game. It's similar as in Dark souls, but it works in DS, because DS doesn't have much of a choices to be made, at least nothing really important. DD however has bunch of quests, which, if you mess up, can lock away quests, area, merchants, npcs etc. - ♥♥♥♥ tons of clipping issues.  Overall, game is lots of fun, especially core game on first playthrough. DLC is fun first time around, after that it depends what you like. If you like grinding for top gear, it's good, but if you like exploring, there is not much to do there. If there is DD2 in the future I'd like to see pawn system get major overhaul and coop implemented with a lot harder 'hard mode'. Bigger world map and few more types of enemies with more lively NPCs wouldn't hurt as well.  Worth the price.",

The positives:  - The combat is very satisfying and the quests keep you busy throughout your adventure.  - Characters customizations are plenty, and the game throws allot of cool items/weapons your way - The story is interesting because it places you in very unique boss encounters. - Open world is filled with secrets and powerful items. - Pawn system, create your own pawn and hire others to help you in your adventures. - While quests might look simple from the outside, they often can be linked and thus your decisions and actions will shape the events in different ways. - Great value on PC, you get a ton of content for your money. - Makes Fable look like child's play, and puts some popular ARPGs to shame in the battle mechanics department. - A fair difficulty curve, and then later you can torture/challenge yourself in the Dark Arisen campaign in Hard Mode if you wish to.  The negatives:  - Main storyline is pretty short. - Some romance features are not fleshed out properly which can lead to some funny/weird moments. - There are allot of kill X amount of Y quests in the game (some might not like this, I am just putting it out there) - CAPCOM could have easily further spruced up the visuals with higher resolution textures and ambient occlusion. - Abysmal anti-aliasing implementation, but can be easily fixed by using SweetFX 2.0 - ReShade and inject SMAA + plus some texture sharpering filters as well.  BOTTOM LINE  While not the most 'sophisticated' open world ARPG ever made, it offers a unique take on the formula and delivers epic boss battles.",

In Dragons Dogma you make your character your ally whom you can share with other players and go on a quest to fight a dragon who ate your heart. This is no small ♥♥♥ Skyrim dragon this dragon is about the size of a stadium and at the start watching your character harmlessly hitting the dragon in its toe is humbling and this makes the game feel like you the player are fighting something that regards you as less than a fly. The combat is quick and fast to pick up and the player can choose from many play styles like warrior, archer, magician and so on. Now much like the dragon being awe inspiring the magic in this game is 2nd to none and makes the player feel like magic is powerful and not tiny fireballs you impishly throw at the enemy. Whether its calling down a tornado, summoning meteors from the heavens or 3 large ice tendrils to pierce your enemy the magic is large, powerful looking and further pushes this game foward as a game about feeling like you do have power and can do big damage the more you play and level up. Pick this game up if you like open world exploration RPGs and want to finally feel like you do have phenominal cosmic powers when playing as a wizard and not a nancy who throws tiny rays of light to do damage.",

            "review_text": "'Skyrim with fantastic combat.'  Not Skyrim with guns. No. This is another medieval romp through a large open world where fetch quests don't make the slightest attempt to hide themselves. This is the game that released in 2012 and manages to look and feel like a much older game in terms of everything but combat. But in a world that can manage to bring us something like The Witcher 3, which excels in everything but combat, it's nice to have a change of pace and dive back into something that feels a lot more like a From Software title or something of the like.  Dragon's Dogma doesn't joke around with its combat. It's fast paced, and allows for the player to play almost however they want to, whenever they want to, without the need to go back and make a new character of a different class. Play as a tanky melee based warrior who takes a brunt of the damage with his/her shield, or maybe a dagger-based rogue who climbs on the heads of enemies and pokes them in the eye? Why not a sorcerer who summons tornadoes from the sky? Or perhaps a blend of one of the three? A caster warrior? A caster rogue? Not only does this game let you switch classes really easily, but it highly encourages it, locking passive abilities like rolling, double jumping, carrying more weight, etc... behind these classes.  As mentioned, the quests, while fairly dated in terms of presentation, are passable enough, and don't hinder the rest of the game's content too much.  Also, the pawn system is amazing, and what's even more incredible is that no other game has attempted to take a stab at this game mechanic. You've got your main character, and a sidekick who you can tweak the gear, class, skills, appearance, name, etc... of, that will also be accessible to other players and friends online. The other two members of your party can be NPC pawns, or the pawns of other online players and friends. While the AI for them may appear dumb at first, it's much deeper than it seems. The pawns all have unique characteristics that you can modify (only on your pawn), which determine how they behave in and out of combat. Some will have knowledge of the quest you're currently on. Some will know that this particular enemy you're fighting is vulnerable to lightning and not fire. In a way, this makes up for the dated quest system, because while you may be capable of accepting a quest, only through the knowledge that your pawn and other pawns obtain will you be able to track down objectives. It feels really unique, especially if you don't end up looking up the quest objective's location online. It's this weird type of progression that as mentioned before, hasn't really been done before or after this game.  You'll also hear the inexperienced complain about stuff like the pawn chatter, but this type of feature ties in well with them being capable of being more or less knowledgeable about a certain subject. Things like, 'this enemy is weak to fire', or, 'cut off its tail to make it more vulnerable to our attacks', will frequently be said, which may aid you in your fights against the various enemies throughout the game who all have their own unique weaknesses. Maybe you didn't know that climbing onto the back of this particular enemy caused it to knock its own helmet off, rendering its head more vulnerable to your attacks. Maybe you didn't know that burning this enemy's wings prevented it from flying away and fleeing the fight. Maybe you didn't know that wolves hunt in packs. Your pawns will frequently remind you of these various things, and it really makes them feel more alive and a part of your group.  And I'm not even into the content of Dark Arisen yet...",

It brings back the traditional days of RPGs(IE, Neverwinter,ect.) in which conditions effect how combat plays.  The story without spoiling alot, has alot more meaning then just 'Kill this evil dragon', it is more then that and it can either leave you fullfilled with a game complete, or literally 'drenched'(one of the conditions ingame) with tears.  The combat, is fluid and the difficulty (atleast at the start of the game) can be quite hard, and most likely hard mode(going to start it after NG+) is comparable to Dark Souls or it's precursor Demon Souls. And lastly, the Pawn System(think of followers from TES). It allows people to connect without actually 'connecting', and people get to better train their own pawn. There are countless words, good and bad which can be said about the Pawn System, but in the end it is one very few games out there have tried to replicate or improve.  So would I recommend this game to people, yes! If your looking for a game which is just fight fight and fight without meaning, then I suggest looking elsewhere.",

            "review_text": "A formidable entry into the Open World RPG landscape that stands on it's own.  The biggest questions I hear when asking about this game are how it compares to others of it's ilk, so I will frame this review as a sort of Q&amp;A for those already familiar with open world RPGs and wanting to see how it compares:   -How long is the game?: An average playthrough just focusing on the story could be about 40 hours on average, speedruns can be done under 10 hours, and completionist playthroughs could last well past the 100 hour mark.  -How big is the game world?: It's by no means the biggest around, games like The Witcher 3 and Skyrim are certainly larger, but the landscape does feel varied and interesting, and the lack of significant fast travel options means you will be doing a lot of foot-travel which makes the world seem more vast.  -How good is the story?: It stands well enough on it's own, rarely gripping, but usually not boring either. The presentation certainly could use some work but it is passable.  -How is the game difficulty?: It is NOT Dark Souls, and you shouldn't go in expecting anything like that, but it is very much an ACTION RPG and player skill as well as character skill matters immensely in this game, you will live or die by how well you can play and how effeciently you set up your character and team.  -Is it non-linear?: Yes and no, the main story follows a fairly linear path, seldom with any deviations, but you progress at your own pace. The gameworld however with very few exceptions is open right from the beginning and you could easily wander into places you probably shouldn't well before you are ready.  -How complex is the game's learning curve: It's very standard JRPG level complexity in most cases, you level up, you gain skill points, you learn new skills, get new gear, and so on. Anyone familiar with RPGs will never feel overwhelmed by the systems themselves, though you can dive pretty deep into some, particularly where Pawn AI is concerned.  -I see this game is party-based, can I play it Solo?: Kind-of, you can run with just you and your Main Pawn and never use Hired Pawns through the game, and if your main pawn falls in battle (or... gets tossed off a cliff) then they will not return until after you've touched a rift-stone, so you can effectively play with a solo character. This is extremely difficult though and not for the faint of heart.  -How useful are the companions in this game? Will they get in the way?: Party AI is where this game truly shines, it has better companions than any other open world RPG I've ever played, even turn-based. Your Pawns will learn new strategies and can adopt specific inclinations that govern their behavior. A well geared pawn with appropriate skills for their vocation and the right inclinations never feels like a burden, they are always a complement to your party and it works very well. The only annoying part (depending on individual preference) is how much your pawns talk, but even this can be altered to some degree.  -Does the game have much customization?: For you and your main pawn there's quite a bit of visual customization you can do, controlling their body and facial features, deciding how big or small they are (which actually affects your stats), there's even a barber shop in-game for further tweaking the appearances. In terms of items there is weapon enhancing which improves an items stats by combining gold and several rare ingredients, and item combination which lets you combine 2 items into one new one. Both are quite basic systems but work very well and are easy to grasp and fairly robust.  -How is the combat?: One word: Amazing! It's not the most challenging, but it's got an incredible amount of charm. Your average run of the mill bandits and goblins tend to swarm you in groups and use group AI to beat your party. Larger enemies like Drakes, Cyclops, Golems, Chimaeras, and the like each have their own unique AI, skillsets, and weaknesses, and no battle ever feels like a straight up hack-n-slash spam. You will often have to target various weakpoints on an enemy to bring them down, or even jump and climb on them like in Shadow of the Colossus and try to hold on for dear life while you strike at them. There are tons of different enemy types in the game and each one feels unique. Your party AI works great in battle and your pawns learn from fighting different enemies and will become more adept at fighting certain enemies the more they bring down.  -How are the visuals?: The game was originally released on 7th Generation Consoles (PS3/360) and was far from the best visuals of that generation. They are certainly good enough, the landscape looks quite clean and interesting, and the monsters all have unique and interesting looks but everything feels like they went for more quantity over quality, like in a MMO. The locations are often nice to look at but after playing The Witcher or Elder Scrolls I found little that made me go 'WOW'  Is there replay value?: Yes. The game boasts several modes specifically aimed at extended play and replay. After beating the main game, the world changes to a 'post-game' state which includes harder monsters around and lets you keep playing. It also unlocks New Game + which allows you to continue a new game with all your levels, items, and skills intact. Hard mode exists separately from the other difficulties and drastically weakens your character while increasing enemy attack power and gold drops. There is also a speedrun mode available. The three basic vocations as well as some of the more advanced ones all have very unique and different playstyles which strongly encourages further replay with a different style character.  Is the game like 'X' or 'Y'?: No. There is really no other RPG I can adequately compare DD:DA to, it stands completely on it's own and while you can compare specific features between games, few come together like this game does.   FINAL WORDS: If you like open world RPGs, if you like action driven combat, if you like complex party AI, if you like easy to learn but rewarding and interesting RPG mechanics, if you like fighting huge fantastical beasts, and if you like a long engaging world to explore for easily over 30 hours, then definitely check this game out. It may not be the best open world RPG you ever played but bottom line:  Is it fun?: YES  Is it worth $30?: YES",

The game looks good, much better than it did on the PS3.  The game play is good but a little off sometimes (I love large monsters but hate how climbing works.) the combat is good, its fluid, its fun. The classes are decently diverse, and promote a lot of different play styles.  The pawns... Well wolves hunt in packs arisen.  Depending on how you play the game it can be short or long, you can take your time and enjoy the world, or you can do a literal speed run.  My only real complaint/want is the fact that there wasnt enough content. Dark Arisen was a wonderful expansion, but I want more of that, I want to be able to explore the world more. I would love to see more of Mercedes' kingdom, or be able to explore the 'old' world you get to see when you fight Grigori. Id also love for more armor's/weapons I dont care about min max, i just love being able to make a fun outfit with a weapon that matchs. And hat is all I want, more, more of the world.  Would I recommend this game? Yes, I would I would whole heartedly recommend this game, its $30 for a game that you can sink dozens if not hundreds of hours in... As long as you turn off pawn chat.",

As for the game itself; DD:DA boasts a large, open-world action RPG with lots of customization in almost every way. The combat is fun and fluid, clearly taking hints from games like Monster Hunter and DMC. The visuals are stunning, the story is immersive, and I never found myself getting bored (clocked over 100 hours on the PS3 version before moving on).  The game does fall flat on voice acting, lip sync, some animations, and the roleplay aspect, and the interface can be a bit of a pain to get used to at first.  Whether or not this RPG is new to you or you are looking to play it through again, I can't recommend DD:DA enough.   8/10",

It has weight and walking around with your party of 4 feels like a DnD game come to life.   The class system is fantastic. You're level is independant of your class level and the stats you gain per level are determined by which class you're playing. This means that you can get the cool class skills without waiting until the end game and you become more specced to play a certain class the more you play it. You can focus on min-maxing or try out everything and you won't be punished for it. Each class has their own strengths and they all play very differently. A warrior swings around a big ♥♥♥ weapon in slow but strong hits, a Mage hopes to stay safe long enough to cast a massive spell, a strider moves quickly through battle, taking potshots with his bow and the Hybrid classes get unique skills like the Magic cannon, immolation or dire gouge.   Finally, 90% of the story may be nonsensical and generic but that last 10% is quite good. Also, the DLC (which comes with the PC version) is very good. It's sort of like adding about 20% more Dark Souls and removing anything that doesn't involve fighting big ♥♥♥ and or strong monsters. I hope they make a sequel.",

From the start you're thrust into a battle against a chimera, showing off much of the core battle mechanics from the get-go. I can tell you the moment I realised I could GRAB on to and SCALE large enemies 'Shadow of the Colossus' style, I knew I had found a gem.  Combat is as fast as you desire, with many abilites focused on speed and maneuverability or slow and powerful. Progression is steady but noticeable, you really feel that power-up when you get a better weapon or upgrade it at the blacksmith, or in the flames of a wyrm. Boss battles are memorable and epic, with a great sense of achievement from completion.  Pros: -Flexible, free and responsive combat, play how you want to play. -Large world with oodles of content to complete. -Multiple storylines to follow and complete at your pace. -Epic boss fights against well-known mythological creatures such as chimera, harpies, cyclopes and dragons (or wyrms). -Endgame stuff that's actually worth doing. -You get the girl (or guy! can be anyone!)  Cons: -Slow to get into unless you're super invested in ARPG's (this does speed up dramatically when you get ferrystones) -Storyline doesn't really get affected too much by your decisions, it's pretty binary (but the story is still really enjoyable) -Some quests are really difficult to complete as there is a distinct lack of information. (only a handful) -You may accidently fail or entirely miss core side-story quests from the way quests are obtained.   tldr; this game is really for people who love ARPG's (like me!) and want to spend silly amounts of time absorbed in a large game, once you get into it I guarentee you'll be surprised how many 'accidental hours' slip by, it's really that immersive.",

ANGRY PAT somtimes stopped on occation to collect mushrooms and grumble about this 'woolie' fellow.

ANGRY PAT and I quickend our pace to meet the commander there. But something perculiar had caught my eye. I noticed a trail leading off towards a little grotto.

My loyal but very upset pawn soldiered onwards the path untill he dissappeared around a rockface.I followed.  As i made my way around the rockface, I found ANGRY PAT strangling a harpy. His dimunative stature bolted the winged creature into the dirt as be called out to me 'NOW ARISEN'.I lifted up my staff to deliver a fiery greeting to ANGRY PAT's new friends but decided not to. You see, as a great sorceress I have learned that magic is never the solution to meager problems. There is always a better or smarter way to get pass the daily hardships of dealing with monsters.

I quickly dashed off to the side and made my way up a large rock. Luckily for me, ANGRY PAT was right back up charging towards the giant. With the time I had, I took a minute to survey the area. A waterfall, a few trees, a narrow path, and a very very long drop the side of the cliff into the sea. OH MY GOODNESS. I had a plan.  I lept off the rock and positioned myself near the the very edge of a cliff. My staff surged with energy from the ether as I formed a fire ball in my hand. ANGRY PAT was on the beast head, chipping away at it's eyeball with his sword. The beast swayed about, trying to grab at ANGRY PAT, not realizing that it drew closer and closer to where I stood. It wasn't long before my red-headed pawn was caught between the giant fingers of the beast. ANGRY PAT could do nothing but throw obsenities and kept cursing this 'Woolie' fellow. The beast longingly glared at the bald dwarf in his clutches and licked his lips. As a great sorceress, I knew what was going to happen next and it was not a kiss. I took the oppotunity to fling the fireball right into the creature's wide eyes.  The beast roared in pain as the heat infiltrated his skull. He dropped ANGRY PAT who quickly rolled to my side. We turned and jumped out of the way as the beast swung around in a frenzy, looking blindly the Great Sorceress that blinded him. The cliff endge drew closer and closer to the beast. ANGRY PAT and I watched as the one eyed monster tumbled down into the depths of the unforging sea.   I turned to ANGRY PAT and told him 'Good work, guy'. For a brief moment, I noticed the scrowl that plagued ANGRY PAT's hairy face turn slowly into a little smirk. That it was only a brieft moment, for you see a harpy snatched my dwarven companion into the sky. The winged creature flew higher and higher towards the sea untill it gave into the weight of the thrashing dwarf beneath it. Gravity took over. ANGRY PAT feel to his doom. I walked back up to the path and made my way to the Rift stone near the gates at the mountain pass.",

            "review_text": "If your are looking for an open world RPG with satisfying action combat, then look no further! Dragon's Dogma is an open world action RPG game packed with content that will keep you sucked in the world of Gransys for hundreds of hours. I have originally played the initial 2011-2012 releases of the vanilla game and the Dark Arisen expansion. I played through the game multiple times, on all vocations and have acquired almost all possible loot in-game (minus the loot in Bitterblack Isle cause too much RNG). To this day I can say that this game is one of my favorite games of all time. It's a hidden gem that's rough around the edges, however if one is an RPG enthusiast who's looking for a memorable journey, then giving this game a ride is an obligation.  Pros: +Satisfying and smooth action combat. +Diverse gameplay with up to 9 different vocations offering unique playstyles. +Vocation customization, allowing players to change their skill sets and setup passive skills (augments) to complement their playstyle. +Amazing soundtrack that makes encounters intense. +No hand holding. If you miss something, you miss it permanently until your next playthrough. +The aspect of preparing before a rigorous journey. +Pawn and Party system. Great system if you know what you're doing. +Day and night isn't just an aesthetic change. It's a gameplay change. +Climbing monsters! +Diverse bestiary. +Multiple ways to deal with enemies! +Most items are useful and have a purpose in the game. +Debilitants are punishing. +Boss encounters are epic. This game has one of the best boss fights in any RPG to date. +Possibility to turn off Pawn banter if it's too irritating (I personally enjoy listening to them). +Parkour. +Black cat *hint hint*. ;) +Best looking spells in any RPG to date. If you love playing as a mage in RPGs, then this game is for you.   Cons: -Story execution is weak. Only interesting in the beginning and later parts of the game. -Climbing mechanic can be wonky at times. -Jail and romance mechanics are half baked. -Pawns can be a nuisance if you don't know what you're doing. -Melee classes are gimped against airborne foes. -Warrior can only equip 3 skills. I don't understand this design choice. Shame cause this class has the potential to faceroll. -Too much loot RNG in Bitterblack Isle. -Some monsters are CHEAP!   In conclusion, this game in my opinion is a unique experience, and if you're like me: looking for an open world RPG with amazing combat and epic monster encounters, then this game is for you. I give this game a solid 8/10 and wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who's looking for an epic adventure.",

Do you like the vague, yet deep storytelling of games like Dark Souls? You might like this game. Do you like for every single thing to be explained, even the fast travel system? You might like this game. Have you played Shadow of the Colossus? I won't bother asking if you liked it, because you did, and you might like this game. Is it just your favorite to be stuck with your character's appearance forever? You might like that in this game you can eventually buy an item that lets you redo it entirely as many times as you want. Would you like your character's size to have an actual tangible effect on gameplay and exploration? You might like this game. Does the idea of climbing on the back of a griffin with a flaming pair of daggers and slashing at its wings until it falls out of the sky sound like an appealing experience to you? You might like this game. Do you like the idea of spells that are actually cool-looking? You might like this game? Are you just coming off of a big Skyrim load order, wanting some fresh fundamental gameplay? You might like this game.  Negatives: Do you dislike backtracking? You might not like parts of this game. ( You can skip the backtracking on subsequent playthroughs though.) Do you barf at the sight of less-than-fantastic meshes and textures? You might not like this game.   Port Quality: This port is phenomenal, especially relative to its Japanese port brethren. It supports everything up to 4K/150fps, and it runs at 1080p/60fps maximum settings flawlessly on my mid-to-high range laptop. If you want a game that you can sink thousands of hours into, this would be the place to look. A few aspects of the gameplay have been improved as well. You can now hotkey up to five items, and you can disable your pawns' incessant chatter if you so desire. You can no longer cosplay as Guts, but that armor set was outclassed pretty quickly anyway.  Final Verdict: Personally, my favorite game of all time. It has its problems, but what can I say? I like the idea of Shadow of the Colossus as an rpg, and it works pretty dang well here. 10/10",

            "review_text": "This is easily one of my all-time favorite games. I originally owned it on PS3, and returned to it numerous times over the years to run additional play-throughs. And never once did I lose my sense of wonder as I explored the game world.   PROS :  - Combat : I'm sure you have heard it a hundred times already. The combat is definitely one of the defining factors of the greatness of this game. Every swing of your sword, every flashy spell, has weighty impact to it. Scaling monsters to attack weak points and lobbing minions off of cliffs is clever, and more importantly, fun. Every approach to combat is a delight.  - Pawns : regardless of constant reminders regarding wolves and packs, the pawn system is what truly makes the game unique. I love character creation, and utlilizing DD's in-depth creation system, I was able to cater a companion perfectly to my hero. I also get to experience that same level of care in two additional companions that have been created by other players in the world. It is so exciting, setting out on an adventure with a party that has been (usually) carefully crafted to support my hero.  - Monsters : although many fit into stardard RPG beast types, the monsters are thrilling to encounter and, subsequently, defeat. The large monsters in particular truly give you the impression, even only visually, that they will kill you and your party if you do not have your guard up. They are fun to fight, fun to conquer, and when they kill you, it simply adds to the danger (and thus, excitement) of fighting them again.  - Music : the soundtrack contains music to set the mood for every event in the game. Be it a grand battle, a touching moment between characters, or simply wandering around the city, every song belongs.   - Story : those of you who have played the game to completion know what I am talking about when I say that the story's end is actually very good. Up till the last few stages, the story is a tad bland. Regardless, it is exciting to see your personally-crafted hero have the story revolving around him/her.  - World : although perhaps a tad small in comparison to other AAA RPGs, the world of DD is enjoyable to explore. There are many landmarks and defining features to explore by even without referencing the map. And with all of the giant monsters to encounter wandering the open world, you will find yourself aimlessly setting off in a direction, just to see what there is to see.   CONS :  - Voice-acting/Dialogue : part of what makes the story weak is the shoddy voice-acting and dialogue. Some of the conversations add quite a lot of humor and charm to the experience, but during some of the more 'epic' moments, certain characters could have delivered their monologue with more 'umph' and emotion.  - Graphics : Don't get me wrong: this is, by all definitions, a fantastic port. The game runs incredibly smoothly, and plays so much better for the higher performance. And admittedly, the poor textures are only noticeable when you are standing still (which, in such an action-heavy game, is not often). I personally think it is a beautiful game, especially considering it is five years old. I simply wish some of the more noticeable, awkward flaws could have been steamed out.  I would highly recommend this game to any newcomer who is a fan of action-combat RPGs (Dark Souls, The Witcher, The Elder Scrolls). For veterans, it is very much worth the small monetary investment to play a beloved game in the high-definition glory it deserved years ago.",

Fighting the bosses I have so far will be memorable thanks to being able to climb up them and attack various weak spots. (and also falling to my death from climbing onto a gryphon ;) )  The class system is fairly in depth and you can swap between any of the classes in game for a small cost (discipline points) when you get to the main city.  Exploration is probably the main thing I love about this game. Lots of areas to explore with loot to boot and accidently stumbling upon a boss-like creature is fun.  My only gripe is the story is a little lacking and I feel that NPCs could be fleshed out a bit more but I haven't been bothered by it too much. I haven't finished the game yet (only on the 4th Wyvern Hunt quest now) but here's hoping it picks up a bit after this.  I would definitely recommend this game, 8/10",

Having never heard of the Dragons Dogma franchise before i wasnt sure what to expect and was pleasantly surprised by this fantasy RPG. Its taken a few years for this port to arrive on PC for some reason, but its an entirely good thing that this has happened. Yes the graphics arent top notch but still perfectly adequate and serve their purpose well.  The game is similar to the likes of Dragon Age, The Witcher etc so if you love those games youll fina alot to like here. I bought the pc version as it adds on the Dark Arisen expansion pack which i didnt experience at the time so ill be putting quite a few hours in. The game sees your hero as a person whos had their heart stolen by a dragon and a strange curse put on you so your still alive. You are taksed with killing the dragon and stealing back your heart. The game follows the usual main storyline questing with plenty of additional side quests to keep you busy. The games unique point is its Pawn system, where you 'borrow' another players levelled npc helper to help you out on quests, and your NPC can be summoned into other peoples games to assist. The unique thing is if the pawns have experience of a certain quest or monster knowledge aquired from their own adventures they will share this with you and other players they meet along the way. Its a nice touch and brings an almost multiplayer feel to this single player adventure. Like all good RPGs, theres plenty of depth to be found in the character levelling and crafting systems and theres nothing overlly complicated regards the crafting.  Id recommend this game if like i said previously your a fan of fantasy RPG's its a good solid entry into the genre and is more than worthy of a look.",

I had been hearing mixed opinions about this game when it first launched, but I can't really see why now. The game is really good and after playing through it, it only got me hopping for a sequel of some sorts.  There are three issues that I have with it though that I'll go through quickly:   -First of all, the climbing on monsters doesn't really feel that good. You kind of glue yourself on them and can get lost between their legs. At least it's there and I don't HAVE to climb on them so that's more of a nitpick.  -Second, and also related to combat, the weapon combinations are kind of lacking. Each class can use specific weapons but you can only have a specific primary and a specific secondary. Would have been better if each class could use specific weapons but use them as they see fit.  -Finally, some of the quests should have had more impact on how NPCs treat you, especially those directly involved. Kind of feels weird when you have obviously annoyed an NPC or the general population by doing something and then the next time you speak to them they act like nothing happened.  Honestly, these are rather minor issues compared to how much fun the game is, but they were the only issues that I had with the game.  The thing that really sets this game apart from the rest is the variety and craziness that goes with the ending. It's a sudden bombardment of lore that changes everything you knew in a matter of a few minutes. However, it still made sense. Pieces of the puzzle that I didn't even consider important suddenly came into place to make sense of it all. Little details in the story, or even in the game mechanics were parts of the whole point of it all.  I kind of expected some sort of generic 'kill the Dragon and call it a day while walking into the sunset' fantasy RPG, but this turned out to be much more than that. Now, to go through the 'Dark Arisen' portion of the game which I totally ignored....",

This PC port turns all these flaws into distant memories and I now feel like I'm playing the game as it always was intended to be... And it f****** rocks !  Of course, it isn't perfect and some would even say it's broken in multiple aspects (weird difficulty peaks, annoying quest markers, stupid AI that won't ever shut up, etc...) but for each issue, it offers 10 times the pleasure.  For starters, the fighting system is one of the best ever implemented into an ARPG, letting you climb on huge ennemies an wage epic battles with no QTE ever (except if you count wiggling the sticks once in a while to escape an enemy's hold). That combat system is also backed up by an extremely well executed class system that allows you to change class while still keeping some perks you obtained for another, which gives a great freedom to customize your gameplay style. And you can customize your pawn with almost as much freedom as your character (only hybrid classes aren't allowed, can't figure out why). On top of that, the character creation menu used to design your character and pawn allows almost anything you can image from tank-like bearded giants to to little pig-tailed girls. For instance, one of the last pawns I recruited was a warlock Gaben that looked just like the real one.  The graphics might be a bit updated (let's wait a little for modders to fix that) but the game still looks great thanks to a wonderful art style and character/creature design. And I can't wait to play some of the end-game sequences that were already breathtaking on the console version.  Finally, if you're the kind of player that appreciates replayability, DDDA proposes one of the best NG+ systems I've ever encountered with a clever plot justification that will definitely make you want to do a second (or third) run.  Conclusion : 10/10, probably GOTY as far as I'm concerned.",

I bought the original for console, and bought it again on PC without a second thought. Truly, it is a game that looks far better in motion than in still screenshots. I feel that it was sadly overlooked when it originally came out despite there being nothing quite like it out there. A lot of games are hailed for pushing boundaries in design, but I feel this is one of the few that truly tried in recent memory, even with some mixed results here and there.   Many of the enemies and creatures encountered in the game, don't feel like knockoffs, it feels like you are fighting the honest to god, beasts of myth and legend brought to life, the genuine original deal, and not some new-age interpretation made by a starving concept artists desperate to justify their employment.  This is a game, and universe that needs more love from CAPCOM and gamers in general, and has quite possibly the best dragon battles in gaming, possibly the most fluid combat in an open world Action RPG, along with one of the best dragon characters to appear in a game as more than just a fodder monster.  It is an unpolished gem, that desperately needs a true sequel by the original team and director, to refine its concepts and achieve true greatness.",

Does Capcom hate free press? Do they even care about ther game? The Answer is they want more money, seems coporate commando has a tight grip on this game's balls... so much sad.   Despite this it's a great game, has ALOT of pop- in issues, but plays like a dream. The classes are fun to play, enemies are difficult but not without their weaknesses and the world feels alive... if you can get over the constant jabbering of your companions. Lighting is pretty decent, though I'm confused as to why you cannot swim? Apparently you melt if you go too far out, threw some hapless villager out into the shallows and poof he was gone.

It's really nothing like the souls games, in fact it's not like many RPG's I've played.  The first basis of comparison that springs to mind is Dragons of Amalur (Which is unfair because that tanked)   Honestly this is one of the best RPG's I've played in a long time, the story is frankly excellent, it takes a while to get going but it really did draw me in, the lore of the game is massive.   The world is huge, it takes a long time to travel, and while it does feel empty at times, exploring it all for the first time was extremely interesting.  The game is relatively challenging as well, you have no idea what level enemies are in relation to yours, you often have no idea what they are weak to either.  Then you have the Pawns, your soul-less amusing servants whom love to just inform you of absolutely everything.  Did you know wolves hunt in packs? If not, you will.   All in all I give the game an 8/10, I was extremely surprised, it's a game that keeps on giving as well. I hope they make a sequal, this game with modern graphics and tech would be incredible.",

Pawns are really grating on the ears, so ask your pawn the STFU as soon as you can. Though the game is pretty the character models are meh and so are some of the textures up close. With all that nitpicky stuff out of the way, please get this game. I have a big thing for class systems and this is one of the best in an open world RPG. With each rank up you unlock new abilities that often make you crazy stunts, if you chose that path. The enemies (though they are very few types and they spawn in the same spot) have weakness to exploit to make the battle go faster. Combat is fun, especially with bosses. The aforementioned abilities make combat flashy, and fast paced. However the star of the show is the boss battle that let you climb on large beasts and stab them shadow of the colossus style. Easily the best part of this game. This game has a lot more to it, but the way I see it is that if my words have peaked your interest then you should get this game or at least wait for it to go on sale. If you like the shadow of the clossus, this is a match made in heaven. It’s not a perfect game nor is it the best looking, but it’s one of my favorites and I HIGHLY recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen is a masterpiece RPG.  There's so many good things, so many things done right, I don't even know where to begin. I don't think it's possible to have a place to begin with the vastness of this game. In short, if you love Witcher 3, and/or Dark Souls, then get this. It's like they came together and made a beautiful RPG child.  I'll try keeping it simple, as it would be impossible to cover anything, I'll cover throwing in some big pros and cons.  Pros;  +Interesting open world; this world truely captured that medieval magic feel like Oblivion did. First area is a tad bland, but it's fine as it's the tame..ish area.  +Extremely well done enemies; while the AI itself is a tad dumb with their short agro/chase range, the actual combat and abilities are perfectly done, and the enemies live in their respectable areas like they should, there's a huge range and veriety in the enemies unlike a certaint RPG spamming Draugr everywhere they possible can instead of making new enemies.   +Incredible friendly AI; A true rare thing to have good friendly AI. They listen to commands pretty well, fight pretty well, and actually /learn/. Can you believe it? AI with a learning mechanic? Incredible. They'll learn terrain, enemy weaknesses and strengths as they fight along side you. You can also set what their abilities are.  +Infamy like Oblivion; dear god, I thought this was extinct after Bethesda went the casual route with Skyrim. You can actually get a reputation with the NPCs based on your chocies and actions which can effect your gameplay. Something many developers like Bethesda are scared to do now because it ads weight to your choice which usually scares off casual players.  +Extremely fun, wet dream induced combat and magic; Oh my, the combat/magic. How could you possibly do better than this? They're all extremely fun, sword combat feels a lot like Dark Soul's, Archery is strong, fast, and you can do crazy abilities like vollying, power shots, and more. But most importantly; magic, the thing every game always has gotten wrong since the beginning is incredible in this game, they are visually astounding and awesome to look at, as well as powerful and reliable. You can put elemental buffs on weapons, create a silencing/blinding aura around you, call lightning strikes from heaven, and even summon a kingdom sized tornado to devestate everything. Sorcerer fans, you will not be disapointed with this game's strong spells.  +Good combat music; Don't know how I can put how music is good into text, but it's good and fits the style and combat.  +Did I mention the magic is ♥♥♥♥ing incredible?  +Great lighting; Dark is actually dark in this game unlike most. You can't see more than 5 feet if it's night time or a dark dungeon, which requires you to end up using a lamp. I personally love when developers realize humans don't see perfectly in the dark, they realize in a medival world with 0 light pollution you won't see dik at night.   One thing that could be a plus, or a downside, is Hardcore mode. I can't say it's a pro or a con, but I do personally feel that Hardcore mode on this is absaloutely stupid. No matter what you do, everything one shots you. This can be great for anyone who wants a challange, it's not impossible by any means. But I find their method for difficulty absaloutely lazy. But I can guarantee this game can offer the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ stretching difficulty you thirst for that Dark Souls delivered just fine.  Another thing is no choice in main quest; this is USUALLY pretty bad for RPGs, but for Dragon's I don't exactly feel this is a big blow as the campaign is already really damn interesting. A campaign doesn't always need choice if they have a story to tell, like in Legend of Zelda or Oblivion.  Las tthing I can't give opinion on is that you can't use whatever you want and be whatever you want. At the beginning you choose your path of swordsman, archer, sorcerer, etc. and stick to that tree line. This doesn't bother me in the slightest, but if that alone turns you away, then that's a shame.  Cons;  -Butt ugly character faces and skin; you will not make anyone look all too attractive. Everyone has sickly skin with giant ♥♥♥ pors.  -Awkward controls for Mouse+Keyboard; Yes, the controls are very much confusing at first, though you CAN get use to them and use them effectively, they're not impossible, but the devs could of easily had a different system for the controls.   I'm sitting here trying my hardest to find more downsides, but there just isn't much unless I get really, really unecisarily nitpicky. Dragon's overall is a great game. Though there's no choice in the main quest, it's still a true man's RPG in every other part at heart, with awesome fun combat and incredibly well done magic. If you have any love for RPGs at all you'll love Dragon's.  Overall I give it a 10/10. The cons aren't an issue at all and don't make me think negitively of it as it does fine with them, and honestly aren't a degrade to the game's quality, the devs knew what they were doing.",

The game is fun to play and the story while interesting can at times be confusing at certain points. You start out with no fast travel ability. You get that when you reach the first major city and you need it although you also need what are called portcrystals which you can put anywhere and use with the ferry crystal. interesting idea but a horse would have been soooooo much better. Apparently on this world they ate all of the horses or the dragons did maybe and thats why you are hunting them.  You can have up to 3 what are called pawns. (npcs) Which you really do need because most fights are going to have you way over matched. Which is another frustrating part of the game the fights. If you play a mage expect to get hit alot unless your pawns are set to defend which doesn't work always. Getting off spells before you get smashed can be challenging at times especially when there is a large group you have to face.  The controls for the game are not very well laid out. Its a console port and apparently the devs do not own computers because they dont offer you the ability to bind commands to keys. Your stuck with the horrid selections they picked. Want to view your map, well you need to go to a menu screen to pick that, want to save, same, want to check your status, same... not well thought out at all.  The game isn't horrible but just not worth more than $20... if you pay more than that you will feel like you have been robbed.  I like the concept of the pawns in the game and the fact that your pawn can be used by others and you can get the exp they get from these romps with other players.",

            "review_text": "Dragon's Dogma is a game with a lot of promise, and which promises a lot. It falls short on its delivery, however, and the experience you end up with is one of frustration and disjointed confusion. There are strong points, but the weaknesses of the game overshadow the positives in my opinion.  The story is fragmented and you never get a sense of what's going on until the game is over. Some people like that, and I've enjoyed a good story told well with a reveal at the end which fundamentally changes the experience retroactively, but this isn't it. You're not living the story, you're being railroaded through the main questline without ever actually seeing anything happen ingame. Sure there are tons of sidequests and exploring to be done, and if you like that, great, but it's got no impact on the story whatsoever, and you'll never get a feel for the world that is relatable. For me, the first 1/3rd of the game was confusion, trying to piece together what was going on, then the remaining 2/3rds giving up on the story and just playing for the mechanics and achievments. In the end, the world and lore they built felt unsatisfying.  I'd also like to put in my 5 cents regarding the pawn system, the NPC's that fill out your party. Lorewise, having three blank slates makes the party dynamic so flat and dull. This is entirely a personal opinion, but it's very disappointing compared to titles such as Baldur's Gate, Neverwinter Nights, the Final Fantasy's or even Bound by Flame, which is close to Dragon's Dogma in terms of game design.  There *is* information, for the most part, on most of the things you really need to know. However, it's put on you to look up everything yourself, sometimes outside of the game, and sometimes the information you would have needed for the first 3/4ths of the game isn't presented until the last 1/4th, at which point it's useless and you've spent the majority of the game being annoyed about it. This is a personal pet peeve, but to me it's a sign of a poorly designed game when you *have* to do a research project on the steam forums and the wiki just to learn the fundamentals of the game's systems.   The vocation system is reminiscent of Final Fantasy Tactics, where you can level up different jobs who all have different strengths and weaknesses. This is the sales pitch, however there are some vocations that are objectively better and there are vocations that are objectively worse. You're going to have a better time playing sorceror than you will playing mage, for instance.  Combat is an exercise in frustration, trying to be cinematic like the choreographed fight sequences of a movie as well as technical like a boss fight in Demon's souls. In theory, these big monster fights are great, and if you're playing one of the better vocations, they are a lot of fun! However, I played a sorceror. That means there were several fights I couldn't participate in at all. Some monsters are immune to magic, some requires high mobility which isn't compatible to the sorceror's slow and immobile casting style. Some fights even require indirect action against the monsters, that become impossible for you if you're the wrong vocation or lack the right set of skills.  Some fights require you to hit weak spots, and you can't focus fire reliably as a sorceror. At all. You'll have one place targeted, and when you release your spell your character might shoot once towards where you're pointing and then turn around and blow it's remaining charges into a wall, the ceiling or the floor, trying to hit something else entirely. There's nothing you can do about that. Also, sometimes you can't for the life of you get the game to aim at the thing you want to hit, so the monster will be at 1 HP and be invulnerable until you hit that one spot, and you won't be able to because of the wonky targeting. It's really bad for some vocations, further reducing the viability of certain jobs.  Also, unlike Demon's Souls, where you can actually dodge attacks, there are monsters and attacks in Dragon's Dogma that you just can't avoid if you're unlucky. Finally, combat is numbers focused and not skill focused. If you don't have enough attack power, you won't do any damage and it won't matter what you do. There's no making great plays, doing insane dodges and making perfect attacks on weak spots, unless your attack stats are higher than their defense stats.  The AI sometimes has seriously immersive-breaking problems, in two separate but equally annoying ways. Firstly, the game has severe problems with reacting to and traversing the terrain. I've had my pawns trying to jump down a rock, and hurling themselves off a cliff to their death. I've had huge monsters clip through walls and pillars, trying to attack me and failing due to me being techically covered but the AI not realizing and just taking two steps to the side or walking around to damage me. It's fun at first because it's so silly, but once it sinks in that the game will continue like this, it starts falling apart. Sometimes the monsters will reach a spot in the terrain where their pathing screws up, and they'll stand there all bugged out with no recourse for several seconds until they get teleported back somewhere close by. Also, you can be fighting a boss and since you're playing a vocation that's completely useless in that fight, you need to rely on your pawns. This quickly turns sour when the pawns need to hit something that is not the boss and you *CAN NOT* tell them to do so. They say you can design your pawn to act in just about any way you want, that their AI can be molded into just want you're looking for, but that's not true. There are a couple of primary and secondary inclinations that work as guidelines for pawns, but they're clunky and unintuitive, and regardless of how you change them you'll be pulling your hair in frustration when your pawn refuses to do the very specific things that you actually need them for. Dragon Age did this amazingly well, where you could make triggers for your companions to do specific things when the need arose, and I do believe Baldur's Gate had something similar as well. In Dragon's Dogma, however, they are not to be relied upon for anything. ANYTHING. They'll be swinging away at the invulnerable monster and you'll stand there like an idiot, completely impotent in frustration, targeting the object that needs to be destroyed and spamming F1 to try and get them to help out, and being utterly ignored. If you honestly feel like spending hours of research time on the wiki reading up on pawn inclination, know that it's needlessly complicated, not complex or intricate, and it's a ton of boring work for nothing.  This is a game in the same vein as Kingdom's of Amalur and not Demon's Souls, because it's relying on stats and not technical skill in fights. It's designed to be played with certain vocations and not others, and you'll instantly notice the mechanics working against you if you play the wrong way. The monsters look good enough, but that alone doesn't carry the game. The story makes no sense and isn't actually relevant until it's over and you can disect it with perfect hindsight, so the entire game through it's going to be nonsensical. The game doesn't provide the necessary information, causing great frustration when you play. The AI system is adequate at best.  I'd not recommend Dragon's Dogma for it's full price. It's a good purchase at 50% off, IF you're a fan of the genre.",

To be completely honest, it has a lot of potential to be this amazing game where you fight off larger than life monsters, customize your party and character to your unique playstyle, and explore a large world, but it can disappoint. I won't rant about the graphics because of mods and the fact that the game was released 4 years ago (if you are reading this in 2016), but I will point out that this game can be very frustrating. The combat was a higher point for me, but it was hindered by the annoying, repetitive, and very often unhelpful pawn dialouge. Luckily, this can be toned down. Aside from combat, the story is a mixed bag for me. It sounds too cliche at times, but let's be honest, how many people will buy this game for the story. It does get quite philosophical towards the end stretch, but by then I was generally disinterested in this. The story isn't helped by its shallow characters and questionable voice acting. The world was the biggest letdown for me. There are only 2 total cities and the travel times between locations you've already visited feels like a waste. The unlimited sprint mod was a neccessity for me. This is where fast travel would've been a welcome addition. Character customization is good, I like the feature of height and weight. The soundtrack is pretty good, and the DLC area is quite challenging but a welcome sight as it really takes all that was good from the original game.  TL;DR: Dragon's Dogma is a very flawed game, but it is a fun one with high potential. 7/10.",

A very nice day and night cycle that really matters as during the night you pretty much get owned by waves and wave's of enemy's varrying from a pack of 20 wolves to strange will-o-wisp lights acompanied by skelleton hords.  downside: the followers talk way to much, and there is a bug that forces your character to keep running forward even if you are not holding down the button (to fix this just shift+alt to switch from azerty to querty or reverse, and you will be able to run normal again)",

            "review_text": "Ah, my first encounter with the Cyclops.  It was a Late Night. My team was exploring new territories. The sign before did say to stay on the path, but our adventuring spirit, it pushed us to traverse the rocky hillside.  The moonlit waves crashing onto the shore was something we simply couldn’t avoid. So we took that path and ended up climbing up the rocky terrain and hit into a dark forest. The wolves howled at the moon and we readied our weapons. The mage in the party, lit up the place by powering up the magic staff, albeit it didn’t give us that much of an increase in light radius. We really should have re-fueled the lamps while we had the chance. Nevertheless, it was too risky to look for a different path so we simply kept heading straight.  Our sharp ears picked up the sounds of the pack and thus were successful in downing all the wolves that came at us. Because we had long range spells, the cunning wolves that glared at us from behind the trees, their eyes glowing with hunger… well let’s just say that we had no problem in keeping them at bay.  With just the silent Night and the sound of our footsteps keeping us accompany, we felt safe and picked up some pace as we headed into the Night, though always hoping to spot some light source, far in the distance. Soon we did spot something that seemed to be lit, it was actually two things, close to each other. Our adventuring spirit burned bright in us, at the sight.  As we crept closer and came into range, the two burning objects turned out to be some beasts which instantly took flight as we probed them. Their red wings rushed by us and were soon out of reach. We tried aiming our spells at them, hoping to shoot them down but alas it was for naught. Disappointed, we moved on. The darkness had slightly lifted as we could tell from the stream that we had stepped into. The moonlight reflecting on the water was a welcome sight but the path in front was still not that visible.  Our band of merry mages and an archer attempted to step forward, but try as we must, it seemed to us that what felt like a huge boulder, was simply unclimbable. And then it happened. A grumbling sound that shook the heavens around us. From the faint light, reflected off the water’s surface, we witnessed the silhouette of the giant boulder that shifted about all on its own. Before we could even register what was happening, this behemoth had its arms raised high above and roared one more time. Then it hit us, that the thing we could barely make out before wasn’t a large rock but a monster the size of 3 giant men or so.  We turned heel and ran back as fast as our legs could move, cursing the mage’s restricting outfit, thinking that we were slowing down because of the design and not for that fact that actually the giant had, you know, giant legs and arms, thus giving it an advantage. A thunderous crash erupted behind us as the Giant of Giant’s fist sent shockwaves through the ground when it came into contact with it. Somehow avoiding that giant pancake maker gave us the extra boost we needed to get as far away from the monstrosity.  Panting heavily, we stopped in the distance to catch our breath but it wouldn’t be for too long, for the loud thumping wasn’t our heart’s beating fast but the Giant’s feet banging on the ground, much in pursuit of us. Not really knowing where we were, we simply scampered about in any direction, no sooner than later, we found ourselves on a hill top, the Behemoth’s roars could be heard from below. As we carefully took to the edge of the plateau, we spotted the raging monster thrashing about. From this viewpoint, everything was visible to us, no thanks to the moon light shining below.  It was time. We pumped our chests, took out our weapons and aimed at the enemy that we had unknowingly awakened. We didn’t stop till the furious Giant was battered with our spells. Well actually only one of the mage could throw it down as it was the only one who could make it to the farthest point of the hill top and get in range to fire at the Cyclops.  It took some time, but ultimately it was defeated. It may have been a bit mean of us, snickering at the poor beast who was unable to locate us during all the while being bombarded by flaming balls of magic. Even so, once the coast was clear and the humongous, one eyed creature rested in peace, we made our way back down and looted off of him, whatever we could salvage.  The Sun soon came out as we breathed a sigh of relief. Picking ourselves up, the merry adventurers followed the stream uphill and quite soon found ourselves staring at the wooden gates of the close by encampment. Looking at the path, lit by the Morning Sun, we actually had almost made it while we scampered in the dark of Night, it wasn’t that much further from the hilltop from which we trolled the pitiful Cyclops.  X / X ~~ Will Troll a Cyclops, Over &amp; Over Again. Though still get annoyed with getting eaten by a Chimera and Griphon duo, in a dimly lit Forest enclosure, swarming with Lizard Man-Beasts.",

I'll be honest, I think my mistake was trying to play Guts. Playing Melee in this game is really frustrating and the two-handers are especially slow and clunky and don't do enough extra damage to make up for it. Fighting Large enemies exacerbates these issues as they don't stagger easily and there's a good chance that they can chain-CC you simply by walking around. The ones with Wings are even worse due to the extra mobility and the added ♥♥♥♥-you if they decide to never stay on the ground. Climbing enemies is a really cool idea but the implementation is plagued by an unhelpful camera and mysterious controls. Even when you finally clamber over to a place that's actually advantageous, the enemies may just decide that you've ♥♥♥♥ed around long enough and it's time for you to go. The Final Fight with The Dragon is one of the most frustrating things I've ever pushed myself through. Midway through my second attempt, I ended up getting so angry I spiked my controller into the ground and probably would have broken it if I wasn't so weak and tiny. ♥♥♥♥ that thing. I'm glad it's dead.  Pawns are cool and I really like the idea. I would love to see something similar in other games.  Having your Physical Stature influence gameplay mechanics is neat and I think it's actually pretty well implemented.  The Setting is well done and I like the Lore behind certain gameplay mechanics and plot points. If there's one place this game can reasonably be compared with the Souls games, this is it.  The direction in cutscenes and is very Japanese. You'll see it the most when you're interacting with The Duke.  Your character's overall lack of Agency in the story is pretty distressing. There's really only maybe... two meaningful choices you actually get to make in the entire game.  The Graphics are passable considering when the game was made.

They have litterally no personality. It's right there in the game, it tells you this. So why bother with them at all? Why make them human-looking when they could have been awesome golems or robots and still carry the same weight story- and lorewise?   And you can't control them, at all. No scripts like in Dragon Age, no pause -&gt; issue commands -&gt; watch them happen or top down tactical menu for increased battlefield overview and control. Nope, nothing but three different generic commands that don't work.  Shame.  Other than that, I agree to what other people are saying about the 'open world'. Yes, you can explore places... but you will die. There is no visible level indicators on the enemies so, when I wandered off into the wilderness and encountered my first bandits or lizardmen I thought 'Aha, my army of magic Pawn-people and I, the chosen one, can handle this!'. I could not. I was one- or two-shot to death. Again, and again, and again. With no 'quicksave-key' it gets tedious to save all the time you explore in case you suddenly encounter an enemey that is too strong but has nothing to give this away to the player.  There are so many more things in this game that are just poor design choices but I won't go in to them. Instead, if you want to see what people who play it a lot and got invested enough to actually care did, check the mod scene. If you disregard all the nude-mods, most mods involve 'no carry limit', 'no stamina drain when running' and changing the way leveling shapes your character.  Don't buy it. Instead try Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, much better in every way, or The Last Remnant. The Last Remnant has a similar 'not directly controlling your companions in battle' thing, but is better.",

            "review_text": "I haven't really looked into it, but I assume that they didn't beta test this game. there are a lot of flaws. a LOT of flaws. it had promise but they screwed it up.  First issue:  Capcom doesn't know how to make carrying capacity fun. only how to make it realistic. In skyrim, you're able to upgrade your carrying capacity everytime that you upgrade your stamina. in this game, carrying capacity is based off of the weight of the character you made. so if you want carrying capacity that is actually beneficial to you, you have to make a REALLY heavy character, like a giant or something. and nobody wants that (I think). the only other way to get better carrying capacity is to get a certain augment that is specifically for only one of the different types of vocations (classes). so yeah, if you made a small character, you're stuck with 20kg for the rest of the game. you have no idea how many times i've had to pause my game and discard 50% of my things just because both me and my companion are filled to the brim. Things that I want and need might I add.  Second issue:  Stamina. the stamina is absolutely crap. In many other open world games, you can level this kind of thing up. but here you can not. whenever you sprint, you can only sprint for like 15-20 seconds and after you run out of stamina you have to stop and rest for like 3 seconds. it might sound like a small amount but really, in the middle of battle its kind of an issue.  Third issue:  The game is really slow paced. I dont know about you guys, but the thing I like about RPG's is the feeling of improving my skills and leveling up to eventually become a really strong and really unique player. but that sense of progress is non-existant in this game. you can quickly get all the classes (or vocations as they're called) and switch between all of them whenever you want, so the only sense of progress after that is either leveling up (which doesn't give you a sense of progress at all) or getting new gear. and let me tell you, getting new gear is RARE. I mean REALLY RARE. 99.99999% of the time all the gear you get is bought from someone else, you cant find anything really useful outside.  Fourth issue:  throughout the game you get items that say things like 'can be used to craft weapons' or stuff like that. but let me tell you, there is NO way to craft weapons. you can only improve them. you can craft things like potions and stuff through combining materials but thats it. No blacksmithing, no woodworking, no nothing.  fifth issue:  Fast travel? more like, uhh, NO travel. the only thing you can do to quickly go from one side of the map to the other is to get consumables (called ferrystones or warpstones or something like that) and I mean there was one time that I found (I say found, it was just in my inventory one day, could have been there from the beginning) a stone that could be used infinitally, but then theres the issue that you cant really fast travel everywhere. there has to either be a special stone monument in the area that you want to travel to, or you have to find an Item and place the monument down yourself.    This game had a lot of promise. a LOT of promise, like you have no idea how amazing this game could have been. but they screwed it up. they should have had a lot of beta testing done, because thats the only way I can think that they actually left such an incomplete piece of trash out onto the market. if its remade and has good reviews, get it. if it isn't, its not worth your time.",

Yes?  Well here's the suicide hotline for 10 minutes into the game when you're 1 shot by the most basic enemy in the game and you stun yourself while trying to block and avoid damage.'  Seriously ♥♥♥♥ hard mode, that is what artificial difficulty is, if I have to exploit terrain, LOS and essentially am only useful as a high bolide/levin stun bot what is the point?   I wanted to try to play the game as a warrior on hard, but it's literally impossible and that's not a mischaracterization or exaggeration by any means.   The Chimera was the scariest enemy I came across, then I got Bolide and a little lucky and was able to 1 shot it.   Also got super lucky in that my main companion was summoned quite a few times in the first 30 levels so I was able to summon one of the top ranked archemages on the leaderboards.   Pros:  Looks cool  Pretty good story  Magic is done pretty well  Lots of quests  Enemies are easy to find but well spaced enough that you don't accidently aggro a thousand things at once  Save feature is only two buttons   Cons:   Hard mode ruins the game  Reliant on minions that don't really follow commands, eg early in the game my mage would run into the middle of the field get hit and start casting heal to only get massacred where I can't get to her even though I was constantly spamming 'Come' and 'Help'  Takes a really long time to get around if you don't place your portcrystals in ideal spots which you have no idea are ideal until after the fact  How stamina works is the stupidest ♥♥♥♥ing thing I've ever seen in a game ever, and I've play some indie where I have buttons solely dedicated to killing my character causing me to restart.  The main character suffers from stage 5 lung cancer, only has a single lung and very intense asthma.  Melee feels gimp and lack luster compared to the other classes  Melee minions don't cast Springboard   Weight system influences stamina usage and regen heavily but you're required to carry around a lot of curatives and really sucks if you're a character that uses heavy armor, aka any melee  You still have the option to get regular ferrystones (teleport 1 time), even though you get a eternal ferrystone at the start of the game  The Griffin fight as a part of the story was harder to get to than the actual fight itself.   Really don't have a grasp on what level I should be doing the story, the basic enemies will one shot me and take no damage while the bosses die instantly (but they still one shot me)  I've never come across a boss with more abilities than Grigori and I'm pretty sure he doesn't actually have an attack pattern  Deceptive amount of content, afaict all the gear thats actually worth using is in the DLC area where the drops are RNG  I have a lot of crafting materials but nearly 40 hours in and I don't know how or where to craft    There really is a solid reason why only 0.9% of players have finished the game on hard and I doubt I would be one of them.",

            "review_text": "I really can't recommend this game, given how disappointed I am for buying it.  I was playing Oblivion and was looking for a newer game, which wasn't TES nor Fallout, with the same fun. Somebody I believed to be my friend, but now I clearly know he's NOT!, suggested me DDDA as the best game around. Well it's the worst.  First, the companion system. For those who doesn't know the game, it has a nice introduction where we are provided a pre-made char with 3 companions, this intro aims at teaching the basics while providing the feeling of what to expect to the game. It fails on the later.  After the introduction, we create our char. I've seen games with better customization. We're then provided a default companion, so that we can start our jorney. Soon after we reach next city, we create our companion. He is stored on game's cloud, where we can also search for other 2 companions to follow us. We then stay with 4 party members: our char, our companion, and 2 companions from other players.  As advertised, companions are able to learn: strategies for fighting creature types, for exploring areas and how to do quests. They also have a set of exploration and fighting styles, that defines how they walk around us.  That looks awesome. But it's not. Fighting creatures and doing quests isn't challenging at all. As a mage, a simple fireball was enough for me to kill anything I've faced. My companions saw that, and kept yelling 'Fire works well!!!' hundreds and hundreds of thousands of times. That became REALLY annoying, as fire is effective against anything and I didn't even had to care about other spell styles.  As a big fan of Oblivion and Vilja, I was expecting that a game from 2012 enhanced in 2015, focused on companions, would provide me the best I could get in companion technology. Not. While Emma's Vilja (a fan-made mod) is pretty, fun, touching and made me laugh a lot of times, DDDA's companions are boring and annoying. They have just a few phrases to speach, and repeat them too often. None of them are interesting or original.  About quests, they are extremelly boring. There's a board on cities where 'people' (NPCs we never meet) 'place' requests. Almost all of them are to kill stuff, like 40 rabits or 30 undead. Yes, tradicional MMOG quests aimed to make us waste our time and prolong the time we keep paying subscription. At first I tought these quests would just be introductions and would soon end, but they didn't.  In fact, MMOG quests use to ask to loot stuff from corpses and bring back to some NPC. Here, they didn't even bother with that. All quests are on the same board I mentioned and they end as soon as the amount of kills are reached. And corpses can't be looted, loot just falls on the ground.  About the area, graph is very pretty. Shadows are very well defined, I can see on the ground the sunlight that passed thru leaves on trees, making holes on leaves shadows. From upper ground I'm able to see the shape of bodies on their shadows placed on lower ground.  But this is definitely NOT an open world. It's a corridor, a wide one but still a corridor. From the first city, we get to a road with a beach that leads to an outpost. From there we can go either to some area to west, or keep north to game's main city. I wanted to go explore west, but I had no quest there, even the main city has none for there. I had quests only leading to the main city. In fact, if I talk to some person, he'll start moving a caravan there, and I'm forced to follow them to escort. It made me VERY angry that I was forced to go that way, with no option to say I didn't want to!  The main city. That's what made me stop playing the game. WTF! EVERY house was locked, EVERY! And by locked it doesn't mean doors will be opened later or at some time of the day. No, it's just some unmovable door graph that makes sound when we try to interact with it. They will NEVER open as I can tell. WTF!! How can the main city of a game not have indoors!!!  I was still willing to go explore the west area, but quests on main city all sent me to north. I was already very frustrated and angry, with all these flaws and how the game wanted to force me to go to places I didn't want to. So I just stopped wasting my time and went back to Oblivion.  Which, by the way, 10 years ago, has lipsynch even on many fan-made voiced mods. But on DDDA, no NPC as any lipsynch, they just move their mought randomly.  I wish I haven't wasted 30h of my like on this trash and could ask for a refund. Even better, I wish I have never met that person that convinced me to buy this game. I'm glad I'll never ever talk to him anymore after he blocked me!",

            "review_text": "This game is just no good at anything.  Pros:  + Large monsters look good, battling them for the first time is fun + Pawns mechanics is fun + PC development looks fresh, though unexplained in the game.  Cons: - Stats and items mean much more then skill. Farm means success. - The world is dead. NPCs are nothing more then decorations.  - Story is awful. - WOW-like side-quests: kill dozens of rabbits, loot fish from fishing spots, etc - Geography is awful: a single populated island with exactly one fishing village and one capital. Where are other settlements? It's a capital of WHAT? - World logic is awful. There are bandit's forts in unhabited (according to NPC) territories. NPC wander into location hey cannot reach due to monsters, etc. - Battle vs regular mobs is extra repetitive. If you want a fun slasher - go and by a slasher game instead. - Inventory and statistics is just terrible. E.g. one inventory to use items, another to equip weapons/armors. - Only one save slot. You can't have more than one character. Whenb you start a new one - the old one is everwritten.  So-so: = Battle vs regular mobs is fast, but looks like a chore = Fast travel is very limited, this is not bad by itself. But quests make you run around the world here and there a lot. It's so boring and time-consuming = Battle vs large monsters gets very repetitive. After you've defeated it once, killing similar monsters again is boring and takes a lot of time. Running around is more fun than fighting  Summary: If you want a nice logical world - pass by If you want a good slasher experience - buy a slasher instead The battles are very repetitive, unchallenging and unrewarding Dying just makes you load last save (you can save after every encounter) - no Souls experience or challenge You are a PC puring and are used to convenient interface - pass by Trying out large monster is OK and fund for the 1rst couples of time - this is the only positive about this game",

            "review_text": "Very positive...huh...well no accounting for taste. In short, this game is a pile of trash and I can't believe it has this many positive reviews. If you want the longer explanation, well here we go:  First we'll start with the very few things this game doesn't manage to completely massacre  Pro: Music, the music is entertaining and fitting for this style of game it's actually done pretty well.  That's...that's honestly about it.  Con: Lipsyncing, the lipsyncing in this is godawful...it literally looks like every character is cleaning peanut butter out of their mouth whenever they attempt to speak in dialog.  Con: Dialog. No...just no. The dialog in this game is excruciating...I don't think they should have tried to shoehorn in the old speak because it makes the dialog seem about twice as bad. I'm also going to roll the ridiculously annoying pawn dialog into here as well, the pawn dialog is awful...but only half in part because of how cringe inducing the voiceover is, the other half is due to repetition. You will never want to kill your pawns more than when you've heard the same line 500 times in the last hour and a half. 'It's a goblin! Use fire!' Gee...thanks...yes I know, you've only told me this a couple hundred times including twice in the very combat I am still IN right now. And then of course 'Looks like a wall to keep out goblins.' Awesome...cool...do we have to say this line every single damned time we pass by the bloody thing no matter how short the duration inbetween has been?  Con: Animations/Graphics. I'm not quite sure how to articulate this...the graphics for the most part seem alright...but something just feels off about the animations especially concerning NPCs. That and the body proportions in the creator seem incredibly out of whack even for the 'default' body types.  Con: Interface/Ui/Menu/Whatever you feel like calling it. DD:DA Has one of the most disappointing interface's I've ever used, want to get into equipment? Don't go directly to that page, here first sift through our esc menu screen and then go into equipment! Want to check your map? Same problem, on top of the game having an awful quest tracking system. Want to track a quest? Go into the esc menu, go into map, go to quests, click on a singular quest to be able to see the location of that quest and only that quest and then be prepared to do that every single time you want to check that quest or any other quest because there's no permanant marker option.  Con: Map layout/Enemy respawn. The map layout is huge...it's a rather large map, normally that would be an incentive of course but the fact that you get no faster means to traverse said map other than your own feet poses a bit of a problem for one very big reason, respawn. Enemies respawn amazingly fast and in the exact same spot every single time, have fun running a marathon across the continent fighting the same damn harpies and wolves and bandits in the same damned spots which you can't avoid if you want to get anywhere...it becomes really tedious...really really quickly.  Con: Boss fights. Yes yes...I know the thought of jumping on to a giant boss and cleaving bits off of them sounds great in theory, in practice it's amazingly boring. If you want the most efficient way to deal with a boss, don't bother using skills, or ducking and weaving in and out, just jump on them and mash the attack button until they move around too much and your stamina drops beyond a certain point. After your stamina drops to about a quarter, jump off, move around a bit until it regenerates...jump back on the boss and mash attack again, rinse and repeat ad nauseam.  ***SPOILERS, if you actually care.*** Con: Story...or whatever is passing for a story in this game. I'll admit it...I have absolutely no idea what the blazes is going on in the story with this game, first some dragon attacks your village out of nowhere because hey whatever dragons do that or something. Then your character charges the dragon wearing pajamas and wielding a sword...and predictably gets their ♥♥♥ handed to them. After which the dragon proceeds to eat your characters heart or something and turn you into...I don't know, super zombie? Anyway, his reasoning for this is something about wanting to fight your character or something as if he hadn't already wiped the floor with you. So from the start we're on this rollercoaster of a quest because the main antagonist decided he wanted a dysfunctionally abusive relationship buddy, maybe it's the only way he feels loved I don't know. So we fast forward from that and now the pawns magically appear out of nowhere with little to no explanation...they're pawns, they have no feelings of their own and they follow you because of...some reason or another which isn't explained either. Alright we're 0 for 3 on explanations of what the hell is going on and we're not even through the second hour. ***End of SPOILERS***  Con: Skills(at least for the fighter class, though none of the skills my strider or wizard pawns were using seemed all that hot either). This game has to have the most boring skills I've ever seen and arguably the most useless. I of course started as a fighter, sword and board...grrr and arrr and all that. So first off, primary attack(left mouse) is just simple quick slashes of the weapon, while secondary attack(right mouse) is a forward thrust with the point of the sword. Two of the skills available to me are just variations of the forward thrust secondary attack albeit with slightly longer range, another skill is a set of three shield 'taps' I hesitate to call them bashes because they feel about as threatening as being hit with a soggy pastry and do less damage than your primary attack, there's almost no point in using this skill. Then I had a skill where I slapped my sword on my shield two or three times...and that's about all the information I actually have on that skill as I couldn't find a single use for it, was it a buff? I didn't see one...was it a taunt? Enemies ignored me as much after as before so if it was a taunt it was the worst one in history. And the last skill which I actually gave a rats about learning was some backstep and broad slash sideways with the sword, at least it's something other than a thrust right? Still useless unfortunately, I just stuck to spamming primary attack and oddly enough that worked out rather swimmingly.  In conclusion, this game is a travesty and I have absolutely no idea why it has the positive reviews that it does...either everybody else has brain damage or I was apparently playing the wrong game and need to ask Steam why they gave me 'Dragon's Dogma: Kill it with fire.' instead of the actual game. Regardless, stay away from this game...very very far away.",

            "review_text": "Maybe it's just me but I couldn't get into this game.  My main complaints? For one, the combat is actually not that good... it's very hack and slashy (not in a good way) with little to no actual mechanical difficulty. You can block an attack with your shield but you can't actually counter attack, they just break your block and you fall back a bit and then they manage to attack you as your guard is down and probably kill you. You're better off not shield blocking and just running around like a headless chicken to avoid damage.   You can't roll, you can't dodge. If you sprint in combat your character just puts away his weapon like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and runs. Even when the combat was fun it quickly got very boring spamming the same moves over and over again on enemies that have a metric ♥♥♥♥ ton of health.   Moving on from the combat, the next big complaint is the save system. Auto saves and checkpoints are few and far in between, and punish exploration. There is no quicksave (like pressing F5), so if you ever want to 'quick save' you have to manually press ESC, go to the menu, save and continue, then ESC back into the game. Tedious and very annoying.   What does that mean? Well it means that if you get immersed in the world while exploring and forget to save your game, you could explore for 30 minutes, and then stumble on a really hard pack of bandits or something, fight your heart out, die, and then find out that you have to backtrack to your last save which was 40 minutes ago. Yeah no thanks I'd rather exit the game at that point.  Lastly, there is no fast travel in this game, again making the mundane tasks of go talk to this guy and then come back to me, very very annoying.   I honestly don't understand the hype here, it's a mediocore RPG with a mediocore story and repetative non-engaging gameplay. Thank god for steam refunds.   Save your money.",

            "review_text": "Great port with few problems during the transition from the console to the PC. Problem, however, lies with the game and not the translation.  Pros: + Mostly Open world-ish. Has clear boundaries and seems a bit linear mapwise. Not completely organic but that's okay. + Alright combat system. Nothing innovative except for climbing on enemies and aiming at vitals. + Graphics are fine. For a Japanese developed game, its not bad at all considering that most japanese games have terrible textures and graphics compared to western developed games. Not that I care much for graphics however. + Character creation is okay. Not spectacular but very functional. + Art direction is superb. Probably the reason why the developers working on the PC port decided to make the walking speed so slow so that players can 'enjoy' the view. A bad decision but the Art is good.  Cons: - Walking/Running not optimized for PC. Walking is too slow, slower than NPC walking speed and serves no purpose. Running is too fast and makes it difficult to grab items or heal teammates on the run. Sprinting is okay however. - Pawn AI -&gt; Very annoying from constant talking. Obvious Japanese fetish for 'Master, master, master, my master!'. Pawns are also quite useless in-game as well and have pathing problems when the player issues an order. - Artificial difficulty. Typical of Japanese games, though not confined to only Japanese games, increased difficulty raise enemy health, defense and damage output and does nothing to actually make the enemy more difficult to handle. It makes it difficult but not in a way that is realistic or fun. (Can you imagine dying from a bat hitting you once or twice? I can't either. Or what about that half naked human who can somehow take in 100+ hits and kill you in a single stab? Fun?) - Progression is very linear. This is more evident in Hard Mode than in Normal or Easy Mode. The Player has to tackle quests/exploration in a clearly defined order with no variations or interfering variables (Other than the player killing off important quest characters).  - Lack in weapon variety. Axes? You're out of luck. Spears? Ha, keep dreaming. Crossbows? Nah, forget those.  Subjective Criticisms - Strict, cookie-cutter classes. This one is more or less subjective but in this day and age, confining the player to a certain set of equipment and skills is outdated and it ruins the immersion to a certain degree. Not to mention that the 9 vocations available are actually quite bland and vanilla. - Too Japanese-y for a game with heavy western influences. Granted that a lot of the lore are actually based off of Japanese pop culture, I still felt uncomfortable with some armor pieces and other items in-game.   What actually drove me nuts to the point where I just had to write a negative review were the Pawns. Their terrible, atrocious AI and pathing combined with their frequent [master-slave] fetish quips was just too much to bear.",

            "review_text": "Don't miss out on this game. I was very hesitant to buy this game, but boy am I glad I did buy it. This game is fantastic, and with a couple graphics mods, this game is outstanding. Short review to hopefully convince anyone on the edge here.  Combat: 10/10. Similar to most Rpg games out there, with the typical classes and weapon/magic system. Dragon's Dogma somehow stands out from other games in this category though. The combat is just ridiculous fun in this game, even when you're just taking down some low level wolves blocking your path. The bigger monsters are no walk in the park though, and even with my level 37 sorcerer, some of them make for long (enjoyable through every second) battles. There are so many different ways to take down the monsters too. It's not always just about hitting them as much as possible to bring their hp to zero. I've spent many hours just traveling the world to see what kind of new creatures I can find, something I rarely do in games because I usually get bored. Dragon's Dogma keeps it interesting though.  Graphics: 8/10 with mods. This is the only aspect of the game in my opinion that is lacking. The graphics are of course a little bit dated, but they can be improved. I installed a new texture pack and a sweetfx preset, and now the game looks great. It's still not fantastic, but it is much better than vanilla. I'd recommend that for everyone, especially if you're starting a new playthrough. This isn't a cheat or hack, so hopefully this part is allowed in here.   Voice/Sound: Voice-7/10, Music-10/10. The music is outstanding, I just wish there was more of it. For the first time since the Witcher 3, I don't need to play spotify in the background when i'm playing this game. The music really improves the feel and atmosphere. Every time you come across a big monster, the game is sure to let you know by the change of music, in a good way too. The choices here are better than any game I can remember, and really adds to the already fantastic gameplay. Voices are subpar in my opinion, I've heard much better (The Witcher 3) and I've heard much worse (Too many games to list). They are not bad by any means though, and do not diminish the gameplay at all.  Crafting/Buying/Selling: 8/10. Dragon's Dogma does not include a weapon crafting system, but they do have a good system for enhancing weapons, which becomes very important in the game. Every weapon or piece of armor needs certain materials to be upgraded, and some are very tricky to come by. I think this system incorporates into the game perfectly. It's not overly complicated and is easy to figure out, but still has enough depth to keep it interesting. You can buy weapons and armor from most merchants, whether they're in a city or on the roads. Although with all of the exploring i've done, i've found much better equipment out in the world as opposed to at the merchants. The way it should be imo.  All in all, this game is outstanding. 9/10. I highly recommend it. I have almost 30 hours into the game, and I think i've only scratched the surface. This game is huge.",

Fun, exciting, versatile, smooth, and of course the right difficulty. +++ Rewarding loots from battles, dungeons and treasure chests.  +++ Plenty of unique and exciting bosses to find all over the lands and dungeons you can fight over and over and over again. Dark Arisen alone has plenty of amazing super bosses you can defeat for great rewards.  +++ Extremely fun and rewarding upgrade system, that the more you play, the more addicting it becomes. I've clocked in 600+ hours on this game and still loving every minute of it. ++ Best magic effect in forever.

My only real gripe is the leveling system, which may actively ♥♥♥♥ you for playing a class that you like. The game has a level cap of 200, and your stats grow a fixed amount on every levelup, determined by the class you're playing. If you wanted to play magick archer, for example, you'd mainly want to increase magick attack. But magick archer has a dumpster MA growth of 3, compared to the sorcerer's 6, so to optimize you'd have to play a class you don't want to. Honestly though, this is a minor issue because endgame weapons make any suboptimal build do respectable damage. It's just that I've some OCD issues.  TLDR Wolves hunt in packs.",

Its trying to be alot and while it doesnt succeed at everything its still glorious. Combat is spot on, intense, and regardless of which vocation (class) you choose, is fun and makes you feel like a F****n bad***. Map size is perfect for what it is, small enough that i enjoy running across land to get to my next location without fast traveling, but large enough that it doesnt seem overly repetitive. This coming from someone who's clocked a fair amount of time into the game so far (50 hours) and plans on spending a lot more time in it.   The game, despite being about 4 years old, still looks great, and the visual effects are beautiful. The boss/giant monster fights are fun, and for awhile pretty scary, but after awhile you realize your a Griffin slaying machine and kill everything. the design for the creatures and the environment is, I personally think, superb.  But, as inall games, there are negatives. The story, while i personally got invested into it, was a bit lackluster and i would've liked to see more depth to the characters and conversational options: ie Dragon Age: Inquisition. And those Damn wolves and harpies, not challenging but just outright annoying! Nothings worse then when your fighting a Chimera and a F****g direwolf comes and pins you down like the little A**hole he is.

That's saying something, what with the original Dragon's Dogma being four years old when it originally hit the consoles. And to top it off, it's a great PC port: the controls are good whether you use keyboard and mouse or a gamepad, and while the graphics are slightly dated the framerate is stellar.  Dragon's Dogma is the antithesis to RPGs where you hit giant monsters in the foot one hundred times with your strongest attack till they drop dead and hope you can tank them long enough to win that way. You instead use tactics to exploit weaknesses, grapple foes, climb onto large monsters, throw enemies off of cliffs, stun them with well-timed counters, and many other tricks. The result is a very cinematic combat that is fluid and always feeling organic, and without ever taking control away from you by turning these epic combat moments into cheap quick-time events, as it would be typical of similar games. The game gives you the tools and lets you make the magic happen.  Adding to that, you have a fairly large environment to explore. You can freely switch between several different class archetypes typical to other RPGs and try out anything from melee, archery, to magic vocations, and they all have very satisfying features and controls that make them all enjoyable to try out and play.  Aside from everything else, a unique and interesting feature that sets this game apart from others in the genre is the pawn system. You get to design an A.I.-controlled companion that accompanies you on your adventures, and can hire others from a pool of pregenerated ones and those built by other players, including your friends. The pawns become more intelligent with experience, learning new tactics against enemies and how to solve quests, and will help you and other players accordingly. This adds a fascinating layer to the game as you can coordinate pawn setups, personalities, and strategies with friends, and trade or gift items with other players via this system.  The game can have a slow start, but Dragon's Dogma is a game that needs to be experienced and rewards you with a great time if you tough out the early game, as its main attractions and unique features surface and come together as you progress, and they're what make it stand out from other action RPGs.  The only truly bad thing about this game? It will spoil you towards the combat systems in action RPGs in general. Most others will feel a bit unsatisfying in comparison once you've sunk your teeth into this one.",

            "review_text": "having played this game on ps3 a lot when it first came out, i was beyond excited to learn that this game was coming out on steam. i played it through about 1.5 times when i bought it for pc. my favorite part was getting to explore bitterblack isle as i did not have the dlc when it was on ps3. i would definitely recommend it to anyone who is a fan of open world RPGs. i'm not sure what others have said in their reviews, or really where to start with this game as it's been out for a few years and there's plenty of other information available on this game. i guess i'll just state a few of the things i liked most about it. first, there's the big ♥♥♥ monsters. i love climbing and fighting the monsters in this game. from the gryphons, to the dragon, the cyclopses, and the cockatrice-the varying AI and the way each reacts to you climbing around on it and hacking away. it's unlike anything i've seen in another game.  then there's the professions to choose from and the different moves lists and equipment that can be used depending on which you choose. with 6 main professions to choose from and 3 hybrid classes that can only be used by you, there are many different playstyles to choose from and several tactical approaches to take for each enemy or boss to fight. lastly, there's the pawn system that i want to touch on. every time you rest at an inn, you create a checkpoint save and update your pawn's attributes to the server for others to use. building a 4 person crew out of you, your pawn, and 2 pawns from friends is a blast and a tough tactical decision. since pawns can only pick from one of the main 6 classes, it sort of forces you to make sure you have a party member for each type of scenario or enemy you might run into.  i feel like i'm not doing this game proper justice, but i also don't want to go on a long rant where i basically say the same thing everyone else is. just buy the game if you want a great open world action RPG and don't care so much for the story. (i'm not saying the story was bad, just that it was never the reason i came back to or kept playing the game-it was always the gameplay and the world itself.) gransys is amazing. and the new enemies (new to me, anyway) on bitterblack isle added a slew of new items, gear, etc for me to collect and use",

Maybe I lack some self control, but I had the time and this game is GOOD.   Scratches that Action RPG sweet spot that rare games like Dark Messiah of Might and Magic have reached, and further. Takes the best parts of the typical Elder Scrolls gameplay and makes the open world fantasy experience even more enjoyable with many varied enemy types and player classes. It's quite possibly the only game I've played that makes this happen with a useful party system, too.   It isn't flawless though - the characters and animations throughout the cutscenes can be a little wonky (mainly camera work and too much gesturing while talking, voice acting is also spotty in some sections). The main character seems to spend pretty much every cutscene dumbfounded at literally anything that is happening, despite being able to command powerful allies and take down eldrich abominations. Those are small gripes though for a game this solid.   In terms of visuals, the world is clearly a product of a well researched team. The majority of armors and equipment resemble real world pieces from the middle ages, and most of the combat options for non-magical classes are grounded in real-world techniques. The magical classes themselves do use a system that is believable, with spells taking time to prepare and more effective combinations taking time to set up, but they do pay off. Although there are only two main cities, they are both large enough to concievably be functional cities. Dungeons FEEL like dungeons, and this game is the first game since Dark Messiah (for me) to really give that kind of a strong atmosphere. The first time you encounter an undead just lingering in the darkness of a hallway is simply magical. Few games ever do bring that uneasy feeling of finding another human-shaped being in an abandoned place. Although perhaps the world is a bit small compared to other titles like this, the development team clearly chose quality over quantity and I would take that any day.   Here's hoping for a sequel.",

SUMMARY 4 out of 5 (+)fast travel included (+)fun combat (+)story (=)fast travel is janky (-)waypoints could be better (-)endgame dungeon/DLC dungeon areas and consumable item spam.  FULL REVIEW  This game is Capcom's stab at an open world game.  A few things to know for starters is that you cannot craft weapons with materials you obtain (they are for upgrades) and that in your storage box there is an eternal ferrystone that gives you infinite charges to warp to certain fast travel locations.   I tried playing this on PS3 but did not play it much because the lack of fast travel and when it came to PC it was a welcomed addition.   The fasttravel is a bit janky, a couple of the main locations have them builtin. You collect a few(I collected 3) portcrystals that you throw into the ground on the overworld to create a fast travel point; you can also pick them up if you need to move them to a better spot.   There is a bit of inventory management but not as much as I had expected. There are items that heal your group and self target. You cannot use healing self target items or self use items on any character but yourself, you give them to the NPCs and hope they use them.   You will find yourself saving often after skirmishes. Hit start and then select/back button(xbox 360 controller)  The pawn system where you created your buddy and then summon two more buddies from other players on occasion is a good idea but it was also a bit weird because I had to summon different guys because they did not level up and they were disposable.  Some areas in the game and the DLC become a dungeon grind with random monster appearance and the usage of the same types of rooms over and over. I did not play much of the DLC but I would compare the areas similar to chalice dungeons in Bloodborne.   They added a bunch of new monsters (30?) in the DLC dungeon that I would have preferred sprinkled into the actual world instead of the samey looking castle dungeon areas.   The actual world of Dragons Dogma has a lot of encounters outside and is far less empty that other open world games.   The waypoints are generally good for quests but sometimes they send you to a location and you have to look around a bunch when you actually get there or they are on a different elevation on the map and finding the actually location becomes confusing or the waypoint spot is correct but you have to return at a different time of day trigger the scene.   The combat was pretty fun, I played a melee class usually sword and board style class, sometimes daggers, and a bit of 2-handers. The combat is a little mashy but there is enough there to keep it from going stale with new skills and combo upgrades, climbing enemies, and changing classes/weapons. A charge/dash skill is highly recommended.   Climbing on large enemies to target weak points is a fun thing to do. There wasn't much to do besides move and stab but it is something that a lot of games still do not do this day and age. I did use it a lot and liked it because as a melee character I got to reach the weak points that normally would be inaccessible unless I had ranged items.   You can see some of the monster hunter(maybe?) in the game when it came to gathering, combining, and mining as well as knocking off some of the parts of the larger enemies(ogre). I felt that the red flying dragon could have been a Rathalos. The zombie enemies look like they could be in a Resident Evil game. The monsters by design are more fantasy based(DnD) and less outrageous than in MH.  There was more story beats in the game than I expected and cut scenes.  This is a game I had backlogged for a long time. I am glad I got around to playing it. It was a shorter game than expected but the story and combat was a step up from most open world games. The world while not huge it did have a nice amount of enemy density. While it is not without its problems I do hope they one day revisit the world of open games and create another one of these.",

The towns seem set in stone while the npc that walks around town does the same thing day in and day out and buildings and pubs are dead even if npc are standing there or sitting there. You just feel like you're alone in the game unlike dragon age and skyrim. While both dragon age and skyrim are masters in variation in the npc behaviours and environment aspect of the game but Dragon's Dogma does have features that both those games missed. Like pawns feature in Dragon's Dogma is similar to the companion feature in other games but pawns are set up and created just like the players themselves where you can create their looks and pick their skills. Pawns are npc but are customizable. Another thing is that you can switch from classes or what they call vocation without even needing to start the game over again which is sometimes annoying in games such as Dragon Age where you can't switch classes halfway through the game.  Dragon's Dogma does use a lot of terms from Dragon's Age and Skyrim, like dragonbane which can make it feel like a cheap imitation but the contents is not bad. The game cannot compare to Dragon's Age and Skyrim's maps in term of size and variety but even so it's an overall good game to try. If you are trying to find a game that similar but better than both these two masterpieces than you maybe disappointed but it still does a good job in terms of massive rpg game.",

            "review_text": "I had no expectations of this game going in; it looked like fantasy combat fun and I got it during the steam summer sale. That being said, 100 hours later I'm in love with this game, and I have no idea how I missed it when it originally released.  The game is by no means perfect, and there are obvious issues which I'll describe. But, the most important thing to me for a game is, did I have fun playing it? Yes. Yes I did (for 100 hours).  At it's core this game is a fantasy exploration/quest/loot finding game that I would compare to say, Skyrim. The gameplay is make a character, explore the map, do some quests, chase the storyline, and pick up some awesome loot while you do it. The map is much smaller than Skyrim or other 'open world games' and doesn't have random dungeons etc. But it makes up for it with just absolutely dynamic, fulfilling gameplay. All the classes are viable, and you can swap throughout gameplay. The combat is JUST FUN. It's well executed, smooth 3rd person combat. Archery is great, daggerfighting is fantastic, magic is wonderful with various spells other than fireball/bigger fireball. The bosses in the game are large enemies, and for a change you can crawl all over them and stab them as you cling on for dear life.  FIghting gigantic enemies never got old, and different monster types really do have different strategies which felt great! If I got a little bored all I did was swap weapon syle and it was a whole new ball game. The DLC dungeon was very difficult, and made me feel guilty for thinking the game got too easy (9 eliminators, 2 wyverns and a cursed dragon at the same time?!) The loot/gameplay in the DLC was fantastic overall, and I spent a great amount of hours going through that content.  A quick plug for the DLC! Dark Arisen was the DLC for Dragon's Dogma, and it adds several items that I imagine made life way easier (permanent item that enables fast travel, for example, where the original game had consumables). I imagine pre-Dark Arisen there were more problems with the game.   Then, mix in the fact that you get a party in the form of a designed main companion, and then up to 2 other companions that you can recruit from other players' main companions! This was awesome seeing the gear, abilties, and strategies of other players companions, and you can get new ones all the time. It was a little frustrating at first figuring out how to make my companion effective, as their actions are guided by primary/secondary 'inclinations' or behaviors. You can easily change it in game, once you figure out you should do so, and then you get some highly effective AI support!  The story didn't seem that big when I started, and it might sound weird but it REALLY ramps up in the post-game. I know, weird, but trust me, I felt like I got a legitimate pay off when I got to the actual true ending.   Now to cut the positive enthusiasm here and talk about bad stuff.  Graphics are... okay. I highly recommend picking up a mod that enchances them. It looks a bit better, but the focus is really on gameplay. I will say I also downloaded a mod compilation to handle quality of life things like free sprinting (to make traveling easier) and carrying capacity increases (there is a LOT of material/junk loot that can eat up inventory).  Inventory management can be overwhelming. There is a system to combine items to make new ones, but you can't craft actual arms and armor (just enhance them). There is a lot of monster parts/collectables and at first it feels like everything is important.  The main city feels dead. Not much NPC interaction, not much going on there. It's a common stop as it's your hub for inventory/purchasing/resting/skill changes etc.  Some might complain about map size. I'll mention that it FEELS big at first, but really isn't. I didn't notice until I had played for awhile, and every area gets used for questing so I don't think it's a huge deal.  Loot. Okay, they have lots of loot and getting new things is VERY rewarding. However, in a singleplayer game it's odd to have random loot %'s on chests. The loot is predetermined, so you can look up where an item that you want is. However, you probably won't get that item at first. Instead of waiting for chests to respawn, you can save/reload to try again. You might do that... many times. It's frustrating because it's time consuming, and since you can just save scum it I often wondered why the game couldn't just give me the item I wanted.  Grievances aside. What a game. I loved every hour of it, and I had FUN playing it. Sure, there are 'better' games in terms of graphics/size and so on. This may not have that, but it certainly delivered a HIGHLY enjoyable experience!",

Your battles can't always be won by sheer willpower and no thought, you'll have to think for quite a bit of them. The Pawn system is by far one of the coolest things in this game. Basically you get to create your sworn companion and adventure with them and what not. The cool thing is, is that you can summon another players' Pawns and have them come along with you on your adventure, same thing goes for your Pawn. When they get summoned by someone they will learn things that they didn't know before (like how to kill a certain enemy). When they get sent home they will be rated by the other player, and may possibly send you a gift as well.  Overall Score: 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "No complaints. Perfect game, yo.  Coolest parts of the game:  Combat and Classes - it's just a really exciting experience. Every skill looks and feels amazing. Climbing is pretty sweet too. It's a very rewarding combat system. Killing things makes you feel like a cool guy, killing bosses makes you feel godlike. Honestly I'd get this game just because of its unique combat system. The classes are great too. You got the generic fighters/mages/sneaky. There is a total of 9 vocations (classes). Don't underestimate any of them. They all hold immense power. Don't think one is better than another. Another cool part of the classes is being able to switch at any time. You are not locked onto any class. Finally, one of the greatest parts of the classes are the Hybrid vocations. You wanna use magic and be a knight? You can do that. Wanna be an archer and use magical arrows? You can do that. Wanna be a sneaky assassin-like knight that can go invisible and kill things at the speed of light? You can do that too.  Pawns - Personally I loved this part of the game cause I was able to make my friend into a follower in a game :D. How cool is that? I can make them act they way they act in real life too. Having a trusty and loyal companion gives the game emotion. It's really fun fighting along a smart AI version of your friends :3  The Dragon - the dragon isnt a giant lizard. It's an actual colossal fire-breathing beast. The boss fight was absolutely grand. I enjoyed fighting this guy. Especially with how cool the combat system is and how you can have pawns fighting with you makes it even more epic. Much better than the Skyrim/Dark Souls dragon fights. It really isn't just hitting a dragon over and over again in one spot. You gotta be strategic, hit his weak points. You gotta hide from his fire breath, you can't just take it. You gotta make sure your three pawns are safe, strength in numbers.   BitterBlack Isle - Lovely place! If you enjoyed the challenge of Dark Souls, you'll enjoy the challenge of this place. This place has it's own cool little story with it. The lore of this place is really interesting. As great as this place is, it legit scared me. The music there... seeing the demonic beasts... really spooky. I remember walking around, minding my own business, when a minotaur decided to charge at me and knock me off a bridge. I thought I was having a heart attack... But seriously this place was designed awesomely. It really gives you the feeling you're in a very dangerous place.  Basically, if you like skyrim or any of the souls games, you'll like this game.  10/10",

Pawns are very helpful, they heal, buff, taunt and even offer advice for your current quests or locations. They are surprisingly smart and makes you think it's an actual player. One time a mage pawn i summoned jumping around trying to avoid the bandit sword strike, it was pretty hilarious. It's very unique system. - Combat, oh boy do i love the combat in this game. It's really meaty and satisfying, especially when fighting big ♥♥♥ monsters such as cyclops and gryphon.(i recommend Hard Mode even on your first playthrough) - Character creation, lots of costumization for your Arisen and your pawn from skin color, heigh, weight, voice, hair etc. - No more JRock tune on Main Menu.  Cons - Much of the NPC are somewhat dull, but they do have a unique names. - Visuals are bit outdated, but its easily remedied with visual mods such as ENB and SweetFX.

The world is huge and immersive, the combat is fun and rewarding and the monsters are fun to fight and their abilities are spread enough to keep each fight interesting. The story is pretty neat, the only issue is some long runs if you are not smart about your portcrystal placement.  The ability to climb all over the large monsters makes the combat much more dynamic and fun. The option of changing your class whenever you want is also a great feature!

There are hardly any other games that will allow you to climb monsters and/or beasts of monumental proportions (size) and bring them down by doing so.

The creatures are way cooler in this game, they're pretty cool too in Dark Souls but the ones in Dragon's Dogma are much, much more better but once again, that's my opinion. Both games are pretty dark, set in a dark fantasy world but for some reasons, Dragon's Dogma does it better. The story, the open world, everything. The gameplay is the greatest asset about this game, if you compare it to Dark Souls, it is way much more responsive in this game, it is way smoother and it can be played greatly with a keyboard and a mouse, try to play the first Dark Souls with a mouse and a keyboard, it is not smooth at all. Of course, the map isn't better than the one in The Witcher 3 and the 'The Elder Scrolls' titles in term of freedom but it is sure really great, the details are beautiful. The music is really great, it has the dark fantasy vibe to it and a really good one while at it.  This game is certainly worth 40$ unlike the overpriced crap they sell at 110$ (looking at you Ubisoft, Activision, EA Games, ...)  The comparisons I have made with Dark Souls are only comparisons with the first game since I have not enough played the second game and not played the third at all yet.

Pawns. you create a NPC character (pawn) in addition to your own character, and you customize his/her class/abilities/gear as well. you can also take on up to 2 other pawns for your party. these additional pawns are taken from a database that stores every player's main pawn. you're probably gonna want at least one pawn to heal you (tho you could just wharf down curitives like a madman instead).  Fast travel? mentioning this here because it took me a bit too long to realize this myself. there is fast travel, but you need to place the travel points (portcrystals) yourself. it also apparently required a consumable items (ferrystones) in order to fast travel to these locations, but this updated version of the game grants you an 'eternal ferrystone' (that can be reused indefinitely) very early on.

When this came out for PC I was so ecstatic I could barely contain myself. What suprised me even more was on how well a port this is. I've never used the PC controls but from what I've gathered from people that do use them they are quite good, I personally perfer a controller and doing everything with a controller was how the game was meant to be played. The controls are fluid and responsive and combat never gets old. Every hit is satisfying, with hard hitting attacks the game breifly pauses for emphasis on how big of an attack you are doing. The magic system is bold and powerful and is very satisfying to use/see. The story is about average and I never really cared a whole lot for it. I understand most of it and I appreciate it for what it is but I couldn't really care less. That's not to say that its bad, just not the main reason why I love this game. The progression in this game is spot on where there's always somewhere for you to go next for a challenge/♥♥♥ whoppin'. The class system allows for a flexible play style, whether you want to be a giant sword wielding badass or a quick agile dagger wielding assassin wrecking havoc on everything in site. The loot is rewarding to find and getting that one peice of armor or that weapon you've been going after for an hour is satisfying and actually means something. After you complete the 'end' of the game a whole nother area opens up that is ripe with loot and challenge. The world gets signifigantly harder and the best loot in the game can be aquired. The Ur-Dragon (A post 'end' game boss) is fun to fight and can certainly give you a run for your money, while the loot you get from him is the best in the game excluding the Dark Arisen equipment. Speaking of Dark Arisen, I just finally finished it after having this game for a multitude of years and I have to say, Bitterblack Isle is hard. The enemies will kick your teeth in if you are not prepared and the whole place is dark and eerie. The DLC will take a while to get to because the minimum level I would reccomend you be before even attempting it would be 60, which is post 'end' game content. The final fight for the DLC is hard and rewarding and the loot you get from it is amoung the best in the game. I've dumped over 55+ hours on one save, beaten the game twice, and just completed the DLC and I'm no where near done playing. The amount of side quests are rediculous and completly opptional, but highly rewarding. I'm only level 83 while the level cap is 200. I have so much more to do and yet I keep coming back to this game. If you are looking for a game with great RPG elements, a fantastic party system, tons of gear, tons of replayability, and loads of content then look no further than Dragon's Dogma.",

But beyond that, the pawn system is awesome, the combat superb, the story meh--but passable, and the open world is alright. The game is a solid 8/10 in my book, well worth the $12 i got it for on humble bundle.",

            "review_text": "Dragon's Dogma stands out as one of the game's that I wish I'd played sooner. The medieval fantasy setting pits you against monsters from realms of fantasy and mythology: human enemies join griffins, chymera, dragons, harpies, ogres and goblins to name just a few.   The battle system is especially good, allowing the player to fight in nearly any style they'd wish, while also encouraging you to try a wide range of playstyles. You can set yourself up as a heavy-armoured warrior, mage, rouge/ ranger type, stealth specialist, or any combination thereof. The pawn system supports this, as you can choose new pawns that compliment your current playstyle at an town or city.   If I were to choose my issues with the game, I'd have to say that the 3rd person camera leaves something to be desired, especially in battle situations. In close or crowded situations, it can get hung up on the surroundings. The game also isn't the prettiest in terms of color scheme and texture quality, and it's locked at 60 fps, but the gameplay and the scale of the world (it's not 'open', but it is huge... which can make travelling for quests a pain) make up for the shortcomings.   I've only just gotten the game on PC, but played around 100 hours on Xbox 360. It looks WAY better on PC.",

The combat feels immersive and has enough unique classes and combat styles to appeal to pretty much anyone. Character customization is still one of the best out there. The story is actually interesting and might surprise you. The game lets you play through the story over and over on the same character, which is really important to me. The soundtrack is fantastic, and I find myself listening to it on its own all the time. Dark Arisen adds a dungeon that you can spend hours and hours playing with one of the best bosses I've seen in a game.",

There are elements that reminded my a lot of Final Fantasy 12 but I guess the first three games mentioned earlier probably won you over already. Plus, this game has the words MAJESTIC written all over it, from the art directing all the way to score and sound design, this game just does its job right.   INTERESTING THINGS ABOUT THE GAME:    Lemme talk about character customization for a sec. In this game, character customization is very dynamic, there are actually a lot of simple factors that affect your character's performance that won't appear in your stats, simple things like your character's weight can actually affect how much stamina you consume or how much items you could carry in your pack and so on... There are a lot more hidden variables like this and they're not a bothersome to think too much about, that's how balanced this game is.   ",

Now, everyone loves a good boss battle, especially one with a narrative and this game most certainly delivers. You won't be disappointed with the gameplay here, lots of hackin slashing goodness with the best spell casting system that this genre has ever seen(literally). I would say this game is one of those, that if you've been a long time fan of games like dark souls, devil may cry, kingdom hearts even, that this game has what you're looking for and more. I'll finish off with this, I find the game a little grindy in terms of traveling around the world map. You'll understand when you start and that also, alot of the best parts of the game happen to be in post game. That being said, its a must buy title. Good luck and git rekt",

Worst part about the game was the start, save and quit time. Too many menues and loading screens and no quicksave.   Played a mage for 10 mins.. Horrible...auto aim lock on target, no aim control on primary range staff attack. You can shoot in the direction you're facing but it's not a smooth transition or feesable in combat because you can't change the vertical direction. You're pretty much stuck using the auto lock on for the primary weapon. Secondary range attacks can be controled by holding X (can change controls) and a mouse button. It zooms into FPS (or close 3ps) with a large red fuzzy dot inside of a large thick red circle site. It looks bad and feels clunky. I'm sure people can get used to it, but I personally won't play any game with lock on targeting and I dislike the ranged site look.   I'm going to start overs as a fighter. Havn't tried the ranger type charter yet but I'm assuming the ranged attack similiar.   Changed class to a Paladin and I couldn't swing my weapon overhead.... Broken class. Game got boring real quick.",

It has so much attention to detail from character customization,combat,world/level design,NPC interactions and enemy design that it just impresses.  I would class this game as a 3rd person perspective ARPG &lt;action role playing game&gt; which is similar to Skyrim/Dark souls for example but it definteley has it's own personality and I prefer it thus far to both titles already mentioned.  The fanatasy setting is kinda 'ye olde dark ageish' with castles , griffons , orcs , knights etc and wow, the game designers have really done an outstanding job (must have been soooo much work to create this game) in giving the world a sense of scale that many other similar games fail to achieve.  I'm runing this game max settings on a Geforce 1080, i7 4770k and you actually feel like you are approaching a massive castle or moving through a thick forest etc rather than in a limited budget or hardware restricted enviroment.Can only really criticise the sky at night whch looks off a bit but it doesn't detract from the experience for me much at all.  The combat is very good (I think their is 9 classes available scout,warrior,mage and then variants of these) and my experience with a sword and board and staff has both been great. Fighting large enemies is great.I use a PS4 controller.  Pawns - NPC's who join you and stay with you are amazingly done. You are free to choose whomever you like and they not only are excellent in combat but also provide info as you are on quests to help you and also pick up and hold loot for you.The customizability is also impressive in this regard.  I will say story wise initially it is a bit um,dark but it sets the scene well enough.  Overall - a rare gem (at 17 hours , will amend review if needed but at this point an easy recommend).

The story is great, the gameplay is wonderful, with the ability to not only flail at your enemys ankles but also climb up their bodies and... CUTT THEIR ♥♥♥♥ING EYES OUT! It's honestly a great big laugh and deserves alot more recognition for its showman-ship and ability to quite literally have enemys throw your 'pawns' off the edges of cliffs and scream all the way down to the black depths where you inevitably realise you left gear on them that was worth 100+k gold or some ♥♥♥♥ and inevitably say: ♥♥♥♥ me my dragon slaying sword of epic badassness that also lit on fire when enemies were near or when i unsheathed it.. Or you know. AND WITH THE DARK ARISEN DLC AREAS YOU CAN: Fight the grim ♥♥♥♥ing reaper. (He'll rekt u so hard if you don't have death fodder... MAKE SURE YOU STACK UP WAKESTONES BOIS.) Elder ogre's, not to mention Giant room-sized cyclops that have the intimidating name of 'Gorecyclops' who go ape ♥♥♥♥ and smash everything in the room (Including you if you mess up...) as well as giant wolves (Sif is that you?) and then you fight the big fugly thing him self: Daemon or something. I won't lie the armor you get from this area is sooooo bad ♥♥♥ and good that it basically gives you god mode when you T6 all of it. There is room for MAGES, Warriors, Sword and shield nerds, and pokey knives man. and with that. My reveiw ends. So if you like ♥♥♥♥ like skyrim but want actual ♥♥♥♥ing dragons for a change: Play this game, Keep this game, Support the makers and bug the ♥♥♥♥ out of them to make another one so we can play more of this epic ♥♥♥♥, and maybe add a multiplayer system so we have an excuse to stop playing monster hunter and start playing: Dragon's Dogma 2: Fate's Fall or some edgy ♥♥♥♥. Anyways. This game is ♥♥♥♥ing great and gives you free-armor to start off with so play this game and enjoy your selves, have a good ♥♥♥♥in' day guys! Also I'll do reveiws for other games. Just gift them to me. I'll do 3-4 full playthroughs or something and do as many of the side-game stuff as i feel like and then write a reveiw.",
