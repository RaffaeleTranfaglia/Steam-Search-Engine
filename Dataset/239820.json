It incoorporates facts and real events into the game like the release of the PS1, NES, etc. Game Dev's real gem is that it can be played over and over again. The thing about game-Dev is how well it was madeand functions realisticaly (although not everything is realistic in terms of a tychoon game).   Game dev has an overall rating of 9/10 on my list, and I think it would be too on yours. Please buy this game, it will be a good descision.",

The pacing works well and gives you roughly 6-8 hours of play time for the 30 years you get to play. Once you reach the end the game does allow you to keep going, but no more story elements unfold (nothing beyond the PS4 and next Xbox).

The replayability is not great, each game is pretty similar 2. The modding community is a bit scarce 3. The system for rating games is bad. Because you compete against youself, if you make a really good game, all your games after that will get bad ratings unless they are better than your really good game. This is the worst thing about the game because it discourages you from making good games and encourages you to make games that are just a little bit better than your last, whcih isn't fun.  If the devs make a sequel and take the community's advice on board it could be a masterpiece because this is a great concept.  7/10",

At first you start small in your garage, but as you make more and more successful games you can change offices, hire staff, and upgrade your skills through training.   While it is a simple concept, game dev tycoon is promising, in the sense that it keeps adding variety to your game making process and letting you make more complex choices as you progress through the game. The graphics and music are quite simple and not really an asset to be discussed for this game. Its gameplay largely consists of you adjusting sliders so as to decide which concepts you are going to give emphasis on while creating each game, such as sound, graphics etc. You also witness the emergence and disappearance of several types of consoles and decide where to release each game, while also keeping in mind the market trends.   The most prominent problem with this game, would be that you get to decide based on trial and error more often than not, and the feedback you get about the choices you made is not entirely helpful for you to choose better next time around. The existance of a wiki for this game has made it so that tons of people end up following just that, since it is way less frustrating to progress in this way. Overall, I wouldnt call game dev tycoon a bad game, but a game that could use some polishing to shine.  + great genre/topic/platform variety + easy to grasp, hard to master   - game choice feedback is vague",

            "review_text": "As an Indie game, this is not bad.   I'm a fan of the original Tycoon games, so it's safe for me to say that this Indie game made it pretty far. If you think about it, it's not about the graphics or music - it's about the strategy and the satisfaction you get from that successful achievement of being, well, successful. This is one feeling we all have deep down inside and it can come from anywhere, real life scenarios, or video games.   Rather you're fishing and finally got a hook, or moving to the next stage in this game it's the same feeling of accomplishment. The only thing the game lacks is maybe a higher time frame between console releases. It seems to be a little too fast-paced when you're actually sitting here playing it. This game could also use a meter on how fast you'd like time to pass rather it's real-time or 100x faster for example.  Pros: -Addictive gameplay -Allows your creativity to fly -Good engine -Basic controls (Rather you're a gaming veteran or a newcomer, anyone can play with ease)  Cons: -No control on the time flow  -You'll mostly always feel rushed -Could use some more tweaking  Overall, I'd give this a 8/10. I can tell this took some time to actually develop - as I said before it's not about the graphics or music that made this the game it is today, it's the gameplay. From what I can tell, it took awhile to actually make this game fully functional which needs to be credited. This could be a text-based game and I'd still enjoy it.  Would I recommend it? Maybe, I wouldn't say $10 USD would be worth Game Dev Tycoon, however I'd say around the $4.99 or lower range (on sale) would be reasonable. Some have regrets about buying this game, you need to give it time or maybe start over. The point is, have fun.",

Graphics and sound are quirky (in a good way), the interface in unintrusive and functions rather smoothly, and gameplay is entertaining. My major criticism would be a lack of replay value; after you've successfully completed a 35-year 'career,' I'm not sure there's much reason to return for a second pass at the game.  Nevertheless, that first trip through the game consumes a solid five or six hours of gameplay -- during which I never found myself bored.

This game is addictive as f**k. Starting from a guy in a shed in the early 1980s and watching the company of your own name (in my case, NotEACorp) growing into a company releasing games about ninja princesses and getting punched in the balls by critics is wholly satisfying, except for when a critic pans your game, which only makes you want to make a better game to impress him/her/it, thus contributing to the addiction.  My only complaint about this game is that, for a game made up of a load of 2D sprites, the randomly appearing framerate drops, while suprising, are more annoying than anything. I understand that indie games aren't the best optimised games on the market, but this is giving me horrifying nighmares about GTA 4 all over again.

The mechanics are simple and easy to understand, allowing you to get right to the important business of building and customizing your games. And when you finally get that first 10 rating, and that first million bucks, everything has been worth it. Greatly looking forward to sequels/updates/mods/finishing the game.  -----  This is five weeks and 40 hours of additional gameplay after that first paragraph. I still recommend this game, but with a lot less enthusiasm. The game gets very repetitive after a while, especially because financial success hinges on putting out one near-perfect game every few years or so, with everything else just being filler. I absolutely hope there's a bigger badder sequel in a year or two, one that addresses the following issues:  Idiot Publishers: Your mid-game is overly dependent on using publishers so you can make larger games for more money and fans. But more often than not the publisher will either ask for a game you haven't researched, a format you don't have rights to, or a terrible topic/genre combo. I get that it's supposed to make you take chances and expand your options, but if I'm desperate and need a medium game fast, I'd like to actually be able to make one. Employee Stagnation: In order for their skills to improve, your employees must train. Making games gives them nothing; you MUST spend time and research points and capitol on boosting their skills. And you have to do this a lot, which means that you can't be constantly working on games - or researching new topics/engine elements. Chronic Indie Mindset: Even once you hit the late game and become an industry juggernaut, it's still just seven dudes cranking out a game. Yes, you can eventually develop a hardware lab and an R&amp;D department, but they don't directly assist in game-making. I want to become a monster, with dozens - or even hundreds - of employees, making multiple games at once, training some people while others are dedicated to improving my engine and so on. Research Bottleneck: As mentioned above, you need research points to train employees as well as to research new topics and game engine elements. The only way to generate RP for most of the game is to make more games, a newer engine, or generate a game report. As such, you often end up falling behind in either training or engine (or god forbid, both) as you struggle to devote enough points to their multiple needs. I'd recommend being able to create an R&amp;D lab much sooner, thus giving the player many more points to work with, rather than reducing point requirements. Hardware Focused: When I first started playing, I really loved how the game told the history of gaming consoles, as it's not something you hear about a lot when researching gaming history. But consoles are almost exclusively the only outside influence on your game-making. Nothing about software or legal battles or any of that. Just console development. And while interesting, it's such a small part of the story. Forced Conformity: One of this game's mechanics has you matching game topics to genres; the better the match, the better it sells. In other words, you can't make a unique game. For example, according to GDT, Prison/RPG is an okay combination. But what if I want to make a stellar Prison/RPG? Instead of just stating that such-and-such a combination is good or bad, it should be up to the player to make it good or bad. Also, the entire nation of Japan would like to say something about Romance/RPG not being a great combination; I have 60 hours of gameplay and that still messes me up.  And yet despite all those flaws, it's still an enjoyable game. In my last playthrough I jokingly made a Vampire RPG called Count of Calypso and it got me out of the basement. The three sequels got me into the final game stage, paid for my R&amp;D lab and new game engine, and became the game I was known for, respectively. I created the Fallout franchise with the help of Dave Johnson, head of Departure Science. Tom Schoffer is somehow a tech genius and became my first AI specialist. I made Half-Life, Half-Life 2, and won the game before I could releas Half-Life 3. There are so many good stories that come out of Game Dev Tycoon; I just wish it were less frustrating to create them.",

            "review_text": "The story of the game is that you go back to the year 1985 and start your own game company. You start off in a garage which you can upgrade to a technical suite and more! As time progresses there are news popups which describe events that are taking place in the gaming industry at the time. For example: Vonny has just released their second video game system. Some games you make may be a smash hit but others not so great, you must be wise with the topic, genre and console. You can earn millions or become bankrupt. To improve the chance of making a great game is to hire staff which becomes available in the upgraded garage (becomes the technical suite). The staff can be used to help make games, research topics and research different features of the engine.   When you start off, the game may be a bit tricky but once you learn which topic matches with which genre it will seem easier. With the ability to make games there is a cost. At the start of each career you recieve a certain budget which you can use to develop your first game! It randomly selects the first topics you can use so don't excpect to get the one you want. During making games with the budget you can go bankrupt, although it seems bad you can get two chances before you finally go bankrupt and have to start over.  Overall Rating: 9/10 (Highly Recommended)  I rate this game a 9 out of 10 because of how addicting it is, the details of the game and the dream of any gamer to make their own game company. Green Heart Games need to make a few tweaks which are only little ones. For example when the reviews of the games you make pop up it takes 20 seconds to display all of them. I feel that this wastes time but you can download a mod off of the workshop to reduce it to 1 second but hopefully they will change it anyway :).  Thanks for reading this review and good luck with your game company :)  Daniel",

            "review_text": "Game Dev Tycoon is a strategy game developed by Greenheart games. You begin the game by naming your character with limited customization and naming your company, then with a very helpful tutorial system, you're off to create games as you see fit.  When you start, the only thing you can do is create a game, you can make it text based or 2-D gameplay, but as you progress through the years you will be able to research new things such as the ability to make a 3-D engine, better A.I., environmental effects, all that stuff. To get these research ideas, you must get research points by making a game, engine, or doing something like creating a report on what you did wrong when developing your game.   When you begin making your game, you can choose the genre, which topic it will be based on (Ancient history, ninjas, spies) and choosing which systems it will be on You can also create your own engine with many of these research skills, which can cost quite a lot sum of dosh. When developing your game, you have to use 3 sliders to see how much time you want to spend on a part of a game, for example, do you focus on the story more than the game or vice versa? Graphics or sound, A.I. or Dialogue? As you develop your game, Journalists will ask for interviews and ask on you're opinion on things such as what's important in a genre of a game, you can also hype up the game by saying stuff like '*Name* will be one of the greatest', you can also sign missions such as a plan to get women into gaming which will cost you, but earn you a lot of fans and respect. Once you've created your game, you will gain experience in pretty much all your skills such as your story writing, gameplay designing, sound and graphics, etc. The game will also then be reviewed by 4 reviewers, you may start by getting 5s, 4s, and probably 2s, but once you've managed to get your first 10 out of 10, you will want to raise your hand in success.  If you've done badly, you can generate a game report which can give you advise, such as the Commodore 64 has a large adventure fanbase, or the PC community has a large strategy fanbase, and whether things such as dialogue is important for certain genres. However, if you still manage to do badly, you will enter bankrupcy and will have to take a loan from the bank, fail that, game over.  As you earn more money, you can move into bigger offices where you can recruit more staff members as well as make the place look very pretty. As you make good games you will gain fans, who will definatly buy your games and if you got 100K of them, you'll be able to self publish your games, you can also sign publish contracts with companies such as úbersoft or Electronic Mass Productions to gain notice in the industry, but they'll call the shots on what you make. Later in the game you can also build your custom console to release onto the market. I gotta say, the gameplay is pretty damn addicting, so much so I've been spending 6 hours into a single play session which I never really do a lot, and that says something for me.  Nothing to say in the visual department, it looks clean and reminds me of a few flash games.  The sound is pretty good too, nice beeps and bloops and the music keeps a smile on my face 99% of the time.  As far as complaints go.....well, there isn't any on the top of my head to be honest, I was too occupied in making games and having too much fun to notice any.  Overall, Game Dev Tycoon is a brilliant game and you should absolutly purchase it as soon as you can.  I'd play it for decades.  9/10",

If you are excited by the idea of owning your own game developing business, this game will hold intrinsic delight for you. That was the case with me, so natuarally I liked this game.  Especially at first, it's fun creating the games. Basically, after you decide to make a video game, you allot portions of time to specific development aspects like graphics, sound, world design, etc. You do so by sliding a meter up or down depending on how much time you want to spend on that aspect of design. You must use wisdom, because certain game genres and topics will turn out better or worse depending on how much time you spend on a certain aspect of design. At first the gameplay was exciting for me. It's enjoyable to see the monetary effects of your good game design ;) . But for the most part, you as the player as repeating the same processes for designing each game. It's not a thoughtless procedure (because you have to figure out what to spend time on in development, pick a topic, etc) but you're pretty much following the same game mechanic(s) over and over to make each game.  As times goes on, you can market your game, research new topics, train and hire employees, put up a booth at the National game convention, take publishing deals, etc. Though these are varying ideas, you pretty much get the same 'feel' when you're playing. It's point and click stuff, which is normal for a tycoon like this I suppose. For me personally, the game began to bore me a couple of hours into the gameplay, but I allowed myself to enjoy it and had fun making profit. What will keep you coming back is the steady introduction of new consoles and features. Just when you think you've seen all the game features, a new one may come up, like being able to use a Research and Development team to undergo projects.  The bottom line is that the feel of the game mechanics feels somewhat repititive and will likely bore you UNLESS you like the idea of being a big-time game dev. If that's you, then that idea which stands behind this game--and the desire to succeed--will be an incentive to play for some time. It wasn't an entirely enthralling experience, but I liked it.",

Gamplay is solid, with some minor issues. The game roughly separates in three phases: Garage, small time developer and AAA-Studio.  The first phase is easy and was my personal favourite: You just make games you like and combine new ideas, without any boring micro management.  The second phase steps up the difficulty a notch: You move into a studio and hire staff to make even bigger games. Suddendly you have to maage much more stuff and cash becomes a serious issue. Do you burn money on a new game-engine or concentrate on churning out games.  The third and final stage is a bit easier in my opinion: You hire more guys and concentrate on AAA-Titels, enlarge your studio and develop stuff like steam, you own consol and convention and so on...  My complaints are that after the time seems to 'fly by' at phase 2 and 3. Consols come and go and you almost have no chance to develop anything for them so you stay at one system you know well (the PC) and stick with it.  You have to train your avatar and staff using reseach points, which are not to easy to get in abundance. When you have enough research points and a trained staff at the final phase the game is almost over.  Some of the user interface is also no designed perfectly, but that may be my personal taste.  All in all a fun little experience with potential.",

All in all 9/10 Perfect bargain, well worth the price  Side note-I believe the addition of being able to sign with a company and make exclusives would enhance the already great depth of this game also to be able to bankrupt other companies and take them over. Competing would be nice as well with a rivial(Dice v.s Whoever is making the years installment of COD). Also id like to see more depth, an example could be instead of just a sport game you could list a specific sport like football. Instead of just military how about sub catagories like ww2 and stuff.",

            "review_text": "preface: In this review, keep in mind that I am following release dates to the US-only releases of products. I am not going to include EU or JP release dates due to this games setting being in the US. With that out of the way, let's get on with the review. - Game Dev Tycoon is a indipendence medium-game developed by Greenheart Games. And let me tell you: It's fun and addictive.  Game Dev Tycoon is about ''You'' being a video/PC-Game devloper in the post-1983 crash/Atari Shock and working your way up top all the way up to the year ...2018? I think. - [Let's talk about the story] The story isn't mush to talk about.  It begins with the post-'83 crash were computer-games survived the disaster, Nintendo reviving consoles in late-1985, Sega releasing GENESIS in 1989, SONY releases PS1 in late-1995 and so on.  The story is abridged though, so some events have been cut-out... such as Apple in the 80/90s, Linux, SEGA Saturn, all the add-ons for the GENESIS and *Panasonics 3DO  *Though the 3DO didn't do well in US and EU and is nothing in comparison to GENESIS and SNES, it deserves recognition in gaming history for selling well in Japan. - [Let's talk about the gameplay] When developing a game, you are presented with three development stages and three pillars for each development stage(total of nine pillars).  You adjust the pillars to what works and what doesn't work. Whether you want to focus a lot on gameplay or focus a little on A.I. or don't focus on the story etc.  After all the three development stages are done, you then wait for reviews.  If you get very bad reviews, then that's going to give you negative fans and make less money depending on the reviews and if you hyped the game before release.  If you get great reviews, then you are going to make a lot of money and have a huge following. journalists and critics will mention your great feat and with recognition you will get offers from different people.  Game dev Tycoon has a... sort of.. roguelike feel to it. If you mess up in the beginning and make a wrong decision then you could get a game-over.  If you make 1M dollars, you then move to an office and hire more staff and make bigger games.  Though I think this is a great gameplay mechanic, I still think there are a couple of ''missed opportunities'' in the gameplay that could have been in the game. Such as:  -You can't make a launch title. Or/and getting an offer from SONY or Nintendo for an exclusive title. -You can't put a price on a game.  -Why can't you make something viral? like spreading a rumour of a hidden room or a mythical creature or something, like GTA with big foot. Or Mortal Kombat with the blood code on SNES. -Why can't you make 2 games at the same time. one small game an a large game for example. -Why can't you make an expansion pack on a normal game? You can make an Exp. pack, but only on MMOs. -Why can't my character have a background? not all companies starter out as one guy like Bungie. Some starter out as three guys such as Blizzard. ...and so on. I have a mush bigger list in my head of ''missed opportunities'' with GDT. These are a few example. - [Let's talk about the Graphics] Game Dev Tycoons graphics is hand drawn animation. I like Game Dev. Tycoons graphics. - [Let's talk about the music] For a simulator that's all about developing games, the music in this game isn't really that important. Game Dev Tycoons music is relaxing and kind to your ears. - [Before I give my ''Final Score'', I would like to say something] GDT opened up my point of view of how it looks like when developing a game. Before I played GDT I thought ''Ok... developers keep saying in interviews that the reason they can't make a sequel is because it's NOT that easy'' and I am all like ''well... maybe they're just saying that because they just want to make money and don't really care about the fans''. And after I played GDT, I finally understood what developers were saying about ''It's NOT that easy''. - [Final Score] GDT is a great game... but I feel like there were a lot of missed oppertunities. But it can be forgiven because of the addicive gameplay and for being an indie-game. I didn't like that the story was abridged and your main-character was ''another avarage Joe''. That's why I give GDT a ''great'' 8.5/10 and a ''recommended'' for anybody.  I can reccommend game dev. Tycoon to anybody, even casuals. Even If you're not familiar with Simulations. And also, if you have the motivation to learn and such, then GDT is for you.  [Here is an idea I have for ''Greenheart Games'' if they ever make a sequel] If Greenheart Games ever make a sequel to GDT or an Exp. Pack. Then I am would like them to add those ''missed opportunities'' that I talked about in the ''gameplay''-section.  I would also like the sequel/exp. pack to follow the gaming history more accurately. - ...And that's my review of GDT. Peace out and have a good one.",

After the games 35 year end point you can continue playing, unlocking things and perfecting your games but after that it gets boring after 40-50yrs depending on how well you're doing.  It took me roughly 3 days to level up my character and employees to level 10, unlock everything and get all the achievements. It was fun and enjoyable but after the 20 hour mark it did get a bit boring and repetitive but the game is moddable and people have expanded upon and improved the game which is great for another couple of hours.

Reviews need more feedback, only sometimes will a magazine article pop up telling you why the game flopped. When you make a game and focus the work in the correct areas, nail the target demographic and genre combinations, and do everything right and it still completely bombs, it would be nice to know what factors are affecting that. (Obsolete engine tech? Random chance? What?) as 'game reports' only give info on the things you already knew were correct. The info displayed in those magazine articles, should be in the reviews.  This concept however needs to be taken further.  Exclusivity Contracts: Theres needs to be more risk involved in the success of consoles, like having a manufacturer pay you a ton of money, but limiting you to their consoles for a duration of time.  Random Mode: A mode where the success of different platforms is randomized, and doesnt follow historic numbers. This would make the Exclusivity contracts more risky, as suddenly your Playstation contract screws you over, when the Philips CD-I dominates the market.  More consoles: CD-I, Neo Geo Arcade Cabinets, Jaguar, Ouya, Virtual Boy, Gameboy Color, GBA, etc. lets get them all in here.",

Ultimately, while you are given many genres/topics/platforms to use to make your games, Game Dev Tycoon always follows the same path of progression. Once you figure out how to consistently release high scoring games you will be able to make money consistently and gain lots of fans. Since most of the gaming devices are inspired by real world events, if you know anything about gaming history its not hard to figure out the 'right' choices. There are some random events to change things up, but I find they are few and far between. It would be nice if the market would be more dynamic rather than follow static events, kind of like being able to play 'what if?' in gaming history. i.e. What if the Dreamcast had a major title that drove up console sales? Would that cause Microsoft to stay out of the market instead of trying to challenge Sony? What if the game with the most hype was really bad and led to less sales for the PS2? You do get to enter the console market with your own device, but this is so late into the game that it doesn't really mean much. Other suggestions, it would be nice if there was more to the game when it comes to sales and profit. Whether you self publish, or work with a publisher the amount of money you make seems to be only determined by the review score. You can take advantage of randomly generated trends in the market to boost sales, but if you make a good game it sells well regardless. It would be interesting to have random events in the market that can negatively affect the sales of high scoring games. Finally, the managing of employees could be more interesting. Maybe have them leave to form new studios, demand a raise, retire, happiness rating, etc. This would provide nice challenges to managing your studio besides training/replacing/send on vacation. Overall, I enjoy this game very much, but would like to see more depth to the gameplay to make the game more dynamic.",

            "review_text": "Cute little game, with one big, glaring flaw.  The gist of the gameplay is this: You have a game studio (initially in your garage) after having time-traveled back to the dawn of videogames(Apparently via Delorean). Your task is to make games, selecting genre, topic, platform, and later on audience and different game features to include. Each time you make a game, it gets a review score and is then put on sale for a period of time (no re-issues or long term issues, you get that one period and then never make a dime off that game again.)  During development, you choose different areas to allocate dev time to, like gameplay, world design, story, and artifical intelligence. Different genres emphasize different areas, and if you don't allocate your time accordingly the game quality suffers. The quality itself is measured in two areas: Design and Technology. As you develop the game, your developers add design and technology points to the game. The game tracks your record score in each area and tells you if you've beat it.  The values you need to use for each slider for each genre you can learn and save for future playthroughs, as well as which age groups prefer which topics, which topics work well with each genre and which don't, which genres work on which platforms, and which age groups use which platforms.  The flaw comes in with the bits you CAN'T learn from the game itself (In fact, people have had to source-dive to find bits of it), and how those bits are used.  Each genre has a Target Technology:Design ratio, the existence of which is hinted at nowhere in the game, which you get penalized for badly missing and a bonus for hitting come review time. Additionally, the generation of points for each is determined by a mix of your developers' stats and what area is being worked on, which makes sense, but again isn't indicated. Furthermore, the types of points produced by different focus areas needed for a particular genre don't always match up with the Tech:Design ratio that genre needs.  Strategy Games are probably the worst example of this, with a target ratio is 1.4 (7 points of Tech for every 5 points of design.) The three major Focus areas for a Strategy game are Gameplay (Produces 80% Design, 20% tech), Level Design (40% Design, 60% Tech), and World Design (60% Design, 40% Tech), with minor focus areas in Engine (20% Design 80% tech), AI (20% Design, 80% Tech), and Sound (60% Design, 40% Tech).  Which means that if you allocate time going off the focus areas with a balanced Dev Team, you'll end up slightly Design heavy, rather than fairly tech heavy as you're supposed to. And if you don't allocate based on the focus areas, you get penalized for that too.  So in order to make a really good strategy game, you need to be able to unbalance the points via other methods to make it favor tech despite the slight design emphasis built in to it. There's no indication anywhere of the game of any of that, except for the mediocre reviews you get despite having set new records for quality.  The other thing which isn't indicated is that the reviews set a target for your games based on your best previous games. It's realistic and not surprising, but also not indicated at all.  The combined effect is that to consistentently do well you have to do things that are unintuitive and that the game doesn't point you towards. If you try to generalize and swap back and forth between tech and design games, you'll end up only beating your record on one score at a time. And get penalized for it. Plus for not hitting the ratios. So you need to deliberately unbalance your dev team to favor either tech or design, and then stick with the genres that require whichever you're focusing on.   Thankfully, you can find out which those are from the wiki, as a result of helpful people source-diving, because it's sure not available in game.  Overall it's cute, silly, and fun, but the lack of indication of these very important mechanics can make it a bit frustrating (at least until you hit the wiki.)",

Players are tasked with starting a game development company and controlling the development and release of games as the years pass. New technology is introduced as time passes, which can play a role in how you wish to develop your games and company. The game is scripted to have release events of real consoles (named slightly differently for copyright reasons I am guessing). The release of these consoles is actually quite comical- you'd just have to play to see what I mean.  Games can be named, sequels can be made to games. Research can be done to unlock tech, employees can be selected and hired and trained and their roles can be specialized so that areas such as 'World Design' or 'Artificial Intelligence' can be professionally implemented in your games. You can control which employee works on which part of the game and how much time they have to spend.. different types of games will favor you spending more time in different areas. For example, RPG games will require you to allot more time in World Design and Story/Quests.   Overall, the design mechanics are a bit repetitive, but if you wish to have a lot of variety you can choose to develop different kinds of games. I was continually pleasantly surprised at how much detail was in the game and how much you could actually control and do. You can eventually create your own console, MMO's and even expansion packs.   The economy of the game is forgiving enough for new players, but in order to succeed to a high degree you would need to think carefully about what you are doing.  The first night I played, I played almost all night and managed to basically finish the main story line. That being said, I felt like there was a choice of pathways. I could go back to this game and not feel as though it was the exact same experience. Is there unlimited replayability? The short answer is no, but if you have a good imaginination, you could have fun almost every time you decide to play.   ",

Firstly, this game is amazing because: You can mae your own games, your own consoles, complete contracts, work with publishers, make genre/topic combinations, and more. You can also make a Military/Action game, call it Call of Duty with medium graphics and give it to young audiences. Oh well, enough with trash-talking let's go to the real pros/cons PROS; -Music, It's random and suits the game. Calm. 9.5/10 -Graphics. They're not super next gen graphics, but simple that don't demand beefy computers. 9.5/10 -Art: Console art, or anything here, that's one of the best in the game. 10/10 -Story: Every console has been renamed, for example, Playstation is now Playsystem. The story is well fitting, amazing, and it can reach up to Playsystem 5, and Mbox Next, which have amazing Art. 10/10 -Mods: The community is making some amazing mods, to simple topic or researches mods, to mods that overhaul the game. I can say, this feature is really good, since it won't make you be bored of that game. The game Runs in JavaScript and CSS. I'm a modder myself as well. The new update will introduce workshop Support, which is making this feature much more amazing. There's even a MultiplayerMod. 10/10  CONS; - Playtime is around 6-8 hours in 30 years, and 10-12 in 42 years, the game ends too quick. - There won't be any more content updates, because the developers left that feature to modders.  Conclusion: I don't think that the Cons here win. I find the Pros really good so that's why I bought this game. I'm often in the forums, which are almost dead, but we hope after the 1.5.0 update, people may come over to the forums. There are quite good impressive mods in the forums if you want to check them out. Just Google greenheartgames forums.",

Not sure which one came out first so I'm not implying anything just that if you enjoy Kairosoft's GDS this is an absolute grab. If you've never played GDS read on.  This is a game in which you start off as a programmer in your basement trying to put out a few games for the PC. Starting off you have a very limited selection of genres you can make and platforms you can put games out on. Over time you'll be able to expand your knowledge-base of genres and be able to put out games on multiple platforms. As you progress throughout the game you will also find yourself moving out of your basement and into proper offices and bring in NPCs to help you and feel like an actual company. You can research new genres, purchase contracts with new gaming systems, perform contract work on the side and even design your own console late in the game. You can train your employees and yourself to put a little more stats in those weak areas and pump out better games.   This game has a lot of possibilities and the replayability is seemingly endless with your playthrough being dependent on the sales of your games which is not the same each time through. I love the fact that the game pays homage to all of the consoles that have been on the market with such names as TES, Gameling, Playsystem, Dreamvast, Mbox, and more.

But just sart over and try again, the starting topics are random and you can choose to carry over the knowledge you leanred about each topic and genre from previous trys. Build your games off of what you know of trendy video games and you'll make the money you need to start playing around and getting creative with your game designs and taking chances. Messing up when you're working out of your garage by yourself but once you get into your second and third design studio making a bad game or two won't leave you in the red.

I was excited to play this game for a long time until I finally got it before it was even on Steam. I was instantly in love with the game. Between Steam and the original I probably have 100+ hours. I just find it so fun to make games and it is so suspencful to finally see the review scores. Overall, I believe this is a must-buy game for anyone who is a fan of tycoon games. Also, since they added mod support the game has gotten even better with a couple mods already coming out. My score is a 9.5/10. One of my favorite games of all time.",

Earn insane sales records by mixing genres and gameplay to their most suitable platform. By the end of it you're a multi-genre/multi platform giant!

From there on out you have to use your limited budget to try and develop games, grow your fanbase, and hopefully move your company out of your parents garage.  The gameplay is rather simple and user-friendly which is fantastic for the beginning player but can get a tad tedious once you're on your 7th or 8th run through of the game, that's not to say it makes the game less enjoyable but it would have definitely been a plus if the game let you get a little more hands-on at points. As the game progresses you get to choose which consoles you want to purchase a developing license for, as well as create new game engines as new technology becomes available to you. Careful portioning of your budget is vital to gameplay and a rash spender will soon find themselves bankrupt and bought out.

It gives you a general feel of how the game industry has evolved throughout the years, parodying famous events, and has really immersive gameplay combined with that 'one more turn' feel from titles like Civilization V. I'd recommend it to anybody who likes, well, having fun.  Game Dev Tycoon sets you off in your own measly garage, making a 2D game. But as you make more and more games, you witness the world around you change: gaming becomes more popular, companies arise, and it becomes the next trend. The game portrays this transformation amazingly: you get to experience firsthand how the gaming industry morphed small developers into the giants of gaming today. Along this path, you manage your own gaming company, churning out titles that decide your company's fate, and, the gaming world's fate.  The gameplay in Game Dev is deceptively simple. You create games, with certain genres, and you allocate how much time each specific part needs (such as Level Design, or Engine). Over time, you learn what combinations create your AAA games, and what can give you the most money. Along the way, you add more features: Character Progression, Loading Screens, etc. Eventually, you'll be able to make giant projects, and more! Throughout this entire time, you also manage your staff, control marketing, and PR. It gives a very immersive experience in the simulation genre.  Furthermore, the game provides lots of replayability. Every new game start provides different scenarios, and you can tell the game to veer off course of what happened in reality. The Steam Workshop community provides even more: hundreds of mods for the game can change your experience, whether it be the addition of 'Next-Gen Consoles', or the pcmasterrace. The game goes way beyond the initial purchase, giving you endless opportunities.  Game Dev Tycoon may not be a AAA title, but it's definitely worth its price, and more. It features very immersive gameplay and storytelling, a fabulous community, and an overall well-designed game. Kudos to Greenheart Games for making one of my favourite simulation games of all time!",

This is accomplished by fighting legal incidents, attending to fans and managing projects. Even though this game does a lot of things right it also does quite a few things wrong aswell like not enough research and topics and some sort of online mode is missing here. These aside the game provides hours of time sunk into this game and is worth its price tag. Highly recommended unless you have a game like mad games tycoon. I rate this game a 7/10.",

I simply cannot fathom how doing something better than it was can make a game worse. -More research points; research points are worth more than gold in this game, you simply cannot have enough of them.

Now, this is a small problem, but I think in the future they should add a setting where you can continue your company even after the 30 years. This would be great because it would offer more things to the game like more platforms like the Play System 4, or even fictional platforms would be great. I could imagine an iPhone 8 being the size of an iPad. Oh, and I forgot, I hate the idea that you have different platforms to choose from. It's like, I'm making a strategy game, and PC is the best at strategy games, so whats the point? I guess it's that you get more interest, but that really didn't affect my games when I made a game for the PC and the Playsystem 3.

I mean you don't want to beat a game in 2 minutes, games are suppose to give you a thrill and leave a lasting effect on you.

Unfortunately, I had to raise my hand and fire my talented employees that had been around for a long time and loved the company. Hired a wave of new guys.  Ended up losing a lot of fans after my games became abyssal. I guess the team of people I hired that were not specialized and straight with little experience were not good enough for what I wanted them to develop. I'm glad that the games I wanted to develop were really good ideas, or so I thought, so it definitely wasn't my idea! It isn't my fault that my buggy rehashes that lacked design wouldn't sell.

You can easily hop in and out of it, and entire games don't take more than an hour or so.  Problems:  1. It runs *way* slower than it should, given how simplistic the assets are. Pretty horribly optimized.  2. Annoying menus that constantly pop up in a 'news feed' sort of fashion. They should be on the side of the screen and not stop/effect your game play. This is the single biggest reason I don't play this game any more. It becomes more and more tedious with time.  Those shortcomings aside, I'd still happily buy it for that amount.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

A little is cleaned up by generating game reports, but still, a lot is untouched that could be fixed by slightly more exstensive reviews. Same goes for positive reviews. Did you do good because it's a sequel on a new engine, or because you simply moved the sliders a bit more accuratley?  Oh yeah, and if you miss a game because of an outdated engine, you're pretty much screwed.  Overall, Game Dev Tycoon, while feedback could be touched up, is a fun, challenging game.

Other improvements include the ability to create MMOs, multigenre and multiplatform games, as well as a compelling soundtrack. By no means a perfect game, it's definitely worth its price and a solid entry in the business simulation genre.

A lot of the procedures in the game (how it ranks the games you make, how well they do in the market, etc) were somewhat easy to follow. Luckily hidden enough so I couldnt tell exactly what to do to get exactly what I wanted, it still seems pretty simple.  Pros: 1. Addictive. Remeber that old Lemonaid Stand game everyone used to love? It's kinda like that, but x10. I was glued to my chair for the entirety of the day. 2. Replay Value. Maybe not for me personally, but there is a lot of potential in this game. It can go far, and you can log a lot of well entertained hours for a fairly cheap price. 3. Design. The music may be awful, but the visuals are appealing to say the least, and it has some clever values to it that I really enjoyed seeing in a game.  Overall I truly enjoyed this game. Whenever it showed a hint of getting monotonous or boring in any way, it threw a curve ball and had you working over here on something entirely different. It keeps you entertained all the way to the end, as short as it may be. However it did feel a little incomplete, and could use a couple patches.  Even with all that being said, and being (in my opinion) a tough judge, I have to give it at least an 8/10. It could use some updates for small annoying things here and there, and it was pretty short, but overall a fantastic game.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game on sale expecting a nice casual timewaster and I got that from it and more.  The gameplay starts off enjoyable, accessable and creative and gradually builds in complexity as you learn the ropes and unlock features. The late game is packed with features that will keep you entertained until the end. It's addictive gameplay and keeps you coming back for more.  As for drawbacks, I'm not sure the replayability is very strong. After playing a few successful games, you kind of feel like there is little deviation from the script. Sure, the topics available to you at the start are random every time and there are a couple of different ways to specialize your company but by the middle to late game, you're following the same sort of pattern as many other times before.  The time speed is set well at the start of the game but soon becomes a little too fast, not giving you enough time to appreciate the gameplay but forcing you to work quickly to keep up. This can be fun but I feel that in the later stages you should have time to consider your options more without having to pause the game. Often the R&amp;D office is rushed and seems like a last minute part of the game rather than an integral feature. A player-adjustable time speed would be great for this.  The story progression is good, but it would be nice for your company to have some small impact on the way the market plays out. It can feel as though you're stuck in a bubble, with no visible competition from other companies and no impact of your company on the wider world. Competing companies and an interactive market would be great in this game, perhaps with different regions responding differently to your games.  The linear progression from office to office can harm replayability. Being able to choose different offices with different pro's and con's would make the game much more replayable and introducing choosable upgrades, even cosmetic ones, for your office would be great. I was really hoping I could spend the money I made to upgrade the car in the garage!  Overall this is a fantastic little game, with heaps of potential. It's addictive, full of features and enjoyable. I really really hope that the developers will expand on this and introduce some diversity and branching choices to make it more replayable.",

            "review_text": "Game Dev Tycoon is, much like it sounds, a simulation game about running your own game development company. You start off as a singular developer with your sparce savings working in your garage, eventually making enought money to hire on a few employees of your own, then moving into bigger offices with bigger companies and eventually even to making your own consoles. You can develop games for all the major consoles through the years, outfitting them with the latest innovations (if you can afford it!) and trying to build a gaming company that will last through the ages.   Most of the game is focused on developing games, and rightfully so. The development is less abstract creativity and more focused on allocating points properly; should you put more effort into dialogues or enemy AI for your adventure game? Do you have enough resources to develop both an AI companion and moral choices, or will budget and time contraints force you to cut one? The games are still abstract enough that they provide plenty of room for the player to fill in the gaps, however. You can create a studio known for groundbreaking horror adventures in one game and devote another to sprawling sci-fi shoot-em-ups. The various topics that are accessable without extensive research change each game, further encouraging players to play each studio differently and explore new genre and topic combinations.  Good as it is, I do wish the game had some sort of free play mode where you could just play around with developing games in a particular genre, or at least the ability to pick when in the storyline you wish to start. Reviewers tend to pan any games smaller in scope than your last ones, so mobile market? Forget it! By the time mobile games come along, a moderately successful developer won't even be able to break into the market, since all your games will have been larger scale endevors. I'd love to be able to play as a small developer trying to break into the indie market, or an upstart mobile dev that eventually makes the big time.  Overall, I recommend this game to fans of simulation titles. Whlie it has a few flaws and the rating system can force players to contantly be building bigger, it's become a solid game with a great deal of depth.",

The people who pirated the game then went to the forums to do exactly what real world game developers did: Ask how the heck they could make a profit with that piracy in place, if they could add DRM, or take other measures to fight it because they couldn't keep their business going.  If an entertainment product manages to relay a message into the real world with such power that people emulate its behavior, it's a work of art in my book. Fight club did it before by making people emulate the 'You do not talk about fight club' slogan (because it would ruin the unique plot twists). This game did it through its remarkable method of making a statement about software piracy.   This game is a work of art. It deserves to be tried just for that.",

I found it to be like a mmo game in the aspect that once you reach the max level and unlock all the features it's boring and you have nothing left to do but sit and get richer.  If I could figure out how to use the mod creator or create a mod myself I would deffinatly make a new office level. The level would be a sky scraper or tower with different floors, perhaps the first floor would be a shop that you could sell your games and customize/decorate it with items made by your company or decorations bought from in game shops. Maybe seperate the R&amp;D lab into a floor and the research lab. Then make a floor dedicated to your empolyees with a lounge and work area with a few more desks than last time. Then perhaps a personal office for yourself. It would also be nice to have a virtual reallity or full emersion mod added to the game. I also feel like an event mod is needed to add a more emersive feel to the game. Such events as the one where when you come out with your first consul if it does well, when other competetors announce their new consuls a event message pops up saying let us see how it fairs against 'players consul'. I would love if they simply added more event messages like this so I would feel more involved in my gaming industry world.  But in the end I feel like rather than another mod fthis game could use an 'expansion pack' tat would add these things in, but sadly I'm afraid greenheartsgaming is not the kind of group that would do this kind of thing. For an example they went as far as to TROLL, yes TROLL, piraters who have no money with a fake game that would make it impossibly to beat as the game went on. Sadly this TROLL failed as a full pirated version did become available on the interenet but with no steam access.  I do look foward to games from this company but I don't hold my expectations high.

In fact, it looks like a browser based Flash game from 10 years ago. 2) It's frustratingly random sometimes. 3) The stock game is quite limited, and you have to wait for the game itself to allow you to innovate through Research.  But forget all that. This game is, above all else, FUN. It's an enormous waste of time that sucks you in and doesn't spit you out for another six hours or so without even realising. And isn't that what games are all about? There is something enormously addictive &amp; satisfying watching those little coloured balls 'schlup' into their respective bases.  I was involved in game development in the mid-80s (budget games on the C64), which is more or less where this game starts out, and whilst it doesn't claim to be a historical document or anything so grandiose as that, the way the game pans out is strikingly familiar to anyone of a certain age who was there.  The feeling you get when you strike upon a winning formula, the temptation to blow your windfall on that 'personal' game you've always wanted to write (only for it to flop dramatically thanks to some heartless reviews), whether to start the game slow'n'steady or go all out for that big hit. The decisions you make in this game are not always provided by the game itself, and that's what is so compelling about it. It's a lovely throwback to a time when games were as much about your own imagination as what is presented on screen.  In short, I love this game. It's a perfect example of what an 'indie' game should be, and my only hope is that the developers have successfully managed to research 'Sequels' and are busy working on one right now. If they are, one thing I would like to see is modular development - so you can add a couple of features to a game engine without having to invest the time &amp; money re-writing everything from scratch.

My first run through the game, I was feeling great. By around year 20 I just expanded my R&amp;D division. My main game, Call of Doody (Mature Military Action) was making hit after hit. Cross Country Canada (Transport Sim) was in it's 5th installment with Hacky Sack (Sports sim) performing well along with a handful of other titles.   I made a critial mistake at this point and failed to keep up with the technology. I spent too much time training my employees to expand the business and sunk too much money into reseach on technologies. My game engine was in it's fourth edition but I didn't have enough new features to update it.  Slowly, one by one, my acclaimed titles shrivelled up. I threw sequel after sequel together only to be met with underwhelming reviews. I had to let go one of my employees and halt the development on MMO technology. I was in the red after a few lack luster releases. I threw everything I had at Call of Doody 5, only to met with an resounding 'meh' by the reviewers. In a last ditch attempt I pieced together an update on my game engine but it was too late - the banks came knocking and the development never finished.   The unease and disappointment sat heavy in my stomach. My company was out no more.  This game gave me a serious case of the feels and for that, a solid recommendation.",

You are essentially playing to always get a higher score than your last so it benefits a player to sabotage their own success as they go in order to continue to achieve high reviews. The goals and values to be reached in order to get good reviews are all hidden and unclear. It is to your benefit to read a guide and play with some of the data tables open.  Two of the achievements are just ludicrous and seem to be wholly luck-based. One involves getting a value the game is seemingly coded not to produce with a score of 11/10? The other requires a sales total for a single game of 100 million or more which is excessively time consuming and nearly impossible if you didn't play correctly from the start, pacing your success by sabotaging yourself in order to maintain high scores and build a larger fanbase. It's ridiculous to the point where hacking game saves seems a more reasonable alternative to get those. The other achievements are far more reasonable, although the perfect 10 achievement also seems unreasonably luck-based.",

Made me want to own the game for myself and decided to buy it when it was on sale. Played through and I gotta say, this is one of the best tycoon games I've played. Even though it can seem a bit shallow since you always stay in one spot, the game keeps you entertained by adding new consoles or shutting down some making you think through your game releases. It can also get pretty funny as a ''party game'' with friends where you come up with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ names for games to then see them rise to the top of selling charts and to then have them known has your studio's biggest success.

Game Dev Tycoon the good: The gameplay in game dev tycoon is where it shines, in game dev tycoon you are a game developer starting out in a garage in somewhere USA, working to become one of the best game makers of all time. When you first start out there's 4 topics to choose from, and you learn more topics to do by researching them. Researching requires research points, don't have enough research points you gotta wait. Once you get into a higher place you can hire staff so your character doesn't have to do all the work and you can make bigger games and it can come faster. The final level really pays off and it's where you can make a lot of money, you can make your own console. You can also make your own MMO and your own version of steam, called 'GRID', make your own convention as well through the R&amp;D and Lab, there are also tons of mods on the Greenheart Games forums that will increase your gameplay experience, such as expansions, cheat mods, real names for consoles and multiplayer! Game dev Tycoon shines in the modding aspect. Now for the bad  Game Dev Tycoon feels like a guessing game/ wiki game you either, have to guess how to make a good game, sliding up and down random bars for different parts of the game. Or you have to reasearch it on the game dev tycoon wiki. It requires a lot of guesswork. You also don't know what the outcome of your game is. You can't even make a backstory even out of predetermined words. The interviews as well don't really let you choose what they are going to say, and you can't really tell what the reviews mean the reviews are absolutely useless.  Overall: Game Dev Tycoon is a really great indie game, hopefully if they make an expansion or put Game Dev Tycoon 2 out it will be better, Game Dev Tycoon is a 8.5/10 and for 9 bucks it's super cheap for the amount of time you are going to spend on it. It is addicting.",

More Grid - So when you get the research market up and design Grid ( Steam ) for games to be bought from, it would have been nice too see offers and requests for other indies and big named companys ( Capecom ETC ) wanting to pay you to put games on GRID to sell games from Virtually   4. ( your own Console here ) - If your gonna design your own system and it's gaining popularity more and more i would have loved to see companys release games for it like they would on the other consoles on the market. ( maybe not see the names of said games but at least have money go into your account each month from the Game Companys )    those are what i can think of at the top of my head. i felt that the last 2 i mentioned could have had more effect on game and the first two things i mentioned are things i wished to have seen in game.   But i totally recommend the game as it is pretty addictive and i felt like it's a Love Letter to us Gamers !",

And Game Dev Tycoon lays out these choices in a manner which is fun to play.  Still, after about 10 hours or so of gameplay, I think I’ve had enough. Unfortunately, there aren’t enough new elements to keep me playing in the late stages of the game. You’re almost forced to continue developing games over and over again for a source of income, but after doing this 40+ times I get the point (different options for MMOs, AAA games, etc. are added but the basic idea is exactly the same).  It’s an enjoyable game that I recommend it. Just don’t bet on playing it for more than a dozen or so hours.  My rating: 3/5",

            "review_text": "Aaalrighty then... What can be said about this ? This is problematic because the game is great if you look at it by its concept, but everything else is... Lackluster at best. I am trying my best not to sound biased, because i really enjoyed the game for what it was. But at the same time i also disliked it because of its mechanics, so i'm very between two opinions at the moment.  For starters i really didnt pay attention to the games history, only thing i know about it that its the studios first game and it was on Windows store, which if my memory serves was only on Win8.    No wonder people havent heard of it very much, before it went on STEAM anyway..    For the studios FIRST game this is a good example of stuff to come, however it has flaws in it and it felt rushed out. This was before the patch they published that repaired some of the issues. But even after said patch, the game still feels... Broken. Lets see if i can atleast explain those flaws and reason if there is a redeeming factor in it.  Graphics  The graphical style can be easily compared to several Facebook-games    Feel free to shout at me for that   , which i really cannot critique because it was the aesthetical choice. The game has a lot of colour, but unfortunately its sometimes too bright, thats if you play it in a dimly lit room. And the game also seems have some issues regarding the UI, it seems to be designed for a single resolution and it does not scale. when you play it in windowed-mode it breaks the UI 95% of the time if you dont set the window to certain proportions. However even with its problems the graphical design of the game serves its purpose of being nice to look at and it doesnt bore you easily untill you have played it into 'completion' atleast 5 times.   Music  There is not many musical tracks in this game and what there is, gets boring very easily. There are not many FX-sounds either. Besides clicking and 'blip' noices that the 'bubbles' do.   Gameplay  Well.. The gameplay is pretty much as it is in many other SIM/TYCOON-games, in that it has little interaction besides ticking boxes, watching the 'bubbles' gather and select the gategory ang genre of the games to develop. Later down the line, you have the option of making your own console. which sounds great, if it didnt have a problem of not showing the expected sales so you can atleast quess if developing your own 'Uber-underpowered-pc-mediacenter-w*nkbucket' would be worth the money it costs to make.  There also is the option of greating an MMO-game, which unfortunately has the same problems as the MMO's in real life. That is its needs to be that certain genre to actually appeal to the masses.    atleast for what i noticed, you would think that a M-rated Action-MMO with a decently lewd name would be awesome, but no.     The biggest problem that this game has, is that it gives almost no feedback. It was 'fixed' in the patch, but even with that its still a cr*pshoot if you actually set the sliders to their correct positions when you set the focus on development, even with the 'feedback' given by the Game-Report.   Did i miss something?... I think i didnt miss anything vital, i hope.   Conclusion  Although the game is flawed, it is still fun. I really cannot explain it, maybe because i was such a fan of Tycoon-games and The Sims, back in the day... But even with my slightly bias opinion, i really cannot overlook the obvious flaws that this game has.  I also dislike STEAM, because it doesnt give a third option when making a recommendation. I could easily give this game a 5/10 or something else in the middle, however i'm forced to only 'yes and no'. Ayyeeegghh.....  So because the game is flawed, and STEAM recommendation system is terrible. Against my better judgement, i am forced to give this game a thumbs up.",

It allows you to do what we all wish we could do; develop games!  It supplies that in a very nice way by using research to find new topics, modifications to add to your personal game engine, and train your workers/self to make even better games.  There is a subtle humour in the game by way of phony names such as Stephen Jobson as a designer, to having little easter eggs that I am not going to spoil. While the creation part of the game is a little bit of a learning curve, once you grasp the hang of it (Or use guides ;) ) it becomes a lot of fun to play. The feeling of reaching a perfect 10 score for a game you marketed like crazy and spent all your money on is the best, along with the incoming millions it brings. The progression is nice, the progression from the first office to the second takes a bit long for my taste. Having you make psuedo-strategic decisions in how you'll market or represent your game is a really nice touch and makes it more fun.  In all honesty I will give this game a 9/10 just because I feel like the creation part of it could be a bit more in depth. The simple sliders just doesn't do enough for me.",

Some of the writing is pretty funny, and the game is pretty addicting, but it feels like some of the gameplay should have been a bit more refined. You can't slow down or pause time to give commands to your employees, and after a game is released the popups and interruptions can fly at you pretty fast. Better analysis options in the game history would be fantastic; as it is, you can only scroll through your previous games in chronological order, but sorting by ranking, sales, profits, types, etc would be really useful. It's also oddly resource intensive, given that there are no complex graphics involved. And you can't change the screen resolution or display size, so whether I have the game in fullscreen or windowed, it still cuts off part of the screen. Still, I'd recommend it as a fun timewaster, and if you like Steam games, you're probably the kind of person who would love to pretend to be a game developer. Falls a bit short, but fun and it's probably worth a sale price.",

If one little critic is allowed, however, I'd make this one: Because of this speed in the gameplay, I noticed that some of the contents are way too much rushed through. The game could offer such a massive huge potential in terms of longevity, quality and quantity if the contet and developing of the characters from the personage we have down till the last employee we hire, from the first technology we develope and research down to the 1 Milion dollar Custom Engine we build. I mean, this game could really be a 'Large' game, a full scaled, fully developed game.

The time is now, joystick warrior. You enter your garage, walk past your rarely driven Delorian and face your greatest challenge. Creating the ultimate game, the one game that will put your company on the map, and change gaming history forever.    Game Dev Tycoon is the vehicle that will deliver you to your ultimate game creation fantasies, and does so brilliantly. As with all great indie developers, your journey begins modestly in the comfort of your garage. Though hours later, you may find yourself in a modern office, with a full staff maintaining the worlds greatest MMORPG. From reviews, to sales charts, this title takes you through every step in the process, for better or for worse. Gone are the days of complex simulations, streamlined and simple, Game Dev Tycoon delivers a casual, yet complete experience.   Do not let buzzwords like casual fool you though, I was still able to extract roughly eight hours of much needed escapism from this game, and had an absolute blast doing it. This game takes the addicting game-play at the core of every tycoon game and presents it in a fresh, easy to swallow, manner. Not to mention stuffed full of personality, gaming history, and love. What else would you expect from a developer by the name of Green Heart Games?   From R&amp;D, to marketing campaigns and creating your own console, this game runs the gamut of the video game industry from past, to present, and beyond. Can you steal market-share from the Xbox One and PlayStation 4? Or will your company go bankrupt trying to launch your next-gen MMO? It all comes down to your elite, or not so elite, management skills.    THE FINAL VERDICT   Overall this is a great title, and well worth the spare change you will spend on it. Polished graphics, straight forward, but challenging game-play are hard at work here. Complimented by great tone and sense of humor. Any hardcore gaming fan will love this tile. Though, buyer beware, this game WILL take many hours away from tending to your humanly duties.

My recommendation to anyone who wants to see this game as the developers intended is to play your first play through without looking up anything, will your results suffer for it, yes, but it gives you the feeling of an unpredictable market. My biggest warning to people trying this game is not to dive into its mechanics, all of which can easily be found online. I did this about half way through my first play through and it really does kill the experience. Ive seen people complain about it and I will agree that the system by which games are judged is a little silly at its core and can easily be manipulated to have yourself spitting out perfect games left and right. But at this point you've just turned it into a very shallow experience of number manipulation. If you take this game as its meant to be played there is a lot of fun, nostalgia, and some humor to be had and should keep you busy long enough to justify its price.",

I enjoy having a note in the game about the devs appreciating my purchase; makes me feel like I did good. I recommend this game to those who wonder what it would be like to be a game developer.

The game has settings that make it either a long-term or short-term play style, depending on what you prefer. There is an array of options when developing a game, whether it's a Hospital / Advenure game or a Vocabulary / Action game for Mature.

This game is very creative, and innovative, and has alot of fun gameplay allowing you to experiment allover the place in hopes you can find a miracle hit that will sweep the world by storm and make you millions. It is also a great historical review of the development of the gaming industry, starting with the original NES release, although they re-name everything with fun paraody names, the core historical content is there, and it's a great insight into how things happened in the past, while allowing you to be an active part of it. I have really enjoyed this game throughly, and I recommend it to anyone who wants something new and interesting to play.  &lt;minor spoilers here&gt; It would not be a fair review without also telling you about some of the negatives as well. In the case of Game Dev Tycoon it has alot of innovation but some of the features seem a little shortened and could have used more development. The way you publish and maintain MMOs seems lacking in real development and doesn't seem to be well thought out. They constantly raise the maintenance costs rather then having them reflect more realistically the cost to maintain certain numbers of users or even allowing you to choose how much budget to invest in the maintenance of the game yourself. Instead, the maintance costs go up every month until there's no way sales can pay for the maintenance, and you have to release an expansion pack, which will reset the maintenance cost for awhile, but it starts going back up again. I don't find this to be at all an accurate model of how an MMO's maintenance runs.   Another issue is with the scoring system, instead of being a more logical system it instead forces you to go against your own internal 'high score' which uses an obfuscated algorithim to calculate the final reviewer score that will determine your sales and popularity with any particular title. It seems like they didn't want it to be straightforward, or just impossible to predict. The algorithim rewards consistency instead of innovation and creativity...it's literally better if you stick to a generally same performance rather then strive to be better. I don't understand how that's a realistic model either.   They also seem to have forgotten about things like crowd funding, gnu licensce releases, focus groups, playtesting, the puzzle genre, and other details that would flesh it out massively.  Building a console in the game is a sadly simple process that isn't really that...fun. You pick a name, what graphics engine it will feature, and choose from a set of premade variations and that's it. You can't elect to use motion controllers, or a kinect kind of system..there's no options to modularly design it yourself, etc. I find it extremely limited.   The game seems to be missing alot of extra management stuff, in MMo's, console releases, and even the Digital Distribution platform you can make... I would very much like to see this game fleshed out much further through DLC or a sequel. If I were them, I would take most of the money they made from this game release, and re-invest it into making a better one now that they have more capital. (I do it in the game all the time!)  In light of some of the limitations and negatives, I still recommend this game and I still very much enjoy it within the scope that is has. However, I would not pay 10 bucks for this, so if you are considering purchasing this title, I would suggest you wait for a sale.",

I have put a good 21 hours into this game and i beat it after 12 hours, this game is replayable and it takes forever to even unlock everything! This game has an open file for any coders that enjoy screwing around with the files and codes. Haven't you always wanted to make video games at some point in your life? Well this gives you the chance to do so. From small games for the 'Vony PPS' to triple A MMo's for the 'Vony Playsystem 5', 'The mBox Next', or even your own console! You can even release sequels for games and expansion packs for your MMO's, you start in a garage and you work your way up to a office with employees! I highly reccomend this hilarious/enjoyable game for anyone interested in a fairly cheap time waster. Thanks guys :)",

It provides some challenge, and that keeps the replay value up.  Obviously, there are many omages to the history of gaming, particularly console gaming, and that is fun to read the first time. However, after you play through it once, you will be skipping through those. That being said, the challenge of creating new and varied games will keep you coming back for a good little while.  My only complaint lies in the game creation algorithim. Becuase it is based on comparing your newest game to your previous best game, it can be difficult to consistently produce high level games. Sometimes, it feels like the gauge for a games ratings is a bit random, and you are surprised at both flops and successes, but not in the good way.  I recommend it because there is enough to make it enjoyable for a number of playthroughs, and the price point isn't too bad, either. On sale, it is a good pick-up.",

I decided to give this game a try and conquer the gaming world one release at a time.   The positives: Once you release a few hit games, things can take off rather quickly. Your money starts to grow, your fan base increases, and the elements you can use to improve your games is almost limitless. There are option mini missions in the form of 'contract work' and 'publisher deals', but which ask you to achieve a desired outcome, otherwise pay a severe penalty.   The negatives: The first hour or two of the game can be extremely boring. You have the option of about 4 genres of games to create and very little to do until your capital begins coming in. The other thing I'm not fond of is how a game/combination can go over so amazingly at one point and not much later sink like a rock. I can't even begin to count the number of times I thought I had a hit on my hands, only to have the game receive horrible reviews. Also, the lack of detail on subjects and genres doesn't help either. What exactly is a 'comedy' as it relates to video games? Or 'alternative history' for that matter?   Game Dev Tycoon is a great game that I've enjoyed playing thus far, but it does have it quirks.

        {
            "review_text": "It's a cute little Tycoon game where you start off as a solo garage developer in the wake of the Videogame crash of '83. Your only options for publishing are the PC and the G=64 (Stand in the the Commodore 64, sorry Apple 2 and ZX Spectrum fans, you're outta luck) and you have a limited number of topics and game types you can develop.  As the game goes on, you gain research points for working on games and engines, which you can spend to research new topics, new game components and effects, and to train your character(s). This is all functional, but it's missing something. For one, the only way to gain research points is to make a game or develop an engine (you also get a small number for doing a post-mortem on your game, but I consider that part of the development process). This means that when your game is complete, you can learn new techniques to put in your engine, which gives you more research which... well, you can't research anything and put it in your engine unless you do two engine builds between games, which is just silly.   In fact, it's actually more efficient to go several cycles on an engine and only update it when you have a good number of things to add. However, doing this leaves you with fewer research points, and on and on it goes. It's not really that big of a deal, and I do appreciate a balancing act in resource management in my tycoon games, but the structure and pacing of this one just feels off.  The second issue with the game comes up as a weird interface quirk after you move out of the garage and hire a team of developers to work for you. The game tells you that you need to periodically send your employees on vacation in order to keep them fresh, but the stamina meter is not really intuitive (it only shows up at all when they're close to being fatigued, and there is no tooltip if you hover over it to see what this unmarked meter means) and is exacerbated by the game giving you only the most cryptic of clues that this is affecting their performance.   After developing a couple games, your employees will stop contributing or gaining experience. When running your post-mortem, the game will tell you, 'You should include your entire team in the development of your games,' even though you very clearly did just include them all. What this actually means is that while you included them, they didn't contribute due to fatigue. It's a very bad bit of interface messaging. This is further exacerbated by the other problem with the Vacation interface. You only get the option to them on vacation when they have reach a level close to fatigue, So you can start development on a game with no indication that they're fatigued, and then by the end of development, they run out of gas and your game tanks as a result.   You can also only send them on vacation by clicking each character and choosing the 'send on vacation' option from the menu. There is no option to send them all at once, which becomes problematic when you expand your operation. Different developers will get fatigued at different times when they aren't hired together, and it can take years, and multiple botched or degraded games to get them all in sync again when you hire a new team member.   The ideal cycle for vacations seems to be Make game - Do Research - Build Engine, and by this point, they should start showing a fatigue meter, so you send them all out before starting development on the next game. However, as previously discussed, building an engine after every game is a huge waste of money, so you basically have to just sit there and do some crappy contract work or nothing at all until they're ready to send out. The game could have been made much better by including a 'Send whole team on vacation' option at any point.   Beyond those issues, it's a cute little game that hits a lot of nostalgia buttons, even if it does leave out several entire consoles (Sorry Saturn and GBA - Get ♥♥♥♥ed) while bizarrely including an announcement of the SNES CD attachment from Sony, and canceling it a day later. I enjoyed building my little game empire once I figured out how to manage vacations, and ended the game with almost a billion dollars stashed away and a portfolio including several 15Million+ sellers. It does become a bit formulaic, as you do a couple new ideas looking for a new hit franchise, then switch back to the safe sequels to prior hits every few game cycles.   One other minor quibble it that it seems like the game rewards you for creating the 'most' game, rather than the best one. You're basically never better off creating a smaller game once you make a decent bigger one. Including every single latest-and-greatest option in every game seems to be the best way to success, even if those options make absolutely no sense for the game you're creating. (Transport Simulation with advanced dialog trees, moral choices, and as many cinematic cutscenes as you can get - GO!) I guess in a way it could be taken as a meta-commentary on the people who buy games, but it doesn't make this game any better mechanically as a result. You pretty much have to make the biggest thing you possibly can every single time or you get 1s and 2s when it comes to review time.",

The playtime for a 'campaign' should be between 8 and 10 hours, so this is great for those who don't feel like investing too much time in this game. Unfortunately some people might not find the game to hold that much in the way of replay value, so I suggest waiting for Game Dev Tycoon to go on sale before investing.  The graphics are perfectly fine, though players might find themselves wishing there were more options to customise the look and feel of the game. There also aren't that many settings, though the game runs fine for the most part so most people won't run into problems. You're blessed with a windowed option so you can keep checking the wiki for guides!  The sounds are great - the popping of design and technology bubbles as you make a game is the audio equivalent of bubblewrap. The ka-ching sound you'll hear as your brainchildren enter the market also help to make the game an incredibly awarding and addictive experience. Unfortunately the soundtrack leaves a little to be desired, but I don't think anyone going into this is going to care.  Overall it's a decent game - maybe wait for a sale, but it's a nice way to spend a lazy afternoon.",

The Pros: Progresses Well Nice Graphics Small Download Good Gameplay Kept me Enthralled  The Cons: Some of the console releases are non existant (PS2 Slim, Xbox 360 Slim, PS3 Slim, etc)  Short, I was able to beat the game in 5.9 Hours on my first try.  Needs more animations. The animations in the game are good, but after 10 mins you've seen them all.   Only 3 Workshop areas/Offices in there game (as far as I have seen) there is only 3 Office spaces, which does not leave a lot of room for diversity. I mean I was coding games with the equivelent of DOS, and these game were going onto the most up to date gaming systems.  I know most of the Cons are just nitpickey little things, but they're all I have found so far.",

Pros - Increadibly gripping experience - Sliders for the main choices ingame, any other system would have made it a bit too tedious - UI is intuitive and simple, yet brings out a lot of information - Good selection of choices on which areas to improve (ie: You want to improve your employees with training or do you want to improve your company by getting that new game engine pumped out for your next game release?)

And then asked me to guess which priorities I should set for five or six basic genres of games, not counting the multi-genre. And the answer is not simple, 'cause this game wants you to answer by moving sliders, research stuff and putting features in games. All that while making money and watching the options exponentially proliferate. This calls for an example. It's 1984, you're developing an action game for the C64 with some aliens in it, and you know you're going to invest some extra effort in basic 2D Graphics, and maybe you should put a Savegame feature in, or even some tutorial, and let's not forget about AI, because nothing says 'boss fight' like a changing move and attack pattern. Now, you're in 2014, developing a Post-Apocalyptic-themed Action-RPG, and after seriously thinking about multiplatform, you chose to save money and keep it a PS4 exclusive. The genre alone is very well received on that particular console. You should surely include features like advanced physics and mod support, skill trees and character progression, dynamic environment and the absence of loading screens, AI companions and some spectacular graphics... But that's not all. Should you make it single player, online play or plain MMO? Are you going to invest effort and resources in having a dynamic world, or maybe a virtual economy? How well written, acted and voiced will the dialogues be? That's what I meant for 'proliferating options' and believe me, that was the short version.  Only thing I miss, this game does have mod support, but I can't find one single mod that could intrigue me ad the original game did. I still hope to see something interesting there, anyway.",

I would definitely recommend Game Dev Tycoon for anyone who is a fan of tycoon games or want to try one for the first time!",

It teaches you about the game industy, it has all the pasts best consoles come on the market the accurat times they did in real life, and also had them exit the market the accurate times they did in real life as well. So it does teach you a lot about today and yesterdays consoles.  Pros -  This game has a great amount of time, not to long, not to short. Just right!!!  This game runs very smooth with no lag on high end. and low end PCs!!!  This game has a wide variety of things to do, and you have to unlock a lot of them making the story more fun!!!  This game has an amazing replay value, which i will defently replay this game and add hours!!!  This game has amazing mod support, and the workshop has some pretty wacky and useful mods to improve the game!!!   Cons -   This game can get a little buggy and laggy for some workshop mods, including cheat mods that improve money!!!  This game does not have that good of an ending, but i will let you guys find that out for yourselves!!!  This game does not really have anymore updates, but what can you expect from a two year old game!!!  This game can be played after beating the game, but it starts to get a little boring after you officially beat it endless you start a new game, (basically when you beat the game start a new one or else you will get real bored real quick!!!)   Thats all the game is defenetly more good than it is bad, and it is worth the 10$ you will spend on it. I already beat it in 7 hours but im not complaining that i cant get a refund because i want to continue playing this game. For those who bought this two years ago should still be playing it and for thoe who have not bought or played it yet get your wallet out and spare 10$ for this masterpiece, it is worth every penny and second of time you spend on it!!!",

About 5 hours later, I blink my eyeballs for the first time since the beginning of the play session. I love the simple yet stimulating mechanics of this game. For example, your games that you create are given a rating ranging from 1-10 (and sometimes 11) after you complete it. Since you start out as a noob, of course you're going to get low to medium scores. The moment this game sucks you in is when a reviewer gives you a 7. I remember I fist bumped the air on my first 7. And it's this reward system that compliments the game's punishment system. Not only can you make hits, but you inevitably will make flops. There's nothing that hurts more than making a 3 game. I also liked how this game shows the pressures of an industry that we gamers often over look. Too many times in my life have I played a game and cursed out the developers for making a crap game for a quick buck. Well this game makes you understand why developers sell out to big publishers and making crappy games. It instills in you the stress of being on the verge of bankruptcy and having to fire your staff. I do have a couple of complaints with this game though. The entire game suggests that each genre of game has to conform to a structure. For example, an action game will not do well if you focus your energy on the story and an adventure game will not succeed if you focus time on the engine. This type of structure limits the creativity the art form brings, suggesting that games should be made with a similar formula. Also, the game includes a feature where you can create your own console. While neat, you cannot release any third party games on the system, leaving each console you make as the PS Vita (shots fired). It would be nice if the developers could incorporate a mechanic in which you are able to sign with a third party developer. Overall, this game is truly a delight. It gives you a sneak peak into the developer's world. Though it is slowed down by small details, the reward/punishment system and the immersiveness of the world more than makes up for it and will keep your eyes glued to the screen.",

FINE I'll give you your precious review! All jokes aside though this game is so much fun. It has a bit of a pattern to making games once you get the hang of it. I've put a lot of time and only did one play through that I am still on.   My company is worth $10 billion and shows NO signs of slowing down. Is it easy? No, its kinda hard to get 10/10 games but they launch your company's value and income. The management is fair and is pretty fun to manipulate and learn which things go with which genres. i.e World design, sound, graphics, etc.   You can make everything from mobile games to Massively Multi-Player Online games. Tons of genres to pick from and make games out of, and if you're like me with a good company you can afford to get goofy with the games.   It runs pretty solid, however I do have a nice system, and it runs well until you get a lot of 'bubbles' from the developement of a game going, then theres a bit of lag, but nothing to really make much of a difference.   So, there you have it. The damn review you just HAD to have.. Don't care if its not enough, it should be, NOW BUY, you can thank me later.",

I don't feel like there is much replay value to it, it's always the same upgrades and the same story. Maybe if you like a challenge and try to get as far as possible before the 35th year in game you'd have some replay value, but that's pretty much the only thing I see.   It's fun for a couple of hours, but once you find something that works well, you just keep the formula, stack a lot of money and do the same thing over and over, pretty much. It gets very repetitive.  I'd say it's worth to buy if the game is on sale, not at full price.",

I feel like it offers a fun yet complex experience and although it lacks true endgame, I've spent hours after my game's finished just developing high-quality games, without having to worry about budget as I've made all my money in the main game.  If you're into tycoons and are considering getting it, I'd say go for it. At £6.99 I've put more hours into it than some other £20 games.",

Ostensibly, this is a game along the lines of AeroBiz or Railroad Tycoon, where your job is to run a company and make lots of money, in this case by developing video games. It's got a cute, quirky aesthetic and some interesting pseudo-RPG elements, which is neat, but...  Well, frankly, this game seems incredibly, frustratingly random.  To wit; I spent about an hour bankrupting my company by making what seemed like completely rational, reasonable choices for a game developer to make. Making text adventures for the PC seemed like a good idea, for example. But it turns out text adventures are a dead-end because you can't level up other areas, which cripples you long-term. It also seems to penalize actual CREATIVITY; for example, I can think of a half-dozen awesome ways to do a Wild West-themed strategy game using SNES-level tech. However, Wild West and Strategy, as far as this game is concerned, Do Not Go Together, so no matter how WELL I make the game, it will tank in reviews and sell nothing.  Frustrated, I decided to look up guides of game/genre combos, and discovered that you pretty much have to make certain TYPES of games to have any chance of success. So, I tried again, this time slavishly obeying the standards of what genre/theme combos were optimal, setting development resources to the 'perfect' levels... and my games still tanked and sold like crap. The algorithm for how a game reviews seems to have NOTHING AT ALL to do with the actual Design and Tech points; I've had games in the 20s for Design and Tech earn millions and games where they were both high-60s get scores of 4s and 3s, during the SAME YEAR.  I feel like there's a significant difference between how the game ACTUALLY works and how the game TELLS YOU it works. Like, design and tech score obviously mean SOMETHING, but WHAT? There's no context for what '1 point of design' actually SIGNIFIES. And when you introduce the Hype Factor and the Review Scores, both of which are different numbers that are factored in different ways -it doesn't explain to you-, the result is a game where you're basically comparing three different types of numbers measured on three different scales which all clearly interact, but how that interaction actually occurs is completely opaque and arcane. Then you stack the game engine add-ons, none of which seem to ACTUALLY contribute much to overall finished product as much as 'not having this thing by this in-game year will tank your scores.' It doesn't feel like a game so much as a random number generator with pseudo-meaningful choices.  I can't make sense of this game. I tried playing it blind, and I tried playing it with a guide, and both options resulted in roughly the same end-result. As much as I like the concept and aesthetic, I just can't really recommend it.",

            "review_text": "It wasn't an easy choice to give this game a thumbs down. I really want to like this game. I researched it, saw some people playing it on YouTube, read the comments about the non-intuitive choices and how they were supposedly fixed. Sad thing is that the game is still really non-intuitive, so I cringe at wondering how bad it was before. These are my thoughts, and I have NOT looked at any wikis for help on the game yet. I wanted to leave an unbiased opinion as a new player.  I'll start with the positives:  1. The graphics are cutesy, Flash-looking, what you'd expect on an iPhone game or a free online game.  2. The music is... ok.  3. I understand that the devs couldn't use certain copyrighted things, like the names of consoles, so the parodies are funny. (although if someone would just make a mod that renames all the consoles to what everyone knows they are it would be great.)  4. It's interesting to see console launches and deaths relative to each other based on real history.  5. There are a lot of choices to research, things to train your devs on, and genres / styles of games available.   Negatives / things I would change:  1. There are almost TOO many choices of things to research from the beginning of the game. I don't know if they dry up later, as I'm only on the 3rd or 4th office building. The overwhelming choices force you to pigeon-hole your company into specializing so you're constantly feeling limited, or leashed. I also had a hard time with researching new game genres to stay fresh vs researching new components to include in game engines. From what I can tell, certain choices / combos are worth way more than others, and since it's loosely based on history, if you make a romantic dating sim for the 'xbox' you aren't going to get anywhere, so why have these choices if it's based on history? This leads me to my next issue:  2. While the history is neat, it would be super kick ♥♥♥ if there was an optional setting to randomize launches and market share of upcoming consoles, so you don't know which ones you should support. It would add some RNG nightmares and I'm sure backing the wrong console could potentially bankrupt you sooner, but it would add a more realistic feel to the game. If you can unlock a mode like this eventually then disregard this statement. One thing that bothered me was that you start out with PC / C64, and then skip ahead to Nintendo. What happened to Atari or Intellivision? Rather than trying to show off these parodies of console we all know and love, I think the game could have been a lot stronger if this facet was randomized.  3. The game doesn't seem to have as much 'sim' as I'd like. You don't price your game at launch. You just 'finish' it and watch money trickle in. I'm not sure if games sell for different prices as you move on to newer consoles or if they're just a generic set price throughout the game. Having the ability to sell a game for cheap to gain market share / fans would have been nice. On the flipside, if you're cocky and think your game is going to get high reviews then you can price it higher. It would have been a nice feature to have. I also don't like the economy. The numbers seem to have been made in balance to itself, not based on real economic figures. I'm only a few office buildings in and I already have ~$100,000 per month in expenses, most notably paying my devs five to six figures PER MONTH. This is ridiculous, paying game devs a year's worth of salary per month. This is a huge oversight, and I'm sure they just threw it together like this to keep the game 'challenging' or something. It makes it hard to get a feel for what these fake dollars are really worth.  4. The genres and types of games you can make do end up giving you hints for the future, as to what works well together and what doesn't. What bothers me is how non-intuitive it is. You basically have to guess which combos are good, and then on what system, only learning after the game launches what works. What I don't like is that it's difficult to SEE what works well together unless you open up certain menus while creating your next game. If the UI would just open little popups when you mouseover something to give you more info on these sorts of stats it would make the game much smoother. Instead, you have to back out of menus and open other menus to see certain stats. You also can't just mouseover or click open stats of your devs, you have to open a screen as if you wanted to research something new to see their stats when all you really want to do is check their stats. If you could just mouseover the sections within the development stages to see the stats instead of the cryptic +++ or -- it would help so much.   5. There are NO confirmation menus. The game is kind of fast paced, and really it's a sim on game dev MANAGEMENT, not game development. You seem to have to spend more time on what your employees are doing than anything else. Every menu you open to choose something for the direction of the game you're making has no confirmation screen, so if you forget to include an option in your game engine, or forget to pick the right dev for a section of design, there are no Mulligans. You're stuck with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ choice that could cost you millions, when all you need is a simple 'Continue?' box.  6. Time is constant unless you open a menu to pause the game. There is no pause button. You can't speed up or slow down time, and it does feel like it moves a little too fast, usually. Instead of a 'diner dash' type action game where you're trying to juggle choices, I'd rather have more sim than this arcade fast paced feel.   All these negative things put together do add up to an experience that could use a little more depth and a lot more intuition. Players shouldn't have to look up formulas on wikis to learn how to play the game better. Add in just a couple of little UI tweaks, and more depth to the simulation and you'll have a fantastic game instead of one that just goes through the motions like a cheap iPhone free to play game. I waited until the game was on sale for $5 and I do feel like it's still overpriced.  I'd wait on purchasing it until the devs add some kick ♥♥♥ updates or something.",

You pick a genre, game type, platform, engine, and target audience. Then as time progresses you go through 3 phases of development. Each of the 3 phases have 3 areas you can have your developers put their time into. Every game type requires specific things from a developer. This is where the game gets mindless. Even though you can't make 2 games back to back of the same genre, you can have the same game type FOREVER. You can just make RPGs... and switch game genres from Sci-Fi to Dungeon or Medieval. The game lasts 35 years so its literally 35 years of just coming out with the same game. Between games you can train your developers, research things to help with your game engines or take on contract work for some extra money.... unless you fail.  Another giant issue I have with the game is there is no real randomization. Nintendo will always win the early video game wars, Gameboy will always stick around for far too long, and RPGs geared for young players will always dominate. oh and another giant issue is when you start out, you don't have a team of developers, you are just the only developer and ALWAYS at around year 4 you'll have a hit game that will thrust you into having a game studio.  Even though I've played through the game a few times for my love of management games. I always dominate the RPG portable market. I don't feel any sort of need to make anything else. Usually once the office gets larger, the game just gets boring. I'd love it if there was a randomization to ensure something makes each play through unique.  It is also interesting that on my laptop I had Game Dev Tycoon before it was on Steam and it worked. But with Steam the game doesn't work on my laptop. It works on my other two computers. Oh well.  In all I think people will love running their own game development studio, but in the end, this feels like a very hollow game.

For anyone that hasn't looked into it, Game Dev Story, out on mobile devices currently, has been around for quite some time, and while Greenheart has put JUST BARELY enough unique features and formats to make it different from it's ancestor, it has done very little to make it stand on it's own two feet.  It's overall a good ride, but I feel like it's one I just got off. And a simple homage, even a mere mention of Game Dev Story, would have probably made this game sit a lot better with me. But pawning it off as something they CREATED doesn't shine a positive light on the humble Greenheart.",

Unfortunately, I cannot see myself playing this game for and longer than I currently have. After completing it once, I just got fed up of the same thing over and over and over. I then realized that basically the entire game was typing some words and sliding some bars to adjust what the game is like. If this would in any way simulate game development then the developers definitely have not had any experience making a good game. Now, before you question I do know that games such as Roller Coaster tycoon also do not simulate creating a theme park, however what the developers did was look at it from a creative aspect, and allow the player to let their imagination flow, and build to their heart's content. What this game does not do. It is just a series of researching new stuff, then sliding some sliders and making a new game. After my first playthrough of the game I would certainly rate this much higher, perhaps even a six or seven. However, this game just gets absolutely boring, and anyone who has ten or more hours on this game, must be extremely devoted to the opposite of fun, and doing extremely boring 'tasks'.",

The game is fun to a point. It allows you to feel like you're developing games, creating new franchises and consoles in your image, making the games you want become the best. However, this is about as far as it goes and in the later stages of the game this excitement at creating the games tends to get a little stale. To my first point, I would recommend this game if you got it while on sale and if you use it as a meaningless distraction, maybe on your break at work or something.   However, as a stand alone game with the aim to creating a gaming industry it falls a little short, if anywhere, on the rewards of such. As others have mentioned your games get rated based on a very sketchy out of ten by four different dudes that seem to have no particular focus on any aspects of the games. This scores then get based onto your previous games according to how good your previous title was and how good the current one is. While this can be realistic (come on, admit that you sometimes say a game is crap just because it's not as good as a previous game in that series despite that on it's own it would be considered pretty damn good) it doesn't add to the gameplay and instead serves as more of an annoyance and demotivator.  Most of the other features are pretty decent but nothing more than you would expect from a decent flash game. The effects of adding features to your game engine and then trying to implement it into your games are rarely noticed and I felt that if anything it restricted me from making the ideal game. I felt that there were too many moments that I had to sacrifice important aspects to a game in favour of others purely because they would not be completed on time. While I understand it's the developer basically saying that you can never get everything you want in a game otherwise it would take too long to produce, most of the features that I have to choose between I know are in pretty much most games nowadays so that still detracts from what we have in our world now.   Overall, this game is a decent crack at a unexplored mini genre (Game dev) with a well thought out game production process. However, there was a small problem in the execution and a couple of the feautres didn't really add to the gameplay and instead detracted from it. A good game when idling, but nothing to sit down to and play solidly.   If I had to give it a score I would put it around 5/10.",

The game stops being fun for me basically when you move out of the garage. From there its just a tedious frustrating guessing game ♥♥♥♥ fest even with the guide and each genre and topic. The whole rating system of having to constantly top your last best game sucks, the game would probably be fun if scores were determined some other way.  I like indie games, most of my purchases now are indie and early access games, but really later on when I am technically cheating by using the genre and topic break down guides and after I get my first 9 or 10/10 then from that point on its like 2 dozen+ games that get rated 3-6 with maybe one 7-8 in a blue moon, it's not really a fun experience.  Obviously a lot of people who bought the game don't stuggle to enjoy it like I do, I've had this game long before it ever came on steam but I can tell you id probably never recommend this game to anyone let alone ever buy another game from this developer.

The first play through of this game is very fun, but also very punishing.  You start with just you, your garage, and a default engine to create your first game. The games tutorial is very in depth, explaining to you pretty much everything you need to know to get started and there you are, on your way to being a massive developer.   The first problem for me arouse pretty quickly. The game has a set cycle. Every time you play it it WILL be the same. The game works by periodically releasing new consoles onto the market in the same order that the consoles were released at the same point each playthrough, and nothing changes. You see that console that you just bough a licence for at 1,000,000? Yeah well it's doomed to fail. Nothing you can do can prevent this thus taking any type of strategy out of the game. You'll find yourself either thinking back to which consoles flopped in real life or just remembering which consoles to avoid completely once you play through a second time.  I find this to be a huge flaw in a game like this. Simulation games should have some level of replayability and besides getting the achievements (which I actually think can be done in a single playthrough) there is none at all.  There are also some elements of the game which are not properly explained at all, such as releasing hardware along side an AAA game, what your expensive AAA marketing campaign does for your game and the proper structure of MMO's which can become frustrating but by the time I encountered these I was sitting on enough money to trial and error them a few times.  However, what is NOT Acceptable is that the game doesn't properly explain it's algorithm to you. Your game score is not based upon the game you make itself, rather the game compared to your previous games. As you can imagine the longer the game goes on, the harder it becomes to release a game that gets a score more than 5. I believe if you played this game indefinitely this algorithm would cause a point to come where it would be physically impossible to create any game with a good score, simply because you've done it before. I find this level of punishing past success to be offputting, and honestly, somewhat weird.   I think the game could have been greatly improved with a few minor features like randomizing the consoles success, market share and maybe even like Theme Hospital have 'competing' companies that release games also.   The being said I found the game very fun. The graphics are simple and colourful, the gameplay is mostly relaxed and there is enough content to keep you happy for at least a single playthrough (or a good 10 hours), but don't expect to want to play it again once it's completed. If the game goes on sale then it is worth picking up but don't expect a true tycoon experience where you have an adaptable/changeable economy/market.",

After that, upgrading to a studio and having a team of developers it then becomes impossible to rank in comparison and scores drop from those 10s to 4s thereby damning your hopes of publishing games without losses for not scoring high enough reviews.  I did some research into the game theory of these mechanics and while the game appears to be open and controllable you really have no control. Basically you need to just pick predefined combinations of game genres, systems, and target age groups. There is no dynamic changes in the game, it is just rote memorization. Ultimately it comes down to a giant matrix and either you do exactly as the matrix says or you face extreme penalties.   I can't really recommend this game. If you own mobile devices the Game Dev Story from Kairosoft is superior. While GDS is simpler in some ways it does not suffer the overwhelming core flaw of this game.

The goal of the game is to make games that are slightly, if marginally better the each previous game. If you make to rapid advancements and innovation too quickly than your games wont get more 'points' and you plateau. It becomes very tedious, and for what? A question I cannot answer.  Final Thoughts: Going into this game I thought the point was to be innovative, make the best games you can and beat the compitition. But that is not the case, there is no compitition. The goal is to make crappy games, and games that are slightly less crappy than the last to bank on the system and become the next virtual EA. That's not my cup of tea.  If thats your thing go for it, but for me I was not impressed and this game is more of a novelty item if anything. If your really looking for a game dev simulator than it will scratch that itch for a brief moment and overall is 'lacking'.  4/10 Would not recommend  P.S. I was sold by the overwhelming positive reviews, but shortly realized my mistake. This game is a fun gimmick, but fades pretty fast. If the mechanics where better or there were other companies to compete with, and it was a race to get ahead and build a company that does at least something better than the others like how the big companies of today got going, which was what I expected, then this review would be much higher. But as it stands it was not even close. Perhaps I had my hopes to high, perhaps I was expecting something that 'Game Dev Tycoon' would offer, perhaps I was just foolish thinking a 96% favorable game could not disappoint.",

            "review_text": "Honestly this game gets a neurtral score but this is not possible to do so negative it is. This game is addictive in a short burst. It is the type of game that the 'dollar per hour' rule applies in that you will spend at least 10 hours on this game and you will enjoy those 10 hours or more. That being said the game is inherently flawed in its design. You are constantly trying to beat your previous score. What amounts from that is there is no one to compete with. There are other companies but only in name only. You do not get to see what they create or even scores they get, only that they may be there in the form of a publishing company. The game feels more like a flash game in dynamics and limits yourself to repetitive asset distribution that leaves no variability. Everything comes down to following a formula, it is the type of game where you could literally follow a step by step manual and there would not be the least bit of a problem. The game mechanics are even limited in that regard it feeels too simplistic but vague. It has many interesting nods to previous gaming consoles and follows how they would fair in the game market during the concurrent time but other than that, they are not versitile at all. I made a game with level 3 3d graphics for the equivelent of the original game boy. It isn't the problem with this not following how the gameboy or other consoles were in reality, it is the problem with little to no restrictions to how these consoles work. They are, again, just a medium for reaching an audience and not a deciding factor in much game design.  overall this game is super enjoyable at first, you will enjoy it for the 10+ hours no problem. Just be careful when you pass that mark as the game's problems become more pertinent",

            "review_text": "GDT is primarily a game of slider adjustment. If, for example, you wish to produce a game of the Action genre, then during Stage 1 of development you'll wish to set the Engine slider to 100%, the Gameplay slider to 80%, and the Story slider to 0%. Meanwhile, your only competition is yourself, and every time you outperform yourself, you raise the bar. If you don't exceed the standard you've set for yourself, improving every game over the last, then your ratings will suffer, and so will your sales. Critics and customers aren't concerned about whether or not you've produced a good game, or an entertaining game. They're interested in whether or not you've produced a game that was statistically better than your last. You'll find yourself frustrated in no time, getting real cozy to all the GDT strategy guides and spreadsheets that litter the internet.   My first game started out enjoyable. I was fascinated by the nostalgia of the Comadore 64 and Nintendo. I liked giving my games titles and momentarily daydreaming about what each would be like. It didn't take long before I adjusted a games sliders luckily and scored my first big hit. Little did I realize the critics and customers would never be accepting of anything less after that. From that point on it was all frustration, confusion and work, eventually leading to bankrupcy during the PS2 era. The next game, I spent most of my time reading those guides and refering to those spreadsheets I mentioned earlier, strategically planning everything with precision. I even downloaded a series of mods that did such things as display percentages in the sliders, for precision purposes. I left nothing to chance, and yet I again found myself bankrupt during the PS2 era.   Before the third playthrough, I must've spent an hour scouring the internet like an NSA agent reading and rereading Vladamir Putin's autobiography and hacked personal correspondance. Finally, I tried one last time, nearly found myself bankrupt during the PS2 era again, but I won with $4.5 billion in my account. Was it worth it? No. There's a lot of examples of 'the wrong execution of the right idea' here. That bar raising I spoke of earlier being one. GDT is unmercifully, artificially and ridiculously difficult. From what I've read, that seemed to be more true with each update released for GDT. They found any patch of fresh air within the game, capped it off, and left the player suffocating. For example, MMO's have been nerfed to the point that insane, rapid and unending rises in server maintenance will leave you broke in no time flat, expansion packs or not. This is, in essense, a game of gaming the game, never playing the game. It's work, not fun. From what I've read, the game used to be fun, but in it's current and apparently final state, it's not. You'll find no joy here.  Unless you're a masochist: steer clear. Find something to play that'll actually be fun.",
