The Bad: 1: Poor 3rd person control. 2: Not 'action' enough. 3: 'HARD' is too hard. 4: Enemies are very stupid. 5: Command system takes time to learn and familiar with.   ",

It's missions are not all that linear but that's to expected from early 2000 shooters. The sounds design is still alright and the AI is competent....ish. And yes the grapics are a bit dated. But overall I would say if your looking for a good squad based third person shooter get this",

            "review_text": "A dated game, but with a semblence of nostalgia to the lucky ones who grew up with this series (amongst others).  The controls are clunky, the AI is stupid and unfair in terms of stealth detection, the missions have you take on entire garrisons of troops (which is fine by me) and then there's the look of the game. Don't get me started on the sound.  To anyone who stumbles over this the for first time, drop it unless you're interested in a semi-decent co-op game, which might last you a weekend or two.  If you're a veteran of the series and looking to get back into it, I say drop this one and get Desert Storm II: Back to Baghdad (or get this one and then get Back to Baghdad).  At the end of the day, however, I must still recommend it, because I would be doing a disservice to all the fun memories I had with this game back when it first came out. It's a lacking game, but anyone who played this on the consoles either loved it or is a bunch of negativity I don't need in my life.",
