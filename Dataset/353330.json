            "review_text": "When you look past the strange heroine,  Love at First Sight  is a pretty straightforward high school romance VN. There's no ero in the game itself, but it has a few ero-guro undertones that might be off-putting for some. Even so, there's a certain soft grace to it all; Ray-K's painterly style brings warmth and tenderness to every scene, catching the restrained giddiness of young love in a way that might be lost with cleaner, flatter designs. It is, in a word, comfy.  The characters are likeable, for the most part, with Sachi standing head and shoulders over any run-of-the-mill moeblob love interest. She invites sympathy and the urge to protect, but her vulnerability never really grates. The music doesn't stand out by any means, but its gentleness supports the cozy atmosphere well.  There is very little beyond the story's single path, unfortunately — about two hours of content in all. Even the most casual reader will chew through it quickly, and depending on their tastes, they'll probably be left wanting more. It's perhaps not enough to warrant the full $10. But if it's on sale and you have five bucks to spare, time spent on crisp autumn back-streets with a cute cyclops girl is time well invested.  Admittedly, I might be biased here; that wide, bottomless eye will ease open your chest and grope the scars. But isn't that the point?  Pick this up if you enjoy cutely macabre aesthetics, monster girls, romance, and if you see it on sale.  --- + Cute monster girl heroine + Cozy autumn setting + Warm, comfy art style + The extra features serve as a fun little epilogue and development backstory + When you're done with the story and extras, check the creator's Pixiv for a bit more  - Only one story path - That one path is a little bare-bones and straightforward - At 2-3 hours, the VN is extremely short — perhaps too short to justify a $10 price tag",

            "review_text": "I've had my eye on this visual novel for a while, and after playing it, I can see why people like it. The story is told through the lens of Mamoru, who one day meets Sachi, a pupil who is regularly bullied and has lost sight of her dreams. When Mamoru first contacts her, she is very shy towards him. However, they end up seeing eye-to-eye on many things, and their relationship is magnified as a result.  Since this is a kinetic VN, most of the story is told through one point of view, and the exploration of themes is a bit near-sighted because of its short length, but for what it's worth, this is a pretty decent feel-good game that doesn't lose focus on its artistic vision. Because of that, I can turn a blind eye on its faults and recommend it.",

Music is pretty average, but if you take the time to go through the extras you'll know why, this game was made in under two months, which makes me love it even more actually. Art style is absolutely amazing, fell in love with it at first sight, heh. The story itself is also very well written, it feels rushed at times, and I wish I could've seen more of Mayumi-chan and Rui, but I guess that's what happens when you have a very short time limit for making a VN. I give Love at First Sight a 9/10. If you have $10 laying around and want to read a heart warming, cute story, you cannot go wrong with this. A must buy for anyone that like VNs.",

There's only one path to take, you have no conversation options and it's basically just a pimped out graphic novel for you to click through. The story is a bit lackluster and 'typical' as far as &lt;insert yourself here&gt; VN's go.   Even after all these faults, why do I recommend this game? Because I learned a lot about the process and how this game came to be via the bonus content that you unlock after finishing the game and I have a lot of respect for the creator and how he handled his situation. This is basically a one-man-show and he created it in the shortest time period. Mad props. Also: The art style resonates with me. It's creepy-adorable and I kind of want to see a full color graphic novel type manga from this creator.   PS: I'm glad the creator specified in the bonus content that he has a fetish for feeding and scar touching. If you find those things a bit odd, some scenes might make you a bit uncomfortable. I got a bit weirded out but hey, who am I to judge. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)",

The story is a really cute romance, with a nice, 'creepy-cute' style, and some weird romantic parts thrown in to match that, but it's very enjoyable. There's nothing ecchi, so people won't think you're a pervert for liking an anime cyclops. Sachi is, of course, really cute. Play the game for her. &lt;3  It's pretty short and progresses quickly, which could be seen as a con, but I like that. I can play a little bit at a time before bed and not take weeks.  The protagonist is a lot more relatable to me than other games' characters, so it's easy to read without jarring interuptions of unnatural dialogue and unnecessary narration, beside just being a dense tool. Seriously, Mamoru (lit. 'to protect') is a very nice guy. I'd be friends with him.  Having both English and Japanese options is really great. I'm going to use it to practice my Japanese in a fun way.",

The fetishes that are very clearly displayed, didn't feel intrusive and were overall cute and endearing, if you're okay with a scar, feeding others your own food, and your girl getting punched (there is no actual scene of her getting punched but it was in dialog and it wasn't in a sexual way either) fetishes then this will be just fine for you too as it was for me.  Now onto what it's about. You're just some dude who meets this cyclops girl and she's cute and you fell in love with her at first sight of course, if you can't tell that from the name and pictures then you must be some kind of airhead, like a certain character from this game.  Now the flaws. 1. The music can be pretty bad at times though intentionally, I know this will be annoying to others but I was fine with it since I knew it was trying to portray a sort of off kilter and creepy (not scary creepy) vibe.  2. The little cinemas where they tell you what act you're on are tween animated (look it up) though it's not too bad at times, at other times it makes me want to die a little since it's kinda cringy.  3. No choices, this really sucked since I wanted a route without the fetish parts so the ending would have them be less close (Neutral end), a route where you'd abuse her yourself (bad end), or even a route where she's a masochist and you're a sadist or something (true end perhaps) since she did seem like the masochist type.   Overall I loved it and it tugged on my weeaboo heart strings but it's only worth it if it's under six dollars. ",

Whilst this is a pretty good visual novel, there's also some better stuff out there, such as katawa shoujo, which features 5 girls with 5 routes, has around 10 hours or so of story. and its freaking free. which just makes justifying buying love at first sight almost impossible. if you're a fan of visual novels and have some left over cash, wait for a sale and by this, overwise stay away.",

This short visual novel describes a slice of life scenario where a young man, Mamoru, falls in love with the moderately-bruised Sachi, who only longs to have a smile worthy of the name her parents gave her (sorry Grisaia!) There really is nothing that stands out too much in this VN: Boy falls in love with girl, girl reciprocates, they date, she meets his friends, he meets her relative, girl learns to stand up for herself... everything here is something anyone over 15-18 has already seen or experienced, whether first hand experience or through an entertainment medium.   The story doesn't overstay its welcome, though it'd have been worthwhile if we could have had more unique scenarios. Backgrounds are heavily reused, there aren't a lot of variety to sprites, characters are not voiced. BUT despite these flaws (if you would call them that), the entire story is a warm, feel-good experience. Characters have well-defined, one-dimensionsal personalities, but Sachi especially exhibits some growth, which is nice to see. Though initially weak and spineless, Sachi is likeable and it's fun seeing her mature overly the course of the story. Sachi's eye is initially viewed as something to be embarassed about, but Mamoru is not repulsed, or even attracted, by this unique aspect. The eye isn't a big problem; very little about the story would be changed even if Sachi had two eyes. It differentiates Sachi but doesn't define her. -------&gt; [Good moral to glean]  To sum it up, the story/art is pretty generic, but it'll make you feel good inside. It's worth a read or two.   I'd recommend this to anyone with a few hours to kill, or as an intro to a VN rookie.",

Pros:  Amazing art, the style simply is gorgeous, and the small cutscenes are wonderfully handled Interesting story and characters, every character feels like an actual person with consistent behaviours  Cons  Feels like there are elements of the story that may be missing Ending is not quite complete (Definitive, but those looking for an ending that ties up all loose ends may be disappointed).
