I've also finished the game and there are no substantial issues with the game, or any real changes outside of the fact that the stealth sections have paths on the minimap showing you where to go now in order to make them easier. The game's last moments still leave a bit to be desired, but the majority of the story is good enough that I would definitely recommend this.  As a word of warning, at the moment this game seems to save your game based on your steam name. What this means is that changing your name causes the game to forget where your save is, and if you have any quotation marks, question marks, or any punctuation that isn't allowed in a windows folder name, the game just freezes after you choose your language at the start.  I haven't played the game past the opening yet, but I finished the original Indigo Prophecy and the original Fahrenheit release from GOG and assuming they haven't broke anything it's a great game aside from the ending so I'll leave the recommendation at a yes anyways.",

Cool set of characters, a nice setting, mystery, good music and everything else you would want from this kind of adventure game. And while the gameplay is old (controlling the characters is a pain), the story is what drives you to keep playing this game. But from about 1/3 of the game, everything goes downfall. The game turns into some kind of cheap action movie, the plot becomes absurd and you won't believe in your eyes. Did I smoke something?  Indigo Prophecy is one of those games I just can't explain, you have to play by yourself. But be aware of the hours and hours of QTE and Dragon Ball-esque scenes on your face.  Why do I recommend?

            "review_text": "Developer Quantic Dream, makers of Heavy Rain and Beyond: Two Souls, made this gem too, if you played any of those before then you will know what to expect here. if you haven't then beware, this isn't the regular type of action game you know. it is more like an interactive movie where you have to make choices and do some QTE (kinda like Telltale games) to progress. I found this to be an immersive supernatural thriller, introducing Quantic Dream's unique brand of 'interactive movie' gameplay that they do so well.  There's an overall cinematic feel to Fahrenheit that lends a unique atmosphere to the presentation. This is evident from the very beginning, which is probably one of the best opening scenes (not better than Silent Hill 2 though). - regarding the story (no spoilers), it's a psychological thriller that, as it progresses, takes on more and more over-the-top supernatural elements. I think many would be turned off by the far-fetched twists and turns that the plot takes, but I really liked it and was hooked till the end. - Gameplay is a mixture of moving around like the known adventure games, look around for stuff to interact with and doing many QTE (Quick Time Events) which kinda looks like the old toy (Simon) where you have to follow the lights sequences and push the buttons in the direction of the lights. also, it has the 'choose your own adventure' style of dialogue (several conversation options at select points (you're asked to pick one quickly to determine where it goes from there). sometimes if you fail you will die and have to restart the sequence.  - The graphics of course looks really dated (kinda similar to Max Payne graphics). while it isn't the remaster i was hoping for it is still better than the original and much better than the PS2 version. the price is fair i think. i even saw the option to play it at 4K but my screen is only 1080p so i went with that. but no matter what resolution you use the textures aren't gonna improve much, I highly recommend playing it with a controller (Xbox 360 or xbox1 controllers works perfectly).  - I really have huge respect for Quantic Dream, they took big risks in making this and their later games in a way that won't appeal to everyone and won't sell like other AAA games but are great and unique none the less.   - The port ran fine for me so far except one scene in the office where all characters vanished and i was just hearing voices then the game froze and crashed, other than that one instance eveything went fine and dandy.  - Small note to the developer, it would be better if i could highlight the resolution i want then click apply than having the screen flashing on me while scrolling through resolution options.",

            "review_text": "Fahrenheit garnered critical acclaim when it first came out 10 years ago: its QTE events and story were something seldom seen before and more than made up for its shortcomings. Nowadays its innovation is lost of course, and the game hasn't aged well but it is and always will be a classic.   PROS:   -a good cast of characters,all fairly interesting  -a compelling story, the beginning is especially very strong and makes you want to know what's happenening  -the various game scenes feature a nice amount of variety  -great soundtrack  -good voice acting  -nice cinematic cameras in certain scenes   CONS:   -story starts to become a bit too surreal towards the end, several different elements also seem to have been introduced just to try and make the mistery more complex  -the over reliance on QTEs is more distracting or annoying than anything else, some QTEs are also too drawn out for their own good or require inputs way too quickly  -having a limited number of retries for each QTes is annoying and feels out of place in a game like this one  -despite the HD treatment the game clearly shows its age with bland textures, fairly simple models and low res effects  -somewhat sluggish controls paired with a camera view that can sometimes get in the way  -wooden animations  -certain character interactions feel too sudden and forced just to further the plot  - a few glaring elements left in the release really made me wonder, examples are a stretched texture on one of the main char's face (in a couple of levels only, luckily), the game client quickly dropping back to windows to refresh itself when loading a level and no dpad support         Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered&nbsp;",

Now with HD Textures -The first half of the game is tense, interesting and has a nice mystery atmosphere. - English Voice-actors are doing an awesome job - It is a very unique experience   The Bad:  - The HD Textures can look a bit out of place - In the second half/last third the game falls completely apart:  --The Story becomes an insane mess with deus ex machinas,  --Characters have information out of nowhere as if stuff was cut out,  --and a complete change of tone. The QTEs become absurdly long and all the really nice 'puzzles' from the beginning   are gone.   So what to do?  You kinda have to play this. The first half to see what you can do with David Cages Idea of Games. How interesting and working his concept is. And the second half you just have to see. It's fascinating to watch something become so absolutely stupid and over the top. It's 'bad sonic fan-fiction' absurd. it's like if 'Se7en' would have ended with a big DBZ Style fight between the main characters and 2 more characters who just came up in the last 5 minutes.  So buy it, enjoy the first half of the game and laugh at the second half.  And for the germans here who want to play it in german: DO NOT DO IT! The german voice-over is horrible.

It's a choice-based game similar to Heavy Rain about a man who is somehow possessed and trying to find some answers regarding his situation. You get to play as him (Lucas) and two detectives Carla and Tyler who investigate this 'bizarre' (inside joke) murder. The story is very interesting and I don't think you'll find yourself bored at any point, the remastered graphics are not very good but they are okay and not a total pain for the eyes and the gameplay, well, that might be the only negative thing about the game. First of all, the controls are clunky, you might have some hard time getting used to movement in this game while the camera angle suddenly changes so you press the wrong key. The other possibly frustrating thing is the ♥♥♥♥ ton of quicktime events. There has to be some in a game like this but I thought they were sometimes in very unnecessary situations. However, these cons can be ignored considering the remaining parts of the game are plain awesome. It's a must-play.",

This Steam version is the unedited and remastered version of the game, which looks nicely polished. The original Indigo Prophecy had a grainy look to it. I suppose that they foolishly added this to the game to give it a movie feel; that grainy look is gone in this Steam version, thankfully.  This game is an interactive movie with a great soundtrack, and a well written storyline. This game is almost perfect! My only slight complaint with the game is that some scenes have fixed camera positions, which can be awkward, while other scenes in this game allow a full 360 degree motion with the camera. I would have liked to see them allow the full 360 degree motion with the camera in all of the scenes, but it didn't happen. All in all, I HIGHLY recommend this game.",

Multi camers and viewports  - easy to find the destination.  - just looks cool to see a several view points at the same time in one screen.  - Displaying an enemy character in the auxiliary view port was very thirilling when the character need to do something before the enemy catches him.  2. Mood  - I felt emotions like fear(basement of police station and mental hospital), excitement(while fighting with Oracle and avoiding police) and embarrassment(when something fall apart).  - Music is really helping it.  3. Graphical effects  - I liked flashback, shocked screen(burning white) and ghost view fullscreen effects.  - Magnifying glass and snow effects was also interesting.  4. Excellent voice acting.  Something wanting.   1. eight arrows in the center of screen.  - these arrows sometimes annoying me and I couldn't focus on the actual scene because of it. I wanted to give my eye focus to the action animations in the actual scene but I coudn't.  2. Polygon count and animations are not remastered. Only textures are magnified.

I'm playing with a PS3-controller through a tool that makes my system think it's a 360-controller, and it works flawlessly. All in all, this is a great game, especially considering how old it is.

The masters of strange, interactive games that are presented as movies.  I really enjoyed Heavy Rain and to a lesser degree Beyond 2 souls. I did not know that they had done this game before to the PS2/PC before I saw it on GOG.   This is a 'remastered' and uncut version of Fahrenheit.  A strange interactive movie where you control almost all characters by walking around, branching dialog and quicktime events. The remastered graphics are nowhere to be seen but its acceptable for a good looking 2004 year game. The soundtrack is really varied, but maybe a bit stereotypic.   The camera and controls are horrific. The clues for the quicktime events blend into the background so its hard to see what to do. Often there are no instant kill, but the miss system is not as elegant as for say Heavy Rain or A wolf amongst us.   Some of the voice acting is really horrible. The actors also overact all the time, swinging their heads back and forth when they talk. The audio is badly compressed, captured from a time when it was standard to have bad quality on voice because of how much space audio takes. (sad that the master tapes did not have full quality samples since it today would be no problem releasing with full quality voice samples)  So why recommend this game?  This is a classic games. Telltale games are clearly inspired from Quantic Dreams. I hope that many buys this game so we can get a PC conversion of Heavy Rain that was a great interative movie.  The story, using camera techniques, some of the adult themes are all a breath of fresh air even in todays gaming.   I do however hate Steam/publishers localized pricing system. I have always thought it was because of taxes (for example EU where some countries have 25% VAT). But no: Its just location based. I have 2 steam accounts. 1 in asia and 1 in EU. This game is about 100% more expensive in EU. Wait for a sale in EU. The publishers have released the game cheaper elsewhere, they can afford to sell this on a sale.",

Models are low-poly and shadows and dynamic lighting are highly selective.  However, the atmosphere and feel are still there. The game still works VERY well. And with 1080p support and antialiasing and anisotrophy etc, and with GREAT 360 gamepad support (mimicking the old X-box controls - trust me, they're integral to the experience and feel very organic even in the QTE's) this version is definitely worth a purchase.  As others have mentioned, though -- the final act of the game is a bit... weird. I've heard rumors this was supposed to be much longer, or possibly a trilogy of games. And they had to squeeze in a lot of story content into that third act. That pretty much sums up how it feels -- like they took all the big 'revbeal' moments of two more games, removed everything between those moments, and stuck them after eachother. So now, the end part of the game isn't that great. Still worth a playthrough, though.",

And I believe because of that + the lack of a good logic (like on 'Heavy Rain') made the game a little frustrating. For example: On Heavy Rain, your choices affect other chapters, while on Fahrenheit, your choices barely affect something on the future. It affects more your mood instead of consequences.  The story is really great, it's really creative, but I heard that David Cage (director of Q.D.) had to rush the game I guess, and that's why from the middle until the end, the story ♥♥♥♥s logic and it's full of plot holes.  For example: Why would a catholic priest not believe on supernatural stuff??? If you ask a catholic priest for help because of 'supernatural stuff' happened to you, this priest would at least offer himself to pray you or your house. (jeez, wake up, David Cage!)  There are so many plot holes that even a SECOND villian appears. This second villain is so USELESS to the story that I have no idea why David Cage invented it in the first place. And there's something that really frustrated me. There are two moments in this game that it's up to you the 'future' of two characters. But it doesn't matter of what you choose! If you keep them alive, safe or with you, these two characters DISAPPEAR from the story. And you have no idea where they are even if you save their lives. This is a HUGE mistake commited by David Cage.   Another weird thing in this game it's the MAIN COUPLE. It makes NO SENSE.  Jeez, David Cage... Again, where were your mind when you choose the main couple? You see, there are two couples that totally match each other. And then David just put two different characters that have no reason to stay together to have chemistry with each other OUT OF THE BLUE.    If Carla should end with someone, it should be with Tyler! Seriously, Carla is a serious, workaholic cop. She's not the romantic type to dive her mind on a nonsense relationship during some sort of apocalypse    But then again, on Heavy Rain, David Cage committed the same mistake by making two different people stay together in a horrible moment to have romance.  Although you can be frustrated with so many plot holes or the lack of 'consequences' in this game, it's really nice. It has a creative story that makes you want to know more. I guess Fahrenheit could be the 'sketch' Quantic Dream had to make so they could get it right on their next interactive drama game.  It has some weird primitive QTEs too.  But the soundtrack is really awesome and totally fits with each character.  I hope Quantic Dream could REMAKE this game and remove some useless crap I mentioned above and fill the plot holes, because this story is worthy!",

I'd recommend it for sure if you see it on sale and you had a good time playing Heavy Rain, B:TS, or anything similar to that.

            "review_text": "Fun fact: I played this game way back in the day when it originally came out on the PS2. Back then I knew it as “Indigo Prophecy”, and my teenage self was intrigued by its emphasis on cinematics and interactive storytelling, so I rented it for a weekend. I didn’t finish it during that rental period, and needless to say, I didn’t rent it a second time. The game’s story was just too weird. I think it was about the time that the main character began developing superpowers that I decided to let Blockbuster keep this one. So, ten years later and here I am playing this game again. Ten years older, ten years wiser… I’ve aged pretty well. Can the same be said for Fahrenheit?  The game gets off to a bad start when I’m greeted by French menus. This isn’t a big deal, but it’s a weird, lazy oversight, and it sets the tone for what’s to come. It’s especially weird considering this is supposed to be the “definitive” remastered edition of the game, but it just ends up feeling like a lazy port of a previous PC release. It does feature some updated textures for the new HD resolutions, but I honestly could barely tell any difference. Also, in another weird, lazy oversight, the game mode that features HD textures is actually the one with the old, low-res text and menus. I don’t know how the developers in charge of the port messed that one up. Anyway, after switching to English, I’m quickly reminded of director David Cage’s quest to create “interactive film” when, instead of “New Game” being an option on the main menu, there’s instead the option for “New Movie”. This, coupled with the game’s tutorial consisting of an in-game, low-poly version of Cage himself in a virtual movie set “directing” me, the player, through the game’s controls and promising a world where “anything can happen” creates an annoyingly pretentious vibe. Why must Cage remind me at every turn that this is an interactive movie? Can’t the product just speak for itself? Shouldn’t a game, or an interactive story, or whatever you choose to call it stand on its own as an experience instead of relying on the strengths of another medium?  I have to admit that I do like the game’s engine and core gameplay, though. Quantic Dream came up with a pretty good control scheme and game mechanics for a title focused on storytelling. Interacting with the environment and selecting dialogue choices is all done with the right stick or the mouse pointer, which is both intuitive and immersive. Holding left to slide open a closet door to the left, for instance, feels natural, and actions that require holding a direction longer, like turning on a light, do a good job of putting the player in the character’s shoes. It’s simple, but it works. With this engine you could conceivably tell any film-like story interactively, with quick-time events provided for action sequences or scenes in which characters must exert themselves physically. The characters are also all well-animated due to extensive motion capture, and are generally well-voice acted. David Gasman in particular gives a grounded, believable performance as main character Lucas, which is actually saying a lot given the ridiculous material.  That’s really where the problem lies. Despite the game functioning fairly well and providing a good system for telling an interactive story, the story itself is, ironically, the game’s downfall. It’s just poorly conceived. Cage is ok with dialogue and basic character emotions and relationships, but for some reason he isn’t content with just telling character driven stories. Fahrenheit is full of supernatural nonsense that only serves to alienate the player from any connection they might have felt to the characters. Full disclosure: I still haven’t finished the game, even after writing this review. I honestly can’t bring myself to; it’s such an unenjoyable experience. As a kid I stopped when Lucas developed superpowers; this time I couldn’t make it past the giant termites. I wish I were making that sentence up. Every now and then I will indeed feel as though I’m in the shoes of a character, making dramatic decisions with consequence in the film of their lives. I like the scene where Lucas’s estranged brother Markus gives him a call. It’s legitimately dramatic and interesting, and then it’s immediately ruined when Lucas tries to explain that he only committed a murder because of some magic mumbo jumbo. I instantly stopped caring. The vast majority of the time spent playing Fahrenheit feels like this; it feels like playing a stupid video game. A poorly written one that takes itself too seriously and comes across as pretentious for it. I find this quote from Cage extremely ironic and extremely telling:  “During development, I discovered that this everyday facet of the characters was in fact the most interesting aspect of the game—much more than the supernatural side.”  Why couldn’t the game have just been full of moments like this, like the phone call between brothers who haven’t seen each other in years? Simple, relatable moments between real people with real problems.  Because of this I can’t really recommend Fahrenheit, even to fans of the adventure genre, except as maybe a historical curiosity. In the end, Fahrenheit is an admittedly ambitious, but extremely flawed and ultimately unenjoyable experience. It is interesting to see some of the strides it made, and its lineage can indeed be seen in modern adventure games like The Walking Dead, but in a genre that’s all about storytelling, and with a story as uneven and poorly-executed as this one, you may as well just watch a real movie instead of this cheap virtual knock-off. Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered is the pretentious poeticals of a college freshman.",

Everything feels subpar and cliché. The writing, the acting, the atmosphere and, of course, the gameplay. It's really obvious in this one that David Cage lacked talent to actually come up with moving ideas and just borrowed instead a lot from mainstream movies. Over the years, he got somewhat better, but you can see that many of the weaknesses in Indigo Prophecy got still carried along the way, making Quantic Dreams games rather average for seasoned gamers or cinephiles, compared to so many games out there, especially indie ones.  Anyway, I thought I'd still managed to pull through despite all these flaws, but the horrendous controls/camera and terrible gameplay really broke the deal for me. Immersion is often broken, because any action or movement can feel like a struggle and I'm not even talking about the beyond ridiculous action sequences base on a double 'Simon Says' game, which, as many have reported, distracts you from what is actually going on on the screen.

The quick-time events are excessive, repetitive, lacking of any sort of substance due to the absolute lack of player choice or any skill in general beyond a low reaction time. This is worsened by the repeated use of very long sequences of quick-time events without any intermediate checkpoints or the like (the flying-objects sequence in Lucas' apartment comes to mind) which ultimately lead to frustration over repeated failures which the player can do nothing to avoid except mindlessly retrying and hoping to randomly be a little faster or a little more accurate on the next try. Lastly, the puzzles are trivial and feel like those of a point-and-click, rewarding brute experimentation more than reflection on mechanics and comparison against previous puzzles, perhaps due to a high dependency on puzzle-specific rather than systemic mechanics. On top of that, many puzzles (e.g. the bookshop/library) and quick-time events (e.g. boxing, basketball practice) are mostly unrelated to the main plot and feel unsubstantial and redundant. All in all, this game would have been a lot more enjoyable as a movie. At the very least it should have been stripped of all the shallow quick-time events and received some adjustments to controls and camera behavior.
