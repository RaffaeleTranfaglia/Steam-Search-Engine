Combine that with amazing music and a wide variety of visual layouts and you have one little fun-filled package. The game is on the short side since you can unlock all achievements and modes in an hour, but just like the original pacman, you can play this in short bursts for as long as you want.",

            "review_text": "The original video gaming mascot is back in his best game since the 1980s. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ takes Pac back to his roots with single screen arcade levels. The controls are simple, up, left, down and right to make Pac-Man move through different labyrinths, eating pellets and dodging ghosts. When Pac-Man eats a power pellet, the hunters become the hunted and Pac-Man will eat the ghosts to death! Think about that logic!  But that's how the classic game played, and while there isn't much difference between then and now, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ has different 'challenges' that you select and play. Mostly time trials that have you eating enough fruit to complete the objective after eating enough pellets to make the fruit appear. You'll also have score attacks that put you in a level for 5 or 10 minutes to get the highest score you can. There is even a ghost chain mode that will have you seeing how many ghosts you can eat before a power pellet wears off. Each challenge needs to be unlocked and for the most part they're all easy, but a lot of quick fun.  The game now has 'inactive' ghosts that stand in gaps. They don't move, they're just there, until Pac-Man sets them off, but they don't just chase him. Instead they wait for another ghost to float by and then join a ghost chain. These chains get longer and longer as a sort of centipede. Its visually impressive and adds a new dynamic of just having a long string of enemies to avoid. When you get a power pellet, it feels satisfying to eat fifty ghosts. These ghosts can also have pellets and power pellets in them, so to advance through the game, you need to eat the ghosts. It is a nice twist.  That's not the only twist, you don't clear an entire level like the original Pac-Man. The game makes lines of pellets after you eat each fruit. It might seem easy to just follow the lines, but the challenge comes from Pac-Man moving so fast and ghosts being everywhere. The maps will even get altered to block out paths or make new paths. With every complete line you eat, a piece of fruit will appear along with the next line and more 'inactive' ghosts. So it feels like there is always something changing and happening. Even the level changes colors.   Each of the game's 10 or so unlockable levels are a vibrant array of neon colors, but before you start each challenge, you can change each level's look. From old school pixelated Pac-Man to new school and even the lego block look from previous games. You can change the sprites too. Its a nice dynamic that can keep the game looking fresh. There is also plenty of DLC to buy that changes sprites and level graphics. The background music sounds great and the fast paced beat matches the arcade action.  There is even a new gameplay mechanic of ghost clearing bombs. When you use a bomb it sends all active ghosts to their penalty box in the middle of the screen. These bombs are helpful when you get pinched by two ghosts, but to to some people bombs might feel like cheating even if they decrease your scoring rate temporarily.  The game is fast paced. Eating ghosts will make the game go faster. Higher difficulties will make the game start out faster. It creates a need for fast paced reflexes, while still being forgiving, because if you are headed for a ghost, the game will slow down to give you time enough to dodge it. It is very helpful and feels forgiving.  If its too easy for you, there are three difficulties, each give you fewer and fewer bombs and lives along with amping up the game speed. If you lose a life, it simply sends the active ghosts to their penalty box, but you get to continue on after a brief delay.  This is what Pac-Man should have been all along. Just upgrading and tweaking the original classic. Well worth $10 for any arcade lover, but get it at a discount, especially since the game has so much DLC to purchase.",

This does not play like the original Pac Man, where you have to eat all the dots on the stage and advance to the next. Instead, you start off with a few dots, power ups and some ghosts. When you pass by the ghosts they chase you and start making a big trail of ghosts, for the most part the ghosts stay behind you. It may sound simple, and it is, but it's also a lot of fun. It won't be long before you start seeing long chains of ghosts chasing you, and eating a power up, turning around and gobbling them all up, while you try to do random activities through the day.  Each stage has different time challenges, and you can alter the way the stage looks and how the characters look. That is a nice feature. I've keep reading people having some sort of input lag and other technical issues, and was a bit concerned. But i got the game anyway, and had no issues myself.",

            "review_text": "Last time I took Pacman for a spin was around 2004, when Pacman World 2 came out. Boy, did I regret that decision. Fixed camera angles and a difficulty that went up and down like a whack-a-mole's hammer ruined the game and I tossed it out the 3rd floor window. Funny thing is, that game came with additional versions of past Pacman games but I felt at an extreme disadvantage when it came to survival, whether you were to jump or not.  Red about this game and I realised I have been missing that drive to complete a game 100%. It either needed to be an extremely specific genre and game (Arkham Series) or something I could do in a week or so (Shadow Of Mordor). There was no feeling of replayability and a strive to perfection, like say, Wipeout HD. I now know that I am starving for arcade games like Burnout and this one.  A constant need to get better at this is ever present due to the ranking method. I have only completed Championship II with an S ranking and this has taken me a considerable time. It is extremely addictive to figure out the nooks and crannies of every course and trying to maximize your score by eating up a long chain of ghosts is the best way of saying ♥♥♥♥ you to these guys. It is revenge, pure and simple but as sweet as it is, it also has to be planned out. The patterns of the dots and the fruits appearing is something that has to be memorized for successful progression, not to mention that the game speeds up to ridiculous proportions. And if you get stuck, try watching someone else's replay, it's always helpful.  It's arcade, it's addictive for perfectionists and colorful as hell, something that's been missing from today's market. If it weren't for my army tour, I would have clocked 50+ hours already cause I am dying to finish this and get me GW: Dimensions.",

After playing a few more challenges I realized that this is one of the easiest games I've ever played (next to maybe Plants Vs. Zombies). The patterns Pac-Man follows are the same every time, the levels offer little variety, and there are so many extra lives and bombs (which essentially wipe out any ghosts chasing you) that I've never run out of either.

I was skeptical that anything could trump the tried-and-true formula of the original arcade classics, but this not only destroyed my expectations, it took those little bits and arranged them in a giant 'TOLD U SO' on the floor. PMCEDX+ takes the original game you love and makes it faster, more colorful, more powerful, and more varied than the original game.  The relative concept is simple; collect different patterns of dots while avoiding sleeping ghosts. Each half of a room you clear opens up the other half, and the ghosts you awaken form a raging conga line behind you. While nabbing a power pellet in the original games was fun enough, this game steps that up, allowing you to devour hordes of ghosts and turn that raging conga line into nothing. All this to fast-paced electronic music and colorful, abstract stages. PMCEDX+ is a game that knows how to make your palms sweat and make you breathe a sigh of relief after beating a tough level. It can be difficult, but it never feels frustrating.  I guess if there's anything to knock about this game, it's that it feels a bit shorter than it should be. The game has lots of challenges and maps for you, but they seem to be over pretty quickly. Despite this, the levels are a plast to play over and over. It's a game where you feel like everything is about to come off the rails at any second, and you're just barely holding on, and it's pure bliss. Plus, this is an easy game to get all the achievements in. If you miss the arcade flair of the original games or just want something to benchmark your twitch reflexes, then PMCEDX+ is the perfect game for you.",

As you eat pellets the ghosts you pass by on the map start to follow you, so the goal is to have as many ghosts following you as possible so you can gobble them all up the second you get a power pellet. The visuals and music are fantastic, and figuring out the best way to navigate through all the patterns to get the best score is immensely satisfying.  One thing I'll say is that if you're going to get this game, I HIGHLY recommend getting the All You Can Eat edition instead of just the base game. The new maps have some neat patterns that put some interesting spins on the formula, the two new music tracks (PAC-STEP and REENTRANCE) are fantastic, and the DigDug/Rally-X skins are cute bonuses.

You might think, 'What can they do to change pac man?' but after you play this you'll almost definitely agree its an improvement. It is much more intense and frantic, simple yet stylish graphics and effects, that feeling you get with an army of ghosts right on your tail, it's a lot of fun, and a refreshing change from your typical linear action game to be focused on beating the high score rather than just beating the game.  I only have two bad things I can say about it - both are minor - and that's that there is no endless mode; the original Pac-man technically went on forever if you were good enough; but in Championship edition DX+ all modes have a time limit. The other problem is that the Touch/Mouse UI is always on screen and partially blocks your view of the maze, even if you're using the keyboard or a gamepad. An option to turn this interface off would be greatly appriciated.  Other thoughts: There are some significant changes from normal pac-man, most notably the slow-mo when you're about to run into a ghost, and the bombs which knock ghosts out of the way. At first, it may seem like this dumbs the game down, but it really doesn't. The slow mo effect is helpful, but it's really just a cool thing- its very styleized and it doesn't save you when you're truly doomed. Bombs can save you, but you have a limited number so it creates a strategy element. This game is more challenging than it looks.",

            "review_text": "Pac-Man was the first game I EVER played. My parents used to tell me I was only three years old. Of course, I have no idea how true that really is.. but I do have one very old memory of playing the game on the Commodore64. That being said, it's a true classic. I still love that old game to this very day... but this isn't a review of the original game, is it?  I had to give that brief history lesson, because the sheer amounts of nostalgia I feel while playing this version is almost overwhelming.. yet, at the same time, it also feels amazingly fresh. The first time you gobble down a long string of ghosts, you'll have the biggest grin and probably not even realize it. Why? Because that huge speed increase caught you off guard.. so you'll remember that instead.  The goal is still to get as many points as possible, only now it's done with a time limit. Mazes are divided in two, and clearing one half of dots will place a fruit on the other half. Eating the fruit will cause more dots to appear on the empty half while also altering the maze layout on that half as well. The dot patterns also often contain green sleeping ghosts. Getting close will wake them and they'll immidiately give chase, becoming rainbow colored in the process (their color constantly shifts and changes). Gathering large strings of these ghosts is a primary method of scoring points when you come across a power pellet. Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde are also present and act much like they used to before. Getting too close will also make these guys angry and they can join the train. If so, their eyes will pop back into ghost house to reappear. As such.. Blinky will add quite a bit to the train just because he's the chaser, and the angry ghost train is that on crack anyway. Clyde ends up being a bit dangerous thanks to his somewhat random nature when combined with the train following you and the overall speed of the game. Pinky and Inky are also dangerous in their own regards, just not as much. &lt;3 Inky  The music also must be stated. Whoever it is who made these tracks deserves more credit than they probably got. There is absolutely no way you'd be able to take your eyes off the action to glance up at a timer at the higher speeds. The closer the timer is to running out, the more intrusive the music gets compared to the sound effects of the game itself.. and it builds up to a climax as the timer runs out. The brilliance behind that cannot go without being mentioned.  This game, man. It's an updated take on a legend, and it's done perfectly. A 'classic' mode would have been icing on the cake.. but whatever. If you're a fan of Pac-Man, you're doing yourself a huge disservice by not AT LEAST trying out the demo.  EDIT Sept. 16, 2015: So having unlocked the 'classic' skin and giving it a go... I feel let down by it, honestly. Keep in mind that Pac-Man is a game I loved since a VERY young age. But anyway... to nitpick the 'classic' skin if I may, and I certainly may... ..The colors on the sleeping/angry ghosts are horribly muted. I know they didn't exist in the old game, but still. They just look bad. All of the other 'characters' are bright and colorful, but these look drab and boring. ..Inky isn't cyan. For the non-classic skins this is fine. But for the 'classic' skin, why isn't he cyan? ..The ghosts have black eyes. I'm fine with this in regards to the angry ghost chain, but why do the four main ghosts not have blue eyes? ..The normal 'pac-dots' are round. In the original game, circles weren't invented yet. The dots were small squares. In this regard, and for the eye color of the ghosts, the Type A skin does a better job than the classic skin does!  I dunno. The classic skin does some things right, but I just can't get over the nitpicks. It completely fails at being 'classic'. But I can't change my recommendation on that alone.. nobody can. It's still a fantastic game. ...I just won't be using the classic skin all that much. :)",

You're still eating dots and avoiding ghosts like usual. What is new is now the stages change without interrupting gameplay and you find sleeping ghosts sprinkled seemingly randomly around the level. Also, the scoring emphasizes finding the fastest route around the maze and leading a train of ghosts behind you until you manage to find a powerpill and score lots of points for clearing the ghosts.  Playing is genuinely fun in small doses and you can compare your scores alongside with your Steam-friendlist and all the players globally. On the other hand this 'social integration' has gone downright ugly considering several of the achievements require you to announce some of other miniscule accomplishements in the Facebook! You want the retro Pac-Man visuals? Then you need to share over a dozen of varying achievements which gets embarrasing really; most of them aren't even any real feats, they'll just end up cluttering your FB profile. How awkward.  Which leads to the final verdict: Would I recommend this game? Yes, unless you for some reason have always hated Pac-Man. The actual gameplay underneath the needless bloat is fun and you might even appreciate the techno soundtrack. There are ample customization over the visuals and style (some of them are DLC) and a few different game modes. You won't 100% clear this game in a couple of days. There's a demo available so give it a go. I'd say it gives you the very best impression of the game and does it's best to leave you hungry for more. The Facebook integration might be (or not) a negative factor to you but I'd rather not give a damn about it.",

Getting revenge on the ghosts in one of the game mods is priceless, and trying to react fast enough at max-speed keeps my reflexes good! The varying mazes and game-modes make this Pac-Man game well worth it, for new fans or old. I recommend giving it a try, you won't be disappointed I promise!

The ability to use alternate designs from other Pac-Man titles such as Pac-Mania, and even offering DLC that includes skins based on other games such as Dig Dug and Rally X makes this game as entertaining as eye candy as it does in gameplay. The additions of the game that include slow-mo effects to help avoid ghosts, bombs that can help you from getting trapped between two ghosts, and the auto-adjusting of the speed of play based on deaths and bomb-use are excellent additions that make the game a lot more interesting and lowers the chances of a reallly cheap death.  My only concern is that there is no Classic Mode option that only involves the title character the four main ghosts, and the classic gameplay of the original game. And while there are plenty of modes to choose from, this game isn't going to keep you busy for very long if you don't buy the DLC. But other than that, any fan of the arcade classic this was based on is sure to enjoy this blast from the past.  9.2/10",

On the first day, with in 7 mins of play, I knew I had to have it.   So, you want classic arcade action? This game is the epitome of classic arcade action and everything about this game is designed wonderfully to keep that going. It's got an updated fresh new design but still has that classic flavor. It's easy to pick up and play, because it's Pac-Man, just eat the dots and avoid the ghosts. Then eat the big dots and eat the ghosts. Simple!!! ...all you may need to 'play just one more game' just one more time, and because of how well the arcade action is designed, you will find yourself coming back to this game, time and time again trying to top that high score.

During no time over the course of this review were virtual ghosts hurt or abused in any way. If someone you know is abusing ghosts, speak up and say something. It's never too late. And now, onto the review...  If you're a living, breathing, actual human being over the age of ten, then most likely you've played 'Pac-Man' at one time or another. Growing up I would play at local arcades and pizzerias whenever I got the chance, but I never really cared all that much about the game. That is until I picked this one up during the 2014 Summer Sale. Now all I have to say is that 'Pac-Man' is highly addictive! Sure, the levels all look relatively similar, and all you're really doing is running around collecting dots and eating frantic ghosts, but as I said before; this game is insanely addictive.  And if you're thinking to yourself that you've already seen everything 'Pac-Man' has to offer, then think again. Because this is not the same game that came out all those decades ago. That's right, 'Pac-Man' has been updated with new rules, game modes, stimulating colors, and best of all: competitive online score keeping. So now you and your friends can post your high scores for all to enjoy! But seriously, if you aren't familiar with 'Pac-Man', consider picking this one up. You really can't beat it.",

DId you spend most of your quarters and trade in your cash for tokens because you were obsessed with Pac-Man, Dig Dug, Centipede, and other 80's greats? If so, you're a child of the 80's and you most likely also had a Rubik's Cube that you may or may not have figured out, and may have been a Pac-Aholic. If so, Pac-Man Championship Edition DX+ is for you. No, it doesn't look or play exactly like the original classic but it still maintains the same magic as the original, this could be due to the developer of the original supposedly having a role in making the game. Pac-Man Championship Edition DX, which I'll refer to as PMCE from here on out, has Pac-Man gobling pellets, running from or chasing after Inky and the other ghosts, and trying to score big (no, not with Ms. Pac-Man, this is a game for all ages).   If one gets all of the DLC content for the game there's even more 80's nostalgic fun to be had since they added Dig Dug and Rally X skins to the game so you can play as Dig Dug or a little racing car. And all the sound effects and background music, its also a lovely flashback to the 80's, a highly entertaining decade (sure, the PMRC tried to poop on the party but Twisted Sister and others pooped on them instead). In short, PCME is a lovely flashback to the 80's and highly recommended to children of the 80's who loved the original, or younger people who are obsessed with all things 80's.  For you keyboard and mouse junkies, the keyboard and mouse control in the game seem to work fine but I find it far more pleasing to play it using a gamepad. But well, different strokes for different folks.",

I got it in the Namco Humble Bundle, and installed it because I felt like I was going to need something simple to play between rage sessions in Dark Souls. I was fully ready for the same stale Pac-Man experience they've been rehashing to 80's kids since the 90's. I was ready for the same stages, with the same music, and the exact same gameplay.  Well I was just wrong. I'm sorry, Namco.  This game is what Pac-Man would be like if Pac-Man did a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of coke and threw on some EDM. Following lines of dots wakes up nearby sleeping ghosts, causing them to chase you in a massive line, adding the classic 'Snake' gameplay of 'don't run into your own tail' to the difficulty. As the stage goes on, it gets faster and faster, and it's honestly just out-of-control fun. Picking up a Power Pellet with a train of ghosts behind me for the first time was completely insane. I never thought a Pac-Man game (of all the games I've played) would make me happily exclaim 'HAHA, WHAT' out loud.  Also, online leaderboards will keep you playing in order to be the best. 'Just one more time' is something I probably said about 20 times to hit S-Rank on more than a few courses.",

Really tests your decision-making at high speeds. Stuns with its gorgeous array of fully customizable graphics, music, and sounds.  However, with change comes a price: gameplay quickly becomes repetitive, worsened by uninspired and unnecessary level design and poor AI. Euphoria from the flashy presentation turns to rote boredom, unless you're a high-score chaser - in which case, you'll also be let down, because the leaderboards were hacked, and nothing has been done about it.  While I enjoyed my time initially, I can't recommend this for long-term fun. However, hardcore fans will be still in for a treat.",
