            "review_text": "Inquisitor is a great idea. Poorly executed. Don't get me wrong, I'm playing the game, I'm almost a dozen hours in and it's somewhat challenging, however the mechanics are poorly designed. Here's an example: you don't need the identify skill because you can cast a spell that identifies everything in your inventory. You must swap out spells from your quickslots(of which there just aren't enough) mid battle, which can be pretty annoying and can get you killed quite easily. For a game the devs spent 7+ years on(they say 2 or 3 of translations I think) they really didn't do very well. This game deserves its metascore, but you really can't go wrong for 10 USD, it's still fairly fun. It's just very gimmicky and like I said, the mechanics suck at higher levels.",

It was a bit rough at the start playing as a priest with hardly any spells and low chance to cast them successfully, but it gets much better. Use plenty of magic seal items at the start (instant magic spell items with 100% success) until your own magic abilities get better. When you get AoE spells much later in the game you will be unstoppable.  The story is very unique compared to other games I've played, and the gameplay is too. It combines investigation with regular RPG elements very well.",

I enjoyed playing the priest class, the focus on spells felt great in my opinion. The user inteface could have been better.   Story  The game has a lot of text, so you'll have to read.

            "review_text": "Oh my god It's so good. It took me like three hours to get working and it still isn't displaying correctly but it doesn't even matter.   I've played close to maybe an hour of it so far and I can say it's everything I wanted it to be. The dialogues are ripe with exposition for paragraphs on end, the tone of which is lavishly crafted to be equal parts melodramatic and faustian at once. You're introduced as a detective of sorts, sent to help the church find, accuse and try heretics. The 'bishop' type you are sent to meet tells you about the process of doing so, which I'm sure will be a ♥♥♥♥ing gloriously complicated mechanic that will provide hours of harsh entertainment.   The aesthetic of it is so pleasingly dark, not deppressingly or overwhelmingly so, but very dull green, light brown; beautiful in a dreary sort of way. It's got the feel that Diablo 2 had for me back in the day. In fact that's not a bad comparison. It's like a literary Diablo 2, taking more cues from historical events (like, say, the Inquisition) than high fantasy.   One criticism I might level at it is that tooltips could be more prevalant. I like complicated systems in my games, but I also like to know how to use them. A developer shouldnt play the game for you, but they should at least throw you an instruction manual. But that's it. Even the display issues are given a pass by me, because it's so damn cool.  I might feel compelled to change my opinion once I've played further, but as of now, I've got a thorough erection for this game.",

Then there's the combat, which while when you are at the right level is ok, it is the grindiest grindfest ever. You will spend painful hours grinding just to get to be able to walk around the next area without getting one hit killed. And not to mention the horrendous stamina mechanic.  That being said, the music is amazing. Shame it's wasted on such a letdown of a game. ",

            "review_text": "Beautifull artwork, enjoyable storyline, poorly thought-out combat design. Particularly irritating side-quest design. Example: You've talked to every named NPC in town except one. That last NPC offers a side-quest. Now you have to talk to all of the named NPC's once again to glean information about the quest. Imagine having to do this for every single quest; Compounding irritation as you walk across town over and over and over again. This is required for every side-quest I had encountered in the first town.   Combat mechanics are just as irritating. The stamina stat exists solely to enforce spamming of both stamina and mana potions. Spell casting requires stamina and mana. Being struck by enemies consumes stamina. Attacking enemies consumes stamina. Stamina only regenerates out of combat, if you are not moving. You need to stand still and essentially not play the game for several minutes after each combat if you wish to regenerate stamina without potions. You can't walk back to town, or pick up loot, you can only do nothing.   Potions are relatively cheap, which is good. However, you can not bulk puchase potions. Each sizeable combat scenario, or dungeon, will have you consuming tens of potions. These are purchased from the abundant vendors by dragging and dropping items across inventory screens one item at a time. Enjoyable gameplay mechanic, right? BTW, your companions will need a plethora of health potions too. Fun!   TL:DR. I like the idea of this game, the art is pretty, but the core mechanics are far too irritating for me to recommend it.",

            "review_text": "Plenty of excellent written dialogue but the game is broken. it's not even mediocre. It's awful.   One of your first encounters is a spider. A very common enemy. After defeating my first spider, I noticed my character's health rapidly depleting - OH NO - I check my bags - chug a healing potion....but it's no good. The potion goes right out the hole in my stomach where the spider stung me. 80-90 seconds later I'm *dead* Are you kidding me? I'm dead in the first 3-4 minutes of gameplay? I check the internets for a cure to this spider venom, sure enough there is no cure. You have to learn a spell - but it's a level 2-3 tier spell which you can't get until much later in the game. And every cave you go into, heck even in random forests - you will encounter spiders.   The shops are so ridiculous I burst out laughing after I realized what I was dealing with. I am going to play out a scenario in the game for you:  You walk in to a thrift store and you are looking for a pair of headphones and you ask the shop owner if you have any - 'Sorry we are all out' says the blue-shirted employee. You nod. And then ask him again. He again tells you he does not have headphones. Determined you ask him a third time. He replies 'we have three in stock... But you don't have enough money'. Unsatisfied with his selection you ask him again if he has headphones. He replies he has no headphones at all including the three he just showed you. You ask again, finally he reveals to you that he has a pair of used headphones and they are cheap give you a bonus to your health points if you wear it. You buy it. You ask him again out of curiousity to see if he's holding out on you - this time he has headphones that are not used and are slightly better than the ones you just paid for.  Thats right, every single time you check a shop keepers inventory it changes. You could potentially sit there for hours until you see the scroll, sword, shield, whatever you want appear. You don't have to walk out the door to check, you simply click to speak to speak to him again.   Speaking of headphones, don't wear them while playing this game. Music and sound effects are so bad your brain will explode. The startup screen song sounds like a 5-year-old playing on a keyboard. Afte you start you get to keep listening to it over and over and over again. The bats, zombies, ghosts, spiders make painful squeals and grunts as you hit them. You will always hear them before you see them which is good because if there are spiders you'll be running for your life because if you get poisoned, your as good as dead. The only way you could sanely play this game is if you turned off the audio completely - too bad you need to hear for spiders. Seriously, if your freaked out by spiders this game won't help.  The monsters: 1/10 Where are all the demons? Witches? Why am I fighting orcs, zombies, ghosts, and SPIDERS (hate those things). I played the game for 20 hours, got nearly to the end of the first chapter and was completely unsatisified with the selection of enemies. How about a possessed man attacking me? Maybe imps? Witches? IDK - this is the scariest you can think of? The safest way to fight any mob in this game is to get your quickness skill up and run away while firing your short supply of arrows.   The story: ?/10 If you can't play the game, what difference does the story make. That's like a writer handing you all of the pages of his new book, out of order, and dirty from sitting the the backseat of his Buick Skyhawk. There will be better reviews on the story from people who can play this game.  Your companions: 5/10  You gain followers but if they die, they are dead until you gain a resurrect spell. So make sure you quick save every five seconds. All it takes is a quick spider bite. I only recruited I believe 3 companions in my time playing this game. There are a few more. They have little tiny stories but other than that.   The classes My biggest complaint is with mages. They created specializions that are really hard to remember. And when you buy scrolls to learn spells you have to buy for that specializtion to be used. I remember I bought the one that is suppose to make me posion resistant but then found out, it only does it a small percentage and got posioned by a spider anyways and had to chug 2-3 health potions.  Back to the spider - so if you get stung, you literally have to wait nearly 3-4 minutes for the poison effect to wear off. Which means, automatic death if you get stung, there is no way to avoid not drinking multiple potions. Potions can get expensive so I recommend fleeing to church and let the priests free heal you instead of sucking down expensive potions.   Boss battles and combat strategy 1/10 The trick here is simple. Summon a genie, ask him for protection. He will summon a spirit and it will do all the fighting and kill everything on screen including the boss. No need to get your hands dirty. This is not a joke. You can try to fight but you are so limited in combat options that it comes down to this - brute force and running away while fighting. Everytime. And if you don't have it or the space to run away (and you won't) you will be dead in seconds. I hope you quick saved. Demon Souls isn't even this unforgiving.  I suggest you fight the same 5 random zombies, bats, and spiders till you make enough gold to buy good equipment that gives you an experience boost. Then keep farming till you are at a much higher level. So if you see a spider, you can shoot it dead in a shot or two instead of 6-30 shots.   I can't recommend this game and unless you want to play a bad game for laughs but if you do play, do me a favor and kill a spider for me.  ",
