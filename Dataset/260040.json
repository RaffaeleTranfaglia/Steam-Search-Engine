    "description": "No, this is not a video of the YDKJ TV show that aired on ABC in 2001. It’s the YDKJ PC game with trivia all about TV shows! Fans of host Josh &quot;Schmitty&quot; Schmitstinstein will love this walk down boob-tube memory lane. If you thought all those hours of watching TV were good for nothing, then YOU DON’T KNOW JACK… Television!",

Hence I don't know a thing, and am reduced to guessing all the time xD Still nice for its nostalgic feeling and humor. Got all YDKJ games very cheap during the sale in a bundle, so it isn't worth complaining about the culture barriere. Overall, it is a nice game for now and then, but nothing special.   For this game in particular, you better know everything about ♥♥♥-old tv-shows, or you will fail as much as I did xD",
