Unlike it's big brother, Strike Suit Zero, this one has no story and it's all about clearing levels and getting high score by killing waves of enemies. After each level there you get cash that can be used to buy additional reinforcements. Has a pretty strong flavor of Gundam.",

Two main gripes with the game though. 1. No custom game mode as far as I'm aware (I have not beaten all the stages yet). You get thrown in a preset stage and you work through them.  2. I don't like having to manage credits and my fleet. If you want (need) a good fleet to take on the later stages with, the amount they give for selecting the stage isn't enough. You need to have it built up from several earlier stages. Also, your fleet does not carry over. Buy 2 frigates? Both of them live? Well say goodbye after the round is over, and no you aren't refunded credits. Why not just have an endless battle as an option? It gets expensive and kinda takes the fun out of it.  Other than that, it has all the greatness and flaws of the first game. The format of it just isn't too great.",

            "review_text": "Background: I have played and beat Strike Suit Zero / Director’s Cut. Close Lover of Space Sims and Ship to Ship 6x combat.   Synopsis: Its Three Dimensional Bullet Hell Lite. For those of you who have not played SSZ this is an Arcade style 6x space shooter. There are a number of flight suits to choose from each with different abilities in their Suit Mode, and individual stats that effect their performance in Flight Mode.   Every 3 levels or so you get a special Stage where the enemy is Limitless and you just have to Survive, I think the round is like 5 minutes, but you get scored on your performance and can unlock ship upgrades to boost your Energy levels, shields, etc.  It takes the base game, adds a few more Arcade style friendly features including a Global Scoreboard to compare your score against your friends and money that enables you to buy Allied Fighters and Capital Ships for a Stage. Allies are actually helpful and actively take part in the fight. Though it can be pretty embarrassing when they score more kills than you.   Final Thoughts: 10/10 would buy the Sequel. It’s an Endless rush of Wave after Wave of increasingly difficult and numerous foes with increasing A.I. reaction that will constantly test you and eventually overwhelm you. And thank goodness for Xbox Controller Support.  As Always watch gameplay videos before buying! ",

In Infinity we can allocate what kind of reinforcements we’ll be using in certain rounds and there’s a bigger incentive to try and save your teammates. Overall Infinity is fun and much tougher than Zero by far. A good challenge for those who’ve graduated from Zero. ",

I leave it for a year but i play it again after SSZ is on sale. This time I play it for 3-4 hours and I found it easy to control if you know some tricks (don't worry, play play and play likes sports)  You may think it's hard in first day because ship is too weak, weapon is too light. But yous ship and weapon will be good and reliable after you play it for 5-8 hours. After that, you will enjoy with shooting and flying in big sphere.  If you ask 'Will you buy SSZ or SSZ: Director's Cut? I will say 'NO' because I'm happy with SSI. I don't want to play long mission.",

While the game is absolutely gorgeous from its settings to music, it suffers from a few fatal flaws that made it hard for me to enjoy. The main problem would be the controls, I spent half of my time trying to make the damn craft fly straight. The other half was trying to dodge. The acceleration and combat aspects feel similar to a free roam Starfox, but the target reticle is near impossible to control. The enemies are too shifty to actually line up a shot making the dogfights feel chaotic at best. Mostly the missions consist of mayhem. If the aiming worked more like a first person shooter, I wouldn't have a problem with this game at all. But the game instead works on a scrolling system. If your crosshairs are even the slightest off centered, then the ship will move in that direction rapidly, so you constantly have to find the center of the screen to fly straight. Keep in mind that I had the game sensitivity and my mouse sensitivity set to the lowest possible setting. This game should take a page from the Tachyon games in my opinion. To sum up, this is a gorgeous game with an immersive atmosphere that put me in the cockpit, but the controls really made me dispise massive dogfights. Worth a try if you find it on sale.",

Sure, the graphics are crisp and it has a bit of a twist to the whole dogfighting thing, but there's just some things about it that ruin the experience for me. For starters, the gameplay is repetetive. Blow up an enemy fighter. Ok, cool. Now blow up an enemy transport. And then you just blow things up in space until you get bored. The other thing I hate is how the controls don't center off behind the cursor so if you pitch up, you'll just keep going up indefinetely until you manage to balance your cursor completely. Maybe that's just me though. The one thing I hate the most though, is the missile alert system. Two little, not very visible text boxes with no audio queue, isn't really enough to alert to you that you're about to blow up if you don't do something. I dunno what else to say, it's just not a game I could get behind.",
