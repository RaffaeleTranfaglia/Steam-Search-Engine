            "review_text": "Influent is a great idea. Though it does need some refining, it's a very helpful and affordable option for begginer to intermediate language learners.  If your only goal is to verbally pick up new key nouns and verbs for a trip abroad, Influent will suffice. However for more in-depth learners who wish to read it's best paired with good old fashioned studying. A primary example of this is that it won't help you understand how to actually read any languages that use non-roman-based characters (e.g. Russian, Chinese, Japanese). Note that you can enable english readings of any language if literacy isn't your primary goal.  I'm very excited to see a real game for language learning, instead of tedious and very over-priced software (Yeah, I'm looking at YOU, Rosetta Stone). I sincerely hope to eventually see DLCs or updates that will allow users to explore the world outside of the small apartment, add more unique yet commonplace items for each culture, or perhaps interact with NPCs to practice dialouge...crossing my fingers and keeping and eye on this game ;)  Pros: Playble area is filled to the brim with hundreds of everyday objects to study, DOES include verbs that will unlock as you learn nouns that they're relevant to, affordable, a highly customizeable and unique learning experience.  Cons: Small environment, UI is almost too minimalistic (can't cycle though word details; have to return to vocab list), and you can only learn commonplace North American items (useful but limited).",

            "review_text": "As a lover and learner of languages, i'm glad i found this little gem.  Influent puts you in the shoes of an inventor whose invention has been ripped-off! Yeah, a language game with somewhat of a plot, i know 0_0. it's pretty unique though and a little bit of a quirky side story. The inventor states on his Fire-starter page that to prove this invention is his he will master 400 words in a foreign language.  The game pretty much takes place in this guy's apartment and every item you click on teaches you the word in your language of choice. I was kindly gifted the Japanese version so for example if i click on the popsicles in the freezer the japanese characters or Romaji will show up (Japanese word for popsicles is aisukandi BTW :3 it's literally 'Ice Candy').  You can find a lot of different objects and in turn words all over the house. Collect 10 words to complete a set and then play a game where you search the house to match the words with the object. Do this enough times in the game and you will eventually master this word in-game! And i say in-game because whether or not you remember that word when you stop playing depends on your memory.  This game is pretty ingenious when it comes to teaching a foreign langauge. It uses a memory training technique that involves creating a map in your mind and remembering where and what things are. I've never thought of doing that in terms of learning languages because i first learned Japanese watching anime. So i learned a lot of common Japanese phrases from watching anime. Anime also introduced me to a lot of other languages here and there. Kampfer introduced me to German, Croisse in a Forgein Labrinyth introduced me to French and Hetalia introduced me to almost every language ever 0_0. So i learned more from audio only for quite some time. Then when i could afford language books at Barnes and Noble i'd buy a book for whatever language i wanted to learn at the time. But books don't have audio and often don't have visuals. So good luck with that...   Thankfully this game gives you both a visual and a voice to learn from. And from my experience with the Japanese language, the voice sounds like a real Japanese person saying the word. I even tested it on some words i already knew such as 'Hashi' (chopsticks) 'fraipan' (frying pan) and 'terebi' (TV). So far the words are totally accurate and i feel like i'm learning :D I even let my younger siblings play the game for a while and he picked up some words too, even messed around with the game's camera to look for words.  Sadly, though i am learning quite a lot and having fun re-freshing my Japanese vocabulary the game is mostly just for that... Expanding your vocabulary and knowledge of WORDS. You won't be learning any helpful phrases or learn how to form sentences. The apartment of the inventor in this game can also start feeling claustrophobic at times because you'll end up running around the same 4 rooms looking for words to learn. I tried to open the door out of the apartment but it won't open. It's a shame because i want to learn more words. There's only so much that can help you expand your vocabulary when you're limited only the the apartment setting. And if the game were expanded and you could open the door to the outside of the apartment THERE'S THE POTENCIAL FOR LEARNING MORE WORDS! Like what's the Japanese word for 'resturaunt' or 'laundramat' or 'hospital'? THERE'S SO MUCH MORE POTENCIAL IF YOU COULD EXIT THE APARTMENT SETTING! And think about the potencial for mini-games! Instead of just 'Time Attack' you could enter a restruant and learn what specific dishes are called or try to order food in that language, or you could go to a hospital for a check up and learn phrases specific to that enviornment.  That's the only bad thing i have to say about the game. If you could exit the apartment in the game there'd be so much more potencial and new words to discover. If not patching it into the game, i won't mind paying for it as DLC. It could be like an 'Around the Town' pack or something like that.   So until that comes out, i will recommend this game but don't expect it to make you an expert at whatever language you want to learn. It will teach you some helpful words but no phrases and the setting can feel claustrophobic after a while. I give this game 4.5 planes out of 5",

            "review_text": "For a begginer in a second language I have found this game to be helpful in that it is a small stepping stone on my way to learning words.  To clarify this, I am learning High German primarily from one fluent speaking friend, a couple of phone apps (which I find underwhelming), and this ... The only thing I could do to improve my rate of learning is take a German course and then immerse myself in the country.  But as I say, it is a small stepping stone, I do appreciate that it is devoloped by a single person (last time I checked), and that this person (or persons) has many other languages to update.  Where this falls down;  *No option to choose gender. *Gendered items of level solely male. (knowing what to call a wallet does not help me when I carry a purse) *Items, such as milk in the refrigerator, whilst when clicked are pronounced 'milch', still read 'milk' on the carton, this breaks much of the immersion. -  - I feel that when learning a language it is best not to translate object names, simply to hold it up and give it the correct name in that language, otherwise the association between terms will be forever referenced back to the first language and create a mental lag.  *Despite a female character being shown on the cover, she never makes an appearance, the player never gets to choose to play as her in her appartment. *No character interaction so as to learn grammar and how to use the words we learn in a sentence.  German has around four words for 'the', they are each gendered, and may be used in a non gendered way to indicate plural items or people, In-Fluent will not teach you this. -  - Rather than striving to, it could simply mention what it does not teach so as to make the user aware they will need to pick that up elsewhere.  *Character movement is clunky, to move around either mouse button must be clicked and dragged around. *It is not readily apparent to a player (well, at least me), that items once clicked then need to have their corresponding word below clicked so as to catalog them. *Some items are far too small and may wreck the experience of challenge mode, i.e trying to click on keys and clicking the bench they sit on is a constant problem. *This is a game that could benefit from the use of phonetics.  This game will teach you many household items, there are at least 200 words to catalog before learning other names for the same item depending on how it may be used in a sentence.  For the dedicated player I would say suppliment this with a lot of postit notes around the house of what objects are called in the language you are attempting to learn. -  - If you pronounce these as the game has been pronouncing these, you will likely be ever so slightly off with the accent, however walking about the house and saying the name of an item every time you interact with it will help your pronunciation alongside learning.  Although a lot of work has been put into this game I would suggest best to pick it up on Steam sale due to its current limitations.",

The question I guess is 'Is it worth it?'  I bought the Japanese DLC as I wanted another resource/option when it came to learning the language and had  NO EXPECTATIONS  apart from obviously being able to learn something.   SUMMARIZING THE EXPERIENCE :  It is an interactive way of learning basic words ( Nouns, Verbs, Adjectives ) and perhaps that is what it is meant for - Learning SOME basic words.    Spoiler below contains elaboration     As many others have and will point out - The game (as both a game and/or interactive learning/educational software) is very stale in its options. The entire game revolves around memorizing 10 words (either random or your selection) at a time and contains 2 modes of doing so - Either walk around and click on objects to learn how to say them in the language you wish to study or do so while piloting a toy plane (as shown in the trailer).    The game is also extremely simple to the point where certain parts are confusing and others quite redundant :  For example, having two ways of saying 'Book' - ほん (hon) and しょせき (shoseki) where after googling, according to wiki 'The former term only indicates bound books, and does not include scrolls. The latter is used for printed matter only. The most general term is 書物 (shomotsu), which means all written or printed matter that has been collected into a single unit, regardless of construction.' Whereas the game only says [This] &amp; [That] = Book.  Another example is when clicking on a 'Door' and going to 'Verb', it tells me しめる (shimeru) and ひらく (hiraku) means 'Open' (as in to open the door) when the first actually means 'to close/shut'.     At the end of the day however, do I recommend this game for $10 USD (or the price according to region) for what it offers?  ...If you asked me that in a nutshell, I would say No because to any beginner trying to learn a language, chances are it might do more harm than good. ( Yes, you learn words but having googled to confirm the definitions I am skeptical as to what I learn is indeed what is translated in-game. )   However if given the chance to elaborate and tell people 'Look, this is what you're going to get and a lot of things require confirmation on the internet.' then yes. Mainly because, this is another resource that can interest and provocate people to stop procrastinating and start learning a language (although it definitely can be improved in many ways). For me, that is good enough because I know motivation and determination are one of the hardest things to muster.  Maybe people were looking for something better but thinking about it, how one would go about explaining all the parts of the language from sentence structure to specifics on the language (in a game) might make it too complex for a beginner and confuse them even further.",

When I do that, the game usually perceives this as if I had selected this item twice, a complication during tests.

When it comes to learning a language, however, it is the person's attitude that makes the real difference. This means any tool is only as effective as the driver behind it.  All the same, I'd recommend this application to anyone who would like to fill their head with some words in another language.   As a game, it's not altogether fun, but it's certainly better than the alternative of trying to learn from a dictionary of random words.",

Everything that can reasonably be in a flat is in it. Most of those are really everyday-vocabulary that is useful to know but you also get things like 'coat rack' which might not be something you need in your early everyday-conversations. On the other hand e.g. stuff like 'car' or most animal are missing. Still I'd say that overall the large majority is really useful vocabulary - if you're practising nouns it's obvious how it works: it asks for table and you click on the table but adjectives and verbs it's different: you get them via nouns that have a connection with them. A plant grows, you wash laundry etc. That can get difficult when there is more than one association you can make. A poster might be beautiful but in this game it's only associated with a painting... - you can either practise a list of 10 words that you made or a random list of 10 words. There is no possibility to limit this random list to just those you don't know well, yet. I know that Russian 'banan' means 'banana' by now. I don't need to go over at again and again. A possibility to stop asking for vocabulary you have already mastered would have been nice.  For me those are only minor issues and I still think it's a great vocabulary-game.",

And, contrary to popular belief found in the reviews I've read, this game also teaches you verbs and adjectives, along with actual objects. This game will indeed not teach you an entire language (like I thought it would from first impression before reading further), but it teaches you more-than-basic (as in diverse) basic vocabulary, actions and description-words.   400 new words (not individual words I think, so more like 400 things) per language?  Bring it on.   I picked up the Japanese version and am having fun coming back to it here and there to expand my knowledge and learn.

It would be greatly improved with more interactvity, more games for memorization besides just 'point to the word'. Any kind of game with more interactivity than is provided here would be useful (such as 'find all the objects that begin with the letter 'A' kind of games, or 'find the food' games. Even puzzle games.)  Also, future updates or DLC with more locations and potentially more words would be a very useful improvement for players. 400 words is a great start, but people learning a language will need to know more tha just 'words around the house'.

You interact with things in your environment and learn their names in your chosen language, and when you've picked up enough words, you can review them in minigames.  I'm not sure I'd recommend this to a total beginner to French. This might be something that comes up later in the game, but I was confused to see that the game omits the proper gender articles for a given word. For instance, the word for 'book' is 'livre', which the game tells you is 'masculine'. That's correct, but then the game doesn't tell you what that means.  The minigames could use a little bit of work. Time Attack was my favorite one, where you're given a word and you have to run around and find the object the word corresponds to. So if you're given 'mur', you have to go and double click on a 'wall'. It's easy enough, but things get stressful when you have to click very precisely on a really small or skinny object and you're trying to do it as fast as possible to get a good score. I wish the hitboxes had been bigger on these objects, because even if I turn up mouse sensitivity, a stylo is SO MUCH SMALLER than the bureau, and it can be a pain getting my cursors to line up with a tiny object. The sluggish walk controls don't help much either.  The other minigame I tried out let you take control of a model plane and zoom around the room shooting objects that match up to a given word. Thing is, you have to shoot several times at an object (presumably to tell the game you REALLY, REALLY, REALLY do know the meaning of that word, even though the repetition isn't a feature of the other minigame) and your plane is constantly moving towards whatever point in space you're focusing on. This means that you have to sometimes turn around to get more breathing room to fire on the object until the game finally tells you you're correct, and THIS is an issue because the plane controls rather sluggishly, and also explodes upon touching just about anything.  Still, it was a good refresher for some vocabulary I'd forgotten. I could see this being useful as a side tool for a more in-depth language course.",

All this game allows you to do is learn basic vocabulary. That's it. You walk around inside a little apartment and click on objects, and the game tells you the name of the object in the language you've chosen, frequently alongside relevant adjectives and verbs (EG, clicking on a candle will tell you the word for 'candle' as well as the word for the verb 'light'). Then you can create vocabulary lists that will allow you to test your knowledge of these words.   It's very good for that, for learning some basic vocabulary in a new language. But it will not do anything else. It won't teach you any sort of grammar; you won't so much as learn how to put together a sentence properly in the subject language.   But if you're just learning the basics of a new language, or would like to, then this is good for that.

The whole concept of studying language while playing a videogame probably seems fantastic for every gamer like me, who also likes to broaden his knowledge everyday. However, Influent isn't what I expected it to be. I didn't do much research before buying, just a short review by someone who generally praised the game but mentioned lack of insight on japanese 'kanji', which immediately put japanese pack off my to-buy list. Therefore for starters, I picked up french pack.   After a bit more than 1 hour of playtime, I can pretty much say that for me the game is a large disappointment. The whole game is situated in a small condo which contains about 400 different objects that you can interract with, and consequently learn more about them in order to improve your vocabulary. Those consist mostly out of basic household items. In French, gender is of crucial importance, and although the game tells you which gender a certain object is, when you actually learn them, gender pronouns or indefinite articles are excluded from the actual word. For example instead of 'une lampe' or 'la lampe' you'll study 'lampe', which means you'll still need to study gender separatly. Furthermore, the game doesn't cover one bit of grammar.   The game itself isn't particularly fun either, since one is as already mentioned, trapped inside a small condo. If the game would include also some other everyday areas like playground, trainstation, gym, school etc. it would vastly improve the vocabulary covered, but I'm afraid this will either never be available or will be purchasable as a 'dlc', for which I honestly wouldn't waste a cent anymore since I don't consider the 400 foreign words to be worth of 10€, while you can learn them for free in (in a sense of content) much better covered 'game' called Duolingo, or Anki.  Summary: I love the basic idea, but it lacks a lot of content. Although it is obviously considered as a supplement to your language studies, I still believe that it could've included a lot more than just bare 400 words.",

My main problem with the game is with its terrible word list system. You select objects and add them to your vocabulary list. The list is broken up into groups of 10 words. To learn the words you must pick a list of 10 and test yourself on it. Organizing words in these lists is a nightmare since you can only swap 2 words at a time. With 400+ words in the game this becomes nearly impossible to organize. Also, you can't remove words you've added to your list or even move them to a 'learn later' section.",

I wouldn't recommend because all of the things that you are able to learn in each language is just going to be the surrounding of each rooms that you're stuck inside. No way to learn how to communicate, no way to learn how to use each proper word in a sentence.

If you are currently learning a language, this is a great method to practice and learn vocabulary, but if you looking for a module to start from square one, you should probably get a dedicated learning package. Again, this game has it's merits, many that I have written about for papers and such, but from a ludological perspective, it can you some work.",
