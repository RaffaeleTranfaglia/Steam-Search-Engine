The only points of interaction are clicking on the red explosive blocks   (and grey squares in the DLC)   so not much time is needed to figure out the solution.  The game is amusing for its large number of achievements (118) that are unlocked for trivial actions; for example, starting a level grants an achievement, while clearing it gives another. This can be an incentive for achievement hunters looking to boost their achievement count and game completion rate, and the designs (letters, numbers and basic punctuation) are useful for decorating profiles while keeping a homogenoeus theme.  Gameplay, however, is minimal; some coloured blocks are introduced in the later levels with new mechanics, but they do not affect the level much, and the objective remains the same. The game can also be completed in under 30 minutes which may be a deterrent for those looking to maximise their gaming dollars, but at least the low price means it is accessible to almost anyone.  Ultimately, (a big) part of the value lies in the achievements, so if that is what you are looking for, pick this game up, set aside a few minutes and enjoy some demolitions along the way.",

Zup!  is a simply 2D physics-based puzzle game about placing your box on a green surface to open a door. It's pretty simple and should be finished in approximately 15-20 minutes...which does admitably harm the cost of the game, but with card drops that you can sell, you can make back about 20 cents on the title.y  I found this game to be pretty fun and is still entertaining after completion though the replayability is relatively low. As you can imagine, I would (and did) purchase this game on sale (which this game seems to do at a 10% discount). Personally, the value of this game seems to be between 30-75 cents given what you're getting.  8/10 A fun, short experience that rains achievements down on you gloriously for your success.",
