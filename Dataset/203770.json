Certainly different from the other Paradox Interactive franchises but in the best way possible. Each Paradox Interactive grand strategy has their own unique focus of gameplay which corresponds accurately to the time period and Crusader Kings II has definitely nailed it with their focus on indepth feudal systems and royal relations.

            "review_text": "Crusader Kings II is an exceptional game in that no other title will make you feel like a ruler as well as it. You're not just a country, like in other grand strategy games. You are a ruler with qualities, flaws, vices and virtues. You can be a Duke who is a brilliant diplomat with a hunchback, an ugly, stuttering dimwit count, or a mastermind plotter/lesbian queen. (I'm NOT making it up). And you can be all that within in a single playthrough, as you re-incarnate into your heir when you die. You have to be good at managing your realm, but you've got to be even better at managing your dynasty by arranging favourable marriages, assassinate pretenders... It's all very involving and requires a lot of micro-management (which you may or may not like).  It's not without flaws: the interface could see much improvement and the game starts to slow down when you become powerful. By slow down, I don't mean that your computer has a hard time coping, I mean that there are many more events that require your constant attention, making things move at a slower pace. To be honest, after several hundred hours, I think I'm a bit burned with the game. And that, even though there are entire DLCs I haven't really explored yet: I have only really played as a Catholic or Muslim ruler, but DLCs let you play as pagans, Orthodoxes, republics...  And then there are a couple of Mods that are probably worth exploring as well: 'Game of Thrones' and 'Tamriel' (from the Elder scrolls series)  Still, with so much content and the unbeatable feeling of being an actual Middle-Ages ruler, it's hard to rate CKII anything lower than a 9 out of 10.",

The gameplay is so deep and so enjoying with Grand Strategy Games like CK2 that I almost regret picking it up. I sometimes wish I hadn't open Paradox's box of terrors and maybe I could've lived in ignorance and enjoyed Rome 2, Civ and Beyond Earth. But sadly, I did.

            "review_text": "I will not talk about how Crusader King II compares to other strategy games on the market because it wouldn't be fair to them. You do not compare a Picasso with children drawings from school. Students have to do quick flashy drawings for good grades, and do them as often as they can, with accent on flashy rather than on detail. Crusader Kings II is a game that puts the accent more on detail, quality rather than quantity.  The game itelf may feel a bit hard to understand at first, but if you give it a moment of your time, it will surprise you. But buyer be warn, if you just wanna play a game where you plug in, then all you do is fancy easy war TW style, or EUIV, then better avoid CK2. Crusader Kings II requires the player to think, quite a bit actually, and consider choices and plan ahead, sometimes for a few decades. It is a real strategy game, and as such it is a gem, since I do not think there is another game on the market that challenges you truly at this level and in such a complex way.  Why is it challenging? Well for one, you need to plan your dynasty, you need to plan your marriages to seek advantages and gains, secure the blood line, be wary of who will you end up playing next, and after that, manage your vassals, manage alliances which can only be made through marriage, manage your holdings so you can have more income and troops, manage your realm to pick laws which will either upset or make your vassals happy, or play nice to your liege if you are not independent, watch over your armies when you raise them, pick terrain carefully as it matters quite a bit, be carefull who you put in charge of your armies, watch over you flanks, be carefull what troops you use when, since the holding they come from gives them bonuses, plan your technological advancements, mind religion, convert, play the cardinal game, expand, go on crusades, plot to murder your enemies, to revoke titles, fabricate claims, and so much more.  You think that list is big? Its small, even more so, get a mod from the Paradox Forums, and you can get 2-3 times more features, some mods even take you to other worlds, use maps from settings you know and love and add a ton of events and new features. The ammount of depth this game and its modding community offer is mind boggling. Crusader Kings 2 is the Skyrim of Strategy Games. Its got depth, its got versatility, its got deep modability, its a gem.  And trust me, nothing compares to the feel you get, when after starting as a Count, you end up an Emperor for the first time...  UPDATE: 2 years and a lot of DLCs later... This game is killing my free time still. To date the most addictive game in my life. I've never spent so much time over so many years on the same game...",

            "review_text": "Quite simply one of the greatest strategy games ever made.  From the outset - Crusader Kings is not for everyone.   It will be best enjoyed by people who are interested in deep systems and the interplay between them. Those seeking a way to crack the 'optimal' way to play, and those seeking to 'win' will be disappointed, whereas those seeking emergent systems and effects will enjoy hundreds of hours of discovery.   It is therein that lies CK2's greatest strength - creating a narrative through emergent systems.  Crusader Kings II relies largely on the player setting their own goals and then working towards them. Be they immediate goals, medium term aspirations, or long term dreams, a large part of CK2's appeal lies in pondering how best to 'exploit the code' to reach your ends. In fact, the best way to play CK2 is not to play to win, but to let the game 'happen'; to let your dynasty's fortune ebb and flow with the passage of time, creating a narrative of a family streching across the centuries.    Crusader Kings 2 is a game that you can sink literally hundreds of hours into and still find out new and exciting things to do. CK2 isn't a perfect game; the learning curve can be steep, particularly for those new to the genre, and the presentation is a little short of the cutting edge. But, with a fantastic level of developer support, continual free and paid content additions, hundreds of mods, and a lively, friendly and supportive community, it is fair to say that CK2 is one of the greatest strategy games of all time and, for strategy fans, possibly one of the greatest games of all time. For this writer with over 30 years of gaming behind him and hundreds of hours on the game (mostly on the Gamersgate version), it's certainly cracked the Top Ten!",

            "review_text": "'Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.'  - Lord Acton  The Medieval Age wasn't the brightest moment in human history. War, Assassination, Torture, Greed, Betrayal; those are merely some of the words associated with the atrocities committed by the rulers of the realm. Some good and honest men have ruled, but most rulers couldn't resist the temptation from the power they wield; the power to rule. They were tempted to gain more power, and they are willing to use even the most atrocious of acts to gain it.  Crusader Kings II gives players a taste of that power.  Starting at any point from 1066 (Or 769 with a certain DLC enabled) to 1453, players are allowed to choose from a very large amount of historical characters that once ruled over a part of Europe and parts of Asia and Africa.   From the lowliest duke to the highest emperor, the game has no final objective whatsoever, leaving players to create their own story and decide their own goals for their dynasty.   Do you want to be the most prestigious family in the world? To work your way up and create an empire that will last for generations? Or simply to make sure your bloodline survives through all the coming conflict?   Grand strategy games typically put players as an eternal invisible guiding force controlling a single country, viewing the world from above as a map as they manage the country’s Politics, Economy, Military, and Diplomacy through various factors. These games use simple visuals to accommodate the large scale gameplay. There are no fancy Total War-like massive battles or anything of sort. Almost every aspect of the game depends on numbers. In other words, the main part gameplay is to manage those numbers and the various factors affecting it to the player’s benefit.  Crusader Kings II offers a sandbox grand strategy experience into a more personal level; giving players control over a single Catholic ruler (later DLCs adds the options to play as Muslim, Pagan, and Jewish rulers) and continue on as his/her heir after passing away.   Instead of dealing with faceless countries, the more personal approach allows the game to have a large amount of characters, be it a lord or a simple courtier. Every character in the game has their own set of skills, traits, and relations with other characters. A major part of the game is managing the relationship between characters by various interactions. You can cement the loyalty of your vassals by keeping them happy with gifts and inviting them to feasts. You can increase the odds of success of an assassination plot by inviting treacherous people within your target's court. You can declare a war for a title your courtier has a claim on. Be wary as other characters could do it to you as well. The best option is to trust no one, not even your friends and relatives. These interactions increase the depth of Crusader King II's strategic gameplay in a very dynamic way.  The trademark Paradox's grand strategy gameplay is still present, even if somewhat simplified by the time period. Politics are mostly done by the character interactions mentioned above; with the addition of a player-manageable council the players can use accomplish certain tasks. Economy is much more simplified, with very little emphasis on trade. Instead of training units to form standing armies, you form a temporary military force in time of war, then disband them when the war is over. Your military comes from raising levies both from your personally owned holdings and from your vassals. (Retinues were added with a DLC).   Religion plays a major role in the game, with each religion having some unique gameplay mechanic that differ them from the rest; such as the Papacy for Catholics and Decadence for Muslims. While the strategy gameplay itself for most the most part lacks depth compared to other Paradox grand strategy titles, Crusader Kings II still stands on its own as a well-made and unique game.  Crusader Kings II is visuals are simple, yet fitting for the game. The map is fully rendered in 3D, it’s nothing breathtaking, but you can still appreciate the beauty of its landscape; although you'll probably spend most of the time using the political map mode. The character portraits are a great mix of realism and cartoony art style which provides a variety of colorful characters faces.  The musical score for the game is also worth praising. While not all the music in the game is memorable, they rarely distract you from the game, and for the most part they complement your playthrough with a variety of beautiful music fitting for the era.  The game is without its flaws, of course. While the tutorial is an improvement from previous Paradox titles, you will still need to learn most of the game’s mechanics on your own by trial or error. While it could be a part of the fun of playing the game, some people may dislike it. I’ve encountered several minor bugs, but the game is fully playable as of now. Another minor complaint is the lack of naval combat. While historically there wasn’t a lot of naval combat at the era, I wish that navies could be more useful such as for blockading ports. But as for the time this review was written, the only use for navies is for troop transport.  Describing everything about Crusader Kings II’s in detail would take a lot of time and energy. Both of which you could be using right now to purchase and experience Crusader Kings II on your own! (Or at least try the demo) Go and create your own story with your dynasty. Be patient and play as an honest, good natured ruler. Or fall to the temptation of power and spill the blood of anyone who stands in your way. The choice is yours.  Deus Vult.",

            "review_text": "Crusader Kings II on first look seems like just another game styled after so many other well-known games that use an overhead map and a time period. That’s where things steer into a different direction. This game may well be the best game created by the game smiths at Paradox Development Studio. It’s a huge strategy game with layers. I would suggest running the tutorial in the game. In fact I would also suggest keeping the hints option on, it is full of valuable playing information.Taking place over a 400 year time span the players take on the persona of a character running the realms and struggling to make it in these troublesome times.Throughout the game life, the character deals with the world and other characters of the court, they have stats and traits; they marry, and have children in hopes of conceiving an heir to the throne. That is the main point too, having a legitimate heir to the kingdom. As that first main character grows older and or dies before their time, as long as there is an heir the game goes on to 1452. Hierarchy and the bloodline are of some importance in this game as it was in yee olden days.The game plays in different ways depending on how the player chooses to start. Hierarchy plays a role here. So if the player starts out as a lower rank of the upper class, say a Count, well you have some leveling to do. There is so much information to be had during game play it can be over whelming at times; thankfully Paradox Development Studio has integrated so many buttons and drop downs to assist the player in keeping track of events and information. Plus the game can be paused to take a break or assess the situation. The interface and game play seems polished enough, though the animations took some getting used to.As gaming goes in the grand strategy style, there is some replay ability here, with so much going on, try different playing styles, be aggressive, or less so. See how things turn out, be a tyrant if you like.The graphics of the lands and seas are beautiful to behold, with clouds shadow and weather passing over the lands as you look down from your almost celestial view from above. Sound is pleasing as well, with music and sound bites setting the mood for events appropriately. This is truly one of the better games to come out from Paradox Development Studio, now like most strategy games, things do not progress always at a fast pace. So some patience in gaming is involved here. Crusader Kings II is exactly the sort of game I was hoping it would be. As deep and complex as its predecessor, but more accessible.",

One day I get a letter, he wants peace as long as I fly his flage. Seeing as my wife was sick and had died a month before and her father was now losing a war I did not have the gold to help him win I had no other choice but to submit and accepted Norge rule. Immediatly the King of Norge invites me to his grand feast. He treats me well and offers me protection and safety. Alpha as ♥♥♥♥ King of Norge fights the Scots who have been bothering me for years. I ask if my son can marry his beautiful daughter who will one day be the Queen of Norge, and without question or hesitation he sends his daughter to Iceland and congradulates me on entering the family. WIth this my son is happy and I can concentrait on my kingdom. Over the next few years I build up a great army and nearly 1000 gold in wealth. However, I am an old man. I fear the fate of my father, I fear that soon I will die. The King of Norge is not a young man either anymore. One day I get another letter. The King of Norge is plaining to invade Scotland. Seeing as my other son married Godwinson (The King of England)'s daughter I was prepared to invade Scotland and claim all of England and thus most of northern Europe for the King of Norge. I constructed a fleet of ships, hired thousands of men from the country side and some extra mecenaries just in case, and set sail. This time I was prepared for battle, I knew what would come. It was minutes laters as I prepaired my assault that I watched a Scotish fleet came from the deep ocean and landed on my shores and slaughter my people. Half of Scotland fought me in Scotland while the other half banded together and invaded my homeland of Iceland.

I had just started running the game for the first time, and wanted to check out the King of where I actually lived. But then I saw the assassinate button. I pressed the assassinate button. There was suddenly a dead Scottish monarch and a massive civil war. Crusader Kings II is a ‘Grand Strategy Game’ by Paradox Entertainment, a lovingly created, complex board game of Europe, where you play as historical character. Unlike other strategy games, where you’re the godly hand that guides a country or force, here you’re a Count, Duke, King or Emperor, with all the extra complexities and joys that brings. You have to handle your lineage – marry, have children, assassinate children, change succession laws – so that the game continues. It is the only must in CKII: create an heir, or on death without one, it’s game over. The rest is really up to you. You could try and forge the Empire of Hispania as one of the Spanish Catholic kings, unifying the other catholic nations there and driving out the Muslim rulers. You could play peacefully as the King of Scotland in a different game, only stooping to war when vassals rebel for their own claims on your kingdom. With certain DLC, you could play as Muslim rulers in Africa and Saudi Arabia, Pagan rulers, or even as a patrician, vying for control of the sea highways and port to get the most profit possible.  The board deserves some explanation also: unlike many other strategy games, which use hexagonal or square tiles, here real counties are used, such as Gowrie, Cumberland, Middlesex, Badajoz, Leon, and Maine. And they aren’t just bits of land to get to make your Kingdom look bigger: they hold cities, castles and religious buildings that will increase the size of you or your vassal’s levies (army) when annexed and your income, from tax. You can even improve and build new holdings in these counties, to increase both of these. This is one of the many ways you spend your gold, along with creating kingdoms and duchies, hiring mercenaries, bribing the pope (yup!), assassinations, ect.  Though out the game, you will be collecting this gold from the taxes, which is the commodity you will be using most often. Also throughout your characters life, he’ll gain Prestige and Piety: both add to your end game score, which you can use to measure just how well you’ve done after playing all those hundreds of years. Both also act like currencies, with you gaining prestige and piety from certain wars and events, but losing them with other events such as destroying kingdom titles (prestige), creating empire and kingdoms (piety) and reforming pagan religions (piety). Upon your characters death, they add to your score – not, however, a reason to die early.  War is enjoyable in Crusader Kings II, but possibly not as important as in other strategy games. You can’t declare war, willy nilly. You must have a cause for war, the ‘cassus belli’. This at first feels very restrictive, as in some catholic countries, the only clear way to expand into neighbouring catholic nations is through the slow fabrication of a claim on the county. But eventually it blossoms into the complex strategy, as you juggle where to war with, with what cassus belli, to what end. It becomes delightfully full of opportunities. The Catholic Kingdoms can declare Holy Wars against Pagans and Muslims and claim their land, along with participating in the Crusades the Pope occasionally calls. You also have ‘De Jure Claims’, where you can conquer counties and land that belongs to the predefined ‘de jure’ duchies, kingdoms and empires, depending if you are a Duke, King or Emperor. Pagans can conquer any bordering counties, or subjugate entire kingdoms once in a life time. There is a treasure trove of reasons to war. And with your army, you can choose who leads the armies, and whether to engage them in battles against other armies, or to siege enemy provinces in the war. But it isn’t the only way to gain land: ensuring you’re the heir to the kingdom through assassinations and plots; through offering vassalization to the weaker, smaller independent rulers nearby. But wars are one of the more enjoyable points in the game, as long as you know how to handle them. There really is no better feeling than slowly building your independent duchy into a sprawling Empire over the years.  It is important to say that all the rulers on the map are actively acting towards their own goals, with the games superb AI letting hundreds of characters act and change Europe, even in places far from where you are playing. It is sometimes enjoyable to pause the game, and just look around the map, at what’s happening far away. Seeing distant kingdoms fracture, far of empires grow, really gives the game a sense of scale that is great.  And in multiplayer, you can have friends play in any of the Kingdoms, replacing one of the AI rulers. It can be incredible fun, with you playing as different Kingdoms, competing as you expand. You can choose whatever way you want to play with friends – you can assassinate them, declare war on them, or offer to join their wars. If they play as the same culture or religion, you may want to help them, to spread it, or fulfil goals that will help you all. With me and a friend playing Norse Pagans (Old Gods DLC), we started trying to expand my kingdom so that it controlled enough holy sites to reform the religion and grant us much needed security for successions. We’ve also had to aid each other during widespread civil and international war and bail each other out. It’s incredibly satisfying to bail your friends’ kingdom out of an independence war, and know they owe you one when you want to take over a nearby kingdom.  The downsides of the game is the initial bafflement due to the complexities of how to combine all the systems for your own benefit, and the occasionally irritation caused by wars for the kingdom after succession. Multiplayer also requires all other players must download the host save file every time they play, which can be a slow, but is thankfully all handled in game. This game is one for those who wish to carve a story and a kingdom out of Europe, and are willing to learn through all the complexities and systems to do so. Once the game finally clicks and you’re away with it, it really is a magnificent game. Whole heartedly recommended.",

'Shattered Retreat' So that imba unber steroid packed doom ball just retreated and I had to chase them all the way to their lands.

And again I had to run around threw all the map just to get into same doom ball with full morale and reinforcements!

Capitals, country locations, rivers, I know that stuff.  Which is nice.  This may be the most complete and well rounded historical simulator available, and its mechanics are unique without being gimmicky. You see CK2 is about forging a dynasty, which is a fancy way of saying a rules heavy family. It's technically sandbox and you can have quite a bit of fun with it. You can roleplay as the traits that you have, or just try to make every character into Julius Caesar, or just keep assasinating popes, forever and ever. When your character dies, whether it be at 4 or 88, the play goes to the direct heir, whether he or she be 4 or 88, and you are given control over their decision making process.   As long as your dynasty has not died out in terms of inheritance laws, and someone in your dynasty has a sufficient title the game will continue until it stops after maybe dozens or a hundred hours of game play. You manage titles under your realm. Count is the lowest, than Duchy, than King, than Emperor, with some variety on the names depending on your culture. The key here is feudalism, that is vassalage. The standard is to pledge fealty to someone of the next higher title, who then pledges fealty to the title above them. This standard is never reached unless you conquer the world and make it be reached. In general, there will be sovereign Dukes, Counts pledged directly to Kings, and Emperors often forgo vassal kings.   You have advisers which are assigned from your court, which is a pool of loyal or disloyal followers whom you can consider for various roles, and to accomplish various tasks. These advisers assist you in running the operations of your feifdom, and allow religious, educational, espionage, stewardship, and martial decisions. Each character has an RPG style stat for each of these, and these along with a portion of your wife's stats and your advisers stats creates the stats used in game for you.  Key decisions in this game are marriage, and war. Marriage is the influence you have over your dynasty, and you can get good traits, titles, claims on titles, or political alliances in exchange for the matrimony. Wars allow you to cement alliances and shape the geopolitical landscape. There is much more to the game, as it has surprising complexity, but this is not to be a guide.  The game is visually very appealing, despite largely being a giant map. The music is nice, and even after several hours you may not be bored. There is also a ton of DLC for this, for better or worse. These are largely all expansive on the game, and most will be on for most games. Some like the Sunset Invasion are cheesy alternative history which you likely will not want on at all times. There are an absurd number of starting rulers at any of a number of initial scenarios, and a bit of imagination makes all interactions fun as you write your own story of world history amongst the players who have interesting personalities derived from their traits. This game remains an absolute treasure, and is still updated from time to time.",

Same developer who made other great games like Europa Universalis 4, Victoria 2, Hearts of Iron 3 and Stellaris. This game is based on Middle Ages to start of renaissance, where EU4 starts. Without DLC starts around 1066, but if you have dlc\\'s like Old Gods and Charlemagne you can start it on 700\\'s.  However before saying this game is all about invading other lands like Civ and Total War, no. Because this game is unique. You rule your dynasty and lead it through the age. You have to control your family by marrying other people for example Holy Roman Empire\\'s princesses. Then you extend your family and realm. Same time there is world map, where you can invade land, like in every strategy game. But only land available is Europe, North Africa and part of Asia.   There are many events in this game. I\\'ll explain hordes, rebellions and crusades in this review. There are many hordes. For example Mongols and Abbasids. If you have Sunset Invasion DLC, Aztecs are gonna invade Europe too. Hordes born quickly and rise by invading all neighbor realms. They are hard to defeat but they collapse easily with rebellions. Rebellions are events where claimer of duchy of puppet state declare war on country and try to switch government or get independece. That\\'s why you see all rebellions threats on your intrique menu, so you can prepare at threats or plot to kill threats. And last, crusades. If you part of catholic or orthodox religion, pope or archbishop might declare crusade to invade Jerusalem, Anatolia or any lands where real life crusaders were. You don\\'t have to join crusade but if you join and get most points you\\'ll gain all lands that were invaded in crusade.  Family relations are pretty important as your sons that have bad relation with you might try to kill you or start rebellion. And affairs are just gonna anger your wife and your children. However having family member in countries like Holy Roman Empire might help you make alliance with them, so that is useful. On my game, I just spammed my every daughter on big countries, HRE, England, France and Byzantium.  Combat works really well, but units are pretty hard to make and army levies might rise too big.

            "review_text": "Great. Artifical Intelligence may destroy and enslave you. ENSLAAAVEE. It's a good game. You work with a dynasty. Your dynasty. In Europe and Africa. In High and Late Middle Ages. 1066 - 1453, 867 - 1453 with the DLC 'Old Gods'. You rule a country: From a small province to the greatest empire. You have your heirs, inherit laws and everything other, from taxes starting.   There are five levels of authority in the game; the four highest of which are playable at the start:  - Emperor, Kaiser, Basileus, Shahanshah, Khagan (highest ones).    - King, Shah, Despot, Sultan, Serene Doge, King Bishop, Khan, Prince Mayor. The title 'King' is equivalent to the title 'Archduke' if the holder bends the knee to an Emperor or person of equivalent title.    - Duke, Doux, Satrap, Emir, Doge, Grand Prince, High Chief, Prince Archbishop, Grand Mayor, Jarl, Petty King, Caliph.    - The second lowest rank is that of the Count – variations are Earl, Sheikh, Wâli, Marzban, Chief, Lord Mayor, Prince Bishop, Metropolitan (Orthodox).    -The lowest in-game rank of authority is that of the Baron – variations are Timariot, Shaman, Mayor, Bishop, Patrician – of which only Patrician is a playable rank if the player owns the The Republic DLC, as the government of only a single holding with no non-commoner courtiers to command would provide the player with very few or no opportunities for intrigue.    The basic provincial unit of the game is the 'county'. Each county contains a preset number of holdings, with the maximum being seven holdings in a single county, including the comital capital. The holdings can be of three types: castle, city or temple holding. A castle is ruled by a baron, a city is ruled by a Mayor, and a temple is ruled by a bishop (each one having their own cultural and religious variations, such as the Muslim Mosque). Generally, a county has a capital set on a barony, but some counties (most notably in Italy) have city or temples set as the capital (ex: Rome is a temple-capital county and Venice is a city-capital county). As the player incorporates a lay nobleman, it can only exert control adequate over counties with castles as capitals or he'll suffer the 'wrong holding type' penalty in revenue – thus, city and temple holdings must be given to mayors and bishops. Exceptionally, Muslim rulers can control Mosques, which grant piety points. If the player owns The Republic DLC, the player can also take control of a coastal republic, like Venice, Genoa, The Hansa, Gotland or Cherson. In this case city holdings, instead of baronies, can be held without penalty.   Realm Laws There are two kind of laws in the game: the Tax and Levy laws – which determine the taxes your vassals (feudal, burgher and clergymen vassals) must pay, and also the number of levies they must provide – and the Succession Laws – which can be of two types: gender and inheritance laws. Succession laws are of fundamental gameplay importance, as the game over condition is the player's inability of establishing a dynastic heir. As a rule, succession is patrilineal, which means marriage offsprings will always be from the father's dynasty, but there is the option of matrilineal marriages for female characters, which means the offspring will be from the mother's lineage.   Gender Laws are the following:  Agnatic – Only males inheirt  Agnatic-Cognatic – Females can inherit, but only if there are no eligible male heirs.  Absolute Cognatic – Women inheirt on the same grounds as men do. (this type of succession is only available to Basque culture characters and the rulers with Cathar religion)  However, although Paradox added Enatic (males are entirely excluded from succession) and Enatic-Cognatic (females have preference) succession, these are only accessible through modifications to the base game.   Inheritance Laws are:  Gavelkind – The most common law, in which the inheritance is divided among all eligible children, the oldest inheriting the primary title. This succession type allows for a 30% larger demesne, the disadvantage is that it fractures the demesne upon succession.   Feudal Elective – The heir elected by vassals holding elector titles inherits all titles. This type gives an opinion boost to vassals, but it might have an heir not from the players dynasty—therefore ending the game.   Seniority – the oldest dynasty member inherits all titles. The disadvantage is that it usually results in elder characters inheriting, potentially creating a quick succession of short-lived rulerships.   Primogeniture – the firstborn child inherits all titles, in depth-first search descent. Arguably the most advantageous inheritance type, but it incurs in a slight prestige penalty for landless progeny.   Agnatic Open/Turkish Succession – available to every Muslim character (and also the only type of succession available) – the son that holds most titles inherits all his father's titles.   Patrician Elective (With The Republic DLC) – the only succession type for Merchant Republics – the heir is decided upon by a calculation of age, prestige, and a unique campaign fund feature from the 5 patrician families. Only males can inherit.   Investiture - only succesion law for bishoprics where the successor can be appointent by the ruler if under Free Investiture or by the Pope if under Papal Investiture. If there is no appointed heir then the game will chose character from the court of the bishop or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the bishops court.   Elective Open – the only succession type for Republics (and also some types of holdings under the player level) – the game will chose a character from the republic rulers court or create a new character if there is no suitable characters in the mayors court.   Tanistry – open to Celtic Culture group which, like the Elective system allows vassals to choose the heir but restricts the choice to members of the current holders dynasty.   Ultimogeniture – the default succession type for Ilkhanate, the Golden Horde and the barony of Altenburg, in which the youngest child of the ruler inherits all the rulers titles upon their death.   Appointment - Used by Holy Orders feudal vassals called Commanders. All feudal titles are granted by the Grandmaster and revert back to him after the holder dies.   Papal Succession - Pope's succesion law where elected Cardinal's chose the next Pope among themselves. Only used by the Pope if the player owns the Sons of Abraham DLC.   King and Emperor-level characters also have a special set of available laws, the 'Crown Authority Laws', which simulate the power exerted by the monarch over his vassals. For example, with 'autonomous vassals law', the monarch cannot revoke vassal's titles, and they only provide levies to their liege if they hold him or her in high regard. In 'absolute crown authority law', the vassals are entirely forbidden of waging war against each other and foreign enemies and must provide a sizable amount of levies.  That's a really really good game for about 1894172381274109487128409 hours of gameplay.",

For everybody with more than a few hours to spend I absolutly recommend this game, in case you dont have the time to pass the learning curve (perhaps 5+ hours) and are looking for something more casual, quick and accesible try Crusader Kings II's 'younger brother' Sengoku.",

Removed from my heart and /common file. :(  EDIT: I gave the game a second chance and progressed well until receiving a sudden and inexplicable error message forced that game to a close too. I could not find any information online about what was happening so I signed up to the Paradox forums themselves and left a post in the relevant location asking for tech support. It has been viewed but gone unreplied to for the past two days. I guess you're scrwed whether you join the forums or not. In conclusion: don't purchase the game and don't support the developers.

This is a good thing and it's most active selling point - It's not a game you win or lose, it's a game you craft stories from - as all the other reviews will likely show!  It is a game that appeals to multiple playstyles. If you want to be the grand overseer, some sort of mini-god surveying all that you have and making incredibly far-sighted decisions about where to conquer, who to ally with and what wars to start, looking at it as a gamer rather than a character? You can.  If you want to look at it as the character you are, say King Eucedis 'The Fat' Salian of England, roleplaying as a man obsessed by excess, greed and pride, while simultaneously ruining future generations of your family tree by seducing all the courtier's wives and having a large pool of illegitemate children? You can  If you want to play it as a complete and total joviality, name your family the 'Megatrons' and rename every single English city after each Sonic the Hedgehog level, because why not? You can.  All of these and many more are games I've had. Sometimes the game hates you and wants you to suffer, such as letting your 25 year old genius, attractive king who has all the claims in the world die from a cough, leaving you to inherit as your 1 year old, dumb, hairlipped son, who immediately gets rebelled on by his better brother, leaving you a peniless and landless wreck. At other times, the game loves you and even though you played as a merciless, heartless father who had a child with his eldest son's wife (who also never had any more children) and then he immediately dies and because of your inheritance said child inherits, but the brother ends up staying loyal and true, which gives you more than enough forces to make the others kow-tow.  All of the above scenarios have happened. More have too. More still will. If you enjoy having fun stories to tell people, or even fun stories to look back on, this game is for you.  The only two downsides - The game has a lot of DLC, which all add a lot to the game. This is somewhat mitigated by them regularly being on sale, but the cost still adds up. I must admit though that even having that, I mostly still play as the Christian rulers that start off accessible, alongside the Norse - The key is to experiment after purchase of the base product with it online, as if the host has the DLC you can use it in an online match. That way you can get a feel for what you want.   The second downside is the game layout. The game is not massive on visuals, aside from the pretty map and such, so most of it is small character portraits and menus. This has the side of making the game complicated because it's not initially easy to understand where you go wrong.  But I promise you - if you put the time into the game, it pays off.",

Did you ever think you could have solved a standoff by quietly assassinating a regent, marrying off your sister to a mongolian despot, keeping a rival monarchs heir under lock and key by offering to 'educate' them before declaring a surprise war or carefully replacing all your precursors council members with men fiercely loyal to yourself?  Then step right this way my friend, as Crusader Kings 2 is essentially ALL that and a metric tonne more.  On the positive side Crusader Kings 2 is one of those games that benefits from a level of detail that should impress even the most brick-chewing and hardened history buff as the majority of its campaigns are based around the monarchs and clergy of the real middle ages. Paradox has done a laudible job in recreating the insane game of political backsies that these historical figures found themselves living through or dieing in. The fact that it also gives you a quick and easy way to look up more information on particularly interesting characters is a great example of tangential learning used in gaming. Further to this there's a truly dizzying amount of depth to the games mechanics that gives you an idea of just why every ruler had to have a retinue of advisors and counsels to help them manage information and make decisions. The lack of a strong structured narrative also gives the player a lot of freedom in how they tackle problems or exploit oppurtunities. It leads to some rather interesting emergent gameplay scenarios that I suspect people who enjoy the game while love swapping with other players just to compare how they each dealt with unexpected problems. It all adds together to give CS2 a real sense of atmosphere, refreshingly not in the usual 'dark, rainy and miserable' sense that highly atmospheric games often default to. You end up feeling like a man (or woman) with a bit of power under their belt but an order of magnitude more responsibility than you could possibly have been prepared for.  On the other hand...the user interface and tutorial could use a hell of a lot of work. Yes this is fairly par for the course in a Paradox game but it becomes more of a bugbear than usual in CS2 due to the sheer magnitude of information the game is required to communicate to the player. You open a single figure's profile and you're given their nationality, general skills, specific strengths and weaknesses, religion, marriage/betrothal status, claims to land and title, demense makeup, alliances, honourary titles, family tree, dynastic tree, vassals, retainers, your opinion of them, their opinions of you, their hopes and dreams...AGH! STOP! Look I just want to know who his heirs are so I can kidnap one of them!  Compounding this problem is that the number of possible avenues of play is quite large and, while the tutorial does it's level best to introduce us to all of them, it felt like trying to teach the specifics of circuit design to a confused panda: More difficult than nessecary and ultimately kind of pointless. When I sat down to go through the tutorial myself I had already initiated and succesfully resolved two murder plots by the time the game actually introduced me to the plotting and conspiracy system. Yet by the time my neighbours were marching over my home territory and I was running about in a flap trying to route them the game decided that now, after the invasion of my home had already begun, would be a good time to teach me about building static defences...on my island colony several thousand kilometeres away. Thanks CS2, you couldn't have mentioned this whole 'developing technology' thing a little earlier? Perhaps back before my paper thin walls had been breached by a ballistae?  Ultimately though once a player works out the ins and outs of the system, and yes that might take several decades of PHD level research and a small team of interns working around the clock, they'll find themselves immersed in a mechanically deep and highly immersive world that will reward them with... well probbably a poisoned cup of wine carried by your heir apparent but a historically accurate one nonetheless.",

When i first got the game i decided i would play in ireland at the 867 start date. i would eventually conquer all of ireland and scotland and wales. my king was king Eric V he was a badass as he had conquered wales for the glorius Irish empire. however his second son was lustful of the throne, his name was Bob (no joke) since i had the law that only the firstborn son of the ruler would succed, Bob killed his elder brother Aethulwulf and inherited the throne for himself, but thier was a crucial flaw in his plan. Aethulwulfs son Eric still lived, and the game let me play as Eric not bob. so i spent my entire reign as duke of connacht ploting to take back the throne that was rightfully mine. in the year 1024 me and my sons decided taht it was time to take my birthright. i demanded the throne but was rejected by uncle Bob and i started a civil war that would last 20 years. the irish and scottish lords on my side and the other lrish and welsh lords on bobs side. needless to say that war killed off 13 family members including Erics second and fourth son. by the end Eric had killed Bob and all his children, but was maimed. he died a year after taking the throne from his wound. i would later port this game into EU4 and conquer the world. when i was about to port my game to EU4 i looked at the history of my family, and Bobs name in history was 'Bob the bad' 100/10",

And finally, if you like playing The Sims but wish you could invade your neighbor and burn their ugly house down, well, I count myself fortunate to not be your vassal.  The gameplay really nails a humorous historical blend of strategy, simulation and role playing. The user interface is packed with information that can draw you in for hours, once you master the very steep learning cliff. The graphics are fairly minimal, but honestly just right for the game.  Unfortunately, so many of the extras that you wish you had control over are fairly pricey DLC, for what they get you. Want to tell your uppity heir to shave his stupid moustache? $4.99. Tired of everyone looking the same, wearing the same 5 outfits or having historically inaccurate ethnicities? $1.99, $0.99 and more for each part of the globe.  They have expanded the game several times, and the features continue to be added even if you don't by the expansion. From this standpoint, you can get many hours of new gaming experience out of it.  However this makes for an unpredictable experience. I bought the game to enjoy multiplayer with my wife. While the added features are great, the stability of the game has its ups and downs. Recently, the Mac version of the game has been very difficult to enjoy. Crashes to desktop and out-of-sync errors become more and more common as our conquests abound and demense expands. Any more, we can't reliably go for more than hour without one of us suffering a setback and having to fully reload the game.  Another common problem is that the game will protest that we have different versions when setting up the multiplayer server. This requires us to fully reload the game again.  I love the game and wish I could play it more. I'm not opposed to paid or free expansions and feature additions, but given the choice between a rock solid, unchanging game and a buggy, evolving game, I'll choose the former every time.",

Ultimately, Crusader Kings 2 is a game of emergent story. I don't remember my conquests as much as I remember the time that a once-favored cousin in Ulster managed to grab a piece of Italy through marriage and immediately defected to the Holy Roman Empire, leading to a massive war as I attempted to bring my wayward vassal to heel and left me managing a motley crew of dissatisfied Italians who now owed fealty to a distant Irish liege.",

If you get the DLC's you can play as the muslims in the east, become a caliphate and declare jihads and watch as your fellow believers sweep accross Europe in the name of Allah.   Bring the Byzantine Empire their previous glory and reform the Roman Empire, gaining justifications on all her previous holdings.  Watch in a twist of history as the Aztecs land on European shores bringing with them new and strange diseases. Watch as they cut down kingdoms and forge their own empire.  Play as a Republic, forgeing a dynasty of wealth and power through trade, then use this new wealth and power to cut out your own empire. (Like the Romans did!)  And soon you will be allowed to play as Pagans, like the vikings and plunder gold and wreak havoc in the name of Odin. Each Pagan will have its own unique taste.  You can even create your own Dynasty and play as yourself and your family.  I've got to say, the care they put into this game makes it 100% worth every (now extinct Canadian)penny I paid. Not to mention how open the game is to modding. There are mods that completely change the game. Play the Game of Thrones or Elder Scrolls! There are actually mods that allow it!

You ask as you boot up the game for the very first time. 6 hours later you are involved in a plot to kill your brother, crusading for the holy land, and your uncle is leading a revolt to lower your crown authority.  Crusader Kings 2 is a grand strategy game developed by Paradox that lets you play as a count, duke, king, or emperor during the timeframe of 1066 to 1453. Instead of most grand strategy games where your ruler lives forever, in Crusader Kings 2 your character will die and then you will continue to play has their heir until your dynasty is killed off or the game ends. In fact the entire game is based around you running your dynasty rather than your country. Good traits, prestige, and wealth are all passed down so it is important that you maintain good bloodlines, even if you need to kill a few family members off. The second part of the game is religion. When a Crusade or Jihad is called, you are expected to join and fight or suffer the consequences. Rulers of the same faith will tend not to go to war with each other while the opposites will. There is a lot more stuff I didn't mention but you are going to just have to play to find out.  The game, unfortunately, has the 'Paradox Plague' meaning that if you want to do anything (custom character/country) you are going to need to pay for the dlc. Even major things like playing as Islamic characters requires a dlc. Granted they are cheap and go on sale quite often, but it is still content that should already be in the game, or at least a free update. Thankfully the game has great mod support so you can play user created content.  Crusader kings 2 is worth your time and you will sink a ton of hours into it. There is a learning curve, but once you get over that you will be ruling with the best of them.   9/10   UPDATE: Get the EUIV converter.",

Intially, I just played the original game, since there's a pretty steep learning curve and the base game alone has tons of hours of gameplay by itself. The great thing about this game is, it a fully complete and deep game no matter if you decide to expand or not. With that said, each expansion has brought a different flavor and experience to the gameplay that I hadn't even known that I wanted until I was playing it. Having played them now, I would not be able to go back to just the original game as is. Even owning this game for as long as I have, I still play it on a consistent basis.  Some people argue about how expensive the game and all of it's DLC are. CK2 goes on sale like, every other month (if not more). Pick up a DLC here and there (theres so much in these that you really will be kept busy by the features in each) for a fraction of the regular price. Half of the DLCs you can ignore, because they are mainly eye candy things - extra skins or shields. I wouldn't worry about those until you have all the gameplay ones in your library.  And if all else fails, there's a great Game of Thrones mod.",

            "review_text": "Let me tell you some actual things that I've done in that Crusader Kings II:  I was the Queen of Wales, and I saw that the person who was third in line for the duchy of York was an unmarried woman. She had three young children, two boys and a girl. The current Duke of York was a young man, with a single son, and a chaste wife. I invited the woman who might inherit York to my court, and I arranged for her to marry into my family. Meanwhile, I betrothed all of her children to members of my family. Being a member of my court, she had little choice in the matter. Then, I murdered the Duke of York, sending assassins after him. It took a small fortune, but he was eliminated. His young son made a poor feudal lord, being four, and it was quite easy to convince his court to murder him. With that murder, my erstwhile courtier became the Duchess of York. Two generations later, thanks to my long term family planning, the Duchy of York came into the possession of my family.  I was a Scottish Duke, and I served my king loyally for two decades. He was my friend, my cousin, and I served with pride as his chancellor. But he sickened and died, and his young child became king. A wee lad of six, and I was made his regent and tutor. I also discovered that I was his heir. So, I murdered him, and usurped the crown. My new vassals were unhappy with my actions, so I purged them and replaced them with cousins. I betrothed my son to a brilliant, lustful Byzantine princess, and all seemed well. Until my son swore an oath of celibacy. With needs her husband could not fulfil, my daughter in law turned to me. Not so long after, a baby boy was born. I legitimized the child, murdered my son and my wife, and started over with my new family. I was known as Malcolm the Good.  I was the Empress of Cymru (once known as Britannia), and my realm had turned to the Cathar faith. The Cathar faith is a Catholic heresy that believed in reincarnation, that a person might be man or woman in any given life, and which believed in gender equality. Being Cathar, I was able to land a woman with a fine mind for tactics as a countess, and I made her my marshal. When the Caliph declared a Jihad against me, trying to retake Hispania, I gave her command of my armies. At times, all three flanks of my main force were commanded by women. That countess led my armies in every major battle, becoming pregnant twice during the course of the war despite being 39/40 at the time of the births. She was wounded more than once, she led armies into battle while being outnumbered 3:2 or worse, but she never lost a battle. She became the second most famous person in all of Europe at that time, with more prestige than the Pope or Caliph or Byzantine Emperor or the Khans. By all accounts, over three hundred thousand infidels were killed by her forces. After the war, she suffered from depression, she lost her courage, but she was still the best person to lead the fight in a Great Holy War against the Norse tribes, far from her home in Portugal. She died at home, and one of her born-on-a-battlefield sons succeeded her.  I was the head of the Norse faith and Queen of Denmark, and a treacherous family member gathered an army and struck directly at my capital. He destroyed my retinue army, and assaulted my capital. Outnumbered, with no support from my allies, with my other family members choosing to support the usurper, I was forced to surrender. I remained a duchess, but all of the barons and mayors and religious holdings in my territory reported to the usurper. For a decade, I raided Ireland and northern France, carrying off loot and hostages for ransom. Building myself a great hoard, I waited until the right moment. Eventually, the usurper became embroiled in a war in East Francia, fighting most of the still powerful Karling family. With his armies weakened, I hired mercenaries and I struck at his capital, assaulting it and all of his holdings. He tried to bring back his armies, but my own force outnumbered his almost four to one, and he was crushed. He died in battle, and I imprisoned his brother and heir; I banished him from my realm, reclaiming my rightful titles as head of the Norse faith and Queen of Denmark.  I have conquered Europe in Odin's name. I have forced the wives of my defeated foes to become my concubines, and I have shed oceans of blood in the name of women's rights. I have accidentally married my great-granddaughter and deliberately married my sister. I have served Popes and I have murdered Popes. I have been trained in the art of war by a Ronin. I have had misadventures involving a merry band of outlaws in my forests. I have restored the Roman Empire. I have murdered spouses for fun and profit. I have seen battlefields where the dead number in the tens of thousands, and fought wars where neither side could muster five hundred men. I have turned back the Mongol hordes, and I have watched in despair as they annihilated my armies. I have conquered Rome for Islam, and I have retaken Jerusalem for Christ. I have plotted, murdered, schemed, fabricated, built factions, sent bribes, hired mercenaries, raised armies, raised children, murdered children, arranged marriages, taken lovers, banished prisoners, executed prisoners, shown mercy to prisoners, died childless and alone, died with far too many children holding power and claims to the throne, and so much more.  If you approach Crusader Kings II as Risk with an annoying thing about people that you need to deal with every so often, you might have some fun, but you're missing out on the real game: Eugenics and Murder Simulator II. The game is totally not for everyone. It is NOT a game that people pick up quickly. But once you get into it, it's the deepest and most rewarding RPG ever made. It's about guiding a family through history, through the sinners and the saints, through the great kings and the terrible ones, it's about surviving all the multitudes of things that can go tragically wrong, and it's about the joy of crushing your enemies, to see them driven before you, and to hear the lamentation of their women.  As you might guess, I'm a fan. It really isn't for everyone, but if you have the patience to get to the point where you can take control of your own destiny there's really no game like it.",

I would most likely compare this game to chess, especially its tutorial. When my grandfather taught me chess, he showed me all the cute little figurines, showed which way they could move and kept winning for seven years, until I finally mastered the game enough to beat him.   This is exactly how I feel like with CKII. I played through the tutorial, read several different guides and have an extremely helpful friend with over a 1000 hours of this game under his belt - and I still very vaguely grasp what I'm doing. My daughter is the wife of the Kaiser - good stuff - but is it - but who should I kill... That's what a fraction of a second of the game feels like.   All of this is emphasized by the fact that you literally don't know what you are supposed to do - you choose it, there are no built-in goals.

I highly recommend this, with some of the major DLC - especially ones which add even more character interaction, choices, mechanics, etc. I'm currently playing as a merchant prince of Venice, and it really is a very different experience - I feel like some sort of mob boss.  My only complaint is the battle system. It's often just a frustration - which is why I was glad I didn't have to focus on it as a merchant prince of Venice.  (P.S.

Alot of people argue that this is because muslims weren't playable from the start. That's the most pathetic excuse I have ever read on Steam. So I could just release a fighting game where you can play faction x against faction y, but I charge extra so you can play faction y yourself? Even though all of the fighting moves were already in the game? You don't have to be a developer to know how easy it must've been to insert all these 'new' characters and change some attributes.  Summary: The developer intended to not release those unplayable religions from the start and locked them, so he could find a better date to release them as DLCs.",

Whenever you die, you play as whoever is in your line of succession. If someone who is not part of your dynasty is your heir and you die, it's game over. Along with this feature, you must also manage your family as well as your vassals, keeping them happy. Nothing is more annoying than having to open up the vassal tab, sort them by the lowest opinion and then having to funnel money to 6 people to keep them happy, only to have them send you a message, labeling you a pretender of the throne a few minutes later.

Nevertheless, I would estimate that this is the single game I've played the most since its release a couple of years ago.  2 important things have been the main contributors. The 'roleplaying' element is strong in this one. Taking the heritage of the original Crusader Kings, where the characters and their family relationships, rivalries and complex courts helped shaped the success of your dynasty in its rush to acquire titles, CK2 has let the concept blossom. You interact with characters - whether those in your own court and demesne or other families and title-holders, plotting against them, marrying them, sending assassins to help a title pass closer to one of your dynasty. There are lots and lots of events, random and semi-random to guide the freeform story taking place.  Secondly, Paradox have a fantastic DLC/update structure in place. Supported by paid DLC of two types, they have improved the game for two years already (and going strong for more), adding new mechanics and refining old ones. Major DLC usually involved adding a category of playable characters (originally only Christian feudal rulers available), but many of the core mechanics have just gone into the patches which have been going strong all this time. Cosmetic DLC has also been good and now well-priced for a quid or so.  It does take a little bit of effort to get into, and a Let's Play from youtube is highly recommend to get started, but if you're up for some personality-laden strategy, I don't know why you haven't already given this a go?!",

            "review_text": "One of the best, most addicting games on Steam. Short of Civ V and Skyrim, I think this is the game I have clocked the most hours on on Steam. You can make the game challenging for yourself, or just see what kind of crazy alternative history scenarios you can create.   The expansions (the DLC that cost a bit more than the others) have crazy value and the other dlc you can buy is just nice toppings if you care about what they have. I myself have mostly bought the songpacks, because I love the music they bring, but you can enjoy the game entirely without the packs. The expansions unlock more play options in the game, so I highly recommend you get them at least after you've played the game for a bit, as they are complete gamechangers.  Heck, if there's a deal like I'm seeing right now for winter sales, pay a little extra for the CKII Collection and get most of the stuff cheap. Right now the base game is 9,99€ and the collection, which includes at least four expansions and a lot of content packs is 19,99€. What a deal! That said, the base game is certainly worth the full price too.  What better review for the game than to give some real stories of great moments?  1. One of my earliest crazy alternate history scenarios was this: I started as the King of Scotland. Eventually I ended up (through intrigue and deceit) being married to the Empress of Byzantium (one of the most prestigious positions in the historical setting). This of course resulted in my daughter becoming Queen of Scotland and Empress of Byzantium.  2. With the Legacy of Rome expansions you can achieve one of the most rewarding things you can ever do in gaming. You can start off as a count in the Byzantine Empire and slowly make your way to becoming Emperor. You'd think that'd be enough, but no. You can then proceed to invade Jerusalem, Alexandria and other holy lands thus restoring the Pentarch and making Orthodoxy the de facto form of Christianity, allowing you to outright turn Catholism into a heresy! But wait, there's more. You are Emperor of Byzantium, also known internally as Rome. It's time to make everyone accept you as the Emperor of Rome. How? Reclaim the old areas, invade Rome and recreate the Roman Empire! First Rome, then the world.  3. The Empire of Scandinavia!",

My goal is to incorporate the 'missing' noble ranks into the existing ones in the game.  My plan would be to make it so a Baron that holds 2 or more baronies w/o holding a higher title would be Viscount (primary title); Counts that hold 2 or more counties w/0 holding a higher title would be Marquis (primary title), and vassal kings would instead be Grand Duke (if not of your dynasty) or Archduke (if from your dynasty) of (primary kingdom title).

Once you learned the game, you can set goals for yourself to strive for. Personally I like to fight for achievements, so that is my goal. This can only be done in hardmode which means you can never go to an earlier save to re-do an earlier mistake or anything. You can only go forward and if it means the end, then your game has ended and you have to start over. You can choose wherever you start so there's always that new feeling about the game.  Negative: The negative points are the amount of DLCs, there's actually too many and 50% of them are so tiny that they should just smack all of those together in one DLC pack (Units and portraits for example). They just did it this way so you spend more, the developer is abit disapointing in that regard. I shouldn't feel like they just want my money even though I know they do.

PROS  It's a grand strategy that focuses on managing your family, your friends, your acquaintances, your court, and then once you have all that in order you begin expanding your horizons to snooping into the business of your friends, family, enemies, and total strangers whose land you desire.  The graphics are more than what you usually see in games like this.  The sounds have that nice quality where they're not repetitive or annoying, but rather invoke response cues as to what's happening. When a character is born or dies you immediately know before the text telling you. If you'd like something else there are nice workshop mods for it, but base is satisfactory.  The music is pleasing and I would go so far as to describe it as relaxing. It always seems to be the right tempo.  The mechanics of managing the strength of your genepool and family traits are what is so addictive for me personally. I really get a feel for my characters and it allows me to roleplay them more than what I had expected from the genre. It's what will continue adding another couple hundred hours likely for a long time to come.  CONS  The multiplayer is incredibly fussy and most games result in crashing due to networking issues or come out unresolved in my experience, but I still play multiplayer because it's usually a few hours in and we start a new story the next time we play. Saving and reloading that save to continue is feesible, but sometimes too much of a hassle for my lot of friends.  The price tag. It repulses many because they feel as though they may miss out without the DLC and I understand, but here's a real kicker: If your friend has any DLC and hosts a game then you get to experience the DLC without purchasing.  As for the singleplayer aspect of needing DLC I suggest getting it on sale and knowing which DLCS you need to buy to get the most out of the game.  Recommended for gameplay/mechanics:  Sword of Islam - $10 - Adds Muslims as a playable religion.   Legacy of Rome -$5 - Adds many features that I take for granted now.  Old Gods - $15 Improves revolts. Older starting date. Pagans, Zoroastrians, and some nice events.  Sons of Abraham - $10 - Adds Jews. Adds on to Muslims and Christian religions as well.   Charlemagne - $15 - Family chronicle (A history of your gameplay that's really nice.), earlier starting date, adds Zunists, and the ability to create a custom kingdom.  Way of Life - $8 -(Loosely recommended. Changes gameplay a fair bit. Best experienced without first. Adds more roleplay depth and ability to define your character and their actions, but the NPCs use the mechanics as well so it changes the feel of base game, but I like it.)  Total cost including base game: $93.00  Your initial reaction is probably 'Ninety-three dollars!?' and I know. It seems outrageous, but I have five hundred hours and let me break down my rationalization of that.  The average price of a movie ticket is like $8.50 for about one and a half to two hours of entertainment.  The average price of a game of bowling is $10.00 per person roundabout. (It's been a while, so bare with me.)  In comparison I have a very high expectation of how much entertainment I should get from a videogame and I roughly put it at an hour per dollar spent. If I buy a new console or platform game and it is sixty bucks I expect sixty hours of gameplay from the title. The true gems are those that shatter that expectation to pieces.   CKII has given me five times my expectation and investment and continues to rack up more time. My initial one hundred and fifty hours were off the base game alone.  All things considered I owe it to Paradox and to my fellow gamers to strongly recommend this game.",

After defeating the lord of Sussex in a six month campaign, the lord of Surrey quickly decides to bend his knee. Unsatisfied, I turn my ire north to the lands of East Anglia. I send my chancellor to prove my claims on these lands and he finds much success. Using what remains of my mercenary forces, I quickly take the lands of the former King of East Anglia, throttling his pitifully small army with my vastly larger forces.  A war of succession breaks out in Mercia and I decide to support the much smaller rebel forces, with just enough support to drain both sides of their levies. My chancellor, a devout vassal and believer in my cause, has seen fit to begin writing documents showing my divine right to the lands of Mercia as well. Ten years of conflict in Mercia, and my claim is now well supported by the people of Mercia. I quickly send my army in to end the war, securing the title for the rebel king. However, his reign does not last long as my armies swiftly return to Mercia to press my own claim. At the age of 56, I have united many of the minor kingdoms of England, but my dream to unify the whole will not be fulfilled. As I lay dying from a terrible illness, my only son, Oswine, ascends to the throne in my stead.  Oswine's first priority is to deal with the troublesome King of Wessex, who has taken the ill belief that the lands he occupies do not belong to the Kingdom of Kent. After a bloody conflict claiming a large portion of both our forces, Oswine emerges the victor, slaying the enemy king on the field of battle and emerging as the sole Anglo-Saxon king in southern England. He is the first king to style himself as the King of England, and sends word to all other lords of England to bend the knee, or face swift retribution. Hwice and Lancaster submit without a fight, but Northumbria persists in its stubborn idea of independence. After gathering support from his vassals, Oswine leads a great host to smash the Northumbrian armies with the help of the Picts and redistributes the lands to the loyal families of his court. Seeing opportunity, he invites the third son of the late King of Cornwall to his court, granting him lands in northern England in exchange for leal service. Soon after, this new lord's claim on Cornwall is pressed, and the newly crowned Duke of Cornwall bends the knee as sworn vassal and defender of the realm.  But trouble is brewing in the north, the Picts are fighting a brutal civil war, and Oswine's allies are on the losing side of things. He gathers his men and leads a host north to assist, but he is ambushed by enemy raiders from distant lands. These raiders have come in great numbers and manage to mortally wound Oswine. His last few months are full of pain and agony at the loss of his hand. King Oswine, first King of England dies a maimed cripple leaving three sons to contend for the throne.   And that is just the first two characters in my campaign. There are many more stories to be had, many playthroughs. No other game has ever inspired me to create stories surrounding the happenings in my game. CK2 is hands down the best game I have ever played. If you are a fan of grand strategy, if you are a fan of roleplaying, if you are a fan of the medieval era, this game is what you have been waiting for.  It will be a challenge at first to learn the mechanics, but once you figure them out you are able to fabricate pretty much any kind of story you like. The AI isn't the smartest but is decent enough at backstabbing and finding weakness that it presents a moderate challenge when you have no idea what you are doing/start pretty powerless. I personally enjoy modding some of the files to make it even harder, increasing disease presence and opinion modifiers for AI, making them hate you even more. This is the kind of game that once you learn the mechanics, if you all you care about is strategical gameplay and your everlasting godlike judgement of what's best for the realm than you will think it isn't all that challenging even at high difficulties. It does take a while to get to that point, but you can still have a lot of fun just trying to role play the character you have. If they are cruel and ambitious, murder everyone on your way to the top. If they are charitable and humble, try giving away more land than you have to. Chaste and zealous? Be celebite. See the game gets a lot harder when you choose to the things the character probably would actually do based on their traits, rather than simply trying to win no matter what. At least, that's where all my hours have gone to, creating stories like the one above.  Very fun game, worth every penny.",

            "review_text": "My nominee for 'Just five more minutes' award 2016.  This is a dynastic simulation which comes well recommended. It will eat up much of your life, I started one game and lost 70 hours to it. I don't know what will happen if I start another. It is filled with DLC and purchasing a complete version of the game will cost about 150 USD. However, these DLC's drastically expand and change the gameplay into something much different from what it was on release and will continue to do so in the future.  To describe Crusader Kings, you are a dynastic lord, a count, duke, king, or emperor. There is no real win or lose situation other than to keep playing. Your assumed goal is to proliferate your dynasty into other families, marry into wealthy dynasties, and set things up so your successor will be in the best position to inherit the kingdom. Your real goal is to screw around and mess things up in whatever way your hubris takes you, sleep with your lord's wife, sell your daughter to a polish lord, cage one of the great houses of Venice and sell them to the Egyptians, whatever your fancy takes you. Everyone in the game, right down to the courtiers and peasant rebels, are individuals with their own stats, aspirations, goals, and families. Manipulating their desires and maneuvering to get into power will make you personify each of these people, especially when they betray you. You will scream 'You ♥♥♥♥♥! Did you forget who put your ♥♥♥ on that throne!?' at your computer over some plot.  The interface is bare and the map figures are not much to look at, this suits the type of game this is just fine. There is a lot of depth, economy, trade, alliances, holdings, relationships between all the NPC's. It will take time to figure out the many gameplay nuances, what holdings are valuable, who makes a desirable courtier, how to fill out your desmene, and other gameplay nuances. None of these are easy to figure out and usually come over the course of repeated failure and checking guides and faqs. This level of complicated combined with the directionless character of the game will turn people away and I don't blame them too much for doing so.  The largest issue I find with the game is the sheer amount of DLC this game has. It has been released gradually over the years since this game has been released and update several gameplay functions and expand several parts of the map. On release, Crusader Kings II only covered Catholic Christian feudal kingdoms in Western Europe starting from the Middle Ages. Now, it includes Central Africa, India, Asia, their religions, and timelines going as far back as the beginning of Charlemagne along with the different type of governments - nomadic, tribal, Indian, Islamic, and city-state. The down side is that gathering all the things which do this will require you to sink 150 USD or so on a purchase of the game. It's no small matter and were it not for the thousands of hours you can sink into the game and the replayability each of the DLC's add, I wouldn't recommend it. Even without DLC, the core game remains a solid game which will leave you with many, many hours of your life gone. If you find you enjoy what you play, you can add a DLC for a different civilization and replay from there.   This is a solid grand strategy game with a lot of attention to detail and a lot of care put into its mechanics and personality. The detail will be off putting to some and desirable to others. If you are a fan of grand strategy this is definitely one to pick up.",

Its almost like a role-playing game mixed with a strategy game and it makes it fun, funny and exciting.  An example game I had was as the roman emporer I wanted to marry a genius girl married to a courtier of my dukes. So I send out my assassign to kill the man with a 10% chance of being discovered. He fails and I get caught. I send him again... and fails and I get caught. My duke takes me court twice to reveal I had broken the feudal contract and acted dishonerabley. I try one more time to kill the guy and succeed.... but get caught and the same dam duke takes me court over it. Any chance for the duke to give me her hand in marriage is over. I am nationally embarressed and every noble in the realm now looks at me funny. I am at the brink of civil war..... So I freak. I take all my personal levy and go to each duke one at a time revoke their duchies, giving them to someone else. So by being dishonorable I subsequently go and bully everyone saveing my empire and weaken the nobility. And the kicker? I get to marry the women since her duke is in jail.  This game is good stuff.

Legacy of Rome (because the pope can go suck on my Byzantine nuts) Sword of Islam (because kebab is stronk (until the pope decides to attack)) and maybe Rajas of India (because who doesn't want control over an IT Tech Support Empire)  With that said, It must be said that this game has an insane learning curve curvier than yo' mama and the tutorial won't teach you anything. The way to learn to play is by checking out some let's plays on YouTube or by simply learning for yourself.  This game's strong point is with it's RPG elements and the way the story of your dynasty plays out. The objective of the game is to make sure your dynasty survives until 1453 and getting as much prestige and piety along the way. You can play as any earl/duke/king/emperor from Europe to the Sahara to the Middle East to India to Eurasia from the mid 8th century (if you have the Charlemagne DLC) to 1453. You play as one person and when said person dies you continue playing as their heir, but if your heir is not of your dynasty or you don't have one, then it's game over. A sure way of getting as many heirs as possible is by being a ♥♥♥♥ and legitamising as many of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s as you see fit, however this does lead to bitter rivalries among your children. Despite trying to keep your dynasty alive, there are no real goals and this is where the RPG elements shine through. You can play as an earl and work your way up through the fuedal system to king/emperor, you can expand your lands and become king or emperor, and my favourite is playing as Byzantium and setting my sights on restoring the Roman Empire and mending the great schism (which is why you need Legacy of Rome plus some other features it adds to Byzantium). You can also plot to kill people, ♥♥♥♥ your cousin, care for your family, ♥♥♥♥ your cousin, learn the secrets of the stars, ♥♥♥♥ your cousin, and you can ♥♥♥♥ your sister!  If you're a history nerd like me you will have endless fun with CKII and if you're also into the Renaissance and early Industrial Era then you should also pick up Europa Universallis IV and get a converter so your CKII save can go directly into EUIV, which is nice.  10/10 - would marry my sister again",

            "review_text": "Fantastic role-playing strategy game which is extremely satisfying and very fun to play. Steep learning curve but totally worth investing the time as when it clicks it is so enjoyable. I recommend watching YouTube videos by the likes of Quill18, Tekkor, Arumba and/or Northernlion to help you find your feet. I'm enjoying it so much because the game creates some great stories and provides a lot of fun role-playing opportunities. I can see myself continuing to put a lot of hours into this amazing game.  CKII is not a typical strategy game as it has heavy role-playing aspects and is about managing a dynasty and acting on behalf of characters rather than countries. The game creates some great scenarios and you can get really involved in the stories that it generates. It might be that you start as some petty little count trying to amass power through whatever cunning and devious means that you can, much like playing out an episode of Blackadder! Or it could be that you are a powerful king ready to destroy those who might attempt to dethrone you. You easily become engrossed in the stories and the petty squabbles with your vassals or your overlords.   It seems worth mentioning the DLC here as it can seem somewhat overwhelming to a new player. I regularly get asked which DLCs I recommend and if any add vital things to the game experience. Ultimately, a great deal of the DLC is cosmetic (portraits, shields, units and extra music) so none of these are needed at all but you might feel it is nice to freshen up the game later on with some new music or portraits after you've been playing for 100s of hours. I must mention the music here, which is absolutely excellent (it is composed by Andreas Waldetoft who has also produced high quality music for EUIV and other Paradox titles). Anyway, regarding these minor DLCs, you can always wait for another sale on Steam for this kind of thing and pick them up at a super cheap price. CKII tends to go on sale a lot.  The DLC that is actually significant in terms of game play is as follows:  - The Old Gods (one of the best DLCs because it adds a new start date in 867 and the opportunity to play various pagan rulers, with an emphasis on the Vikings, which is an absolute blast)  - The Republic (ability to play Merchant Republics such as Venice, Genoa, Pisa etc. so only really needed if you want to do that in the game)  - Legacy of Rome (this is definitely worth picking up as it adds some useful stuff, not least the ability to use retinues to have standing armies. It's one of the cheaper of the main DLCs)  - Sword of Islam (makes Muslim rulers playable and adds a whole bunch of events and mechanics specific to them - so only needed if you want to get into playing a Muslim ruler)  - Sons of Abraham which adds more depth to the Abrahamic religions (Christianity, Islam and Judaism).   - Sunset Invasion (this is a fictional and non-historical add-on that I've never used - bit of a strange release from Paradox for this game - you don't need this at all unless it strikes you as being interesting)  - A smaller DLC worth mentioning is the Ruler Designer, which is quite fun too, allowing you to create your own ruler with traits etc. I mostly play as the historical characters but it can be nice to throw together a custom character for a bit of fun.  - Recently, they have added the Rajas of India (making Indian characters playable), Charlemagne (with a new start date of 769) and Way of Life (a role-play DLC).   Ultimately, you can pick and choose what you are interested in with the DLC. It might be that you have a certain interest in one of the DLCs but ultimately a huge amount of hours can be put into the base game with the vanilla 1066 start. You don't desperately need any of the DLC but I think the only thing that it would be nice (not essential) to have is The Legacy of Rome, in my opinion, for the reasons I outlined above.  My favourite DLCs are Legacy of Rome and The Old Gods. The latter is probably one of the best DLCs I have bought for a game. I've had such a blast with all of The Old Gods content. So much fun!",

Look at how much i have played this game, i don't get much time to play games as i am at University but when i do this is the game i go to.   The game is a Grand Strategy game which means you do not take control of battles, instead you are in control of the state, deciding its politics and making sure that you become a pre-eminent power in Europe. Now that doesn't sound that as unique as the other games paradox have made, but as well as a grand strategy this is an RPG.   First of all the RPG elements are not like Mass Effect or Skyrim, they are event based which means you decide how certain events go and see where it takes you. You can become a benevolent ruler who is just and kind, or you can become a intricate web weaver, assassinating rivals and killing siblings. You can even become insane or/and possessed!  Now there is A LOT of DLC for this game and that can put you off. But this has not been pulled from the game (well most of it hasn't), instead they have been developed after the main game came out and add a variety of RPG enhancements and events. They also enable you to play different religions and cultures. The DLCs i would recommend are: Sword of Islam Legacy of Rome Old Gods Sons of Abraham Way of Life Charlemagne  They are all the major expansions except for Raja's of India and Republics which i found were a bit lacking and can be left out without any major changes. All the other Dynasty shield packs and song packs are totally optional (although if you are going to buy one song pack buy the Old Gods one).  This game is worth full price and will give you hundreds of hours of game content and will give you an experience you  will never forget.

Even without the huge load of DLCs and workshop items that add infinite customization (whole new maps, for example) this game has enjoyable political and diplomatical systems and goes good with the military side, giving you the feeling of growth as the time goes by and your land becomes larger.  I like how you can screw up with a few bad decision or how the system can screw you up with a random event with no way to prevent it, since it's fun to recover from something bad after all. I like how every character has an opinion on every other character and the intricate system that manages traits and stats making every person unique. I like the hierarchical system with different levels of nobles giving you the real feel of climbing the power ladder, or failing trying. I like how wars are managed, the fact that you wage war to conquer something, then you can take whatever you want during the war but you only keep the something you started the war for. I like the dinasty system, family trees always win for me, and with the possibility to forge alliance by strategical marriages there's no limit on what you can do.  At start you feel like you can do almost nothing. You have a weak army, comparable to the ones of your neighbours, you have low cash, so you can't build anything, you have no vassals (assuming you like starting small and ramping up), but the more you advance, the more possibilities come up. And still you can destroy everything you build by a bad election choice for example, or by timing badly a war, or stuff like that. The fact that the game lasts for a set number of years makes it like there is no actual victory, but only personal achievements to grab during every single game. Of course you can lose, like I'm about to do on my second big game for insulting my liege thinking he was my neighour, silly me!  Totally suggested! And buy DLCs too, when you get the hang of the game, they really add nice stuff to do.

There are also great mods and some really nice dlcs to add to that content, although the game is pretty complete by its own. For starters in this genre of strategy games or in Paradox games in general, Crusader Kings 2 should prove the best choice. It is not so difficult to get into and has the hole high degree of personalization of the strategy with all the rpg aspects of the game that makes some players praise it as the best game of Paradox. It is in reality a very different game from the other Paradox games such as Europa Universalis or Victoria that provides an unique kind of fun as you control the rulers instead of the nations. I personally think that despite some flaws it emcopasses very well the time spam of the Middle Ages and couldn´t recommend more for any player of strategy that is fond of that period of history and of the presence of rpg elements in games in general. Finally, don´t bother with the original Crusader Kings as this one is far superior - something that is not very common nowadays with all the awful sequels we are seeing.",

I hear that Paradox's other grand strategies like Victoria and EU are similar, but I haven't played them. So for me, CK2 stands alone.",

(It's only drawback is the lack of realtime battles, and that is not a huge problem to me) More than a strategy game, it's an entire alternative history generater and dynastic simulation.

Combining the depth of an RTS with the addictiveness of an RPG, this game is unique and brilliant. If you are someone who enjoys strategy games such as total war as well as RPGs, you should grab this game when it is on a steam sale. It is 100% worth it at full price, but it is one of the most frequently on-sale games on steam so you wont have to wait long. The learning curve appears steep at first, but after you look around at all the menus it's rather intuitive. My advice is to watch a lets-play on youtube, visit the forums, and don't be afraid to spend 3-4 hours experimenting and not knowing what the hell to do. Thats exactly how I got into the game, and it was worth it.",

Killing your own brother who owns many estates with no legitimate heir, (Or kill the Heir ;)) you will inherit those states. Raising armies is also a fun way of going about, as well as to play on the map that comprises of Russia, All of Europe, and Iceland, and the middle east and Africa gives you the realistic point of view of actually being a count, Duke, King that wants to seize absoloute power. Getting your daughters and sons to marry into another empire then taking over that empire is just truly outstanding.  DLC makes this game even way more fun and the Game of Thrones mod i have heard is just excellent to uphold.  I reccomend this game to anyone that enjoys a realistic dominion warfare game, and as unusual for me, this game as my first has to be rated a 10/10 score for just the excellence.",

But that has also turned out in the long run to be its greatest strength and the reason I have put 560+ hours into this game. You decide what you want to do. Want to restore the Roman Empire? Sure. Take your Norse Viking raiders south and sack Venice? Why not? Mend The Great Schism and see Christianity as the dominant religion across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East? You can do that too.  All those possibilities and more are within the core game itself. Then come the limitless options that the mod community have created for CK2. The ease of modding that Paradox has allowed and nurtured has spawned a great many mods that play like their own full game.

OF ALL TIME!  You play as an individual, head of a preset house (created house if you get the ruler designer dlc). You ultimate goal is what you want it to be.   Want to start of as a lowly count/countess working his/her way up the social pecking order by getting the nobles of the realm to support your forged claim to your neighbor's title? You can do that! Or say you want a crown on YOUR crown, so you bribe the nobles of the realm to join your faction to force the King to change the inheritance laws of the kingdom from primogenture to elective so you can put your name up for nomination? You can do that too! Or say you want to start of as a King/Sultan/Caliph/Emperor and fight those very vassals who would try such a treasonous act, YOU CAN!  I can go on and on about the multitude of things you can do, from growing your family tree by marrying a wealthy duke's daughter so your son will have a claim to the duke's lands when he finally kicks the bucket. From growing old, dying and passing everything to you son, which as the new head of the house you will now play as. Say, what about your daughter? She is more capable than your current character's son! Change the inheritance laws to give you daughter a claim.  Use diplomacy to normalize relations, marriage to seal alliances, war to conquer you enemies, intrigue to assassinate your rivals, piety to gain the favor of the Pope/Caliph/Grand Priest, it goes on and on.  The rpg element is enhanced by a large and ever growing event system which helps form your current character's personality by gaining new traits, or losing them, based on your decisions. Educate your children yourself or have them assigned to a trusted retainer. Grow your influence and power by inviting talented people to your court and appointing them to your council. Hand out titles to your vassals to keep them loyal, or seize their titles when/if they plot against you. Deliver justice or Cry Havoc, and let slip the dogs of war!  This game has MANY dlcs, all of which expand the cultures, immersion, music, appearance, gameplay, features and possibilities in some way. I highly recommend the culture portrait DLCs, ruler designer, major gameplay DLCs like the Horse Lords, Old Gods, ect. But they are all good and imo modestly priced.  Okay I could say more, but I wanna play Crusader Kings II now! Which brings me to my only real beef with this game... its extremely addicting and you will lose much needed rest and sunlight! Just stick your head out of your room every now and then to let everyone know you are still alive.",

To me Crusader Kings II is a game about creating  interesting stories . I'll elaborate: The most interesting moments in this game usually are so random and unexpected, that when you tell other people who play CK2 they will be genuinely interested and intrigued by them.  It really feels like anything and everything can happen . It is total chaos. Sometimes EVERYTHING goes wrong, for instance your heir turns out to be an ugly midget homosexual who inherits the Holy Roman Empire and everyone hates him so much that the Holy Roman Empire just falls apart.   Learning curve wise it is a lot simpler than the EU franchise or god frobid, Hearts of Iron, but i feel that speaks more to the complexity of other grand strategies. It will stil take your at least a week to get most of the mechanics down. It might even take longer.   This leads to the final part of my review - the expansions. This game features a plethora of  great expansions  that truly change the pase of the game. They add more interesting mechanics and make the game even more interesting, . I'd recommend getting the entire shebang of major expansions as a bundle when it's on sale. It's definitely worth it.   Overall i think this is a great game and  it gets even better when you play with friends .   If you like complex strategy games and empire management, i think you will love this. :)  ",

This game contains alot of history from the real world and allows you to control the outcome of. Ofcourse some people will not understand what i am saying so let me give you an example. If you want to play as Any of the leaders your outcome could change from what really happened, Its stratigy game that you need to think as a leader not a player. As a player your aim is to rule your country and stretch your dynasty as long as possable. If you die with no heirs the game will end and you will have a score and a summary of the dynasty you beat in score.  2. What happens if I die in the game? If you die as a ruler for any reason and have no heir the game ends. You need to have an heir to continue playing when you die.  3. Why should i buy this instead of any other game like Civ or Cursadar castle? Well this game is unique because of its features that make the game come alive, you dont die in civ as a leader you get conquered same in Crusadar castle, but in cursader kings your main focus is your right to choose. If you want to conquer people then thats your focus if you want to try and get a heir your focus, the game gives you the freedom to choose what  You  want to choose and thats a feature other games do not have. The game lets you have your freedom to choose, but there is always a backside like in real life you choose and your choice has its effect, Its the same in game. So lets say you attacked england as ireland and you had enough men, but you though that england didnt have an alliance with scotland, but then they got one as soon as you declared then I can assure you you will need to get that pot of gold and give it to enland and scotland so they dont give you the  D .  Summary: If you like history and stratigy like me then this is the game for you. It is really original and very fun and i recommend to Buy it right now.",

I went into this game thinking i was gonna play as a noble ruler protecting his people, but soon you find out the lenghts you are willing to forsake your own morality in order to further the goals of your dynasty and your nation, Machiovelian scheming is almost a must in order to survive in the world.  This game is actually the best critique of power imaginable, all sence of idealism and values are gone and you soon become a monster yourself, there is a very fitting Nichze quote about this.

Not only have an heir, but have a good hair, make marry your heirs to the hairs of other kingdom to acquire them or gove in marriege your doughter to forge new alliances. - Your player is evolving. You need to develp him/her, train to have higher skills that allow you to have access to options in the events (such as persuasion with high diplomacy etc.). - You need to take care of the education of your children to have good heirs and good 'material' for the marriages. - Your vassals are very ambitious and you need to take care of them (both in the positive and negative way) to not face bigrebellions. - Great map with a lof of territories and possibilities to expand your realm. - Good managment of the religion. - You need to spend some times to understand the dynamics of the game, otherwise you cannot enjoy it at all the levels and have a great game experience.  It's the best game of Paradox. Absolutely a must for everyone loves this kind of games and this brand.",

            "review_text": "Crusader Kings 2 is one of the, if no the, best strategy game i have ever played. At the beginning of the game you are shown an accurate political map of europe for the start date you choose to start in, you then choose a character to play as, you may start as the grand basileus of the Byzantine Empire and fight back the invading Seljuk sultunate in a glorious battle with the varangian guard at your side, or simply a lowly count of devon trying avoid the norman and norwegian armies attacking anglo-saxon England (in the 1066 start date). I have played over 200 hours of this game so I am speaking from experience and I strongly recommend you ignore the reviewers who have played between 1-10 hours of the game as it it NOT long enough to repect the game for what it is. Positive aspects of the game: 1) very historically accurate characters and nations at the start of the game 2) many different events to keep the game interesting 3) many different interactions with your' subjects 4) with no dlc there is 400 years of medieval history to play through, with all dlc there is 700 years! 5) In depth medieval politics and accurate feudal, iqta, tribal and nomadic government systems 6) with all dlc activated you can see more mechanics, subject interactions, alternative history events (sunset invasion) and new eras to play in, however this leads to my first gripe with the game...  1) the DLC, so many DLCs, now first things first i dont mind the dlc in the game thought there is a lot im perfectly fine with the major add ons, however i think it is pure greed that after you pay the £15 for the newest expansion you have another £4 to pay for the new unit sprites and portraits that come with it! 2) not for those who want a complete historic experience, because as the game goes on you will see more and more alternative history events take place, like the norwegians taking england not the Normans in 1066. 3) to get the best experience out of the game i recommend the full game with all dlc, however this is very expensive so i recommend getting it from a discount site or in the sales.  Finally, this game is the most accurate medieval grand strategy game I have come across and I definately recommend it to anyone who likes strategy games, but as previously stated it is very expensive for the full experience so if you are a die hard strategy gamer i fully recommend the game, however if you are new to the strategy genre i would recommend a more welcoming game and a less expensive experience.",

            "review_text": "Our review begins in The year 1080- The Norman king Bohemund rules over all of Sicily.  Early in his reign, Bohemund falls ill, and it is thought that he will not survive. One fever-sick night, the king is struck by a sudden apparition: a strange man stands before him.   'King Bohemund, my name is David, ruler of England, ♥♥♥♥er of pigs, leader of the Conservative cult and the first of his name. I bring grave news'   Bohemund looked into the darkness through weary eyes, but even his plagued mind could distinguish otherwise. 'Thy mistakes himself sir, a fellow norman, William, rules England.'  David gave Bohemund a smug nod of the head. 'Perhaps in your time, but I rule many centuries from now. I have travelled through time to bring you warning of what's to come.'  Bohemund coughed, his body shook. At first he appeared not to hear, but then he said 'What hath gone so terribly asunder that thee hails me upon my deathbed?'  'You are not to die yet, king Bohemund. It shall be you that saves Christendom itself.'  Bohemund's eyes widened. 'What is this task thou sets before me?'  'The year will be 2016, the moral authority of Christ is failing throughout Europe, and greivious heresy has spread through the kingdoms. Yet the unstoppable tide of Islam advances.' David regarded Bohemund sincerely. 'Once again the Caliphs wage Jihad before us, yet no Christian coalition can muster.'   'Good God.' Muttered Bohemund.  'Instead the defence of the realm is left in the hands of a corrupt and oppressive puppet regime of Islam that goes by the name of: 'The EU.'  'Blasphemy! These be-eth lies thou puts before me!' The king cried.  'Alas, not.' Assured David. 'What's more, a terrible heresy known as 'Socialism' has rooted itself in our lands, and it is the work of Allah to be ascertain.' David paused, Bohemund looked at him with awestruck eyes.  'Together, the scourge of the EU and socialism have led our once great nations to surrender before The Jihad and allow open borders to the heretics.'   'But you, sir. Thy claimeth the king of England, surely you must lead the Crusade if no one else!'  'Not king, no, but I won't go into those details.' Said David. 'I am but a vassal of the tyrannous EU. They subjugated my once great nation near on half a century ago.'  'Alas. Alas.' Bohemund resigned.  'But all is not aloss...' David permitted.  'How so?'  'You, Bohemund. You must lead the Christians, as king of Sicily conquer all of Africa and crush the self proclaimed 'Fatimid Caliphate'. Only through your actions can the Dark Ages of the socialism heresy and tyrannous puppet empire of Islam, 'The EU' , be avoided.' David began to fade before Bohemund's very eyes.  'But David, how do I-'  'Do not fail me Bohemund. Do not fail your Christian brothers. You will know when the time is right.'  'But David, David wait!' But David was gone, and Bohemund was left alone in his chamber.   And king Bohemund followed his call to arms. Great swathes of Africa fell to Sicily, and it seemed that the terrible fate of 2016 was never to be. Alas, Mighty Allah stood by his subjects, and used the vile sorcery known to many as 'War ended inconclusively (Casus Belli no longer valid).'   It would be five years before Sicily's armies be ready to strike again, yet in that time much would change. The wrath of Allah did not end there, the 'Deus Vult' driven Bohemund was struck down by 'natural causes,' and history was doomed to the present which we see before us.",

And these are not subtle bugs that only come out when a thousand players are running through every function of the game, these are as basic as tribal revolts being unable to raise their maximum troops because they don't know how to call up vassal allies.  I've heard that CK has only four devs left working on it, I can beleive it. When they try to deal with problems that derive from underlying design flaws like North Korea mode they don't have the resources to change this game from a blobbing simulator so they take the cheaper option on constricting players into a narrower and narrower playstyle so that they can't see that the emperor has no difficulty.  I was promised a dynasty simulator, and now I have given up on ever getting that, and ever giving paradox money again.",

You're better off watching a guide on Youtube. 2) You don't need DLC, but several DLCs in particular do greatly expand the game- Way of Life, Legacy of Rome, and Sons of Abraham expand the options available to you in the core game, while other DLCs offer new start dates or the ability to play as a member of a different religion. Cosmetic DLC is mostly unnecassary, although you might want to pick up the Mongol and African Facepack when they're on sale since by default they share the middle eastern appearance which rubs a lot of people the wrong way. 3) The game does not shy away from the more brutal elements of history. Death and Disease are prominent. Religious Intolerance and Xenophobia is the norm. Murdering children who are in the way of your plans is a valid option. Marriage is a political tool, not a matter of love (Although circumstances can lead to a very happy arranged marriage for all parties). Female rulers are at a notable disadvantage because they can't lead armies and many of your vassals don't approve of a woman sitting on the throne. And yes, as the other reviews you see here no doubt mention, Incest is a thing, and even infants can be bethrothed to old men (Although you can't actually marry someone until their sixteenth birthday, so at least the squick factor is toned down). That being said, you can choose to be better than all this, and be a fair and wise ruler. Or you can run around aranging for little children to be somthered with pillows while cuckolding half of England's nobility. It's your choice.",

This is the game that has been holding my interest for years.  Nothing else has the same combination of things to do. It has the war and development of a grand strategy game, but also the personal development and relationships of an RPG.   What's more, there is always something new to experience. A game as a French duke clawing for power in Western Europe has a very different feel from that of a Viking raiding across the North Sea or that of a Armenian king struggling to survive a Muslim onslaught. Depending on my mood, I can set up a slow game of carefully constructing marriage ties and improving my demense or I can set off on a whirlwind game of conquering and plundering.   I came into this as a veteran of other Paradox strategy games, such as Europa Universalis (my previous favorite game, before discovering this one), but if you've never played such a game before, CKII can certainly be a bit overwhelming. However, this is also not a game you need to become an expert in all at once. Picking a minor Irish count, for example, can allow for learning how the game works, while picking a more precarious position can increase the challenge later.  I have played this game for years and I have never finished a game, because 'finishing' is not what CKII is about. It's about enjoying the experience. The people and families in the game truly make this game more engaging than any other strategy game I play.",

My son finally comes of age after a long period of time and after all the events and traits he's gained he is a battlegod ungodly good at warfare. In fact after a few small conquering wars of our neighbors of Saxony he kills several lords and best others in battle no one wants to challenge this guy to a duel as well.   Soon after Charlemagne united Francia after rebel wars for 50-70 years he conquered Saxony placing me in his territory while my depressed, werewolf, and former king (my dear friend) was temporarily in the kingdom to be released by rebels and we are split apart from one another. The king (Francia) begins to plot my demise after his brother lost to rebels (that lost him the throne and his titles as well as freed 1/2 of Saxony). My son gets to the age of 21 I'm bored of war/stuck with Francia a place of constant turmoil. I begin to sleep with all the Pagan neighbors from Germany to Russia. By the time of my death at the age of 61-62 (which I was seducing 16 year olds to 40 year olds) I have 21 children most of them claimed by the ruler of the country. I was a master seducer, master of the hunt (due to the fact of me commanding Francia's army as their main combat leader all the while of being under assassination attempts for 40 years). During this 40 years my wargod is undefeated and infact has abused the neighbors and enemies of Francia into submission thousands of vikings, rebels, invaders, and countless lords dead at the hands of my almight seducer of women/heartbreaker and killer of men. Oh and I also apparently 'robbed the craddle' as its a trait gained after getting to the age of 50+ impregnating queens and etc under 20 years of age.

Gameplay: Has a very high early learning curve. Sadly I felt like after I got a good hang of the game and played for a bit, I got bored just before uniting Ireland and felt like the game was lacking something. But then I'm not inherently a fan of 'grand strategy' games for that same reason, they tend to feel bland and unfinished to me. If you like other Grand Strategy games, you may like this one.  Graphics: Straitforward, nothing flashy here but it's not going for that.  Music: Solid, a good instrumental track that is probably the best part of this game.  Reason for not reccomending: I find it extremely unethical to charge $40 for a main game like this, which by itself feels very unfinished compared to similar titles I've played like Medieval 2 Total War. However, that would easily be forgiven until I realized that the rest of the game is behind $160 of DLC! This is unacceptable and represents everything wrong with the current gaming market. It sickens me that companies would treat their customers like cash-cows and after purchasing and testing some of the DLC myself... I wasn't impressed with how little you get for what you're paying for and feels like it should have been part of the core game. So ultimately I cannot reccomend this game due to the developer's blatant disrespect for their customers, and because the only way we're going to stop the gaming market from going further down this pit of DLC-heavy, content-light games is to stop paying for it.  And putting my money where my mouth is, I can't return this title but I won't purchase any more games from this developer until they stop doing this rediculous practice. They not only crossed the line, they went 100 miles over it and stepped on the gamers who support their work in the process.  That said, that's my opinion, I thank you for your time. If you found this helpful, I'm glad. If you disagree with me, that's your right.",

The excellent, tactical diplomacy and finesse required to build and manage a kingdom or empire is incredibly engrossing.  This says nothing, of course, of the immersion. I got the inspiration to write this review due to circumstances I just found myself in during a game.   I had a Chancellor who had been excellent at his job about the same age as my king. He was probably the sole reason I had been able to unify and maintain control over the kingdom of Ireland. He also educated most of the Irish Princes and anyone else I had at court who I thought had potential. As he got older, I replaced him with one of my talented sons but kept an eye on the guy because he was so skilled at diplomacy.  After my first successful invasion of Wales, I decided I needed a trustworthy and very diplomatic person to take over the first Duchy I had conquered over there. It wasn't going to be an easy job as the Welsh hated their conquerors with passion (so yea, I may have been caught successfully assassinating one of their Counts...). So I knew I was sending this old friend into a dangerous position.  But at the same time, I couldn't trust anyone else for the job. This was the only guy I could trust to quell rebellion in Wales and not turn around and attack me years later. So this lowborn peasant-ex-council-member, deservingly, became a Duke overnight.  But as a player, I found myself really hoping he would survive. Hoping that, not only would he manage to turn the Welsh anger away from my Kingdom, but also that he might thrive in his new fief and build his own dynasty.  Any game that can make me feel so part of it is worth its asking price.  Heartily recommend.",

But if you do make sure you watch some video tutorials on YouTube before you dive in because this is not a game you can just pick up and play - but is really worth the effort of learning it. The sheer amount of gameplay provided in this game is amazing.  The only issue with this game now is the sheer amount of DLC. I stopped playing it because I just couldnt not keep up with it and now that I am around 30 DLC short it stops me feeling like playing again becaiuse I feel like I am playing an incomplete experience. I know that isnt the case but thats how it feels. So in this case the sheer amount of DLC has put me off playing.  Same with EU4 as well actually. And would have to say I would think twice now about buying any future Paradox games for this very reason. Just cant keep up with all the DLC. If they honestly need to add so much stuff into the game after release then there is something wrong somewhere. And a lot of the DLC coming out is a bit dodgy lately it has to be said.  So this game is recommended for anyone who likes a deep Medieval strategy game and if you dont mind playing a certain faction (like Celtic or English) you can sort of get by on some limited DLC, but if you dont have a lot of money dont even think of getting into this game or any other recently Paradox game.",

There is a lot of aspects to the game that you will have to learn through experimentation, and ultimately failure.  Overall, the level of replay-ability in this game is almost endless. There are thousands of rulers that you can play as, and tens of thousands of special events that will make your play-through unique and different.  The level of satisfaction that you get from taking over major superpowers, and assassinating kings of nations is nearly indescribable.  There are many things that can be said regarding this game, and I suppose the only downside is that the battles that your troops undergo cannot be experienced in a 3D environment like the 'Total War' series of Grand Strategy games. However, I find myself auto-resolving 90% of those battles anyways, which makes the 3D battle aspect irrelevant in the 'Total War' series of games.",

And Jesus did it deliver. It is a sadist's paradise. The point is simple. To send your dynasty to the heights of fame and pulverize your enemies to dust. Along the way you'll have to commit the worst abominations known to man.   Don't have any sons? Wife too old? Murder her! First born son an imbecile? Murder him! Brother trying to overthrow you? Let him. Then when you capture him, have his eyes jabbed out, castrate him and have him rot in a dungeon for twenty years. Then banish him, if you feel like it.  It warms the cockles of my black, dead heart to no end. And you can do it for the good of your religion! No, seriously. Do a blot and you get to sacrifice a dude to pagan gods, for fun! Get it with a sale and for heaven's sake make sure to get the add-ons. There's nothing funnier than invading Rome with super-ultra-mecha-Sweden  Keep your eye out, there's an India DLC coming out soon.

It's a medieval sandbox that justifies the worst in you, while at the same time demanding your worst is justified.  A lot of these reviews make it sound like you can incest your way to destiny.

I'm currently stuck on a decision of whether or not to kill this one Caliph. Okay, so I joined the Crusade for Jerusalem, and the Pope granted it to me for my war contribution. Since then, I've been holding the kingdom of Jerusalem for about 20 years, right? So now, I see there's this one boy who has come to power, uniting all of Arabia under him. My only solace is that he hasn't produced an heir yet, nor does he have a wife.  'I can survive his reign, and push this out, but I'll love tens if not hundreds of thousands of troops and people to the wars that would need to be waged. Or, I have an open shot to assassinate him NOW, with no heirs. If he dies before getting a wife and kids, his Caliphate will shatter into a thousand pieces, and the leftovers will fight amongst one another, rather than focus purely on me. I can buy a hundred years to two hundred years, and all it costs me is one single child's life. A child who WILL try to push me out sooner or later.'  Notice I didn't say 'my character'. I said 'I' all the way through, and THAT is the greatness that is Crusader Kings II.

You will likely grope around in the darkness and barely survive, at first. Then the magic starts to happen. You learn how to properly apply your advisors, how to marry for alliance vs. how to marry for stats, how to get those elusive claims on neighboring territory, and so on. You will pillage the English coast as Viking raiders. You will make pilgrimages to Jerusalem, hajjs to Mecca, blood sacrifices to Kali. Feel like taking control of a lowly duke in Sicily and reforming the ancient Roman Empire over hundreds of years? Go for it. Unite the three great empires of ancient India and become Samrat Chakravartin? Do it. Play as William the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Charlemagne, Alfred the Great, Saladin, Mansa Musa, Genghis Khan - or play, like I first did, as a mere count in Dublin and work your way up to Emperor of Britannia. Or start out in Rus and form the giant Russian/Slavic blob to collide with the Golden Horde. My point is, if you're into history like me, you will be able to live out any scenario from the past and form it to your liking. Assassinate your children, marry your sisters (Zoroastrians I'm looking at you), seduce your Steward's wife, hunt mythical white tigers, launch crusades, throw parties. Conquer territory and cement your family's reputation in the history books. BUY THIS GAME.  A few tips - as big of a game as this is vanilla, the major DLCs are must buys. They are constantly going on sale, so don't buy them at full price - wait for a sale and scoop 'em up then. I'd recommend Sword of Islam, Legacy of Rome, The Old Gods, Rajas of India, and Way of Life first. Charlemagne, Sons of Abraham, and The Republic are also awesome, but not as crucial as, say, The Old Gods. Save Sunset Invasion for last, if at all.

Paradox is not at all shy about putting a lot of numbers on stuff and not really explaining them very well.  But if you can get past the inital learning curve, this is a very interesting sim. I am not sure I can actually explain why I like it.  Don't be put off by all the DLC. Most of it is optional additional music and art for units. The rest are expansions that add additonal options, like playing as Muslims or pagans. You can join a game with expansions enabled even if you don't have them. You simply cannot use the expansion exclusive features. For example, without Sword of Islam you can't be a Muslim, but anyone else in the game who does have it can.",

I like the challenge of trying to stay in control of a realm while trying to expand that realm and gain prestige and piety at the same time. The addition of baronies makes it harder to take counties (while making it harder for your enemy to take your counties) since each barony must be sieged separately.

My son who continued my legacy then formed the Kingdom of Wales. The Kingdom grew to take over the entire United Kingdom. A brilliant part of this progression is that while one King I controlled did nothing but ♥♥♥♥♥ and drink, the next heir to take the throne would then push on and expand the empire. Each character is different and exciting, some are up to the challenge of leading a country while others can be bumbling idiots.   This game is easily one of my favourites, and I would reccomend it to anyone who used to play risk as a child.",

The game has a horrible, clunky interface for you to manage your kingdom, or duchy, or whatever. Not that I could really tell the difference, because if you're not the king (or cultural equivalent), you don't get a border around your territory; all you can see are kingdom boundaries, so you have to click through all of your titles to look at the Region view and piece together your part of the world.  Once you've actually managed your kingdom and are waiting for things to happen, you... sit patiently and wait for things to happen. Even on 4x speed, once things were relatively settled, I ended up waiting 30 minutes for something of interest to happen - because you can't just declare war for fun, you have to have 'Casus Belli', which requires that you successfully procure a claim to a nearby territory (at a whopping success rate of ~5-10% per year, which takes about 15-20 minutes to power through), or that your neighbors are of a different religion. So if you want to expand, you need to hope that your chancellor can procure a claim for you, or that your plot succeeds (because hey, murdering your brother is cool), but that also involves waiting. So I wound up sitting there, waiting for the game to be interesting, and wondering why people loved this game so much.  Six hours later, having had to restart twice because my very young successor (sucks to not have a male heir immediately) did nothing while the Regent told me I couldn't do all of the things I wanted, like revoking the title some formerly-loyal vassal had when they formed a faction to team up on me and rebel. But, of course, the interface shows you none of this, because people plotting to rebel is apparently a minor notification, not major like some dude teamed up on you in a war you struggled to start. And when you do notice, you can't do anything, because even though the interface shows you the requirements to take certain actions, it reported all requirements met and STILL would not let me do what I wanted. Having to resort to Google to figure out why I can't do anything is bad design.  Not for me. And I don't see what it is about this game that everyone is so interested in.",

There is so much in it to keep tabs on (who likes/dislikes you... who do you want to like/dislike... who do you need to like/dislike?)  Keeping your Dynasty alive is your main goal, expand if you can but if you die without a direct heir, and thats the end of your game.  In one game I played a Saxon chief, and was assassinated in my 3rd year as ruler... no heir. In another game, playing a Serb Count, I married the daughter of a Byzantine Emperor and by some miracle of fate, SHE ended up gaining the throne and my Son became Emperor...  There is so much to keep tack of, its impossible to do so, the AI is great at creating its own goals and methods of getting rid of its adversaries, the game never plays the same twice.  Replay value is huge. The larger DLC's are great addons and each adds much more to the base.  I suggest watching Shen's tutorials on youtube when you get this game. I recommend this to anyone who wants to play something more interesting than 'building armies, biggest wins'... who you place as your generals and who does what in your court, really counts! Out of all the Paradox Clauswitz style games (Victoria/Europa/Hearts of Iron) I recommend this one above all others (I've played the older Crusader Kings 1 as well). This game is complex, but not too hard to figure out, but will take a bit to master... however you can only influence so much, right? If you have a good imagination, you'll love this game.",

You need to pay for DLC simply to play as certain factions which in my opinion is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t considering the base game is already $40. If you notice the price of the game along with all the DLC it amounts to roughtly $160. Charging your customers simply to play as another faction, or getting the ability to customize your character is nothing more than the work of a bunch of greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who are milking you dry for content that should have been in the base game and not sold as a DLC. It's understandable to charge for add ons that extend the campaign years but this is absolutely ridiculous. You can't even own retinues without the DLC, while the AI can ofcours do whatever they want since the content is there, its just been kindly locked away for you by the devs. Do not buy this game unless its on sale and you can get the full content for $40, otherwise be prepared to spend around 20-30 more bucks just to enjoy most of the features.",

Character creation allows you to do what you will with any given starting character, from making ugly weak dwarfs to brilliant strong madmen. Count to Emperor, you can take many positions and generally do a great deal from any of them. However, that's about as far as my praise goes.  This game most shortly put is an offense to whatever senses of logic I poses. It confounds me so to no end, as I have struggled to find any enjoyment in this game beyond being a subjugate duke or king below another person in multiplayer and for extremely limited periods of time. The sheer massive lists of persons throughout the world to suffer is only one among many of my problems with this game that exemplify the core problem of this game: tedium.  Your own family will constantly complain or try to kill you if you refuse to give them half of your personal titles. In some parts of the world, random armies of holy warriors from one cult or the other will invade you relentlessly. The passing-on of titles from one heir to the next is completely unintelligible in some systems. Buildings are essentially pointless to invest in, when you could just spend that money on mercenaries that are generally lead by their own badass commanders. Technology is pretty much pointless outside of anything that expands the number of titles you can hold or those that curry the favor of your lessers. War is simply a numbers game, if you have a few thousand more men than your enemy you win; unless you do something incredibly stupid like crossing the Gibraltar or between Ireland &amp; Britain. Generally really, the UI is abysmal and finding or doing anything is a chore on top of all of the above.  One of the most criminal things about this game comes down to its lack of a soul. This game feels like nothing but a series of lists of very temperary persons bound to die in short order. There is no reason at all for me to care about anything and nothing you do is satisfying, not even taking territory on any scale. Everything is so short-lived and fickle in value, there is no way I can find much interest in the aquisition of anything. At best I can find joy in raiding and murder, nothing else lasts so it plainly feels pointless.  If you're attentive and can find entertainment in stabbing the same king of the same country in the face long enough to become emperor of the universe or love navigating one of the thickest poorly constructed UIs I've ever known, you may well like it. You see, where others like some of the people who wrote the highest rated Steam reviews may perplexingly be overjoyed to spend dozens of hours watching lets-plays or reading wikis to undstand a single game, I certainly don't. Any game that takes dozens of hours to gain the most basic understanding to navigate or effectively opperate in is—no matter if I have somewhat figured it out after my own prolonged experience—signifigantly flawed and I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone unless they're a masochist.",

The worst part - It is impossible to understand what is happening and why it is happening.   From my experience, you will spend most of your time looking at a map without anything happening, the animations are non-existing and the game seems to not put any effort in trying to entertain you. Most of the time you will just pass through years waiting for something interesting to happen.   Wars are not won by strategy but by having bigger numbers, it is exausting to look at such numbers, and like most part of the game, it will not tell you how to win a battle. I have found that at least in my experience there's no way on customising your army in a way that it can have an advantage over the enemy, if it does, it is hidden on the game like everything else. I must say that Risk has a more emotional and fun battle system than this.   The random events caused by things such as hunting, seem to be few (I encountered the same random event 3 times in a row) and very similar, your decisions have no suspense as the game already tells you what will happen if you choose to do A or B, the great story-making atmosfere I heard about this game is not here and it feels like the game only care about accumulating stats.  Weddings are the worst, I spent 30 minutes trying to find a suitable wife for my son because the game doesn't offer you a list of potential and interesting characters that DO want to marry your son. What happens is that you keep looking over a bunch of random-generated worthless women on a giant list with stats. (which already tell you more about the person's qualities and defects than Facebook, making all the suspense about choosing a good wife non existing as you will already will know who's good and who's bad). After finding one that is of the same hierarchy and unmarried, you will be very happy to know that the person rejected your offer, and you will again go back to the list.   This game seems like a narcissist who only cares about himself, he doesn't appear to want to be played and makes no effort to try to make you entertained or to understand how he works. I warn all people that this game has no meaning on it's own, only if you create your own story, like other players seem to do, and if you try to discover and content yourself with the poor mechanics the game has, you will like it. If you expect a game that gives you something, that will guide you in someway and offer you an interesting strategy challenge, whether it is at a war or a wedding, you will be disappointed.   I must admit that I have played a small amount of time, but it because I am hoping to get a refund to spend on a game that it's more welcoming to newcomers than this. It's not the complexity that makes the game hard, but the fact that it doesn't explain you nothing and will not care to do so, even if you play on very easy you wont know how to play the game and lose.

While buying the base game in itself is not that expensive Paradox tends to keep making new content about twice a year, while it's very nice and adds replayabiltiy it brings about three major problems and one minor one.  1. Every year you will spend $30 bucks. 2. Not buying it means the version you are playing will introduce features that make the game feel off as new mechanics are built around content that is blocked off to you. 3.As the mechanics change so do a lot of the rules, so suddenly you find yourself in a situation where you go to bed with a stable empire in a game you've been playing 50 plus hours from 860 - 1330 only to find yourself in a massive civil war because the numbers where arbitrarily changed.  The game has a few unbalancing issues, it's really hard at the beginning until you start snowballing. Unfortunately the mechanics to try alleviating the snowball effect (liberation armies, adventurers) will either crush you because you were too small or they will be an annoyance at best (sometimes a too frequent one at that) There is little to no reward for facing these challenges. It does however let you occasionally loose, sometimes you get beaten, sometimes your plans fail and it's not game over (Unless it is however one of those adventurers then your hosed.)  The games positive aspects are pretty amusing and I could spend hours talking about the time my son assassinated me to take the throne or you skillfully killed, manipulated and set up that sweet moment. The AI does occasionally goof but the moments where things come together far outshine it... Unless you're playing small... Never, EVER play small, start small maybe but never stay small. Unfortunately there are often times when you're just sitting there waiting and twiddling your thumbs... it seems to become less of an issue, (With DLC of course) yet if you're playing as a Catholic or Muslim surrounded by others of your same faith you could be spending ages with nothing to really do... The Arch Duke of God let me do something fun before this person dies.   Combat is pretty much a numbers game, although there are times when tactics and troop composition DO matter so it's something to pay attention to.

I could not get into this game at all, especially since the map has no option to see your holdings other than diplomacy mode which changes as soon as you click it. I like 'big picture' games with country vs country...this is like a lifetime channel game with only a lite emphasis on warfare and has way too many characters I don't want/need to care about.

(My gameplay):  I bought the game under the pretenses that Paradox Interactive (Mount &amp; Blade) where a respectable game company with immersive gameplay and really puts the player's input first. Naturally my first mistake was trusting them. Imagine this, you see yourself as a fan of Checkers, (average stategy game) you've always been a fan of strategy, it's simple, fun and keeps you on your toes, so naturally when someone comes up to you and offers you a game of Chess (Crusader Kings 2) you'll assume from past experienec that you will enjoy it, be capable of playing it and of course be able to understand it. NO. This game is like real life Chess, you're ♥♥♥♥ scared, there's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s coming at you from all angles without explanation.   Why am I being attacked? Oh yeah that's rigjht, my allies are turning against me because I'm not doing anything because I don't know what the hell it is I'm supposed to be doing because the tutorial explains nothing, for the menus it has 50 million different topics and slides, for economy it only has one slide explaining that making money is good and losing it is bad, BUT HOW DO I MAKE MONEY THEN?!   The practicality of the 'turn' system is another SERIOUS fail, you don't press 'end turn' like any other quintessential strat game, no, you simply press 'play' and the game progresses by itself day by day and of course it takes forever so you speed it up but before you know it by the time you've blinked and inhaled that next bit of oxygen that you've had your eye on for awhile, your being invaded by angry John Doe... you're already dead, I couldn't even finish this sentence.   (Overall):  This game is appaulingly bad, it seduces you in like one of the girls from the James Bond films' makes you ready to go then throws you in the deep end with just your tight spandex underwear with Jaws and Oddjob both whom have digested Viagra and desire your shiny backside. Listen well and listen good. Unless you wish to go home with an odd pain in your butt that you can't quite remember what happened the night before, don't buy this game.

It is diverse, replayable and accessible - you don't have to be seasoned veteran of grand strategies to enjoy this masterpiece, yet if you want something really challenging, there are lords and countries which present you with stiff competition from the very start of the game. Ironman mode will make the game even more ruthless if that is what you will.  The DLC are well worth their price, you can play the game without them if you want to (the only difference is that non-christian lords, appropriate bookmarks or key mechanics of the DLC are locked away and thus inaccessible by the player), though I strongly recommend to wait for the game being on sale.",

While many rts type games allow city/empire building and detailed battefield control, CKII provides a rewarding experience from the necessity of developing and maintaining dynastic bloodlines.  The necessity of developing technology in order to unlock building progression helps maintain a realistic evolution of your demesne. And while many games allow attrition to become an achilles heel, you will be hard pressed to churn out massive amounts of troops - making your strategies far more consequential. Throwing all your troops into the fray unwisely will result in catostrophic results, as the time required to rebuild levies may take longer than the time your enemy needs to defeat you.  Education, Marriage, Technology, and Councilors become your greatest weapons in acquiring new fiefs and solidifying your dynasties chances of survival. CKII effectively allows expansion through both martial or political means.   I highly reccomend this game to fans of the historical time period and those wishing to master the destiny of dynastic rule.",

The main difference is that you play as a dynasty rather than as a single person. This means that things like marriage, lines of succession, diplomacy and intrigue become far more relevant. There is still plenty of warfare in there but it does not dominate like in traditional strategy games.  There is a massive amount of replayability here as well. You can start in different time periods, play as different characters and crucially, different levels of character. For example, dealing with inter-county intrigue as a French count gives a very different game to trying to unify Scandinavia as the king of Sweden.

The amount of DLC is a bit over the top, but you only really need some of it for some types of games (like playing as a Maharaja) and the cosmetic and music ones can be ignored.

But this game offers a truly fun experience for everybody else, too. Playing it for the drama-mongering, whether political, carnal, religious, or otherwise, rates quite highly. If one of your vassals is bothering you a whole lot, have them killed. If that is too risky, arrange them to be married to someone with the plague. The level of detail and creative freedom is deceptively high. You're left to create much of the nuance yourself, however. This isn't a title that holds your hand much.  Unfortunately, sometimes the level of detail and micromanagement can be irritating. It would be nice if you could delegate more to your inferior, but it's by no means a game-breaking annoyance. Of course, with any complex game, there are issues within the game here and there, though never enough to break immersion.   So, fellow kings and lords, fulfill your birthright and rule like you've always wanted. Just hope you aren't born disabled.",

I had realized that this game is a game that makes you think. The tutorial was there to help you get started, not be proficient to play the game all the way through. It took me 4 or 5 play through to make it a full 100 years without struggling. The game forced me to learn to how to play it and play it right. The first time I had to quell an independence revolt, I barely survived. To add to my struggles, my neighbor decided to use a de jure CB on me, right after and took away a duchy. A few years later my Step-Brother killed me...  I would recommend this game to any person that is interested in grand strategy games where just about anything is possible ( even killing a tiger if you have the right DLC). I would suggest to download the demo first and try it. This game is not for everyone, but if you are the right person you will enjoy it.

You, send this off by carrier pidgeon or catapulted peasant or whatever you use for communications!'  'Right away, sir! Wait, you should look at this before....'  'Are you telling me, of all people, that you are disobeying me? Right here in front of all my subjects?'  'No sir... I'll.... your liege, please forgive me.'  A WHILE LATER...  'Sir, we have recieved word that your marriages are both agreed upon, congratulations!'  'Excellent! We'll prepare the wedding now! A feast! A party! We'll.... why are you looking at me like that?'  'Well, sir, your wife to be and daughter in law. Your lady is only 4 years old, and your son's lady is only 2.'  'Oh jesus... jesus hell... what the... why didn't anybody tell me!'

            "review_text": "This game... It's hard for me to describe. It's incredibly interesting, fun, but brain smashingly deep and slow paced. I'm just going to be frank with you. This game, isn't for everyone. In fact, it's not for a lot of people. Even HUGE fans of video games who have been playing for decades and love seeing new things are going to be put off by it. So why am I rating it as a must buy? Because if those problems don't bother you and you're willing to give this game a shot it's really rewarding.  First things first: You must, and I can't stress this enough you MUST play through the entire tutorial. The tutorial alone will probably take you an hour or two and by the time you're finished you're still going to be unbelievably horrid at the game. But that's the price you have to pay to get started in this title. Once you've finished the tutorials it's time to head into the game itself.  Second: Choose a smaller nation to start, I'd suggest Denmark. Don't do what I did and go straight to England. Because 10 seconds into the start of the game you're going to be invaded by William the Conqueror, and he's going to smash everything you have and, well, conquer the entire island. (Hence the title, you don't earn a title like that from being a nice 'live and let live' kind of a guy) From Denmark you'll have a chance to really test your hand at the game and expand your influence slowly. Play that nation for a hundred years or so to get a feel for things and then move on to something more interesting and start over with a larger nation and more issues. I'd suggest France, big armies, lots of influence, and no invading Normans (though you'll lose a lot of your Nothern lands because of William. You can take them back later)  Third: Try playing as France for a while. If you're anything like me, you still don't know exactly what your doing and ♥♥♥♥ off the nobles so much that the kingdom splits into 4 different smaller kingdoms in a state of perpetual civil war. Time to start over again.  Fourth: Start again as France. This time, do what you need to do to keep your nobles happy and in line. Maybe take some time off of politics and declare holy war on the Muslims living in Spain. (Pro tip, if you can get away with it send the armies of the nobles who don't like you so much there to conquer everything. Their men will die and if they rebel you can crush them that much easier)  Fifth: Now that you've spent about 13 hours learning how to play the dang game it's time to try to build a lasting legacy. Welcome to Crusader Kings 2!  Pros:  -Holy information dump Batman! I'm not kidding when I say this, but you are going to learn a TON while playing this game if you have the mind to. From wikipedia articles detailing the histories of the nobility to tems like casus belli you will walk away smarter for having played. (I told you video games would make me smarter mom!) -The characters in the game, as they are, actually act according to their stats and traits (perish the thought) -Moral dilemmas all over the place. Do you punish that rival duke by taking his lands and making everyone else hate you for it, or do you just throw him in prison. What do you do with your only son who is an imbecile and your current king doesn't have much time left to live. etc.  Cons:  -There is soooo much to remember and keep track of that the barrier to entry of this game is huge. Imagine attacking a castle wall that is: on fire, covered in poisoned chainsaws, and patrolled by every single boss from the Dark/Demon Souls franchise armed only with a copy of this months Cosmopolitan and a tube sock. This game's barrier to entry is worse than that! -Art style is very basic. It still looks good, but if you don't enjoy staring at old maps for a long time this isn't the game for you.  All in all, you need to give this game serious and careful consideration before you put down one penny on it. For some people (maybe, 15-20% tops of the gaming crowd) they are going to have a great time with this game. For everyone else, move on, nothing to see here.",

I spent days playing this at a time playing smallest faction’s imaginable. Turning an Irish county into a sprawling Empire. Not so great if you’re looking for great graphics or blood or any type of instant gratification because there is none like in the total war series. Everything is long and drawn out but all the more satisfying when you finally achieve the new goals you’ve set for yourself. Although it does have loose guidelines you have to abide most of the choices are made for yourself. Very restricted freedom in the best sense of the word. Politics are key and declaring war is a task in itself. This is no cakewalk and you will find yourself wanting to pull your hair out.

This is the game you want to play if you want to be able to:  1. Kill all your rivals and enemies  2. Marry your daughter/sister/mother  3. Conquer the world (right now only India, Europe, some of Siberia, North Africa and the Middle East are conquerable, but there are mods for the rest of Asia and Africa)  4. Steal everyones wives (Pagan only)  5. Reform one of the Pagan religions (Norse, Slavic, Romuva (Baltic pagans) and some others)  6. Restore the Zoroastrian faith and become the Sayoshant (Zoroastrian Jesus)  7. Restore the glory of Rome and retake the Imperial lands (only for Greeks)  8. Mend the Catholic Orthodox Schism by kicking the Pope in to the Mediterreanean (Orthodox characthers only, for obvious reasons, also, it's too bad you don't get to kill the Pope afterwards)  9. Play as a Muslim, become the true Caliph and kick the Christhians out of Europe and into the Atlantic by starting the Jihads  10. Be the Mongol Hordes and play as Genghis Khan himself and fulfill his dreams of conquering all of Europe  11. Fight the Mongol Hordes and get your ♥♥♥ kicked by insane doomstacks of Horse Archers  12. Play as a Republic and defeat the other republics and wrest final control of the seas and swim in infinate amounts of gold  13. Play as a Jew, retake Israel and restore the Temple of Solomon  And much more!  Recommended DLC owned by me:  The Old Gods (Needed for playble Pagans and a start date of 867)  Sword of Islam (needed for playable Muslims)  The Republic (Needed for playable republics)  Sons of Abraham (Needed for improved Catholic mechanics and playable Jews)  Legacy of Rome (Needed for all things Roman)  Other recommended DLC:  Charlemagne (Needed for playing in 769)  Rajas of India (Needed for playable Indians of Indian religions (Hindu, Buddhist and Jain))  Way of Life (needed for more RP)  Not recommended DLC:  Sunset Invasion (Unless you really like to get ♥♥♥♥ed by the Mongols I won't recomend it since it essentially creates another Mongol invasion, this time from the West and with boats all the way from the New World)  Other DLC:  All music packs (Pretty inexpensive, but not neccesary for anything really)  All unit packs (Same as music)  CK II-EU IV Converter (Not neccessary unless you really want to make your game span from 1066/867/769-1821 (which would be a little less than 800/1200/1300 years and also buy EU IV) which would take even longer, considering that a single game of CK II from 1066-1456 takes a really long time",

An alliance with the king of Svipjod could be cemented through a marriage with the princess, who was admittedly the niece of the would-be groom. The marriage went ahead, and an inbred freak was born of the union.  I thought little of this family shame until through a series of Viking raids gone awry, all of my original ruler's sons died as maimed cripples. The inbred five-year-old inherited the high chiefdom with near-zero stats, survived until adulthood, and then spent his dead uncles' loot on building an army to conquer his neighbors and form the kingdom of 'Danmark.' Later, when two subject houses were embroiled in a blood feud, he called them together in a mead hall and tried to leverage his status as an inbred freak to curry empathy and make peace. The room erupted in violent chaos, and he had to settle for escaping with his life. Eventually, the circumstances of his birth would catch up with him, and he died of genetic failure in his forties, but he passed on as the most prestigious member of his dynasty to date. 10/10 - would wincest again.",

The only aspect of this game that in my point of view is terrible is the DLC and business Strategy being employed for this game by paradox,  first of all I think it is the only game that offers 52 DLCs! the Collection which doesn't even has all the available DLC is 160 dollars when not on sale (trple that amount and you can buy a reasonable laptop)  now to buy all DLC separately it is 56.99 dollars on a 75% Sale (multiply that by 4 to get the original price which is $227.96) oh plus the $40 for the actual game! The DLCs themselves are full of ♥♥♥♥ like a shield and armour for a specific nation or religion costs 2 dollars oh and they charge an extra 15 dollars just for you to play with an Indian or Pagan Faction these kind of things should be expected to come as free upgrades and background downloads (what are we made out of money, this is just high way robbery!!!!!!!) I was allowed a certain budget by my parents for this summer sale and hence could not afford to get the entire dlc collection as I also wanted to purchase other games. so thanks to the geniuses who masterminded what in my opinion is the worst business strategy of all time and thanks for ruining a great game that I have been unable to enjoy to it's fullest thanks to you. I usually don't wtite reviews but for this game and as I am a huge fan of Paradox interactive ever since I played Hearts of Iron 2 so I had to write this maybe paradox interactive can wake up and fix this foolish problem which had no reason to occur in the first place to solve it as they owe it to us their fans and to this great game.

            "review_text": "CK2 is on the whole great, but it's certainly an acquired taste; even among frequent grand strategy genre players. The game has seen so many updates, bugfixes, rebalances, mechanics removed and added and extensions to the scale of the map that it's important to acknowledge the differences between what it is now and what it was years ago.  What it is now is basically the closest thing to A Song of Fire And Ice: The Video Game that money can buy. Note I'm using the name of GRRM's book ludicrously successful series and not A Game of Thrones, the ludicrously successful TV series. Because if you find an overwhelming amount of detail too much, this isn't going to be a good fit.  In any given situation there's many different, often mundane looking factors that can utterly change what you've planned, and others that can suddenly render them irrelevant or an impending crisis. This is true for a lot of grand strategy, but CK2 seems to take it to a whole other level making it something you'll find appealing or abhorent.  You could spend a long, long time deciding who to marry your heir off to, only for them to die in suspicious circumstances; you could spend years slowly eliminating the unity of a neighbour's alliances only to have another invade his lands before you can, leaving you the prospect of entering a far larger, costlier and probably less decisive war for the same reward. Or that might be the goal all along, and once one looks like they've the upper hand, declare war on both and conquer them whilst they're exhausted and their allies won't have anything to contribute.  The game has weaknesses; in explaining core mechanics like how dynastic succession laws work examples aren't provided and there's no preview of what their far reaching effects would be (making it punishing for a new player to learn the hard way how things work); in late game the performance of the engine drags a bit. Some mechanics, such as the choices offered by the seduction focus from The Way of Life DLC seem imbalanced compared to what the alternatives are, and there's some quality of life overdue.  I recommend the game. The DLCs are generally good; I don't think The Sunset Invasion stands up to repeat gameplay, and I think the EU4 save importer is niche. The Old Gods and Charlesmagne DLCs allow for earlier starting dates but they greatly extend the length of the game and have very slow build-ups outside of a few characters of interest.",

I find its best to watch some basic tutorial videos and switch between that and playing, even if you mess up constantly and have to restart. The only way to learn is to play around and go to a video or wiki resource when you find something you do not understand.   All that said if you are interested in the roleplaying aspect of being a king, or even non-roleplaying aspect of feudal governance you should check this game out, things like balancing the inner workings of your realm as well as requiring a legitimate cause to go to war make this game feel a lot more authentic than games like civ, which is great in it's own ways.

You could lose your demense or titles or start off as a count and become king. There are no real objectives, just what you want to do. Every playthrough is different.  It is a very difficult game starting off and I would recommend starting off as a count or duke. Ireland, or newbie Ireland is recommended as the best place to start and it is true. Very little vassals to try and please and you get the idea of how warfare works, and how to get claims as you cannot just invade or attack anyone, you need a valid CB.

There is just so much excitement once you get into it... first true game, started as a count worked on up to a king. Held my land well until the succession when all hell broke loose. Half of my vassals rebelled for independence. Thought I was done for (since the neighboring kingdom decided they wanted to take my throne all at the same time) but luckily a few vassals remained with me. Lost a few wars, had to surrender some land to the neighboring king, but after a few years I was able to respond with a vengeance and restore peace and re-unite my kingdom. So gratifying and enjoyable!  Get this game!  ===  The above was my review 4 years ago...  Tons of expansions later and this game is still a go to for me. Every penny has been worth it and I love the amount of work and dedication Paradox has put in, changing and enhancing the game overtime.  The mod scene is also excellent, and if you are looking for something that will scratch that Game of Thrones itch then this is what you are looking for.  It is Grand Strategy and will take many many playthroughs to start to grasp just about everything you can do (even today I find new ways about doing things).

You could play exactly the same character every time and never have the same game. There really is only one way to describe this game, EPIC.  The expansions are great, I particularly recommend getting the Old Gods expansion which allows you to play as a Pagan character and pushes the game right back to the 9th Century. I love how all of the religions are modelled and the mechanics of playing as that religion makes gameplay unique for each one.  The things you can do are endless. Fancy playing as the Byzantine Emporer and refounding the Old Roman Empire? How about being Ghengis Khan and leading your Mongol Horde to conquer Europe and the Middle East? Try being the head of a rich merchant family and build trade routes to gain money and political power. Play as a Viking warlord and pillage and raid the coastlines of Europe or simply play as a count and try and build up your families power base through clever politics and intrigue. Some of the best games I have had is when I have started as a lowly count with one territory and slowly but surely, sometimes over hundreds of ingame years become a world conquering Emporer.   The game is incredibly deep and lasts for hours and hours of play time. I feel like I have barely scratched the surface of the possible things I can do. Despite the deepness I think it was relatively easy to learn to play, but that may have been because I already have many Paradox games such as Hearts of Iron 3 and Victoria 2 and found these much harder to get into.  If you enjoy history I heartily recommend this game. It has taught me sooo much about Medieval history whether that is just skimming through the various starting times to look at the politics of the known world at that time or by reading Wikipedia articles about some of the more famous characters in the game. Even if you don't enjoy history, don't be put off, the game is not educational and doesn't ram history down your throat.  Whats more there are some brilliant mods. The Game of Thrones mods is a must for any fan of the series. They have recently expanded the mod to include a whole new continent and the scope, just like the vanilla game, is incredible.  In summary this game is bloody brilliant and well worth every penny I have spent on it.",

At full price you would pay around 170 US dollars for everything when not on sale, so I recommend that option only to the player who had to have it all now.  Major DLC (1-5 on sale often, 6 - first sale I've seen was yesterday off-site, 7 - new) 1. Sword of Islam - allows playable Muslim rulers 2. Legacy of Rome - Byzantine Empire and Orthodox church 3. Sunset Invasion - alternative history with invasions by Aztecs 4. The Republic - Merchant Republics 5. The Old Gods - Vikings, Pagans, start year can go back to 867 6. Sons of Abraham - Abrahamic religion upgrades, Judaism added 7. Rajas of India - Indian rules and new provinces  Minor DLC - largely cosmetic and music.

In single player almost any small player (county or dutchy) near a muslim AI is pounced upon. Also, if you have the DLC that allows you to start in 867 be aware that Jorvik and several Norse positions start with 5K plus troops that cost them ZERO to maintain, they will steam roll anythng next to them and there is nothing the neighbors can do about it. The other rather glaring problem is the difficulty settings which are next to meaningless. It's one thing getting a hollow victory, or in the case of this game survival, on the lowest setting. It's something else when you have to resort to the command screen via tilda to just survive on the lowest setting. Personally I think the single best thing Paradox could do is fix the difficulty settings so that on the lowest setting the AI is hampered by stupidity.",

            "review_text": "A wonderfully in-depth mix of RPG, strategy and history. Start with a chosen character, from the lowliest count to the most powerful emperor and choose a time in history from the Dark Ages to Medieval, and build a dynasty whilst you re-write 5 or so centuries of history depending which expansions you own. The game is based on the relationships between thousands of characters, and through marriage, scheming, intrigue and war, you can make your mark. When your first character dies - and there are a vast array of ways to meet your maker - you will continue as your heir. The game plays out as a pausable, real-time system, with events popping up that give you little multiple-choice vignettes to add colour to proceedings. RTS fans will likely find the combat simplistic, but the real beauty of this game is not how good any one of its systems is - it's the way they combine together to make an epic story unfold before you. Your dynasty will have a rollercoaster ride of rising and falling fortunes, but as long as you have at least one province, you're never out of it - in fact, there's nothing more satisfying than clawing your way back from catastrophe and the game does a fantastic job of making failure fun.  There's a wry humour throughout, and CKII is far from a joyless history lesson. Not only that, the level of replayability is astonishing. The choice of rank, culture, size of nation and historical start date gives a vast variety and the expansions, often discounted, widen this even further, as well as adding new rules and scenarios. Mods are also available and even a (rather expensive) save converter that lets you carry a completed CKII game into Europa Universalis IV. The forum community is nice and helpful and the Paradox website also contains a lot of AAR's of people's games - worth a read to get a feel for the gameplay.  I can't recommend this gem enough to anyone who enjoys strategy, RPG or even RTS type games, and wants something different, or to anyone who likes Paradox's other efforts.",

All of a sudden, I died from old age. Now everyone hates me and they form factions and my kingdom is splintered by civil war. Then I die again to assassination. Now my land is strewn across my two uncles and everyone wants to depose me. I call in my allies, somehow win subjugation of Norway, but with new Norwegian independence wars and the ongoing war to install my uncle ( I killed my other one and got some of my stuff back), I surrender to my uncle and let him sort it out, which he does. I try to assassinate him to inherit everything back, but by co-conspirators blabbed and now he hates me. So much, in fact, that he challenges me to a duel. I am at one less martial ability but things are going so poorly I figure why the hell not and somehow I win, kill my uncle, and regain the kingdom of sweden and Norway. Bottom line, if you like strategy games, this is a must buy. You will sometimes get screwed over but the stories created along the way are what make the game.

It's not a game about winning, it's a game about telling a story.

Sorry, one of your rivals just successfully arranged for a servant to poison him, leaving you with no male heirs to carry on your name. Arrest him, fabricate evidence of treason, or set in motion plans to assassinate him in kind. If you're really feeling devious, send agents to begin making false claims on his lands and titles, give it a few years, then go to war, take his lands, and banish him to the Wall, or even just let him rot in prison or execute him and his family (Lannister vs. Reyne style), and wipe his legacy from the world entirely.  So many things to do. It's insane.  I don't think I've even played more than a few hours of the standard game, the mod is done so well.

In the end I went on youtube and watched some video tutorials on the very basics of the game and these helped me grasp it a bit, and as soon as I did I was hooked. The fact that I'm still learning about the game after so long shows its depth, originality and pure gameplaying focus, as opposed to snazzy graphics and no depth.   If like me you like a challenge, a really deep, beautifully thought out strategy game that is also a lot of fun (I assissinated my mother in law, just because I could, how much more fun can you get?) then you really have to buy this masterpiece.   So many variables, you can start as so many different characters without even buying an expansion and each game would be totally different.   I think my girlfriend left me last week, I should probably stop playing soon and check to see if she left any food in the cupboard.   10/10   ",

In single player things can occur that make these characters with random abilities, stats, and dispositions to behave like real adversaries and allies. Here's a case example.  I was the king of Poland, or rather the Piast dynasty ruling over poland. My characters (the succession of kings) had all been known for their piety, for ousting baltic heathens - taking their land in the process - and helping in Crusades. Come the fourth character in this religious dynasty, and I notice my successor is a bishop. How fitting! But then he arrives to me one day with a book he found inspiration in - he's now converted to a heretic faith and wants me to join him. Blasphemy!  Well we can't have that. So I politely and forcefully excuse him of his duties as Chancellor, as well as limit his influence in every way I can. He hates me now, but everyone else likes me. Things stay like this for a number of years. What brought about a change is I realized I could never get him to convert back as long as he hates me, so I looked at his aspirations (to become Chanellor again), gave him a bit of land and so on. This caused outrage in my other vassals beyond any benefit I saw, even for my son, and so I felt I was stuck with him until I die. But what's this!?  The king of Hungary, looking for a prestigious husband for her daughter, asks for my son's hand in marriage (it wasn't weird back then). Of course I'll marry him off and get him out of my court! Make it a matrilineal marriage so their children inherit her name rather than mine. I don't want my dynasty to be known abroad as a bunch of Lollard heathens. What a relief now that that's settled. Or is it...  Years later, I look at what's going on in Hungary after one of their many civil wars. What?! She's the queen! And my son, who still hates me with a passion is now king of Hungary? It can't be! The sneaky (later to be known as 'the cruel') ♥♥♥♥♥ made her way onto the throne, and they are both plotting to kill me! Me! Janislaw the Pious, who walks the path of God!  Hungary being too much of a military power to conquer, I could only wait and hope their assassins didn't find a window of opportunity to kill me, until the Lord took me to heaven himself.

Warmongers may find something they like in CK2; however, the heart of the game is in its politics.  Combat has improved since release, with various traits for your generals and the occasional reworking of how levies work, but battles often comes down to who has the bigger stacks. It's not a bad system, but it can be frustrating at times.  What the game lacks in combat, it makes up for it in the raw emotions it can invoke without you realizing until it's too late. You invest money and time mentoring your genius eldest son to a brilliant strategist to ensure that your heir (the future king) is a great leader, only to have the boy die the year after he comes of age, before he has produced a son of his own. Now his younger brother, the detached priest is next in line. Ugh.  The game lacks a good tutorial, but there are plenty of strong tutorial 'Let's Plays' series to be found on Youtube.

I've played Total War and Age of Empires my entire life, and would have considered myself a strategy player. However, you cannot be considered a true strategist until you have played Crusader Kings II. This isn't about the long game, it's about the.... very long game? Whatever.   Unlike other RTS's, CKII is not a simple case of 'numbers equal victory' (though numbers always help). This game is about laws, marriage and intrigue at heart. I love the teachings of Machiavelli and this game embodies the friendless nature of Medieval Europe. Armies will give you security, but intellegence and foresight can give you the world. Never in any game have I experienced so much joy from gaining so little land through manipulation and guile. There is also a lot of ejoyment to be had once you put down a massive rebellion and then extract revenge on the lords responsible (heads will roll).  There is also an educational element that people overlook. I honestly couldn't name any regions in Hungary for example. Now I can name loads of places in Europe and Asia Minor I had previously never heard of. It's a nice feeling when you sound intellegent all because you played a video game. You also learn a tonne of new phrases such as 'de jure' or 'casus belli'. These phrases can be incorparated into everyday conversation which makes you look well clever like Steven Hawkings or something.  My only gripe with this game is it is impossible to justify and explain to other people. You cannot convince friends why this game is fun, The game essentially consists of manipulating feudal laws to gain land and accrue power which admittedly sounds boring. It will be boring for some, yes. But if it sounds even the slightest bit interesting to you please give this game a chance. It will change how you view games in general. Video games do not need bells and whistles to be interesting.  Just a warning. This game is not enjoyable for the first 5-10 hours depending on how quickly you pick it up. But once you do the rewards are huge.  You don't have a social life anyway.    89.7/100.   Would highly recommend.",

I really enjoy Classical and Medieval history, so with a name like 'Crusader Kings', this game caught my attention on YouTube. I saw a Let's Play someone had done of it and I was actually caught off guard by the learning curve. It was unlike anything I had seen before. I come from the likes of Sid Meier's Civilization series which doesn't have as much strategy involved with it. Don't get me wrong. Civilization can be tough, but that's for another time. After a couple months of watching Let's Play's of this game, I picked it up in October of 2012 and this quickly became one of my favorite games of all time. The idea of having a family dynasty and playing it out 500, 600 years is incredible (with The Old Gods DLC).   For those not familiar with the game, you play as a ruler of a county, duchy, kingdom and/or empire and basically do what you want. Try to aquire more land buy fabricating claims or pressing someone else's claim. Try to maintain what you control and keep your vasals in line. Play as the Byzantine Empire and mend the Schism between the Catholic and Orthadox Churches as well as restoring the Roman Empire (with the Legacy of Rome DLC). There are many possibilites and many ways to play. It's also worth noting that I consider this game very much character driven as opposed to being country or nation driven. There is so much I can say about this, but I don't want to ramble on about it either. I would say if you like strategy games, enjoy history, or at the very least, enjoy games that make you think, I would at least give this a spin.",

How funny!').  CK2 is one of those games with a high skill cap. You can be learning how to do new things quite a few hours in, long after you've left the tutorial. Part of the reason for this is that the game has a lot of content (and Paradox keeps adding new things), another more prominent reason is that a lot of it isn't intuitive. The vast majority of tricks to doing well in this game are emphatically 'gamey' and prioritise winning in a fashion that seems at odds with what you'd expect. The game doesn't explain this -why would it?- and so it takes a long time to absorb the information.   Fortunately, learning how to play the game is fun! It's tremendously entertaining to see your profiency expand over the hours of playtime and to watch the map painted in your colour as you get better and better. However, once you feel like you've hit that cap, and at 300+ hours I feel like I'm coming close without having acheived an awful lot, the game stops being nearly as fun.   One other problem with this game is the sheer volume of DLC that essentially creates two versions of the game: the release one, and the DLC one. DLC appears to improve every aspect of the experience: most of the graphics and music, for example, are locked away until you buy it. You are also totally unable to play a large amount of rulers without those upgrades. This is significant, because if you become committed to it, you'll probably find yourself wanting to basically pay as much money as you did for the game, *again*. At the very least, you'd realise that your game will astronomically benefit from it, which in many ways is ridiculous.  With that said, I've definitely found it fun. And with the amount of time, even spending money on DLC, it's been worth the expense. I'd reccomend it to anyone who enjoys a good map-painting experience. And I think that particular jibe is justified, because it covers so many more genres than incest-simulator could do.",

I am the vassal of an overlord who is the king, and he is a vassal in turn to an emperor. You get the idea, you can choose to start anywhere in the heirarchy of any nation but I wanted the challenge.  I was single, so I guess I should marry someone and start my dynasty. Hey! Theres a neat interface here that you can use to search for a person of either sex, sorting by noble or common blood, culture, religion, and a heck of a lot of other neat switches. (I wish I had this when I was dating!) So there are no adults or children of nobility or other cheiftains that would fancy me. So I finally figured out how to marry a common-born courtier... who has amazing stats and is some other cheiftains' spymaster?  Huh.  So lets try that then. Oh. I did marry her. And she left his court to be with me and in my court? That's acktually pretty awesome.  Huh. Now I have a message that some of my courtiers want to get married?  Oh yes. Commence Operation Brain Drain. I'm going to take all the best men and wimmen folk from my rivals.  Mind you, the game does get a bit tedious at times. But you get to be the puppetmaster!",

I guess depends on how you want to play).  Want to be a kind, benevolent ruler loved by your people? Want to be a back-stabbing ruthless tyrant? You can be either one or combinations of the two in this game.  It took me a couple plays to get into it, however, as the simplicity of the representation of units on the map turned me off initially. But there is so much going on besides just the military aspect, and the options you have to customize your house/kingdom are very numerous.

The player chooses a lord that can hold a range of titles (baron, duke, king, and so on) across the Old World. This lord can be unknown to history or a famous ruler from a desired era. As the dynastic ruler you will experience random life events that will shape your character’s progression. Spend time managing and maintaining the happiness as well as ambitions of members and vassals of your court. Elect the people of your court to five different council positions that affect the state skill modifiers of your realm. As the old saying goes, surround yourself with people smarter than you and success will follow. Just be careful who you trust...  The dynastic leader you will have the ability to forge alliances through marriage. As well as fabricate claims on other lord’s territories. The game has a robust claims and diplomacy menu for the warlord or plotter of any nation. When your character dies you resume play as the heir to your dynasty.  Crusader Kings II has a good music selection that changes depending on your ruler’s starting zone. There are no cinematics and the storyline is what you make it. In fact the random events and traits your character picks up their their life is what makes this game. Crusader Kings II gameplay features are robust. A few examples are plotting and bribing to commit assassinations. Managing kingdom laws and church opinion. Raising levies and troops to carry out your lord’s wars. Also genetic matching of couples and tutoring of child characters to effect their traits as an adult.   There are so many features to this game I simply can not fit it into a short review. This is the attraction and downfall to Crusader Kings II. A fun political/strategy game that has great mechanics but a bit of a steep learning curve. I find the game to have good but not great playback value even after purchasing a few campaign DLC.  Pick up Crusader Kings II if you have ever dreamed of living the life of a medieval noble. Climb your way up the political ladder and take your crown.  8/10 I recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "This game is not for the faint of heart of those who lack patience. It has one of the highest learning curves in a Grand Strategy game. This ain't Civilization. You've been warned.  Crusader Kings II is a Grand Strategy game from Paradox Interactive. It was released in 2012 and has been very heavily supported with various expansions via Paradox as well as mod support.  You don't play as a country in this game. You play as a dynasty in the Middle Ages. You choose a person and have to rule over your land as well as make sure you have a successor to your dynasty. You may start of as a minor feudal lord, a petty king, a king of a large country or an emperor. In this game you have to learn how to manipulate the political landscape, as well as engage in large scale wars and run your county/kingdom/empire.   The game is not the most accessible game to those unfamiliar with previous Paradox Grand Strategy titles. Even those who would say they are Civilization experts can find themselves overwhelmed by the sheer amount of info that the game displays. There is a tutorial campaign, but watching lets plays will definately help new players figure out the more advanced tactics that can be accomplished in the game. I personally reccomend watching LPs on YouTube by Northernlion, Arumba, MathasGames and quill18.  To help describe the amount of detail you can influence in this game, there is a genetic system as well as an education system in the game that I'll breifly explain. You're children will gain the genetic traits of yourself as well as your spouse in the game, like a sickness of an affinity for intelligence. This also includes statistics to attributes not unlike a tabletop RPG. The education system allows you to have your child taught different behavioural triats that boost or negate those stats. This is important to be aware of because in the event of your character dying (whether it be by poison in your wine, being killed in battle, or of old age) your child will be your successor. This isn't always the case due to different succession laws that can be enacted, but in the end, your dynasty has to survive.  The game's interface as seen on the store page takes place on a map of mainly Western Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. (Eastern countries like India are included in DLC). Time can be paused and sped up at any time during the game.  You will have to be wary as factions can cause an uprising if you run your land like a tyrant, or even if a morally ambiguous party who would see to take your throne from you. You can however use ditry tactics as well, such as bribery, assassination, plotting individuals againts one another. Sometimes you get away with these acts, sometimes your involvment gets discovered, harming your reputation.   The game itself has no set campaigns, which works to its advantage as it is a historical sandbox. You can influence the entire world in ways that aren't historically correct but still plausible, like taking over Constantinople causes the Crusades to start hundreds of years before their historical date.  This game will take time to learn, but when you do learn it, Crusader Kings II is one of the most rewarding titles to be on the PC in a very long time.  If you find games like Civ too easy, give this game a shot. It's on sale often as well.",

If those sorts of games sound fun for you, you will need to find some time in your schedule.  *Ever= So far. if you could manage cities on a level akin to sim city, more soap opera/daily life stuff in the interpersonal area, and a more total war style view of battles, this game would be even better...",

            "review_text": "So this is probably my most played single player game ever, and it's the one that I always go back to when I get really bored. Its main appeal is probably the ability to rewrite or attempt to recreate history. I have all of the big DLC's and some of the rinky dink ones. The only really bad one is Sunset Invasion (it's just dumb). I'm kind of a history buff, so that's probably why I keep going back to it. Obviously I really like the game, but I also see some issues.  Like most Paradox games, it's got a pretty steep learning curve, but this is definitely one of the more approachable Paradox titles. Very rarely do I find myself in a situation where I'm unable to strengthen my country even as a one province realm (okay, if you get invaded day one by your huge-♥♥♥ neighbor it's gonna be rough, but by-and-large...) unlike in EU and especially Victoria games.  Sometimes they mess things up on patches; I remember one time they changed some math to do with retinues but forgot to update numbers for Merchant Republics so for a while you could get a ridiculously large retinue army. Merchant Republics are still pretty OP for player characters, but that's another story.  One of my favorite features is that many historical characters have links to their wikipedia articles (e.g. Charlemagne, but also most king level characters and above in starting scenarios, and the more notable dukes and counts).  Obviously the revenue format kinda sucks, but it's just the way of the world now, I guess. Sometimes I feel like Paradox should be a bit more rewarding to folks who buy DLCs piecemeal (there were times during sales where I could have bought the entire game with all DLCs for less than the remaining DLCs would cost during the same sale, but I guess they still got me to buy them, so, whatever).  I have some legitimate gameplay criticisms, but I can't remember any specific ones right now. I will probably update this later when I remember them (if that can be done). Overall Paradox has done a pretty good job improving and balancing the game with updates (for free).",

Anyway... it's highly priced, so either wait for a sale or get it with extreme caution (I got it before the two latest dlc's Charlemagne and the Way of Life came out - so I got it simply because I could live my dream of being a viking: having a great berd, sacrificing to the Old Gods while having a few horns of mead AND raiding the Brittish Isles times and times again (all these things at the same time), then loot some neighbors (like the finno-ugric people, slavs and balts) take over more land form the kingdom of Sweden and, if the Gods will, the Empire of Scandinavia.

The game takes a bit of time to learn, but not as much as many grand strategy games - and as with most Paradox games there are both easy and hard places to start. Gameplay is exceptionally variable, with events constantly coming up to haunt you (I married my least important son to a countess in Italy for a minor alliance... a decade later and he's my only heir, and she has corrupted him into a monsterous excommunicated idiot), and the future always uncertain*. The events seem very intuitive and reactive, and every aspect of the game feels like it is impacted by your decisions (from the claims that people look to, to the balance of power of religions, to the genetics of your heirs - the game responds to your actions and gives you feedback: your family might even start naming children after your custom names).  If that doesn't interest you... there's still an extremely robust modding community with tons of alternate scenarios and events.  * If you get enough power, or are very good at playing certain aspects of the game, you can pretty much cruise through poor leaders (or make it very unlikely to get poor leaders). Unless you're really good or really powerful (in which case, start over and challenge yourself with harder starts or trickier goals), though, your best plans and hard fought gains can evaporate overnight with rebellion, assassination, disease, and Mongols.

The buttons are still present, so if you have the vanilla game and have been trying to earn a retinue and haven't been able to, this is why. (A little annoying when game makers put in buttons for DLC content right next to other regular game functions and don't tell you what's up)  If you're a Game of Thrones fan, there's a mod for that. And it's quite good. Lannister 4 life.  If you don't use console commands, the start of this game may be extremely frustrating. It takes waaaay too long to make any amount of decent money. Meanwhile, everyone else in the world seems to have enough money to wage war on you or hire an assasin to kill you. Even if you don't want to get into altering people's traits via console and whatnot, I highly recommend the 'cash' command at least. It's the only way to quickly get out of the initial slog and on to bigger business... like trying to close that Gate to Hell.   It's unique. It's smart. And it doesn't give me motion sickness.

And after Sancho's early death at age 47, and Ferdinand's death at age 41, Sancho 'The Hunter' II was the last of the Castillian Jimenas. Because Ferdinand instated Primogentiture in the kingdoms, Sancho II had 2 sisters. One of them married to the King of Navarra, Luis 'the Fat' I. Queen Blanca (the sister of Sancho II) popped out a child, Alfontso Luis Jimena, Prince of Navarra, Castille, Leon, Galicia, and Portugal (speaking of Portugal, Duchess Urraca of Porto was always plotting against ol' Sancho II). After Sancho II died at the ripe old age of 58 after years being a maimed cripple (His father died after being in a coma, yeesh), Alfontso became Alfontso I of Navarra, Castille, Leon, Galicia, Portugal, and eventually Andalusia. Meanwhile, Aragon, Barcelona, and Denia (yes, a county) were all prominent figures in this Hispanic tumble. After dying of illness at age 38, Alfontso I left the kingdom to his half-Moorish son Luis II of Navarra. After years of negotiating and 'negotiating', Luis II of Navarra because Luis I of Hispania. Next stop, Emperor of Mali. But Luis I died at age 55. Then Alfontso I came along. he got the Kingdom of Mali, but still nothing. Edigo 'the Bold' I was bold enough to conquer Mauritania, but it was Alfontso II who got it. He was the son of Edigo I and Queen Orlaith 'the Wise' I of France. He soon randomly got Aquitane and he was crowned Emperor of Francia. His son, Edigo I, Prince of Asturias, died before being crowned, so at age 21, Alfontso III became Emperor of Spain, Mali, and Francia. Feeling pretty dickish (Alfontso was a cynic to be reckoned with and he almost lost the empire to his many relatives), named his son Charlemagne. After Alfontso III died of poor health at the age of 41, Charlemagne 'the Just' I started the 'Remove Kebab Program' to remove kebabs from Africa. That had to wait, because the Spanish-Scandinavian Civil war started against Empress Thorborg I of Scandinavia and Emperor Charlemagne I. Emperor Charlemagne succesfully installed his 15 year old son as emperor (the war started when he was ~8). He was happy with his wife, Queen Helena 'the Fat' I of Poland, but went insane. He became emperor after my 74 year old emperor died. Rodrigo 'the Usurper' I was emperor rule for a WHOPPING........ 10 months and a day. After that Charlemagne 'the Great' II (yeah, Charles the Great the Great), removed all the kebabs, getting down to Abbyssnia. After dying at the age of 69 ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°), Alfontso IV became king. He removed some kebabs, some filthy pagans, but the biggest things he did was make Estifania, his daughter, Queen of England, conquer Ireland, and conquer Scotland. He died at 58 in a comatose state. Now I, Emperor Alfontso V, did 1 thing, I killed my heir to get Hungary and to become Emperor of Carpathia.  Overall I amassed 128,000 prestige, ruled over all of Western Europe except for a tiny piece of France, Never lost a county, made the Seljuks our ♥♥♥♥♥, became the most prestigious dynasty, became related to the all of the last independent Christian kingdoms,and owned 8 empires (not counting 1 mod empire). All out of of a 4 province kingdom.   ∞/10 would be a Jimena again.",

However, there is a big catch. If you've gotten this far then you've probably seen there is ALOT of DLC for this game, hundreds of dollars of DLC. You are not going to want to play this game without a lot of this DLC. This makes this game a huge investment and you'll probably not be anywhere close to mastering it at the end of your two hour refund period. Do at least half a playthrough before buying any DLC.

And after much ♥♥♥♥♥♥, staking and maiming completed his task. But no, Yusuf was not content, he gazed upon the Seljuks and saw ♥♥♥ he wanted.  Raising his warriors he invaded the Seljuks and slowly ate away at their territory. His sons led the armies while he watched and was pleased with his work.   Soon the House Basayev was feared throughout the Muslim world, a pious, rich family wielding more power than the Sultans themselves.   Then it all went ♥♥♥♥ up.   You see Yusuf soon died and he had sons. Lots of sons. 7 to be exact.   Here is their tale: 2 died in battle against the remnants of the Seljuks.  1 killed himself  2 died from suspicious circumstances.   Which left 2. Alp and Boris.   Boris was strong and stupid. Alp sickly and smart.   Neither could stand the other and so civil war broke out over succession.   By the time it was over the seljuks and afghans had reclaimed lost land and Alp was back to the beginning.   He soon died and left asickly homosexual son.   So ended the Basayev line.

            "review_text": "This game is my significant other. The one I go back to when I'm bored with the latest AAA title... the embarrasingly large number of hours on record stand testament to that.  I could give you a run down of one of my campaigns. There was the time I played a Norman Count recently installed after the Battle of Hastings. I played it nice with William, was made Duke... then overthrew his son as soon as he died and crowned myself King Edmund (Blackadder). There was the time I rebuilt the Roman Empire, reunified the Christian Church then imported the Save into EU IV and took Rome to the New World. There was the time where I built a great Welsh Empire that emcompassed all of Great Britain then took the fight to the Mongols. Then there was the time that I encountered the Persian Joan of Ark who led my armies to victory in India... but I won't go into details of those, instead I will tell you why you should grab a copy of CKII as well as a few reasons why you might not want to.  The Pros: *CKII is a very complex game that gives you an unparalleled level of freedom to shape your dynasty. Along with the usual diplomacy and warfare your character will encounter all manner of interesting random event and can embark on all manner of interesting personal quest - erect a runestone honouring your mother or seduce the King's wife then convince her to help you murder him... or dump her, seduce her daughter and catch sypholis. *The game is very well supported by Paradox and there is a constant stream of new content (some of which is free and some of which you need to buy). *If you do manage to get bored the Modding Community has created some truly exceptional pieces of work that will completely overhaul the game. *Offer the French King up as a human sacrifice to appease the Norse Gods. *If you like Diplomacy this game models it in a far more satisfying manner than any other game I have played. *Capture the Mongol Khan in battle. Then castrate him and send him back to his people. *This game will run on most PCs. *Claim the throne... then get murdered the very next day.  The Cons: *CKII is a very complex game. It has a steep learning curve. *Getting a complete copy of CKII is not cheap! Paradox has released a lot of DLCs since this game was released. *If you love Total War style cinematic battles, CKII does not do that. You have no direct control over your generals. You can watch them and see what strategies they are employing which is often quite fun but which can also be irritating when you watch your troops massacred through the flagrant incompetence of your commanders. Applaud as your massive longbow volley devastates the enemy ranks, then cringe as your general charges his own skirmishers then hesitates at a crucial moment... and suddenly everyone is running away. *The game will slow down towards the end-game as it follows the lives of the thousands of characters who are living, dying and murdering their way through Eurasia and North Africa. If there are too many it can become a little unstable.",

Crusader Kings II which from now on will be referred to as CK, is a game with a simple objective but a very complicated road to that objective. The main and primary objective is to make your dynasty/family last as long as possible while getting a high score. You can achieve this goal by killing other people and claiming their thrones, conquring more lands, marrying all of your chhildren and yourself, and many more that I would be here for a long time if I listed all of them. There is also the added complication of disease and conqureing countries such as the mongols and the aztecs (provided you have the right DLC).  This game is primarily about diplomatic stratergy that can aid you in further wars which are generally reffered to as the crusades (thus the name). You can make allies by being an alround nice person. You can steal peoples wifes, imprison their children, imprison your own children and alround ruin alot of lives.  Lets get into some pros and cons   Pros: Historical Fun   Cons: Takes you life Takes your money Destroys study life Hard to learn Rediculously annoying Oddly compelling Doesn't support Intel Graphics Cards  Even though the cons severly outway the pros, I still would recommend this game, even though I don't have a huge ammount of experience at the point I write this review (8 Hours), I can thoroughly say that this game is a good expirence and my hours will definatly increase.  The overall verdict is that this is a good game for anyone who enjoys complicated games and has a great time reading everything that pops up on the screen, gets peeved at the little things, and overall has no problem with loosing every two seconds                    #BetterThanEU4",

This game conveys that in an interesting way, sometimes gripping.   Bad points. Can be a time sink. Fem bias.  But they are generally outweighed by lots of fun and laughter. Probably the most stressful element is gavelkind succession rules, which seem to require more time to master than I've put in so far (about 150 hrs). This basically means that if you have more than one kiddie then the goodies you've built up during a reign, or a whole succession of reigns, get divided up into separate states. And you don't get the choice which one to play in the new generation. So you can begin to see why some folk knight this game Sir Infanticide. It can be gut wrenching.  One of my more successful runs came close to unifying all the English duchies into the much sought-after kingdom, but then that awful warning sign bobbed up that there was no successor of my line, so the game will end when my current archduchess character dies. Entirely my fault since I've been artlessly given away in youth into regular patrilinear wedlock. There was a niece of my house and some distant relly with no lands. But when the warning came i already had four or five kids counted as some poxy frankish house. What can you do? Its just destiny. But then one of my sons dies young by arbitrary whim of the presiding Clauzewitz. Hhmm. So I arrested the two other sons. Hhmmer. It's really easy to murder any prisoner. So I did. Meanwhile I'm transferring almost all my lands and titles to the older relly. Preferable to give them to the niece and marry her off matrilinear, but the game won't allow her to receive titles so young. Male bias for sure. However having reduced the reigning family to one daughter, it turns out you can't imprison a daughter. Even if she's all that stands between UK empire under your dynasty and who knows after that (thewhole world ??!) and the game ending, there's a little message insisting she's immune from even a day in prison, where she obviously belongs. WFT in spades after arresting and slaughtering two sons, plus a continental husband tied to some very powerful thrones there. Lots of threats, lots of revolts, all evaded or put down by a massive standing army i don't dare disband. Well eventually my evil duchess persona dies and the game ends well shy of my just deserts. If this doesn't demonstrate fem bias i wouldnt know what would.  Nevertheless I'd recommend this game. You just need to spend some time, and tears, getting to grips with the rules. There's a lot.",

It is complex vivid and colorful, and will keep your attention generation after generation. I have bought several of the dlc as well, and i think that from what i got out of it, it was worth the money. This game needs a couple of the DLC to be its best, which is one of the downsides. When I started playing, there was only europe and north africa, but the map has extended out to mongolia and as far south as India. The world is huge and the options are endless. I will say that the mechanics are hard to master and very confusing at first, but once you learn, not only does this game become awesome, you can basically play any other paradox GS game, because they have similar interfaces and mechanics.

With over 100 hours on it, I can proudly say i'm addicted.  I came to this game, hoping that Paradox had made a good historical game and they exceeded my expectations.  Here are my positive and negative views on this game:  Pros -----  - Addictive  - Different combinations of gameplay  - DLC Mechanics [I'll come to this later]  - Playing your favorite nations.  - Playing important bookmarks in history  - De Jure Wars  - The Council  Cons ----- - Bad Multiplayer [I'll come to this too] - Assassination Attempts - Not many Cons  The DLC in the game is quite bountiful, it spins the whole mechanics you have learnt in the vanilla and makes you spend more hours on the game trying to get how the game works.  A good example is Conclave DLC, which provides a whole new set of laws for you to toy with and a Council which you have to always please.  The thing that I am disappointed in the most with this game is the bad multiplayer, where your friends go out of sync randomly. My solution for anyone finding this problem is to use LogMeIn Hamachi and go to Documents\\Paradox Interactive\\Crusader Kings II\\Maps then delete the caches there. You will have to do this every multiplayer session you do, have fun!   Verdict: Crusader Kings II is a game that is worth your money when it is on deal or not. It can entertain you for hours on end, wether you get home at 3 oclock in the afternoon and want to unwind on a Friday night sweating on this game, or if you're just going to play an hour or three with your favorite country. There are many ways to toy with this game.   My advice is to purchase the game and any DLC that changes your gameplay in an Autumn Sale or Christmas Sale, it is worth your money.",

Basically, this is a machiavellian simulator: you play as a ruler starting sometime after 769 (with Charlamagne DLC) and plot, murder and war your way to power until your dynasty is extinct or unlanded or until 1452, whichever comes first. If you don't like computer games at all (in which case I'm unsure why you're reading this), but love interactive maps and history, it's just about worth buying the base game (+Charlamagne and the Old Gods DLCs) just to spend hours on end alternating between looking at maps and reading about religions you'd never heard of, famour characters from the period, or historical developments that occurred during the era.

Do you you want to restore Rome to its former glory, can do. Do you want to rule all of India as its Viking overlord, if you want.  Like many Paradox games, though you may start with heroic intentions, you will inevitably become the villain. You are the duke of of York. Your reign will be just and fair. Though you only hold one county and your neighbours are eyeing up your land. If you lose your land your just reign will be over and the people will suffer. You decide to fabricate a claim on your weaker neighbours, for they are surely doing the same. You press your claims through war. War was inevitable you tell yourself. Now you have consolidated your land, you are safe and peace will follow.  Scotland attacks, your incompetent king and his infighting vessels are useless. You fight as best you can, but your meagre duchy can not hope to stand against an entire kingdom. The war is lost and Northumbria is lost to the Scots. Your land can not be safe as long as a weak king rules the kingdom. You use the fact that your grandfather on your mother's side was the king and start a faction to press your claim. With the help of your fellow vessels you place yourself on the throne. Finally their can be peace.  You die and are replaced by your son. Your vessels are less than pleased. They start factions to limit your power and overthrow you. If they succeed all your work will have been for nothing. You blackmail your can and assassinate the ones you can't. Your vessels are split and powerless. With your internal affairs consolidated, you prepare to neutralise the Scottish threat once and for all. Over many wars and decades you chip your way through through Scotland. To prevent a unified Ireland from ever becoming a threat you conquer them as well. Now with your, vast domain, you crown yourself Emperor of Britannia. With your strong and unified empire, no one will invade. No one will threaten your long fought peace.  The Umayyads have conquered southern France. Their empire now stretches across all south western Europe. Christendom is weak and dis unified. Within a generation they will have conquered continental Europe and become unstoppable. You raise taxes and prepare for war. The peasants, distraught at the extortionate methods used by your steward decide to rebel. Though they fight valiantly, they are no match for your well trained army. While Christendom falls the pope calls a crusade for Jerusalem. It fails utterly. You decide to take things into our own hands. You name denounce the papacy and put forward your bishop as the true pope. With a quick and one sided war you conquer Rome and replace the pope with your bishop. Now the papacy is restored, but as a vessel of your empire. The Muslim threat is still ever present and peace is still not secure.  While you focused on the papacy your vessels have grown strong. Though they do not openly challenge you as of yet, it is only a matter of time. You invoke the power of your newly vassalise pope and excommunicate them. With little opposition you imprison them and redistribute their land. You are still to weak to fight the mighty Umayyads and decide to first unite the remaining European Christian kings under your might. With a few fabricated claims and papal sanctioned invasions you conquer Germania northern France. Your new vassals attempt to rebel, but they are replaced with loyal friends. The peasants rebel against their new overlords, but they are quickly put down. Your ready your massive army and call a crusade for Aquitaine. The war is long and brutal, countless people lose their lives, but in the end you are victorious. Though you face much resistance from the common people you gradually conquer the rest of Hispania. Now you are safe, now taxes can be lowered and the people can prosper, now there can be peace, but the Byzantine Empire is growing awfully strong...",

The game has a rather steep learning curve if you're not familiar with Paradox Games.  At times, info and the impact of your decisions are a bit difficult to anticipate. Notably, when you get into tricky succession (ie : usually, when you're about to lose a lot to someone out of your dynasty), it's difficult at first to determine how you can prevent it, even if you can prevent it... or who is going to inherit if your change your law. Succession, being a big part of the game, could be better handled with better interface display. It's better to manage once you get a sense of the succession laws and you handle your dynasty carefully (you have less tricky situations).  War and battles is handled at a basic level. You move your armies, you watch it fighting. You move your army to a county, you watch your troop besieging each castle and town. Your action on the battles themselves is limited to chosing the leaders at the center or the wings. Pick the good leaders, pay attention to their troops and the leader's traits. The game has a snowball effects during wars when, facing a relatively equal enemy, the first battles are often decisive. Once you start winning, the opposition becomes weaker and weaker, so you win constantly and so on.  And then, with the practice, you'll be able to manage your kingdom better and better from the start. Leading often to mid-game where you can dominate all your neighbors easily, if not half Europe (or more, depends who you play). The consequence is the end of the game is really easy. Now, it's not an easy game from the first session you play. It becomes easier the better you are at it. Not a big surprise. But for some players, the game may show its limits  CK2 is still a satisfying game. Replayability lies much more into the many starts you can have. You have all the european dynsaties, minor lords and all, to toy with. Play pagans, christians fighting to defend Iberia, irishmen, try to rebuild the roman empire, play a count and work up to king or emperor, play various counties, duchies, kingdoms, empires, play various cultures, religions. You can play match-making in your court and weave dynastic succession, or conquer everything by the sword and hopefully still hold it after the conqueror death. The game replayability lies in its very sandboxy aspect.  Now the DLCs.. It's a difficult topic. Some of them are offering a real value, some others are cosmetic. Pay attention to player feedback about 'content DLCs'. The more recent DLC have a debatable value in terms of content, relative to their price, or relative to what the game will become.  CK2 is a great game and deserve to become a classic of strategy games. It's going to keep you satisfyingly busy during many many hours.",

Thanks Arumba!) and you will not be disappointed.",

Then one of my vassals rebelled and immediately died so I ended up fighting a bloody war of nothing but pitched battles in the fields against his 9 year old son. I spent the rest of my life, and my son has spent many years of his reign trying to find a way to revoke the county from my now culled into line vassal. I recently managed to imprison him only to find that my plan tom marry into the title again had worked and the current count was my 3 year old grandson.    I revoked the title and put it on his uncle, my second son. It took me a while to realize I had no reason to have a 3 year old relative in the oubliette.  This all happened in the first 7 hours.  If any of these things sounds at all interesting or entertaining, you need to get this game in front of your face holes IMMEDIATELY. 10/10 would imprison my toddler grandson again.",

Absolutely love the DLC's (but I did by them all on sale) because they add so much to the game, especially the custom ruler expansion... creating and moulding your very own dynasty is immensely entertaining, and the different religions make the game so much more varied. I guess what I'm saying is that it's a well made game with plenty of replay value, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys this type of game.",
