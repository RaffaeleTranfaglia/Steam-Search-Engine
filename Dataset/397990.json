            "review_text": "I'll be honest: my first impression of this was very negative. The game just looks terribly generic. The lazy graphics could have been done by a 6 year old. But when I gave it a try I was surprised that the actual gameplay is pretty neat. It controls perfectly, the bosses have very different patterns and most of the weapons and upgrades are useful. It's also quite challenging and addictive. The art style keeps growing on you the longer you play and the dialog in the final level just made me laugh. Best of all: it's free now! So give it a try.",
