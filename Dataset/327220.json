I wanted to finish the game before I write review, but I overestimated my skills, meaning puzzles will keep you busy for period of time :)  As for graphic and sound, they are beautiful and most enjoyable, story is fun as much as can be.  I really do not have anything negative to write about this game, it is perfect.  If you are in point &amp; click adventures, you must own this.",

I have a number of the Daedalic games, ever since I purchased the Deponia series during a Steam sale.  This game is very very good. It is cute, funny, and entertaining. Even though Anna is a young girl, her character is believably strong and brave.  The puzzles are not incredibly difficult and the few mini games that do exist are relatively simple. The story is not unique but it is delivered in a heartwarming way.  What I would recommend is picking up the game before too many walkthroughs are released. This game is well worth the playthrough, and I plan on playing through again to hopefully 100% the achievements.  My only gripe is the bonus prologue playable game. It is great from a storytelling point of view but it is hardly interactive beyond holding the left and right arrow keys. Watch it for the back story but don't expect anything more than a few minutes of 'play'.",

It is currently 4 am and I feel fairly satisfied yet heart broken but left with a funny taste in my mouth. The whole story up to the end was great with interesting characters and an engrossing plot. The finale, however, was a little lacking with all the build up we had before. Don't get me wrong, I had a blast along the way and really liked the 'open for interpretation' ending, but DE wrapped it up too quickly to be 'absolutely satisfying' by leaving a few subplots unanswered (fingers crossed for a sequel). Overall, I would easily recommend this game, along with any Daedalic game.",

I didn't know a lot about it, but just the trailer and images I saw got me interested to see what it was about. Now, I've finally tried it, and I must say that it is an interesting and rather unique story like a classic fairytale. But first, let's talk about the game itself.   Plot",

But then I started reading into things, like the post-credits dialogue, the difference between being pure of heart and being clever, the contrast of fatalism and free will. I'm not going to spoil it, but I realized something. The theme of this game and the way that it's executed through the story just might be genius.  Edit: Just had to run back here to say that it also has one of the best depictions of the devil that I've ever seen.",

            "review_text": "Game is fine but have few major flaws which make it hard to recommend.  1. Main character is too plain, too saint and too boring. Her innocent cute antics are ok first few minutes but after a while you just skip over her lines to avoid headache. And you stack with her for the major part of the game. It really kills the joy as adventures are mostly about good mix of puzzles and story/dialogs. It was much more fun to play a part of antagonist's childhood instead of main hero quest line. The situation is worsened as Anna's side-kick - bear-boy is as docile as she is.  2. The story is rushed and abrupt, it feels unjust and ending is done in 'lets just wrap it up quickly' way. I think it was one of the worst endings I've ever read.  3. Puzzles are not polished enough and sometimes unable communicate properly what you are supposed to do. But mostly they are fine, though I don't like when you are not allowed to take items until some events happens. It really throws off your awareness about what you can use and what is just decoration items.  Overall game is not bad, first part is quite meh, second part is interesting as story start to shape up but than sudden ending without much explanation kills everything good in it.  On positive side I must note that controls are good, no long runs, no long animations to wait for, solid stuff.",

            "review_text": "Not recommended because there is no 'maybe'. Anna's Quest is a nice little Point&amp;Click game about a girl with telekinesis. The problem is the clunky interface and there is almost no intuition to solving any the puzzles. You end up random using items together and on the background hoping for something to happen. For example there is a rat holding a key, you can't do anything to it when you first see it, and later you can't interact it with it - so what do you do?   You combine mold found hidden under the carpet with paint to make 'cheese' then exchange that with the rat (the rat doesn't talk btw)  . Most of the puzzles are like this and it's annoying. It doesn't help that there are many background objects that can be interacted with but do nothing [except confuse and/or waste time]  It's a shame Anna's Quest is loaded with so much unfun because the art is nice and the story is not bad. There are much better child-friendly Point&amp;Click games like Harvey's New Eyes (although there are comic deaths) &amp; Night of the Rabbit, or Detective Grimoire. Anna's Quest is only recommended if there is a sale.",
