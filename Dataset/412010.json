Pros -Ok music, probably gets repetitive -They mix up the type of gameplay (but it really isn't ever fun) -Bright an colorful graphics (but they are still bad even at 2k)  Cons -Bad story telling -Terrible gameplay mechanics -Let me just reiterate, TERRIBLE gameplay mechanics -Boring  Would be a mediocre $1 game on a smart phone. Maybe 50 cents to a dollar on steam I would buy it again and get the achievements.  I am returning this btw. It ain't worth the $4.68 I spent on it",
