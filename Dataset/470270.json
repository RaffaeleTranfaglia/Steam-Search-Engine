            "review_text": "Small fun game based around a really cool concept of an infinite runner, where you have to split your tribe and use your abilities to solve different types of obstacles.  At first, it's often going to seem like you're losing because you were unlucky with the map generation (not enough food, amirite?). But then you'll discover new ways to deal with things that you thought were impossible and you'll start getting consistently decent runs.  I feel like there could be more to it than just two game modes with leaderboards, but I can't really think of a way they could do a campaign or something like that. It's not something you're going to spend 10+ hours in, but it's definitely worth it at such a low price.",

            "review_text": " Genre-twisting  runner is really good term to describe  The Tribe . It has unusual game mechanics for this type of game. They are really simple when you look at them on paper; but when you start your run it is not at all rainbows and cupcakes; and it is prime example of game that looks easy, but is really hard to master.  You not only run forward to reach your goal, but you have to take care of your tribesmen in order to survive harsh environment they live in. You need (most then anything) food to feed your tribe. No food = your unstoppable army of prehistoric people starts to die pretty quickly.  Food can be obtained, by setting up the right formation so you can pick berries from bushes, killing a moose or other tribes ... in worst case scenario, you can degrade yourself to cannibalism with hope that you will survive until next level. Harder it is due to obstacles in your way. Rivers, quick sand; flies that will eat your food; bloodthirsty sabertooth, extremely tough rhyno - both can be killed (apparently), but with them in my way I found only death of my people. Easy ... And doing this when night settles in and the darkness cover the whole world ... easy peasy. *stares into the wall, reflecting on many, many, many deaths, and failed runs*   The Tribe  is for me really frustrating, because I am not skillful enough and patient enough to get good in this game, and complete it. I make a lot of mistakes by missclicking, wrongly evaluating situation ahead of me ... and all of this is only my issue. Game itself runs well, controls well, there is nothing wrong with it - something is wrong with me, obviously.  Technically is pretty alright game, nothing stands out really - negatively or positively - that would need special mention.   Overall it is a nice, little, neat game, where you can get easily lost and kill couple hours, if it fits into your wheelhouse. I encourage YOU to give this game a fair chance. It might surprise you.   Grade:   C+ ",
