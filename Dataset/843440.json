    "description": "Pivot XL is the second of three games in my minimalist arcade series that share aesthetics while having different control and game play. It is an addictive 'just-one-more-round' score chaser, perfect for playing while waiting in queue for another game.",

    "minimum_requirements": "OS: Windows 7 (possibly xp as well, no promises) Processor: Dual Core+ Memory: 2 GB RAM Graphics: 512MB+ Storage: 500 MB available space Additional Notes: It's possible Pivot XL uses less resources than that weird old Windows screensaver with the flying winged toasters. Man, I should really read about that, what the heck was that all about?",
    "recommended_requirements": "OS: Windows 10 Processor: I bet if they made a 5 core processor it would be really weird, but could run this game well. Memory: 4 GB RAM Graphics: GeForce GTX 1070 (Pivot XL has one less effect than Bing Bong XL, so you don't need all that 1080 power anymore) Storage: 502 MB available space Sound Card: Will I hit my second wind on writing (clever?!) sound card details? There's only one way to know... --&gt; Turn to page 37 if you want to know.  --&gt; Turn to page 52 if you think this bit went terribly. Additional Notes: The universe is a cruel uncaring void. The key to being happy isn't a search for meaning, it's to just keep yourself busy with unimportant nonsense, and eventually you'll be dead.",
