From the creator(s) of  Zup!  comes  Zup! 2  with even more achievements to rain upon your pretty little head.  The main difference compared to its predecessor is that this time, you'll be doing 2D physics-based puzzles with a ball instead of a cube, which adds a rolling mechanic where you would have expected to stop. Not saying it's better or inferior, but it just feels right. The game even has some free DLC to enjoy for an additional 5 minutes.  Can't really say much bad about this game aside from it simply being short. It's really a nice experience with a bit of replayability should you enjoy this particular kind of title.  Is it worth the asking price of $1? I'd still recommend getting  Zup! 2  for a sale at about 50-80 cents, but seeing as you get card drops you can sell, I can't complain too much.  8/10 It's raining achievements! HALLELUJAH!!",

The main challanges are clicking on the right blocks and timing. Some of the levels feel cheap because of the first reason as the way to solve the level is to click on the right one of the 4 blocks. There was potential to make the levels more challenging because the ball keeps its momentum so it can roll off but only a few levels take actual advantage of that fact. You'll beat the game in 20 minutes so it's probably worth a dollar but I feel like the concept could have gone a lot further.   There are a ♥♥♥♥ ton of achievements for not really a good reason and it seems super gimmicky and stupid really.  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯",
