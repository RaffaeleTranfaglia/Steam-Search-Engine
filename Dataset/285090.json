            "review_text": "Like most other reviews say, it's pretty clear the devs took Plants vs Zombies as a major inspiration for Robowars. So much that it feels more like a buggy reskin of the game instead of its own. The lanes, the resource gathering, multiple types of enemies, even the units are all copied from there, but with hardly the same amount of polish that PopCap used on their title. And to boot, while PopCap is still an active dev, at the time of this writing the dev for Robowars hasn't signed onto Steam in a year. An entire YEAR.  I tried making a profile, made a male one. Wanted to see the female, a text box in Russian pops up. Try entering a name, nothing happens. Game is essentially locked up, had to restart.  Upon entering again, we're given cheap dialogue with grammar errors abound, followed by gameplay that barely explains its quirks and mechanics. There's no details, no stats. No way to tell other than looking at life bars how much damage a turret does. Or how much we heal for.  There's no explanation for how to activate some things, like the tower that supposedly powers up your turrets. Or how long it works. Or if it's even passive. Same with the PvZ Garlic clone; no telling HOW to activate it, so enemy soldiers took it down and kept going.  The windowed / full-screen button is in the level hud right above the Repair / Dismiss / etc functions, not in the actual menus. The pause button is over there, no ESC key here.  There's no reason given for why some units cost money, while others are from the resources you collect. Or if you get them back at the end of the level. Which, if they're destroyed, creates a limited economy that threatens you to conserve them, or just not use them otherwise.  That's a problem in itself, though, since you're barely given enough time to start a defense layout (unlike PvZ where the ramp up was well done) before enemies swarm you. So you HAVE to use your limited use units, from your extremely small (5 cards up to the 9th or 10th stage before I quit) selected hand to take down waves that don't stop.  Eventually you can get up a defense, but at that point the game becomes a Repair spam city as your turrets and units do mystery damage to enemy units whose own details are scant at best. And all of this is wrapped up in a sci-fi military tone too blas√© to care about.  Do yourselves a favor, Comrades. Skip Robowars, go get PvZ if you haven't already, and play a good tower defense game.",

Only it sucks.  Go purchase plants vs zombies instead, you'll have more fun. Or if sci-fi is a must, get Sol survivor. 2 excellent games that do Tower Defense ever so much better.",
