            "review_text": "Cooking Dash is a fun, addictive time management game where you take on the role of Flo, a waitress and owner of Flo's Diner in DinerTown. Flo's chef, Cookie, has been recruited to star in a reality TV cooking series so Flo, with her grandma, must manage the diner without him. Along the way, Cookie has guest chefs on his show so when one of them is absent from their restaurant, Flo and Grandma must substitute for the absent chef.  There are a total of 50 levels and 5 different locations (a.k.a. restaurants) where you can cook various dishes and have to serve a variety of customers. There are upgrades for each restaurant that you can purchase with the money you earn on previous levels. Basically, you control Flo as she serves customers, cooks various dishes, directs Grandma to prepare certain dishes when needed, and collects the customers' payment and clean up afterwards.  Now on to my opinion of this game. As I love time management games, I liked Cooking Dash, despite the lack of Steam achievements or trading cards. I found it to be fun and challenging, especially on the later levels. It requires fast hand reflexes to both pass each level and to get an expert score on it. There are in-game achievements so you can keep track of what you have earned as you progress. The art was good-it has the cartoon style which I found to be appropriate-and the music was fun and kept the pace well.   Overall, I recommend Cooking Dash to anyone who likes time management games and a challenge. Also, I did play the game in story mode although there is an endless mode where you have to serve as many customers as possible until one or more of them are unhappy if they haven't been served fast enough and end up leaving. There is plenty of gameplay and it's a good way to pass the time. ^^",
