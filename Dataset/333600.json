The voice acting is great as it has really an impact to the emotion, The animation is really cutting edge amazing and every time they move just makes me happy. Every character is likeable especially Chocola. Story is great due to it's warm heart comedy atmosphere. The OST's fits every scene as well.  [Recommended seal here] &lt;3  I'm excited for the release of Nekopara Vol.2 on December 2015, Can't wait :3",

            "review_text": "Nekopara is a beautiful love story between a man and his loyal cats showing him the value of family. It's the kind of light hearted love story that sincere, sensitive, gentle men would enjoy. Married men may want to sit this one out, but I would say it could make you more romantic and appreciative towards your spouse; clingy if you take it too far. And for any female gamers who may be interested in Nekopara: bless you for being able to step into a male protagonist's shoes and understanding.  I can not stress this enough: Nekopara is a heavenly fantasty that leaves you begging for more. Part of you will feel extremely satisfied after completion, but another part of you will be left longing for the warm embrace of a lover. IMO, these are very disirable feelings to have, and can only make you a better, sweeter person.  Nekopara Vol.1 is the first part of an upcoming series. And while the play time is only several hours, I think you may appreciate the low asking price. There is an adults-only version of the game available outside of Steam. You can read the discussion forum FAQ section for more information on where to purchase it.",

Seeing these characters come to life outside of art books and short ero comics gives me huge moe feels.  You should buy this if you obsess over catgirls or are looking for another short VN to play.

Totally educational. 10thousand/10  After reading nekopara, I cross play as Nekosojo to work office, and randomly set up a new year party. Totally awesome, would def do it again. 10million/10   Read Nekopara before going to bed, and get @##ed by Nekonoids while sleeping.  It was intensively awesome, would def get poned again. 10trillion/10.  Adult version can be fully combine with steam version and still get achievements R18 version is now my soul food. 10infinite/10  Do I recommended? Totally It helps you reborn to another magical dimention. .................................................... Serious Review:  ok, I am only talking about Steam version at here.  Good:  1. Kawaii Voice acting and character personality  2. Great art work, and it has tons of relative product, like hugging pillow, manga (all age, ichi and hentai) and such. Very good for fans and collectors.  3. Contains many useful vocaburaries in Japanese, thats good for Novice Japanese learner .   4. Bouncy Button is an interesting concept. Love it.  5. Good soundtrack and music  Bad:  1. This Visual Novel has good voice acting, but few scenes voice record quality is a little cachy   2. There isnt multiple ending or story routine you can choose.  3. Translation in Chinese can do better job.  4. To be honest, I dont think the story is very exciting, but the music makes it touching.  The main reason i bought this visual novel is because I use to follow his early work. I am happy to see the artist grow and improve. Hoping to see more of his work.  You dont have to like this visual novel, but its always good to support something you like.",

How come? And yet, it's definitely a common feeling from a lot of us.  Other than that, I am not very sure how to comment it as a visual novel. The length of the story is fairly short { about 8 hours for average gameplay, and I guess we are dying for more }, the story itself is not very...memorable: it's a boy leaves his home for the 1st time trying to make a living by opening a bakery shop himself along with 2 catgirls by his side.   However, with 50% off, I believe it is a no-mistaken strawberry cake that is worth grabbing even just for purely leisure. It is also recommended for the people who's taking a break from big titles like I am. Meow! Meow! Meow!  Scarlet Score: 8.5/10",

Overall loved it and especially loved the interactions with Vanilla &amp; Chocola we also get to learn a bit about them which I found was really interesting and added a bit to there character and why they where so determined to stay with you. Would definitely recommend playing this story also the achievements themselves are easy to unlock there is a hidden achievement which had me laughing at vanilla &amp; Chocola reaction.

The plot is very basic, so it's more about the interactions and conversations the main character has with the cat girls. Every moment is an opportunity for the cat girls to act cute, say cute things, and do cute things.  The graphics are beyond par for this type of game, with incredibly beautiful visuals and details, and impressively animated using Live2D. The vast array of gorgeously frilly lolita inspired clothing will make you constantly fawn over how adorable Chocola and Vanilla look. The character voices are also very good. It's a bit on the trope-y side, but it helps tying it all together in a comfortable familiarity. You'll quickly find your favorite character.  Since this is the first volume, a fair bit of the first few chapters deals with setting the stage, and introducing you to the personalities of all the characters. The 'plot' doesn't really 'pick up' until about half-way through.  One thing I do like about this particular game is the small attention to detail that they've designed. Things like automatically moving the mouse cursor to the center when selecting yes/no for loading/saving. The user interface is intuitive, and the colors are welcoming.  In terms of gameplay, there really is none. It's a non-interactive, visual novel. Don't expect more than that. That's not to say it's a bad thing. It's just to be expected for this kind of game.  If you're thinking about purchasing this game for the sex, you will be disappointed to know that Steam has made the developer completely cut the sexual content. And relatively speaking, that's about 40% of the game! Fortunately, if you google it, you can find an easy to install patch that will restore all the content. So at the very least, buy this game to support the developer!",

This game is sugary adorable on a lethal level; it really only consists of cute catgirls doing cute catgirl things, and the Unvoiced Self-Projection Protagonist™ being around to observe and deal with it. If you don't mind a pointless, cute slice of life story with sexualized humanoid pets, Nekopara won't bite you; it's altogether harmless in its silliness.  There's not much point to the story other than following along with the catgirls' lives and their growing relationship with ye olde faceless hero. All that's required is clicking away at the dialogue or letting it auto for your leisure since there are no choices, and by extension no routes. You're stuck with the two main kitties, so if you're considering this game with any of the others in mind you may as well not get it. Moreover, the game--while hosting some R18 material--still skips sex scenes, so if you're also more on the lookout for something more explicit this might be too vanilla of an alternative.  But like I said, it's pretty harmless; it's honestly just a box of cat-eared firecrackers exploding into Cute and Euphemisms with a serving of incredibly tedious loli siscon here and there (complete with the occasional ego boost from characters who call you 'Master' and love you unconditionally).  In the end found it fun enough for a short story, but what really kept me around were the smooth movements of the character portraits. Perhaps I was just so mesmerized by the art style, facial expressions and stunning transitions that I just didn't care about anything else. The CGs were nice too, but mate... The portraits MOVE. I know, because you can tell by the unnatural boob jiggles as they just stand around and breathe.  It's with a heavy heart that I declare myself impressed over something like that but you must know that I am two things: weak, and a cat person.  So I suppose what y'all can take from this is, if an asexual like myself can enjoy this game well enough, you probably can too. And hell, if it happens to be up your fap alley, go ahead and proceed, you crazy furries.",

Excellence abounds at every turn in this open-world role-playing game: excellent exploration, excellent creature design, excellent combat mechanics, excellent character progression. But the moments that linger are those that reveal the deep ache in the world's inhabitants. In one quest, you reunite two lovers, one of which is now a rotting hag, its tongue lasciviously lolling from its mouth. In another, a corpulent spouse-abuser must find a way to love two different lost souls, each of which test the limits of his affection. Don't worry that these vague descriptions spoil important events: they are simple examples of the obstacles every resident faces. On the isles of Neko Paradise and back home with Shigure, there is no joy without parallel sorrow. Every triumph demands a sacrifice. Overall nice cheap porn - 9/11",

The elephant in the room never left for me, but there's a pretty decent level of distraction. That said, it's downright surreal when people in your bakery inquire with anything other than disgust regarding your sexual experiences with what are considered your pets in this game's setting.  The plot is virtually nonexistent. You take these cat-human hybrids as slave labor because your sister is a horrible person and they want to get away from her. They claim to love you in order to do this. However it was all a diabolical plot by your sister to get you laid (or, if it were real life, forever label you with the social stigmata of being a cat-♥♥♥♥er). She actually did this because she couldn't find a way to get in your pants herself. I'm not joking. Literally every character in this game wants to ♥♥♥♥ you.  Back to the topic of cat-♥♥♥♥ing, the H-scenes patch (see community hub) is rather unique because of how the sprites in this game move. If you're into erotica I'd recommend it. I just downloaded it for the full experience and skimmed through most of it, though, because I'm not interested in most pornography. I'm not sure you'd want to play the game without it though. It's kind of difficult to describe my feelings on the subject.  All-in-all, you should definitely play this game if you feel you have no qualms forcing man-made demi-humans into slave labor. Me, I played a lot of RPGs that already touched on that subject (well, aside from the man-made part) when I was younger, so I didn't enjoy that part too much. But a 'romantic' (hot, sexy, erotic) read is worth it.  Also, like most games, this game has trading cards which lets you refund some of the purchase price effectively. If it's on sale, you can probably get it for a net cost of like $3-$4. Which is good enough.",

So, *YES i did purchase this myself, don't judge until you see my profile info* where do i start on this game. For one it has a long playability but no paths like other games i.e If My Heart Had Wings, Everlasting Summer, etc. So one run through is all you're going to get, it may not seem worth it but look at my hours.. That's with me speedreading, i didn't taking my time reading and going in depth. This is a very emotional anime/Vn i've seen since Everlasting Summer and a few others.   For one *spoiler* the protagonist gets sick and nearly loses both the girls because they try to help him... Their faces...... The emotion... The feels!! ;_; And yes i did shead a tear at that part, call me a big baby, go ahead i dare you. I will send you the hentai patch... oh wait you would probably like that *all evil jokes aside*   The hentai patch, like all other VN's, ruins the game for me. But the good thing about it is if you want to see very little hentai *like half of 2 chapters out of 11* then it's not that bad. Most of your playthrough will have you laughing though as well.. Cat girls... or in this case as 'I' will call them... nekos! I'm not spoiling much but i will say something, if you don't want a possible harem anime... *sorry if i spelt that wrong* do NOT go after this game, for one the two nekos, at the end it turns into 5, plus your sister making advances at you in the story making it lean to incest, well not actual 'advances' more like he leaves the room and she talks to herself saying how she would love to be with him.. All weirdness aside, if you can ge past all of the stuff i said. Pick up this game, it has a bunch of different kind of emotions, a lot of funny, a few sad, most normal or just plain stupid.. yes i'm looking at you with your training scene with vanilla, devs!!!

Story isn't much, it feels like a teaser with fanservice to me, but I think it's enjoyable, whether some may think it's some sort of BS or not.  Only downside for me is that this is short, which is understandable by the title Vol.1; it's long enough to enjoy it.  I like to shake the game window (since I play in windowed mode) as if I want to minimize everything except for this game. Otherwise, you can just press P for similar effect, but you can't really control directions with that. Shaking the window is best.    ....don't forget to maximize the bounciness meter *cough*.   looking forward to further interactions, maybe with other cat girls;;;",

I would say the next game, but seeing as how it comes out tomorrow whenever I write this, I don't have to wait long, but that ending! Absolutely amazing!

Vol. 1 is an apt part of the title because it definitely doesn't feel complete. I think after finishing the storyline you're definitely going to be crying out, 'BUT WHERE'S THE REST OF IT?', but that alone should tell you it's a pretty good game. I'm disappointed that the story didn't develop as much as I hoped it would, but I can't argue that I was delighted the whole time I was playing due to the colorful characters and the question of where everything was leading (although unsatisfactorily answered). As part of a series this is a great start, but woefully inadequate (especially compared to fantastic FREE novels like Katawa Shoujo) as a standalone VN.   But catgirls are ♥♥♥♥ing cute so 10/10.",

(no pun intended) I guess due to this being Sayori's work however some hentai had to be somewhere.   Basically if you purchase this game to only reap the H-scenes... I'd suggest going to Google. You wont miss much at all. However if you want a light-hearted story with excellent artwork, music and satisfactory characters... you wont go far wrong with purchasing Nekopara.",

It be good if you could pick destinations, actions, or pick things/items, just anything really. Otherwise you spend the whole game clicking and thats all. The art style is amazing and beautiful, the tones and texture are clear and smooth for the most part, the only problem is when there is movement it gets alittle fuzzy. I love anime and some visual novel games but it be good if you had choices or something. 6/10 Rating from me",
