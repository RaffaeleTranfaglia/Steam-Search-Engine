            "review_text": "Kind of fun at first, but gets old fast. Your level and weapon progress stays after your death, which is a nice touch. The problem is the game design. First off, every level in each world is the same and you fight the same 3 enemies of that world every level, which is super boring. Then you fight a boss which is just a bigger version of one of those enemies. The retry and store system is legit terrible. Buying the first shortcut cost 10k, and to get to it you need another 5k to buy triple jump. This means you can't use them, and if you die you have to repeat the same boring levels again and again. After buying the first gate I never spent another time and played through 4 worlds and still didn't even have enough to buy the gate for the world before the world I was on. This terrible design forces repetition due to lazy game design. Also buying gates means you cant buy other upgrades, not that you could anyways, as some cost 50k to 150k. I don't understand how they could be so stupid to put all the prices so high. Most of the guns are boring anyways, and some, like the boomerangm are just strictly better than all the other ones.   3/10.",

            "review_text": "  OK! After I have unlocked every weapon, ability, level , boss, all weapons are level 10, ive been level 20 for ages now.... I can say this game is great,few reasons why...  * Progression through abiities and weapons + upgrades * Traditional dungeon crawl , lots of loot to find, enemies to defeat  * The shortcuts to levels you have beaten bosses of, are very needed. * The combonation of swordplay + guns  * Variety in enemies means different strategies for each one  * shotgun is great! until you get boomerang :3 * It;s a cute game, has to be said.  Here's a few downsides.  * The levels are LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONG.  Very very long. Mind-numbingly long.  My suggestion on this is buy those level shortcuts asap so you arent trudging through all 110 levels every time you die.  * Some weapons don't work on some bosses, mainly the bomb gun, and boomerang. I can see why certain weps dnot work on bosses, but.... the chain saw gun works on EVERY boss, and can decimate every boss, in literally no time at all if you fire fast enough....which leads me to my next downer abotu this game, and its a huge one.  There's no limit to the firing rate of any gun. Sounds great, right&gt;? Not really, as all you need to do is shortcut macro a key to fire ridiculous amounts of bullets, and crush through everything, I did all 6 zones (and bonus area) in about 35 minutes dong this, lol. You can;t be touched.  Devs need to cap firing rate on weps, as there's no way to prevent ppl from using turbofire.  That's all i can think of, and i wanna go after that bonus section again (another downer, there;s no shortcut to AFTER the 'final' boss, meaning if you want to challange the bonus area, you gottaq go through ALL of zone 6 ... again... kind of a bummer.  All in all, this game is fantastic, and literally consumed all of my time. I highly recommend it, as far as dungeon crawlrs go, this one is at the top .",

It doesn't feel as tight as CC3 but that is nothing that the developer can quick patch, but don't get it wrong as not good and unplayable, its good but it can be better. And i will warn you the game is more difficult so be warned and have fun. might leave an update on when i finish the game",
