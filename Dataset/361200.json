Graphic quality settings have little to no-effect on frame rates.   The fact that the developer or publisher doesn't even bother to mention Radeon in the System Requirements is indicative of their disdain and should be taken as a clear warning if you have Radeon GPU. Luckily i got this in a bundle so it's no big loss.  This game is very low on my to-play list. 2/10",

Upon closing the game(forcing it to close because it froze)I had a headache. The 'story', the last possible saving grace for it, was also pathetic and confusing.",
