            "review_text": "So, the short part: yes the game is incredible, and yes you should play it. To those wondering about complaining about the price or the length: movies cost a hell of a lot more and have a lot less impact. If you're wondering about the folks outright critizing the game without even playing it or saying it should have never been on Steam to begin with, and somehow dragging the quality of Steam down: remind yourself that the internet is filled with the absolute worst people that ever roamed the fact of the earth.  The long part... Talking about gameplay or graphics seems like a hollow exercise for a game like this. For the uninitiated, the game consists of point and click vignettes chroicling the Green family's struggle through their son Joel's battle with cancer. I was surprised at the tone, as I really expected a big sadfest from start to finish. The game takes surprising turns, though, with very happy memories, along with the sad ones. The game explores a number of themes, including crises of faith, grief &amp; loss, strength in adversity, and the struggle for normalcy.   To address the elephant in the living room, the topic of faith (especially that of Christian faith) is very present throughout the game, but really only in the context of how the Greens feel, and not once did the game feel preachy. It's a delicate balance that's well maintained. The game feels extremely genuine, with very personal topics the Greens went through laid bare, including marital strife as a result of Joel's cancer. Throughout the game, you'll vire the events through different perspectives, including Joel's.   The art direction is superb, with different pieces of the narrative popping in once you look away from an item on screen and look back. The sound design is equally well done; the music through the game is varied and always appropriate.   This game was one of the most difficult games I've ever played, As a parent, I constantly projected my own kids into my perception of events, and it made it all the more difficult. The tone of the game, however, isn't one of blatant misery, but really a very pensive reflection of how this particular family dealt with tragedy, and as such, can be appreciated by those without kids. The game leaves plenty of room for reflection and interpretation, and I'm sure there will be hundreds of different opinions on what different points in the narrative mean.   The Greens (and the rest of the dev team) have created a thoughtful narrative that must have been very difficult to make, and those of us who play it, quite frankly, are going to be better for it. The game is short, but the impact of the narrative is felt deeply. Do yourself a favor - play this game, do so without preconceptions, and allow yourself to appreciate the experience.",

            "review_text": "Cancer. Tragedy.  Two words that have ended as synonymous far more often than anyone cares to remember. Cancer and other terminal illnesses are something that almost all of us have been touched by in some way. Whether it be from a person very close to us, ourselves, or just someone that has influenced us in some way. If it hasn't, odds are it will at some point in your life. These diseases invariably impact us in a negative and tragic way. We have experienced loss due to them and watched others suffer unimaginable pain trying to survive and fight to stay alive.   At the same time there is defintiely something else that comes from experiences of dealing with ternminal illness. While contemplating the losses that are sure to come, one can't help but think of all the ways we discover the true value of beauty, life, and love as it is slipping away. Our senses to these feelings become more acute. We realize what matters to us. What we would really miss if we weren't here. We contemplate wasted time and struggle to determine what is actually valuable and worthwhile while we have such a short time to experience life.   As we look back on those we lost, we understand that these people are part of human history. Everyone has their own story. We wonder if we may have an impact that can be somewhat immortal after we are gone by making sure we do something that will be remembered. Is this what matters for a life? Is it impacting others in a way that makes them remember us, or is that not really what is important? Is it important to just give as much as we can while we are here to help others, regardless of how long we are remembered, or do we have a duty to leave something behind that lasts well beyond or time on Earth? What is most important?  Those that deal with terminal illnesses where they have a sense of not just how they will die, but roughly when they will die are more likely to contemplate these things I reckon. I know watching someone I care about dying from such an illness makes me think about these things, and how much time I waste on things I deem to be pointless. A story like this makes me think about all these same things.   'That Dragon, Cancer' is a true story about a very small boy that gets cancer when he is only a couple years old. We listen to the voices of his parents, siblings, and of the boy as he fights cancer. We hear the inner dialogues that his parents have with themselves. How distraught they feel, how scared they are, how helpless they feel about it. We also see how they use faith in 'God' to help them through it. One parent has almost no doubts about their faith, while the other questions it in many ways.   As a player we can feel an enormous amount of sorrow while playing through it. We know that everyone involved is dealing with cancer on a daily basis and their lives are in a struggle fighting 'That dragon, cancer' as it is described. The game is broken into several sections in which we see random blocky sort of graphics in an abstract style. There isn't much in the form of mechanics other than clicking on objects to move the world around and get more commentary. IT is a 'walking simulator'. Many of the scenes we hear are live voice acting that I have to assume are either re-enacted, or were saved through video, or recordings when they happened originally. We hear the parents talking to the kids and sharing normal daily moments like singing lullabyes before bedtime, their sons laughing and joking, and many many instances of their son Joel, who has the illness, laughing. (I am guessing this is really him, but I have no idea). It really gives us the feeling of what they are going through and we feel like we are getting to know them as real people.   We aren't just getting voices form the family, however. As we walk through hospital halls we are able to see some real life artworks from cancer patients and dozens of personal notes, which I assume are those that have come together for the project, or met the developer and family through their own battles with cancer. These are displayed as greeting cards all over tables and hanging on walls throughout hospital rooms during certain sections. Must be at least 100 of these and I read every single one of them, which is why my playtime is higher than most. Some were survivors, some are just positive messages to go on, and some are memorials to those that have lost the fight. Many of which are small children that makes your heart ache that much more. Also, we have personal letters that are read with voice acting in other scenes about the experiences some have had as well.   While the major theme of this is dealing with cancer there is another significant theme throughout this game as well that deals with the parents' belief and faith in 'God' (Christian God since they mention Jesus a few times). As a non-believer this is familiar as we live in a society that is mostly believers so it isn't anything new. What I found interesting here was that it was a great look into the mind of a believer in my eyes. It gives some insight into how they think, as well as a lot of examples of why they do believe, or can convince themselves to. While it may, or may not be intentional to give a counter-point, one of the two characters even has significant doubts and asks many logical questions that many non-believers once asked before they became non-believers. Yet, he does not. This gave me some thoughts of how much one can love a mate, or they have such fears of being alone and losing a mate, that they may simply lie to them, or themselves about belief like this to placate a wife/husband, or to stay together due to a possible breaking of the family. I am sure many believers hide their non-belief due to the possible consequences of being found out. I won't stay on this topic any longer, but belief in a higher power definitely has a significant role in this game. I think most can expect that from a story that portrays a tremendous loss such as a child trying to find answers. This is THEIR story, and they are believers so of course it covers these themes. They aren't writing about me after all.   Overall, the game absolutely should make you cry. If you are in the right mindset and feel like playing such a game then by all means do I recommend it. I don't think rating this game makes sense, or trying to say buy it on sale, or not. If you can relate to, or want to you will play it eventually. I suggest that you try to immerse yourself into it philosophically as well as emotionally to get as much as you can out of it too. Read all the cards you see, view all the artwork, etc. These all gave me a lot of thoughts about just how important a single person can be to others, and how significant their lives are to the meaning of someone else's. Just how many histories there are out there that deal with this type of loss. It made me want to hug someone I cared about today and let them know that I love them, and that I am glad I have the chance to know them.   Take care. :)  I nominated this for: 'The “I'm Not Crying, There's Something In My Eye” Award' in the 2016 Steam Awards :D",

It is a great atmospheric experience that really envelops the played.  With that being said, it's not my type of video game. If you like the atmospheric story-based minimal games, I'd recommend playing this. It's very sad and there isn't much going on, it's almost movie-like. There are no choices, and you're just goign through the progression of a story line (very simply).",

            "review_text": "Man, ♥♥♥♥ cancer. --------------------------------- 2/28/16 Serious review:  This is a heavy game. There's no other way to put it. The degree this game affects you can vary depending your feelings on very personal subjects (religion, in particular) but, at the end of the day, this is a heavy, very human, very interesting game.  Essentially, this is a mechanically simple point-and-click game. While the player may be distracted by the myriad vistas it has to offer, the path the player must go through to progress is plainly laid out. The style of graphics (a kind of Out of This World-style polygonal format) follows suit with the simplicity of the controls, and does more to attract the player to the story, rather than take away from it. What really matters in That Dragon, Cancer, though, is the writing.  Ryan Green's prose is purely sincere, and this sincerity shines through in its range of complexity. At times, he will quote and create passages that would fit well in any poem but, in darker moments, he will discard all pretension and lay out his bare feelings. In either instance, it is always easy to understand his level of distress, anger, fear, despair, and hope each time he speaks. If I had to pick an excellent sample of his writing, I'd choose the following statement he makes near the beginning, presumably speaking of cancer itself:  'Fear is cancer's preservative. Cancer's embalming oil. And you, oh Accuser, are fear's oil salesman. You're a snake. A serpent. A dragon with snuffed out coal on his breath. Molting, talons broken from the struggle to free yourself of your own skin.'  While it's an excellent bit of writing in itself, the accompanying reading by Ryan hammers home the bitter, personal hatred he has for the disease. It's the combination of writing and voice acting that really kept me hooked, and hearing Ryan emote was just as meaningful, if not more so, than any image provided.  If there was to be any criticism in my experience with this game, it would be that it's...disjointed. It feels like the game was made when this tragedy was ongoing, which makes it a bit difficult to follow as far as what point in this all the chapters take place. On the other hand, this does give a more raw feel to the whole game, making it seem more like these chapters were made in the moment, rather than a recollection. Still, this can be a bit troubling when trying to follow a timeline.  In summary: this game was not entertaining. It was not fun. However, I can say with full confidence that this was engaging. I paid full price for this and honestly don't regret a second, as I got an experience that was more emotionally draining and impactful than any game that I have played in recent memory, and quite possibly ever.",

Not only did I feel the sorrow and sadness that the Green family felt, but I also shared in the joy of Joel's laughter and beautiful ending.  As the player, you switch from third person to first person as different people. For me, this gave me the opportunity to understand how the different characters were handeling Joel's situation. The graphics are stunning but different from other games as they show no facial details on the characters, making you imagine what the characters are going through. I did not know going into the game, but the voice actors were the actual family, and the adorable laughing is Joel's himself; looking at this, I would not want the voice acting any other way as it adds more sentiment to the story. Many people are cautious about playing games with sadder topics like about cancer or death, but I think that everyone should give this game a try as it will affect anyone who plays it. Overall, finding the correct words to describe this game as a whole is difficult as it makes you question uncertain topics on death or if there is an afterlife as well as questioning what would you do if you were in this situation. These philosophical questions only make the game better, and it is by far one of the best games I played. I would highly recommend playing this game with a box of tissues at your side because you will need them.",

It's more like an interactive movie than a traditional video game, which makes sense for this story. I liked the way the game incorporated a mix of video game formats (like a racing game and platformer), though the majority is point and click.  I expected this game would make me feel as if I personally had a child with cancer, although perhaps that was a ridiculously high bar to set. In the end, I felt like I better understood the experience of one family's battle with childhood cancer. I sympathized but couldn't really empathize. This was particularly true because the parents in the game are strong Christians, and I am not very religious. This game is one family's story, not any family's story - which I say mainly to help set others' expectations.  I enjoyed the game overall and felt a range of emotions reinforced by the music and art.

I will say this though, for a game it really does not take much to be amazing and moving. A game doesn't need crazy graphics in my opinion. It just takes a good story and something that the player can relate to.  To wrap this up I just want to say that it isn't only relatable if you've had someone die or go through cancer because I've never had anyone die or go through cancer and this game still moved me. Because being put in the shoes of someone who was, was heartbreaking, life changing, I don't really know other words to descibe it because I really want to do the game justice.

While the experience of playing through this one is brief, its value is not so short-lived. This game makes you think in new ways. It is bold in its willingness to confront you with discomfort. It invites you to experience pain and grief along with its characters. And then it shows you joy.  This game is different from other games. It's enjoyable in a way that I didn't know a game could be. It is intensely personal. Powerful in it's ability to evoke emotion.  I heard about this game on Radiolab in the episode 'The Cathedral.' I think knowing the backstory of its creation made things more enjoyable for me. It allowed me to align my perspective with that of the characters from the beginning. Some may instead prefer to begin playing knowing as little as possible beforehand.",

            "review_text": "My mother was diagnosed with cancer in end of 2013. It was a tumultuous time, filled with some glimmer of hope, many restless nights, and the occasional crying when nobody was looking. It was a lonely time, despite having the support of family and friends near and far. It was a time when everybody was putting on a brave face, especially my mother, who did not want her family to see her being sad or in pain. She is like that -- she would rather keep her pain to herself than make other people sad or worry about her.  To this day, the memory of my mother having cancer, despite her being in remission at the time of this review, fills me with sadness and fear. (I wanted to weep as I typed this.) Cancer, or any (possibly) terminal diseases, casts a dark shadow over the victims and their circles of family and friends. Given my experience, I was drawn to 'That Dragon, Cancer' because I want to see how a family uses this medium to grief and to express their sorrow.  I recommend 'That Dragon, Cancer' because it is an artistic work that depicts the impact of cancer on a family. I support it because it is a way for the family to deal with their loss and share their story. If it happens to help them recover part of the cost of the treatment for their child in the meantime, all the better.  Despite my recommendation, I would like to point out that I was disappointed by how 'That Dragon, Cancer' turned out. What follows may contain or be considered spoilers for some people, so be warned.  'That Dragon, Cancer' was advertised as an 'immersive, narrative videogame that retells Joel Green’s 4-year fight against cancer through about two hours of poetic, imaginative gameplay that explores themes of faith, hope and love.' Yet, it is not so much a 'videogame', but more of an interactive narrative. Furthermore, the focus of 'That Dragon, Cancer' is not Joel's fight against cancer, but his parents' reaction to his diagnosis, pain, treatment, and death, as well as their feeling of helplessness.  The version of 'That Dragon, Cancer' that I 'played' was version 1.0.1. It was very buggy although the initial set of fixes had been applied. It crashed multiple times, thus disrupting the story and my immersion into it. I read online that the developers suggested running 'That Dragon, Cancer' windowed instead of full screen to deal with the crashes. Not only did their recommendation not work, but running the program windowed only further lessened the immersion.  'That Dragon, Cancer' also took a 'poetic' (avant garde and abstract I guess?) approach to storytelling. I appreciated the earnest attempt to use metaphors and symbols to highlight the nastiness of cancer and the sense of helplessness, but it made the interaction and narrative disjointed. The inclusion of other people's notes and tributes to their own families and friends, while a nice gesture, only distracted from the main story. At the same time, I did not feel the 'dragon' metaphor was fully explored, though comparing dealing with cancer to being in a dark forest was a nice touch.  'That Dragon, Cancer' worked best when the sound effects and Jon Hillman's soundtrack were at the forefront. The dialogue were melodramatic at times and awkwardly delivered, but I did enjoy the voice acting for the father. I thought the scenes with the father reacting to Joel's crying were particularly poignant. Ironically, it was the showing of pictures of Joel during his various stages of cancer, and not the extravagant symbolism, that made me feel the family's pain and sorrow most because that was when it felt most real.  So, as a piece of art, I did not enjoy 'That Dragon, Cancer' that much. However, art is subjective, and you may feel differently about this production. I do think 'That Dragon, Cancer' is a great way for Joel's family to grief and to express sorrow, and we should take some time to listen to their story regardless of what other people think about this production.",

            "review_text": "I don't recommend people buy this game, but I'm still glad it was made. Interactive experiences like this are a new art form that deserve support, but not all experiments bear fruit.  Here's what I liked in no particular order:  1) Nice music, although it got a bit repetitive at times.  2) When viewed from a distance, the abstract human figures looked quite nice.   3) Some of the fanatasy imagry was beautiful. I particualrly liked to see balloons carry Joel ride on constellations come to life.  4) The cancer ward filled with cards was simple but devastatingly effective. It conveyed how many people had fought to live in those halls.  5) A lot of Ryan's narration was quite moving. I wish we had been 'in his head' the whole game. I thought the episode where he's trying to get Joel to settle down was well done. It wasn't a bug that Joel was invisible -right? I was able to empathize with Joel much more in that scene than I could at most other times...  Here is what I disliked:  1) The abstact character models were a big, big, turn-off for me when viewed close-up. Whenever I was forced to get physically close to Joel, I was repulsed. I was acutely aware that this thing in front of me was just a collection of polygons, and it just felt 'wrong' to pretend I was playing with a real toddler. The fact that this was all based on a little kid that had really died made things even worse. I would be as if someone made a doll that looked like Joel and expected me to pretend that lifeless, inert doll was a a living, breathing child.  2) The controls were frustrating. I get that the creators wanted to limit interactivity to help maintain the tone they wanted and to focus the narrative. However, there are better ways to do that which don't have me constantly wondering where I'm allowed to click or what I have to click before I can procede. This might have been less of an issue if there weren't parts of the game that I disliked and wanted to get through ASAP. Still, any time that I'm thinking of how to get through the game as a GAME means I'm stepping back from being immersed in the experience you're trying to create.  3) On that note, the driving and platforming mini-games were clumsy and un-fun. I enjoyed break from the monotony of click-hunting, but you have a problem when you need mini-games to distract from the tedium of your core gameplay.  4) The one place the clicking around really grated on me was when you're fluttering around the ocean filled with bottles. I didn't know where I had to go and got frustrated.  5) This might seem cruel, but I didn't like Amy's voicework or what she had to say. Because of that, it was a real chore to have to listen to all of those bottles filled with her letters. Her stuff seemed very one-note to me while Ryan had more of an arc. It also seemed like we didn't see her worry, suffer, and grieve as intimately as we saw Ryan do all of those things. I recogize that she doesn't have to do so the same way or as visibly as he does, but it seemed like everything we saw of her was through the lens of her religion while Ryan was more human and nuanced.  This whole review probably comes off as cruel, but I feel like a public work of art deserves public critcism. If Ryan or Amy ever read this, wish you all the best and commend you for your courage in making this game.",

The reason i am not recommending this game is due to the fact that in scene 3, 'On Hospital Time', it wont let me move or look around or do anything for that matter. I'm just stuck looking at the chair in the middle of the room. There seems to be no fix for it, as I've tried restarting the game and also tried replaying through the first two scenes again. It just gets stuck and i have to exit the game. Until that gets fixed, this was a waste of 15 dollars, since it does not work on my screen. I installed it on my roommates computer and it worked fine on his 16:9 display, but i don't have access to his computer constantly.  This is a warning to those that have 21:9 displays, stay away until they fix this issue. I will update this review accordingly.     ****I MANAGED TO FINISH THE GAME, I BORROWED MY ROOMMATES MONITOR FOR THE NIGHT*****  The following is my review of the actual game itself;  I went into this game expecting to cry a lot. My family is no stranger to cancer. My grandmother was diagnosed with Breast Cancer when I was around 15 years old. She beat it, or so we thought. It reappeared in her lymph nodes when i was 19. By the time I had turned 21, it was back full force. I was away for most of the year after I joined the military, and when I finally came back home, she was no longer the strong woman I once looked up to. She was one of the closest people in my life and the struggle of watching her deteriorate absolutely broke me. There is still a feeling of guilt and remorse to this day for personal reasons I don't wish to divulge. But now my Aunt is also struggling with terminal cancer, she's already living past when the doctors expected. My mother just underwent surgery on her lip for a cancerous group of cells. My grandfather had skin cancer on his nose. My other grandfather battled with prostate cancer. This game was going to hit very hard in a very tender spot for me.  All that being said, I was crying by the second scene. By the time I hit the scene with all of the cards (you'll see) I was an absolute mess. Tears, snot, shaking uncontrollably, all of it. I had to walk away from the computer for an entire hour to compose myself. It hit too close to home. I couldn't read any more of those god damned cards. By the time I had finished the game, I almost felt a shred of relief. But the credits even got me going again.  This game also deals with a struggle of faith in christianity, none of which I can personally relate to as I am agnostic. But it might reach out to some of you folks more than it did for me.  As for the actual game itself, the controls felt a little clunky, and even upping the look sensitivity felt a little too slow still.  There were quite a few completely unneeded mini-games strewn throughout as well, often not giving you any sort of instructions. I feel that these interrupted the flow of the story being told, and were too distracting. This would function better as an interactive experience instead of feeling like it was forced to have more game like qualities.   In short, I got more than I bargained for in the emotional department. The game tries too hard to be a game sometimes instead of focusing on the storytelling experience. Overall, if you enjoy extremely emotional (and true) stories, it's worth playing through. Just be prepared for the occasional mini-game that feels out of place.",

            "review_text": "That Dragon, Cancer Review  I knew from my first moment laying eyes on the trailer for this game that I would have to approach this game differently. I knew I would need to approach slowly and methodically, understanding what this game really was. That Dragon Cancer is a memoir to the passing of a real life child named Joel Green who was afflicted with cancer. He died at 5 years old, too young and too short a life by any imaginable standard. His parents Ryan and Amy Green created this game as a tribute, a diary, and a message of who Joel was and as a reflection of what he had to endure at such a young age. While I knew what to expect from the game from the moment of its inception, I never truly knew how affecting it would be until the credits rolled. I truly have not played or experienced a work of art quite like this because it his almost wholly unique. This game lies on a plane beyond gruff action protagonists, high score chasing and the pursuit of dominance or “bad-assery” that the majority of the game industry covets and chases at all costs. It is personal at the highest level, a bittersweet invitation into the hardship and inevitability of a real life struggle that the Green family and numerous others around the world have and continue to face every single day. It’s an in-depth look at the role of faith and God in the lives of everyday people, and how it brings reflection and comfort in the most difficult of times. And while this remains a review of the game you’ll be receiving, it’s also a hesitant, judgment-free and meticulously gentle word to compliment the immense payoff you’ll receive from playing the game.  Presentation: The game has a simplistic and geometric visual style grounded in abstract expression. Many of the textures and details are purposely omitted in favor of primary colors to express concepts and ideas. The visuals evoke many of the games deeply human concepts effortlessly, whether it be mentally in the minds of Ryan, Amy or Joel, or through the depiction of a story accompanied through dialogue and more. Even the digital forms on screen are simple in design but effective enough to know exactly what you are looking at. The music is non-intrusive, harmonious and decisively melancholic, allowing you to get lost in the flowing of emotion on-screen and within ourselves. Even the dialogue spoken by characters is distinctly soft, but poignant due to the subject matter. It’s clear the aesthetics were designed solely so you could get lost in the spirally roller coaster of Joel’s battle with cancer, from his initial diagnosis and all events proceeding it. The games presentation is so hard hitting and vividly affecting because it is all real. These are digital recreations of real events and the thoughts within the Green family’s minds. This is not a video game with a fictional premise or epic narrative. It’s a family surviving the most difficult moment life can bear: the inevitable and helpless loss of a child. Every narrative moment and dialogue delivery held my attention with utmost respect and complicity because I knew these events actually happened. Every moment felt like I had payed to get a personal glimpse into the most haunting and excruciating moment in the Green family’s life, which gave me pause every time the thought crossed my mind.  Gameplay: The gameplay, outside of a few sections, continues the trend of non-intrusive interaction. Relying almost entirely of pointing on objects and directions to proceed for the next piece of narrative. The game will often let you interact with its world and writings, but almost always in limited fashion to advance the story. It is purposely minimal in scope and practice, which suits it because it’s difficult to imagine a single genre that could adequately encapsulate and push forward this tale by mere gameplay alone. The game has some diversity in various sections that work beautifully as game-driven storytelling. It has a driving section in the Green’s home where you briefly take a third person driving view within Joel’s wonderful imagination. There is a simple side-scrolling section with a few enemies and the head of a dragon which match a somber story being told to Joel with cancer as this powerful dragon that many of tried to conquer, to no avail. These are mostly solid, but there are times where it feels like the game was grasping at straws trying to find something interactive to do to fill its gameplay sections, even though I would have been fine simply existing in this space as a bystander and not sticking to normal game conventions in this case. Everything fits well in the context of Joel’s imagination though and these sequences often gave us a breath of air in a deeply reflective and contemplative experience, showing how at the darkest of times humans must sometimes retreat and engage our imaginations to escape a terrifying reality. That Dragon Cancer nails this feeling at almost every turn.  Overall Value: Once again, I’m floored at how I feel I must construct this section of the review differently. Value is a very strange metric to measure, since its objective nature leaves it on a person-by-person basis. The game retails for $15 for about 2 hours of game, which is a price/length ratio that has been criticized heavily in the past. However, I believe the subject matter, personal nature of the family’s struggle and general unique atmosphere and drama of the title lends it weight that few other games have ever matched. The price feels like a mere inconvenience in all honesty, a simple step you engage in to gain access to the work and I paid without a second thought merely due to my desire to view their experience close up. You could easily do research on the Internet to find out Joel’s ultimate fate or watch a Let’s Play and save the money, however there is something about supporting the family and viewing it in my own way that was extremely important to me. Objectively though, the game admittedly offers minimal gameplay and interaction, with only a few sections to speak of on that front, with the rest offering a viewing experience or clicking on papers to read with voiceovers. Gamers who focus heavily on gameplay will likely not be satisfied with what’s on offer, however lovers of narrative driven experiences with gameplay as a simple tool to experience the world will love this title. This title will be poignant in the highest regard to players whose friends or own families have been affected by the wide reaching effects of cancer in real life and to those people, it will likely be a quicker decision.  Verdict: That Dragon Cancer is a very special and personal game. No other video game I’ve ever played has ever given such a blunt and harrowing view into the lives of real people. Often times it feels like the player is opening the diary of the family and peering into the darkest recesses of their hopes and fears, all as they fight and eventually accept the ultimate fate of their child. While terribly sad, it also shows the incredible power of hope and how faith can give us strength in impossible circumstances. Engaging with that sense of inevitability and powerlessness is ultimately this game’s most superb yet surreal achievement. The visuals are simple but effective enough to serve the purpose the game is trying to fulfill. Gameplay purists may leave the title with buyer’s remorse, but that may likely be overridden with the other gifts the game can provide. This game will truly offer very different things to different audiences, something powerful that cannot be fully valued. For me, I also leave the experience with a sense of pride in the game industry I haven’t felt in years, learning the lengths that games continue to strive towards to provide artistic experiences. If art is meant to touch the soul of a person and make them reflect on their life, That Dragon Cancer may be one of the finest examples of art our medium has.",

Thank you for the hero you let me find and he will always be in my heart. We love you Joel, more than you can know.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game to support this wonderful project after I watched the whole game.  This is more an interactive movie about losing a child that had cancer. The developer created the game to raise attention for cancer and most importantly, to better understand how hard it was to lose your own child after it has been diagnosed. All the dialogues in the game are taken from their life and the struggle with their enemy - the cancer. It is beautiful to just listen to the story that is underlined by a similarly beautiful soundtrack. It is a short, but very emotional game that totally shows for me WHY games can be so important. Not only for fun, but to make people better understand and show how crucial experiences can change your perception and how they can transform your whole life.",

            "review_text": "Alright, I heard about this game while it was still being developed and Joel was still fighting his battle against cancer. This game has a couple frustrating things mentioned in some other reviews, but overall the story telling is worth the price in my mind. Here are some pros and cons [Spoilers].  Pros: -The atmoshpere and lighting throughout most of the game really enhances the story telling -Most of the voice acting throughout the game is good quality, and holds with the above -This game made me actually feel genuine sorrow for Joel and his family, not many games do that anymore  -The art in many levels is amazing for the polygonal style that was chosen (more in cons) -Towards the end when they give the bad news about Joels cancer, it talks about how the doctors and people who helped feel genuine sadness about not being able to help Joel, and gives you insight into what they thought -Pancake parties... need I say more?  Cons: -The art in other sections of the game did feel like there could be more detail, but it did not impede the gameplay -The game sometimes made me do an option or two twice and played the same dialog before furthering the story, maybe just a bug, but was slightly imersion breaking -Towards the ending it gets REALLY religious on the parents part, which in a smaller dose would have been fine, since many people turn to religion in grief, but by the end I found myself wishing to just get through the references already  Honestly, through out the story, it holds true to what the story is about, a family trying their hardest to help their young son fight his battle with cancer. You will probably get the feels.",

I cried when watching all this. The devs have done an amazing job with the design, it didn't need to be graphical, the music was perfect I do reccomend getting this.  Together one day we will beat cancer.",

For anyone reading this and considering buying this game I can't give this game the respect it warrants in words. I cried-bawled- my way through this beautiful story, and my tears are still drying as I type this. I don't know if the developper will ever see this, but if he does, I just want to say this was beautiful and perfect and so much more than I imagined and hoped for. Your son and your story will inspire so many people because of your wonderful game, and Joel will be eternal both here on earth and in heaven.",

You should know this game is not about how fun it's gameplay is, but rather how it's gameplay expresses what a family went through. This game is about hope, faith and above all, the fact that sometimes we have to accept the inevitable, even if we hope it won't be true. This game is about experiencing a very short life through poetry, imagery, visual art, recordings, everything that can be poured into your soul and your heart will be if you play this game. It is not about being the Green family and changing their outcome, it is about experiencing their struggle, and that is an expressiveness that can only be brought about in games. It is about loving Joel throughout the whole experience, even if you know you can't keep him. Yes, I recommend this game. I recommend this game to poets, gamers, artists, and anyone who holds hope close to their heart.",

If you want to know more about the family, I recommend watching the documentary 'Thank you for playing', about the family and game creation process, or visit the game and family websites.   The game certainly provides a unique experience compared to any other thing in Steam  About the gameplay, I would not classify it as an adventure nor as a walking simulator, since there are no puzzles and you can`t freely walk around. The game is more like a visual novel.   However, the interface did its job but could be improved. There are certain moments that you don`t know what you have to do, and some scenes that you need to wait a certain amount of time to progress, but you don`t know that and keep trying clicking on stuff that won`t work (this was specially true on scene 11 and the scene of the carrousel). Another problem is that the game doesn`t hint you on what objects you can interact. In scene 2 I went straight forward and just after watching the documentary I realized I could interact with the kid on the playground; on scene 11 I took time to realize that I needed to click on a specific object to advance. I wonder what else I missed.  Another problem is that my monitor has an aspect ratio of 21:9 and the game won`t work on any monitor in this resolution. Checking the forums they said to set it to a 16:9 resolution, but I was not able to do that within the game; after more research I found a command line that I need to add on the Steam properties for this game.",
