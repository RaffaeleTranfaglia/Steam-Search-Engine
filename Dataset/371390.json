Pro: Steam cards Great for little kids In bundles Once you get the hang of it, it's fairly easy   Con: No steam overlay - had to bypass to get screen shots Was actually a 1983 game. Not sure if this is a rip-off or a remake $3.29 (CDN) LOL Not much to this game   Overall: 5/10 -1 price -1 'remake' -1 not much to it +1 kid friendly +1 steam cards = 4/10 Get this game free in a bundle or when it's $0.50 or less This is a kill 10 min casual game. Don't expect Witcher 3.  Steam you need a thumbs sideways.  Thumbs up since I got it in a bundle for next to nothing and I could have sold the cards for a profit.",

You can only jump left or right, controlling the power of your jump with a power meter. The controls are good enough to make this enjoyable. The game really doesn't have much substance either.   Should be free. Or never created.     Accidently Reviewed",
