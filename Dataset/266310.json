            "review_text": "I got this software for $8.99 and after watching the first Twitch video on making games, I made my 6 year old son a really simple shooter that contained zombies, barbarians, and several bazooka guys. He said it was the best game ever and is hounding me to make more levels. As a dad and a guy who likes to be creative, this is fantastic! There are some issues I ran into. A lot of them are probably due to the ancient laptop I'm using. My mouse pointer seems to be offset by a considerable margin and this makes it difficult to highlight things. I also cannot play standalone versions of games on my laptop because of an error I keep getting--but it works fine on my son's desktop computer. Finally, there is some issue where I keep getting into situations where pressing the W key focuses tighter rather than moving up. This is really frustrating. But I'm sure these issues are mostly to do with my computer specs and that this program will work just fine on a newer laptop/desktop. For reference, I have used GameMaker Pro, RPG Maker, and have attempted to learn some basic Python and Java. All of these have proved frustrating and I never really got anywhere (I have a full-time job and thus cannot devote too much time to this hobby). I certainly never got as far as I did afte a couple of hours with this software. I think the authors have done a terrific job and I am excited to see what new features/revisions they make to this program!",

            "review_text": "Where to start with this software? Well let's start with the Pros, - Easy to use (I set up a test level in about 5 minutes, I got used to it MUCH quicker than Unity), - Smart A.I system (You can set paths, they can find you when walking around securing the area, AND they can shoot you), - Character Generator (This is the reason I loved RPG Maker VX Ace so much, you don't have to spend 4 hours creating a good looking character, think of what you want to see, find the clothes, move a few sliders to perfect it and voila a cool looking character in about 10 seconds), - Easy stacking (I know it may not sound like much but believe me, when making something ontop of a table, it is SO simple, I remember FPS Creator didn't have that), - When making a steep hill, it creates rocks automatically (again, may not sound like much but, try making a rocky cliff by hand, it's not easy, this does basically the same thing the Cry Engine does, after a certain angle it creates a rock texture), Okay, time for Cons, - Beefy computer needed (I have a decent computer nothing special, but the game lags on lowest settings so yes, you need an upgraded computer), - One level games (One thing I liked about FPS Creator was the fact you could make 1924 levels and EVERY level and I mean EVERY level would be put into the files, this you get a level, I went to create a game where you had to infiltrate a building and it would do a level transition from outdoors to the building interior, and found it only exports one level, just what I wanted The Game Creators), - The actual game runs even slower (This is an even MORE annoying thing than the last two Cons combined, because I went to load up a level that aparently passes for an .exe file, and the menu alone lagged, didn't think much of it until I pressed 'Start', it went to the loading screen, said 'Not Responding' and needless to say, I never got to play that game). Okay, so the Cons kind of outweigh the Pros (not in numerical value, in how annoying or good something is), but if you're a new game developer and have a good computer and no knowledge of programming, I suggest you start here, you can even play multiplayer games!",

Take a look back at FPScreator x9 and all that had to offer. This may be limited now, but do NOT forget to take into account the very simple and blatantly advertised fact that this is EARLY ACCESS. It is still being developed. If they manage to make this like x9 with the menu features and extensive available asset libraries, what we will have is a fully functional drag and drop fps creation program on a proffesional level with no programming required. With all the added cool features they've developed it should be ground breaking. I would say it already kind of is.   Be patient. It already looks great. AND they've added a third person view. I haven't tested that yet. I am hoping that this ends up going beyond the scope of first person shooters, but if that's what we get, with an updated graphics engine, I'll take it at this price. The ability to slam games together with some minimal texturing, and perhaps some basic modeling. Maybe a bit of coding in the end, but not very much, and we can sell the games? For this price? Good stuff. I can't wait to see what the finished product looks like.",

            "review_text": "I have been having so much fun playing with this software, I figured I should tell the world my feelings about it. I love its concept. Its like modding a game map only the other party doesnt need to own the same game to play your mod. Its not perfect by any means and I have ran into some issues. But Im sure the developers will correct them in time. This software allows alot of creativity to be released with minimum effort. It amazes me how much time one can spend on a single map. Its fun. I actually enjoy sculpting maps and placing entities with this software. The engine is pretty decent graphics wise. LUA scripting was new to me as a language but seems easy to use now. The community it freaking awesome. I love how this Software and the community store allows 3d model artists an outlet to sell or give away their creations. I support the art community as should you. Talent should not be wasted. The developers are very active and at times entertaining. I can tell that they love their own product and actually use it in their own game creations. I dont like to give reviews on a product with out actually spending some time using it first. I figured 500 plus hours was enough time. I use several programs and engines on other projects and this one is pretty easy to use as far as 3D environments are concerned.   One can make a simple game with no coding. One can make an elaborate heavily scripted game as well with coding. If you can make your own 3D assets/entities to put inside your game projects 3D environment made with GameGuru, then You have a winner as far as unique game design goes. The availiable assets are pretty nice but everyone is using them lol including myself. I purchased all the DLC's. I want it all. and it supports the developers and the community as well if you buy their 3rd party assets. If you love something, spend some money on it. I hope this Software reaches and fullfills the expectations that the developers and the community are striving for. I really enjoy it. It really does feel like you are playing a game while making one. That is a unique feeling. I have only been using this software a short time and its already been updated once with much improvment. I am sure some Indie developers might dislike this software as it could flood the market with alot more 3d games to become availiable. We all know it is hard enough to get a game noticed in todays market but hey, we all have dreams and we all should have the chance to share and fullfill them with everyone. I believe this software can do just that very thing.  I almost forgot to mention, I love the ragdoll physics in this engine. A friend pointed out that in most 1st person shooters, when you kill someone, they just fall straight down to the ground. He liked how the human opponents when shot and killed would fly backwards and into the air,down stairs, over rails and cliffs etc in the game I had created. I laughed and said, that was GameGuru's built in ragdoll physics engine. I wouldnt have it any other way.  In conclusion I would advise anyone who has even the slightest interest in this software to...  'Purchase it!' lol. The worst scenario is you spent 5 hours or less on it and had zero creative ideas while using it. If true then chances are very high that brain wave activity has ceased and such person is most likely in a coma. I have spent more time playing with this software and less money than I have with most of the other engines/software/games installed on my pc. To me, using GameGuru has been fun, fun, fun, and everyone needs more of that in life. :)",

Also updated dlc. you don't really need to learn how to script since most of what the new people want are simple scripts that have been made at least twice so all you need to know is how to plug them into the engine. I would recommend this if you want to make A multiplayer arena based games, or even single player survival/fps games. If you can model, animate and get them in the engine you will probably prosper here, the models are one of the most needed things in my oppinion, since scripting is pretty easy. I give this engine. 11/10 would make another game with this engine again.",

When I got it from the Humble Bundle, I expected more FPS Creator, but that isn't really the case with GameGuru.  First off I will mention the things that FPSC x9 had, but GameGuru doesn't(or at least in a easily accessible way)  * Easily customizable menus and HUD  * Segment and CSG brush system (building indoor levels in GameGuru is HARD, you also can't get rid of the terrain)  * The R key did not rotate entities for me, which means that I couldn't get accurate 90 or 45 degree angles.  * There is no snap-to-grid functionality as far as I can see  * There is no assault rifle included in the default model pack (such a nitpick)  * I couldn't seem to find a way to change any of the water properties like height or reflectivity/refractivity/color GameGuru just doesn't feel like FPSC, but it still has the same interface.  I will still give GameGuru a positive review because I believe that TGC will be providing long term support of GG, just like they did with FPSC (just compare V1 with what we have now), and hopefully implementing many of the features that are missing from FPSC. Damn I would really love a system for easy indoor levels *wink wink, nudge nudge*.",

You can get instant visual results with this package, straight away without having to read manuals or have any background in modelling or coding.  Now its 3 months later and I am enjoying it more each day. I recommend this package to anyone from the first time gamer to, wannabe game makers, like myself.  You can create your own 3d models and use them in game with ease. The scripting language is easy to learn and comprehend, it basically a descriptive logic language. I recommend that you also learn how to do 3d modelling and scripting as well.  To gain an all-round enjoyable experience. I also do recommend that you put some time into exploring and understanding how the package works. This will give you the realisation that this package has great current and future potential.  Don’t be afraid of editing files and scripts to understand how things work. If you break something you can just re-download a new set and start over, but its best to work off a copy of the original files. This has been the best value for money purchase i have every made. I also need to make special mention the generosity of the community and the developers and moderators in the forums support, and the stores. It is exceptional, there is always someone around and prepared to help you out with any issues. Make sure you take the time to browse the forums. There is a wealth of information within the forums. Not to mention 1000's of free 3D models made by the community members and there are 100's of scripts for free as well. Enjoy.",

I will however begin with a recommendation, as I do believe in software that sparks peoples interests in computers, and using them in exiting ways. But like I said, a proper review is coming up. But it will take a few days. Ahem.. or maybe a bit longer. Been bitten by the Fallout 4 bug. Don't know how long it will take me to recover from that :)  Finally getting over Fallout 4 :) So I have tested this. First, I think this application have improved since first time I saw it. No point in listing those issues, just to say that it is better now. However, I have a rather major issue with lighting. When creating an empty scene and then playing it, I am surrounded by darkness (no light) and to occasional flashing of the immediate terrain. As if the first LOD range have lighting, but it only flashes into existance on occasion. Same thing happens when playing the demo scenes. This time there is light, but it flashes, with darkness. I think the issue is the same in both cases. But it seems to be light in the demos, due to the scenes being more busy with details. With the empty scene, whatever causes the blackness (perhaps occlusion?) have sufficient time to make everything dark. Maybe it is a driver issue with nVidia &amp; my GTX 780 card? If this is a more common issue, then it needs immediate attention, because it will be impossible to do anything when this is going on. Aside from that the idea is good. However, to really push the bar up, there needs to be a working (as in reasonable) AI included. As well as some more high quality content. Because most people will compare by visuals, regardless if the program is capable enough or not. Having it present something similar (visually) to Team fortress 2, would help it a long way. From my experimentation, I think it is possible. But it requires that they also put in the added effort to include at least one such demo. All in all, I think it is interesting, and promising. So I recommend it for people wanting to play around, and get some experience creating things. But the lighting issue is (in my book) a high priority issue to fix.",

Just like FPSC, this game allows you to create pretty simple games, levels etc with small effort, or something more advanced if you know some coding. Anyway, It is very limited, and has quite small amount of assets to use, and many of those are DLC.   It's fun to create small joke game to share with our friends, but i doubt anyone would make full game with this.",

If you ever wanted to make a Game and u didn't know where to start - you could do it here.   Needless to say, there are two very popular alternatives for this. Unreal Engine and Cry Engine, so why choosing this to begin? Because making your own map, for example, is, in my opinion, here very easy. And there is much more about learning how you should design a level.   The K.I. is not that good, but that's not the Point. If you only want to play a shooter, go buy yourself Counter Strike. But if you want to begin with making games, this is the right tool for you!",

It still could run better, as I have compared my system spec to the minimum and recommended. I meet the minimum specs, but only some of the recommended...  The product its self is perfect. Only wish that there were a bit more features... The Asset store is somewhat full of features, but most of them cost a bit of $$$ to get.  I would say that this product is perfect for new developers. The coding involved is a whopping 0! This is what I have been looking for. If you don't know how to code, then this product is for you. Thank you GameGuru team for making such a great product.  If I may add, the one feature that I would highly request is Buildings Creator. Like the character creator, but you can create buildings, both decoration and buildings you can walk into. Any developers who think I need to post this in the forums, please request to do so. I am new to steam and am not sure if the devs look at this too much. Thanks for creating an awesome game engine, and I look foward to seeing it improve. Keep it up!",

The Gamrguru community is one of the best i have ever had the pleasure of belonging too, someone is always there ready to help. I am not a programmer but he LUA scripting is very easy to get to grips with and there are plenty of scripts on the forums free to use.  Gameguru is a product that will give you hours of endless fun sure its not a finished product but its well worth getting now there are always updates plus it gives you the chance to grow with the software and help mold it into a product you would like to use you can vote for features you would like to see in the finished product.  Buy it use it play it grow with it  ",

The graphics are great, there are so many decorations and buildings to add, lots of characters, good and bad! There are characters for horror games, FPS's, RPG games and so much more! There are modern buildings for your present day adventures, older, gothic buildings for the typical RPG, and buildings with an atmosphere to give you chills for you terrifying horror games! Not to mention they are all drag and drop. It even comes with a built in terrain editor, plus with paint tools to edit the land, to make sand, mountains, and hills. There are also weapons for your fighting games or shooting games. You can also make multiplayer maps for you and your friends! This tool is so powerful that it's also make a No Man's Sky styled game! The bad things are that there are too many DLC's that restrict what you have, there are also micro-transactions, and your friends NEED to have GameGuru to play your multiplayer maps. You can slo publish your games for people to buy them, or you could put them onto a flash-drive to share with your friends! I am rating GameGuru 8.7/10",

            "review_text": "I give this 'Game' a 5 out of 10, it's worth buying on sale but I don't understand how anyone could spend hundreds of dollars on all the DLC.   The editor is fun, easy and quick to learn. With no coding being a plus but restrictions to customization being a con. You can only use 4 terrians types at a time as far as I can figure, there are lots of terrians types but they are all grouped together with no clear way to seperate them. The terrian tools are very limited too, making a realistic mountain is near impossilbe if not very very time consuming. Making a river is pretty easy but your character cannot swim, you will die the second your head goes under water. On the good side there are alot of trees and quite a few different style buildings but there are not enough of each style, any town or city you build will look very generic with the same 3-5 buildings repeating.  When it comes to actual gameplay which if you ask me the way this is set up the whole thing is gameplay since the editor is much like a game with how limited it actually is (there needs to be sliders and more terrian options to feel like an actual editor). The shooter A.I. are ok, they shoot back and can take cover where you tell them to but the zombies are HORRIBLE! and not at all in a good way. If you put a zombie in an open field it will chase you once you get within 10 yards of it which at that point you will be able to hit it with a shotgun so using a pistol or smg the zombies won't even know what hit them, literallly. If you put a zombie in a forest it likely won't even move even if you get to within inches of it. The Melee A.I. just move too slow, I only hve played with one of these so maybe some of the others move faster than a slow walk but fact is you won't feel very pressured by any of the A.I. even the shooters are so bad that unless there are 3 or more shooting at you or one is using the rocket launcher you will easily be able to walk right in front of them and cap the A.I. in the head.  I will change my recommendation if the zombies are improved and if some more terrian options are added (i.e. more than four terrians types at a time and different paint brushes such as spray painter and other gradiants.) For now tho I am going to have to give this a thumbs down, If you buy it on sale then I would say have some fun and just don't expect too much but do not buy this game at full price.",

            "review_text": "I've updated my review again to say that the devs of the program are determined to make this a great tool but at the moment it is still pretty weak. You can't do a whole lot with it yet and even if they say they updated it so there isn't so much 'hard-code' that is simply not the case. I warn others to stay away from this software for now. The devs continuously talk to me about changing my review but there isn't a whole ton of stuff really changing yet like they claim. Yes, they did add some new features and added a bit more customization but it still feels like I am simply making maps for a game already made. That is it. I cannot recommend this software at this time but I can't just say not to get it because it does continuously improve.  Sidenote: I purchased all of the dlc for the program, tons of store content, and still haven't been able to even touch most of it because I hate the idea of working on a project only to know that it will not be anything I can actually put out there at the moment because all the content has yet to be added to the engine itself. That's annoying to me.  PUT THAT IT IS EARLY ACCESS",
