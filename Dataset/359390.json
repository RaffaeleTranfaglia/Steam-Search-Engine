What I liked: - The character art is stunningly beautiful. - The voice acting was very good. I loved that it was original Japanese. - The mystery for each route is very different.  - Orion is adorable - It's an otome game which I think Steam needs more of.  What I wish was better: - Parameter system is hard to interpret.  - Backgrounds were monocolored. Not very detailed but that's probably because they focus the attention on the main characters. - More save points! Other visual novels can have hundreds of save points. This one has only 24. Considering how many choices you have to make, I think there should be more.  Overall I would recommend if you like visual novels and you don't mind reading.",

This game is not related to the horror game Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs, this is an entirely different game.    Crazy boys, gorgeous art and some mystery.",

With the help of a young spirit, you must navigate the world around you in order to figure out who your enemies are and who you can trust.   This is a wonderful game and I sincerely hope that we start to get more translations of popular Japanese otome games on here. Every route in Amnesia is completely different, so at no point was I bored reading through the stories. Highly recommended.  The Romance Options: -Diamond: Toma - aka Mr. Yandere, was extremely disturbing. Not my cup of tea, but the other routes made up for his storyline.  -Heart: Shin - a childhood friend and a storyline that plays out like a detective story. This one was my favorite out of all the stories. I loved Shin, which was unexpected. Going into the game I had expected to like Ikki the best.  -Spade: Ikki - a playboy who has a 'condition' where anyone who looks into his eyes falls in love with him. An interesting story that I enjoyed, even if I wanted to shake Ikki most of the time.  -Clubs: Kent - aka the Vulcan option. If you think Spock is hot, then Kent'll be right up your ally. This is probably the one route that was straight romance without a major plot thread involving murder mysteries, supernatural abilities, or crazy yandere boyfriends.  -Joker: I don't want to give much away for this route. All I'll say is that I enjoyed this one a lot. It ties together all of the storylines you've read by the time you get to this point.",

I happen to have gotten the game 90% off, but after playing this nonstop for the past few days...I definitely would've payed the full $30. The art is beautiful and the storylines are absolutely captivating. I kept playing, not wanting to sleep later at night, because I wanted to know what would happen next. The mystery aspects are executed so nicely and I loved seeing things I remembered seeing in the anime. Currently I've only unlocked two good endings and a normal, but I can't wait to get the other endings and see how everything unfolds. I'm sure even the bad endings will be unforgettable.",

Each route has its own compelling story line, all of which is fully voiced over *melts* and features beautiful artwork as expected from a visual novel.  Amnesia was my first otome game purchase on Steam and I've enjoyed many hours squealing in my chair as potential husbands try to woo me. I've only completed one route so far, however I look forward to completing the rest. It's definitely a game worth getting especially if you enjoy an interesting story with beautiful art and voice overs!",

Any otome fan or visual novel fan is sure to like this one, it is probably the best otome game I've played, and the localization team did excellent work.  The premise of the story is that you play as a nameable heroine who has had an encounter with an otherworldly being and as a result of that, she loses all her memories. The story is told in a very interesting way compared to most visual novels as you choose the character route at the beginning of the game, and the goal of the game being to get that character's best possible ending. (All characters have bad endings, normal endings, and good endings.)  One of my favourite things about Amnesia: Memories was that it really builds on the characters as you play, and you sympathize with the heroine as just like her you know nothing about the bachelors and have to learn about them. There was a particular bachelor that I started out hating, and the heroine didn't care much for either - but as you gain her memories back you start to gain insight into these characters and begin to care for them - with this, the game does a great job of putting you in her shoes.  In short, I honestly recommend this game if you're looking for a great otome game with cute anime boys, pretty visuals, and great music. I hope we get to see more otome games in the future! Thank you Idea Factory International!",

            "review_text": "I've played many visual novels. This one doesn't have any gratuitous nudity or sex scenes. Now that half of you have probably stopped reading I have to say this was an interesting game. This time you play a girl and have the option of getting to know 4 unique guys . I have to say the whole amnesia aspect was interesting. As you are interacting with each guy you have to recover your memories and the feelings you had for them while not letting them know you've lost your memories.   I found myself invested in each story more than I'd ever care to admit. In such a way that you start to have favorites. The guys all have distinct personalities in how they act with you. Some are pushy, while others are cold and indifferent. As they warm up to you and get more familiar you find yourself warming up to them and you learn that they're not as heartless their initial personality.   There is an underlying mystery that includes one secret guy who you can only play out once you've finished the ending of each of the main 4. This is a little more scary as you will discover him in other play throughs and adds a bit of horror element to the game. There are 3 types of endings, good, normal and bad. Bad usually ends with your death and you'll see it coming once the music changes. And boy does that music send chills down your spine once it starts and you realize that something bad is going to happen you can't help but feel a bit of terror.   While the entire game is spoken in Japanese there is an option to skip or fast forward a lot of the seen dialogue so subsequent playthroughs are quicker. And to get all the endings you're going to have to replay quite a bit. There's a bit of trial and error in balancing out your relationships and sometimes the choices you're presented with aren't so clear as to what outcome it will lead. Despite that I enjoyed the story and diverse personalities of the guys you date. You should play this if you are a fan of VNs otherwise without the sex and nudity I think it wouldn't be for everyone.",

I do understand though that people are able to tell from what's fantasy and what's not (like for example: Diabolik Lovers cause they play up the yandere stuff like a lot but it's a lot more obvious unlike this game), so I totally get if you're into this thing.

            "review_text": "It's not often that you'll hear me, of all people, make a statement like this, but I genuinely feel bad that I got this game at such a high discount. I bought Amnesia when it was 90% off for the winter sale, and it's certainly one of the best visual novels I've ever played.   For one thing, this game is just incredibly well-made. Now, a good 90% of the visual novels I've played have been freeware ones I've found online across various forums. None of them have had particularly high production values or anything like that; at most they've feature a couple of CGs and a bonus scene or some questions answered by the creator about their game, but besides that they're pretty basic. To get a game with so many CGs, which are remarkably well-drawn and colored; voice acting; an awesome soundtrack (I may or may not have gotten about 60-65% of my playing hours for this game by just leaving it open while I did other stuff on my computer in different windows, just because I really liked the music); mini-games (albeit ones with rather poor controls in several cases, though that may be due to my mouse being particularly terrible); and over 20 different endings is a completely new experience for me. It's been somewhat hard for me to go back to playing games without most of these nice features, or at least where these features aren't as well done as they are in Amnesia. I feel like I stole something by getting a game this nice for only three dollars.  But speaking of all of those endings I mentioned, let me discuss the actual routes and characters, since they make up a bulk of the game's experience. The routes are set in different alternate 'worlds', each of which is named after suits on playing cards. Please note that you should probably play the routes in the order they're listed as choices; I made the mistake of playing Toma's route first, since he was the only character I was curious about going in, and I can't help but feel like I would've enjoyed the game that much more if I had just chosen his route last. (In Shin's route, at least, things become a *lot* more predictable once you know the sort of stunts Toma's capable of pulling.) Each route has a good end, a normal end, and several bad ends. Note: there's 5 routes to play, not 4, but the fifth is only unlockable after you've done the others.  Now onto the characters themselves. For the most part, I thought all the romanceable guys were pretty likeable and well-portrayed. Not all of them strike me as 'boyfriend' material, but nonetheless, every one of them was quite interesting in his own right. While the guys are essentially stock otome love interests- we have a blunt tsundere with a heart of gold, a chivalrous playboy whose only *sincere* romantic interest is in you (the heroine), a logical and seemingly cold (but entirely adorkable) nerd, and a yandere willing to do anything to protect you- they're all either played to perfection or with an interesting twist on the usual 'type'.   My personal favorite character is Ikki, which says a lot, since I typically dislike the 'playboy' type (if I don't ignore them as an option altogether). But Ikki was sweet and had quite a bit more depth to his character than I was expecting, and several times I really wanted to hug him because I felt so badly for him. That said, I don't think I actually disliked any of the love interests, at least not in retrospect. Some of them made me very frustrated, and some of the routes were outright morally compromising (I'm looking at you, Toma), but they were really enjoyable overall. Hell, Toma's route was the first one I wanted to replay- I don't like him as a love interest, particularly, but he was damn entertaining.  And while I haven't said anything about Ukyo, he was a different sort of character than I've dealt with in any otome game before. I'm still not quite sure what to make of his route. I will once again offer a bit of advice and say this: DO NOT LOOK UP ANYTHING RELATED TO UKYO UNTIL YOU'VE PLAYED THROUGH HIS ROUTE AT LEAST ONCE. Once again, I made the mistake of spoiling the twist with him before I even unlocked his route, which took away a lot of his charm for me. Instead, playing through his route was something of a drag because I didn't have to piece together any of his cryptic statements or anything.  This whole review has turned into one long TL;DR, so I'll say this in conclusion: Amnesia was a thoroughly enjoyable game. Even the characters who I didn't particularly like as love interests were quite entertaining regardless, and this is certainly the most professional, well-presented otome game- or visual novel in general- that I've ever played. I probably would've liked it even more had I not spoiled some major aspects of the story for myself, but even given that, Amnesia totally won me over. I'd love to see more on Steam from Idea Factory in the future.      ",

But since the game was insanely cheap during the sale, I decided to buy it and I didn't regret it.  You play a girl who has lost her memories. And depending on which 'world' you choose during the prologue, you're the target attention of a certain guy. Your goal is to try and recover your lost memories without letting anyone on to you having amnesia.   There are 5 guys, each with their own route. In order to unlock the 5th guy's route you have to get the 'Good Endings' for the 4 other routes.   The guys in the game are pretty likeable. At the start of each route, I was like 'wtf who the ♥♥♥♥ are you' but by the end of each route, I ended up really liking each guy.   Each of the guys have their own personalities: Shin- The guy who acts like he doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥, but he actually does give a ♥♥♥♥ Toma- The guy who acts like your older brother, but secretly wants the V.  Ikki- The ladies man Kent- The nerd who is awkward as ♥♥♥♥ in a relationship Ukyo- The guy with a double personality.   Personally, Shin is my favorite (and so is his route).   The art and music are both BEAUTIFUL. 10/10   There's also 2 mini-games you can play (by selecting them on the title screen): Rock-paper-scissors and Air Hockey. Unfortunatley, the air-hockey doesn't work for me because it lags a lot :/ The rock-paper-scissors is kinda fun, but I only played it to get the achievements. :P  Overall, I enjoyed the game. I did find some of the routes a bit boring, though. I really liked Shin's, Toma's, and Ukyo's route, but I found Ikki's and Kent's a bit boring at times. I still did enjoy them though. :) Now I might try watching the anime series because I heard it's not as confusing if you've played the game.

However, the meters in the game have very much been only a decoration, since they do not help you at all most of the time. The best example of that is Toma.  For your first playing time, you should choose anyone but Toma. Trust me, his path is not logical at all, and you may end up having a frustrative bad ending even if you do not set it as your goal. You may want to enjoy the other, better routes at first.  The four different characters are all very different. Toma is secretive and shows his kind mask, Shin is a bit of a cool delinquent, who is very smart and amazing sometimes. Ikki is a womanizer on the outside, but he has more to it. Kent is sosially very thick-headed, but clever as a mathbook. And needless to say, your companion spirit-boy Orion is very entertaining with all the comments and funny faces he does. He really adds more to the game.  Also, the starting music is awesome and the soundtrack is nicely supporting the athmosphere. The artwork is neatly done.

Basically: Art: 10/ 10 Story: 7/10 (Kent's route is the most i love out of them all)  If you guys want a nice art with awesome and hooking story then i suggest 'The Second Reproduction'. One of my most favorite otome game ever.",

The mystery and drama surrounding all of the characters is enough to draw in even those who are not into the romantic aspect of it, but do be warned it is in fact heavily based in romance.  It is a fairly linear game, but it makes up for it by having three ends (good, neutral, bad) for every guy and a lot of unlockables.  The character art is fairly good but the rest of the art is pretty lacking. You'll be seeing a lot of the same blurry backdrops over and over, but the engaging story more than makes up for it.  Unravel the mystery of who you are and fall in love over and over again.  I strongly recommend this game to anyone and everyone as long as you're able to get it at a reasonable price.

            "review_text": "[Disclaimer: In no way, shape, or form was I compensated for the composition or publication of this review. This by my own volition. A review copy of the game was kindly provided by Ideal Factory International.]  Developed by Idea Factory under its Otome game brand Otomate, Amnesia: Memories is among one of the companies pioneering titles that finally gets a western release. And while Otoge or Otome games are meant to cater specifically toward a female audience, a male audience can also partake of them. The story puts players into the shoes of an unnamed female protagonist that has lost her memories after a strange incident. With help of mysterious young boy named Orion, the two work together to help make sense of the heroine’s past life, while trying not raise suspicion from friends and a boyfriend she never knew existed.  With Amnesia: Memories actually being my first Otome game and looking that is from the perspective of a newcomer, I do think that first timers like myself or those completely new to visual novels in general will be able to navigate it easily. For one, before you even start to meet the eligible bachelors, you will be able to choose who you want to interact with from the start by choosing a world – each holding a symbolic card corresponding to that person. You have the aloof Shin of the “Heart” world, playboy Ikki of the “Spade” world, his logical best friend Kent of “Club” world, and the big brother figure Toma of “Diamnond” world. There is a fifth guy and the route that puts all this into perspective, but needs to be unlocked by completing the others. Not only do each the routes play out differently depending on the world, but also changes how certain people will treat you. For instance, Waka, the manager at the place the herione works at is very nice in the “Heart” route, but his personality does shift greatly in others – going from docile to abrasive. This does apply to the other characters you meet as well to varying degrees, and serves as a nice change of pace to see how each route differs despite the feature being nothing new to visual novels.  Even though the main love interest and their personalities play into the typical paradigm most shoujo anime seems to reach for, I did honestly enjoy exploring the backstories of the guys I did go after. My favorite character would have to be the titular Shin, learning the reason behind his distant attitude that stems from a past event with his father. The writing is very simple in many ways and not that great when it comes to giving the story some interesting twist and turns, but still okay in its own right. The individual routes are fine on their own, but overall does fall short of being particularly great. That’s all I can offer on the subject without spoiling it. By the same admission, the characters themselves also aren’t as detailed as they could be, but still found them interesting. Especially in the case of Toma. Yup, very… fascinating personality shift for that guy.  Getting back to gameplay, the same orthodox process of reading text and making decisions at certain points become the norm like most visual novels, with one exception. Keeping with the theme of trying to piece together your life without letting your boyfriend be any wiser, the choices you make do have implications on 3 values: “Affection”, “Trust”, and “Suspicion”. The goal of is to ideally get a “Good” or “Normal” ending by keeping your Affection and Trust values high and Suspicion low. Again, depending on the choices, these values will fluctuate, so it is important to be mindful of what choices you make and keep tabs on your parameter menu frequently. Often or not, it is pretty easy to know how to response, yet can abuse the system by saving your game and seeing how a certain choice goes. In the event that you do have your Suspicion high, the game will continue, but will be able to get a bad ending more easily from making a wrong choice or simply getting the normal ending for that route if you happen to make it through successfully. Since replay value is a big part of games of this nature, it doesn’t hurt and obvious that making multiple saves will offer some assistance.  When you tire of trying to get through the story or even completed the game, besides viewing the CG library for illustrations, listening to tracks, or keeping track of the endings you received, the game does have two mini-games you can play at anytime: Rock-paper-scissors and Air hockey. There not the most interesting thing in the world, but it’s there if you need it as a brief diversion. I would like to detail this section, but since I never actually won a game, I will leave the outcome of what happens (if anything) to be a surprise.  On the aesthetic side of things, the artwork and animation for the game is very impressive. In a lot ways, the color scheme and style used kind of reminds me of that found in Steins;Gate, despite not having the same exact appearance or as drab. Animations are crisp and lively, and actually show off a lot of technical muscle such as changing the characters sprite angles (seeing them from the side or back) that really makes them come alive without having to go toward excess. My favorite animation would have to be of Ikki holding his signature sunglasses and smoothly slipping them on in the same scene almost like it was in one movement. The musical score is very genteel and well-done, piano pieces being the most prominent holding up the sentimental mood – that admittedly, tends get lost at various times. By the time you get through half of the routes it will become droning, yet mildly tolerable.  With visual novels gaining more acceptance and familiarity in the West, I do believe titles like Amnesia: Memories will be great boon for its biggest supporters. It definitely isn’t the cream of crop, especially when it comes to the overall writing, but still fairly remarkable in other areas like presentation and making that presentation work for it during the course of the game. While it won’t be for a couple of months until see Idea Factory’s other Otome offerings, Amnesia is a pretty pleasant harbinger of what to expect and do think this one will keep most fans satisfied for the time being.

I honestly am not sure who in their right minds would think that this would be a good romantic story. It's a romance story turned into horror. All of the guys do problematic things at one point or another, but they're usually small things that can be overlooked and one can still enjoy the story. Toma's story is just wrong in so many ways that it's sickening that it was even in the game. Honestly, the best part about Toma's story was the normal ending, because the main character gets to escape him.  In one of the bad endings,   Toma has the main character in chains, literally just a bunch of chains. Her memory is completely gone and she's dressed in a maid outfit. There's also the insinuation that he does whatever he wants with her, probably including r/a/p/e.   Just to give you an idea of how horrifying this whole thing is.  If you get the game, please get it on sale and if you have experience with abusive relationships, I truly don't recommend going through Toma's story.  Otherwise, the game was interesting and fun to go through. It's such a shame that such a good game has been tarnished by one story in it.",

            "review_text": "Amnesia : Memories is a wonderful visual novel that I highly recommend. The basic premise is that you as the main character are suffering amnesia, as well as basically a spiritual possession, and are attempting to regain your memories and free the spirit from your mind.   There are 5 total romanceable characters, all male. The first 4 are available as soon as you start the game, the fifth one unlocks after finishing the good endings for the first 4 characters. All of them have 1 good ending, 1 normal ending and between 1 and 7 bad endings. They are all very well defined characters, with elaborate stories and very very different personalities. You have a tsundere, a popular/playboy who yearns for real love, an intellectual who's aloof and bad with emotions and socializing, and 2 yandere characters that are on opposite ends of the yandere spectrum. Each one of their stories take place on alternate dimensions, so even though the basic story premise is the same for each, the stories themselves are completely different and the side characters will sometimes have vastly different personalities in each route. As a fair warning, if you are someone who needs trigger warnings, you may have problems with one of the routes.  Getting the different endings requires making different selections during the story branches. Each selection will either raise, lower, or leave your attributes in their current level of accumulation. There is no stat raising or grinding, it's just a matter of selecting conversation options to raise or lower your trust, relationship and suspicion with each character. There are quite a lot of branches, and it felt like there should have been more save slots available because of how many choices you have available.  The art is absolutely beautiful, the music and voice acting is great and fits in very well, the stories and characters are well written, and the translation is very accurate - though there are a very few spelling and grammar errors, it doesn't stick out horribly or detract from the experience. After beating all the stories and endings there are also mini games, additional memories and short stories that follow up with the characters, leaving a huge amount of content in this game, it's really surprising how much content the game offers.  Pros: +5 very different romanceable characters +so many endings +mini games +unlockable bonus content +art +music +story +a 12 episode anime series you can watch elsewhere if the game isn't enough for you  Slightly Irritating: ~a few spelling/grammatical errors ~no obvious exit option in game  ~while you can customize controls, it doesn't tell you what the buttons do ~for some people the achievements aren't working (IF is currently working on fixing it) ~a character who goes too far ~could use more save slots  Cons: -I can't really think of anything outright negative about this game. :)  If you like anime and/or visual novels I really recommend you pick up this game, it is definitely worth the money, even at full price!",

I went into the game figuring the game would be standard otome fare, but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's actually very well written, supplemented with good art and sound. Each of the routes had their own particular charms, which surprised me, and my own expectations of which routes I'd prefer turned out to be totally wrong due to the strength of the story and the characterizations.  Localization for the game is very good. For me, poor localization, typos, and awkward phrasing completely breaks immersion for me in visual novels. In Amnesia, I can't even remember any awkward phrases, and I found only two typos during my entire playthrough.   The game does suffer from situations where the protagonist's actions (or lack thereof) defy common sense, though the use of Orion, her onboarded spirit, actually does help. Orion tends to embody a lot of the inner dialogue (and outrage) of the gamer, embodying sentiments such as 'how dare he say that!' that the protagonist unfortunately doesn't really ever act upon. Amnesia also suffers from the common visual novel ailment where as the player it can be virtually impossible to know how to avoid bad ends. There were thankfully less of these than in some other games I've played, but I did find it often frustrating how a single choice led to a bad end that the game gave me no reasonable clues to predict. Similarly, I found the good ends frustrating to get because they didn't really follow obvious choice paths.  Overall though, Amnesia is definitely worth the asking price. It has many hours of gameplay and for any otome fans out there, it's one of the highest quality otome games I've played here in the West. When playing, I couldn't put it down and basically marathoned the game for a week, and was left wanting more. (Please bring the sequels to the West, Idea Factory!!).",

Though the anime is cool, this visual novel is better.   You get to be up close and personal, actually feeling what the character you play feels throughout it. In the anime, the main character seems dull and boring, since she doesn't really have memory to have a personality. But in this visual novel you can choose what sort of personality your character has!   Though the personality you give your character can lead her to trouble, eg Bad ends, it's nice to be yourself or follow a certain personality trait you like and see how that develops with characters!   Like with Kent, it was my first playhrough of the game, didn't know how it worked yet and decided to be myself in it. My character then had her first happy end! I was very happy with Kent. I think I like the intellectual (sp?) type - especially the ones who seem cold and distant, they seem lonely, and before I knew it I started falling in love with Clover!

I liked the 'alternate universes where you date a different guy in each one' idea, though, and that's why I played through it all. An interesting way to give meaning to the way you usually play these VNs over and over getting all the different endings, and the routes were quite different from one another unlike in some games. The plot wasn't super well-tied together at the end, but it was alright.  In conclusion, play this if you have a high tolerance for creepiness, otherwise you probably shouldn't.",

            "review_text": "TL;dr: For an otome, it is quite dark. So things get crazy pretty quick. You have many hours that you can put into the game, depending on how fast you read, it may vary. The characters are all unique in their own way, some more unexpected than others. The Art is very beautiful, followed along with very well chosen voice actors. The stories all can get you very involved and wanting more. Only bleh is some achievements suck and Orion constantly yappin'.  Recommend: To those who like Visual Novels, unique characters, romance, engaging stories, and pretty art.  ----------------------------------------------- Game: There are lots of hours that can be put into this game which is good when seeing the price on this game. You get also a lot of unlockable additional content which makes it more worthwhile. Such as memories and short stories in the boys' perspectives. Oh and mini-games which are pretty fun if you aren't in the mood for reading. Good amount of save slots, but in the end, I was wishing for more for Ukyo ~ n ~ Also is great that you can choose how it is read. You can turn on and off the V.A.'s, put it on Auto, Speed through text, show text and previous text all together, etc... Made it definitely a good experience. AND to make things better, if you're trying to get a different ending and playing through again, if you speed through, it will stop and play if there is text that you have previously not read in your other playthroughs! And it will highlight which answers you've already inputed. No trying to remember now :3   Achievements: Some of these achievemnts are literally so annoying I just gave up -.- One is where you have to click the image multiple times just for the guy to say a couple things. Looked up where to click and it still does absolutely nothing. Everyone, but Kent's, I have had difficulty getting one part of their picture to work, It is seriously the dumbest thing ever. &gt;_&gt; The others are easy to obtain.  Anime VS. Otome: I found out about the anime first then the otome. I'm happy I came across the otome because now I realize how BAD the anime is. The anime doesn't cover really anything, Like the first 5-10 mins of the boys' story in the otome, so it was nice to really get to delve into these boys stories way more than the anime ever did. Only thing is I kind of liked in the anime that Orion wasn't there 24/7. The otome he just literally drove me bonkers @ n @  Art: The art is very beautiful and definitely draws you in. Their character design is actually very well thought out and you see a bunch of tiny things that really bring everything together, Also with their personalities, it ties in with the design. They have different poses which are good as well. The only weird thing for me is how large some of their hands were... But the style and coloring is very pretty. The gallery has lots of pretty images that are saved from your specific route and you can even move around the picture and check out different areas of it. There was a lot of variety and ones you unlock just from completing certain acheivements. Though that stupid ctrl-left click thing for their 'hidden' message things were annoying. I'd click and it would end up going to the next image instead. I had an immensley hard time trying to get parts of an image to register. No matter how many times I clicked Toma's fist in the 2nd variation nothing happened, Shin and Heroine picture variation 2, her face would not react at all, Ikki and the heroine at the theatre, the hand wouldn't register. I've looked this stuff up to see if I'm just clicking slightly off, but I am clicking where I need it. So that part gets a 0 in my book because it was just frustrating.  Music: The music wasn't distracting and pretty good for the most part.  Characters: The characters all had variety and interesting endings, though some just seemed completely random at times. I wish there could have been more choices to choose from and Orion would STOP making decisions for me -.- I'm looking at Toma's route heavily when Orion becomes really annoying. Speaking of Toma,   I wish we could have learned more about why and when he started to have yandere tendencies. Just seeing his past with the heroine, it just seems odd that such a sweetie would now go nut-so if you ask me    I liked the guy characters because they all had their set personality making it fresh when you go to a different route. And many of the stories were very interesting to go into. I don't want to go into too much detail so this will be spoiler free.  Shin-&gt; He is such a tsun tsun but a sweetie ^ u ^ Oh and suprisingly the smartest guy out of the bunch in the end. I guess seemed a bit more realistic to me than the other boys.  Toma-&gt; I personally really liked his character, he's definietly not for everyone. I just liked he was really out there compared to the other characters.    Though I think the Heroine shouldn't have been all okay after what he did to her @ m @     Kent-&gt; He starts off a total meanie-poo but like Shin he really isn't that bad. He goes off onto a lot of tangents of things like math and what not. But he was an amusing character.  Ikki-&gt; The 'playboy' or 'pretty boy' character but reading his story, there is so much more to him than on the surface.  Ukyo-&gt; Prepare for the feels! His story is so bittersweet. You can't help but like this guy T w T  Based on the characters themselves and how much I liked them:  Toma&gt;Ukyo&gt;Shin&gt;Kent&gt;Ikki    Based on stories I found the most interesting are in the order:   Ukyo&gt;Shin&gt;Toma&gt;Ikki&gt;Kent . Ikki and Kent's story didn't interest me as much, I guess they just felt, I guess more like slice-of-life, while the others seemed to be a bit crazier with their stories, drawing me in more. (However, this is just a personal preference)  Story itself: I found it a quite interesting premise, though I wish you could voice up more, Orion ends up taking the brunt of everything, which kind of ruins the effect for me. But    unraveling the mystery in some character's stories for why you have Amnesia were actually quite interesting, some were very dumb though...)     Voices: The characters' voice acting is very good @ w @ I really enjoyed them. I especially liked Shins. Haha. But I think they all fit the characters very well.  ~Overall. I really enjoyed the story and the characters in it. It was an enjoyable experience overall and would recommened to anyone who likes visual novels and an interesting set of characters.",

Not only does the character not talk 70% of the game on her own, but a spirit acts as her best friend who speaks the thoughts of the player (at least he thought what I did). This game isn't just about a girl with amnesia, the plot has twists upon twists. If you're one to not enjoy horror, it serves a purpose. It's not to scare you, but emphasize the love of a tortured character in the game. The art is breathtaking, the translation is greatly appreciated, the male voices are completely present throughout the game (including after choosing a response!), and the voice actors were practically destined to play their roles. There is more to the game than it leads on to. Mystery will always be prevelant until the very last world. 35 hours of gaming was completely worth $30. If I had to pick one visual novel game on steam, this would be the one to outshine the others.",

The characters are gorgeous. Translations are really well done, and each route focuses on your relationship with your guy. It doesn't give you a pointless plot that your relationship develops alongside, but provides you with their struggles and how your relationship is critical to their development. It is very apparent that all the characters care deeply for the MC, which is usually not the premise that otome games begin with. Usually relationships develop overtime, which can be pretty tedious, but here you get all these cute and loving gestures at the outset (some less apparent than others). In summary, I would totally recommend this game. It is definitely a much more worthwhile purchase than other otome games in english out there!",

It's one of those Otome games where you have to play over and over to achieve every ending. I personally think the endings with the tiniest change in detail shouldn't be regarded as actual 'endings', it was incredibly boring having to skip over the long dialogue just to get something so menial.  Despite its shortcomings, still worth a good look for game for fans of the genre.
