Experience what it's like to be a pioneer in the guilded age and see what life could be for anyone living back then. Shoot bandits, hunt for treasure, and build a town bigger than any form of life has ever seen!  Follow the tale of a brother and sister as they try and find their father who's gone missing. Their father being a railroad owner, they have also been raised in the custom of running a railroad and therefore seek his whereabouts. Come across numerous towns, small and large, meet people from all over of different skills and talents, and venture out in the wild west to see what truly is meant for you!    Thanks for reading!
