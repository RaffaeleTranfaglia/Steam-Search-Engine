It took forever to even join a game and when I did there were two players for a 10 player map.  The game idea is great but its just not worth it if you expect this to be a large community.  Also after buying the game I only got 1 hour of actually play time before I had to pay agian so because of this its a negative review.   Just don't buy this game. ",

            "review_text": "It seems like a really nice game and I would gladly recommend it, but the thing is there is 0 players on the servers. And when I say 0 I mean NOBODY! Really dissapointing, the developers should make it known that no one plays the game and at least make a singleplayer campaign or just remove the game from steam. It has potential but at the moments it's useless. I hope that changes in the near future because it seems like I've spent 8.99â‚¬ for a multiplayer game with no players.  ",
