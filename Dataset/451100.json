            "review_text": "i bought CubiKolor today. I had the chance to play the game during a french festival and it was very fun. After playing a couple of hours, I can say I had the same fun. It's very rewarding to play and pass over the tests.  Frustrating, but not enough to be boring, colourful and a very zen music, I had a doubt on that detail but I have to admit the music is a good point, and help to focus.  Be sure to be a great fan of puzzle games, this one is really good, but like all puzzle games, you have to be prepared, it will be a great challenge...and I love that!",
