            "review_text": "ok people lets be real here , you can’t spend 3.99$ on a game and expecting it to be as good as battlefield I mean you get exactly what you paid for a simple and short indie rail-shooter game. -the plot : I can resume the plot to this , you're an US soldier in a mission to invade Iran cause they have nuclear plans lol and the game make it like you're the hero who is risking his life and killing Iranian people because they are bad guys ( army propaganda ) the thing is if you invade a country you have to expect that those people of this country will fight back and defend their lands ,you can’t just walk in and do what you like in the name of freedom and the ending was so dumb and cheesy that makes you laugh , invade a foreign country and kill their people in the name of freedom and then call them terrorist cause they resisted and fought back to protect what they have ?!!! Seriously?!!! A soldier of a fighter is called a hero when he protects his country not invade others. -the gameplay: same as any other rail-shooter game mechanics, mouse to aim,shoot,reload and throw grenades , WSDA to take cover and there is also QTE ,their some lvls use tank , you got also army point to lvl up and get new weapons and more ammo, in this type of games you just need to be fast in aiming and shooting . -the graphics: blow average but still have some good effects. -sound :the voice acting is so corny and cheesy that makes me laugh each time he narrate missions plot, the plot isn’t the strongest point of this game and the voice acting didn’t help much lol + the enemies have the same screaming with the same voice, and what’s with the sound volume ?!!! You can’t hear almost anything. -didn’t have any problems with the game, no bugs or glitches expect the sound volume  - Multiplayer: CO-OP - Easy achievements and steam trading cards If you can’t stand army propaganda and ignore the plot then this isn’t the game for you, as for me I enjoyed it and had some fun (didn’t take the game seriously that's why i rate it positive) but grab it on sale cause the game is really short (1 to 1:30h to complete) 5/10",

            "review_text": "My time on this game is skewed due to leaving it open for the cards and forgetting that the launcher counts as 'time played.'   With that said, this game is pretty poor. It is similar in quality to the Rambo on-rails shooter video game that came out some time ago. Dialogue is clunky, the story isn't engaging, aiming and the 'feel' of the guns is off. It probably doesn't help that I played a much better on-rails shooter (Blue Estate), but this game is a harsh step backwards.  The only saving gracy(?) is that it is cheap.",
