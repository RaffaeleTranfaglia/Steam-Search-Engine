            "review_text": "A fun little 'puzzle' platformer. Be warned, some of the puzzles are just praying to RNJesus and then the 'jump puzzles' are sheer dumb luck in some places as no shadows and even the slightest mistouch and you slide off to your doom. Also, there is a level where you have to jump across moving platforms to an archer. He can shoot you as you are landing and have it slide you off the platform thus taking 2 out of your 3 hearts in damage (there is fall damage if high enough). If you don't mind restarting levels because of varying bugs occassionally screwing things up and can see past those then you can enjoy this game. Graphics are ok, music is nice, and the whole mario kill effect can be fun as well as the enemies friendly fire.  Update: devs quickly fixed the big issue that I marked as a no so it's now a yes.",
