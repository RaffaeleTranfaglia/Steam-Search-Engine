            "review_text": "This review will be incredibly short as there is not much to say about this incredibly short title. So lets get this show on the road.  I'm not really sure what the game is about. You play as this little squid who hatches from an egg and makes his way up on top of a tree.  The game is a point and click game, but you don't move the character. The character moves on his own and you just clear the path so he can continue this journey.  The art style is incredible. It's this games best feature. It's fun to just to look around at the environment.  The game is also incredibly short clocking in at around 15 minutes long, so when you finish it don't expect a second playthrough.  Overall this game is a fun short experience. If you're looking for something while you're bored give this game a shot.  Final Rating: 7/10 - Play It  If you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on what you disliked about the review.

            "review_text": "hmmm....I'm not totally sure what this game was really about, but it was a pleasant and short experience. An alien is born (hatched) and makes his/her/its way through a series of rooms and tunnels, sometimes with the help of a bee (or was it a fly?) on it's way to.....who knows. That isnt disclosed, lol.   Anyway, the puzzles werent challenging, but they were clever nonetheless. The graphics were polished and looked nice, and the representation of the apple/octopus hybrid looking alien was kind of cool. Why there were flies/bees (?), a microscopic robot, and a full sized squirrel/chipmunk/something similar, is beyond me. The reason for the elvators, bike pump and so on were equally mysterious. Nonetheless, it was what I would call a quaint experience. The final moment of the game was also quite nice.  All in all, for a ten minute free game, you probably wont find a better looking game with as good a puzzle mechanic.  I liked it well enough even if I have no idea why it exists or what purpose it truly serves, lol.  8/10",

The simple yet fascinating puzzles represent real life struggles and challenges that are often difficult in the present but simple in retrospect.  The journey through the phases of life are captured and blended seamlessly through background cues. Recurring themes such as the elevator are likely symbolic of similar real world themes with staying power. Often times the puzzles result in the destruction of environment in order to progress, akin to the difficult choices we often must make- opportunity cost is not free. But this game is.",

You solve some puzzles to help a little blop advance through the story, by clicking on items that are subtlely highlighted through the rather nice scenery.  The art is very stylish, the music is very soothing, and the game is a little slower-paced. All in all, for what it is, it isn't bad, though admittedly, I think I'd need someone to explain the meaning behind it. It's a bit lost on me.  It's worth a shot, in my opinion. It's free, so the only thing you have to lose is roughly fifteen minutes of your time.  (I'd also reccomend Windowsill, Machinarium, or Samorost2 [Samorost1 is free and browser-based] if you're interested in another game similar to this one. They cost money, but are good if you're into this sort of thing.)",

While the puzzles are fairly simple, they still amaze me by how creative they are and how much fun they were to solve. Even with the dark ambience, the game is some what adorable, and just makes you want to hug the little creature trying to escape the tree.   I did love this game, but I was disappointed by the fact of how short the game is. The game is only 18 minutes long (It was for me anyway), and by the art and creativness, I think this game has true potential! This game should be longer, it dosen't have to be a super long game, but atleast long enough to keep players satisfied.  I digress. Even with the short play time, I think this game was well made. I recommend this game to the fullest, and I hope this reveiw helps in your decision on wheather or not you want to install this game.",

This game deflty covers everything from the concept of cloud seeding by the government to suffrage rights for women in an oppressive world. There's even hints of fear mongering and it raises really interesting questions about quantum physics and its role in your relationship with your parents. You could easily burn a good 5-6 hours on this game, probably more if you want to really dig into the issues it raises. I also found if I recorded the background music and played it backwards at half speed, I could hear the (pretty obvious) voice of Margret Thatcher telling me it was time to get in touch with my inner sexy horse whisperer.

            "review_text": "Review For The Old Tree  You may see that I've only played this game for 30 minutes... that's how long the game is. You may be thinking, wow, a half hour game, how dumb. You sir, are wrong.  Alright, so you may or may not be this alien, you are definitely following it. There is no story, no background story at least, you are just this alien that is trying to get back to space. Now, what do you do? Control the alien? Nope. You are controlling the environment around him or her, which is surprising cool.   The graphics don't need to be good, but they are, well at least the environment is, especially in the cave areas. Basically, the alien moves to a certain point and you have to try to find a way to get him/her to progress the level. It is a puzzle game, but it's a point and click puzzle game. Some of the puzzles are really simple, leading to a 3 second progression time and others had me for as long as about 10 minutes (the water one especially) and the puzzle difficulty are the right level, which is the best. It's a free-to-play game, so you can't beat that and it takes about 1 minute to install, this game is fun. No music however, but sound effects which makes the game a lot more mysterious.   You don't grow any bond on the alien but you do feel bad for him, you have that part where you're despirately wishing that he will find a way home. 30 minutes worth of gameplay is enough for this game, no story and just a ton of puzzles for maybe an hour more would be a little boring. No multiplayer neither a title screen, if there was one complaint I had about the game was that there are no options or title screen, that would have been nice to mess around with. There's no title for the game when you are playing either however, an Adobe 11 message is what fills your screen.  For a free-to-play, 30 minute, puzzle game (no spoilers) but a quick but enjoyable ending, point and click, no music but errie feel, alien loving, bee crushing, soup making, water cranking, bee-water-carrying, this game will give you nothing less than a fun and good time, is it replayability worth? Yup, I do have to say.  Who else thought the alien had a green apple as his head at the beginning? -Detroit0127",

The Old Tree is a short game that takes very little time to complete, however, it inspires many different feelings throughout the course of the game.  Gameplay: My playthrough took about 20 minutes, which I have noticed is about the average for most people. The moves encompassed the 'w,s,a,d' buttons (really, mostly just the 'a and d' buttons) and your mouse. For this game, those movements worked perfectly to get you from point A to point B.   Graphics: The developers have done a very good job keeping your focus on the alien-baby you are controlling, with darker undertones for the background. This accentuates the vivid coloring of your character. I thought the graphics were well done with a sort of 'drawn on' effect.  Audio: The music for this game is phenomenal! The melodies of course changed with different scenes, but did not take away from the experience in anyway. Instead, the music only enhanced the action! The songs themselves did more for the general ambience of the game then everything else (gameplay/graphics).  Storyline: This game has a very basic storyline that is really easy to follow. It seemed to me as though is was kind of a twist to the point and click genre. Your alien-baby is on rails throughout the game, and you only move ahead once you can sort out the puzzle. The puzzles are simplistic for the most part and do not take a lot of time to get through, so the overall flow of the game is not broken up.  There are so many ways to experience this game, and I think most people will have varying opinions on what it all is supposed to mean. To me, it started out symbolizing fear. Fear of the unknown, and what was to come for such a tiny creature. It then moved into more of a feeling of triumph, and the knowledge that one can do anything, as long as the will and the effort are there. With a game that takes under half an hour to complete, the playthrough is still a very pleasant occasion. Overall, I believe that this game is completely worth it, and I would highly recommend it, especially because it is offered for free.",
