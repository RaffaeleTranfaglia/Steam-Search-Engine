            "review_text": "  I absolutely LOVE this game. It plays just like the fighting games I played in the arcade as a kid and art style seems to be inspired by Tim Burton, so it's basically a double nostalgia bomb.  Each character is absolutely adorable and unique, with their own super moves and world animations. The campaign portion of FrightShow Fighter is just difficult enough to provide a challenge for seasoned gamers, but not so hard that a newbie to the genre would have a hard time completeing it. The multiplayer is also a lot of fun and comes with the ability to select special buffs/powers (once unlocked in the campaign) to even further your play experience.   I can't say enough good things about it. I definitely recommend it for anyone whose a fan of cute and creepy stuff, fighting games, and destroying their friends with the power of kitties (you didn't read that wrong)!!",
