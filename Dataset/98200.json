A notable feature that's standing out is the fact that the strategy turn-by-turn factor is in fact taking place simultaneously. In other words, you don't react to someone's turn, you guess what will the do next. This changes the whole mechanic of turn-by-turn strategy games, offering something new, fresh that guarantees an enjoyable, fun and rewarding experience throught. Oh, and the music is a nice techno styled, matrix kind of thingy.",

            "review_text": "Have you ever wanted to play a game where your tactical thinking was rewarded without having too much hassle or any difficult mechanics to grasp? Yes? Then this is the game for you.  Frozen Synapse is an absolute wonderful tactical battlefield commander game. You are able to control several of your soldiers on a randomly generated map against either a human or AI player and lead them, showing whether they should duck or stand up, engage or continue on sight, time their actions, etc., all in hopes to out-think your opponent and guess what they will do. You are given planning phases which, although they may be lengthy, give you the chance to test every possible scenerio to your liking, giving you the ultimate think session of your life every turn.  Frozen Synapse also has great co-op in it's expansion pack, which gives you the same tactical fun with a friend. I highly recommend you get it - it's called Red Mode, or something like that. Another great feature this game has is the ability to play multiple games at a time. You get popup invites from other people, which you can either accept or deny, into their games, which allows you to play however many games you want to play over any period of time you like, which leads to the bad parts about this game.  I'm not going to lie, this game isn't perfect. There's no punishing system for abandoning games, which happens a little too often with bad mannered players who don't want to finish a losing game. Not only that, but It does have two or more glitches (you can plan to move your soldier through a wall, but the game says that you can't do that, and an extra move when trying to walk beside a wall, really nothing that major or game-breaking) which can annoy you a little, but it won't consistantly happen to you.   My final verdict for Frozen Synapse is this - if you are a fan of thinking games, especially chess, GET THIS GAME IMMEDIATELY. If you are not, wait for a sale, because you very well might enjoy this game for it's easy-to-understand, but hard-to-master mechanics. A solid NINE out of TEN from me on this wonderful game.",

I highly recommend this game to anyone that loves tactics and strategic games, this includes games like chess. The number of unique moves in this game by far outnumbers the moves possible in chess. There is no way two matches in this game is ever going to look the same, you need to consider your every little move you do.  Combined with a very nice soundtrack that almost perfectly sets the mood of the game i simply say this:  This is one of the best indie games ever made, buy it!.",

While their weapons differ, their move sets remain largely the same.  In turn based fashion, each round is spent instructing individual units where, when, and how to move, aim, and shoot. Only by tactically queuing up their actions is victory achievable. This complex but rewarding gameplay mechanic will likely drive casual players away.  Once instructions are given, the player enters the 'Prime' phase where his and his opponent's squads execute their given tasks.  Mode7's masterpiece is unlike anything I've ever played.

This game can be played online and offline, against the AI in skirmish mode or in a campaign as well as against other players from around the world. It can be nailbiting while you watch the outcome and realize all your awesome and unbeatable planning goes down the toilet as your opponent does exactly what you didn't think of. And on the other hand, the feeling is great when you watch your plan unfold and you stomp the opponent into the ground. But the best thing is, if things go awry and you lose, you always know it had nothing to do with luck but all with the mistakes you did. It is a bit like chess where you have to plan your moves into the future and adapt to the strategies of your opponent.   The units you (can) use range from machinegunners, to shotguns, rocket launcher and grenades to snipers and riot shilds. There are also differnt types of scenarios such as rescue hostages, secure a specific area or just plain extermination to name only a few.   The most important thing about this game is that you cannot just rush in and shoot blindly. You have to use a tactical approach and plan your moves carefully. Your units don't have many hitpoints as in classical shooters. One hit and they are dead biomass. Buildings and covers can be destroyed by rockets. So depending on the units there might be not a save spot to just sit and wait.   Another nice aspect of this game is, that you don't need to be permanently online. You can plan your moves offline. And soon as the turn result is there, you get notified of it and can prepare the next turn. So even for casual players who don't have much time, this is a good game to spend a few minutes for your turn and upload it.   I really hope this game gets more attention as it surly deserves it. The grafics in Tron style and the nice soundtrack are really catchy. Very nice is also, that when you buy a game, you also get a second one to send to a friend.   So would i recommend the game?

The story became gripping and the characters very interesting. It's a mix of corporate espionage, rebellion, and a war of beliefs coming together to make a fantastic singleplayer.  On the multiplayer side, it comes with the added benefit of being asynchronous (after you setup your strategy, you can wander off for hours while your opponent decides; kind of like chess by mail). The game modes are neat and varied and seting up a match is pretty easy. Another plus, the people I played against were gratious and felt like a great community.

Oh nvm, back to the recommendation. I'll try to keep it as short as possible. Well where to start? Imagine a virtual chess mixed with Rainbow Six. It's a 1 vs 1 skirmish most of the time, but the are other modes too. Every player is assigned different units with different strenghts and weaknesses, the map is randomized and can be played with fog of war or without. The game is very easy to learn, the interface does a great job, you can crouch, aim + walk, run without trying to engage, engage as soon as you see someone, ignore a specific enemy or just hide behind a window, all with simple commands/clicks. Nevertheless, it's a bit harder to master, to create good strategies and beat your opponent in a battle of warfare wits. There are no random numbers, no evasion or dice involved, everything is calculated perfectly (this is because these are not human soldiers, they are different entities explained by the story), even if it the graphics show you that the soldier is shooting randomly and seems to hit with only one of the random bullets, in reality, that's just a visual effect, there are specific rules when the 'killshot' is issued. Multiplayer is very nice, with friends or strangers, you can play your game like you would normally do, everyone doing their turn, or you can log out, your friend can do his turn, send it to server, and then you can continue the game when he's offline, for example. This allows you to play even two or more games simultaneously, jumping from one to another. Last thing is, the electric music is very soothing. If you like brewing strategies with a little group of soldiers, this is for you, don't miss it, you can even invite me to a game ^_^ .",

Ordered your men to walk up behind an enemy and blast him? Too bad, your enemy ordered that guy to turn around moments before you arrive.  It's pure tactics with no chance or twitch gaming in the way. Each battle is mathmatically solvable (To the point that you can simulate fights before you commit to your moves), there's no element of random here.

The turn based combat thing is a thing I am generally fond of, and I will also admit to being a old hand at Warcraft 2, though I never spent a lot of time on the third. The gameplay here is a unique take combining both types of games, breaking down combat into five second turns and processing each user’s movements simultaneously between turns.   The control scheme in order to facilitate this sort of control, movement, and aiming for multiple pieces on the ‘board’, can get a little complex, but the tutorial does a decent job of giving you a solid overview of the play controls, and the fact that each turn can be looped and played while you are setting it up and moving around all your little pieces means you have plenty of time to fiddle around with the specifics for each of your characters, though I feel like more than an hour of messing around with the specific aiming direction of four little blue pawns would start to grate on my nerves, satisfying bullet-flying notwithstanding.  Storywise I don’t foresee anything unique happening based on my opening sample. Essentially, the story you get early on in the game is that you are a computer program designed to maneuver other computer programs to take out other computer programs that may or may not be real people. It seems like it would be enough to keep you engaged between loading screens, but then again, I didn’t play Starcraft for the storylines either, I played it to zerg rush Terrans until they were forced to pick up all their buildings and fly away into a corner.  All in all, I feel like this game would be good if you are the sort of person who plays RTS games where you pause every few moments to get your bearings, or feel like chess or checkers isn’t fluid enough for you. Good for a way to waste some strategy gaming time if you have it.  Game’s fate: Uninstalled. Though I enjoy RTS/turn based combat games, and this one is certainly a take I haven’t seen before, I’ll pass on keeping this around for now.  Buy/No Buy: At full price, I can’t see putting that kind of investment into it, though if it was on sale, I would certainly buy again, and I know this one goes on sale quite often, so wishlist it if you’re interested.

            "review_text": "You know what makes chess the ultimate strategy game that has lasted for thousands of years? Its simplicity.   Frozen Synapse takes the turn-based strategy game genre to an extreme level of meticulousness. This is saying something in a genre that already resembles something like chess with more rules.  I am a long-time fan of turn-based strategy games, with the X-Com iterations holding a special place in my heart (well just the first two and the remake actually), so I am no stranger to intricate control over characters and exhaustive planning for each turn. However, there are two questions that must be answered in the affirmative for any TBS game to be considered 'good': First, are the controls efficient? Second, is the game fun?  Unfortunately, Frozen Synapse fails on both accounts. The painstaking level of control over every minute movement of your troops is maddening and superfluous. You are the most anal-retentive military commander in all of history, and while the game provides a reasonable explanation for it, your troops are apparently mindless drones. Simply adding more controls over every little movement does not make a TBS game superior to others. Extraneous controls weaken a strategy game's enjoyability by obstructing its very purpose: strategy. Very often, you will find yourself losing rounds/games because you forgot to set a drone to look in a specific direction or to duck at the right moment, or walk quickly/slowly. Not because you didn't realize that those moves were necessary, no, because you FORGOT. There are so many options to set for each individual unit, that you can easily spend an hour just setting up a SINGLE TURN. I am not exaggerating, the multiplayer gives opponents a week to post their turn! This kind of burdening complexity removes the players ability to strategize and gives advantage to the player who is most able to memorize details. Strategy is about out-thinking your opponent's moves and countering them, or recovering from a weaker position with superior tactics, NOT micro-managing the user-interface.  So is it fun? Well, Frozen Synapse insists on you monitoring every sniffle and cough your troops make, so the majority of the time playing this game is spent staring at a screen of unmoving drones and identical walls, running simulation after simulation to determine the highest likely method of success. It would be just as fun to compare tax audits to determine which IRS agent was the most efficient!   Speaking of identical walls, the graphical quality of this game is terrible. I have never before claimed to need high quality graphics in a game, in fact in many ways the fight for ever greater graphics is ruining the industry, but if ever there was a game that needed better graphical design: this is it. The neon colors that honestly looked cool in the trailers and screencaps are horrendous to look at after only ten hours or so of gameplay. Every character looks the same, every wall is identical, you are a robot commander of a robot army killing other robots for no reason whatsoever.   Some of the positive reviews said the game was 'easy to get into, but hard to master,' and this is an outright lie. This game is hard to get into and hard to master. I will say it again: strategy games require simple controls so the only thing between you and victory is your tactics. Not fun.",

            "review_text": "I wanted to like this game. I bought the DLC for this game. The concept for this game is great and the writing is trash but I don't care. I made several false starts at learning this game, and I'm pretty sure I finally did, but the single player has an escort mission that involves an unrealistically bad area defense against way too many opponents, and it's like the third mission. It involves specialized units, which kill the game. Shotguns can't engage anything beyond about 20 feet even if you order them to. They don't miss, they just don't fire. At the same time, an enemy shotgun on the run will beat a readied assault rifle at close range, which basically means that by the rules I can't defend with the units the scenario gave me. There are no difficulty levels to adjust this.  BUY the soundtrack and not this game. You probably got it as part of a humble bundle, which is maybe what it deserved.  UPDATE: This game is addictive, though. While I was writing the review, I thought, oh, but what if I move my shotguns into base to fight the enemy shotguns and use my rifle to cover my flank? That shouldn't work, because of how far away they start my shotgun unit, but it's worth trying! And it turns out that no, an unready AI shotgun beats an already-aimed player shotgun.",

Friend had the option (and other options that I didn't, still don't know why) but when tried it gave the error 'You must have the expansion activated on the server to use this option.'  On top of that: * Tutorial was painful and at times insulting. They were going for sarcastic AI insulting the player for being bad at the game but the humor really didn't play that well. * They made me create an account specifically for the game. I don't want any more logins or accounts, please just let me authenticate through Steam. * VS mode was extremely unbalanced. Would start frequently one player is a very disadvantageous position.

The tutorial doesn't do a great job of familiarizing the player with all of the game's features, which I think takes away from the long term success of this title as a multiplayer game. After spending so much time working out the perfect plan to own your adversary and watching it play out in a matter of seconds then seeing that plan fall apart before those seconds are even over I didn't have much motivation to experiment.  The multiplayer part of the game can be played somewhat at your leisure by opting to receive e-mail notifications when the enemy has taken their turn, but it's far from an exciting game that will keep you engaged.
