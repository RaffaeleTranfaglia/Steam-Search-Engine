This will be the first thing i'll showcase to anyone what VR is capable of, how VR can make you feel and how it really shines above ALL multimedia experience a person can get. This gave me goosebumps, my mouth fell open about 5 times, and even though it doesnt use any of the vive features (no movement, no controllers), it is the best feeling I ever got in VR.  Props for the creatures of this art, not much more to say but thanks for making this diamond.",

Just when you think the experience is going to stay calm and possibly get boring, it absolutely does not - it keeps you engaged and dazzled with imagery! I also really like the whole travelling thing. It really kept reminding me of Disney World's Pirates of the Carribean ride. It's so fantastic that now instead of paying an arm and a leg only to wait in line for hours at an amusement park, developers can give us even more exciting experiences right in our home VR room - WELL DONE, DEV!!!!",

            "review_text": "This isn't a GAME so much as an incredibly well-done VR music video. While the opera music IS cool, the real reason I found this VR title noteworthy is because every HTC Vive title I've played so far I've found SEVERELY underwhelming in terms of making use of their graphics capabilities. This totally lives up to expectations.     Everyone else in my household who has been playing VR titles has been like 'aw man wow it's like you're actually there' -- and while I do find VR immersive, I don't find it as believable as they do currently-- or jump at scary VR things-- or... any of that. You would THINK it would be the opposite because I have some mental illness issues with occasional psychosis and all-- I guess the alternate realities I 'hallucinate' are just much more real-looking than the typical VR stuff and so it all looks fake to me...     ANYWAY-- point is, they made amazing use of graphics-- which should be easy considering it's largely a completely computer generated video for a VR music video-- but they really deliver. There were some parts that felt a little too real to me. Haha. It was very enjoyable. I can't wait until games look this good.",
