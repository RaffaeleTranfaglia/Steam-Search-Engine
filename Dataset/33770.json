I really like the controls for movement, you can point and click or take full control, very similar to World of Warcraft. In battles you can pause (turnbase style) or just go full action. I am also a fan of The Dark Eye ruleset, if you hover over or right click on anything it gives an explaination, so it is easy to learn. There is alot crafting and upgrades, tons of collectable items and weapons, and you cant go 10 feet without a chest or barrell full of stuff. Add mine to the list of positive reviews.",

            "review_text": "Sequel to the fun, but not all that great RPG Drakensang.  Unlike the first game, this one is actually good all around. They seem to have figured out what went wrong with their first foray in to RPG territory, and fixed it right up. The combat has been improved, although its still basic PnP rules, the story is actually interesting, and stays consistent, unlike the first one, and its just much better constructed.  If you like RPGs, and want one very similar to the oldschool PnP style games, ( NWN/NWN2, KotOR/2 ), then you'd be foolish to not pick up River of Time at its asking price, its everything I was hoping Dragon Age 2 would be, except much cheaper.",

You goddam better, they always have better storylines than your cliche young angsty hero with spiky hair saves the world that have cursed JRPGS. This game sticks you an a group of adventurers on a quest to recover a crown stolen by a legendary theif. You fight tons of different enemies and the character sheet lets you make any type of hero you choose. This game is also beautiful, i have some screenshots of really neat scenery and fights.",
