Everything seemed fine for lets say 10 minutes. But, and thats a very big one, it has nearly no choice and nothing seems to have an effect on what i can do. It looks like just option 1 for girl A and option 2 for girl 2! And you end with the girl. And not just end it, it really ends with the first and last, lets say private moment. Thats so fast i couldnt even tell it happend.  I accept that there are stereotypes and other mishaps, but this seems so off and without thought. No character design, just the next unfinished 'game' from  ajtilley.com . Just to push more kickstarter projects (or more multiple money collections for one game, to, ehm, make it 'better') and to start more games. Because, yeah, why should you finish a game if you just tell your customers there are episodes or a 'new' game waiting for them.   This is not a game, nor an episode. It's pure scam. (and again, i didn't wanted to write this, but after this mail from the author i had to write!)",

            "review_text": "There’s a reason why I cannot recommend Beach Bounce. I know this was meant to be a fan service game, with girls all over the MC. But honestly, the full price is just  insanely expensive  for such a short and rushed VN. I haven’t played the “original version” (like I read on other reviews), but I know that this current version ain’t good. Art style is decent/good, backgrounds were nicely done… But the background songs sometimes don’t match the events during the game (like an overly happy song playing during on what was supposed to be a sad scene), same with the character’s facial expressions and the text. It might be a minor thing… But it bothers me.  4/10. Oh, another thing that bothered me was that the MC’s sprite was like a shadow… But you can see his face clearly on CG’s (  especially the one where Mineko kisses him  ). So why make him like a shadow if his actual appearance has already been decided? ._.  Well, if you get this game on a bundle, it’s fine. Like I said, there’s no deep story or major mysteries here, it’s fan service. But paying the full price really isn’t worth… Not even on a good sale (unless it's a -90%)...",

To hear that part three wasn't coming was a dissapointment. The remastered version? I tried it, since it didn't cost anything. Thought I'd see if it held it's charm. But really didn't. Really, REALLY didn't. The characters have become dull and unimaginative. The story is dull and bland. And there's more depth to a thin-based pizza than this version of the game. Overall? If you're thinking of getting this, don't. If you can find a way to play the original, do - it's amazing, even incomplete. But this... no. Just, no.",

            "review_text": "SPOILER-FREE Enjoyable VN game. I recommend it to newtime VN players and to veterans who want something shorter before they play their next 40 hr one. I'll say this first; this game is relatively short. After completing 100%, my steam time says I've played 120 minutes, though I did use the skip feature to miss previously read text. The game also doesn't have voice, being made in Ren'py. However, the game is very well made, and the art is really nice, although all static images.  There are plenty of branch options leading to the different endings, which help to make you feel like you're Tomo (the protaganist) aiding in your immersion. The choices generally feel like they are doing something worthwhile; only a couple feel like they're there for the sake of it. There are seven girls to choose from. Each of the characters is interesting, and their personalities are fun, although Nymph could have been fleshed out a little better, though arguably she is only a side character, and a little more history for Minami wouldn't have hurt.  I really recommend this game; it was enjoyable, made me chuckle a few times, and despite the girls having Japanese names, the game doesn't have a tonne of Japanisms, so is accessible to those who aren't as familiar with Japanese culture; this means I can recommend it to all VN players, old and new to the scene alike.  If you are of age, I highly recommend the uncensor patch available at the developer's website; although the game is fine without the adult scenes, its more enjoyable with them. Apart from a little bit of 'messiness', they're quite tastefully done, and help to make the characters feel more rounded.  Pros: -Nice story. -Fun characters. (Seven girls to choose from) -Good art, the CGs are nice to look at. -Nice range of branch options. -Doesn't require understanding of Japanese culture, so beginner friendly. -Some humour, enough to cause a chuckle, but without using typical tropes. -(With uncensor patch) Tasteful art, nothing over the top, helps to make you care about the characters more. -Only 120-180 minutes to completion. (Both a pro and con - you decide)  Cons: -Static images. (no Nekopara-style character movement) -No voice-acting. -Nymph could be a better character with more to her. (but doesn't feel like a main heroine so not too big a deal) -Only 120-180 minutes to completion. (Both a pro and con - you decide)",

            "review_text": "Yandere Eyes.  I've played both Summer Fling and Club Life, but compared to those two, Beach Bounce is drastically different. Since I didn't play the original Beach Bounce, I'm not really sure how different it is from the remastered version.   Though I have to say I don't understand why this isn't doing better than the other two, except for a few trivial nitpicks I've had with this game. Beach Bounce is about a dropout looking over a resort, while his grandmother is in the hospital.   Since his co-workers are all female, it was pretty easy to figure out he was going to end up with at least one of them, and this is where the differences between Dharker Studios other works, like. I actually thought the art here was better in this game, and didn't quite fall under same face syndrome, like the other two. Same goes for the writing during sex scenes.  It didn't drag on too much, probably because it had a better flow of dialogue and description, which really reminded me of successful games like Sunrider Academy. The only disappointing thing I found about the game, is that the CG gallery slots were taken up by character stills that weren't sex, and that some of the epilogue endings either didn't have art to them, or were barely given a conclusion. Still, doesn't stop me from liking it better than the other two games.  Really can't emphasize enough that this one had more dialogue padding, before we actually got to a sex scene, but not horribly long. Also, Rei won me over with how accepting she was, after misunderstandings were cleared up.",
