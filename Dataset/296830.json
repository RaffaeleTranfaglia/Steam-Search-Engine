The Book of Revelation predicts the birth of a child that would end up ruling the world with an iron rod. The first part of this prophecy has been fulfilled. It is time to take care of the rest.",

            "review_text": "A rather disappointing sequel.  The original was all about story and atmosphere. While every chapter had a gruesome murder at the end, that was only after you had a chance to learn more about the manor, its inhabitants and their secrets.  If the first game was an adventure game, Lucius II is a murder sandbox. So while you have more freedom about using your powers to kill in many different ways, all feel very empty and meaningless.  Like in many horror movie sequels, it's easy to just increase the body count, but the atmosphere of the original was lost in the process. ",

The sequel is built far more open than in the first game. Gives you the freedom to roam around and encourages you to be creative and plan deaths for absolutely everyone, in the most brutal ways ever! That's defintely a huge improvement. The story and gameplay start slow and lame in the begining, find keys, unlock door, find more keys, unlock more doors. But as I progressed more, it started to make sense. The devil has two sons and they compete to sit on the Dark throne. Also Satan is gay, couldn't ask for a better story! But I was able to ignore its flaws eventually and now I like it a lot.",

            "review_text": "The main reason why I'm recommending the game is not because I adored the first, but because it has quite a lot of promise despite it's flaws. The plot of the story is just as basic as the first, but tries to over complicate itself with themes and character development that is lackluster and could have been slowed down for a more meaningful experience. Some moments, like when you first physically meet with Lucifer and when you meet up with your demon brother Isaac, leaves much to be desired. The story is rushed and feels as if, despite the gameplay and world being much more thought out, the story was put on the backburner and not given as much attention as it deserved. The story had very redeeming qualities that if it was given more time and effort, it would have been a lot more exciting. I really loved the idea of Lucifers sons fighting to be the favourite and doing so through a biblical demonic event. It moves past the personal struggles with his biological family and makes his demonic one more dynamic and almost human. For the gameplay, I felt that the fast paced and almost rushed qualities of the story rubbed off on it. The skills you obtain and the different ways that you can execute your targets were plentiful. You didn't have individual targets like the first game though, but whole floors full of people with you having a choice whether to only kill those you need to kill, or to kill them all to get more power. This is great, but the first games targets felt a lot more personal and gave you a chance to have an attachment to the character if you so wished to. If there would be a better balance between each aspect of the game and slowed it down, I think it would be much more successful of a game. Also, in regards to the endings hint towards a Lucius 3, it was a good ending at best and would have benefited with a little more flare. Perhaps using that tutorial map more so Lucifer could have more of a spotlight like he had in the first game would have done the trick. In my opinion I'd give the game a solid 6/10.",

The idea for this game's cool, it just didn't come out properly. Also, I don't know what they used to record some of the voice actors, (a potato maybe?) but it's TERRIBLE quailty. You're better off just playing the first one, and pretending this one doesn't exist.",

The gameplay is completely different, and although it could have been a nice change, it seems like it's only in alpha stage and is pretty horrible to play in comparison to the first game. All of the characters have no logic to them. Don't worry if you get caught killing someone or if someone finds a dead body, there are virtually no consequences as they will carry on acting as if nothing happened. You can't even use your hands anymore, everything is done via levitating objects. If there is a cross in the room, you can't just go and turn it over. No, you have to stand far away from it and throw an object at it with your telekynesis.   Remember all those awesome elements that made you love the first game? You're not really going to find those here (no more challenging puzzles). The storyline isn't implemented into the game very well either. There are multiple bugs in the game too, but none of them are really game breaking.  Overall, this game looks like it's in alpha stage, not even beta. It's pretty aweful to play compared to the first game and could have been an amazing sequel. I might still try and complete the game for the story's sake, but I don't know if I can cope with the bugs and the gameplay.  Seeing as it only costs a few bucks now I would say just buy it and see for yourself if you like it, but I honestly wouldn't pay any more than that.",

It's pretty much a Murder Simulator and it is stup[idly funny watching the NPCs get electrocuted or blown up with gas tanks etc. However there are a few issues, namely the controls and how people interact with doors. Controls - Horrendous at times, stupidly hard to focus on the correct item you wish to use and if you want to precisely move an object around forget about it. Doors - They all shut when you load a level. Which normally is fine, just reopen them. However, if somebody dies in a doorway and the game loads, the door is now shut on the dead body which causes the body to completely stop the door from opening ever again. This is quite infuriating especially if the door that cant open is the way you need to go. Overall though this game is really fun novelty but wait for it to go on sale before getting it is all.",

Yes, it was limited, but the kills were all unique, and you actually *GASP* had to do some detective work (read: stalking) to find the nessecary tools to kill your next victim.   Lucius 2 tries to be much more sandboxy and only partially makes it. The AI is pretty brain-dead, the levels a wee bit cramped and out of place. You can sneak by pressing control, but you wont need it once, as even if you do get caught you have at least 2 mind erases available. Combine all that with health from toilets, random gay sex in the bathrooms, and a saints row 'esque purple ♥♥♥♥♥ killer and you can easily form the opinion these guys arent taking the game seriously, and neither should you. But, that ruins immersion in a game like this. IF I want LOL RANDUMB things in games, then I'll go play a game that is tongue and cheek.   There is a nice variety of 'special' kills but there could have been so many more. After a few levels another new way pops up, and then its back to Poison sandwich, defib, elevator, fireaxe blah blah etc. Finally the uprade system is pretty bad. You have 3 skill trees to choose from; mind control, telekenesis, and pyro. Each individual 'talent' takes 3 points to.. well I'm not sure but I think it makes them last.. longer? The game isnt nearly long enough to get every single talent unlocked, but that doesn't matter, as more than half of them are pretty useless. I'm a BIG fan of fire in games, and when even I don't care enough to even put a single point in the entire pyro skill tree... that says a lot.  While I never had a problem with setting up traps and killing innocents, I see many others do. I would say this is a case of people not being patient enough or too slow (mentally) to not play a game where M1 = Kill. Yes there are a ton of bugs but none gamebreaking. I had ZERO save game problems, either loading or with corruption. I think many on here that do are full of it, and just want to join the bandwagon because they can't possibly form their own opinions on things, or being a troll in reviews is cool to.. them? Oh there are alwasy the people trying to run even a game like this on ancient hardware then trey to blame the developers because their 15 year old rigs crash every 10 seconds!  It's not the greatest game ever, but it's fun and is priced well for the content and length. Just like it's predecessor. I look forward eagerly to Lucius 3: The Sandwich Fandango  ",

We're all people and we all have the right to live our lives how we want to. I have much love for ALL people!  This game was partially broken on release but thankfully they've fixed it now :) So here's my NEW review!  PROS: - Play as the ♥♥♥♥ing anti-christ!! EPIC! - Kill people in creative and horrific ways! AWESOME! - See 2 gay guys having sex in a hospital bathroom....Why isn't this a con?.. Because I threw a jug of slippery fluid on them (:O) and watched as one man fell down and the other one just kept humping the air until I threw a vial of acid into the room killing them both. GOOD TIMES!  EDIT: This was NOT an enjoyable moment simply because I have any problem with homosexuality. It would have been just as fun if it'd been a man and a woman banging in the bathroom. But I must say that walking in on two guys was an epic curveball that made it that much funnier. Especially when the one guy just kept humping air. OMFG funny moment! And on top of that I applaud the developers for being open minded.  - Rather than following a cookie cutter script like in Lucius 1, this game allows you to kill basically any person in the game in basically any way you can think of. So you can completely clear a level and kill everyone or you can just kill those who are targets. COOL! - People have actual ♥♥♥♥♥ and balls! Complete with physics! :O - Umm did I mention the killing??...  CONS: - Meh graphics. - Meh Levels. (not as good as the first game IMO) - The story ♥♥♥♥ING SUCKS! At least in the first game they made a bit of an effort to make it feel like you really were playing the villain in a horror movie. And the cop investigating you was pretty decent too! Except I think he must've had a learning disability of sorts... But in Lucius II that cop sucks satan's ♥♥♥♥ (literally) in like the first 2 minutes of the poorly made cutscene and just joins Lucius' side on a ♥♥♥♥ing whim thus leaving you with no real opposition. Stupid idea on the dev's part in my opinion. PLUS the entire game feels like a ♥♥♥♥ing satire of itself! It's like the developers didn't even take it seriously so they figured ♥♥♥♥ it we'll just make it into a comedy. The first game was somewhat satirical as well but it also had some great horror elements. In a way this game just feels like a poorly executed joke with a ♥♥♥♥ ton of blood and gore.  - Buggy and awkward as hell at times! - Sometimes it's way too hard to kill people creatively so you'll fall back on the ol tried and true methods such as; Un-necessary defibrilation and poisoned donuts.  - The first game felt a bit more solid and well made, this one feels like they subbed the contract out to some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ nameless korean sweatshop game-making company.  SUMMARY: There is a lot about this game that sucks but honestly it's just not enough to make me not want to play it or reccommend it. Lucius 1 &amp; 2 are truly unique and thus have a bit of a monopoly on the 'antichrist simulator' market at the moment seeing as there really arent any other games like it. I'd really like to see the devs make a Lucius 3, but maybe actually take it a bit more seriously this time guys? It's not like it'd really be so morally reprehensible to make a game like this that doesn't play out like a ♥♥♥♥ing comedy. Sometimes It feels like developers are scared to make games like this that are serious and brutal because they'll be classified as monsters or some ♥♥♥♥... But in a world where people let their 10 year old children play GTA and Valve allows games like 'Hatred' to sell on the steam store I'm pretty sure people can handle a ♥♥♥♥ing serious horror villain-protagonist type of game... All in all I'd reccomend Lucius 2 if you're a sick ♥♥♥♥ and it's on sale for at least 50% off.",
