            "review_text": "Heaven's Hope has everything required for a good adventure game: nice animations &amp; backgrounds, constant attempt at humour, slow-paced gameplay, a good number of puzzles with solutions which make no sense and lots of guesswork &amp; trial &amp; error.  The experience of Heaven's Hope starts out very promising, art style and the uncommon plot immediately catches your attention. You visit new places, meet new people and collect everything you can. Sooner or later you reach a point where you end up with a lot of items and no idea what you're missing. There is a hint system in the game but in my gameplay the advice given was rarely relevant to what I needed to move forward. So you start revisiting everywhere and everyone and you realize that the game relies upon trigger events as the solution of story progression problem, something I didn't particularly enjoy. Fast travelling using the map eases this pain which negatively impacts your overall experience throughout the game and searching for the next interaction can be boring.  In every adventure game, there is this specific point where you start to lose interest in the middle of the story. After that, Heaven's Hope manages to pick up speed and wraps up the storyline without dragging it too much in about 7 hours in total. I recommend Heaven's Hope to every adventure gamer, it's better than most of the recent point &amp; click alternatives and a better than average game in general. Also, it was a nice change to play a game with a religious theme which doesn't constantly try to lecture the player on how ridiculous and horrible religion is. I hope the developers build up on this and we'll see more from them in the future.",
