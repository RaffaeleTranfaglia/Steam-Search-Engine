            "review_text": "While I didn't really enjoy Animal Gods, the game has some redeeming qualities which could make some people enjoy the game a lot more than I did.   The biggest problem I had with Animal Gods is that it is just a pretty boring game. The art style is pretty good and the story could be interesting but the game play drags down the game in my opinion. The controls work fine but the mechanics just aren't that interesting. The dash ability is fun for a while but I was kind of bored with it by the end of the 'dungeon'. The combat in the game is pretty dull since all you have to do is find a safe spot close enough to the enemies to be able to strike them without being hit since the enemies won't chase you.  If you like games that mostly focus on the art style and story I think you could enjoy Animal Gods quite a bit. If the game play is most important to you though, I would at least wait for a sale to purchase Animal Gods.  Note: I received a free review copy from the developer.

With the cool graphics, promising story and all. But I just cannot. The game is simply too frustrating, even for a simple game that makes you beat inanimate boxes to death. And sometimes the game gives you a variation by telling me to calmly strolling on an empty quiet huge space. How's that calming. Also, The checkpoint system needs an overhaul to say the least, and I bet the people that play this would agree with me.  And that's only few points that I had to bring up because I am agreeing with every single negative reviews here so no need to write them down twice.",

            "review_text": "There are games that can get away with refusing to explain themselves or making use of interesting and alternative art to convey something one could not otherwise do.  This does not appear to be one of them.  The most immediately upsetting factor is the way the game appears to try and disguise the cheapness of its graphics as a stylistic choice. Yet the innumerable rectangular paths, enemies and elements betray the fundamental cheapness of the game. A cheapness that simply cannot be papered over by the otherwise quite interesting art.  Worse still, it simply isn't any fun.  A game of combat must be a test of skill, of mastery. It should challenge the player and demand that they understand how to utilize the mechanics of the game to the fullest.  A game of puzzles must contain meaningfully interesting puzzles, rather than pretend as if defeating enemies moving in set patterns is even remotely interesting.  In the end, I can only ask the developers why they thought anyone would actually wish to play this, and if they don't know, why they tried to push it to sales, rather than learn to make something people would like.",
