            "review_text": "This is probably the nicest review I will ever write for a game I hate. That's because regardless of how I feel about it, Volgarr exists to do one thing, and that is imitate the old hard-as-balls 16-bit platformers of yore. And it does it really, really, really well.  You play Volgarr the Viking, unsurprisingly, risen from his grave by some totally metal deity to kill a whole bunch of everything. He controls like a slightly less-sticky Castlevania protagonist, with no air control unless you double-jump, certain attacks locking him in place, and being launched backwards (usually into pits) every time he gets hit. He does have a bevy of moves like a downward strike, a roll, and some very useful spears to throw that can also form platforms. It feels just like playing a classic SNES side-scroller, and that extends to the graphics and sounds as well. Pixel blood and bones fly as you hack and slash through the game's many varied levels.  IF you can get to them. The make-or-break issue with Volgarr is how much patience you have for punishingly hard platforming. The game uses a very Ghosts 'n' Goblins system where you find bits of armor to bolt on to yourself that then get knocked off a couple pieces at a time by enemies. Your shield is one of those pieces, and if you lose it, certain traps are going to be all but impassable. This is to say nothing of the many bottomless pits and trap enemies waiting just off screen to knock you into them. All of this would be fine, except that the levels are made up of two quite lengthy sections with only a single checkpoint between them. This means any mistakes you make are punished with redoing the last couple minutes of exacting platforming again. And with no checkpoint before bosses, just learning their patterns or performing less than perfectly can force you to replay 5+ minutes of level you've already had to suffer through.  This to me is just straight-up bad design, evidenced by how few games make use of similarly punishing systems now. It is forgiven only because it was the standard for NES classics such as Castlevania and Mega Man, except that even those games had multiple checkpoints per level. It becomes a question of how much of your time a game is allowed to waste when you make a mistake, because doing the same level opening ten times because you can't quite get a boss's pattern down immediately is very much a waste of time. Modern games like Dark Souls have found elegant solutions to this problem, such as allowing you to accumulate resources across attempts. Volgarr makes no provision for that, forcing the same actions over and over until it (hopefully) becomes muscle memory.  I really did hate Volgarr when I started playing it, but after a little more time with it I came to at least appreciate what it represents. When I was a kid, I had the patience to beat my head against Ninja Gaiden II for weeks and weeks until I could finally finish it. I don't have the time or the inclination for that kind of dedicated memorization anymore, but I can see where there might still be space for it. Volgarr is very much not for everyone and smacks of the kind of game that gets recommended by everyone and played by no one, but if you really, truly are looking for that brick wall NES difficulty curve, look no further.",

At first I found it frustrating, then infuriating, and now... Now, I find it amazing.  It runs very smoothly (important for a game reliant on precision control). Even though you have a limited number of moves, you will learn how to combo them together, and each move has several uses. Roll to dodge, move faster, or make a small hop down a ledge. Jumping combined with spear-stepping can let you climb a flat wall. Double-jump can become a major attack, and when combined with the spear throw you can take out some stronger enemies in a single combo.  A full run takes anywhere from 30 minutes to just over an hour, depending on how much you die. If you can't sit down and play the full game in one run (or simply get frustrated), you can continue along 'Path C' with the warps, to any world you've previously reached.  If you are easily frustrated, this may not be the game for you. If you're a speedrunner, a completionist, or just like a good challenge, look into Volgarr.

Cons: - No in-air control, takes some time to get used to. - Can be frustrating at times.  The thing to understand about Volgarr is that it's less a true platformer, and more a real-time puzzle masquerading as one. Each level consists of a string of little areas with some platforms, enemies, and sometimes environmental hazards. And in each area there is at least one series of actions, that, one you've found it, will allow you to path unscathed 100% of the time. At first, figuring out how to pass each area requires a lot of trial and error. But as you get used to controls, and learn enemy movement and attack patterns, you'll be able to come up with solutions on the fly. This actually makes the alternative 'hard' path of the game somewhat easier than the 'easy' path, as by the time you attempt to do it, you're much better at the game.",

You plod along, hopping about, dying a lot, learning the levels, and generally barely avoiding boredom because nothing in this game is done especially well.  Until...  You find the second game. As you repeat the levels over and over, you start to get a feel for what needs to be done. You'll brush up against that second game a few times before you finally realize what's going on. The levels are actually meticulously designed. If you move quickly, throw spears at the right times, and generally play the game as if you're speedrunning, the levels will come together. Every single stupid thing in the game becomes easily surmountable when you deal with it the second it comes on the screen. Enemies will line up perfectly to be killed with one spear, platforming will go by as quick as Volgarr's lumbering gait takes him...  This is the true Volgarr the Viking. It's not a platformer in the classic since, it's a trial and error speedrunner without the speed. Almost like a rhythm game at times only you can really only find out what the notes are and when by blindly stumbling over them and restarting anew. Since the game's final level can really only be unlocked by beating each level without getting hit and with finding the secret macguffin in each level, this really is what they intended for the game.  It's meticulously designed to foster perfect play while doing next to nothing to teach perfect play. Hell, the game barely teaches you the core mechanics except in one of those passive tutorials that people who watched that one MMX1 video are so fond of.  The problem is... it still doesn't make the game all that good. Any imperfect run just falls back into that first, really boring game (Only now with the knowledge that you are screwed out of anything satisfying knowing what you missed.), and high-end Volgarr play just does not satisfy enough to be worth the trial and error grinding to perfect each level.",

These said monsters keep coming up all the time so you better move since they won't run dry. The gameplay reminds a bit of old NES game Trojan in a not so positive way (oh the slow walking, oh the stifness of my actions).  You can hit, jump, point your sword downwards while jumping, do a sort of a double-jump by slashing in mid-air and throw a javelin that also works as a platform for you. You can't change direction or control the jumping much so better not spam it too much.  Then the straight-up bs part:  Volgarr attempts to be hard. Real hard. IT sure is difficult but the difficulty comes from mistakes you make over and over again while playing the same part until you get it right and move to next nasty room. This TOO is usual, nothing too bad. BUT. Everytime I died I felt that 'was that something I should've guessed?' or 'if the controls were any better this could be easily done'. Both of these could be dismissed as a bad player ranting but I've done my share of hard platformers like Ninja Gaiden, Battletoads, 100% completed Meat Boy and went through Spelunky without serious problems to name a few.  Worst part is that the gameplay feels so clunky that I don't want to get accustomed to it.   Good parts:  -Window closes quite fast when quitting the game.",

However if you try to go for hard mode (before entering a new level go to it through Valkyrie statue) you have limited lives which you can collect when u have full gear (shield, helmet, flame sword) from the chests. Loose all your lives and you get teleported to 'normal mode'. If you die on last 7th level (Yggdrasil) with your last live then it's game over... Not game over but Ending B..

The one major change from games of that era is infinite lives: No longer do you only have 10, or 3, or even just 1 try to learn and beat an area before you have to start over. Instead, it breaks it down into well-paced but brutal sections, and death sends you back to the beginning of the section.

Knowing and personalizing the controls is the first step in beating this; being able to have every control down will help a lot, since this game requires you to be able to deftly dodge and strike when needed. The bosses can be very puzzle like, since you need to know when to dodge, strike, or otherwise act.  Volgarr has two attacks: sword and spear. The sword will probably be used most often, but throwing the spear not only gives you a ranged attack, but can also MAKE A PLATFORM TO STAND AND JUMP FROM. That's incredible! And this isn't just a feature, you are required to use this ability to make it through the game. Alive. There are many secret areas that make you think 'I know what to do, but how', as you need to figure out where to throw spears and where to jump onto those spears.  Volgarr, being a viking, is a badass. Enemies, being dangerous, can rip Volgarr's armor off to kill him. You don't have a health bar, so much as armor. You start with your shield, a buckler. THEN you upgrade to a better metal shield. THEN you get a helmet! THEN A FLAMING SWORD! Each hit you endure will take a piece of armor off, until you have no shield and thus cannot block attacks. This makes being hit a punishment, not an inconvenience, which I absolutely love.  Notes: You can try to avoid enemies altogether to stay alive. You can zoom out, making the graphics better and plan ahead easier. You can set the Zoom out to Toggle which will help a LOT. You can try to learn all the controls, I mean ALL, to look badass and flashy while also retaining armor.  Bottom Line is; I love this game and absolutely recommend it's full price. It's hard but very rewarding, in a way that games like Rastan, Dark Souls, older Zelda games, and even Super Mario World portray. If you are easily angered, however, probably don't buy this. You will die a lot before you develop a strategy.",

            "review_text": "When you finish your first session of Volgarr, one thing becomes abundantly clear : Either you're in love or you've simply wasted your money.  This game is extremely hard but manages to strike that balance between frustration and that wonderful feeling of accomplishment that only comes from punitive, hardcore games. If the level design and enemy behaviors weren't expertly handled I would've stopped playing a long time ago. Fortunately, this game is very precisely and masterfully crafted and I just can't put it down.  There is no way around it, you will have to memorize enemy patterns, attacks and level layouts in order to progress. Getting hit means losing a power-up, just like in Super Mario Bros. While it is possible to keep trudging forward without these power-ups, it makes the game a whole lot trickier  If you manage to get through a level without getting hit, you get more Gold and a chance to play a bonus level. In this way, Volgarr forces you into Speedrunning. If you don't like old-school games where repetition and pattern mastery is obligatory, you will hate Volgarr.  Super Meat boy is the most recent example of this kind of experience; It's a game which is hard but its pacing and level length / instant respawn was crafted to make sure that you'd give it just one more try before heading to bed. Once you cleared a level, it felt abolutely amazing. The same applies to Volgarr.  At first, Volgarr evokes classics Altered Beast and Rastan; in fact, it could be argued that the first level is largely a re-telling of Rastan's first level. As the game progresses, you'll see some Mega Man, elements from Chakan : The forever man and even bits of QuackShot!  This game is obviously targeted at old-school hardcore gamers; if you fit the description, I really don't see how you can not enjoy Volgarr. It is truly a modern classic masterpiece.",

If you play it, you will die, a lot. You will die learning the best ways to combat different enemies, you will die learning to master the jumping for the admittedly simple platforming, you will die learning the level, you will die learning the attack patterns of the bosses.  However, when you vanquish the boss for that first time. When you surpass in five minutes an admittedly short level that before took you forty-five. You will feel like a king.  Its a must-buy if you, like me, love games that provide an incredible (One could almost say unfair) challenge. Otherwise do not bother, it will be a waste of your time.",

That was a game I liked as a kid but never got much into because the game never seemed worth suffering its own difficulty. This game falls into the same category for me. It's got so much good stuff, but the start-over-from-way-back-when-you-die mechanic really died out for me with the Super Nintendo. The notion that fun is replaying a large section over and over again where one hit equates to failure isn't my cup of tea anymore. It also features that other classic mechanic: knock-back-on-hit (if you're lucky, not straight into a pit). So despite the moderately udpated retro graphics, a decent soundtrack, and controls that feature some depth, the game fails to be something I'd recommend in general. If you're looking for an old school feel in a modern package, this may be one of the best offerings in that regards. But for someone who has played hundreds of those games, and is no longer looking for that kind of time wasting or frustration potential, I have to pass. 6/10  ",

However, it doesn't work like a regular double jump... No no, it's like this : say you're going to the right and press jump once, your character will jump to the right. Now if you jump with a direction input while you're in air, your character will keep the same direction, which means that you cannot land precisely where you want...  Yes I know, you can jump once in a direction then jump while in air with no direction input to land below... But to me, that's totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and it feels like jumping with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ - I thought - and it really seemed - that Volgarr was badass like Ragnar, the ♥♥♥♥ is this ♥♥♥♥ seriously ? :s  TLDR : I hate the jump mechanics, feels like Robocop trying to jump... and for this I cannot recommend this game although I like most of it, god I hate you guys !",

My main issue is the check points being SO far apart, and then there's a big boss guy, and he kills you, and you're back at the start of the level again... that old nemesis. But, it's really fun getting back to that point and seeing your skills increase. I just wish it was progressing through new levels more quickly.

            "review_text": "This game was made as a love-letter to a very specific sort of gamer and game experience. I come to this title though more as an outsider, someone who played some 90s games but never really went to arcades or spent dozens of hours perfecting the way I finished one specific game level. I came to this game mostly based on a few friend recommendations and some gameplay clips, as a fan of pixel-art and platforming.  The Good: I really admire this game's design focus. After just a few minutes of play it was obvious that the developers had a specific vision for this game and they pursued that vision with dogged determination. Everything that did not directly support their vision was stripped out, leaving a pure experience behind. Read the developer's description of the game and you will find it closely matches what gameplay is actually like (the description is not full of hype but cold hard facts). For me it felt so much like a 90s platformer that when Steam notifications popped up during gameplay it was almost jarring.   The Bad: Because this game is so focused on giving the player a specific experience if you find you don't like that experience the game quickly loses all charm. You progress through levels by memorizing every step of the level, learning when to throw spears off screen to kill enemies you haven't even seen yet and where exactly to stand to avoid attacks that haven't even started yet. There is no room for different play-styles, personal touches, or emergent storytelling of any kind. There is almost no randomness or exploration of any kind, with this game rewarding players who have the memory and finger-precision to do the same thing over and over. As a result the game is as brutish as the titular Viking, and as exacting as his well-sharpened sword. And that's okay because that is what this game is supposed to be. Just make sure that what you want from this game matches what this game is designed to give you, otherwise it will just be a waste of your time and money.  The Verdict: I recommended this game because it does what it is supposed to do, and it does it very well. If what you have read about this game so far is really resonating with you this game will likely be a good buy. But I personally did not enjoy my time with it, mostly because it doesn't match my own gaming tastes. There are a few friends I know though who still love their old platformers, and I might just let them know that this game exists.",
