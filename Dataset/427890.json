The mini-games are fun and offer decent replay value to get good at them. Yes the game is a bit short and shallow for what it offers but the game is also priced pretty fair for what it offers.  This would be a good family game for the local co-op, and I think its a pretty good first VR game to show people as the environments are nice and the mini games are easy to understand.  I would LOVE if they kept adding onto this with the same atmosphere and art style",
