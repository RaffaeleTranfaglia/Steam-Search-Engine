            "review_text": "I saw this game and figured, well I really like WWII, enjoy flight games, and it's free, I guess I might as well try it. Boy was that a mistake. To say this game is a simulation game is an insult to even the worst flight sims out there. You have two directions of movement. Up and down, Left or Right. Essentially you only have Pitch and Yaw. They attempt to make it look like you have roll by automatically in the direction your turning, but that's it. Also, you pitch stops at the 180 degree mark. You can go straight up or straight down, but you can't do a loop of any kind. So basically you can't preform even the most basic of combat manoeuvers. In other words the controls are very basic, which you would think would be a good thing for a casual game, but it goes against even the most basic principles of slight. As far long term gameplay and progression, I really can't say much as I never intend to play this game again. Seriously, if you are interested in a free WWII flight sim, go for Warthunder. Much better graphics, much better controls, basically much better everything. And you can even drive tanks too! Seriously guys, avoid this one like the plague. World of Warplanes is significantly better than this, and that's saying A LOT!",

I play warthunder religiously, i decided to give this a chance. it didnt even deserve the chance.   Pro: another ww1/2 game. Got me excited.

            "review_text": "At first when I saw all the negative reviews, I didn't want to download this game, but then I saw a positive review saying that the game isn't meant to be realistic or like war thunder in any way. So I thought: Well since most of the negative reviews hates on the game's flight models and stuff, and the game isn't supposed to be realistic, and it's actually supposed to be an MMORPG but with planes, I decided to give it a shot.  Here are the pros and cons:  Pros: - Easy to learn  - Don't have to pay to win or to have fun  - Tons of planes   - Tons of missions  - Missions can be played in co-op, or alone  - PvP and PvE modes  - Can run smoothly on any computer  - No lag   - Easy to level up  - Easy to get new upgrades  - Not a grind fest, making money and getting unlocks and rewards is quick and easy.  - Lots of parts and items to upgrade your plane with  - Storage warehouse for un-used items  - Tons of Quests that gives you bonus rewards  - Extremely detailed tutorial quests to teach you how to play the game  - Fun to play  Cons: - The game's graphics look like it's from 1996  - The damage model is just a simple health bar, no individual components that can take damage  - Can't do barrel rolls or loops  - No plane engine sounds  - All guns sounds the same  - You can fly through enemies without taking damage  - Only 3 different death animations for planes, 1: The plane's engines starts burning, and a wing breaks off, and the plane spirals to the ground and explodes. 2: The plane's engines starts burning, and the plane spirals to the ground and explodes. 3: The plane doesn't burn or anything, it just spirals to the ground and explodes.  - No throttle control   Overall I find it fun to play the game, even though the controls and gameplay is really simple and easy, and the graphics are from the 1990's. It just feels fun to play, and there's a lot of content. Even more content than some AAA games. It has almost as much content as War Thunder. Lots of maps, planes, missions, weapons, upgrades, and so on. If this game had tanks like War Thunder, then I would say they have the same amount of content. It's still a great game though.  Long story short: Great game, great fun, tons of content, no grinding for money or levels, you should totally try it out!",

            "review_text": "Alright so there are so many people posting negative reviews who have no idea what they are talking about. Look the game is not new! It is a steam release of a game that has been around for a few years. I started playing HIS when is came out a few years ago and it is a great ARCADE game!!! I am a licensed aircraft mechanic by trade and play all games involving aircraft. I love War Thunder because it is an amazing SIMULATION aviation game. I play HIS because it is a fun ARCADE aviation game. HIS has a lot of aircraft that were experimentals like the Vought XF5U (Flying Flapjack). Warthunder does not have many experimentals.   Basically, if you come into this ARCADE flying game and expect it to be like a SIMULATION game you are in the wrong place. I personally like the item, upgrade, and skill systems in this game. It is a relaxing way to pass some time with airplanes. Please stop trying to compare it to games that are not meant to be its competition.",

            "review_text": "Now, before you make an assumption that I am 'just another twit who doesn't know the game', be advised that the time is just my Steam. I played this way before it was on Steam, immediately before school, etc, etc. I'd make an estimate of at least 50 or more hours spent.  This game is, to me, a good example of an arcade. It is not meant to be realistic; that would be for the simulators, like War Thunder, World of Warplanes, or DSC World. It is not meant to be realistic; it's meant to enjoy the murdering of your enemy as you spam machineguns and missiles (which are mildly seeking).  Those who complain about the graphical aspects...it's graphics suck. I will be blatantly honest, they are flat, and at times, they suck. The people do not look realistic. For all sakes, it is from 2007, and graphics aren't everything. That's like watching pornography for the good storyline. You are enjoying the gameplay...for all sake, people play Minecraft, Terraria, and others, and they do not have the best graphics. To me, that is just a plus...means my PC can actually run it.  I think this game is bombarded by twits who do not understand the concept nor the time; it was 2007.  11/10, I will continue to play.  EDIT  OK, so I've played it for a while and...this game is not the one I played before. Lemme explain.  There are multiple errors in the game. First off, and most apparent, is the grammar. This might not be such a great issue...but as I said, I played it before. The Gamescampus version did not have those issues, and changing what is clearly a done job to a worse job is not good. In addition, in the Axis tech tree, certain Japanese aircraft are named in German. That is NOT what you do, and annoying. Again, minor yet was not present in the previous version.  Next off is the 'supply missions'. This involves flying-about and going through floating boxes made of wood. This is random, to me. It's also not fun, because all you are doing is flying. No, that is not good gameplay.  Next is the gameplay actions. In certain missions, the GM can choose what they want to do. This usually involves certain class-oriented goals, like 'Attack retreating troops' or 'another target is spotted'. This, this I like. It provides a certain amount of choice in the player's day. However, there is one mission (d*mn me, but I don't remember it) where you can also choose 'supply crates found'. If you choose this, retreating troops appear, and vice versa. This, this I do not like.  Next is the AI. Before, it was OK that there was quality of quantity. However, I played, recently, the 'Weapons Testing' mission on Allies where one flies against ME-262s. For those who don't know, these are jet fighters Germany fielded near the end of the war. As such, they suck in a turning-battle, yet are amazing in a run-and-gun scenario. I'm in a prop plane. What do they do? Engage me in a turning-battle where I am guarenteed to win. This is annoying and easily moronic.  I also have some complaint on the faction numbers. Simply put, there are more Allies than Axis. This makes it extremely hard to play Axis, and extremely easy to play as Allies. This is something I, personally, don't like.  I have come to realize that, while the majority of twits don't understand it, those who do should understand that it was FAR better before, and this is an unacceptable downgrade.",
