It's awesome, witty dialouge, amazing score and sound effects and outstanding animation by Don Bluth will have you wanting to play this game again and again. All modes of difficulty are pretty hard to beat without dying, but you feel rewarded by the end when you defeat Borf. Score does not even matter.",

            "review_text": "Space Ace ditches the short, random dungeon room design from before and features much longer stages that all play similarly to Dragon's Lair's awesome final scene. There are even branching paths throughout depending on if you energize into Ace or not. The same fundamental problems still remain from before, but Space Ace is still an improvement in every possible way over its predecessor.",
