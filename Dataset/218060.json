            "review_text": "Graphics/Design - 8 Sound - 9 Gameplay - 10 Value - 6  This game really came out of nowhere for me. Having never played any of the Bit Trip games, I'd read rave reviews about this game and about how good it was. The first thing you notice when you start the game are the vibrant colors and beautiful backgrounds. The art style is really clean and crisp; it makes everything easy to see and prepare for. This is important because every jump, slide, bounce, block, super bounce and slide jump you do are all in rhythm to the song playing in each level. Bad controls would absolutely break this game because of how time sensitive it is so I'm happy to say they are nearly flawless. A players success with this game is going to be solely based on how good their hand-eye coordination is. With sound being so important it's a good thing then, that the music is generally upbeat and enjoyable. It gives a relaxing feel that works well even though the game itself is about timing and reaction.   If you pick up every item in a level and beat it you get a 'Perfect' rating. You can also get a 'Perfect+' which is picking up every item along with getting shot out of a canon that moves up and down and hitting a red bullseye at the end of a level. This can be really frustrating if you're trying to get Perfect+ on every level, say for an achievement that requires it. You might be playing on hard and on the 10th try you finally beat the level, pick up every item and now it's time to try and hit the bullseye. There's no surefire way to hit it other than sort of feeling it's the right moment to fire. If you miss and you want the Perfect+ you'll have to play the whole level over again to get the chance to hit the bullseye again. This is literally the only thing in the game that might detract from someones enjoyment of it in any way.   It's not a huge game taking around 5 hours to get through the first time but Hard mode is where the game really shines as it fills in a lot more of the song with obstacles and enemies that are missing on easier difficulties. You can also play 8-bit retro levels that are hidding throughout stages. I didn't find them anywhere near as enjoyable as the main game however. Bottom line, this is a great game that should be enjoyed by everywhere and a game that can brighten your day whenever you play it.   Single Player Play Time - 5-6 hours  Overall 8.5",

On Hard this game is true challenge for your reflexes and concentration and Easy mode is great for kids. Visually this game is beautiful with amazing animations in background and on characters. Music is also amazing and it is pleasure to play this game for hours just to listen music and melodies that you create jumping around and collecting gold bars. I recomend this game to all Bit.Trip Runner, SMB, Rayman players, you will have fun/challenges for days and months :D",

I found the original BIT.TRIP.RUNNER to get really frustrating really quickly, but RUNNER 2 has varying difficulties and much more forgiving checkpoints, and it has a nice cartoony aesthetic and style (and a goofy narrator) that elevates it's silly lightheartedness to RAYMAN levels. It's really enjoyable. It's also one of the few games that really gets me in 'the zone'.  And dang, that Disco dancin' Cheezborger guy is just so smooooooth.",

            "review_text": " BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien  is the second Runner game in the BIT.TRIP series, where you control the Rhythm Alien.  Yeah.  So what's it all about? You control this vaguely rectagonal fella called CommanderVideo and you run, jump, kick, block, and do a whole lot of other activities in order to reach the end of a level. The levels are handcrafted so that avoiding obstacles and getting items contributes to the music (as usual for the BIT.TRIP). There are 120 levels in 3 difficulty levels and 25 hidden retro chalenges to complete spread through five different worlds.  The graphics are pretty without being overly flashy or distracting while the music is top notch. The controls are tight enough and the level design has a very fine-tuned difficulty curve. All in all, the game is long and provides a good replay value, in part thanks to the online leaderboards.   Whether or not you have played the original Runner, and whether or not you like music games in general, B.TP...R2:FLoRA is very much worth your attention!  For those who are familiar with Runner 1: They have improved and expanded every single aspect of the game. That's all.",

'This game is best played using a controller'.   Then why the helvede is there no support for my (relatively) old Logitech Rumblepad 2. Even tried binding the buttons to keyboard presses using the Logitech profiler software, but those petty tricks is no match for this game's stubbornness.  Anywho, onward and upwards with my trusty wired gaming keyboard. This proved less than optimal, as there's a really noticable input lag. I know it's part of the game design that you remember the pattern of the obstacles anyways, meaning that you should be able to simply adjust the timing of memorized keypresses. But under normal circumstances good reflexes can make up for what you forget - so NOT being able to do so in the very last stages of the game ups the difficulty A LOT.  Lower the difficulty to grandma mode you say? NEVAH!  The first 85% of the game is mostly smooth and enjoyable sailing, but the last parts had me yelling at the monitor. It didn't seem to mind though.  If it weren't for the aforementioned technical problems, I'd give this charming rythmic platformer a respectable 80%, but I can't justify more than 65%.   ",

My sense of rhythm and eyesight are both pretty terrible, so it was too much for me. Runner2 improves upon the original in every way, though the art style might be harder for some to read.  Revolving around a constant runner of your choice, you have to enter a series of combinations that both make music and allow your runner to progress to the end of the level. It may sound simple enough, but the difficulty ramps up on its own, and the level of challenge can be controlled by the player. The levels rarely feel too long, and the check point can be a life saver.  Runner2 constantly gives incentives to keep you going, with humorous costumes and characters to unlock, leaderboards, retro levels, and great animation. The reverse merman and disco hamburger had me grinning even when I was stuck on the same section for an extended period.   Runner 2 is aesthetically pleasing with simple mechanics, great challenge, and lots of personality.  ****The DLC is a great character pack. The characters offered in the pack are beloved and sure to please many gamers. Just like the characters unlocked in the base game, these characters are just cosmetically different, with great animation and style.",

Which is pretty pointless. Why not earn it by skipping the checkpoint instead? - A tad too easy, even on Rather Hard. - Stupid humor to be found throughout the game (such as the level names 'Tripping on Herbs' and 'Sweaty Dangle'. There's more.)  BIT.TRIP Presents... Runner2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a great spinoff of the BIT.TRIP games and might even be the best auto-runner game yet.

This game is so simplistic in its design but executed so well. From the smiling trees in the backgrounds to the silly floating enemies watching you as you hop on by, this is game truly shows character.     When a game developer puts time, love, and care into a game you can feel it, you can feel everything that the designers and artists felt.

            "review_text": "Runner2 is the game that you didn't know you wanted. Gameplay is of a platforming-meets-rhythm persuasion, where your character runs forward at a fixed pace and you have to clear obstacles that spawn in time with the soundtrack. The soundtrack is gorgeous, by the way.   Bad at rhythm games? That's fine! Runner2 uses clear visuals with vivid colors to help you know exactly when you need to jump, duck, kick, block, or dance your way to victory, and it gives you the entire first world to become familiar with those mechanics. Bad at timing in general? That's also fine! There are three difficulty settings to give challenge for those who want a challenge, without the frustration for those who don't.  The Runner2 experience is that when you are doing well, you feel it. You are rewarded with pleasant changes in music, sound effects, and visuals. Your senses are bombarded with happy things, and you can't help but enjoy yourself. Unfortunately, when you perform poorly, you feel that as well. Stages that you just can't seem to get past are frustrating, though there is some satisfaction in finally figuring them out. There is no redemption, however, for the times that you stupidly mess up the very last step in a stage and have to start over. At least there's checkpoints this time around.  Is this game for everyone? Pretty much yes, though maybe not at its original asking price. Buying this with the soundtrack was a good decision for me, but so was waiting for a sale. You can complete the story in 5-10 hours, with 100% completion taking closer to 20-30 hours. If you're a quantity-over-quality type person, wait for the price to drop down a touch. Otherwise, put on your running shoes and join Commander Video as he tries to reach the right side of the screen.",

On the other hand, it's one of the most logically designed games with a smart difficulty ramp up that, ♥♥♥♥, really gets hard as hell the farther you go.

The premise is simple: get from one end of the level to the other in a free-flowing smooth run. But this game is not for the people who have slow reactions times or get frustrated easily. It is hard, and quite unforgiving. Repetition is going to happening in this game, but because of the quick reload and charming music, it's hard to feel put out.  When you do get a great run going, it's fantastic. All the notes and melodies stiched together with your actions makes it a grand way to know you're doing well. Not to mention that it also helps timing your moments with the logical note progression.  Over the multiple different worlds, there are retro levels, multiple paths and different bosses to change things up, and the dastardly combinations of different moments makes you really appreciate the level design - which may appear simplistic at times - but it very finely tuned.  This game is great in short bursts for those that don't have much time, it's great for those wanting a challenge, and especially if you like the recognition for seamlessly stringing together your levels and actions. Everything about this game screams that the developer cared about making their game. From the cutscenes narrated by Charles Martinet (who also does the voice for Mario) right down to the charming animations and fluid movement.

For no reason.   Retro gamers will find solace in the voice of the announcer. I'll leave it at that, those that know the name will KNOW the name.  Also, it's important to note that if you suck at this game, it's entirely your fault. You can blame the controller, maybe lag, anything. Find something, and blame it. You'll know deep down in the back of your mind it's because you ♥♥♥♥ed up. It was YOUR fault you fell in that hole. It's YOUR fault you ran into those spikes.  And it will eat at you. You'll get ♥♥♥♥♥♥, walk away, smash your controller/PC/monitor, but...  You'll be back.   You'll always come back.",

You get your moneys worth playing it on the easier difficulties, but it is the semi OCD completionist mindset that this game really comes alive. Three difficulties for every level across five worlds requiring to play a game at luck after each level to see if you can move on or not will definitely have you ripping out your hair for that perfect 100%. It is the reason why this game took me 61 hours spread across two years to complete. This game has alot of intersting mechanics that keep the game fun and interesting such as the retro mode and multiple pathways aswell as beautiful scnery unique to every level. I enjoyed all of it up until the final world when it became repetitive and seemed unoriginal with the sky being a set image not moving. However I am just nitpicking my complaints. The bullseye mechanic however it total rubbish in my opinion and has frustrated me to the extent that I had to replay the final level 9 times on the hardest difficulty to finally 100% the game. What is a bullseye you ask? Well the bullseye is if you perfect the level (as in get every gold piece aswell as upgrade) you have the chance to shoot yourself out of a cannon onto a dart board. To fully complete the level you have to get it right in the centre, which is a pain. If you fail this you have to replay the entire level nomatter how difficult it was because as a completionist you cannot get the achievement for 100% the game without doing this in every level. Seriously guys.  If however you don't plan on getting 100% you will find this game extremely enjopyable and vivid with life in a world wich emmerses you and is a gernerally feel-good game. Brilliant job guys. Truly.",

This sequel contains more than 100 levels, a lot of costumes to unlock, it also has access to the glorious 'retro' levels, the 8-Bit era! The biggest different between Runner 2 and the original would be the visuals, Runner 2 has very colorful and beautifully levels.   One of the things that most players ask was a middle checkpoint on this game, personally i don't see the point of adding a checkpoint on this game but the devs did make some players wish come true. You know have the chance to go throw, but if you pass the checkpoint you won't get some points, so you have two chances, either pass the checkpoint and be safe next time you miss the floor or don't go throw the checkpoint and gain some extra points.   My only complain would be the motion blur on this game, at least for me causes lot of headaches and dizziness, only if the game had a option to turn it off would be much better.   In case you are looking to something addictive, fun, was to test your skills, well Runner 2 is strongly recommend to you!   ~ 7.5/10",

The landscapes are great. My favouite world was the 5th (BIT.TRIP)  Sounds/Music[9/10]: Scenario-fitting music and sounds. Sometimes really calm, sometimes really speedy. And the sounds are just great. Really good job.   Story[5/10]: I think the story could've been better. It was a little dull to me. I didnt really knew what was going on. Make the 3rd game's story better :).  Gameplay[6/10]: For my side, I've played with the keyboard, since I don't have a controller and oh man.... It was really bad. I've always mixed up the buttons(A,S,D,W,H,J,K) and it was not fun. I can only blame myself for it, I will buy a new controller. But in the end I've experienced the controls. I'd say though the moves were pretty nice, and it was a lot of fun playing it. The obstacles had a nice variety, too   Uniqueness[8/10]: I think you can't be indifferent with this game. You either love it, or you either hate it. And this virtue gives it a really nice feel.  Difficulty[2/10]: This is one of if not the hardest games I've ever played. I might be a n00b, but sometimes i had a really big struggle playing it on QUITE EASY gamemode. It isn't unfinishable though. I feel SMB is easier than this ;-;.  Characters[10/10]: Very nice variety of characters. I died at the costume called 'F♥♥♥ing Turkey Suit'. Has more than 20 costumes which you can choose from. Has 7 unique characters. It's really funny. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pros: +character and costume variety +beautiful and funny landscapes and graphics +lots of unique moves +lots of unique obstacles +collectable things +funny gamemodes Cons: -hard bosses -hard difficulty -sometimes repeatable landscapes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Overall[8/10]: I think you should try it out.

It simply didn't feel as challenging (no 'Gauntlet' or 'Odyssey' here), and the characters and 3D effects were really off-putting. The only thing that kept me playing were the in-game 'challenges' and the ability to dance around in between jumps and other moves, which essentially allowed me to show off (the entire reason I play BIT.TRIP games). There are still chances to play retro levels, but part of the original BIT.TRIP RUNNER appeal was that it looked like a classic arcade game the whole time. I'm still a fan of the franchise but Runner2 was simply not what I was expecting in the slightest.

While this game may be tough at times, it's just so much fun to play. Don't think of this as a typical platformer, though. It's a rhythm-based game, so it's entirely on-rails and you have to press the right button at the right time. But the rhythm within the levels actually affect the game's music, which is the game's strongest feature. It's just so amazing to listen to, like with the rest of Gaijin Game's lineup. The collectables in the game are...alright. They don't really change anything about the game, other than the character you play as and how they look. I think if the character/costume selected affected the soundtrack any, it would definitely be worth going after everything. Though...I do like seeing Commander Video in Little Mac's training outfit from Punch-Out. That definitely gave me a bit of a giggle.  Alright, why are you still here? Go buy this game right now.",

However I find with most of them it tends to be a little untrue, with most things I can easily play the game with a keyboard and mouse regaurdless. However with Runner 2 the controls are really not made for a pc gamer. The left side of the keyboard has keys mapped virtically and the right side has them mapped horizontally and as far as I can tell there is no way to change them. This sounds simple but it really takes getting used to and when you first start playing can really get on your nerves.

Running to the right has been done many times before... BUT the BIT.TRIP Runner series is great in that it is the love child of a side-scrolling platformer and a rhythm game (such as DDR, Beatmania, or dare I say Guitar Hero).  Adding the dance move to be done in between jumping, kicking, sliding, and blocking adds an element of danger to the game. You need to dance to get the highest score possible, but dancing makes it so much easier to miss things. I also like the addition of checkpoints. Some may think it's unfair to the original, but with the new additions of the sequel, I welcome a mid-level checkpoint with open arms. I am glad that the decision was to put only one checkpoint per level, it would be too easy with more.   And the graphics. The graphics! Everything is so nice and soft like the art jumped into a bathtub full of cotton swabs, except the stick part was taken off and it's just a bathtub ful of the cottony parts of the swabs. I guess that would be a bathtub full of cottonballs... Regardless, everything is very smooth, and for the lovers of the original, there are some retro levels thrown in as well. The good friends character pack DLC also has some impressive graphics and animations, but that's a different review.  This game can and will be super challenging and frustrating as heck. You might find yourself replaying some of the levels hundreds of times. I know in my nearly three hours (one playthrough, mind you), I only made it through a handful of levels.

The graphics are great, it's a bit easy to learn each game mechanic because they're taught in separate levels. I chase after skins and new characters without ever giving up, because it's always a pleasure to find a new favorite skin. My current crush is the robot from the 4th world in a mariachi costume. Time goes pretty fast when I'm playing this game, and if that's not a good sign that I'm having fun despite the occasional rage I don't know what it is. There's something, however, that makes me want to give you one advice before you play this game: do not play the retro-styled levels. If you see a game cartridge, don't bother touching it or you're going to see the bad part of this game. Not only the difficulty is doubled, but for some reason, even though you can restart as many times as you like, you have 3 lives and no checkpoints for levels as long as the usual ones that do have them. What you get if you run out of lives? A game over screen with the worst noise I've ever heard in any video game I played so far. Just horrendous, really. These levels are already rage-inducing, but on top of that the game over screen is a punishment. Once you finally beat these devil levels, you get back into the good ones and I guess that makes you enjoy the main game a lot more. But at what cost?",
