            "review_text": "Remember the first time you parachuted into occupied (virtual) Normandy, France in the dead of night? Took out those German patrols stealthy-like? Created a distraction so your comrades-in-arms could take the beachhead and secure a landing site? Or remember being packed in an LCU (VIRTUAL), sea water and vomit sloshing beneath you; the Atlantic tossing you about like a plaything before your ship slammed into the beach? The ramp lowered, bullets chewed your men up around you; imposing, gray, gloomy skies contrasted that red, roiling surf? I sure as ♥♥♥♥ do. The developers of “Enemy Front” also remember. They remember and they want you to TOO.  It's been years since we've gotten a great WWII shooter. DAMN OUR HUBRIS. “Developers, we are SICK of killing Nazis. Come on, let's see something new,” we cried. “Okay, how about Nazi zombies?” they replied. And we were content for a time. But we wanted more. So they decided to drown the market in Tom Clancy Russian/Arab/Chinese right-wing wet dream masturbatory aid for the last SEVEN years. It's gotten more boring than WWII ever was. Because history is tangible. It happened. It happened to our grandparents. We can read books and watch documentaries and visit sites. It's real. It's powerful. Pretend future conflicts just aren't the same. They aren't bad, no! Just different. They don't have the same staying power. Remember my first paragraph? Bet you all remembered each of those moments vividly as I described them. Okay, now reflect on some of the latest modern shooter moments. OH ♥♥♥♥, REMEMBER THAT TIME YOU GOT NUKED? Yep. That was pretty heavy. WHAT ABOUT THE GHILLIE SUIT CHERNOBYL LEVEL?!? Oh yeah, that was excellent! Got anything else? No? Okay.  So I hope I've made my position in this debate clear. Now this WWII shooter might not be the savior we're looking for, but it's a fine first effort. The story is interesting, but Citizen Kane this is not. The characters are interesting but one note, underdeveloped, and underutilized. But this is to be expected from the genre. This isn't why we play WWII shooters though, is it? No. We play them to kick Nazi butt. So what little suffers from the weaker story elements the gameplay salvages.   You can approach a level in one of two ways: either come in Captain America style, rocking Nazi faces with your raw and unrelenting patriotism, or you can hit them Sam Fisher stealth style. This duality is very rewarding. The gunplay is great. I can feel the jolts up my arm; I feel the impact of each bullet, whether it's striking flesh or cover. I feel totally immersed. I'm a grimy, grizzled, Nazi-blood-hungry warrior – I'm not playing a video game in my underwear, hungry for day old pizza. The AI is serviceable. I'm playing on expert difficulty. They tend to rush in, unfortunately. Sometimes they display tactics, but on at least a few occasions I've taken a shot in an open area and fallen back, watching them funnel one by one into my death corridor. But otherwise they're competent – just don't expect “Brothers in Arms” tactics. The graphics are excellent, especially considering this is also a PS3 and Xbox 360 release. The ruined cities feel alive, buzzing and burning. The countryside is verdent and beautiful, still scarred by the brutality of war. And the sounds, last but not least, the sounds. Bullets whiz and ping, Germans shriek and shout orders, bombardments are heavy. The score is a little repetitive but it certainly is soaring and epic, fitting for the setting. If the gameplay makes this immersive, then the sound design is the icing on the cake.  A few gripes worth mentioning. I'm a resistance fighter. Thank God the Germans just left open ammo crates lying around everywhere otherwise, I don't know, I might have had to drop my weapon, change things up! And I'm tired of every European out of WWII speaking near perfect English. I wouldn't have minded subtitles; French speaking French, Polish speaking Polish. Finally, the game touts open worldness as a feature and pressures you to explore. I wish there were some collectables... propoganda leaflets and art, love notes and correspondence. History. An unfortunate missed opportunity.   So for my fellow history buffs and historical war enthusiasts AND EVEN A FEW OF YOU MODERN FANATICS, I think you'll have a good time with this game. It has serious nostalgia potential. You will likely smile and reflect on your time with this game when you're finally finished playing. For thirty bucks this is well worth your time. This is almost AAA quality. You owe it to yourself to give it a try.  Now go liberate (VIRTUAL) Europe.",

            "review_text": "I started Enemy Front right after finishing Wolfenstein New Order and perhaps this set my expectations a bit higher than it would have normally.  It's built with CryEngine and graphically looks good (my opinion from the 30 minutes I played) and goes downhill from there pretty quick. Cutscene video quality isn't great and crashed the game the first time I watched the opening video.  Its starts with a chaotic gun battle and making out where the targets are was quite difficult and not much fun. Suddenly off to a sewer to meet up with the resistance group and start your first mission. Here you get to choose between a sniping weapon or a machine gun. I chose the Kar98.  At this point I was hoping the gameplay would become a bit more interesting, but it didn't.  Problems: 1. Targets pop out like target signs and shooting feels a lot like the tutorials in COD  2. Hitting the target you aimed at seems random. You have an enemy in your sites, pull the trigger and ... you miss ... more often than not 3. The last straw for me was breaching the door to rescue the priest, going into slo-mo, targetting the enemy with the gun to the priests head, pull the trigger and ... miss ... enemy kills priest ... restart level  Uninstalled.  Enemy Front isn't fun. It's a popup target shooting game with random chances of hitting the target that isn't immesive or interesting.  Can it be fixed? I don't know. If they reworked the entire enemy and shooting system it could be redeemed but in it's presnt format, I suggest you spend your money on something else. ",

            "review_text": "Enemy Front is a WW2 shooter with an original setting and decent story: sadly a few issues and unimpressive production value keep it from being truly great.  Pros:  -novel setting,you join the Polish resistance and fight in Poland,France and Norway  -interesting story  -nice graphics thanks to CryEngine 3  -good sound design  -nice amount of different guns to use  -good variety of levels  -optional objectives during missions make things a little more interesting,also collectibles for those so inclined  Cons:  -cutscenes are somewhat low res  -movement feels a bit jerky at times  -poor enemy AI,while mostly functional it often just charges in the open,stops moving or doesn't react to casualties  -no lean/cover mechanics mar gunplay a bit  -while the story is interesting it falls flat in truly giving an emotional attachment to characters  -a few bugs here and there  -multiplayer is dead  I got this game for 4 dollars,and for the price it was a pretty interesting and fun ride.   It can be clearly seen Enemy Front is a product of love,sadly it didn't come out as great as it'd be,whether to a lack of budget or lack of testing I cannot say...but considering the lack of WW2 shooters and the fact it can still offer a decent 6 hour campaign I'd say it's a good purchase on sale for WW2 aficionados.",

            "review_text": "Many people have a problem with this game being buggy.   Truth be told , the only bugs are the game would crash while loading a new level every 3-4 levels or so , and sometimes when you start shooting a guy while he is speaking your gun will sound muffled. Doesn't seem that horrible right? Come to think of it - many games that have waaay more bugs and glitches have 'very positive' reviews. You are probably thinking 'well those games make up for it in terms of story and gameplay' and you might be right to an extend , but this game isnt that bad in terms of either story or gameplay to warrant such vigorous bashing. Sure , its a run-off-the-mill FPS , but story wise its not worse than the worse (lets say) COD games. Gameplay is a hit and miss , with mechanics from different games slapped together , you can feel the strong Wolfenstein influence , the stealth just straight up tore a page from Wolfensteins book . Shooting is OK-ish , where the game shines , and the reason I have continued to play it are the achievements and secondary objectives. Oh , this is also made in CryEngine so graphics are pretty nice , if you dont count the low res ground textures they used for some reason.   Bottom line - Nice game to get on sale or in a bundle. Campaign isnt all that long (certainly longer than most AAA FPS games these days tho) but offers quite a few additional challenges if you are into that kind of thing.",

            "review_text": "After finishing the single player campaign, including the DLC I've come to the point that I feel like rewriting my prior review. In my first review I was rather negative about this game; 'Enemey Front'. Many things stated on the store page did not show up in the game at all or showed up in a tamed down version.  But, as it may be, things did turn out to be pretty good after all. I mean, at first you might feel a bit ripped off, because there're no really vast open maps/levels. Combat is not always to your liking. Many things, if not all, are scripted, etc. Although the game is different than stated in the description, Enemy Front does provide a solid gaming experience and a nice story to connect the different missions.  The gameplay, controls, speed and reaction to input are all as you might expect from a CryEngine based game. They're top nodge. And many of the problems some users reported I didn't experience. In order to get the most out of this game you should run it on DX11 though and on max settings. This makes sure that the game looks like the screenshots. Okay, a bit less polished, but in the thick of a fight you don't really care if there're 50 shrapnel parts flying around or just 45.  The sound in this game is very good. The weapons have a nice sound and the dialogs, especially the German ones are even better than the Call of Duty counter parts. They're even more interesting.  Bugs.., The only bug I encountered once was a bug with the TNT/Dynamaite charge. After placing it I couldn't walk away. Providing my own Jihad experience. Besides of that anything during the game went pretty smooth.  Multiplayer can be a bit of a hassle though, many perople report connection problems or strange lag jolts and things like that. But, with the just provided dedicated server things might have changed. I haven't tested it yet, so I don't know.  My final verdict for Enemy Front is: 'A solid gaming experience'. It might be a bit overpriced, but if you're in to WWII games, then it's not that big of a deal.",

            "review_text": "Played some of this game, and, after a week or so, decided to uninstall it for the time being. At many points in the game, I found myself up in front of an enemy. I would unload an entire MP magazine at his face and no X marks showing up on the crosshairs to indicate any hits were taken by him. As a result, I died. Quite a few times, actually.  ***Spoiler Alert***  On the bonus mission for pre-ordering the game, there is a point in which you have to electricute the Germans coming into a lower level that has been flooded. I flipped the switch on one German, then flipped it again to make sure the water was not electrified. The other two Germans started shooting at me, and of course I returned fire with zero results. I ran across the water and, once again, unloaded my weapon on the both of them, and neither took damage. I died, again. This tells me that I have no choice BUT to electricute all of them, or I probably would not survive to continue. I must march to the beat of the game's drum.  It's things like this that really ruined my experience, especially after spending $30. On the bright side, it was just $30 and not the averate $50 or $60 that many games are going for these days.   At this current time, I would strongly recommend against purchasing this game. At least, see if any more updates come out and read future reviews to get a better idea on how the game has improved- if it has. I only spent about 3 hours on this game, and that's all I needed to make an educated descision.",

            "review_text": "In the main mission you are an american reporter fighting with the resistance against the nazis doing different missions and end up helping them throughout the whole game. Not the best WWII game I ever played but it was nice with a game that came out with newer graphics.   Things I liked:  -The things that I liked was the gun sounds, they were actually amazing on almost every gun you would shoot (probably the best WWII gun sounds in any game to date) -You can grab hostages and use them as a shield and still use your pistol to shoot other enemies and then just kill the hostage -Counter knife was pretty cool and decent and had a couple different animations for it - The blood squirt when you shoot an enemy and if you shoot them in the neck they grab their neck for a little animation and then fall over and die - How you can stealth or just run and gun - Varies things you can shoot to make objects fall on enemies or release debris from trucks that makes them move and crush enemies or makes a distraction - You can run and slide by hitting the crouch button - Map detailing was pretty good and a lot of different buildings you could go into and routes for the most part -They didnt r.a.p.e you for the money ($30) and I have played $60 games that were a lot worst and shorter.  Things I didnt like: - The movement of your character felt sluggish and slow but i eventually got used to it and didnt really notice it after a few hours of playing - Wish there was more guns, I understand your fighting with the russian resistance fighters and only have access to russian guns and german guns but the welrod and the 1911 was in the game but I was hoping to see the thompson, B.A.R springfield and the browning. ( The thompson and Garant you can use in a dlc mission I believe i got from preorder, which you are a different character and different mission).Theres only been a few games that had all those american guns and got them right  Conclusion:  All in all the negatives werent that negative but as WWII FPS games are my fav type of game and was glad to see one come out with updated graphics and such. The main mission took me about 10 hrs to complete with taking time stealthing some missions and running and gunning some. The dlc map took about 30 minutes to run and gun. A couple of aspects like the sniping when the camera follows the bullet to the enemy was like sniper ghost warrior but that didnt bother me, I actually enjoyed that. As for the MP part of the game I cant comment because Im not a MP type of player. I play games for the SP stories. As for it being $30 the game is well worth it to me because I understand how long it takes to make a game and to get everything right since I used to make custom maps for COD WAW and the SP mission was longer than I expected. Hope to see more DLC missions with some more american guns and I would rate this game 1 point higher.  I would rate this game a 7.5 to a 8 out of 10 and would recommend it if you like WWII FPS games  By the way dont ever listen to popular gaming sites or critic reviewers because they are rarely right about games and most are usually paid by other gaming companies to say bad things about a game. Best bet is to listen to reviewers on here or from some forums. Good luck and hope this helps.",

            "review_text": "Firstly, Enemy Front is SP only game like almost all of the CI stuff. They did a lot lot of cheap realises. MP is dead, so dont buy this game if you are not SP-player.  Enemy Fornt is a better version of Mortyr. This series is about commando who takes part in special/partizan operation during WW2. Probably nobody know this game, exept Poles. Motyr has only SP campain, no MP.  And now CI games realised abroad a better version of Mortyr - Enemy Front, calling it 'great game wow, next Crisis'. They always describe like that. Cheap games witch you can buy in newsagence for 4$ too. But non-Poles didnt know about it, they expected good MP and CoD's style SP. But Enemy Front is like Mortyr - you are one men army killing hordes of Germans. So that game is big disappointment for people who trust CI that they will made game of the year.  The main disadvantage of EF is bug and crash fest. You've got to preapare that 50% of map loading get stuck. Another bad aspect of game is that soldier's equpment is unhistorrical. You can find Stg-44, Sten Mk2 ,Panzerfaust or Germans wearing camo pants in 1940. Wz-35 AT Rifle has 5 round mag but in real life it has 4 bullets. Also German SMG-gunner skin is a diseaster - hakenkreutz on arm suggest Hitler's guard. But on helmet you can see Wehrmacht signs. Any way on the uniform you can see sign of artillery but also tankcrew one...  Some people complain about graphics. It just OK, not the best, not the worst. Also players complain about stupid AI. AI is copy-paste from one used in Mortyr: Operation Thunderstorm, Terrorist Takedown 2, Code of Honor 2 and games like that. So prepeare that German soldiers act like Afgani partisans in MOH: Tier 1.   But this game has also good sides. Firs one is really beautiful presentation of buildings in Warsaw like Pasta or Saint Cross Church. Next possitive aspect of game is that you can find weapons like Weltrod, DeLise, Browning Wz-28 or Lightning SMG. They are not present in common FPS serieses.   And why to but this game? Campain. It isnt difficult but long enough. I really enjoyed my time playing it. You can take part in historical battles in Poland, year 1944 and fictional ones in France , Norway and V2 complex. This deffinitly good game for people who like Rambo-style playing, like me.  I will mark it like in school: 3+/6",

First off being Polish and quite a bit of a WW2 buff I thought it would be great to see this shooter based on (mostly) the Warsaw Uprising. I didn't expect all that much as they gave just arrived quietly and hit me like a brick on front page of steam. Instead of writing a page and a half of what I think I will just list pros and cons so people can decide whether the pros outweigh the cons as it is a matter of preference. PROS: - deadly storyline, makes you feel like you take part in the uprising and also previous memories from France, Norway are intertwined making for some cool breaks. - good graphics (not every game has to look like crysis guys but still decent imho) - native support for surround resolutions - cool weapon choice  CONS: - SHIIIIIIT AI, needs patching up before I could really recommend it to anyone - some buggy terrain, not awful but makes for few annoying moments - small bugs like for example character standing up after a reload and getting headshot ;-( - short 4-5 hour long campaign (too short for game thats not MP oriented) - mediocre MP, not bad but not good either  Overall if you can get it on sale after it is patched you will enjoy it - in present stage post release AI is just a deal breaker !!!

            "review_text": "First impression 4 hours into single player campaign:   Enemy Front is a fun game, though there are a few mildly annoying bugs - some objects are missing textures (fireplace, door), A.I. is not especially challenging, and (most important of all) the environment is -not- destructible (with a few exceptions). A big plus for not using quick-time events at all!   Some replay value as you can either be stealthy or storm around shooting up everything, and you can manipulate certain objects to create traps (for example - in one level, you kill a group of enemies by dropping a bunch of treetrunks on their heads, and in another mission by rolling a truck into an enemy camp, and kiling them when the truck hits another truck and explodes). You can also use an enemy soldier as a 'meat shield', by holding him hostage at gunpoint while shooting his friends.  Also included are some entertaining features usually seen in 'Sniper Elite', such as bulletcam under certain circumstances (when sniping, for instance) and the whole 'shooting by cover of a loud noise so as not to be discovered'-thing.   The story and voice are also pretty decent, and the game certainly delivers in the 'nice graphics' and 'ooh, shiny'-department. The controls feel a bit like 'Medal of Honor: Airborne' to me. Not perfect, but close enough.  Some people have reported performance issues, but I haven't encountered any (I run with all settings on highest on a mid-range gaming rig). The game has crashed once during the first four hours of gaming.  Look, if you like WW2 FPS, you just might enjoy Enemy Front. I'm having a blast!  (Note: I haven't tried multiplayer at all - MP is not really my thing.)",

            "review_text": "This game is a lot of fun! There are a few pros and a few cons on this game, as is the way with all games. So I will just point them out quickly.  Pros:  1) Intuitive and easy gameplay: You start off in the thick of action and you can immediately start performing as if youre a veteran in the game  2) Character mechanics: Your character is very easy to operate. If you hit 'crouch' while running you do a slide. I didnt need to be told that. I did it on my own within the first few seconds of the game. But you will notice that you need very little instruction and your cdharacter is so easy to navigate through the worlds  3) Cryengine: The graphics are not as good as I expected (more on that later) but Cryengine has great psyhics. And Enemy Front does well in making the most of the engine in this category  4) Choice: Each section of each level has multiple ways to approach it. For example, you need to hold point at the Church. There are two different missions and tactics that you can choose from to achieve this. No matter which you choose you will find side objectives and you can complete the mission stealth or guns blazing or a little of both. I try to sneak through the hard parts and go bezerk on areas where there are only a few enemies.  5) Hit detection system: This is a simple tweak thast makes so much sense. When you shoot an enemy a white 'X' means youre hitting them and when you get a red 'X' that means the enemy is dead. It makes the FPS environment so much easier and also helps you realize who needs extra bullets and who doesnt. Very cool.  6) Price: I got this on sale for $23. Normal price is $30. Its worth it. I actually thought this would be ideal at a regualr price of $25 and you will see why in the cons  7) Gun Mechanics: The guns are fairly easy to operate. There is recoil but much like a lot of FPS's its sort of put in there just to give the feel of authenticity. But because this game has so many scenes with a lot of action I am glad they didnt spend a lot of time getting the guns to operate true to their real life specs. It wouldve made the game way too hard for most.   There are other pros but those are the first that come to mind.  Now the cons. There arent many and they shouldnt stop you from playing the game. But there are sort of weird, quirky, and unexplainable. They dont bother me but they may drive someone nuts. (Usually CoD fans are very particular about other games but havent realized yet that CoD sucks)  Cons:  1) Stupid, poor quality cut scenes: I've noticed with Crysis series too that cut scenes are not high quality. Which is annoying because youre playing in this super detailed environment and then in between levels you get a back-story that looks like it was made on BetaMax. Not sure why Cryengine games are structured this way. Here we have the bad cut scenes and they have used a 3d still image that the camera pans around while loading a level. Since that image is just as fuzzy as the cut scenes, it is an eye sore and pretty annoying. I wouldve rather had a black screen with a 'Loading' progress bar. Btw, cut scenes are so low quality that my framerate goes up to 4,000 frames per second and stays there.  2) Graphics Quality: I always start games with everything maxed out. And then if it is too heavy on resources I start to back certain settings off. Here, I am still maxed and the graphics are not as good as I expected. Some of the textures look unfinished, especially at shallow angles. Certain foliage (and frequently so) have this sort of 1 dimensional Super Mario Bros 3 look and feel. Since the levels are very linear you would think that the player's path would be the cleanest. Ironically its not. Its actually all of the objects taht are out of where you can travel that seem to be flawless (and finished)  3) Graphics Settings (or lack there of): One thing I usually kill shorlty after testing a game is post-processing effects. Here, post-processing can not be turned off but only turned down to 'Low'. Gamma never feels right no matter how its set.  3.5) For some reason, any adjustments I make in-game remove the color profile I have set up in windows for my monitor. Anyone with an ASUS monitor knows that having a modified color profile is necessary for proper look and feel. After any adjustments this triggers the profile to be deactivated.  4) Rock Throwing/Aiming: This game plays a lot like Sniper Elite V2. You can even throw a rock to distract an enemy. However, where you throw it is much higher than your cross hairs. So its very hard to aim where you are throwing it. Too many times I tried to throw it away from me to get a guy to walk away. But rather I would hit the ceiling or something right in front of me and the enemy would see me. So, for some reason, you have aim almost at the ground when throwing a rock (and grenades) in order to get a good proper throw away from you.  5) GPU Usage: For some reason this will really put my 290 right up to 100% and stay there. Thats just very odd because there are so many games that have much better graphics that do not do this. And when I say it goes to 100% I mean for everything...core clock, memory clock, et al.  And thats about it. Im sure there is more but I am just writing this off the top of my head. I have not tried Multiplayer yet and I may never try it. I save Multi for games like Insurgency and dont care too much for games that are supposed to be single-player and have a multi option. They are hardly ever done right or worth my time to play. But If you like FPS and WW2 you should be buying this game",

Single Player:  The campaign starts off slow, bland and a little boring, but once you get to the flashback levels, the scenery really starts to pop, and it's full of lush colours and beautiful landscapes. The visual style is colourful, something you don't often see in WW2 games, and is a very welcome change.   The music is nice, and at some points beautiful. Weapon sounds are crisp and punchy, and the dialogue from the German enemies is great - and sometimes frightening (there's a certain line that Officers say that is downright scary when you hear it coming from around the corner). Voice acting from the main characters is a little off though, and lacks some charisma.  The story is okay, but lacks real punch, and you find yourself not really caring about the characters much - even though you may sympathise with the WW2 victims.   Weapons and gameplay is a mixed bag. This game is certainly not OPEN WORLD like they claim. I have yet to find any evidence of open world gameplay. There are a couple of instances where you can make a MULTIPLE CHOICE in the path you wish to take through the level, but that's it. Sometimes you will choose the stealth option, only to have the game force you to breach a door and start a massive firefight. Sniping is FUN, especially when you get a great shot and it goes into bullet-cam. Overall, the gameplay can be described as a generic FPS with ocassional basic stealth.   Multiplayer:  First of all, there are only 4 maps. Secondly, only a handful of servers. Third, I could not connect to ANY of these servers except one (I couldn't join, and the ones I could join disconnected me before the match even begun - yes, even the dedicated servers). When I finally got into ONE server, I (and many others it would seem from the player list) had extreme lag and ping levels in the red.   Multiplayer NEEDS more content and more polish! Add at least another 4 maps, add BOTS if you aren't going to support international players, add some kind of progression or ranking system with unlocks to keep players coming back for more!  Fix fix fix multiplayer, and you could have a great game and capture a loyal WW2 crowd.   Many people have purchased this with hope, so take the time and address the concerns of players now. They would love to have a good game to keep coming back to over and over, both in single player and especially multi player.",

            "review_text": "Enemy Front is a curious game in the FPS universe: being a low budget WWII game running on the famous CryEngine one would not really know what to expect. Truth is, while Enemy Front does not fully explore its untapped potential, it still provides a most enjoyable ride.  To begin with: graphics are good, really good. It truly creates a captivating atmosphere. Be warned, however: the game is poorly optimised, and thus framerate drops may be recurrent.  Regarding sound, Music is absolutely fantastic. It has got a remarkable OST that will remain with you long after ending a mission. Voice acting, however, is somewhat lacklustre, and weapon sounds just feel bland.  Now, on to gameplay:   Shooting works just fine, but I do have a minor complaint to make: weapons lack a certain 'oomph' to it when fired. Maybe removing that ugly cross that pops up whenever you hit a target just to let you know you landed a shot would allow you to savour the moment all the more.  Melee is, truth be told, absolutely disgusting. You get to an enemy up front, give him hell with the stock of your rifle and he will just fall sluggishly on his back, as if slowly falling asleep or something. That, and the lack of some powerful sound when meleeing them makes for some appaling close quarters. This might just be the worst thing about the game. Truly, I end up shooting everyone I am about to melee, just to spare myself of the despicable sight of enemies falling to their dreams - yup, you read that right.  Stealth, however, works like charm, and that's something I didn't expect from this game. It's not like it's a major feature or anything, but the game's designed in such a way that you can play each and every level either up front or sneaking your way behind the enemy lines - or a mixture, for that matter. This makes for multiple ways to tackle an enemy stronghold, a mission or the entire game itself for that matter. You can stealth kill enemies from behind or even take them hostages to use either as meat shield or to silently get rid of them somewhere else. And you know what? You can even pick up bodies and throw them wherever you choose, so as to avoid detection by your enemies. A GREAT feature that should exist in all games.  Enemy Front delivers an enjoyable and unique experience in the genre. It has some rough edges, but you shouldn't let that mar your experience.  For 29.99, I deem this a 4/5. Excellent game.",

While the visuals are nice (but not excellent by comparison to any other modern shooter), the gameplay is clunky, movement feels sluggish, and the entire game feels generally unfinished. While there is a campaign, and a story that goes along with it, it holds no narrative depth whatsoever. I can see what the developers were trying to do - follow the character development of a news reporter who turns from someone exploiting the resistence movement for a good story to a freedom fighting partisan, and that's a good idea on paper. But in practice, there isn't much more than a few pre-rendered cutscenes that do little more than superficially show this hasty development.  To the games credit, it tries its best not to remain boring, or stay in one place for too long. The story shifts all around the WWII theatre, with missions taking place in France, Poland and other key areas of the war. There is always ammunition and explosives lying around to play with, and a focus on stealth to dispatch enemies quietly (with a pretty good hostage-taking system to get around areas peacefully, or just have a human shield to soak up bullets). But the flaw in Enemy Front is that it is too linear for the ideas it wishes to convey. There are no character upgrades, or special perks that can be looked forward to down the line. Apart from a few collectable Reich insignias (which do nothing), there is no reward for exploring or any incentive to replay the campaign. Despite the focus on stealth, the system is unclear and just not very fun to use.  I haven't had any luck with the multiplayer, as any matches that I actually managed to connect to (3 out of 35) were unpopulated, or suffered drop-outs within seconds. If a future patch fixes this, I'll be sure to correct this.   I really want to like this game, because WWII shooters have a massive place in my heart, especially the original Call Of Duty and Medal of Honor games. While Enemy Front appears to cater to my nostalgia at certain points, it raises the question: If throwing-back to the first shooter games is all Enemy Front can offer, why shouldn't I just play the old games instead of this one? I noticed on the menu that there is a 'DLC' page, which suggests more to come for the series, or just for this game. While a more intriguing storyline would be interesting, I fear that the focus will be on the already broken multiplayer, leaving the future of Enemy Front to be forever at the bottom of the Steam Bargain Bin, with it's worth on par with a trading card. It is a shame that such a great idea has been so poorly excecuted.  4/10 - Forgettable, broken, and not fun at all.",

First of all I hate to look at all the clips in the begining before the game startes.. you know the makers and engines and stuff.. ill press esc as a mad man to make them go away :P  So there i was in the begining menu of the game.. and damn that menu was so freaking promising and good. and the short video load screens are awesome.  so when i started the singel player mission i was xcited. and beeing from norway and kneew that norwegian maps would be added i couldent wait for that story line to happen.   when playing it was mixed feeling. a feeling between playing COD UO and call of juarez .- im not dissapointed about the 'enemy' but there where some bugs here and there that realy shooked me sinse i had so great hopes for this game.. ive posted 2 screenshots from this on my profil.. flying in the air books and a enemy ghost inside a wall ..   all that beside i still loved moving around and shooting stuff. but when i got to the point where i had found a silencer weapon and i could realy stealth it.. i was so frustrated when i came to a checkpoint and lost thoose weapons .. wtf.. let me keep them :(  afther that point all the negativities started to infeltrate my head.  like missions could go on and on and on and on if you dident do what was xpected to do even though it was all over.  i got like strange missions and couldent quite make them work as i think the plans for it was.   sometimes you had to rush like hell for not been randomly killed at that point and sometimes if you rushed the ai player got stucked or bugged.   i remember one of the landscapes.. city like.. i feelt like my character was a dwarf at some point.. not that its something wrong with that. but i think they mad some bad judgement in some of the layout.   so ive finnishd the singelplayer mission.. done some multyplayer action..   and i came to the conqlution that yes you could buy the game if you whant it and are a fan of ww2 games etc.  but dont xpect to much of it. its not a 100/100 game if i could rate it.. it would be a 55/100  I had fun playing it. hoped it would be better but maybe next time :)",

Unless you have a nazi-killing fetish, don't bother.  1 cool thing about it that I (&amp; everyone who wasted their time) ought to remember: during the stealth gameplay, you could make noise when bombs were being dropped as that sound covered the player's actions.

This is a shame for the developers.. - Character animations are bad, the lip sync of friendly NPCs is bad, the priest from the church had some weird body movements and the soldiers in the sewers sometimes got stuck in a endless phantom fast moving loop. I bet this game was made by a single person in his parent's garage.. - The weapons are meh.. clunky sights, weird hitmarks that remind me of disabled objects pointer, very weird choices from the developer. - I am sorry but i do not believe this game is made with cryengine, i played Crysis 3 and the only similarity is the tiredness to the eye. I only played a two missions and i think this game could have been awesome in the 2008-2009 but in the 2013-2014-2015 is just a bad overpriced joke. Don't buy it - there are plenty better choices at better money.  ",

It's strange because there is some genuine fun to be had here but the game is just too inconsistent. Sometimes the game is gorgeous, other times it is downright ugly. Other times the gun play seems fun, then it becomes a frustrating bullet hose fest. I got about 3/4's way into the game when all of a sudden i started getting a slow mo bullet cam effect when using the sniper rifle that I had never seen before. While cool it certainly came out of nowhere, things like this seem to crop up all the time. The plot, characters and story can never seem to make up their mind whether they want to be serious (saving private ryan) or serious camp (original COD, those 60's WW2 movies).  Long story short should you buy this game? I would say if you can get it for $5 and have a free evening to play it (it's short) then it might be worth your time. The setting is interesting, if not wholly unique, and there is a speck of a good game in here somewhere. Treat it like a cheap rainy day B Movie and have some fun but otherwise stay away.  5/10",

If you get it on sale and don’t mind linear missions like the original call of duty, then I think it is worth a play through (don’t even consider multiplayer, it’s dead). The graphics are pretty good, I like the slow-motion looking loading screen, which is good, because the game takes a long time to load. Check points are poorly done, and some missions, you have to figure out what they want you to do or you will lose a few times.   Example, one mission, you are tasked with defending a point. Germans will send waves of infantry, halftracks, and a couple of tanks. You have limited ammo. The first time I played, I used my rocket launcher and grenades freely and found that, even though I had killed all the Germans, and defeated all the waves, I could not win because I could not destroy the remaining half-track (even though I could walk around it freely) because I had run out of explosive ammo.  I did like the story line. Being a part of the Polish resistance in Warsaw was quite effective at bringing the “War is Hell” feeling to the game. When the Germans shoot civilians, you find you want to take them out with more emotions than most games of this genre. The radio broadcasts “This is Warsaw calling all free nations” becomes almost haunting by games end.  Get it cheap, play on the hardest level (the rest are too easy), and a few entertaining hours are to be had. ",

The levels are boring and the game can be pretty repetitive but It is fun to play it at least once, It's not Medal of Honor Allied Assault, It's not Brothers In Arms, It's not Battlefield 1942, It's not Return to Castle Wolfenstein, It's not even close to Call of Duty World At War which was an okay game, not as good as the first and second Call of Duty games but it was a good game and a better game than this one (in some aspects), this game also has its good points, stuff that Call of Duty does not have.
