            "review_text": "This game is simple to pick up, pretty to look at, and has a *ton* of frantic action. What really makes the gameplay for me is the ability to grab thrown items out of the air, and throw 'em back at your opponent!  Playing the single player against the AI is definitely a lot of fun, but this is one of the first multiplayer games that's *really* made me want a 2nd Vive so I could play this with guests!  I'm *definitely* going to be showing this game to a lot of the people I demo the Vive for.  One complaint: When I looked at the multiplayer games, there were at least 2 pages of populated games, but since it's all 2 player, they were all full. I spent 2 sessions of maybe 2-4 minutes hosting a game and waiting for others to join, but no luck so far.  The enviornment while waiting for another player to join looks pretty cool and all (it looks like how I imagine 'Harvest Moon' would look like in VR, which is kinda awesome), but there's nothing to keep you occupied while you wait for a game to begin.  If it was possible to play a game against the AI while waiting for a human opponent to join (and maybe have that be the 'default' gameplay option shown at the top of the game type menu), I think that would go a loonng way towards keeping this game's multiplayer populated.",
