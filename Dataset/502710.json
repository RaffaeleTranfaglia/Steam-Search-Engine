            "review_text": "It's okay. Do I recommend it, I guess if you think its worth the money. The fact that it takes two shots to kill anyone, with the exception of a headshot makes it feel almost arcadey. It would be improved if it was one shot to the upper torso as aiming in VR is difficult on its own.   The only proper way to hold the rifle without having to reach over and actuate the bolt is to hold it in your left hand and fire with your left, which is super awkward. Is it a neat idea? Certainly. But I think it should have gone a bit more realistic rather than arcady when it comes to shooting the enemies.   The normandy beach map just isn't fun because you're spraying what is effectively a blunderbuss mixed with an MG42, good luck hitting anything reliably. When you do hit someone, they take 2-3 hits to finally die so it makes it a very annoying game mechanic.",

Also I get the feeling the dev seems to be confused on if this is arcade or realistic.  Pros. World war 2 shooter. Loading weapon Jumping from plane  Cons. Every shot is a tracer bullet( looks more like a laser bullet)? Damage with bullets would be better More chance hitting targets with rifle at arms distance. Very very short. Not much replay value Do we really need to be spun when jumping from plane Buggy - example enemy just stopped coming out.  Look there are a few other things on my con list but I'm not here to bag the dev just give my review.  Will I refund this game? Yes. Look if the dev had early access I wouldn't but a buggy, short and hard to play mechanics is just not what I was after. And saying I played it all so I shouldn't refund, come on it took me less than 20mins to complete.   ",

            "review_text": "Good game, worth the buy. The weapons have a good feel to them: accurate sights, reasonable reload (for the intensity of the game, I really wouldn't want an overly complicated reload like HHHG, especially not on rush), and fair spray. The dev is very responsive to bugs/comments/questions. Although it's titled 'the last sniper', there's a nice variety to the gameplay and weapons used.",

            "review_text": "As for VR gaming I wasn't hoping it to be a COD quality game but there is no way I can call it a good game. The idea of manually pulling the lever to reload is good but the mechanic doesnt work very well, sometimes it just doesnt pull. I think the worst part is to shoot a target 20 meters away with a long-distance scope. It doesn't work like this, neither in game nor in real life. Hard to aim and feel very strange. The machineguns have terrible accuracy. It is supposed to create a feeling of realistic shooting but having a spread of 5 meter at 100 meter distance is over the top. Seriously one can do much better than that in reallife archery. If the gun is that crap D-Day would be a cake walk but history says no.  ",
