            "review_text": "If you're looking for a good match 3 game, League of Mermaids has you covered. The game contains an incredible number of match 3 boards, getting increasingly more difficult as you proceed in the story. What I really like here is that the boards are not on a grid, instead they take several forms ranging from your basic 'ball pit' to free floating boards in space that require strategic dropping to solve them completely.  The story is forgettable, told by static images. A mermaid has lost treasures which means the world will be destroyed, so she has to solve match 3 puzzles to get them back. Each stage contains 15 boards, and you return a treasure after every 5th board.  The match 3 puzzles can be solved relatively easily, even the difficult ones, but to get a 3 star rating on each board you do not only need to solve it (1st star), but also solve it before the time limit (2nd star) and also match an additonal challenge for the 3rd star. This is where the difficulty comes in, since it usually requires you to match three specific gems which are scattered across the board before the rest of the board is solved.  This added complexity of trying to get all three stars is what makes the game fun and challenging, and keeps me returning to it. I've already spent multiple hours trying to perfect the boards, and will probably sink in a lot more in this fun game.  If you're still not sure what this game is like, think of a cross between Bubble Bobble, Peggle, and a basic match 3 game. Add some relaxing music and cute graphics, and you have League of Mermaids.",

The artwork and music are so sophisticaed and relaxing, plus the unknown that comes with Flash gravity type games makes it the right amount of challenging. You must try it!",
