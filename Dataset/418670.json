            "review_text": "lovely art style, beautiful music, simple, but effective gameplay. The control are responsive, which is so important in these games. The characters are charming. There is a beautiful menu screen, including a map area. From what i can see, there are also collectibles. You gain different powers as you progress. Been playing for about an hour, and definitely love where this game is going. If you enjoy light hearted platformers, with charm and a nostalgic 90s feel- you can't go wrong with this. And at the price, its a steal. Just remember, there are two episodes. Currently only one is available.",
