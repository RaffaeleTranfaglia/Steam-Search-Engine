A clear example why the comunist sytem failed.;P after some levels u get promoted to italy campaing and then you have to follow some one that isnt there a german convoy is stuck in the sand u can kill them all easily as they stay in the truck, then when u close in to investigate u see the hand clicking f puts u inside the truck that doesnt move , and when u exite the truck u sudenly see ure own head from behind with ure own rifle aiming at it ( see my uploadedpic) how could this ever be realeased in russia? probably paid out of some ww2 memorial fund, no one took time to check or play beyond the second level? Wierd. If u fix the small bugs there is a great game now its unplayable! Be a man and refund or repair, rusian honor is at stake. :P",
