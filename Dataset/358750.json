            "review_text": "Reviewer backstory: I had first come upon the Sunrider series back when the first game was just recently released on Steam. I had instantly become enamored when I first finished and was excited to see more as I became interested in all the characters. (Solamancer btw) After MoA and Academy I was excited for this game Liberation day, it had sent me into Mass Effect 3 frenzy all over again. I became a Patreon supporter so that I could get Beta access and have a copy of the game reserved at launch!   Game Review: Ver1 was a bitter experience for myself. This mediocre version of the game had completely neglected the story and its paltry choices left me dumbfounded. While the gameplay by itself was well done and the Japanese voice acting was impressive, that too was hampered by slowdown from the new game engine. A final note is that I am one of those who run through on waifu mode because I'm more interested in the story aspects which Ver1 stumbled on at the end with a seemingly fatalistic ending and railroaded relationship with your science officer.  Ver2 largely retained the gameplay features with a few bug fixes but its main contribution was the addition of an epilogue to reintroduce choices into the game and to show that this was not your character's final act but simply a chapter closed and a new foe to face.  The DLC: I write this review after having played REborn and this was the best part of the game by far in terms of choices and story as it now allowed choices to create unique paths and reach new endings. The game would always encourage you to try again if you reached a bad ending or even aim higher if you reached the 'normal/alt' endings. It was worth a bad ending or two to figure out the secret to getting the good endings. (Thanks Wanderer!}  Sola love!  All in all it was a pleasant experience in the end. Here's to leaving Ver1 behind and seeing the future of this series!",

The game had so many issues at launch. Where were the choices? why didn't we have a star map anymore? why didn't we have a ship map anymore? What the heck was that ending supposed to be? Luckily, the Devs took note of these issues and the game's mixed reviews of about 50%. Now with the 2.0 patch, restoring missing content and fixing issues, the games has a positive score of about 70%. Amazing. but the game is nowhere near perfect, you can't simply patch out the main story, but Love in Space, unlike others, made an effort. So without further praise, it is my pleasure to announce my review of....    Sunrider: Liberation Day",

            "review_text": "First off, let me say I played Sunrider: Liberation Day Captain's Edition v3.0, so I did not experience much of the turbulance of the original release, for which I'm glad.  In general, I enjoyed Sunrider: Liberation Day. It is as challenging, if not more than Mask of Arcadius in its tactical challenges. Even working through on the lowest difficulty the weight of units described in the script are felt on the battlefield. Objectives become even more important than the Mask of Aradius, though they've thankfully done away with those infernal escort missions. Ryders and ships have become more specialized, offering a wider variety of tactical options and challenges. Some of those new units could have been introduced more slowly, but their addition enriched the Sunrider franchise's already exquisite tactical tapesty. The final battles of the game proved as nerve-wranking as the end of Mask of Aracadius, if for different reasons.   The main cast all received varying levels of character development, fleshing out their relationships in small ways that make the Sunrider feel more a large house than an battlecruiser/carrier. The improvement in voice acting played a part in this, for sure, but each major character in the Sunrider provide their own unique charm on and off the battlefield. The Japanese only audio may provide a barrier for some, but the option to switch English battle voices eases some of the discomfort.   The plot assumes that you have played, or are familiar with the First Arrival and Mask of Aradius, jumping right into the action and never really slowing down long enough to world build much beyond the occasional curiosity. While I would have liked more information about the Sunrider universe, I appreciate the series's continued tendency resist the plot fragmentation of other Visual Novels, leading to the need to construct/rely on choice guides to finish the game correctly. Frankly, the Sunrider games are hard enough without the mire of multiple routes. That being said, the choices made in first two games carry over and have small, but significant impacts on the game's plot and available upgrades and resources in Liberation Day.   Despite its brevity, I enjoyed the plot. The push toward Cera proves fraught unexpected difficulties aboard and away from the ship. The crew of Sunrider's cohension as a group and individual friendships are tested as political and military forces collide around them. The final arch of the game seems to spin out of control at first, but manages to land on a resounding, if somber note. While the romantic plot remains fixed on a single girl, I discovered I didn't mind that much. Too many Visual Novel leads are blank slates manipulated by player strings toward a particular partner. Shields breaks that mold and the narrative does better for it. His relationship with Chigara developed a reasonable pace and, by the end, their romance felt geniune. Even so, Sunrider is a harem Visual Novel, among other things. The other girls get their little bit of romantic screen time and if you pay close attention player romantic choices do play out in small ways that will no doubt bear fruit in later games. That being said, I've really only pursued Sola as a romantic partner XD  However, for those who enjoy exploring multiple narrative routes, the free dlc RE[TURN] does follow a more traditional Visual Novel format with no less than ten endings depending player choice. You do need to play through the main game once to get access though.  The game received a welcome upgrade to its visuals. The new artwork increased my enjoyment of the game while adding interesting visual plots cues. Though the improvements to Aracadius threw me off at first (enough to replay the first two games make sure their endings hadn't changed somehow). The loss of the unit animations are an unfortunate casualty.   In its present form, Sunrider: Liberation Day is a rough diamond half-buried in the sand. It may not look like much at first, but it rewards a dedicated gamer.",

            "review_text": "I'm going to split this review into two sections. First, for what came out on release day and second what came out in the V2.00 update.  V1.00:  I supported Liberation Day for a while prior to its release, so it should go without saying that I am biased in favour of this game. When it finally came out, I played it immediately and after completing V1.00 I was in a state of confused anticipation. The game plays out fairly slowly for the most part plot-wise, and then suddenly it all kicks off at the end! Such plot twists! Such action! Before I go on for ages about it, I'll summarise.  Pros: &gt;Music. The composer did a darn good job on this one, and at least three of these tracks are series favourites. I love a good tune, and this game has some. :D &gt;Gameplay. While some people miss the old combat animations, I think that Liberation Day runs much smoother without them, and means that missions don't drag on for an eternity. The inclusion of number keys for abilities also make it a lot easier to perform actions.  Cons: &gt;Price:Length. As stated in most of these reviews, the ratio was a bit too extreme at the start. Even I was looking at it warily after completion wondering if it would have been worth the purchase.  &gt;The route selection is practically done for you in V1. Not wanted, thank you very much. I'll choose my own waifus.   Ultimately it comes down to what you play it for. If, like me, you just wanted to find out what happens next, use the new battle mechanics etc., then I'd say go for it. If you're a little skeptical, then wait for a sale. This game is worth playing, but perhaps not at that price.  Such would my first review have gone, but then V2.00 came along...  I've just completed it and the difference is astronomical in the ending. As well as the restoration of the english voices in battle with new phrases and the ship and galaxy maps, a bucketload of new VN content was slapped onto the end. It improves the cliffhanger tenfold, provides a better resolution than the original, gives us the confessions we wanted all along and sets us up for a really interesting sequel. After completing this end, I was so much more hyped than the first time around.  Price-wise, version 1 was worth (in my opinion) £10-£12 with no reasonable objections. With the patch included, I'd say that has gone up to at least £15-£17 if not more, detracting considerably from the aforementioned 'con'. While it still doesn't quite match the asking price, it's a lot more justifiable for longtime fans. I for one cannot wait until we get the next game. With the fan reaction V1 had, I believe (and hope) that Samu-Kun has learned what the fans want the game for, and will progress with that in mind in the next title, so we won't have to go through this again ^.^  P.S. That vanguard cannon video. All of my yes! The new music for that sequence was one of my biggest early-on fears regarding Liberation Day, but they got it bang-on. And the tune is longer than 40 seconds this time!  I still love that cannon XD",

Original ending has been mostly fixed (It was added so fast, that it did most likely exist before original release. I cant understand why devs cut it out, time issues? or mayby it was attempt to create drama that backfired)  If you have not played previous episodes, dont jump in. This story simply wont work without that. You cant understad anyone (fast and slightly jumpy dialogue does not help much). I have been a fan for a long time and really love this series, including this one.  It is good game but hardly perfect.   Pros: +Excellent visuals, really loved them. +thumbs up for that. +Voice acting. I loved it, VAs did good job, even if Sola did sound ...off +Emotional rollecaster, some scenes were really emotional. (but you have to know lore and characters, if not... well I would be just confused.) +New ending left me wanting more.  Cons -fast and jumpy writing more scenes. Charcters reacted like rabbits on sugar rush. I understad theme: jealousy and love makes you crazy, but game was too short in order for this to feel real. I felt like reading a book after someone cut off everything 'not plot related'. PLEASE: add more content. Many charcters did hardly get any screentime. (Ie. Ava acted like really 'off', Asaga didnt make any sense at times.... ) -Linear. Not many choises. This was hardest for old time fan. It didnt feel like I was part of the story. More like outsider watching things go. -Too pricy for contet. I would pay around 12-15 bucks. (and I have am 20$ patron, have been from the start) -I cant help but to feel like game should have handeled Chigara differently. Feels too much like forced drama.(mayby sister(ish) thing... I dont know.) PLAYER SHOULD HAVE OPTION ABOUT THIS DAMMIT. She had least affection points in my game!  Anyway, would still recommed and want to see more. Come on devs! I KNOW you can do better!

Well this game lets you do that as you have your own ship the Sunrider and your own mechs to command called Ryders. You can even hire more ships to be added into your fleet from battleships to fighters. Its a really fun turn based game but where it really shines is the story. Half of the game is a turn based game and the other is a visual novel. The story has so many flips and turns that I dont want to spoil at all. If you are unsure of buying this game well dont, the game before this is free. So go play that and if you do like it then definitely get this one. Do not skip the first game though for this one, it will be more confusing and wont be as good. Also the first one is free so no excuse really for not playing it before.",

            "review_text": "Gameplay: This is a mix of a visual novel and turn based tactics / strategy (similar to Fire Emblem). I can't emphazise this enough: it's not just a VN, more than half of the game consist of the turn-based combat.   Difficulty: The difficulty of this game is very high, even though it may appeal as some generic VN. Everyone who was shocked by the previous game's difficulty can rest assured: the balancing is much better than in the previous one. You'll propably still die a lot during your first playthrough, but it never feels unfair.   Story (there will be a few spoilers but nothing critical): The game starts exactly where the last one ended. The story has two main aspects: one being the war against PACT to free Cera, another one being the search for a traitor. There are some obvious candidates for the traitor, but in the end I'm still not sure who actually betrayed whom. Either everyone betrayed everyone or no one betrayed anyone. Additionally there's a forced romance which is important to the story's end and propably also the start of the next game.    My review: Most people complain about the game's playtime and the forced romance in the story.   Regarding the playtime: when you're playing on medium difficulty you'll propably need around 10 hours. That people who rush through the game only need 5 hours or less is only natural. As I said in the beginning: this isn't just a VN, half of it is tactical battles. If miss half of the game it's self evident that you only need half the time to finish.  Regarding the forced romance: Personally I don't have a problem with the forced romance and neither with the choiceof character the devs made. The actual problem is the pacing of the game's story. I think it's just a few weeks of in-game time and because of that the romance feels very rushed and quite unnatural.   The short version of all this: the turn-based battles are challanging and for me even the main appeal of the game. The story has a small problem with it's pacing but is still very enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "There has been a lot of controversy about this game, but seeing how there are still a number of people reviewing it positively I blame much of it on the fact that crowdfunding raises expectations and likewise the disappointment if they are not fulfilled.   My experience may also differ here because I never played any of the betas, even though I had access to them via patreon. It does wonders for reducing hype.^^   Actually, a few more months of development would have done good, of course you can never prevent all glitches and it was more stable for me than the previous games. No idea at which patch, but I came across the series after Mask of Arcadius was already released.   My main gripe is the comparative linearity, though I can see why the development team felt that was necessary. But even if a certain plot thread had to be linear, there were other ways to accomplish much the same emotional impact and retain many of the conversations (this is a considerable cost factor) while giving the player more freedom than this had, though there some scenes I have not seen, judging by the empty CG slots. However, character interaction was too scarce for my liking, which was also understandable but is still not appreciated.   This is not even a complaint about eroge narrative conventions or any one character being particularly misportrayed or underrepresented as some people may feel, since I don't consider this an eroge, and it works quite well as a VN. It doesn't even deserve the 18+ tag in my opinion (yes, with the patch and all) because it's just a story that has some sex in it. Which is a little graphic. Change one or two angles minimally and this is completely tame. There are plenty of books and TV series that are much more graphic, and aren't at all marketed with that. It's hardly ever even mentioned in any sort of commentary or coverage. Take Ken Follet's The Pillars of Earth, for example, which even has graphic assault. Perhaps people are more sensitive about pictures, but pictures of much harsher things are so easy to come by nowadays, and you see much of the same in sex education at schools, the label becomes a farce. Which makes me rant. This is a filibuster though, not really anything to do with the game and the reviewer criticism wouldn't much change either way, except perhaps in tone.  However, having played the previous games, I would retroactively buy this one at the price above, and I probably would even if I hadn't played it yet, just because the first two parts, over 30 hours of playtime for me, are free and would even be worth the price of a full game to me, though I doubt they'd find terribly many buyers that way. XD   And finally: The ending is good. Though I also liked the original ending of the Mass Effect trilogy, so maybe that is not for you. Also, it isn't the ending of the series, and will not even stay the ending of this game (the latter feels like a bit off a loss, since the impact is just right like this). Still, the developer is doing their best to meet the criticism:         Announcement:  Massive V2.00 Update Announced&nbsp;",

It's certainly a step-up from the original Sunrider: Mask of Arcadius game (playable for free). The quality has gone up significantly (as far as the visual novel style is concerned). The game also upgraded to full-voiceover (except towards the end for some reason), and the UI is more streamlined. I don't want to give any story spoilers, but I will say that I eagerly await the next installment.   As for combat gameplay, they changed the combat system slightly. Attack animations have been cut (not sure if that's good or bad), and the executive command system is slightly different (firing Vanguard cannons is a much bigger commitment). I'm still finding that the combat system is a little buggy (maybe I'm using the wrong graphics card?), but the strategic and tactical challenge is still there, unless the RNG decide you're not allowed to win.  One thing about this series that I do wonder is how much my choices affect the outcomes of the game. I've certainly noticed that certain missions play out differently or are harder based on your choices, but I haven't played through any of the Sunrider games enough to notice if my decicions affect the story significantly. If anyone would like to inform me about such things, I would appreciate it in a private message.  EDIT: It took some time, but the latest updates have Liberation Day at its finest! Just goes to show that good things come to those who wait. I LOVE THE [RE]turn Story. It's exactly the kind of multiple endings I was hoping for from a game like this. The only thing I do wish it had was a Cosette route. I'm not sure how that would fit into the programming or even the story, but I think that would truly complete this saga. I also feel like Cosette deserves some kind of happy ending, especially after how certain events can play out in the main Liberation Day story.

The extended ending is short-ish, but works very well as a follow up to the pre v2.0 ending.  ---   Pre v2.0 Review below this line.   ---  Pros: New ships to command. Bigger battles.

Forced route for a chick I don't even like is just a painful experience (might have been more tolorable if the plot was more well written but sadly, it wasn't). There is a sudden change in tone and pace from MoA, a certain character pretty much became the main girl for no apparent reason.   (Chigara pretty much became the main girl for no apparent reason)  . You are basically rushed into this relationship without explaination and development of characters.  I actually quite liked the (limited) English voice over for characters from previous Sunrider VNs, not hearing them in the paid game is simply disappointing.  As it stands right now it's likely that I will not be paying for future Sunrider titles unless V2.0 change my mind. I'm hoping that V2.0 will be a change big/positive enough for me to set the review for this game as recommended.",

            "review_text": "Well, length wise this is basically one Arc of Mask of Arcadius... which is kinda uncool. I think the whole game adds up to about 10 battles maximum? No wonder I'm fighting against Carriers already during the second battle. At least 2,0 added some much needed story content, but still, this game really needed more meat to it. At the least, there should be some Cosette character development (Her English VA is really cool though! My second favorite after Sola's!); otherwise why keep her in the brig at all? You might as well have her help out for some mini mission (Soft Kayto is that soft after all) and escape right after.  Gameplay wise, god playing this on the 'normal' 'Captain' difficulty is a bleeding stress test. While it adds some tension that is very well sold in this game, let's just say that I prefer not to age 10 years after a single game. My real life is stressful enough. Also, once again the short length of the game made both Research and Store fairly painless to go through. In MOA it's far more consequential because everything carries over to the next Arc. There should also be a tutorial of sorts to guide new players who didn't play MOA to know what the heck is going on. For example, that difficulty spike right after Battle 1, like holy wow it is like a fighting level 1 slimes at a training ground and suddenly a level 50 boss drops in and tears the player to pieces.  Character wise, man, I quite like it that there's actually conflict, jealousy and hatred going on within the 'harem' because it's realistic, but on a different note do you seriously have to have a yandere Chigara? There are enough stereotypes in the game already...  Music wise, well, it was more epic when I played MOA I think, although I suppose the game length might've affected my perception. Suddenly it's the final battle and I didn't even realize it's the end until I've gotten the achievement. Also, that price tag for the theme song, like seriously? Am I just stingy or was it always this pricey, because as far as I remember the price tag of this type of DLC usually comes with an entire album of OSTs??  All in all, man, if you plan to expand on Liberation Day and make a second Arc or something like MOA then I suppose I can recommend this game. But as of now, even as a fan I cannot recommend this to a buyer new to this series, Without playing MOA beforehand this game would be utterly confusing at best and a huge turn off for any newbies attempting to enter the series.",

Doesn't particularly fit in with the captain I was playing in the previous game. Much preferred the alternate romances, again of the previous game.   If there is another game in this series, I will probably wait on reviews before picking it up.   tldr: was hyped for series, this one's forced story path lost me. Closest we'll get to Gundam Tactics on the PC though.",

Forcing the main character to love a character make the player (me) hate that character, thus there is no emotional impact about what happen to these lovebirds. New characters (essentially villains) are far more charismatic than the player allies. I want Lynn, Alpha or that redhead genius strategist rather than Claude, Kryska, Asaga or Chigara. You should have taken more time to deliver a bigger and more ambitious more traditional VN, with a common and routes for the girls, instead of rushing it, adding a short 'what if' story with sex scenes (appreciate it, though) to contempt whiners.  4/10  And there is THAT. Yes, Sekai Project, one of the worst company ever that has killed visual novels as I liked it.",
