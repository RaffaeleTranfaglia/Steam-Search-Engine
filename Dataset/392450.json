What initially seems like an open-and-shut case unfolds into a truly terrifying mystery that will leave the detectives wondering what is...",

            "review_text": "This is an interesting game, not really much to do outside of collecting some blood samples, notes and a few other items.. It'll take you in and around 40 minutes to an hour to finish the game, it's short, and story driven. The first part in a three part series, this one starts the story, and a very good start to say the least.  The price... free.. free always works for me. You lose nothing by trying it out..  I'd recommend this game as it doesn't require much of any time investment, it's simplistic, free, and best of all interesting.   The Story... seems to be inspired by movies like Twin Peaks, or games like Deadly Premonition.   It's not scary, or overly complicated atleast not yet. The bones are there for a interesting story to be laid out, it's just a matter of how good the developer will keep the story moving forward. Like all great mysteries not much is revealed in the first part.  The gameplay.. Is your typical RPG maker fair, move around with either the K&amp;M or plug in your controller and kick back.. The gameplay consist of you finding items in three crime scenes,, the items all lay in plain sight and no real puzzles exist just yet.. A few items you're required to pick up have no use just yet...   I'd recommend playing this one, if enough people download load and play hopefully the developer will finish up the three part series and the remainder of the story will be revealed...",

            "review_text": "All in all, not a bad little game. It'll be interesting to see what additional gameplay elements come after this first chapter. There appears to be an rpg system (hit points, etc) so I expect to see some combat eventually.  Art direction note: I noticed that many of the characters share the same facial structures. In truth the only real difference between some of them was skin tone and hair style. This was probably just a cost/time saving measure which I can understand. But it's a little sloppy. Considering the first chapter of the game was free I won't complain. However, I would prefer to see some more individuality in the cast. Even if it's only minor characters who get that treatment, it's still distracting. It's a small town, so you probably won't need too many different sprites. (Or don't even worry about individual portraits for people like in Final Fantasy 6) But it would go a long way (at least for me) to see that tweak.  One minor note to the game makers (should they read this), at one point during the dialog Sara refers to the storage at the back of the car as a 'boot'. We call them 'trunks' in the U.S. so you should either change it to 'trunk' or have (I believe his name was Phil) say that line since he's from England.  All in all, it's a decent introduction to what seems like it might be the child of a JRPG and Silent Hill. I'm interested in seeing the next episode and curious as to how much it will cost to unlock the entire game.",

            "review_text": "What attracted me to this game was the SNES art style. It was also free. Anyway, Silver Creek Falls is a mystery/adventure game that puts you in the shoes of two detectives who are sent to the small town of Silver Creek Falls to investigate three bizarre crime scenes. It is a peaceful town so the sudden crimes that have been taking place are a little odd and considered to be related. That's up for you to decide. The story, which in this case is a third of the full game, is intriguing enough so far. Some of the writing is a little simplistic and cringe-worthy at times, but it does the job. The characters are fine, but it's still too early to draw any conclusions. One of the detectives is a big Boston sports fan while the other is recruited from the Scotland Yard.  The gameplay is fine, but it hasn't been too interactive yet. Most of the gameplay has been clicking through dialog and investigating crime scenes. At the crime scenes, you essentially walk around and click on blood splatters to collect blood samples. You also pick up evidence that might deem useful later on. Perhaps it's too early in the game, but right now none of the found evidence has come into play. I'm hoping that, like Ace Attorney, you are able to draw conclusions and make assumptions based on the evidence that you find. Maybe that comes later in the game...but right now none of that stuff has come into play.  Finally, the art style might have been my favorite aspect of the game. Characters are sprites and you roam around the little town and crime scenes which are also sprite-based. There hasn't been much to explore in the first chapter, but all the areas looked pretty nice. It would have been nice if the letters you find, as well as the map that you can reference, were consistent with the art style. They are regular images that just seem off-putting next to the rest of the game's assets. Anyway, not really sure if I'm going to continue with the three-part series. The story is fine, but the gameplay needs some improvement if it's going to capture my attention any further.",

            "review_text": "While the game itself never delivers on the Lynchian promises made by the trailer and fails to touch upon moments of genuine tension, Silver Creek Falls remains an enjoyable experience for forgiving players. The core mystery works as an excellent hook and I quickly found myself wondering how it could all possibly fit together and the soundtrack, while not excellent, does a fair job.  What detracts from the experience is lazy design. While I fully understand the limitations of the RPG Maker engine (such as the graphical quality and the cookie-cutter feel), there are issues within the game that arises not from these limitations but rather from a failure to properly beta-test. In dialogues the text will on occasion go beyond the borders of the box. Punctuation's seem to be a frequent victim of this. The game works fine when you do exactly as expected, but deviate just a little and the cracks begin to show. Characters will gladly repeat the same dialogue over and over with no awareness of the player already talking to them five times prior. This is lazy design, especially considering that the game is extremely short.   The English used is for the most part decent with a few oddities pulling you out of the experience. A brief stint with actual voice acting is both hilariously flawed and adorably earnest but also terribly overwritten. In general, the game is a linear hallway leading you by the hand from point to point and I can't help but feel the experience would be more immersive had the player been given the option of navigating the town and encountering more people. Allowing a more natural progression of events to take place. As it is, the game occasionally grinds to halt to deliver clumsy exposition. Parts of the plot come across as very forced, and the inexperience of the writer (and the crew in general) shines through in these moments. Characters never feel either quite human or have that subtext of being just a little off that is so often a staple of these detective stories.  In conclusion I will say that Silver Creek Falls: Chapter 1 is a great 'first game'. Beneath the clumsy and lazy design there is a compelling mystery to be solved. The big picture works, but it's all the little things that detract from the experience. The whole is better than the pieces that form it. This is a game that could have been thrown together in a week, but I still enjoyed it for what it was. Both as a game and as a study in what can be done with the RPG Maker Engine.  Should you get this game? Yes. Will I play the next chapters? Maybe. Will I pay money for this game? No. And neither should you.  In short: A good first from a creative team that does show some potential. Play it.",

            "review_text": "I tried, but this game is just too simple for me.  I haven't played enough to name some pros or cons but the thing that realy killed it for me was the overload of useless small talk. The text just keeps on rolling with the most nonsensicall information you ever read in a game. The creator tried to bring in some emotion while he was at it but that didn't work out either. Let me elaborate a bit more... I walked around a crime scene where some girls went missing. Blood all over the place. First thing I found was a Ouija board... who doesn't have one of those right?  Did I mention there was blood? Good, cause you can start to collect it all... 22 pieces total(if I got em all). The deputy tells you there were 4 girls living there but 5 went missing... (how would he know that that missing person was also there, right?) The biggest mistake the creator made was; leaving a note in a room saying that there were 6 girls, not 5... how did the deputy not see this? He even mentioned they swept the place once and took some pictures. Well all riddles aside, the next crime scene one of the main characters just takes out his gun, starts shooting, the other main character asks 'What made you shoot like that out of nowhere?' and he replies 'I just saw something looking at us from that bush' and that's the end of it... no further questions asked! At least, after about 10 minutes, you do know that the Red Sox played last night, that Norfolk is closer to the crime scene than Dunham and that the Sheriff was once invited to an important persons party...  TL;DR Too simple for my likings, picking up 22 blood samples from a murder scene is not realy the game I'm looking for.  But it's free so that's a plus.",

The story is compelling enough, and heading into the crime scenes was enjoyable, with you gathering evidence and trying to piece the mystery. However, I had a few gripes with this game overall:  - There seemed to be no way to mess up your investigation, as leaving the crime scene without an important piece of evidence will trigger your partner to keep looking for clues, until he conveniently forgets to mention this once you've actually scoured the entire place. This avoids backtracking sure, but also tells me straight off the bat that it'll be a linear game too. Give me options if I collect everything, because I have that evidence, give me different routes, that sort of thing.  - Again with the linearity, once you'd leave the crime scene, you had to go straight to the second one, no freedom allowed. I criticize this because close to the ending of Chapter 1, you're forced to walk and thus given some modicum of freedom. However, this 'freedom' didn't really mean anything as you could only go to one place. If you're giving me freedom to wander around the town, again, give me options.  I'm still recommending this because the cliffhanger ending got me intrigued to see what the rest of the story holds, and also since it's free, so I can forgive its small flaws.",
