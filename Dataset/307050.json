Too short for the price in my opinion. Better get it when it's on sale if you can. Voice acting is not so good. Anyway, I have such a cute Achievement Showcase, so I'm good!",

            "review_text": "I purchased this as part of a bundle, it was on my wish list for a while but I didn't buy it directly because frankly I wasn't sure what to expect from this title. I have so many games and reached the point where I agreed not to buy any new ones until A - I had completed or at least tried a lot of the games I currently have or B could justify buying it. A bundle had 2 or 3 of my wish list games on so I had to take that chance.   That being said I still had no real idea what to expect from this title as I installed it. I decided to just jump into it, and I'm glad I did.   In simple terms this is a Chinese story of a girl (Han Hui) who decides to visit areas of her past (for reasons explained in the story that I do not want to give away), and upon her journey she meets a wonderous child (He Jia) who claims to be local and aids in Han Hui's adventure. Through their adventure which lasts only a day they help each other with their problems and become very close, though through it all not everything is as it seems.   I really don't want to give the story away so please forgive the basic description. Just know that if you like Chinese fables, beautiful scenery with well drawn images, don't mind slightly broken English and have a few hours spare then this is worth a try.   The translation of Shan Gui is Mountain Expensive....which leaves me puzzled (about the expensive part). I know some Chinese so I double checked but found it to be true. Still, that isn't something to be put off by.   Additional Note - All achievements are easily received. 7 come from the story and 1 comes from watching the credits. So if you are an achievement junkie then rest assured you will 100% this.",

The character design and game music are no more than average, however, the biggest problem is the story. It is utterly sketchy, boring and full of cliché we know from manga/anime. The descriptions are overdone and clumsy and after a few minutes, the game is just a pain. Finally, there are no choices whatsoever in the game. I strongly recommend against buying this game.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Nice story, but very short, even by visual novel standards. It's enjoyable, but buy it on sale.  Shan Gui Is a pretty simple visual novel with a nice story. I can't talk too much about it without spoiling anything, but it basically follows the story of a young college student who is visiting a rural part of China to remember some memories she made with her family there. There wasn't anything too unexpected in the story, but it had a nice message of remembering to enjoy the little things in life.  The art is decent and they did record voiceovers for the two main characters. Gameplay-wise, well, there's none. There is literally no interaction with this game whatsoever other than clicking the mouse to advance the text, there aren't even any choices to make like in most games in this genre. You are just there to enjoy the story and that's it, though they did include a gallery option if you really want to look at certain art again.  While I did enjoy the story itself, it's quite short. I finished the whole game in 60 minutes, and with the lack of choices for replay value, there's really not much of a reason to play this more than once.",

The incredibly detailed backgrounds do look as if they are lifted from photos, but hardly look out of place next to the main characters, and transition well to and from the CGs the game bolsters, which can thankfully be viewed at one’s leisure.  There are points of noteworthiness, but as the titles goes on they become far less common when compared to all too common mundanities.   About  Shan Gui centers around a college age Chinese girl who is spending a summer’s day visiting the Purple Mountains she visited in her youth. Eventually meeting a younger girl who guides her through the gorgeous area, while helping her uncover details about her past and come to peace with aspects naturally revealed during the story.

I have 2.1 hours on record just because I let it sit to get the other card drops.  + The background graphics are stunning compared to some of the other VNs I've 'played'. + Even though it was linear and short, the story was okay with some unexpected twists (at least for me). It still has some negative points that are covered below. + The OST is relaxing piano music. + Low cost. I got it during the current (2015) Holiday Sale for $0.49. + The artwork, OST and other things are available under 'Extras' in the game.  - Even though the character overlays usually fit well with the backgrounds, sometimes the styles look completely different. - Han Hui is overly endowed, is wearing a Madonna bra, or something. I wouldn't even call it fan service because it just doesn't look right. - What's with the fan service with He Jia? She's supposed to be a kid. You can see it in the Store page gallery. - Along the same lines, some of her dialog is straight out of the gutter. Again, a bit odd for a kid. - It takes a while for the story to actually start progressing. As a whole, the story really doesn't make sense. Also, some of it either seemed superfluous, out of place, or just weird. - The voice acting is bad. It seems forced and off-key many times. - THE THIRST IS STRONG WITH THIS ONE.  Overall, I'd still say it was a good buy. I killed an hour before bed with beautiful graphics and relaxing music for $0.49.  ---   For more...    My Reviews   ||  My casual gaming...

The ost is also good, it's very relaxing.  Hearing another language was very interesting, some of their conversations are pretty fun btw (ice cream time rofl).

You play as this girl wandering in a forested mountain area in search of tranquility and old memories when another girl comes along to bring her to all of these lovely and nostalgic places. The art and music is excellent, and it meshes well with the simple but heartwarming story. On the other hand, the voice acting and translation work is of poor quality, which is rather disappointing.  In short, a happy little story with pretty pictures and calm music. As for a recommendation, I am rather neutral but will give this game a thumbs up because the negatives aren't great enough for me throw it under the bus. If you can get past some mediocre voice acting and its very short length, then this will probably be fine. Hooray...",

Pros: - Really well drawn art, both in backgrounds and character design. - Relaxing music - Auto function with no additional choices (this is both good and bad) - Jia (the little girl) was very likeable, the girl who did her voice acting was pretty decent. Her playfull personality came through in the sound.  Cons: - While the art was really good, I feel there should have been 3 times as much art in both backgrounds and character poses. - Voice acting of Han (the girl you play as) was terribly done, she talked with the same tone the entire time with no emotion what so ever. - The sound of the voices is terrible. it sounds like it was recarded from a laptop that's 15 years old. Even without a studio a proper microphone could have made a world of difference. - Auto option with additional options/choices, while this made the game relaxing it does feel a bit like a ripoff when advertised as a game. I simply sat in my char doing nothing but read. ",

In addition, the story is charming and very nice to see the interactions between the MC and the mysterious young girl she meets. I'd wish it was a bit longer and that perhaps I'd have a few choices to make, to make it a bit more interactive. Nevertheless, it's a great little gem to sit back and relax and to enjoy a good story.",

There's only one story path and one ending, but what is here is done fairly well. There are a few forgivable typographical errors here and there, but I was surprised by the quality of writing in general. It's better than I had anticipated. I've played many a game created by native English speakers with far worse English grammar/punctuation. Kudos to the translation/localization staff.  The soundtrack is calming and well suited to each scene. There are a few points where it cuts out entirely, in an attempt at dramatics, only to start back up again shortly thereafter, and honestly it feels more jarring than anything. That's pretty minor though, only happens a handful of times in the story and is never too detrimental.  Artwork is fantastic, very serene choice of imagery that really lends credibility to the setting, and helps make the locations visited feel well realized.  Give this visual novel a shot. For the price you really can't go wrong.",

I would not recommend this to anyone unless you're an aspiring developer who needs an example of how not to do a visual novel.

Pros: - Beautiful scenery artwork - Very calming soundtrack  - Short and easy to follow story - Hyperlinks in game to Wiki pages so you can get additional info about where parts of the game take place and the history of the area. - The game has a better options menu than many more expensive games you would expect to have good options. - The game is avaible in a large selection of languages. - Steam Achievements/ Trading Cards / Low Price  Cons: -The character artwork didn't feel as detailed as the scenery and the exaggerated breasts on the main character on the steam page lower your opinion of the game without actually playing it you would think it was something else. - While short is nice it may be too short and while talking the scenery or characters emotions could have had a bit more variety, You get descriptions of things off in the distance but don't get to see them from the characters perspective unless they go there, and even then you see it from the perspective of them being there not the view they described.  Overall as the first visual novel I have played I would give Shan Gui an 9 out of 10 aside from the very small details I mentioned above which don't really take away from the game I can't think of any flaws with the game, The artwork and music are both beautiful and the short story was very sweet and I really enjoyed it. I definitely recommend this game at normal price, even more so if you can pick it up on sale which it goes on often.",

For all Polish players =&gt; please, don't play it in Polish language, the translation is WOODEN and emotionless, sorry but it is true.",

            "review_text": "Shan Gui is a short kinetic (no choices) visual novel with a simple but sweet story. It was cheap ($0.50 on sale for me), and I'm a big fan of visual novels, so I had to give it a shot. It personally took me about an hour to get through the game once, and overall it left a nice impression on me.   Pros:  + Lovely artwork (the backgrounds were especially gorgeous) + Voice acting (In my opinion, some of it was good, some of it was meh. Nothing too bad though). + Dialogue translated into multiple languages. + Decent music (nothing out of this world, but it generally fit the mood). + Free soundtrack included.  + Super easy to get 100% achievements.  + Can craft adorable badges and emoticons using the trading cards from this game.   Cons: - It's really short, a little too short imo (especially if you buy it at full price).  - The story's cute, but kinda bland. I really wish Han Hui's story was elaborated on a little more, as it felt a little rushed. It's a shame as I personally thought her story had a lot of potential.   To be honest though, I really can't complain much considering the cheap price I got this at. Overall, Shan Gui was a nice little read, would recommend to anyone who enjoys visual novels and wants something simple and relaxing to kill an hour or two of time.",

Do you want to spend over one hour trying to figure out how to get the 'From Beginning to End' achievement?  If so, buy Shan Gui! Plus, it's on sale for another 25 hours, which is awesome!  Shan Gui is an interesting and short story that could be a nice addition to your Steam Library, as you may not have many nice games. I would recommend this game to anyone who has spent   most of their life   a lot of time on shooting games (or games like that) and wants a change or break from it.   9/10 (It could be a bit longer and include a bit more things)  P.S. Hold space to skip quickly through the story and get 7/8 of the achievements.",

The artwork is very good, though there was one point where her Han Hua's eyes looked REALLY weird while eating a sandwich. But one way or another. I'm...honestly not sure If I think this is worth five dollars. It's not bad and if you like to be told a story with images then it's for you. But as a game itself, I cannot reccomend it.  If you're an achivement lover though (Which is part of the reason I got it) then you'll like it. They are ALL easy and story related aside from one which explains itself. In under a half hour I went through it and got them all.  The story itself was VERY predictable. I had it figured out almost from the get go.  So all in all. As much as I don't want to be one of the few public review and negative. it's all I can do to be honest.",

Bought this game because I wanted to try out what those visual novels are about. I can only speak for myself, but I did not enjoy this. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.  ",

I would highly recommend this to all people interested in visual novels as it only has the single route with Jia. I'll definitely be playing this through again.",
