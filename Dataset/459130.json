            "review_text": "  A good improvement compared to the previous titles released by these developers. The art style is simple, and the only thing that bothered me was the lack of expressions on the characters (they usually have all the same face, sometimes it might change just a bit). But that’s a pet peeve of mine, maybe other people won’t see this as a flaw.   The soundtrack is really good. It was what made me buy this game at first!  Also, this is probably the longest game by these devs. It didn’t felt rushed, the routes were more elaborated and the characters were more likable. Get it on a good sale!  5/10.",

            "review_text": "Following playthroughs of Last Days of Spring and True Lover's Knot, I came into Love in the Glen with lowered expectations. Those expectations were met: This visual novel improves only slightly over TLK and takes steps back.  One definite step back is the art style. Again, if the cast is supposed to be adults, make them look like adults. At the very least, TLK's characters, despite also looking like 16-year-olds, are far more polished in their rendering than those here.  More steps back: the return of the video clips, the all-too-frequent minigame, and the odd choice of voicing an answering machine message when no other dialogue is voiced.  The length of LITG is a slight improvement. I do appreciate that this game does not leave the big decision for the end and instead counts choices made throughout.  Unfortunately, the story is unpleasant. I definitely did not enjoy the setup for the MC's reentry into the dating world, and I did not detect much romantic tension between her and any other character. The romances are just kind of there, because this is a romance game.  Finally, the problems with the story go hand-in-hand with problems in tone. Sometimes the MC sounded more like a teenager than a 32-year-old. And who says 'Awesome' in a moment of romantic passion? At least three characters in LITG do. Maybe that's just how they do it in LA.",
