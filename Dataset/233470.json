            "review_text": "It's not often that I find myself really enjoying a game but agreeing wholeheartedly with the people who gave it a negative review. Yet, that's what I experienced with Evoland, an RPG that bills itself as a 'journey through the history of action/adventure gaming'.  Evoland exists more as unrealized potential than as a genuinely good RPG. The gameplay/story elements it gets right are amazing, but it also has many problems that keep it from being a standout in the genre.  The game itself takes heavy influences from the Final Fantasy games. You start out as an random knight in a forest, quickly gaining the ability to do basic things like walk in different directions, fight enemies and learn more about the plot (which is only there for the sake of an achievement joke). From there, you meet a young girl who aids you in your journey and you both set off to defeat the evil lord who's trying to take over the world. Pretty standard stuff.  More than anything else in the game, the plot (and by proxy, the introduction and jokes about various RPG concepts) is really only good for the first hour. Many of the gameplay elements fall apart the further you go into the game.  Chief among them is the random battle system. Not only is it incredibly annoying (you get attacked every few steps on the world map), but there's no real purpose for any of it. You can attack or heal, and you gain levels that give you more HP or magic power, but this doesn't translate to the rest of the game. There are three distinct battle systems - the standard RPG turn-based system, a Torchlight-inspired hack-n-slash with a health globe, and a Zelda-esque dungeon mode with heart containers. None of these systems have anything to do with each other, and there's no point grinding in the overworld.  The same goes for the collectibles you find. There are gamecards (based off Triple Triad/Triad Master from Final Fantasy) that are scattered throughout the world, but their purpose is never clear until halfway through, and playing games with them is pointless. There's a powerful magic attack that unlocks after a boss battle, but you have to wait a very, very long time to use it, and its only use is to kill trash mobs. You get a bunch of items dumped on you during the hack-n-slash dungeon, but most of them don't do anything at all, and the minimap you gain in said dungeon doesn't even work half the time.  It's frustrating, because when the game is firing on all cylinders, it's a wonderful experience. There was a moment where I was trying to figure out a puzzle in a forest, seamlessly switching between 2D Zelda-style graphics and a full 3D realization of the same forest, and marveling in awe at how fluid the transition was. Likewise, there are some amusing jokes and throwbacks to games like Final Fantasy VII and VIII that had me smirking as I played.  The best part of the game is the sense of achievement you get when you find a new chest, and open it for a random surprise. This runs the gamut from increased graphics to gameplay changes, new weapons and more. It's that sense of pursuit for the next unlock that drives my enjoyment of the game.  The gameplay itself is also enjoyable, and the constant belittling of the main characters by NPCs is quite amusing, especially when you can't speak to adults in the early game until you eat a magical seed that inexplicably causes you to age a decade and become an adult.  In the end, I felt that Evoland was a great experience in spite of the problems associated with it, and I'm excited to see what the developers will bring to the table for the sequel (also available on Steam). The evolving gameplay and charming characterization is what sets this apart from a lot of other RPGs.  Definitely worth checking out, if only for the first hour.

I don't want to sound disrespectful to other reviewers but one must be really thick for sarcasm to think that 'Boots of Vaal Undersoul' that gives you '+10 to hit &amp; run tactics, for when the boss is just too strong' is an item that pertains to a game trying to pull the Diablo tone.  This game is, instead, a parody, or a humorous homage if you will. It changes its gaming style between dungeons rather quickly, starting from the most basic 2D game, and thens slowly evolving into FF7/Diablo/Zelda-like. This game doesn't give you any depth in  any of these gameplay styles  and that's why it is interesting: the focus is  not  in the combat, nor the graphics, nor the puzzles, the story, the character development, the plot... everything in this game is a parody. Take it or leave it boys, this is a  parody . Got it?  The achievements are fun, I had to consult a guide to get some of them. It also works natively on Linux if you follow this  guide , but be warned that it is not supported.  The only downside of the game is that Gamepad is not supported. Shame on you, Shiro Games, shame on you.",

            "review_text": "Evoland is an original game, with a great idea, but to be honest, it doesn't really work as a game, no matter how small or big it is.   It starts off brilliant, in black and white old school 2D. Opening treasure chests grants you access to other features, features frequently seen in other RPGs, like 3D mode, loot and NPCs. That all sounds amazing, right ? It is, but the game lets you unlock all the features way too soon. Halfway through (the game lasts about 3 hours, 5 hours max if you want to collect everything) you've seen everything there is and the game starts focusing on the story (if you can call it a story). I was a bit disappointed by that, because the things that made the game so original became unoriginal and uninspired near the end. The random battles were especially starting to annoy me, since it triggers every few seconds and it's not always clear where to go. Like I said, it's something you see a lot in other RPGs, but in Evoland it backfires. A 3 hour game shouldn't become boring that soon.  Get it when it's on sale. Because even though it isn't the best game out there, the idea behind it is good and should be witnessed by others.  [Rating: 66/100]",

            "review_text": "Evoland is a nostalgic trip through the Adventure/RPG games that started the genre. It is inspired by many well known titles such as Diablo, Final Fantasy, Zelda and more. Evoland lets you play through the 'evolution' of the graphics, gameplay and features of all of these games mashed up into one very well made RPG. You play as the protaganist of your choice alongside the sidekick/healer of your choice as Evoland allows you to name these characters. Starting off in a 2D (black and white) sidescroller you embark on a quest to find chests which contain fragments of a finely polished and more modern RPG. From the first level to the final-boss fight Evoland is full of fun and adventure with many interesting branches into different regions containing stars and Double-Twin cards which are well worth grinding for if you are an achievement hunter. Evoland is overall an innovative treat to add to your library and with a well-deserved sequal it is definitely worth getting.   Pros: - The evolution is a wonderful idea and has great implementation - Stars and Double-Twin cards are a great addition to keep people playing for longer - The 'Ruins of Sarudnahk' level drops are very humorous and a great part of the Diablo theme - Story is well written and has a smooth and well-executed build-up - The 'Time Travelling' using the crystals to complete puzzles is challenging and a fun way to get some of the final chests  Cons: - Evolution happens slightly too quickly and compactly in the beginning compared to towards the end - Hitboxes are broken for certain enemies and sometimes for the final boss - No way to know exaclty which Double-Twin cards and stars you are missing until the end of the game - Random monster encounters happen way too frequently to a point where it can get annoying to have to leave a region before you have the airship  Gameplay - 7/10 Immersion - 8/10 Graphics - 7/10  Overall rating - 7/10",

Its funny but if it was a bit more consistint it would be better.

It's terribly hard and it's not terribly easy. I haven't beaten the game yet as I write this review but I can say the concept is amazingly interesting and the minigames such as the Card game you can play versus npc's makes it feel less like a single player game and a lot more like your standard top down view mmorpg.  (Somewhat Cons) I'm uncertain if the game will have much more costly items as you move along in the game but I felt asthough the loot you were given (Glis and Exp) was much too high as combat lasted up to 30 seconds versus normal encounters and 2 minutes againts bosses. When you add in your first combat partners ability to heal you and herself this gives you and unlimited supply of HP and the ability to simply farm for hundreds of thousands of 'Glis' (The games currency) without any worry of dieing.  (Somewhat Pros) The game gives you a very clear depiction on how games have evolved and managed to smoothly tell a story within that evolution and adabt to those changes as the game moves along while still making sense. And with minigames on the side the game never gets boring and the gameplay rarely gets repetitive as its constantly changing.  What would I do differently with the game? I would of added note bubbles that tell you what controls do what as you move along as it took me 5 minutes to figure out how to leave the game. I'd also add in a map function like what many horror games have that will show you a map of the game or dungeon but will only show you area's that you have been in. It would make navigation throughout the world much easier.  My opinion is based off of 1.7 hours of gameplay to which in those 1.7 hours I made it to the point in the game where we meet our first companion uncle for the first time. Those who have played will know what I mean by this. So yes talk my opinions litely as i have not unlocked the complete evolution of the game yet ad it is possible that what I recommend wil be unlocked by playing further into the game.  I do recommend this game to those interested in experiencing a game that gives you a gameplay style from the first ever pokemon to the modern Diablo 3 Style games. ",

This game does not do anything that you haven't seen before... and still manages to be original.  However, the game is a bit short (4 hours, 6 if you want full completion). It also suffers from a sometimes questionable level design, and a repetitive soundtrack.   Finally, Evoland suffers from a pretty major pacing problem. Early on, you will keep on noting how clever the mechanics are, how cool the nods and references to videogames tropes feel, and how the world is evolving with you. However by mid-game, this sensation will be gone - not because you get used to it, but simply because the game stops throwing anything your way. It just becomes a barebone version of existing games, and by the end you may find yourself thinking you'd rather play the masterpieces Evoland references rather than Evoland itself.  Evoland is a brilliant idea, and an absolutely cute game which loves to take advantage of your gamer instincts and reflexes.  Sadly besides its concept, the game itself is a bit stale, if not repetitive. I didn't think I'd say this one day, but I wish the game held your hand more, because this is where the game shines. Evoland starts off strong, and ends rather weakly. The games has tones of potential, and for the prices, it is definitely worth getting a look at, but don't expect too much out of it.  With all that said, I am extremely excited for the upcoming sequel. Evoland is a rough diamond and with enough polish, could be a BRILLIANT game. Wait and see...",

I assume most people giving negative reviews payed the full $10, and I really can't blame them. I personally got the game for $2 which is exactly what I would say it is worth. The game has an amazing concept but it is not very well executed. You move far too quickly in the beginning and the middle and end of the game you unlock almost no changes at all. Once you unlock '3D' (less than halfway through), you're mostly done unlocking stuff. It's also a very short game, 2-3 hours to complete 5-7 to 100%. I would recommend it on sale, otherwise don't waste your $10, or you'll be left feeling like you just played an extended demo for the real game you paid for.",

            "review_text": "I've been eyeing this game for a while now, and am happy to report that it was everything I hoped it would be. Let's get the cons out of the way first... the game is short. If you rate a game based on the hours you get out of it, this probably won't be your cup of tea. You can probably get through it with most of the colletibles in just a few hours. Also, at times, the controls are a little frustrating. This became most evident on the final boss, when I felt that most of my deaths were as a direct result of the way the controls handle (I was using an XB360 pad).   Now, on to the pros, which, I feel, FAR outweigh the cons.   As a long-time fan of RPGs, going back to the 80s, I felt that this game was designed as a humorous love song to those classic games of yester-year. I strongly felt the influences of such classics as Zelda, Final Fantasy, with even a few visual references to Mario tossed in for good measure.   Evoland starts you off with a black and white, highly pixelated charachter, like something you might have seen on the original Game Boy, but quickly introduces new graphics, music, and gameplay mechanics, as you explore the progression of the genre over the years. This is all done while playing through a largely generic story..but I feel that most people who will appreciate this game aren't playing it for the story, but for the nostalgia and fun to be had with this short gem.   In short, if you are looking for a great experience, I highly recommend this game. The story is light, and though it is about RPGs, the RPG elements are thin, but the fun and progression of it makes it a great game to play through on your day off of work, or the weekend. Give it a shot!",

Due to the change of style of RPG videogame in its history, the game changes it game play style to accommodate the progress in history of this type of game both in both the hardware development and the software.  I can’t explain much without spoiling the experience, but if you are a videogamer who enjoyed the RPG games in the 80s, and 90s, then I suggest you check this title, and for the new gamer who showed up after the 2000s, it is a nice game to add in your library that explain in a short way the history of the games you enjoy in this day.  The game is worth 5 to 6 hours, and has little replay value, but you don’t need it at all, as the whole game feels like looking at an old diary of old videogames developers.

Anyways it looked fun and for ten dollars, to me it looked like it was worth. So I gave it a shot, and to cut the review short to me the game is a four out of five. The different forms of combat are nice, but none of them are to extensive, which makes sense but a couple of other options would have been nice. The 3d to 2d gave an interesting puzzle or two I feel like the developers could have worked this a little more, maybe give the game more flavor. Obviously the game isn't there for a story, which is sad because. . .well I like story, the tale told in this one is generic and bland, and so are the characters. However the game is all around great, mainly because of all the awesome references, I mean how many games do you get to fly star-foxes ♥♥♥♥ and carry around clouds buster blade? None except this and maybe minecraft. It also had a decent boss fight at the end, and I wasn't at all disappointed by the battle, it wasn't super hard or anything but it was fun. The game is by no means hard, but defiantly has it's annoy parts, and despite it only being like a 2-4 hour game I've put more than double that into it, don't ask why, I don't know myself lol. Anyways good purchase I'd say it's worth the price if they lowered it by like three bucks. I think if a little bit more development would have been put into the combat, puzzles and story and not let references sell this game it may have been a 5 out of 5.",

The card game was fun, although without some of the stronger cards, it was getting a bit infuriating, but I somehow managed to win after a while. The music and visuals were great, the 8-bit and 16-bit songs were very accurate for the time, and it was neat hearing them updating through the course of the game.   One thing that I wish was a bit different, was the encounter rate while in RPG areas, it seemed to be a bit on the high side. Get out of a battle, take 5 steps, back into another battle. Didn't keep me from playing though.  I really with that this was a longer game, and that you spent more time in each era of gaming... like maybe only crystals updated the graphics, and have a few of them to go from 8-bit to 16-bit and so on, and have the smaller upgrades for chests here and there. That's more or less what I would like in a future entry if there is another after Evoland II.

It will remind you of some of the great things about those games, but is not hesitant to point out their flaws too. Of course, Evoland is not without its own flaws, but this is a parody made out of love for the genre. The nostalgia, the tongue-in-cheek approach and the ever-changing world will make this a joy to play for RPG-fans, and will surely give them a warm feeling inside.",

Nods to The Legend of Zelda and Secret of Mana gave me the most warm and fuzzy feelings. Plenty of Final Fantasy VII references made me say, 'Ah, yes.' But more than references to games, Evoland references the very culture of gaming that I was raised in. The evolution of graphics and other technological advancements is presented in such a compelling way, I'd recommend this game for classes on pop culture or video game history.  Taking the nostalgia goggles off, I find this game tight, well paced and well designed. Nothing seems to be filler and evolutions happen at a rapid pace so as to keep things interesting. The tongue-in-cheek storyline unfolds neatly and with no annoying spelling or grammar mistakes. New play styles are compelling, as well.  While I appreciate the brevity of the game, some may not. It's not a terribly long story though I found there to be some replay value after completion. Players expecting a full RPG that will keep them going for a whole season will not find what they are looking for here. As for me, it took an evening and a morning to clear the story and I commend the designers for not fattening the game. It feels like the right length to make the most of the gimmick without making it feel annoying.  I highly recommend this game.",

Ultimately, most of the unlocks feel like the game is going 'through the motions,' and so the iterations through different art and playstyles weren't as satisfying as I'd hoped. The game itself feels pretty generic - like a crossover Zelda/FF7 clone without the charm. (On that note, the references to other video games are very heavy handed yet feel tacked on. Like characters frequently have one letter difference from what they are from.) I had an okay time playing it, but I wouldn't recommend getting this unless it was on sale.",

An area is plagued by a villain and the protagonist has to defeat him. Players will be able to use a couple characters at their disposable, but there is no opportunity to upgrade one's weapons/armor. Leveling up doesn't seem to enhance one's offense. On average, the game can be completed within 3-6 hours. Despite the cons, I try not to take this game too seriously.

This game isn't about reinventing the wheel or even treading new ground, it's about reminiscing the past and paying respect to some of the greatest moments in gaming; the moments that defined gaming in the past, and without which we wouldn't have gaming as it today. In that respect, this game succeeds.   It's a cheerful and lovingly-crafted tale of bygone days, and while the retro-style throwbacks in gameplay may confuse and fail to amuse the younger crowd, for us retro gamers it may spark some wonderful feelings of nostalgia.",

Any ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that saw the trailer or any of the screenshots can figure that out.   This game is fueled by nostalgia. It's one of those sick meme meta games that tries to make a commentary on gaming. If you've played DLC Quest then you'll know what I mean. Unlike DLC Quest this one actually has some semblance of being a game. This game not only references lots of other games, it features a variety of gameplay mechanics that do the same. It features FF-style JRPG fights, Zelda-esque dungeons, and Dynasty Warriors (I can't think of a better reference) styled mobbing fights. ♥♥♥♥'s pretty greasy. They actually put in a lot of effort to make this feel like a proper tribute to older games and I think they did an amazing job of this. It made me really want to go back and play some older games from my childhood.  With that said, let's get into the negatives. Even though this is supposed to feel like a serious game, it's not. Not by any means is this a serious RPG or Zelda clone or anything. Everything is very streamlined and simple. The RPG fights are simple and you almost never do anything outside of basic attacks and healing. The Zelda dungeons are basically fight monsters and dodge traps. There is literally no degree of complexity involved. Now, this isn't bad because it isn't supposed to be a serious game, but after mashing attack to speed through your 50th random encounter it gets old after a while. The whole game does. It starts off strong but the whole gimmick of the game runs out about halfway through (it took me a little under 6 hours to finish the game and get all the achievements for the lulz) leaving you bored for the rest of the game. About 1/3rd of the game they run out of the 'upgrades' you get. The upgrades being things like going from 8-bit to 16-bit to 64-bit, etc. This is kind of disappointing because you run out of things to look forward to. The gist of it is that the beginning of the game is really fun but after a while it gets boring.  Overall: If you're a nostalgia freak like me and grew up playing lots of older Nintendo and whatever games then you'll love this for the nostalgia factor alone. Nostalgia aside, it isn't much of a game. If you're not playing it for nostalgia then you're going to be really disapointed. I don't consider this to have much replay value so I wouldn't play it again. At most I'd pay like $2 or $3 for this. $10 is too expensive for a meme game you'll probably only play once.",

I love the idea and how they incorperate so many RPG ideas into 1 game and do so with it still feeling fairly natural. There are so many easter eggs that if you are a lover of the RPG genre, you will likely smile throughout the game.  My only real area of improvement is I wish more was done - however this is the first of 2 so will class this as the 'pilot' of the series.  What else would I have liked to see? - More playable characters; it has a turn-based fighting style at certain points of the game, but unfortunately it falls a little short on this as there aren't many character to look forward to - More story; story was great while it lasted, however felt that due to the length of the game this started and ended pretty quickly - More secrets; it is a little game and has a few cool things, but found it pretty easy to run out of things to do  The above is really nit-picking; the game truely is great and if you enjoy things like Costume Quest, this definately fills a nice little place for those who was to have some fun. At times the game could have been more challenging, however I feel it probably would have struggled to have balanced things and taken away the beauty of what this game is if they had.

If only they taken that idea and run with it.  About halfway through the game, when you go to 3D, the tone of the game noticably changes. The focus of the game is no longer on constantly evolving graphics and game mechanics; instead, the game tries to be a straight-faced clone of Zelda and Final Fantasy at the same time. If well-executed, this would also be a welcome development, but the game from this point onward has no depth; sure, there are Zelda-like dungeons, Final Fantasy-like random encounters and a story going on, but the dungeons have fairly basic level design, the random encounters occur WAY too frequently (one every five-six steps in the overworld), the combat draws from a miniscule pool of enemies, and the story is so shallow that I couldn't bring myself to care about anything.

But don't be fooled, the facade begins to fall apart within the first 20-30 minutes. A game pitched as a delve into gaming history very quickly unveils its true colors as a simple list of tired references to 'gaming culture' with a few lines from movies thrown in for variety. Even if you can handle the completely unsubtle references (the earliest and most glaring one being the retrieval of the buster sword, where they literally say 'doesn't this look familiar?' with a straight face) the game doesn't stand on its own in any fashion.   The art is uninspired.  The multiple battle systems suffer every issue from miserable and unfair hit boxes to simple math miscalculations for damage. It pretends to be Zelda, Diablo, FF, and more, and yet pales in comparison to the most rudimentary of battle systems (I wrote a more complex system on my graphing calculator back in 10th grade math) and has zero loot system whatsoever.  The RPG system is literally nonexistant save for 3 items you can buy in the first hour. It pretends to have progression but the numbers don't effectively change anything as the whole game scales directly to you.  The puzzles are long, boring, and unforgiving in required precision at times.  The bosses are tedious and boring, even worse than the 20-year old counterparts they are rehashing.  The random battles do nothing but draw out the length, and trigger frustratingly often.  The writing is sad.  The plot is nonexistant (references=/=plot).  The ending is anticlimactic.  And to top it all off, there's the option to use a gamepad, but it is never mentioned, let alone recommended, and without it, you are limited to 8-way movement, making much of the game much harder than it already is.  I know this was originally part of Ludum Dare, but trying to pitch this for $10 is hilarious. Even at $1 I don't think it's worth playing simply because it intentionally disrespects your time by dragging things out. I'd honestly be more happy with the money I paid if it were 45 minutes long.

Evoland features basic versions of turn-based, adventure and ARPG combat and lasts longer than it should. In the end, it feels like an exercise more than anything. As in, if it wasn't about 3 hours long, I would have quit an hour into it.  Know what game's actually successful at what Evoland tries? Half-Minute Hero. That game actually manages to be a nostalgia trip and a very interesting and enjoyable new experience at the same time. Evoland's more of a slog.",

The graphics are suitable for the time periods of when each generation of the games it imitates are out and there's a lot of references to other games throughout the adventure. Even having not played it for several months now, I can recall references to Mario, Final Fantasy, Zelda, Diablo and others besides. The soundtrack is equally as engaging to the nostalgic senses in the brain and it feels like it enhances the experience that you get when you play through it.  Unfortunately...it doesn't quite have much of it's own two feet beyond that. The gameplay is often an imitation of it's inspiration - and often a very limited experience of what it's imitating - and has far too much crossover for any one influence (or even it's own design) to actually cement itself as an overarching gameplay foundation. For those not floating on the nostalgic waves, this can make the game feel disjoined and maybe scattered in it's design, as if a clown was juggling too many balls to do the fancy tricks other RPG games can do to greater effect.  There have also been some issues that I recall from my last experience of it (hence the 12 hours of playing) where I lost access to my airship through a world map issue and had to restart from the beginning to get full achievement completion. And where item collection doesn't become a habit of face-hugging every wall looking for that one invisible area where it might be hiding, the other time-waster is the puzzles. I will admit, the puzzles sometimes can be pretty challenging to work out and do require some measure of thought, but others bordered the line between tedium and simplistic and a few were essentially efforts to get from A to B taking as little damage as possible.  For those who remember having their chunky white Game Boys in-hand in their teenage years or loved some of the original elements of Final Fantasy, this may be worth the few second-hand DVD's you'd get instead of this game simply on the nostalgic vibes it brings, but even then it may be better to just play the games this one imitates due to the imitation being the game's only strength - and not even that strong with very limited ability set to use. For everyone else, see what the reviewers are claiming this game reminds them of, read up on the games this one imitates, play those instead: You are more likely to get an immersive experience from those than this scripted love song to them.",

The beginning, where you get the different features, is very smartly implemented, and the game has a nice sense of humor. Once you get all of the different features about 40% of the way through the game, it slows down and loses all its novelty.  The game itself at this point alternates between a bad Final Fantasy homage and a bad Legend of Zelda homage, as other Steam reviewers have pointed out. Combat and movement are stiff, the world is tiny, the encouter rate in the overworld is ridiculous, the random battles themselves are completely devoid of challenge or purpose, and some of the stars and cards are pretty difficult to find without help.  On the plus side, again, it has a sense of humor, it's short enough to not overstay its welcome, and it features its own clone of FFVIII's Triple Triad.

This feels like I paid for a tour of an art museum, and was shown three rooms before being thrown out onto the street. The laziness shows through at the seams. They didn't even bother arranging the small amount of content they had into a full map, instead clustering every location together and then filling three-quarters of the world with impassable mountains.  The length of the story is also a disappointment. Part of the problem might be that it does the job of reminding you of other games too well, or at the least, too bluntly. Despite the fact that many great RPGs can be completed in a single sitting, this game fails to acknowledge those games at all, choosing instead to constantly reference series that create the expectation that both the storyline and the difficulty curve will be slowly, patiently built up. However, since this game is so short, that doesn't happen. The endgame remains pitifully easy, and the 'expected' RPG scenes play out in quick succession without bothering to give you enough context to make anything matter.  It doesn't even work as a parody. It's about on par with the 'Movie' movies. References are not the same as jokes. The few actual jokes that could have been funny are skimmed over in favor of getting on to the next thing as quickly as possible. Don't buy this game as a gift for a friend.

However, you eventually gain 3D graphics and a camera zoom in for when you open chests. When you reach this point you can only open chests from a specific side, and have to wait for both the player's animation and camera animation to stop to continue the game. This is after having chests that opened instantaniously and didn't pause player progression. This is just one example of how something wasn't throught out past the initial concept, and the game seems to be full of these. after about 45 minutes of play and two dungeons I was incredibly bored and felt like I had seen everything the game had to offer.

When you get an achievement, it tells steam you're playing it, gives the achievement, and then disappears from telling steam you're playing it again. There was no steam overlay either, and I do have it enabled, so idk there. Also, right off the bat it told me to install google chrome for pepperflash, but that didn't work, so I had to do some messing around with their config file and dropping a pepperflash version from someone's on the forums in order to play.  So, other than dumb issues, the game is basically a poor implementation of Zelda with the overworld and some areas being turn-based combat. The turn-based combat has a level up system for some reason, but it does literally nothing, and the combat is nothing other than using the guy to attack and the girl to heal anyway, there's no 'skill' to it at all. There is one area that takes the poor implementation of Zelda, and adds an hp-bar rather than hearts, and then throws a bunch of mobs at you in a sort of Diablo-ish sorta way, but the the combat sucked with the Zelda-ish stuff anyway so if anything it just made how bad it was more apparent.",

Which is why it pains me that this game just doesn't 'evolve'... hehe.... into what it could be.  The first 45 minutes-hour have a lot of promise as you unlock new technologies and cycle through game modes... but after that it trickles out new unlocks and doesn't really go anywhere. It turns into a 'Bah-bies first Zelda clone'. I have got to be frank.... I don't like Zelda (Early titles). The gameplay just didn't do anything for me. I much prefer the strategy of turn based combat. Speaking of....  There is 0 depth to this game. From the combat to the story. During turn based sections you have yourself and a girl character. The girl is the mage who only starts with heal and you a basic attack. Then, by about half way through the game she finally gets 1 magic attack that does the same damage as your sword attack and you get nothing. Thats it. Even on the Zelda side of things nothing evolves past the early Zelda titles. You get a sword, bombs, and arrows.  The story is throw away.  The humour seems to just consist of 'Epic Movie' type refrences. You are a lucky lucky person if you dont know what that means....  Nothing is really done with the concept of evolving through the generations. I would love to see a larger scaled game maybe by some tested devs who could take this concept and just go nuts. I freaking love this idea and I hope to see it around again. Kudos to the devs for thinking of it but I really wish you would hahve developed it more.  Oh, also the game is only 3 hours long. I just kind of gave up half way in because I can't play old school style Zelda without a controller and I just couldn't get controller support to work. : /  Update: I noticed a You-tuber I like had a full playthrough of this so I decided to watch the rest of it to see what I missed. I have to say Im happy I gave up when I did.  The game turns into a diablo like (using that phrase lightly) game after I quit. Again like with the rest of the game there is no depth to it. You pick up loot that doesnt even effect anything and you are still using the combat mechanics from zelda. You get gold drops but gold is useless and cant actually be used for anything.  The story is laughable. Its so crap. I can't imagine what the devs thought when they cobbled that mess together. Maybe it was the day before release and all the writers has hangovers so they got the janitor who played an rpg once like 20 years ago to finish the story for them.  You get a map finally during this section but nothing else happens. The boss fight here is just as lame and uninspiered as the rest.  Then you fight the final boss and finally get a second attack for the main hero which is on a 4 minute cooldown and is only used once. The boss is in 2 sections. You get beat for the first fight and your compainion dies *spoilers but who cares*. You get an airship to get to where the boss moved to because reasons, and fight in a zelda type boss fight. Then credits roll. Thats it.  I can't understand how they were able to think of such an awesome concept for the game but didnt have a single good idea other than that.

All of the “humor” in the game is basically the game pointing and saying “isn’t this dumb?” It is basically explaining the joke, except there is no joke, just a reference to an older game which isn’t very funny.  The game seems to suggest that you’re going to gradually move through various eras of games, but by about a third of the way into the game, you’re already up to 3D graphics, and it doesn’t really go beyond that. The game feels almost as if it has to rush through to unlock all the earlier stuff and then get to 3D for some reason, even though, quite frankly, the 3D gameplay isn’t very good (but then, neither is the 2D gameplay).  Ultimately, the game is meant to be funny, but isn’t, and is meant to be fun, and also isn’t. The gameplay is as tedious as any old, poorly designed game with very little content; the JRPG overworld encounters happen every five steps or so and are pointless and tedious, while the dungeon Zelda-type movement is very basic, containing very little variety of monsters, none of which are particularly interesting to fight. The game contains three bosses, two of which are pretty boring; one of them is basically “stand there and hit it until it dies”, and another is a standard “dodge the charge and hit them” boss. Only the final boss shows any signs of real gameplay, and even there, it was kind of tepid.  There’s just nothing here for anyone. If you’re looking for humor, the game isn’t funny; if you’re looking for a game which is fun to play, this isn’t. It doesn’t even feel original, as literally everything in it is referential, meaning any “originality” it might have from the whole idea of evolving into the modern day of gameplay is basically dead on arrival, buried under a pile of old video game references.

            "review_text": "Evoland is an enjoyable, well-designed game for the short time you play it, filled with references that gaming veterans will easily pick up on and appreciate. However, the incredibly short playtime and some weak and ineffectual, forgettable sequences downgrade what is a good game into something that really is not worth paying for.  Gameplay wise, Evoland does what it advertises; in the beginning you start with not much at all in the way of gameplay options, even directional buttons need to be unlocked. Slowly but surely, however, the game is built around you as you play in a clever merging of gameplay and ideas. The graphics are charming throughout and as a kind of 'museum' of RPG tropes over gaming's history, the game succeeds in the showcasing aspect.   For the short amount of time you do play the game, it has a decent package; the gameplay is as you'd expect, the story does its best despite being restricted to parody territory as a result of the design ethos the game was going for, the sound is enjoyable if not exactly memorable, but sends up classic soundtracks of the genre in a recognisable way. and the graphics, in addition with how they merge with gameplay in a memorable mid-game puzzle sequence, are charming and work for their purpose in showcasing the history of the RPG genre.   However, while these ideas work to some degree, once you get past the initial impression, the game's elements all fall down as you start to look for something deeper. The storyline is basically just trope descriptors and script-reading in its most literal sense, the gameplay has some memorable and interesting moments, but over time specific elements become unenjoyable. For example, the random encounter system becomes infuriating, not least because the game's battle systems are just skin-deep at best. Combat in this game is not enjoyable and it is not deep; it's 'servicable' enough and works for the purpose of a showcase, but it really is a shame that the gameplay was not expanded upon to an extent to make Evoland worthwhile as a game in its own right. The world-building is restricted to a point it appears lazy and the sound is, as mentioned before, not memorable in its own right.  In addition to the game elements described, the length of Evoland is a cause for concern; other Steam viewers can see how many hours I've put into this game: two, to be more precise. Within two hours, I had beaten the game, and the feel of reward for beating the game any further just wasn't there for me. The game is not deep in the slightest so I had no motivation to dig any deeper as I had finished, because what I had found thus far was not valuable enough as a game to keep me coming back to try to find all of the secrets in the game.   Because of the creative ideas behind Evoland, it is a shame I am writing a negative review of this game. Evoland is, for all intents and purposes, a collection of decent ideas. It is unfortunate, then, that these ideas are never expanded upon except in the most rudimentary sense.   In conclusion, while Evoland succeeds in a small sense that it is a sometimes-humorous and appreciable showcase of the RPG genre, the incredibly small number of hours of very shallow gameplay that Evoland provides is not satisfying enough to really make it successful as a game. I would not recommend this game because it is simply not good value and a big disappointment considering how this game never lived up to its potential to be something truly interesting.  ",

            "review_text": "As other reviewers noted, this game isn't so much a journey of action/adventure games so much as it is a journey of RPGs--notably the Final Fantasy and the Legend of Zelda series. Which, admittedly, still promised a lot of fun and engagement, but didn't really deliver the way I'd hoped it would.  It incorporates both old-school turn-based RPG combat and your older 'hack-and-slack' style combat reminiscent of early Zelda games. However, these forms of combat alternate, so that most world-map combat is turn-based, and the majority of the dungeons and forests are subjected to the hack-and-slash that can be a little jarring in transition. The turn-based follows a familiar timer system, where you cannot attack, heal, run, etc., until it's your 'time' to do so.  While it admittedly did bring me a good bit of nostalgia, the game doesn't have much to stand on beyond that. As much as I found myself enjoying the ability to 'unlock' the advancements to the game such as 16-bit color or 3-D rendering, it quickly grew tedious and monotonous. There's not a lot of story or plot to keep you interested in long term play, let alone to replay the game, and it doesn't have that something special to set it apart from other games, as it seems to rely to heavily on the nostalgia to carry the game. I did like some of the puzzles that had you switching between the 16-bit era and the more modern 3-D game structure to move through them, but it wasn't enough to make the game stand out.  Furthermore, if you're looking to play this game purely through the keyboard and mouse, you'll be a bit disappointed. The space bar acts as the action key, and movement can only be achieved by your direction keys. It makes the older style combats (particularly your hack-and-slash) a bit more difficult to pull off with finesse.   In the end, I can't really say I'd recommend the game--unless you have the time and money to kill, and don't mind enduring some frustration during gameplay to do so.",

            "review_text": "Evoland was a novel idea, but mediocre game. I’ve never played a game that has shined quite as bright at moments with such long stretches of uninteresting hours to separate the before mentioned shining moments. When I first bought and started Evoland I had nothing but the highest expectations for what the game was going to be. In fact I tend to have a positive bias and fondness to developers who participate in game-jams. Especially when they decide to realize those games as full fleshed out projects. However the benefit-of-the-doubt flame that burned inside me began to get snuffed out fairly early into Evoland.  Shiro Games (developer) creates a hero out of a young boy (no, really!?) who seems to need to purge the world of a darkness from what I could put together. The game already had an innate humor to it, but they escalate the comedy through various items and achievements. These moments although funny seem to get washed down by the endless amounts of grinding to the point of a random encounter every 2 seconds. I could usually handle this, since I need them xp’s! However this becomes ever more frustrating when half the game you get to use it, and the other half switches between a Diablo-esque combat system and a Legend of Zelda style which is used far more for the puzzle style dungeons.  With far too little story to keep my interested I quickly found myself losing interest. Fortunately I was rejuvenated with the introduction of Evoland’s card game Double Twin. Unfortunately I lost interest again once I had beaten the only man to play all the way through the Champion level with basic cards and no real reward for doing so. We’re all suckers for rewards in these games. It makes all the bad wash away.  Throughout the history of traditional style RPG’s there are two things I’m looking for as a player. The first being story. A good story can make me play through the most redundant and ridiculous gameplay just to get my fix. The second is gear. I will play a game for hours on end just grinding if it means rare drops. Evoland did neither of these for me, except in the Diablo-esque portion of the game. Which happens to be my favorite part of the game. If you played the Evoland then you’d know that during the Diablo-esque point in the game you get loads of loot, all fake, all hilarious.  Evoland consistently suffers from the need of to hold back. If only Shiro Games decided to have less restraint than Tom Green on speed Evoland easily would be worth the time and a huge recommend. There are a few other issues, such as pacing and bugs, that even more absurd comedic elements wouldn’t allow me to overlook and give it an 8 or 9, but it’d be a realistic 6.  The game also found itself contradicting itself with what you had unlocked and the randomness of switching gameplay mechanics at awkward moments only added to the overall games confusion. The only time this switching was explained or made sense was by the use of time altering crystals, which were used very appropriately as puzzle mechanics. These frustrating moments left me bewildered, wondering if I had missed something, or if the game really was just going to continue and contradict story. What I mean to say, and to better explain, is that the game used chests to unlock different eras that were locked away by something evil. If this were the case, why were certain areas not changing when I went back to them after I already had unlocked a newer era? Even switching between similar visual styles was jarring, and easily dismissed if they would have just put forth an effort to explain why. With how outrageous this game could have been, all it would have taken is to make mention of some sort of barrier covering certain areas of the world restricting mechanics and graphics. Possibly explained to you by a NPC, which there were far too few of as it was.  To end this before I start beating the cliche’d horse (or is it already too late?) there is a lot of potential from the small French developer. This game was a stepping stone. If they learn from their mistakes I will be very excited to learn more about their newest title.  Find this review and many others at  www.PunchDrunkAlley.com ",
