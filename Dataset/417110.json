            "review_text": "Don't be fooled by it's cute graphics, this visual novel contains very heavy themes, so be warned before you get into this. Mayjasmine covers the events of the May 1998 riots of Indonesia, and in a way, I am grateful that Erotes Studio decided to write about these dark historical events. It makes people - some unknowing - aware of what happend (and perhaps make some research more about these events after they're done reading). The quote on their post explaining the motivation behind the creation very much resonates with me, which is 'History can be forgiven, but never forgotten'. I was curious about how they were going to go on about it, as it is a very sensitive subject. Not only that, I wasn't even sure if I was going to pick it up, as I read some very negative stuff about the English translation (which can definitely be a dealbreaker). As it was on sale for 75% off, thought I might as well try it out. ...And I'm very glad I did. This visual novel has managed to touch me deeply and even send shivers down my spine. The translation isn't nearly as bad as I thought it would be, it's ok and playable in my opinion. If you can overlook some spelling and grammatical errors every now and then, you can experience this masterpiece for what it is. Loved the writing, graphics and voice acting, good job to the writers, artists and VA's. I look forward to seeing more of your works on steam, Erotes Studio!",

            "review_text": "Well, it is true taht the English translation needs a major overhaul, and that you can 'beat the game' in less than a hour (first pathway), to then 'beat it again' (alternate pathway that will now be unlocked) in about twenty minutes. However, the whole game is a serious lesson on how low human being can go when led by ill intented gurus.  Bottom line, this VN is the recolection of actual events, which the victims deserve to be remembered...",

            "review_text": "Bought it when it was 75% off, at that price it's worthwhile despite the translation errors; sure it takes a little bit longer to read but it's worth the trouble.   I hadn't read any visual novels that had a different perspective that you could play through after the first but reading it through that way cleared up any previous opinions I had on Yu-Qing. Character development was well defined in both routes though I was hoping there would be more on Zi-Jin as his characters seems to remain flat compared to others.   I came into the game not knowing much about the 1998 Jakarat riots of Indonesia but I was still able to enjoy the story to the point of tears. The racism, violence, and beliefs the game portrays has lessons throughout, ones I had at first thought would only pertain to that time, were lessons that I still had yet to learn and ones that I may even need in the future. I enjoyed their use of quotes even if it seemed a little strange coming from an elementary student.   For episode 2 and 3 I hope there will be better translations. The story already seems so complete with one episode, but I look forward to what the other episodes will bring.",
