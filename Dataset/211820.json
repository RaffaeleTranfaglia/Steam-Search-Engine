            "review_text": "*TL;DR at the bottom*  Look at the most popular reviews for Starbound and 90% of them are negative even though the overall review is 89% positive. While many of these negative reviews do address issues with the game, I do not think they are giving Starbound enough credit.  'Starbound is space Terraria' I do not think it is fair to compare Starbound and Terraria. Yes they are both 16-bit adventure/sandbox games, but each plays very differently. Terraria is more about the gameplay and having fun. Starbound is about the experience. This game throws you into a universe and gives your character a story. Each game is fun in its own way. (On a side note I actually like the combat in Starbound a bit better. Terraria's combat is too 'arcadey' for me, but that is the appeal of the game for some people).  'Progression is too fast' I got this game years ago when trying to progress through the game was like trying to swim through maple syrup while handcuffed. I would spend hours looking for enough fuel to jump to the next solar system. Now many people feel that progression is too easy. There is a fine balance between too fast and too slow and it is hard for developers to get it right the first time.  'Interesting things have been removed' I agree with this to some extent. A while ago there was an update to starbound that added new food and farming mechanics but removed hunger. I was sad because I really liked hunger, but they added hunger back. The devs can always add back old things if they feel like the game needs it. Sure, a lot of cool content was removed, but does anyone mention all of the cool content that was added? Ship upgrading, the outpost, new combat mechanics, etc. Yeah some cool things have been removed, but far more ccol things have been added. Most importantly there is something called modding. If you want temperature back, someone has made a mod for it. Chucklefish has a vision for their game. They felt like Starbound did not need temperature, so they removed it. If you like temperature and feel like it would make the game better, you can add it. Modding is not meant to fix the game, but it can enhance it or alter it towards your specific tastes.   ---------------------------------------------------------------- In the end I think people are more vocal about what is wrong with the game than what is right, and Starbound doesn't deserve that. Does anyone mention the amazing soundtrack or solid 16-bit graphics? Very few. Yes the game needs critizism, every game does. That is what allows a game to become better. Just remember that this game can be a great experience if you don't just focus on the bad.  TL;DR This game has issues but it also has many great things to offer. Look at more than just the negative reviews and you will find an amazing game.  *Edited to clarify my comments about modding.",

            "review_text": "Edit: added more fresh memes and minor text edits  You read the reviews of negativity, of all the old days of Starbound and old people ranting about how it used to be better back then.  But if you're really new to Starbound, why should you care? You weren't there in the old days when you had to walk uphill and downhill in the snow, when the koalas were furious, and when everything was all cream and gravy.  I'm not going to lie, I'm an old person too. I miss those days of temperatures being able to kill you.  I miss the days of sectors and the map upgrades.  I miss being able to cheese the bosses when you used their spawn items.  I miss my bubble tech and my old characters.  I miss when the toolbar only had one L and one R.  But that's for the old people to mope about. Sure, I miss it, but that time has passed long ago. New things await ahead, and I can't complain about that. It'll never be Old Starbound, but it'll always be Starbound to me.  I think if you started here, you'd find something you would enjoy. You wouldn't be dragged down by the good ol' days. You would be happy and free, like a child experiencing the world for the first time. Just sit down, relax, and try Starbound for yourself.   Why let someone else tell you what the world is when you can see it for yourself?  Go out there and explore Starbound. You might find something you could never imagine.    There's also a race of Harambes. You can explore galaxies without pants. You can slaughter innocent people of towns you find. You can kill your friends. You can play pokemon and enslave small creatures. You can be a weeaboo fish man. You can get anime blades. You can hire hardcore penguin mercenaries to 'ice' people. (BAHAHAHAHAHA) You can even download an absolute overabundance of mods you don't need.       YOU CAN EVEN BE A PRO GENJI LIKE YOU ALWAYS DREAMED OF WITH MODS TOO HOLY ♥♥♥♥ JUST GET THIS GAME RIGHT NOW  ",

            "review_text": "I have to say, I'm amazed with Starbound.  I bought it some years ago just out of duty because I started playing on an old version downloaded from somewhere. Let me clarify that the reason for me to do it was because at the time Chucklefish removed the hunger and environmental hazard factor from the game, which are two major points that would drive me towards a game, but I'm a guy of principles who buys the games he downloads and happens to like. The art was great, but the game heavily lacked direction, feeling a lot like a sci-fi terraria, hugely directionless where you just plopped on a planet, built a nice house, and ransacked other species for decor items and maybe some weapons. I was not impressed.  Recently I decided to give it a try if anything because I owned the game and hadn't taken a look at it since two years ago. And honestly, the game is great now. Not only there's a story, but there is a great sense of progression through quests aimed at improving your character, tech to unlock, and a plot that drives you to explore and push onward.  The art is gorgeous, and now that there is a reason to explore the different planets meeting the gajillion of pokémon scattered throughout the game is both exciting and fun. The survival elements are back and although I can see why they took them out of the game, feeling like more of a nuisance than anything involving (there's food everywhere and you'll have no problem staying fed), the element of preparedness and routine gives another dimension to just going down every hole you'll see.  The objectives are distinct, and the exploration is tense since you'll have to double back from whatever hole on the ground you dove into and death means losing a huge swathe of items. A lot of the equipment you'll find is more aesthetic than anything, and weapons are kinda meh, but it's super satisfying when you find that weapon combo that works. Action bars are somewhat small but you can switch between two bars, making the overall hotkey capacity alright. The techs are fun and meaningful, getting a morphball or a double jump that greatly helps with exploration, and weapon abilities are varied and useful most of the time.  The only problems I really have with the game is that the controls could be a bit better for me, like for instance when jumping down a platform you'll keep on going down subsequent ones until you release the 'down' button, making it possible to hurt or even kill yourself, or that double tapping in a direction can trigger Dash and send you careening down a hole to your demise. Sometimes you'll also find yourself in some really hard to win combat scenarios, but taking it slowly will help with that so it's not too bad.  Overall though, I think it's a great game and that it has improved leaps and bounds from its SEA phase. The sense of progression is tangible, the settlements are fun, the exploration is intense and the story is nicely told in great pixel art scenes. From an aimless Terraria in space to a proper metroidvania, Starbound has propelled itself to the stars of my library.  9/10.",

EDIT: Starbound 1.0 is out! Come back and do all the fetch quests all over again! This time there's removed content and still a large disparity in balance. There have been some improvements such as scanning objects to your 3D printer now, but they're immediately counterbalanced by setbacks such as needing to (nearly) max out your ship first before you can start custom decorating everything with 3D printed furniture.  All variety between biomes and racial storylines have been completely consolidated and forced along linear progression now. The arid, deserted, ded landscape that was Starbound's 'endgame' is now slightly more decorated, but to compensate, all the other biomes are now as empty as it used to be! Hooray!  Oh and don't consider multiplayer until a few months after this when people may get third party multiplayer servers working, the official executable is currently a hot messy pile of insects and arachnids if you get what I mean.",

It felt like an exploration sandbox where you set your own goals and did whatever you wanted on your own time with no one to nag you.  Now?  Well, theres this insanely half-baked and arbitrary 'story' you have to put up with and its basically demanded of you to go out and scan enough things to fight a stupid boss repeated 6 times over untill you get to one of the most lazily named bosses I have  EVER  seen in a video game.  Some more problems i have with the game include but are not limited to:   Crafting has had roughly half of the racial items completely culled from the tables, making it boring.   Un-needed crafting times of 0.5 to 10 seconds have been added since early access, which begs the question. Why even have them?   No longer feels like an exploration sandbox.   Race spesific ship AI was removed. (why?)   It also got a lot more annoying.   Guns STILL suck colossal dong.   Game feels like it has less than when I considered it 'bare bones'.   Start feels like it was there just to add roughly 2 minutes of play time for whatever reason.   If they decide they want to actually improve their game, I'll change my reveiw as I have done with other things in the past but for now.

            "review_text": "The early access was brilliant, better than this stable version.  Currently the game (1.0 release) has scaling issues and is quite imbalanced, underpowered towards the beginning and overpowered towards the end, with a middle game that barely exists as you try to power through planets to get to the next set of upgrades. It used to be a fun type of grind, but with the general need for more items (volume, as well as different type) to upgrade things it becomes gradually more frustrating. Although the pace for upgrading your MM and Tech feels a bit better. The change to equipping items feels terrible, initially I thought I'd get used to it like a person normally would, but it feels too unnatural. You need to equip many items in general: melee weapon, ranged weapon, torches, rope, trash blocks, flashlight, health kits. That's mainly for exploring, even then more items can be added. And for some reason many items that you think would be single-handed are actually two-handed. Great! Even more switching to do!  The need for food to restore your hunger significantly adds to the monotony. Go out into that vast universe - and become a farmer! It does get better, but takes away from the experience nonetheless.  The array of items and scenery is great; planets are much more interesting. Playing with friends has never been easier also!  It's got a lot of potential, it always had. They're holding it back with trivial design and incessant chores.

            "review_text": "Starbound holds a special place in my heart. I've had the game since 0.1, and on multiple steam accounts. The game has always had the best oppurtunities to become one of the greatest games around, but it never QUITE made it.  All of that changed with the recent 1.0 update, marking the full release of the game.  You know have a fully pledged story, with interesting and deep characters, insane ammounts of lore and backstory and over 8+ bosses. Talking about bosses, they range from everything between a spider made of flesh, to a penguin in a futuristic war machine. Every boss is very unique, and their attacks never cease to suprise me.  There are 6 classes to choose from; A robot, A fish, A plant, A collection of gas, An ape and of course human. This sounds very bazare, but as soon as you create your character, you can already read a simple recap of the races backstory.  Starbound is a sandbox gme, and it is a prime example of what a sandbox game should be. You can choose to never mine a single peice of ore, never craft a single peice of armor and wether you want to live on your ship, or on one of the unique procedurally generated worlds. There is thousands and thousands of different blocks and furniture, which comes in great use with the colony system.  The colony system consists of you creating a house, and putting a colony deed inside. The colony deeds cost 750 pixels (the ingame currency). You can choose who will live in the house by either decorating it with old chandeliers and bookshelves, or weapons and armor. You can get everything from a merchant to a guard, and they all come together with the procedural quest system.  Quests (That arent outpost or story related) are always procedually generated, yet they're still all very unique and fun to do. The people who will give them to you are either random NPC's or inhabitants of your colony.  If you so happen to complete a lot of quests for a specific NPC, will he request to join you on your adventure, as a companion. It is only possible to have to companions with you at all times, but it can range verything from a penguin to one of the many races of starbound. The sandbox aspect comes in very real here aswell, as you can either get companions by making colonies, ore buying your way to illegal penguin mecenaries.  If you get enough companions on your ship (You can have as many as you want, just only two with you) your ship will get bigger, leaving you with more room.  There is an infinite universe to explore with many weird and funny biomes, and deep and interesting dungeons.  The weapons of Starbound; The weapons come in many shapes and forms, some silly and some deadly. They, like so much else in this game, have prodcedurally generated stats and looks, which means you will find something cool about almost every weapon you find.  Verdict: If you want a game with litterally endless things to do and create, and many unique enemies and weapons, you're at the right place. Starbound is huge, and for the gamer that likes to read, there is huge amounts of lore to dive in to. There are plenty of easter eggs and references scattered around the massive diverse planets, just waiting for you to find them.  9/10",

            "review_text": "I'll start off by saying that Starbound isn't a terrible game. It certainly has some positive qualities. It looks fairly nice; it's a very colorful game with some very well-designed sprites. The mechanics are pretty solid, it feels good to play the game for the most part. It also has the potential to provide hours upon hours of entertainment.  But, despite some of these positive aspects to the game, there are huge problems with the game, and with the developer. I'll list some of these below.  1. The first of these issues is that Starbound has been released as 1.0. This is a problem because Starbound is not a complete game, there are still changes to the game's features that the developers plan to make in the future, and in fact, some features have been removed from the game so that the 1.0 release wouldn't be delayed, with uncertain statements by the devs that they  may  consider re-adding them in the future, post-1.0.  This is unacceptable in my opinion, because they're marketing this game as complete, and yet they may still end up making huge modifications that some players will be unhappy with, players who spent money on what they assumed was a final product.  2. As I mentioned above, Chucklefish have removed content from their game, and this has happened on multiple occasions. I would not normally condemn a developer for something like this, but much of the stuff they've removed have been things they've shown off in multiple dev blogs, content they've spent many hours working on, content that had no realistic reason to be removed. Dozens of racial weapons, racial SAIL AI, local chat, a number of vanity item sets, and much more. No reason has been given for this removal of content, content that was interesting and, in many people's opinions, contributed to a game that was originally very complex in design.  This further leads me to believe that this game is an unfinished product, and one that I fear may be subject to additional content removal in the future.  3. The third issue I have with Starbound is not so much directed at the game as it is directed at the developers, but it's an issue that affects all consumers of their product; Chucklefish's unreliability. Throughout the development of Starbound, its five year development of which half was early access, Chucklefish have made promises that they've failed to deliver on and yet have made no attempts to apologize for or acknowledge. Several release dates have been given in the past over the course of these five years, and Chucklefish failed to meet all of them. On several occasions, Chucklefish promised there would be no more universe or player wipes, and yet time and time again they forcibly wiped universe and player files thanks to seemingly arbitrary changes to file structure which have never been explained.  These would not be such concerning issues if Chucklefish had actually taken the time to explain to their players why these things were happening. Not once did we receive a blog post explaining why a release date had been missed, or why another universe/player wipe was forced.  4. And then the storyline. Admittedly, this is more of a personal feeling of disappointment than a glaring, objective issue, but the storyline is so incredibly generic. It follows the most basic formula possible; I'll do my best not to spoil anything, but you, the main character and thus the center of the universe, are one of the few survivors of a catastophe. You escape on your own and have to find your way to the hub world, where you meet the plot device meant to drive the story further. You're buried in exposition and sent off on your quest to defeat the ultimate evil, which had been sealed away ages ago and is finally breaking free. Eventually you face off against it after working with a crew of unique individuals and destroy the evil once and for all.  There was once a pretty interesting concept behind Starbound; you were a nobody trying to survive on your own after escaping certain doom, making do with what you could forage and build from the wild. They ended up trashing that idea and focusing time and effort on a boring story mission when their efforts should have been focused on the sandbox elements for their sandbox game.  I could likely rant on about this, but I've rambled long enough. Starbound isn't a terrible game, but because of the issues it's had in development, I cannot in my right mind rate it positively. It wouldn't be fair to the people who are expecting to buy a complete title. As far as I'm concerned, until Chucklefish is satisfied with Starbound's features and has no intentions to change them further, it's still an early access game.    TL;DR: Chucklefish spent five years on a game that they constantly removed assets from, dumbed down the story, broke promises for, and still can't decide whether their game should have new features added or not. Buyer beware, what you purchase now might very well be entirely different from what you own a year from now. ",

Contrary to many opinion, this game is closer to being Fallout 4 in 2D rather than Terraria in Space, while I feel Starbound tried to push their idea further than Fallout 4 did, but it ultimately suffers same fate.  It has many, many interesting system and game play, but none of them are exceptioanlly polished and well connected with each other, resulting in double-edged disjointed experience.  As a person who tried translating this game, amount of work Devs put into this game is frustratingly detailed and extreme in size even after all those contents cuts as they progressed. Notice where I said 'Frustrating', this is because Starbound Dev team likely made common development mistake of 'Trying everything that designer throws at the project', which results in immensely bloated project with number of contents that are seemingly impossible to polish.  Main cinematic quests are at best feels disjointed, at worst, it is directly conflicting with interactive building, exploration, collecting, and base management. And that isn't only the cinematic quest's problem.  Still, this also means that you can distract yourselves when you exhausted interest from single content to another. But this advantage is mostly unaccessible if you dislike playing with other people.  As current price tag of 16.99 CAD, this game indeed worth every penny to purchase. So I will recommend it.",

The hotbar has been replaced with a consolized abomination, instead of the old terraria-style hotbar you now have six options with a right and left hand slot with all your matter manipulator tools smack dab in the middle. It is extremely unintuitive and I have no idea what went through chucklefish's head when they redesigned it.  Early game is still an annoying slog. The game sells itself as an 'extraterrestrial sandbox game' but for the first few hours its just a 'sandbox game'. You need 20 mcguffins to activate a portal that takes you to the game's hub world, and you either need to be lucky enough to find a mine that has said mcguffins, or spend a few hours gearing up and digging to the core of your starting planet to find them.  Temperature was never brought back. On a freezing planet and need to warm up? No amount of campfires or clothing will save you. You will freeze to death unless you craft the magic heating backpack. Same goes for radioactive planets and extremely hot planets. Your only survivabilty is from a backpack and none of the hundreds of items you used to be able to use.  The story is absolutey atrocious. Its almost like it was an afterthought, what with the poor writing and cliche plot. Earth is destroyed by a giant tentacle monster, collect X amount of artifacts from all the races and kill the tentacle monster. Entirely uninspired and could have been left out entirely with no negative impact.  The hunger system seems to have never been fixed either. Survival is just a pain in the ♥♥♥ and is no fun at all, the hunger bar depletes from full in about 20 to 25 minutes, making you halt whatever you're doing to either find food or eat a buttload of whatever you have on hand. Uncooked food barely increases the bar while cooked food increases it more, making it even worse to manage.  And I'm not even going to talk about the missed release dates and lies spewed forth by Tiy/Molly in the past, its just not worth it anymore.  Honestly if chucklefish didn't mismanage their company as much as they did and faff about with the whole 'moving to london' process (which took far longer than it should have), this game could have seen an earlier release, and hell, it would probably be better than this sorry excuse of a game.",

The biggest problem though, is the crashing for no reason at all. Alt tabbing, teleporting, moving stuff in my inventory have all caused a crash for unknown reasons. Even starting up the game and getting to the Chucklefish logo caused a crash once. And that fish is starting to annoy me more than the Duck Hunt dog. During Early Access the only problem I had was an occasional slow down and trouble connecting to my brothers to play together. Luckily the multiplayer had been simplified with 1.0.

The only thing I want to point out myself is how much this game tends to rely on the community to create new content so it can be enjoyed. I've seen a large number of mods available that fix, enhance, or even overhaul concepts in the game that were otherwise very tedious and just not fun.  I would recommend this to you if you're willing to modify the ever-loving crap out of this game right after purchasing it, but otherwise I wouldn't tell anyone to go out and buy it until Chucklefish stops relying on the community to make their game better.",

So does this mean the game is no longer a 'roller coaster' as I put it, where every clever idea is countered with an idiotic design decision?  No.  Indeed, for every annoyance fixed, a new one is added to the game. Development has been a tumultuous cycle of game balance and interface changes. Will they fix a genuine source of player frustration? Will they fix something that wasn't broken in the first place? Will they fix a problem merely by removing a secondary issue that made it unbearable, rather than fixing the problem itself? Will they break something else entirely? You'll never know until you're already in-game.  As of now, literally every other nitpick in my old review is dead and buried, but the only remaining constant has been the inability to pause in singleplayer. I recall complaining about the hunger system, and how being unable to pause made it so that just getting up to tend to some real-life distraction required an investment of time, to secure a spot and slap down a bed lest you starve to death. Remember what I said about fixing a problem by removing an exacerbating issue? They shifted the hunger system away from the easiest difficulty. Gee, thanks for making the escape key a mere annoyance rather than an elaborate method of suicide.  I want to bring up the latest wave of nitpicks and genuine 'what the ♥♥♥♥ were they smoking' moments of this version. But like the issues of the last review, these will pass in time. Half of them, I'll look back on and laugh at myself for complaining. The other half, I'll surely wince at whatever new problems have superseded the old.  A long time ago, my final suggestion was that to recommend you wait, and only buy the game after a good series of updates so the devs will have time to get their ♥♥♥♥ together. That time has come and gone.  This time around? I still recommend this game. But the game has been, currently is, and will surely still BE equal parts fun and frustration.

            "review_text": "I wanted to give Starbound an immediate recommendation as soon as it came out of beta, but it's changed over the years. Chucklefish dumbed it down over time until its formula became an extremely stale version of that of its older brother (Terraria): a series of boss fights with filler content between them. Starbound's filler content consists of relatively dull mining (extremely tedious before you start upgrading your matter manipulator and getting crucial basic techs) and walking around in NPC villages looking for randomly-selected pieces of furniture that push you closer to unlocking a boss battle.  The techs and more important pieces of gear you unlock don't feel as 'embraced' or balanced as they do in Terraria. Your first grappling hook will make many of the game's puzzles completely trivial, but most of the alternate techs are useless or very mild variations of the original ones. A shield will make the game infinitely easy compared to using a two-handed weapon (which may have a somewhat-useful ability that pales in comparison to a shield's ability to keep you alive), but it makes the game more monotonous.  Starbound should not be considered a 'survival' game in any way. There is a hunger bar in its standard game mode ('survival'), but food is incredibly easy to keep up with regardless of how you do so. It becomes nothing more than a passive healing buff you should maintain (but can easily afford to forget for 5-10 minutes), not a critical concern. Other survival elements, such as overheating, radiation, and cold (actually, that's all of them) have been turned into simple equipment checks (do you have this special backpack? No? Then come back to this new planet when you do).   The colony system might have been what kept me hooked, but it boils down to doing fetch quests over and over again just to make merchants sell more things (that are typically garbage) or regular colonists to join your crew (who tend to get in the way more than help). Your colonists are effectively invincible pieces of walking furniture that emote and give you money every now and then. You don't have to do anything to maintain them, and they don't help you outside of giving you money (which is already easy to come by because you'll constantly be selling useless outmoded weapons). Colonists do not starve, become thirsty, or interact with farms (animals or plants). Speaking of farms, there is no way to automate them at all.  I would say the game is still worth a positive review, but the 1.0 release caused the game to stutter/lag for me constantly (which causes various issues, mainly 'teleporting' enemies), plus the aforementioned dullness. I might try mods, but only after the performance issues are fixed.",

I always wanted to have a sandbox game where I can do whatever the hell I want in the infinite universe, and Starbound is that game.  'Then why do you give this game a negative review?' You might ask.  Let me first tell you what's great about this game: 1. You have your own spaceship where you can travel wherever you want; 2. There is some nice variety in planets, monsters, biomes, weapons etc.; 3. There's the story, which isn't really deep or complex in quests, but it's good IMO; 4. Each race has history and culture... except for Novakids but that's because they don't care about history; 5. There is a lot of stuff to upgrade, collect, buy etc.; 6. You can play on instruments and form a band; 7. A lot of other things I don't remember...  Now with the issue that just makes me get bored in this game really quickly:  ...  I honestly don't know. I just don't want to build anything. Just a thought of it demotivates me from playing, so does collecting stuff because I know that stuff like fish or cooking collections will just end up being a chore. I didn't even get myself to decorate my ship. All I did was to upgrade it to maximum size and then just left it half empty... I keep trying to guess what deters me from building in this game. Maybe the game is too small? Maybe there are too much furniture to pick from? I don't know... And I have the similar issue with Terraria, though there I also have issue with how it is unfriendly towards newbies (more on that in my Terraria review).  Now, it was a hard choice between recommending the game or not. My personal experience is just slightly more towards no, but that's just me. If you had similar issues in Terraria, then you will only have fun doing main quests, you'll get bored after that. If you play Terraria a lot though then by all means buy it, you won't regret it. Now for those non-Terraria players. If you like space and exploration, then I guess you'll like this game. If you are also creative and like building, then you should give it a try.  ",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer: this is my first review, and the reason I'm writing this is that the line between 'good' and 'bad' game is not so visible to a person who is not familiar with Starbound, and therefore I feel obligated to end my juorney with Starbound like this.   Overview   Starbound got into Early Access in 4th of December 2013. Before that, the lead developer Tiy had formally announced Starbound in February 2012, and a kickstater-esque pre-order opening was launched on April 2013. Starbound was released on 22 of July, 2016, when it had been on development for over five years.    Synopsis   Starbound sets you up in a planet with no other resources except your ingenuity and a Matter Manipulator, a clever tool used to harvest wood and ore for your use. As you get familiar with the crafting, you notice that the interface is a bit clunky and finding what you'd like to make gets harder as the game progresses and you are given more crafting recipes. The planet you're on contains many secrets, such as dungeons and chests for you to explore. The procedural generation gives a noticeable difference to all planets, and even though certain biomes on different planets look the same, there is a difference in my opinion. After you have explored the planet you're on, you can teleport back to your ship and find a new planet in your current system, or use space fuel to travel into other systems. As you progress, your stuff gradually gets upgraded from medieval style to sci-fi.   The game progression   Starbound has many different resources obtained trough different ways, like farming and mining. Although all the planets are beatiful and have something to explore, the player wants to progress in the game; getting better armor and survival gear is necessary. However, once you notice that making some armor requires cotton, your nice and perilous adventure in the planet's core isn't as nice as it was. It's good that Starbound doesn't hold hands on telling you where to find certain items, but that brings me to one of my strong points on my critique: exploring isn't fun if that exploration doesn't guarantee you to progress, and on the other hand progression is meaningless if nothing changes. Unfortunately Starbound achieves both of these bad points, even though it seems that it tries so hard not to.  There is no guarantee that a dungeon has something rare for you, or if it does, it's stuff like one or two pieces of matter manipulator modules. Which you need a lot more if you hope to upgrade your manipulator. On the other hand, when you find your items you need to progress, you're thrown into more dangerous planets but the premise is still the same: find out what stuff you need to upgrade your crafting stations, dig deep, don't die. Return, notice there's a resource you need but don't know what that is, get frustrated. Also, building shelter / a fancy house to yourself serves no use, as you need to switch planets to progress; meaning you need to bookmark that planet to return to your nice dwelling.  Starbound tries so hard to not be repetetive it's almost funny. I understand that these procedural concepts are really hard, but that is not an excuse if you have five years to polish your game.   Development   The story of Starbound is like a children's fairytale to indie developers. There's the good things, the bad things, and the moral of the story. The good things in my opinion are the promising setting, full mod support and enough customization to feel that you are truly unique.  The bad things: Let's just say that I don't want myself to get cencored by Mollygos or Tiy. There is evidence of that, there is evidence of Tiy shilling the game in reddit with alternate users, there is evidence of people getting banned in the official forums for asking how their product is progressing. I strongly suggest every reader to dig bit deeper into this, it's actually pretty funny how this thing was managed. Like the combat system was revised at least three times. Also, the design failures that had been reflected to Steam include a period where Starbound had not had a patch in one year. When Starbound was in Early Access. The excuses to this include stuff like moving into an office in London and what have you. Some games stay in Early Access for a year and they get released. Starbound was in early access for almost three years.  The moral of the story is that you should respect your playerbase, keep your promises especially if you receive money for a product that doesn't exist yet, and that doing freelancer work without any guarantees is a coin flip. I do not personally feel this way, but Tiy has been described from various sources as being 'egomaniac'. Take it as you will.   Should you buy this game?   If you like repetetiveness, go ahead. If you like illusion of progression, go ahead. However, Starbound is still to me an unfinished product with broken promises of features, and most likely will be forever. My own personal opinion is that you should not buy this game, or any future titles from Chucklefish without those titles being of exceptional quality, and nominated for Game of the Year in mainstream reviews.",

            "review_text": "If steam had a 'neutral' option for recommending, I'd go for that.  Starbound changed like a billion times during development because the devs couldn't decide on what they wanted the game to be. They made a procedural building-exploration game only to realize too late that not tying the key concepts of building and exploring together with something concrete (think Don't Starve, where you build to survive, explore to build and survive to explore further) made the game absolutely barren.  There's a billion, a trillion planets. You'll visit 20 of them at best, and forget about 18 of them. One will be your homebase (which you'll never move from, there's no advantage for building multiple bases). 2 or 3 of the same type of planet will be enough for you to gather Resource Lvl 1, upgrade and go to the next type of planet to do the exact same with Resource Lvl 2. Dungeons are literally the same - same enemies, same structure, sometimes even the same  loot , dude. You've seen one of each type, you've seem them all. They threw in a story that requires you to explore to try and make you actually explore a planet, because as I've said, other than seeing dungeons/towns for the first time and perhaps nabbing their stuff, nothing presses you to explore.   Ores? Weapons? Cash? They will all pretty much just fall into your hands. Open Random Wooden Box #3 and you'll find some weapon with crazy DPS. Open Iron Chest #5, 3 manipulator modules, 200 pixels, etc. Sell your junk and you'll get rich (until the next fall damage-related death). Most quests are random, given by colonists who you make homes for, because for some reason they decided that fixed characters in the Outpost with fixed sidequests was a bad idea? And the rewards for quests are simply ridiculous, being either a manipulator module, some random weapon or whatever, and if you've done enough quests, the colonist becomes a worthless crew member who gets trapped on everything and dies within being 5 minutes on the planet. You don't even need to explore for materials for the best armor in the game - you can just stumble onto random merchants that SELL one of the best sets. They're expensive, but you'll be swimming in cash most of the time.  Combat is shoddy. For some reason the game lags as if you were playing on a server all the time - your character moves normally, but monsters and blocks take a second to appear/move/attack, making hits not count a lot of the time. You'll also get ganged on a lot, then try to run and die from fall damage. Fall damage which could have been mitigated with a tech (Bouncy Ball) that they decided to pull from the game and put nothing on it's place.   The EPP is a tragedy. Get a couple of bars, craft some mcguffins and you can make an upgrade that allows you to explore some new planets without any sense of accomplishment. It eats your augments - you can't take one back and swap it for another, if you put one in over another the first one is just lost forever, no matter how rare or expensive. Why?   Scenarios and a main story were a decent idea, but executed poorly simply by lack of content and by lack of effort. There are 8 (if you count the tutorial) maps where you aren't allowed to break or place anything (can't complain about that) and follow a linear path to a boss. They're pretty, but you won't do much other than kill the odd monster and press the odd button. Puzzles could have helped a lot, but mostly the story and aventure maps fall through on simply not having enough to do. You'll save the universe and kill the Ridiculously Powerful God-Killing Evil Entity in like, 5 hours.  Moons are just lifeless gas stations, supposedly 'dangerous' because of the spooky ghost, but you'll only get killed if you stay in place. I have no clue why barren planets are in the game, and asteroids now have no valuable resources. Why they kept the gateways coded in being that after the first 20 minutes you'll have a shortcut to the outpost/ark right on your ship (and the only thing the gateways do is take you back there) is beyond me.  Still, Starbound isn't a bad game. You'll have some fun, and if you like building just for the sake of building, there are many pretty blocks and objects to use and collect. Then you'll forget about it and play it again three months later when nothing else in your library looks interesting.   As a game developer, Chucklefish is a great publisher.   TL;DR: Procedural building and exploration game where building and exploration have no connection whatsoever. Devs realized that making procedural exploration just for the sake of being procedural is a bad idea way too late and put in a story, but it's weak as hell and the game shoves everything you need in your face without having you make any effort whatsoever.

Con's : - Becoming landowner and building a village for rent has the most mundane rewards imaginable. we built a town in a volcanic planet for the higher rewards there and we ended up with incredibly rare and low amounts of pixel payouts and absurd quantities of food, bandages, seeds, ... which didn't seem like much of a reward at all - Random planet generation isn't all that random with each terrain of planet having a gauranteed type of one civilization and slightly different organised village of said type of civilization (Floran, Apex, ...) you'll want to find a neutral and hostile type of each civilization - The main storyline quest is repetitive always following the same recipe: Scan 5-10 objects of the next race, then visit that race's capital in a special 5 minute mission.

If you want to buy the game anyway in hopes that the full version will be better, as someone who has followed development from day one, I think I can almost safely say that these people lack the means and direction to make it the great game they promised it to be, and it's flawed at its core.  I still kind of enjoy it, I wish it was better, I wish it was at least 10% of what they promised, and I have some hopes residing in the fact that after a bit of time after the game will be out of beta will have passed, the devs plan to hand it over to a b-team for constant updates, so there's a (still unsafe) bet for the game to express its full potential then I guess.  Too bad that at this pace we'll get to see the result of said coin flip in 2088.  Anyway, don't get me wrong: it's not like it has 0 content, but the core game is lacking and the devs have taken the abysmal path of trying to develop its basic features and at the same time try to release more pretty furniture and stuff that will get old fast to keep the fans pleased until '''release'''. Basically, they are hoping to buy time but in the process they are wasting time, progressing at a snail pace and showing multiple times that they are still unsure about the game's direction.  They still get at least a bit of my respect for being relatively new at this and aiming so high, but as of lately they seem like they have relaxed a lot, especially since they can just publish other games to sustain themselves (sounds familiar?).",

And the devs haven't even responded or handled the issue, because you can clearly tell they're burned out and equally unhappy with their awful game. You can expect maybe half a dozen patches and then this game will be abandoned, because it's terrible and the devs clearly don't care or have any passion left for it. I'm probably more passionately MAD about how bad this game is. As part of the botched 1.0 release the devs added Workshop mod support because they clearly expect the community to fix this disaster.  Hopefully everyone remembers the Starbound debacle well and avoids any future projects after Tiy and these devs jump ship.  Amazingly enough the game was so broken and mis-representing with false advertising that I was able to get a refund from Steam, so I never have to grimace or cringe through Starbound again.",

            "review_text": "Let's not kid ourselves, guys: The progression in this game basically stops after completing the first system and then just repeats itself until the end of the game. The first sword you built that was capable of dealing with Tier 1 enemies is going to have an almost identical version of it in the next crafting tier, as is every other piece of equipment. The enemies being randomized sounds cool and is as far as the sprite-mixing goes, but it really just results in a bunch of nice looking enemies with boring and mixed up attack patterns and pretty much guarantees that the planets in the next system aren't any more difficult outside of a fairly dull stat scaling. This randomness makes the game's progression dull and samey and creates most of the issues that make the game boring to play. Unlike Terraria, there aren't any dangerous and well planned out locations to explore that are tied to the game's progression; If you're lucky, you'll manage to get 6 hours out of it before seeing all the unique content. If you're luckier still, you won't have stuck around after that 6 hours trying in vain to find the cool, limitless content that the developers promised but never delivered on.  Here's to hoping that they fix it. They certainly could, and the game does have potential, but at this point it looks incredibly unlikely.  As of 1/2/2016: The above is still true. The game has been made *marginally* less boring through some additions to it's design, but it's still as bland as ever on the content end of things.  As of release: It's a little more bearable to play now but hey ~You'll never guess what still hasn't changed~!  I rate this game 2.5 out of 5 broken development promises.",

            "review_text": "From my personal experience thus far, I have concluded that there are two broadly inclusive categories of people who play Starbound: people with very low standards, and sexual deviants. Speaking as a person with relatively high standards, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game in its present state.  To begin with, the basics: Starbound is a side-scrolling crafting sandbox. From the presentation and gamefeel perspective, it's put together decently well. The graphics are charming, the items look nice, characters are cute, some of the tilesets and planet backgrounds are really well made, jumping and running and hitting things and being hit feels all good and proper - on that front, I really have no complaints. The interface is a little ♥♥♥-backwards - it took me a while to figure out exactly how to use items from the inventory, and various functions that could have been assigned key bindings are instead done through tedious mouse movement and clicking (to give an example, in order to assign items to quick use slots, you must click on them in your inventory and drag them to the slot in question. I would have preferred to simply hover over them with my mouse and press the quick slot's key in order to instantly reassign. It seems so incredibly obvious that I do it every time before I realize that the developers hadn't thought of this and I must instead waste my time with this piddly cockamamie bull ♥♥♥♥. I'm sure you're wondering - they do it that way so that you can still quick swap while your inventory is open and your mouse is on it, right? Well, you'd be wrong. They do it because they're bad at making games. If there is an item held in your cursor (which is the only reason you'd ever open your inventory) the quick swap keys just do not work.)  My second major complaint is with the performance - for what it is, this game runs like grandma's ♥♥♥. Stuttering and FPS drops are common even on screens which don't have a whole lot going on. It feels like the only time I hit 60 is when I'm deep underground, with no other entities within the immediate area and only a single light source. On big colonies with a decent number of characters, sub-20 is common. Bear in mind that this is a 2D side-scroller and I'm running a 390. And this doesn't even have the excuse of Dwarf Fortress, which calculates the anal circumference and life aspirations of every character in the universe every time someone takes a step.  What breaks this game for me, however, is the gameplay. To begin with, it's all good and fun. You dig deep, collect ores, build stuff, upgrade your old stuff. The starting world plays just like you'd expect of a game of this genre. Once you reach a certain point, you're ready to fix your marooned ship and go to other worlds. On the other worlds, you make a beeline for the ore that you couldn't get on the previous planet in order to ascend to the next tier of equipment that immediately eliminates all challenge from your present surroundings. You repeat this three more times and then the challenge is gone from the game as you acquire the highest tier of gear that makes any combat encounter in the game an utter joke. Once you've gotten the highest tier of stuff, likewise, there is no reason to continue exploring, as your reasons for doing it thus far (getting better stuff) will have evaporated.  There are other aspects, as well - you can build colonies, which consist of you building nice homes for people who will give you money in exchange for taking your fps. They will be altogether happy with plain old rectangles made of dirt bricks and a lightbulb each, but any player of such games will naturally surround their plain dirt rectangles with grand architectural monuments of immense scale suitable as to impress their grubby proles. If you're anything like me, by this point in the game your exploration of other worlds will be driven mainly by your desire to acquire new furniture for your home base, as if you were some sort of savage space pirate from a race of honourable and warlike interior decorators. After a while, however, it becomes evident that there's not really a point to the whole colony system - you can contribute more effort, but you don't really get anything in return, your tenants continue to behave entirely like bumble ♥♥♥♥ idiots that just stumble and wander all over your nice place, and it becomes clear that nothing of risk or consequence will ever happen involving your colony.  As I've mentioned, there's exploration, too, but once you've reached the top tier, the only thing that reaching some new tileset or setpiece will give you is the inherent satisfaction of seeing a new tileset or setpiece. You have no way of interacting with inhabitants or environments outside of dismantling, trading and whatnot, and nothing of consequence can happen as a result of your exploration - you don't learn new stories (unless you pick up a book somewhere, in which case the story will be rather short and not very well written), you don't get new things to do, and any sense of intrigue or mystery that might blossom is immediately crushed by the shallowness of the mechanics. There's very little in the sense of player stories, by which I mean when a player goes 'oh man I went to X planet and found this dude who told me Y so I went and did Z where Φ happened and it turns out that Λ was the case all along.' You know, the narratives that players create naturally as a result of interpreting events in the game. This is because there are only three things that happen in the game - killing a thing with your overpowered weapon, picking up or dropping furniture and terrain with your magic matter gun, and watching cutscenes. Other actors or the unseen game director lack agency entirely and have no power to complicate or interfere with your experience, making the game BORING. In fact, the only stories are those told by the devs through cutscenes, which are boring because every player will see the exact same thing, in which they're not able to participate in the same way as with emergent player stories.  There is a story, by the way. You have to collect the six chaos emeralds in order to seal away the ancient evil that wants to kill everyone. That is figuratively it. This game doesn't need a story. It needs threats and challenges and things that can happen, new mechanics and random events. If not that, then at least something that can breathe some new life into the cycle of dig - fight - collect - upgrade - repeat, like, say, an endgame. Until the issues I've listed are addressed, I strongly recommend that you AVOID this game unless you can pick it up for $5 or $10 or however much you think is fair for an OKish crafting sandbox with an extremely short expiry date.",

Nearly any good aspect of the game I can think of is accompanied by a major drawback. Here's just some examples off the top of my head;  Procedural quests abound! :D but hardly any quests in the outpost D:  New storyline :D that has no impact whatsoever on the rest of the universe D:  Crew members :D with practically no customization (and arguably next to no individuality) D:  Procedural monsters :D 'oh look, this one's blue this time...' D:  A decently wide variety of weaponry to choose from :D you'll only ever use that one two handed sword you found three literal days ago D:  That's not even mentioning the performance issues that so many people, myself included, have encountered playing this game. I literally got 15 max FPS during the credits.  In my opinion there's no real reason to play the game again as one of the other races if you've already beat it once. The only thing that will truly be different is your ship and the planets you fly it to. Everything else is practically identical, and that's one of the bigger concerns I've seen over space exploration games (to be topical, it was a major concern about No Man's Sky when they started talking about it months ago)  Do I think Starbound has potential? Yes, and it has a lot of it! Would I recommend this game now in its current state? Only if you aren't afraid of disappointement. And yeah, you could probably still get a good 20 hours out of the game at least (not including time spent during other versions of the game), but after that there isn't anything to do unless you mod it.",

            "review_text": "Got the game on pre-order waaaaay back in the day, played it a bit at the time. When I eventually got tired of all the instability and frequent world-wipes and unfinished content (as there does tend to be in early-alpha builds, so no grudge there), I put it away so I could see with fresh eyes what it would look like when it was finally 'ready'.  First, some positives:  *The game does feel a lot more purposeful now with its over-arching story than it did way back in the early days. It also has a decent (if not exactly great) sense of humour.  *The tutorial mission is a nice intro to the controls (but badly needs to be optionally skippable).   *Lots of stuff to build with (if you can scrape together the pixels to buy it or the blueprints to craft it). The possibilities for base-building are probably the game's strongest point.  *The graphics are still nice, while the soundtrack is full of overly-catchy 'ear-worms' (although many are really not very appropriate for the overall atmosphere of the game itself: 'You've just stumbled into a giant eerie cavern made of packed bones and tar-pits... let's play a cheerful little piano-ditty over that!').  *The addition of the outpost provides a nice mission-hub (although things are placed much too far apart and ultimately there's just not enough utility provided by it all).  *The addition of the various official 'collections' is on the right track (but still feels a bit half-baked and incomplete).   *I still enjoy trying to gather together as many different crops as possible in a comprehensive megafarm (though the food system in general is about equal parts fun and frustration).  -=-=-  You may have noticed that even most of the positives have major qualifications attached to them. Yet, all that said, I am seriously shocked at how user-unfriendly the game remains after, what is it, almost 5 solid years now (!) of supposed 'beta-testing'. It's even more shocking given the (inevitable) example of Terraria standing right there beside it the entire time, showing plainly how to do stuff right for anyone who cared to look. Here are just a few things that I can't believe didn't get fixed ages ago:  *Making storymission-progress with friends in multiplayer will make it impossible for you to complete the same story-missions in your single-player world without going into admin mode and cheating them completed!! Blizzard handled single/multiplayer progression in Diablo 1 and 2 almost flawlessly nearly 20 years ago, yet this bug is apparently longstanding and doesn't seem likely to be fixed anytime soon.  *The controls are still clunky as hell, with too many important functions (hunting/farming/watering/healing/blockbuilding) being made dependent on too few equipment-slots. The item-handedness is pointless and just makes the problem worse. At least let us make something like a 'farming build' with a hoe in one hand and watering-can in the other, since there is absolutely no reason a hoe needs to be '2-handed.' Or better yet, just make all those basic functions passively available if you simply have the appropriate item somewhere in your inventory.  *Movement-control is way too sloppy and loose for a game where a wrong move can easily send you falling off a mountain or down a pit to your death, resulting in the scattering of almost everything you happen to be carrying at the time. And of course when you die you not only drop all your healing items but also all the materials you need to make more of them, so unless you have a big stockpile squirreled away at all times, have fun grinding up a bunch more of those every time you need to go retrieve your fallen loot, lest you finally make it back only to be immediately killed again by whatever got you last time. Wheeeee!  *Bad controls are made even worse by the amount of inventory management you need to do using an inventory-system that makes it almost impossible to do anything else while the window is open. Depending on your resolution, non-scaling item tooltips will happily pop up with the single bit of useful information sitting off-screen unless you either move the whole inventory window higher or shift the item you're interested into a higher row of the inv screen (I'm thinking here of the rottenness-status of food items, where it is all too easy not to notice just how far-gone something is until your nice meal suddenly turns into a puddle of green goo).  I could go on (and on and on). All of these things might sound like pretty minor quibbles, and individually it would probably be easy to get used to any one or two of them, but all taken together they paint a strange picture of a dev-team that either still doesn't actually know what 'fun' is, or has a seriously warped definition of it.   Either way, Starbound remains a basically-promising game that, after nearly half a decade of work, still isn't nearly what it was promised to be, and basically just not much fun. Maybe I'll check it out again in 2021.",

It has lots of content, cool building mechanics, lots of adenture and things to see, and overall a good narritive storyline. Controls, Sounds, Effects and Workshop content is incredible. And just honestly love the game.  Now the reasons why the game frustrates me and makes me have to dislike it. And that is the Cooperative hosting and connections to play with friends. Invalids/Errors and Dedicated Issues that create lags and unable to connect with others. I bought this game specifically to play with friends, but this game in all of my attempts have failed for me to play along with others. And I don't care, 'You have to punch in their IP's' use programs such as Hamachi or Evolve Client, or 'Open Ports' for your dedicated server. I know this, tried it and has not worked well, also to add to that I should not have to struggle to do all of that to play with my friends in this simple little game. And for the life of me I been having the hardest times trying to play with my friends when I do try these things, and I get the endless loading icon, or clientserver errors or worse if we do get together the game lags feverishly. And me and my friends should not have to go through all of these hoops to just play together for a couple hours, and not have rely or configure to go through all of these 3rd programs or inputs just to play with everyone to have that Co-op experience. The Workshop content also interferes when wanting to play together, so than we have to subscribe to the worshops contents, or when they become glitched or outdated that to can cause problems to host and join eachother's games. And everytime I host or join it is always some kind of issue with this game.   This is definitely a major issue in my opinion that needs to be done for this game. And I even posted several times on the Forums how this stuff is too complicating or can't join servers and got no professional responses at all. So until this is fixed the game is a lonely solo adventure. Cause so far the Cooperative experiences I wanted when I bought this game originally has now become downright frustrating. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed so it's simple to join eachother's games just like they did with Terraria. Good game! Bad Server hosting.",

I shouldn't say there's nothing there, i should say that everything in this game means nothing.  Adventuring - Nothing is there that you want or would need. You only need to adventure to find colonies where you left click on everything or get extremely boring and monotonous quests of sending you on a wild goose chase to get to the fun parts of the game which last around 1 hour each quest and there's 6 of them. So i've spent roughly 14 hours adventuring and i've only gotten 1 hour of actually fun content from it. Great game right?  Building - This game does give you one thing though, and that's cosemetics and blocks. Both of them are useless. Cosemetics don't add anything truly substantial to the game and the blocks are just useless. Lets put it this way, they give you an infinite number of worlds to 'adventure' in. By that, i mean an infinite number of rocks in space that mean nothing to you after you leave them. Sure you can build on them but what does it matter? they're forcing you to fly from planet to planet anyways. You can't stay on one planet at all. So you must be able to build on something right? You need a base. Well they give you one for free that automatically expands itself. You can't expand it though and there's almost no room for any fun building to be done. You HAVE to build your crafting stations and storage in the ship, you literally cannot make anything cool or substantial in the small base that they give you. It's been 17 hours and i've only gotten one expansion to it.  Quests - The quests are mainly the only game you'll find. But the only fun quests are hard to find or they're the main story quests. Imagine WoW's quests... now take away every ounce of fun and effort from them and make the reward a dog turd. You made a starbound quest. They're short, boring, and do nothing but give you money to eventually buy a new weapon that's replaced by an item from the main story quest anyways. Now this 'main story quest' is not only where you find your items but it's the only motivation for playing this game. Basically, they're quests where you get sent on a wild goose chase for colonies where you have to adventure around on planets, which gets boring really fast, and you pray to god that you didn't waste 10 mintues on another planet. Once you finally finish the first part of the main story quest, you get sent to a fun dungeon. The items were great, the dungeon was fun, the enemies were challenging but not impossible and it was something new. Then it ends after around 30 minutes to 1 hour. And if the story is correct, you do this 5 more times, and then fight the final boss.    TL;DR - The game is fun, if it allows itself to. There is fun in the game but it's hidden under hours and hours of monotonous, tedious, boring, lifeless, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ quests which give you nothing. You can adventure, but there's nothing gained form it. You can mine but there's nothing gained from it. You can do quests but they're boring. The only thing fun is the main story quest, but that can be boring also. I just can't recommend this game after taking 17 hours to have around 2 hours of decent content. It's just not good. It doesn't matter what game there is or what i missed, if i played and did almost every aspect of the game for 17 hours and finished a sixth of the main quest, i should have gotten somewhere or had fun at some point. If i've missed something 'fun' then tell me, I really want to enjoy this game, but it's a huge disappointment as of now.",

It's lagbound.  still a good game tho  As for an actual review, it's a good game, but it's missing a few things:  Spaceship combat. I love the regular combat, but you have a huge spaceship, right? It can't be just used for moving around. Why not use it to shoot things?  Invasions. Say you have a lovely settlement and everyone is happy, and then all of a sudden a group of douches decide to raid your settlement. This should be a randomly timed event, with the invaders teleporting in. During a raid rent is not available and if not properly dealt with, a few items will disappear.  Enhanced conversation. There are people I want to talk to about their feelings (say my depressed spook addict Kem is shedding a single tear) and I think we should have different dialogue choices.  References. Every good game is bound to have a few references- if there are I haven't found any. I desperately want to see some.    I'd love to see some references to Terraria because of the similarities!     Old survival mechanics. The older version of the game had a few more advanced mechanics for survival: staying warm and such. I'm sure some of us would like to see this brought back.  More graphical control. Some of us are playing on ♥♥♥♥♥♥ laptops and are probably getting 10 FPS: I feel the pain of having low frames too, there's too much AI jesus I think we should have the ability to toggle certain things off, such as certain brighting mechanics reducing it to blocks. This would help with frames.  Reduced fall damage. god, that thing is so ♥♥♥♥ING UNFORGIVABLE  Better AI and harder enemies. Honestly combat is so easy and I'd like to see enemies actually try to kill me.  Reduced AI storage robbing. My game lags too much when I have at least more than ten people or passive animals on screen at once; perhaps some nonused mechanic deletion would help.  Remove the passive AI's ability to close doors. I don't know how many ♥♥♥♥ing times a citizen has closed the door in my DAMN FACE  Reduced crafting times. May as well alt-tab and write this review while i'm waiting for my 1000 copper ores to finish refining.  Easier pet health restoration. So you have to reduce a monster's health to capture them? Well now I have to gather a ♥♥♥♥ton of materials I could put to better use to restore my pet's health. I'd also like to see and increase in pet health and usefulness.  Less hassle. I've completely sidetracked from the story to play freely so I don't have to waste my damn time trying to find ♥♥♥♥ to scan.  Quest watching control. I want the ability to mark quests to never track and automatically track new ones. I'm sick and tired of that damn bar.  Reduced enemy damage. So I'm exploring a world that's marked 'Dangerous' and then I take 50 damage from some slime. Are you kidding me?  Better planet/system searching. Right now we only have the coordinates but I want to search for the names of the systems. Please add this.  Better multiplayer. I'm not even going to describe this.  Bug fixes. No, no, no no no the bug net is fine  Less crashing. It seems like I have to start the game twice (♥♥♥♥ING TWICE and it happens when i'm doing something important) to actually start it. It's like a ♥♥♥♥ed car engine trying to run.  That's all the features I want for now; as you can see there's a lot. I wish there was a 'Neutral' option for a rating but since there is none, I'll have to go with a dislike. Chucklefish, please update your game with new things instead of forcing us to mod it, okay?

What i doesn't like/hated - Scan objects, it is the biggest turn off for me, especially you're required to do it for many of it's core missions.  - Hotbar is a mess, counter intuitive and unexplained.  - Performance is extremely bad, even on my i7 machine with 24GB of RAM, and Fury X GPU, the game manage to run below 20fps most of the time even when standing still.  - The UI is really bad, so unfriendly and messy.  - The missions are so repetitive and without clear indications on how to finish them.

Win64 is still not operational and the game overall still suffers from performance problems. Other issues mentioned are otherwise unamended.  ---Original 1.0.2 Review--- Wow, so I actually enjoyed this game up until now. What a shame.  I wrote a postive review for this game back during early access. Back then, the crafting trees, survivability elements, mod ability, and the diversity of monsters, bosses, and locations was quite expansive, dynamic, and very interesting. You never knew what to expect and it took a lot of time and effort to make your way up the upgrade tree.  The latest versions of the game are laughable in comparison. This is a game that has CUT CONTENT AND FEATURES as it MOVED FORWARD in development, and I don't really mean it's moved forward. The year or so has been nothing more than a downgrade for the game than any actual improvement. The game has been losing content yet it has been running worse. But hey at least prior to 1.0, the game LAUNCHED, and now it is a complete non-responsive, broken, buggy hunk of programming.  It's absolutely appauling to see a game like this sink so far so fast. The devs clearly did not take community feedback or experiences into account and we have this mediocre product serving as a shell of what was a really enjoyable game. It's a shining example of everything wrong with early access and sadly another wasted investment of time and money.  I really hope the modding community is committed enough to bail this game out.

Today, its changed quite a lot and barely resembles the roughly stitched-together version it used to be, but it still kept it's heartwarming adorableness and liveliness. I am so glad to finally see it reach it's complete stage, and that these developers stuck to the fans and delivered what they wished for. You got my respect chucklefish.  The game combines crafting, mining for resources, building, combat, farming, exploration, awesome and deep storyline and fleshed out characters. The best part is that you can choose what you want to do. Boss/tech/ship/planet tiers are not very closely tied together, so you could choose a single path rather than all of them at once.   Mods- This game always had mods, but now that there is steam mod support, meaning you can upload and download any mod you want with ease and not risk downloading malware. speaking of steam, they also recently implemented steam server hosting, so you can play with your friends and not have server admins boss you around.   Definetly an adorable and memorable game. Games like these will be like the old nintendo games of today in 30 years. People will talk about starbound being a great game that isn't just entertaining but inspires and touches all the fans.   Chucklefish is a developing team that deserves some great respect. Their team may be small, but they have achieved so much while still providing for the fans. They never lied about their products (Ahem, No Man's Sky.) and their products are well worth the price.   Bottom line: Easily one of the best games out there in my opinion. If you liked minecraft, terraria, or any side scrolling or sci-fi game, this is a must have.

You can cook diverse food recipes and you need to eat to stay alive in 2 out of 3 of the difficulty levels.  - You can dual weild weapons, and use combinations like a 1-handed sword with a gun.

I like the weapon diversity and secondary abilities. The music is also top notch.. But most of all, like the idea of the game. I however do not like the way it was executed. ___ I had to give this a positive rating simply for how much time I've gotten out of the money spent. However, the quality of that 'game time' is much less than it's competition. The game has an excessive amount of quirks to it's design, and not good ones. Most of the design choices go against your intuition; from the way the UI is laid out and interracted with, the lack of hotkeys, the way items are equipped/unequipped, the list goes on. Industry standard controls (Like shift-clicking an item in your inventory to equip it) are blatantly ignored, whether by design choice or more likely inexperience.. It really is depressing.  Even at 1.0, it all feels thrown together. Most components lack cohesion. An alarming amount of items are obsolete from the moment you're able to craft them. The universe all feels the same (because it is) and there's only about 5 or 6 planets worth visiting. I could keep going but I'll stop there.",

I was one of those idiots saying that it is just Terraria in space and a massive Terraria rip-off which was bad because you could be naked in it. I played it a bit, saw that it really wasn't like that, and ended up playing a character to the endgame armor and gear, along with defeating the bosses to progress. After that, I stopped playing the game for a few months, eventually un-installing it. I had then heard that there was an update, so I installed it a second time and started playing, just to see that I hated everything they had changed. This was a turnoff for my at the time, so I left it again. A week later, however, curiosity got the best of me and I started playing it again. I found myself enjoying it even more than the previous version of it. It was that time where I got my first 100 hours into Starbound, starting to play it more and more, waiting for updates. After a few months, Starbound 1.0 was announced and the hype-train left the station. Once 1.0 was finally out, I started to play the game even more than before, adding another 200 hours to it. With 300 hours, I can safely say that I reccomend this game to anybody who wants a fun and enjoyable space game where you explore caves, stab stuff to death, and get loot for it, while trying to prevent the end of the very universe at the hands of this cult and their mysterious leader, while being helped by a friendly Human at the Outpost's Ark, which will be joined by others to aid your quest as you complete the game.",

Did the minimum requirements change when I wasn't looking? No..., then why can't I run a map properly? Game acts like someone forgot to check memory management, but in truth, I don't know what's wrong. My PC makes and beats recomended stats, so this should be fluid gameplay right?! God I wan't to change this review so badly. 1.0 really kicked the bucket. Wait untill they've had time and reason to fix it.  Edit: July 26, 2016 They droped a patch today that seems to be helping a great deal, but the problem persists. Too soon to change the review, but enough to state that the developers are infact working on the issue and working quickly. This will likely be a temporary review.  Edit:August 4,2016 Change  Lag reliability has inproved signigicantly, almost to the point it was when I first started the beta. Much still to be worked on, but the game is playable.  On to a more reliable (and usable) review, now that lag isn't killing the game outright; Starbound is in the same catagory as Minecraft and Terraria. The spacific differences of note would be 2D style side scrolling play, a trans server hub (your ship), multiple world to play across, and a lively number of options within the games compatable mods. Though there use to be more to do, rebalancing the games core engine required the temporary removal of many items and concepts, most slated to be returned to play after debuging. With a lively modding comunity and active forms and servers, this game is sure to last a good while, regardless of developer activity. Still, the dev team has made significant progress and the more frequent updates promiss even more progress to come. Like Minecraft, this game may never actually finish developing, providing players reason enough to keep coming back for more.",

Sure some aspects of the game doesn't appeal to me (like the inventory system for example and a pretty frustating questline at times) but overall this is a pretty addicting game. There's always something to do even if you ignore the main story (after a certain point of course). Some tried to compare this to Terraria but this is a completely different game. It feels different (not just Terraria in Space). Only if we can combine these 2 games... ANYWAY if you have the patience (if you're kinda hooked like me it doesn't really matter i guess) this is a pretty relaxing and can be a good alternative if you played Terraria and need something a bit different in the overall feel of the game. And if you're able to get comfortable with it it's a great fun! But before you go buy this game just remember you need some patience and some curiousity to actually enjoy this to it's full potential. Also don't get easily discouraged because it's not 'a walk in the park' kind of first impression (for me at least). It's going to get rough out there.",

The artwork is pretty nice however despite the larger resolution I found the armor in the game to be somewhat dull.   Starbound is a pretty short game, despite the slog of getting off the first planet which takes a while, much more so if it's your first time playing with no idea what to do. Overall I would say it takes 4 hours or so to beat the game if you don't stop to sort your inventory or build stuff. But that's the thing about starbound, building stuff is where it's at.  The main storyline in the game is alright but short. The progression itself seems pretty good but a bit rushed near the end. I managed to skip the second last armor set and craft the best armor possible within 20 minutes of accessing the final tier of planets. The combat is somewhat interesting with the dual wield aspect, but it's still not quite as interesting or even really as difficult as terraria. I never died once to any of the bosses in the main storyline. As long as you have up to date armor and healing items it's a cakewalk.  Starbound is fun because you can check out all these cool planets and build whatever you like on them. With a sizeable selection of furniture objects you can make quite a bit of neat looking things.  However, I like starbound, but terraria is still better in nearly every aspect, that includes building. Terraria still has a ridiculous amount of content in comparison, and while starbound has mods it feels like the developers want to rely too heavily on mods for content. I mean starbound has only a bunch of recolored speeder bikes and a boat as usable vehicles, I didn't find anything else. I thought there were mechs and other stuff too. I couldn't find any of this stuff.  Basically if the idea of going to a bunch of different planets and building colonies and bases entices you way more than an highly tuned and challenging boss progression system with lots of loot, then starbound might be for you.",

Let's keep note that I've sunk about 200 hours into this game, 'completed' it twice, and am quite fervorously into the modding community (If fervorously a word? Ah well.)  PROS •A comprehensive GUI and crafting system makes the game very easy to get around in •A full 'Technology' advancement system based on improving existing tables rather than making new ones •Movement reminiscent of games such as Terraria and other sandbox-platformers makes a familiar scheme. •An upgrade system for your infinitive mining device •An energy system that handles both guns and magic, allowing for diverse gameplay •A developer base geared to the community, to the point of going through the pain of integrating the Workshop for mods •An exceedingly diverse building assortment, from planks and bricks to solid flesh and blood •A large assortment of 'Things to do' from making a settlement to collecting every bug in the universe •A crew to take with you on expeditions and hunts - If you've the time to hire them •A tech system that's more comprehensive than punching wood   Now, naturally, as with any good game, there's a fair share of cons, that many would see as features to 'add difficulty' This is   MY OPINION  and   MY OPINION ONLY   so don't get upset if you disagree. I'm completely open to debate, mind you, if you've reasoning to back it up.   SomeGremlin Said  Your opinion sucks, I think it's great. Screw you.  That's not a valid argument. This shouldn't need to be cleared up, but just in case- this is the internet.  CONS •The difficulty of finding appealing building material is phenomenal. I still need that stupid floran carving.. •This is a spoiler, ye been warned    The absurdity of the 'Item Scan' missions is rediculous, Esther.   •The temptation to cheat is always looming, as it's as simple as a single command and there's no penalty for it. •The 'Immobility' of the player is rediculous as well, as you need a hoverbike to really get exploring.  •Fall damage is very forgiving, throwing yourself off of a cliff and pulse jumping at the last second negates the challenge. •The difficulty slope at the beginning is quite looming, and then later it's just too  easy . •The shops around the universe can be quite useless unless you need that sugar for your cake, or that super spin slash. •Honestly, who needs to go beyond the third mission if you're not focussed on 'Beating' the game? In other words, we need more reward for going through the pain of scanning randomly generated structures, and that makes it so hollow. •While having a crew is nice, they really don't do much off the ship, and they get themselves killed so much.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but I haven't played it since a week after its release. I've lost most interest in it.  Seriously though, Starbound is a great game, and if you don't have it by now, you should.  Though, there are a few problems:  The story is too long for my taste. I took 20 hours on it (a bit of cheating as well ;3) and am still only halfway to the end. Kudos to the people who are quicker than I.  The villagers don't really have use except for rent and asthetics. They only say one sentence for the rest of their life. ONE SENTENCE, no matter how weird that sentence is!  You would think since there are farm animals and a way to get money from them, they would be useful. Don't make me laugh. 10,000 pixels later, I only got a 100 pixel profit.  The planets are all different, but exactly the same. There are so many orange blob monsters. SO MANY. Thanks, diversity.  The story NPCS are okay at best. I felt kind of into the story, but the whole farming mishap killed my interest.  It's been how long? And as of November, I still haven't played the game since it's week of release.  Now, you may be wondering why I am recommending Starbound to you. Sometimes I wonder that myself, but it is a good game. See, my time with this game has come to a close. I don't really know how to describe this well, but after a bit on the 1.0 release (and being one of the forefathers- foremothers?- in achievement gaining), it felt like I was replaying a game I have already played many times over. And, though kind of crazy, that farm thing really did turn me off from Starbound.  Anyway, this game is meant for a new generation or Starbounders who never played the pre-release. You kids have fun; us older people will sit on the porch bench, looking longingly at a sky with two moons saying, 'I was like that once'.  Also, be aware of those freaking orange blobs. 90% of my rage has come because of them in the beginning. DIE, YOU STUPID ORANGE MUCUS, DIE  I now have a seperate way to farm, it's called Stardew Va- Wait, what do you mean it's published by the same company. How could Chucklefish be so good and terrible at farming logic at the SAME TIME?  WHHHHYYYYY",

Their is always a feel of adventure and the wanting to explore more of this Universe. They are many different features in this game besides space travel that this game offers. This game can offer more than No Man Sky ever could! Their is questing, crews, pets (more like pokemon), armor, weapons,colonizing, and so much more! Their is even a rich storyline.

The main story quest was normalized across all races.  In fact, all races were completely normalized. No more racial bonuses or anything- it's purely cosmetic.  Even star types and biome appearances were normalized. There's no reason to explore beyond your local cluster, as new and interesting star types are a thing of the past.  You will fight the same monsters over and over. On every planet. There is nothing 'unique' anymore.  All and all, the apologistic community and the uninspired devs have destroyed what was once an incredibly promising game.

Combat is very improved from the previous weapon choices of gun, sword, slightly bigger sword, and explosive; the most effective of them all. Vehicles are pretty fun to ride around the planetside. The story is actually a story instead of a large string of loosely related quests, now. Monster generation is more streamlined to allow for uniquely named and designed enemies of all kinds for every playthrough. You can have an NPC crew on your ship so you and your pet aren't the only passengers. Settlements are pretty great from what I've experienced, although I haven't done much.

            "review_text": "Starbound is the 2D Minecraft everyone said Terraria was.  So Starbound is finally out after 2 1/2 years and was it worth the wait? Yeah I'd say so.  SB is basically a game about exploring the universe gathering resources, crafting blocks, weapons, armour, getting powerful enough to defeat the beast that destroyed earth, or just ignoring all that and building a colony that you can call home.  You have 7 races you can play as: Humans, Avians, Apex, Floran, Glitch, Hyltol and Novakids, which don't function differently ingame besides looks, and their ship.  SB has a story mode that outside the very first mission (to repair your ship) is completely ignorable, you can progress without needing to play through the story.  The main strength though in SB is about the building and the journeys you can embark on, you can create houses and plop down a colony deed to attract tenants which will pay their rent with Pixels (Cash) or an assortment of items, The tenants will have quests to give as well which are randomly generated, though you can expect to see the same kinds of quests over and over (Save this person, Kill these meanies, Make a chair for me, Threaten my roommate at knife point, etc).  Help someone enough and they'll like you so much that they'll be willing to join your crew, who can beam down onto planets with you to help out, or just hang around on the ship, being able to help out with a specialisation (They could be a chemist who gives out buffs in the battlefield, A Soldier/ Outlaw who will protect you with their lives, though not all specialisations are related to combat). Or if that doesn't sound good to you, just hire a bunch of penguin mercenaries to get the job done.  There are hundreds if not thousands of block types and decorative items that you can create almost anything how you'd like, with the ability to unlock a paint and wiring tool that allow you to further customise how your base looks and functions.  The story consists of 6 premade missions to embark on, all centred on the different races (excluding Novakids) on a journey to collect all the artifacts to square off against the behemoth you nearly got destroyed by at the beginning of the game.  Building and exploring multiple unique planets is the main emphasis of the game, which you can tell by the combat because it isn't the best, it's functional and can even be quite fun at times but it's not going to be the main reason you play, it's fairly standard with 1 handed items that you can mix and match to create a unique fighting style or you can use 2 handed guns/ swords/spears/ hammers that have random special abilities depending on the weapon type, along with unique weapons that you can find from story missions, chests, and as rewards that are always the same but have special out there abilities and attacks way different from any other weapon.  You can also use basic farming to grow your own food and resources, protect animals you get from the Terramarket to get produce from them which you can sell to shopkeeps or directly to Terramarket for profit, you can then use money to buy ores from the local miners instead of getting it yourself, albeit at a high cost.  The game has gorgeous pixel art, that is seriously some of the best I think I've ever seen (especially in the environments), it has a outstanding Soundtrack that always keeps you up during your treks and gets you pumped up for combat when it happens, the OST is absolutely worth purchasing if nothing else.  Did this game have the perfect Early Access? No.  Does it still need some work ? Yeah in certain areas (with promised free content updates coming this issue could easily be addressed)  Is Starbound a good game? Yep.",

I was excited to get in early because I somewhat enjoyed Terraria before I started using Linux, and I thought it would be neat to watch a game grow, especially since I had followed Minecraft since indev, I guess I just expected more stability than there has been.  Not only is the game abhorrently slow even to this day, but character wipes have claimed several handfuls of hours of my time, with nothing but minor changes to show for it. The game crashes often, and prides itself on a simplistic modding element using Lua, which is probably the one thing they didn't ♥♥♥♥ up, because Lua works so well.   I made a huge mistake by supporting these developers, and it's a mistake I will not make twice.  The game has decent artwork and decent sound design, and a consistently thorough yet minimalist future-y theme. It's a real shame to be honest, because I can't sit down and play it without thinking about what could have been.  UPDATE:  Several YEARS after this review, I decided to try the game out again, in the new year spirit. It's still a massive piece of ♥♥♥♥, the interface has gotten significantly worse, and the game feels slightly sluggish but not as much as it used to be. Since all the wipes that erased my progress before, I played for about an hour before I realized I still don't give a ♥♥♥♥ about playing a Chucklefish game anymore.  Still don't recommend.",

            "review_text": "  Starbound got an update, everyone panic    Starbound is infamous for staying docile for a long, long time, but with the 1.0 update bringing promising content, I think it's a solid time to renew our reviews, and cover Starbound at its current state. Keep in mind this is covering content up to major content update 1.0.    Gameplay    Gameplay has you moving across the galaxy in your little ship, exploring new planets with a variety of strange creatures and flora to discover. Starbound's impressive and large starmap allows players to find all kinds of randomly-generated planets which they can explore to the fullest extent. Jumping on to the planets, players find themselves in a side scrolling game, mixing in the qualities of adventure as you find NPCs and ancient dungeons, and throwing in the aspects of mining and resource gathering from the undergrounds. The amount of content is fairly massive, with NPCs giving you side quests, to much more large scale platformer-esque dungeons that you navigate through for loot. You feel rewarded for exploring, and you find yourself getting lost in the vast expanses of the galaxy, something that I personally, absolutely love. New weapons, gear, and ores are given at a steady pace and you never feel like you're underequipped unless you deliberately rush the game, something you really shouldn't do. This is what Starbound excels at doing. Giving the player a great experience with exploration.  Unfortunately, Starbound suffers from floaty, almost slippery controls that make you wanna jam your keyboard into your ear. It's very difficult to manuever on particularly precise platforms and you'll find yourself taking fall damage a lot. There are upgrades for your character that are somewhat early-game that allow you to double jump and nulify the awfulness of the controls but even then, it hurts to do anything with accuracy.   Building and combat are both very hit-or-miss things. Combat is interesting, I suppose, with the multitude of weaponry that you'll be able to find, but can get boring unless you're fighting one of few bosses that are strewn out your quest line. Similarly, building can be a lot of fun with how many blocks and furniture items you can find, but do require you to find those items first, something that requires a lot of searching since certain planets with certain conditions house certain dungeons with certain items.   Overall, the gameplay is more then palpable, but does require a lot of getting used to and are finicky.    Progression    I should probably cover progression in this game since, for a sandbox game, a quest line of any kind seems like some kind of disgusting heresy. The progression in this game comes in the form of quests that you can do at any time. You're not really forced to do any of the story line quests, since they don't really lock out anything in particular, but they are encouraged. The quests themselves are fairly linear (no block breaking, almost purely combat and NPC chatting), which might displease some of the more open-minded players. It's certainly not bad, but a bit strangely designed.    Graphics    Most definitely a beautiful game. From the stellar treetops of a jungle planet to the vast beauty of the ocean seafloor, Starbound is able to deliver you an excellently sprited game experience that features color and variety. It's honestly what makes the Starbound experience so wonderful.    Performance    ...Unfortunately those beautiful graphics also lead into the performance issues that seem to plague players. I can, personally, run this game at a solid 60 FPS at all times, but many of the less fortunate players find themselves getting lag spikes and painful framerate drops. This isn't helped by the less then stellar options menu which doesn't really help you much on keeping the performance issues down. Be wary of this, it can be unplayable due to the lack of optimization.    Potential    This is something that is almost necessary to speak out on for an Early Access game, especially one like Starbound. I love Starbound's atmosphere and concept, and the developers are certainly working with that to make a wonderful game. However, the gameplay mechanics themselves are less then stellar. With that being said, the game is still a lot of fun. I see a lot of potential in it, not from just the developers, but from the game's heart itself. If the devs continue working on it as they've been doing, it might just have a chance of really becoming something special.    Overall    At it's current state and price, Starbound is worth it. It's a fun adventure game that combines the magic of discovering something new, with the enjoyment of progressing through a variety of worlds with unique weapons and items. Build, kill, do whatever. The galaxy is yours in Starbound. Buy it, preferably with friends (It even has the four pack option!).   Hope to see more players bound for the stars.   See you space cowboy.

I've been waiting for it to launch out of beta to make a review because I knew it would be the most complete then. Starbound, from the outside, looks a lot like terraria right? Well from the inside of the game it has multiple features that terraria doesn't such as, choosing a race, infinite universe to explore, planets, stars, moons, and arcade games. This game is great and it has very few flaws those flaws including, slightly buggy multiplayer from time to time, and very, very rare crashes.  Long story short  Pros -Highly Explorable -High Replayability -Great Soundtrack -Some Nice Graphics (For a 2D game that is) -Great Online Community -Highly Moddable (As in mods are avalible but its up to you to not ♥♥♥♥ up the installation) -Instruments, along with custom songs you can enter  Cons -Sometimes Buggy Multiplayer -Crashes -The mining tool can be difficult to use sometimes -After you've spent as much time as I have in this game, it gets pretty boring after awhile  That's about all I can think of when it comes to pros and cons of this game If you can think of anything else leave a response to this review",

I have played Starbound 3 times, once when I first bought it, once when the game got a big 'Winter Update' and now I'm playing it again now that it has launched. I watched as this game became what it is now and followed the development process.  The first playthrough is what made me decide that this game had potential and it was going to be great one day, but it was really incomplete and lacked content. This was in 2013 when there was little to no progression system and a lot of grinding. The second playthrough was in 2015 and it was an entirely different experince. The devs have actively worked on this game and found its flaws, added convinient ways to build and explore, reduced the grinding to the point where I actually found it to be too little and improved combat to the best of their abilities.  What you have to realize is that this game is NOT a Terraria clone. This game is more similar to Minecraft or even No Mans Sky. The goal is not to fight bosses and reach the end or complete the story, but the story and the bosses are an addition to support the main experince: Exploration and Building. The combat is lackluster and the story is pretty straightforward. What really makes this game amazing is the dungeons you explore, the amazing feeling you get as you watch your ship jump from star to star and the cities you build for your citizens to thrive in. Nothing feels better than beaming down a planet and looking for cities when suddenly you find yourself in a thick sandstorm, with nothing but your flashlight to guide you to safety.  I know that this was a messy review, but after all the negativity this game recieved while it was in development, I decided to do my best to support it. Overall I really recommend it for people who like building and exploring. But if you liked Terraria only for the bosses and combat, you might want to wait for a discount or until the game is updated with better progression..",

Pro/Cons:  This game is big. It is a task to become familiar with how the game works and achive a understanding. That being said, the game has a ton of depth. It can keep you coming back for a long time  There are quests through the game to give a slghtly more linear expirence than terraria. This makes it easier to figure out what you are supposed to be doing. The game is in no way linear, however. It can be played any way you want.  Tons of customization.   Excellent online community. Use these resources for crafting, questing advice, and building.  Looks good. Sounds good.  Can alt-tab out easily for playing alongside a wiki.  Bottom line: If you like building style games (Minecraft, terraria, subnautica, etc.) but you wanted a bit more story, this is the game for you. If you don't know if you like those kinds of games, try one out. Notably this one. Just came out of early access and is an excellent game.",

There are a lot more and a lot better non-combat activities in Starbound and it actually has competent lore and a fine atmosphere.

Now the game looks like Terraria, but I think the game looks better in models, backgrounds, size, soundtrack, and scope of the game. The fact Starbound lets you work on a ship, travel planets, meet different races, create settlements on worlds, and even a little storyline are the reasons I am hooked. I got into Terraria for a while and it is a great game. I love that game still and the monsters, nights, overall charm of the game can not be defeated by Starbound in my opinion.

Many will compare this game with Terraria, and they're not wrong. Obviously they share many similarities, but all for a good reason.  The GOOD of this game is that there are many, many planets to explore, and tons of loot to obtain from exploring. There are also quest/missions in the game, which would be suitable for those who prefer a linear route of gameplay. Unlike in Terraria, base building is not compulsory, because in the beginning of the game they provide you with a ship to be used as a base. The combat is that of the Metroid-Vania genre, but is improved from it's early Access, and they added combos to melee weapons and special abilities to most of their weapons. Also they added more weapon types to the weapons list. I have to mention that the pixel art in this game is BEAUTIFUL, dare I say better then Terraria. But Terraria is beautiful in it's own pixel art-style, so don't get me wrong.  The few BAD things in this game is that the boss fights are too few, unlike Terraria. And some of them are too easy, despite being late game bosses.  But that doesnt really ruin the overall experiences. Heck, you've got to create your own character from many races, which is cool.

Would die instantly trying to use the Heat Cleaver again.  Would do Outpost missions again.  Would like content from old updates again.  Would get that weird feeling you get when you type the same word so many times it becomes weird again.  Would go from the farthest planet on the farthest possible point in the universe to the exact opposite planet on the other side just to see how long it would take me to get there again.  Would play songs on my ocarina while traveling to different star systems again.  Would bang.  Again.",

            "review_text": "[This review is from a guy who has had the game while it was in early access and is playing again with the game's official release.]  In a world filled with procedurally generated games, very few come near and far to what Starbound accomplishes as far as quality. If you enjoy games such as Terraria and Minecraft, you will absolutely enjoy this. This game has it all; exploration, farming, multiplayer, mining, crafting, quests, weapons, gadgets, boss battles, spaceships, multiple worlds, and more!  The gameplay is very similar to Terreria, where you have your character on a 2D plane and you explore the world arround you. Unlike Terreria, you are able to use a space ship to travel to different worlds, all unique in atmosphere, lore, and residents all while keeping your equipment and items throughout your entire playthrough of that character.  There are a TON of items you can collect in this game ranging from several different types of dirt and wood to different types of drops monster can give you to make certain type of equipment ranging from armor, tools, or weaponry. You will most likely get two daggers that look the same, but one will have poison damage and another will do fire damage which effects the type of damage per second (DPS) you will do.  The music and sounds in this game are -- excuse the pun -- out of this world! You will hear various orchastrated sounds for background music durring the day in certain bioms, certain areas underground, space, etc which all sound fantastic and make every world you visit feel new and different.  You can access different quests along your visit to these planets and outposts which you may choose to complete. The game has a main story which I have not yet complete so I can no comment on the quality of it, but from what I've seem included cutscenes and a neat story about saving the universe from a giant space cthuthlu.  Overall, I absolutely reccomend this game to every person who likes exploration, crafting, building, and space. Everything in this game ranging from music and sound to gameplay has been fine tuned and really gives so much of a unique experience that no two people will end up on the same planet when starting the game.",

            "review_text": "The atmosphere in this game is pretty well made. I liked the music and the art style. Every planet and biome is filled with its own life (And i would say sometimes its too much life because you really just can't walk around without stepping into something).  I did not really enjoy the battle system. Each creature in this game has its own style of attacking you. And that would be great if you had a way to defend yourself from most types of those attacks. But all you have got are shields, magic barriers, consumables which are used to improve resistance against certain type of damage, and healing items. The problem is that the amount of creatures that are attacking you and the types of their attacks are usually turning a fight with at least a little of strategy and planning into a mess. Instead of dodging or covering yourself from the attacks using shield, the easiest way to defeat any amount of creatures is just simply tanking them. Healing items don't have a real cooldown here (not considering the time their effects are active), so you can just craft a 100 of them and easily defeat any enemy by blindly rushing at it.  The bossfights here look beatiful but still are pretty boring because mostly its just attacking a standing or a slowly moving target and healing yourself from time to time. Guns like assault rifles and pistols are well balanced but mostly useless and not really fun to use. A fight with a gun here reminds me of fallout where instead of quickly killing your enemy usually you just have to hold the mouse and point the crosshair at him until he eventually dies from the whole mag of bullets shot in the head.  The main quest missions are not really much different from each other. Enemies in them were pretty easy to defeat (again they either had a lot of health or there were a lot of enemies with small amount of health) but dealt small amount of damage (just like your character) so the fights usually turned into slow rushing through the enemies) and i was not afraid for my life in any of these fights (this would be nice if that was just a storytelling game, but in my opinion its not, so the lack of challenge is pretty upsetting). The amount of side quests devs left for the final game is pretty small. There is a good amount of randomly generated quests given by people of your own town (or a village or whatever else you have built) but after completing more than 10 of these they get repetitive really fast.  I would say perhaps this game is not worth all of its money but it is a pretty good way to spend at least 24 hours of your time and i had many enjoyable adventures and moments in it. If you like adventures and space you should definetly try it. ",

Starbound is sadly often compared to terraria, which I have 250 hours on record, but in all honestly they are completely different games. Terraria has the fun of of epic fights and powerful weapons, while Starbound has the great RPG element and planet exploring systems in place. Starbound at quick glance has a clishe storyline, but in all truth the game wasn't made for the story. The boss fights are extremely fun, the item and buidling variety is incredible, the in game villages and dungeons are always amazing to loot and explore, whilst being easy to find.   The hunting down of clues inbetween boss fights can feel repitiive, but in reality the game is making you explore the vast unierse of planets and star systems, and with each boss fight your horizons expand and you can hunt for more new dungeons on more dangerous planets. This is not the game you are meant to rush through, trying to get the next armor set and defeat the next boss. It was far more fun for me to take my time digging into the story, and the culture of every race. Expand my own ship, ste up farms and colonies on my favorite types of planets, build space stations in aestroid belts, rather than just complete the main storyline quest. The game is miles deep, always suprising me with something new and amazing to do within its large boundaries.   Overall, Starbound is the only survival game to truly put you into an open unievsre with fun and exciting quests, unique lore and gripping lore, and a sandbox of building and mining.",

Well as i already said after choosing one of the 6 races which have different ships and race specific armors, after the cutscene and a little bit of a tutorial you start to notice that the gameplay isnt that much different from Terraria... which isnt a bad thing if youre a Terraria fan, but this game does a lot of things in a different way, here you have journeys from solar system to solar system, there may be less bosses but their more different from eachother and the game is more about exploration than.

Now this game was in beta/alpha what have you for awhile, there was lots of content cut (like racial weapons) for the full game. I understand some things are subject to change in early access games and that doesn't bother me with things cut, it's cutting corners. Now don't get me wrong i enjoy this game but if you are looking for a terraria with space explortation game then do not bother with this game. As terraria has alot more content. This game in itself has many races to pick from each with their own culture. They even met their kickstarter goal to add in the Novakids, a race of wild western people made of pure energy. Now that sounds interesting what kind of colonies would they have? 'The novakids do not have colonies'. That is what it says in the race description. Now i would have to say that is cutting corners on a race that they had very well over 2 years to make.  There is also a disturbing lack of Legendary weapons. yes they are unique but they are far and few.  Now coming from a view point not comparing it as a space terraria. The game story is great at the start and loses steam fairly quickly. the ending feels rushed. There are many bugs plauging this game, and i understand that now a days when games go gold there are bugs to be had, but this many game breaking bugs is a little disheartening. Alone in a 2hr session i had the game crash on me 7 times.   I will continue to enjoy this game, i only reccomend this game to people who are interested in building, surivival or even just exploration games. But overall i do not reccomend to buy this game.",

            "review_text": "Summary: mainly a cosmetics game with some really cool features, if you like 2D building games you'll like this, very casual, wait for a sale/wait for more content to flow in.  Note: I wanted to redo my first review to make it more short and sweet.  Alright, ive been following the development of this game for 5-6 years now and in all honesty im slightlydissapointed in what has been made, i get the feeling that the game was pushed out a bit to early (development wise)  I'll go over the main features just so you know what to expect.  Character: acts like terraria were you can bring your character into multiplayer and singleplayer, 7 Races with many customazation options and a ship pet, each with a upgradable ship which acts a a mobile home (upgradable through getting max crew for current tier of ship or just buying the next upgrade)  Main Story: your doing the same quest 5 times with increasing difficulty. the first and last quest are the onlyones that are unique. atleast you dont have to do em except for the first quest to fix your ship. and most ofthe shops in the outpost require main quests to be done so, if you want more stores, do the quests.  Exploration: as expected you'll start seeing the same thing over and over since there isnt that much biome varietywithin the different star systems. and asteroid fields don't have iron for some reason...  Colonization: since i have not used this feature yet, i assume that because of the unloading when your not on a planet its mainly just for fun and has little functionality.  Farming: unfortunatly due to game design you should make a farm on your ship since if your away from your farm(if its on a planet) it doesn't get loaded. but if its on your ship its always loaded and growing. but there are quite a few crops and 7 (i think?) livestock.  Modding: the modding scene is very lively for now.  General: lots of customization (color armor/cosmetic, paint tool), lots of cosmetic items, customizable sign thing that can be made to have an animation, 4 vehicles (2 just recolor of hoverbike thing and a sail boat). 12 techs (powerups), most are pretty bad, i recomend the sprint and multijump tech, the spike ball (allows to climb walls) is pretty useful.  Ideas: what I think would be some good ideas for chucklefish to add would be a area loader esc device so if you have a planet wide cotton farm it can grow while your off adventuring. Some more vehicles and tech. some more variety to end game, maybe a weapon creator, which would record the different parts of Procedural Generated weapons you pick up and each part has a different value to either make the firing slower but stronger, faster but weaker, or just general  bonuses, or just purely cosmetic, fun stuff like that. have some sort of automation for farming like be able to make a farming colony or slave colony and have them farm or mine, somthing of that sort.  Problems: One of the biggest problems is that there are so few activities to do, as in: run around the universe collecting every instrument or just general unique item, build a colony (which is pretty shallow in content), collect every monster, get a crew, do the main and side quests and procedurally generated quests (not too much variety, i think like 4 or 5 variants). make a farm (even thought there only worth while when on your ship).and with main/side quests, crew, and colony these just kinda get done pretty quickly. so its really up to the imagination to what you want to do with the game. although at its current state i'd hold off till more things come into play.",

Without using mods, it offers 18 main biomes to explore, plus several other mini biomes, and planets can contain more than one biome at a time. To progress in the story, you will be exploring most of them.  The building tool can place multiple blocks at a time, and at a distance, the placing distance can be increased by upgrading the building tool, this makes it quite easy to build very big structures: In several other games of the same cathegory, building can give you headaches due to slow placing speed and low placing distance. Plus, this game contains a fully featured colony system wich allows you to choose what kind of colonists will be inhabiting your towns just by choosing the furniture inside rooms. And Plus again, scanning furniture occuring in randomly generated npc villages around the universe allows you to replicate said furniture in your 3d printer, allowing you even more customization in your colonies. I passed days building my main city.  There is nothing that special to combat, you will be shooting into enemies or getting close to get a hit with your sword trying to avoid getting punched yourself. Several weapons to choose from, some of wich can be crafted, but for the most part you'll be using randomly generated weapons found scattered in the worlds you explore. Daggers, swords, longswords, shields, guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, shotguns, bows and special unique weapons like boomerangs or tentacle launchers are some of the weapons you will find about. Bosses offer a more variegated challenge, with patterns of attacks that need to be memorized, and they are generally far more lethal than the monsters you find normally.  There is a story with some lore into it, but I did not care much about it. It's really just an excuse to have you explore around.  This all can be further improved with the vast selection of mods available for download. Some of these can extend the game quite a lot.  As for the negative side, game suffers from stuttering expecially if you are traveling about at very fast speed. In multiplayers, world sections failing to load are commonplace. This can be made a lot worse if you carelessy install too many mods- but that will be your fault.   Little else to say. It's worth a buy if you like the genre.",

Other top rated reviews are of course typical one liners with little to no thought, merit or explanation of the game or just blind and blatent fanboyism. This is Steam reviews after all and its to be expected I suppose. Even with my lack of faith in humanity wavering as it may be on steam I have learned not go with the crowd and just to enjoy what I enjoy.  I wanted to give this a fair review and with the 1.0 update this game has in my opinion surpassed Terraria. There is a great deal to do now and the combat and many things are fleshed out and feel better then they did in the past. The game is very addicting once you get into it and gets even more fun when playing with others. And now for the cons..  Even though I praise it for coming a long way its not still without its flaws here and there. While it runs on almost anything it is not 100% smooth all the time and lags a bit (mainly script lag). The fall damage can sometimes be harsh and the starvation hunger mechanic in my opinion drains too quickly. Another gripe is that starting out things go very slowly and can get tedious until you upgrade yourself and your tools.   These are all minor things compared to the positives in this game and most can be remedied by selecting mods that cater to your playstyle. I believe that mods that come out for this will perfect extend the game which is already full of depth over time and for 15 bucks or less on sale you really can't go wrong with this one. Don't listen to the hate as people will often complain for the sake of it on steam.",

            "review_text": "[EDITED] Hello, everyone.  On the surface, this game may seem like a clone to the popular game Terraria, which I own. But this game goes much further than Terraria and I personally place this as one of my favorite games of all time. There was so much new content that has been added since the previous updates, when this new content, such as the plot, crafting devices, GUIs, and much more, was only available via Starbound- Unstable Nightly mode on steam, and now this content has been made official.  This game feels and looks fun to play, with races to play, a giant community to back up the game, and so much potential. You just want to start building from day 1 in the game.  Since the beta versions, there was never any protectorates, no relics, no reason for the sudden dissapearance. This was just a simple sandbox game that you would use just to build stuff or beat the crap out of everything. Now there is actual plot, interesting missions, and much more content packed into this tight little package of a game. Honestly, there's so much to explore and even after playing this game for so long I was still wowed by most of the newer stuff in this game.  Multiplayer is still so much fun, maybe even more so than before. I've played with my dad on the Nightly 0.9 package the before the game was released and I had so much fun. Me and my dad died more times than I can count, we ended up taking shelter inside a rotten tower in my starter planet just to survive!  In conclusion, there is so much content than the Beta edition of the game and this game is so worth your money. I would recommend this to anyone who like building, sci-fi, or thought Terraria was a good game.  9.9/10 would die from a monster on your starter planet again.",

Since then, the developers have added quite a bit of content to it, including a story driven quest line and story driven objectives as well as more advanced monster AI. They continue to add to the game as well as correct bugs and the game is still in early access. I cant speak to the newest additions to the game as it has been ages since I played, but I love what Starbound brings to the table.  Important note, this is NOT Minecraft and it is NOT Terraria but it is in the same genre as these games. It has enough about it that is different to feel very different to the other two games I mentioned above (and love dearly) but, as you would expect, there are some similarities as well. The base building is pretty sweet and the exploration is nicely done as well. You can collect tons of stuff and horde it or not worry about it and jump around (assuming you have completed certain story missions).  The game is amazing and I do highly recommend it if your into the sandbox, quest objective, base building type of games!",

'Oh, great' I thought to myself, seeing workshop support and the missions system the devs were hyping so hard before i quit, 'this is gonna be like what I played months ago, but better!' No... Months ago, you could craft a pick for an early-game mining upgrade, months ago, the combat wasn't trying to be dark souls except everything attacks 5x faster than you and does 20-something contact damage whilst you struggle to hit for more than 10 with the starting sword (because you cant spelunk for iron without first getting better weapons, yadda yadda). Also, until you can fathom what the hell a core fragment is, or indeed luck out enough to find some, that exploration element in the game is thoroughly closed off, with your ship being little more than a respawn room.

I have not played Early Access and I have read many reviews on so many people being disappointed because of the lack of content that was promised or expected. I understand that frustration but this game has exceeded my expectations. Coming from 100+ hours from Terraria, I grew to love this game in a very short time. Movement is a little clunky but you get used to it. Combat is great, I love the feel of it. The attention to detail is amazing in this game. I don't want to spoil anything but the tiniest details makes me want to play more. The art style of this game is gorgeous as I love the look and design of characters and buildings.  I began to progress into other quests and other planetary systems. It was slightly annoying to navigate and the instructions were not the clearest. If you have never played StarBound before, I recommend it. It shares similarites with Terraria but at the same time, it is nothing like Terraria.   The only bug I found so far was that every so often a weapon from my tool bar would magically disappear.  There is no quest sharing when you are playing with another player which is a big deal in my opinion because it kinda sucks when you decline a quest but your friend accepts it.  All in all, I rate this game 8/10. There can be a lot to update. (Again, I will update this review to the best of my ability when either an update ensues or my opinion changes)",

There are now more quests to do to give you some guidance instead of wondering mindlessly in space. Difficulty has changed as well. The AI for NPCs, enemies, and bosses have improved greatly. Fuel is no longer static in distance between planets or systems (1, 50, 200 fuel), but value of fuel depends how far the destination is (range from 1 to 1000) in terms of systems; no fuel is used between planets in the same system. However, still able to travel far max 1000 fuel than when it reaches that point. Sectors removed which is sorta a double edge sword to some...  Only flaw is you'll be grinding in a   Fiery Star System   for end-game content (highest armor). All new characters start on the same planet instead of randomly in the universe (your starter planet will also be the multiplayer starter planet if hosting) which means resources may become more difficult with each new character.  Another downside, and this is a neutral point on Starbound, Hamachi is no longer going free service. 7 day trial then have to pay a minimum of $100/year to use. Either know and can portforward or have to find a public server that is reliable to play with friends in Starbound, otherwise hope to use Hamachi often to equal out the fee.   Dec 27, 2013-Jan 1, 2014  (Most no longer applies after Upbeat Giraffe) No words can describe how awesome this is. More fun than Terraria, more to explore than Minecraft.  I'm not usually into sci-fi games, but this is really executed very well that I can't get enough of it. I'm sharing coordiantes with other friends as well! Despite the imminate wipes, you never know what you'll start out next.  Tired of dealing with idiots that do nothing but troll, bully, and just give you and others a hard time, allowing no fun at all? Jump into this game, cut loose of that poor excuse of a community, and be lost in Starbound...   FOREVER  .  Also, if you ever played .hack, the exploration may seem similar to the chaos gate. Three Keywords, three variables: sector, x, y (with addition to solar system/star and planet name). In multiplayer (not 100% sure in terms of Starbound) be a slim chance to find another player on the same planet by random. Crude similiarity, but still.  Update: I also noticed another similiarity to .hack. Each system starts with the sector name, Alpha, followed by 1-3 words or 1-2 words and a number. Some keywords would have two words instead of one, and still count as a single keyword. Sadly you still primarly need sector, x, and y to find the planet.  -----  Check out more games I see that deserve more attention from my curator group:  BluePaw's Underrated Games List  Join and/or follow if you wish.",

Upon release I was worried that it was going to be another Terraria clone, but boy was I pleasantly surprised. This game is a breath of fresh air, with crafting, great upgrade mechanics, interstellar travel, and now with the addition of scripted events it feels more solid then ever before. The feeling of maneuvering my ship through the uncharted galaxy made this 65 year old squeal. That's not to say that there aren't a few gripes I have with the game. The major one being the replay value, I find myself only coming back to the game after there has been an update, and after completing the new content I have no intention to start again. This cycle of riding the new releases is annoying, although it is a early access game still so you have to give the developers time. Other then that there are a few things that make this game a spectacular buy. Like the looting system, allowing you to customize your star adventurer with thousands of rare pieces of armor throughout the game. or the dungeons, scripted missions that are a blast to play with friends. To sum it all up, this game is a masterpiece in its own right. When you compare it to minecraft, some contention arises. Minecraft has done everything that this game has done but BETTER. I played minecraft after having played 60 hours of starbound and the adrenaline rush I got from the vastly superior gameplay that Minecraft offers made me repeatedly slam my head into the dry wall until the pain from my bludgeoned skull was only matched from the agony I was feeling on behalf of my throbbing manhood.

Though we have been told it's 3 updates away, which probably means mid-2016. Looking a lot better now still though. weekday dev blogs on the website. Colonization is in. The plan is 1.final combat update 2.story/progression update 3.economy update if I remember correctly and the economy one is the only one that I don't know for sure if they have a clear idea of what they're implementing. but that's 2 updates out, and having 2 updates of assurance they have a good plan is pretty good imo.   1.0 Update (edited 8/6/2016): The game is at the core same as before. Yes, there are a bunch of things that I personally don't like with the 1.0 changes, but there are mods for that and I see where chucklefish was going with what they did. Fun game, bunch of new stuff, progression is a bit wonky because there is no handholding and you just have to figure out what to do. This can make is real hard to learn the system, but once you do it's very self consistant. I still definately recomend it if you want an exploration/building game.  At the heart it's still very much a game where if you like bulding and exploring you're in for dozens of hours of fun. If you want lore you can go read books in villages and dungeons for even more hours. And then you can use those things you collected to uild your own awesome stuff to show off. Contrast that though to if you want to do combat and 'story' progression. If you do the game will get old pretty quick.   The game is 'like' Terraria in style and genre, but the focus and core gameplay is completely and absolutely different. It's like saying Smash Bros and Tekken are the same style and genre and then trying to compare them directly. They're very different types of fighting games, just like Starbound and Terraria are very different types of tile sidescrollers or w/e you call them.   A lot of ♥♥♥♥ you see trashing the game is about how the Devs haven't lived up to their promises, which in some aspects they haven't, and in some aspects the game feels disjointed in it's design (lack of tile protection in some RNG dungeons). But they have stated they're comitted to developing post 1.0 content and the scope of their original kickstarter/early access was on the scale of Starcitizen's scope, which is honestly absurd to hold them to. Sure they should not have made the promises they couldn't keep, but equally to blame are people who expect them to keep absurd promises they made 4 years ago when they were fledging developers and didn't know just just how much work creating an engine from scratch and all the assets would be. I would rather the game be in a decent state and pushed to 1.0 than have it be perpetually 0.8-9 trying to chase stretch goals that are not worth the implementation effort to get into the 1.0 build.",

Starbound, prior to it's release this year had always felt sort of empty, yet nothing like empty. The way i always described it to people who didn't know about the game or hadn't heard of it was 'Terraria in space' and while some aspects that were similar (2D graphics and the like) Starbound was still different. The space exploration gave an extra feel to the game. One you couldn't get from Terraria. You weren't bound to a single world where every aspect that you found crucial to your game would be randomized if it would be there or not. In Starbound you are quite literally, bound for the stars. The galaxy is yours to create, destroy or explore in. I have watched this game grow from it's humble beginnings back in 2013 all the way up to it's full release on the 22 of july 2016. It's had some rough patches throughout it's early access, getting many redesigns for not only in game assets (ships, crafting stations) but also having had complete overhauls. At first being able to make coal and use it as ship fuel, after which you can just leave your starter planet, requiring you to slay several bosses to be able to progress through the sectors. This changed to starting with a broken ship and being able to only travel within the range of your starting system until you supply your ship with core fragments from your starter planet. this mechanic stayed somewhat but changed. Now with the full release, you start out on earth for the tutorial. Anyone who knows something about the game knows what happens to earth. anyway, you escape and the game begins. Instead of being able to fly through your starting system you now need to travel to the outpost via portal on your starting world, which requires 20 core fragments to work. after this you need erchius crystals to repair your ship. This is where the adventure truly begins.  You play through an interesting and gripping story with fun missions to play (my personal favourite is the Glitch one) in which you have to gather 6 McGuffins to complete the story. The storyline takes you to all different manners of planets, sometimes to multiple because you can't find everything on one planet.  Ore progression is also more interesting now, to get the higher tier ores you have to look at the difficulty level of the planet, moderate difficulty? you get titanium.   New mechanics were included in the full release like fossil hunting, where through a minigame you have to uncover fossils, so you can put those up for display. From a fossilized egg, all the way up to an Ixodoom skeleton, the minigame can be quite annoying sometimes because you either don't have enough tool usages anymore and you only needed 1 more piece, yet the game still decides that the excavation is incomplete.  The end of the game and the final boss fight left me satisfied, the battle was difficult, but not unplayable. However, the game may feel empty to those who didn't plan for anything to do after the main quest, and that's fine. the game will probably still get updated (extra story after the main one, who knows right?) from time to time.  My judgement of this game is in the TL;DR, but i'll repeat it here: Amazing game, satisfying gameplay, somewhat empty after main mission (which can easily be filled up by personal in-game projects) overal 8.7/10   If you like this genre of games. BUY THIS GAME.  ",

The game is very different and that's a good thing! They added a cool story, more quests, awesome weapons and armor, but it still feels like a sandbox game to rival the titans like Terraria or Minecraft. I've been having a blast playing through the game and it has room for improvment but it still exceeds my expectaions!  However... Ever since 1.0 this game feels... slower, It feels choppy and laggy and sometimes almost unplayable. My computer is pretty good and is able to run games like Borderlands and CS:GO on pretty nice setting. But when I set the setting for this game on low and try to do things like the Baron Glitch mission or bigger bosses, my game runs slow and sometimes doesnt respond. I've tried fixes for this but they don't seen to work.  Dispite that I think this game is definatly worth the buy and has great potential to become an even greater game!  Easily 8/10, Fix issues with optimization and combat lag and it becomes a 10/10",

With 77 hrs of playing, I have to say that this game was intriguing at first, with the new systems and mechanics that are unique. You have a ship to build, some randomly generated dungeons to conquer, millions of planets to set foot on, which are indeed some cool features of sandbox. However, behind this cool concept the game seems not to be so well executed. First this game currently does not have a well-plotted storyline to follow but a penguin-themed army. The quests are irrelevant as NPCs just ask you to burn your fuel and find stuff. Second, combat is boring, moves are rigid, you do not get much reaction from monsters. Third, upgrading your gears becomes boring as you feel that mining is repetitive after you reach tier 3 gear.  That is why I prefer Terraria. Once the player cannot see the main story, quests do not provide enough feeling of immersion. Plus that the targets players focus on are thrown into this vast ocean of planets, which inevitably prolong your gameplay. And that will result in your exhaustion after hours of playing, and you will find that you are repeating what you have done.  I have read some info in the archive and notice that the developers have actually done a lot in building the background. And the frescoes in that ancient ruin are magnificent too. And that's why I still recommend this game because in the future updates there might be more culture in this game. It is still in early access anyway.  **Edit**   When this game came out of Early Access as Starbound 1.0 I have to admit that this game is fairly complete now. Now we have a proper intro, a main story line, and a lot more cool stuff, which will surely grant another 100+ hours of gameplay if you choose to create a new character as I did. And when you beat the final boss there is still the awesome Frackin Universe mod you can download and try which will give you another 50+ hours of gameplay (if you don't cheat). With the support of steam workshop, this game is good enough.",

            "review_text": "Disclaimer - I have only played a small portion of this massively crafted game, so take this more of a first impression than anything else.  Starbound is a great 2D survival platformer that unlike other such games like Terraria and Minecraft, actually emphasis a lot of it's time into it's story. Because of this exploring the world of Starbound doesn't become something you do because 'I need to get these minerals, so I can make better gear' or 'I wonder what backstory these Florans have'. It gives you a moto or even better a helping hand in the right direction.   However, even because of this the story can be lackluster and can feel like a hassle when you need to scan crucial highlighted objects. The hassle comes when you have a few objects left and you need to backtrack to a small village to find that crucial objects. But after that there isn’t much that this games does wrong when it comes to be a survival platformer. But before I begin with pros and cons I just want to say something that worries me when it comes to the amount of content that this game has to show.   This worry derives from the fact that the story and that the new types of minerals that you need to make better gear correlates with each others. Before we delve too deep into this let me explain the reason why this is worrisome. There are five major races, all of these has something that is called a keystone that you need to open a massive gate to (I presume) defeat a boss. The question is “Will there be second part after defeating that boss, like there is with Terraria when defeat wall of flesh and Hardmode kicks in?” If the answer is no, then you basically have beaten the game after that boss. If yes, then there is more content and minerals to explore. And even if my worry is proven right, what Starbound gives is well worth over it’s current prize pool and would easily be worth 30€ with just what it gives in quality alone.   TL;DR: With this said let’s end this first impression review with pros and cons:  Pros: - The feeling of exploration in this game is amazing - The music is perfectly crafted to immerse yourself into the world and gives you the feeling of adventure and wonder. - The story helps the game move forward in a healthy speed - Minerals of any sort doesn’t take to long to find compared to Terraria and Minecraft - Will definitely give at least +50 hours of game time.  Cons: - It’s a hassle to scan objects to proceed with the story",

This game isn't Terraria, it isn't Zelda, it isn't WoW...but for $15 it can be a lot of fun, but as I said, it's a SANDBOX. Side note to all the 'repetitive objectives' commenters: World of Warcraft has gone strong for several years and is (even after surviving WoD) still going even though all of it's quests are 'go to place,' 'get thing,' or 'kill stuff' or some combination thereof.

Now after 3 days, half of it is gone. Why? The content is just too little. Alot of blocks and furniture, yes, but where is tha actual useful content?  I crafted a solaris armor and got the best ranged weapon in the game, after 12 hours. Now that's kind of concerning.  I didn't even have to finish the final boss. Bosses here give you nothing but ♥♥♥♥. Literally. Even the pixels they give are ♥♥♥♥. 12 pixels for killing the flying alien penguin ship? Wow. How OVERWHELMING.  What Terraria did good in this aspect is that it made it very hard to acquire items and things, thus making it feel rewarding to actually finally have crafted your armor set. And they had far, FAR more content than in Starbound. 5 years in development, free, unpaid testers, and an extremely large capital from the kickstarter project for this game, and what did they use the money for? Expand the company so they can be like Steam - game indexing instead of game development. They've used the funds orignally set for Starbound for other projects, and now they can't deliver.  Everything else that you can do in this game is just for prettying up things. There are like 3 planet types with 1-2 subtypes that basically diversifies the content by just about 5-10 percent, and it's not even funny. The only thing that adds usefulness with building are farms, if you're casual, for the buffs aside from stim packs.  This was a projec in failure. What 1.0 did was just overhaul the grind, not lengthen it, make it more useful, or make it more rewarding. They basically just organized the content already in there, and deprecated 80% of it.

I completed the main quest, made all the EPPs (gave you the ability to explore planets with radiation, extreme temperatures, and planets with complete darkness), and upgraded my ship and crew. I did all this through the break, and stopped playing by the end of it.  One thing that I did not try was making a base on a planet. But that would require the person that everyone joins off of is on most of the time, or they have to leave their PC on.

Yes, they are sort of different to a certain extent, but the level of scale and depth in Starbound makes it an all round winner in my opinion.

The game even contains its own hardcore mode, with hunger and stuff. It's pretty cool. The game contains procedurally generated planets, and its extremely easy to connect to a friend. With the addition of workshop, basically all of my complaints were cleaned up quick and easy. But here is a problem I have with the game, with the addition of workshop this early in the games developement. It kind of removes the need for the developers to address any issues, with the current model of the game, as mods can literally fix everything. I understand the current version is very stable, balanced, and performance issues have been fixed. I just hope the developers continue to add things to the game even though, they really don't have to. Also it has loot like terraria, which obviously adds a ton of playtime on its own. Also every new update (at least for me), causes my mods to not load. This is easily fixable, all you have to do just keep relaunching the game until it works. It's that simple.",

MASSIVE ONES. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ok that's enough (yes, no writing WOOOOOOOOOO)  PROS: -Races. (no racist jokes plox) -Stunning graphics. -Weather. Nuff said. -Lots and lots and lots and lots of planets.

For all of you who played the beta and thought this game was boring as hell or it tried really hard to be a Terraria but it failed, now it's the perfect time to play the game, no words can describe how much the game has grown since the beta, Terraria is one of my favorite games of all time but I gotta say, since it released I've been playing non-stop, and maybe it's getting even better than Terraria, you have so much stuff to do and so many interesting things. For example  - 7 different races - Each race got something around 10 or more armors, their own ships and their own commentaries about the scenario and items. - Vehicles - Mechas - Different ships - Dungeons like quests - Tons and tons of cosmetics  - Pets - Companions - And one billion different itens to make your house THE best house of the galaxy And this is just the tip of the iceberg, it's so good, so amazing, it's not an easy game which is always great, and you got an amazing co-op adventure and amazing mods for the game. Again, for you who played the beta and didn't like it, give it a second chance now, it will blow your mind how different it looks now. ",

Terraria felt like WAY too much grinding compared to this game. I think the biggest set back was the lack of direction and requirement to use the wiki for directions or help constantly. In Terraria 100% of my friends and online tutorials abused some type of outside source to 'cheat' the grind system. It's sad when you can't find a single legit player to play with for fun. Lets just goto X server and get all the best gear in the game instantly.  In Starbound, there is no need for a wiki. The recipees are locked behind a blueprint system. Also the quest system gives you some guidance on what you should do to progress via the story line. The worlds are round, (Terraria worlds are flat). There are MANY worlds.  Terrarias greatest gift was the ability to grind Bosses for items. My mistake was that I never grinded bosses for items :(... Those bosses never rewarded me with anything good... I either didn't want to grind the gear to be able to take on the bosses, or I cheated and already had the best gear in game. So drops were pointless in Terraria. In Terraria, I grinded for 20+ hours just to fight/kill the first boss (pathetic). In Starbound, it took me less than 6 hours to kill the first boss without ever using outside guides. No cheating at all.  I feel the pacing in Starbound is done MUCH better than Terraria. While, I felt that Terraria was GRIIIIND GRIND GRIIIND, quit grinding and cheat.   One last note, building stuff is faster and different. Remember left click for placing bricks, and right click for placing bricks in the background (wall). Took me a while to figure that out, even thou it tells you that in one of the manual book codex things in the game.",

Terraria's worlds are almost always identical to each other 'every world has a dungeon, jungle, etc.) but Starbound not only has an infinite amount of worlds, but those planets have a HUGE amount of variety in them. Now, most people would argue 'But 2 planets with the same biome are pretty much the same!'. Almost every planet has not only sub-biomes, but towns comprised of various species, a large variety of dungeons, and even MORE stuff underground.   I'll try to keep this review short but here's my main warning; if you go in to this game trying to play it like Terraria, you will HATE it.

As an avid player of Terraria I was excited to see what the spiritual successor could bring on, what changes it would implement, and how it would take the 2d platformer rpg genre and move it in a new direction.  After four years of consistent developement, disappointment in the release scheduling, and 100+ hours of personal play time in both the Alpha and the Beta, I can safely say the developers at Chucklefish have created the most amazing, and well thought out spiritual sucessor to Terraria I could have possibly imagined, and have carved out a name for themselves in the indy dev gaming scene, and I'm glad because of it.  If you loved Terraria and everything it brough with it to the gaming scene, then you will absolutely love this game. It is filled with enough story driven, and non story driven content, to keep you occupied for hundreds of hours. Enough bosses to keep you progressing (And frustrated and times), and enough non-linear content including, farming, base building, archealogy, crew building and management, and colonies, not to mention the near infinite galaxy of planets to explore, and the hundreds of items and gear to collect and create!  If you have never heard of Terraria, or played a 2d platformer rpg, well now is your opportuinity to delve into something great and wonderful. I highly suggest it for the price tag, and I promise you, you will not be dissapointed, I sure wasn't.",

It feels like there were much bigger plans but the devs ended up bitting off more than they could handle.   The missions are shallow and are (to me) a dissapointment. They never truely made me feel like I was part of a story. Unlocking the missions is a tedious and uninspired chore of moving from one random planet to another hoping that you get lucky and find what you need. The characters in the missions are never given time to develop into anything more than a source of exposition.   The planets are numerous and are truely massive. While this means there are pleanty of places to explore, this also means that there are large tracts of land that have nothing to see. No matter how much the enviroment varies, large empty areas are just boring to trek through. I can't help but feel like there was going to be a lot more content that would have filled these areas...  In the end, starbound has a excellent framework that COULD be developed into something amazing but comes across as somewhat shallow. If you want to build an amazing looking 2D sci-fi colony, this is for you, If you want an adventure, look elsewhere.  Make sure this is something you truely will enjoy before you buy it.",

It's a Terraria like exploration with mining and building and features a simple but cute story. Now don't get me wrong, when I said 'Terraria like' I didn't mean to say that it's just like Terraria. Not at all actually. The game plays completely different than Terraria and I can guarantee you that if you liked that game a lot, you will like this.  Honestly, I cannot say that it's a perfect game but it really isn't bad like some people are saying. It's got it's flaws. Lots of them. To list a few:  - Poor performance even on relatively good PCs (not getting above 62FPS for some reason even with a 70HZ screen and unlocked Vsync and it drops to even 15FPS from place to place. Rain is pretty much the FPS killer in this game) - Annoying quests for the main story. It can take hours to scan find enough stuff to scan to get the coordinates for the mission. It's not the scanning which is the problem. It's finding a settlement that has the correct race and items to scan... It's really a pain in the ♥♥♥ for the majority of the game. - Introduction is very plain. It doesn't tell you anything and the game became a lot more complex than Terraria was when it came out. No Guide of some sorts to explain items or anything like that sadly. - No way to teleport back to your ship once you are at the core of the planet. You MUST dig your way all the way back up if you want your ore on Survival difficulty. No potions or tech to help you out at some kind of cost or anything. It would seem like a chellange but it's really just a pain in the butt.  Now don't get me wrong. These are not all the bad things about the game but on the other hand, while it does have LOTS of problems atm, it does as well a lot of good stuff.  - Playing with friends was never easier. (A really cool feature is that if you are playing with someone who is connected to the same modem/router, even if internet connection drops for some reason, it won't kick you out of your friends lobby, in fact, even if you joined over Steam to your friends game, it will automatically switch to LAN and keep a steady connection. Not bad...) - Insane ammounts of high quality content. - Farming has never been so rewarding because of the insane amount of cooking recepies which are a blast to explore. - Building your own towns with NPCs to live in them. - Catching Pokemon is a thing! - Great huge world to explore with lots of great NPCs.  Hopefully the performance problems will be patched soon after this review but even with all the problems this game has as of right now, I can still very much recommend it. I had a great time playing thru it and will do again.",

            "review_text": "I really want to love Starbound, I've been waiting for it for years...but I can't. It's a simple problem of control. I never appreciated just how tight and easy simply interacting with Terraria is until I'd spent only a few hours in Starbound, and all those minor problems add up to sheer frustration at why the hell Starbound doesn't just copy the best parts of the Terraria setup like anyone with sense would do. It's like making a Total War game but not wholesale copying the battlefield control scheme in favour of some different, crappier version.  For me, it can be boiled down to some important problems:  1) Field of view. Terraria has a generous field of view and Starbound doesn't. You can press CTRL to move it around, but that's nothing compared to simply pulling the view out and letting us actually SEE the world. Even if the underground were fully lit, you're still fumbling around blind compared to the original, and sadly far better implemented 2D survival craft-em-up Terraria.  2) Momentum. This creates the biggest point of utterly frustrating lack of control in Starbound. Your character controls like a heavy brick in the air, then the situation flips over when landing, where your character never seems to 'stick'. The result is that while you'll have fun spelunking around in Terraria because you have a generous field of view and slick, precise control of your character, in Starbound you're stuck in a claustrophobic postage stamp of space with a character that you can't feel entirely in control of.  3) Poor controls and UI setup. In Terraria you just tap down to drop through a platform. Quick, easy, affords you perfect control; Starbound has a duck seemingly just so they could have another pointless boondoggle for challenge rooms, and so to drop down you press down and jump. It makes a hell of a difference. On once hand you can move up and down the environment with two single button presses in an intuitive fashion, on the other, you're having to perform a button combo to move in one of the four cardinal directions....utilising one of the buttons you use to move up. And it's the cardinal direction that will instantly slaughter you with fall damage if you mess it up. Genius.  Then there's weirdly obtuse things like containers, which can be opened with E, but only closed by clicking on the X or hovering over the container which is now BEHIND the UI and pressing E again....instead of just pressing E again. Doesn't sound bad....until you want to get out of the UI quickly because of an enemy and can't, or if you've got lots of crates to go through.  4) Garbage early game. The early game of Starbound is unacceptably frustrating and boring. You've got a character that's needlessly imprecise to control, a characterless starting world, and then you potentially have to take that easily fall killed character all the way to the very bottom of that characterless world before you're allowed to progress. You literally have no other way to progress, you HAVE to go to the bottom of that world AND climb all the way back up.  This creates a game where there's no joy in exploring because simply interacting with my character and the environment is frustrating. There's no excuse for such problems when you're effectively a follow-up to Terraria which did these things better before you even existed.  Starbound has a lot of content, but the problem is that interacting with that content is clunky and frustrating. It doesn't matter how good the rest of the game is when simply moving around and interacting with the rest of the game is needlessly ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.",

Stop comparing it and most important of all, don't have biased opinion or negative thoughts beforehand. You ready? Here we go.  Starbound is a game where you explore procedurally generated planets, with the same assets in some of them, but always in a different fashion. The galaxy is infinite and it will take an eternity to explore all of it. Mostly because it's infinite. The weapons are well thought trough and so are the enemies, the species and the NPC's. And even though the story starts off whacky and weird, it all comes around in the end even including an Alphabet for the ancient language in the game which is not constantly spoken and has to be searched for to be able to find it.  The game is so full of stuff to do that I myself haven't finished it yet. It's so full of stuff to do! Wanna blow up a planet? Go for it! Wanna own your own farm and purchase the most legendary items in the game? JUST DO IT! Wanna fight armies of Humanoid monkeys, fish, flowers and stars? ♥♥♥♥ YEAH! And even more. I can't even come close to explaining how awesome this game is! If something becomes too hard or tricky, just use a wiki. It's full of stuff that can help you!

            "review_text": "Once upon a time, you were a recruit at Starfleet Academy, when a super-powerful alien entity decided that reality is like a hentai visual novel - time for the kid gloves to come off, the tentacles to come on, and the Earth itself as the schoolgirl to be violated. You were lucky enough to survive in a highly damaged ship.  Starbound is a 2D block-buildy game similar to Terraria set among the stars. The scenario is that Earth was destroyed as noted above; you have to collect six Macguffins and defeat the final boss to avenge the Earth...regardless of your origin race. Good times!  Starbound draws inspirations from  many  games and IPs - Terraria, Zelda, Metroid, Star Trek, and more are represented in some way or another. And, to its credit, it does it well.  You can't talk about this game without noting that this is a controversial title due to things that happened during its lengthy, well-documented/discussed development. I am going to intentionaly ignore those things and talk about the game we have in front of us, today. The question I am answering is  do I recommend  this  game?  The answer is yes...barely.   What Works  First, the general presentation is well-done. The art style is effective, the music is tranquil and plays to the aesthetic of exploring an uncaring universe solo. The nods to other IPs are done in a loving way. The creative team on this game did great.  The static content is very well thought-out, to the point where I could comment that we could've had a great static game a lot more quickly than it took to get what we have now. The first boss, the Erchius Horror, is a great puzzle boss that emphasizes mobility over brawn. The various 'protected' mini-dungeons on planets are great parkour challenges that use the mobility mechanics in this game - including double-jumps, morph ball segments, and dashes - to great effect. The story underlying this is a standard, but lovingly delivered B-movie plot that is cheesy, but sincere, while moving the player to take on greater challenges.  The construction aspect of the game is also good. You can make your planetary colonies truly yours, and it's always nice when your colonists periodically give you gifts for keeping them safe and happy. There's so many possible ways to build homes, it's ridiculous!   What Doesn't Work  Before I begin, a relevant side-note: I find myself often griping about how Steam game developers don't seem to have a good grasp on good UX (user-experience). UX is about using trends in how people actually use software, to make using  their  software easier and better to do. Chucklefish: you're next on the gripe-list.  My specific problems with the UX begin with the 'hot key' setup that is used in release. You can press buttons 1-6 to access a left-mouse/right-mouse item pair. Does that sound unintuitive? If you said 'yes', you summed up my thoughts. A more standard 'press 1-0 to use a certain item' setup would suit the game a lot better.  Now, before anyone says, 'But...Asvarduil! This game has a two-handed system where you can dual wield or use a shield with a 1 handed item, or all sorts of other stuff!' Unfortunately, this game has some balance problems where there's no good reason to use 1-handed items - they do far less damage than their 2h counterparts, and using a 1h weapon means you give up the secondary ability that 2h weapons bring to the table.  Getting back to UX, a problem is that key bits of useful information are hidden or non-obvious. In Survival difficulty, the hunger meter is unmarked - I didn't know I was hungry until my SAIL informed me that that dinging I heard meant I was hungry. Your current pixel count is not obvious either, which is a problem when you need to go shopping for items.  Getting away from UX, a higher-level problem I have is that the world generation algorithm doesn't take into account the fact that this game gives you the double-jump, morph ball, and dash mechanics through an easily-accessible sidequest series. The game would be more interesting if random worlds made it so that using those mechanics is easier than simply digging past obstacles.   The TL;DR  This one was a hard one, but I do, barely recommend it. The game in its release state has more good than bad in it. The mechanics can be a bit repetitive when they're not under utilized, and the UI alternates between good and unhelpful, but there's a good game behind those two major flaws.  This game is recommended  with the caveat that it will not be for everyone, possibly due to art style, possibly due to being yet another block-buildy survival game, and even due to this game's history. Nonetheless, this is far from the worst game I've played on Steam -  Star Trek Online  has that 'honor.'",

Other than that, it's really fun and I'm looking forward to updates with new content and planet variety, maybe a mix of ocean planets with other biomes, that would be sick to walk through the forest out onto a beach and a huge ocean, might make my next ocean base on something like that.",

For me the biggest problem is that the weapons and armour are just boring. The numbers just get bigger, there aren't any cool unique items that would alter the way you fight significantly, and no matter what level you're at, what armour you have, the most powerful armour available to you at any time always makes you feel weak (dead in 3 hits to almost all random enemies).

            "review_text": "Starbound review  In a nutshell, Starbound is Terraria in space. If you like 2D, block building pixel games then you are very lkely going to enjoy Starbound. The game does has its issues that make it a little tough to start but if you manage to get past the very slow introduction then you are in for an excellent game.  Let´s start with character creation. There are plenty of races to choose from, Humans, of course, then the monkey like Apex, the bird like Avians, the robotic Glitch race, and so on. There are 7 races to choose and your choice does affect the kind of ship you get, the weapons, armor and clothes you can craft, even doors are limited to certain races. After you make your character however, you have to experience one of the slowest burns ever.  After the introduction scene (which you can skip) you are stranded in space and all you have is a very damaged spaceship that can´t go nowhere and only limited resources. You then are forced to explore the planet currently in orbit and find that you need 20 core fragments as your first quest. Easy enough right? Well, no. You begin with no food, which is a necessity in any mode other than casual, with no armor and no food. So the first thing, as always, is to make a small shack to protect yourself, gather some resources and craft some stuff. Soon you´ll need ores, fabric and other stuff to make decent equipment. You need that equipment as the very first quest can only be completed in one of two ways. Either walk around until you find a mineshack that will have more than enough of the cores you need to collect, which requires heavy combat agaisnt the toughest enemies on the planet, or to make a hellevator. So you either fight your way through OR dig all the way to the core of the planet, something that you are not supposed to do in these kinds of games right off, in order to clear the very first quest of the game. So, you think you can travel space now? NOPE. You then have to complete a long, tedious dungeon before having your ship repaired. So can you travel now? Yes, but only to other planets in your current system. Traveling to other solar systems requires fuel which you can only gather on the moon, and even then you need to craft an EPP, a piece of equipment that allows you to breathe on planets with no atmosphere. Once you manage to do all that stuff you can finally do some exploring. The whole universe is finally open. If you haven´t given up on the game yet, then there is a lot of content for you.  In Starbound you can either do whatever you so long you have the appropiate equipment. You need to visit other planets in order to gather the next best resource. Instead of being divided by the depth, dificulty and the quality of materials are divided by the planet type. There are many types of planets, some of which you can´t visist right off. Planets like Lush or Forest, which are also the guaranteed start points are always available. Desert planets are also easy enough. Then you get Grassland and Ocean planets which are more difficult. Then Jungle, Mutated and Toxic planets that require an upgrade of the EPP. Then Cold and finally Hot planets, which require their own EPP upgrade. So when you start in the Lush or Forest planets you only get enough resources to explore the next kind of planet. In order to get to the Radiated planets you need to travel to the grasslands and collect Titanium, in order to get to Cold planets you need to go to Radiated planets and collect their resources and so on. While it keeps you from seeing everything right off it is very satisfying when you finally get a whole lot of resources to upgrade your equipment.  Combat in Starbound is dependent on weapons, and there is plenty of variety. There are the usual swords, which come in one handed and two handed, but there are also spears, whips, guns and plenty to choose from. Once you start exploring deeply you will find a whole lot of variety in weapons you might end up having to sell most of them to make space in your inventory. Combat is a little clunky when using one handed swords and guns, but it takes no time to get used to them.  Then there is crafting and gathering, and one of the most interesting, yet frustating features of Starbound, the Matter Manipulator. This thing pretty much does everything; digging, breaking blocks, mining, building, chopping trees, collecting vegetation. However, due to how the game progresses, the Manipulator starts off way too weak, which is agrgavating due to what you need to do first, dig to the core of the planet, it is a very annoying piece of equipment. You can upgrade it but it takes a long time before it becomes useful.   Despite some of the most frustrating mechanisms Starbound is a suprisingly fun game. If you liked Terraria and you manage to get past the introduction of the game, then you can be sure to have a great time. I highly recommend it.",

For those that don't have Terraria: In this game you mine resources, explore, craft, and otherwise progress from having nothing to having enough resources to build a massive city made of platinum (if you want to).   This game has a scifi theme, so you explore planets to get more resources, but you can always revisit old planets, build colonies there, and build teleporters to your old colonies so that you don't have to mess with your ship computer when you want to visit your neighbors. There is a basic story to tie together the random generation of objects, and to give you basic objectives to guide you from one planet to the next.  Pros:   infinite worlds, world layouts, creature types, etc.   Nice scifi theme   basic story that explains most of the randomness   gameplay to keep you occupied for hours   The story really helps you determine what your end goal should be, what materials you need to get there are mostly up to you.   active modding community for when you get bored of vanilla.   Cons:   Very unusual control scheme and UI for the genre, I recommend taking a look at the controls and rebinding them to your liking.   despite the search function, there are many crafting stations, and what items are crafted at what stations isn't always clear, which means going to several different stations if you can't remember where you need to go to craft that solid gold lamp post you want.   Lack of tutorial for more in-depth features. Different planets have different tiers of ore, but you would never know this unless you've just happened to know this from experience.    I don't even know how many hours into the game I am, and I still have yet to figure out how to relocate my adorable pet cat from my spaceship to my lovely house on planet 4321whatevertheheck.  ",

It is the most distant course that comes nearest to thyself, and that training is the most intricate which leads to the utter simplicity of a tune. The traveller has to knock at every alien door to come to his own, and one has to wander through all the outer worlds to reach the innermost shrine at the end. My eyes strayed far and wide before I shut them and said `Here art thou!'

Due to this basis, some of the things to consider about the games can be considered spoilers. as a more plain way of saying it, I'll say it now: SPOILER WARNING! Yellow Light Game: Although it is a fun game, there are some things to consider before buying it. I do recommend the game to people who can be considered old enough to play it.  Issues with the game: First and foremost, this game can use the steam workshop, which can have questionably appropriate content on it. However, wome of the content can also be useful, so you can basically apply internet safety rules to it. There are creatures and places in the game that I am concerned might give nightmares to some individuals. Please pay attention to the rating. Some of the scenes regarding the most liable of these to cause one is called the ruin, which is also the final boss of the game. A description of the encouter is depicted later. Then there is also a classical moonbase alien mystery. The game has quite a bit of violence in it, mostly defending yourself from wild animals, but one story map is a warzone in part of a civil war of an alien species.  Basics of the game: you travel the universe building structures, be it a large castle or a modest shelter, but can also tear things down, and recruit NPC crew members to your ship.  The game has a basic currency known as pixels, in which game mechanics extend precisely to buying and selling. At the start of the game, in the tutorial which can be skipped, your player is about to join the protectorate, a galactic peacekeeping organization. The ceremony is cut short by the arrival of the aforementioned ruin, of which all you can see of it this time is its countless tentacles. As your player leaves earth this creature is devouring earth from the inside.    The following, actually said while I was playing the game on the final map, will give you a good Idea why I have the concerns. This was a conversation between me and another player.  Me: I am at the ruin, how do I defeat this thing? ( thinks to self: oh, Please don't tell me I have to take it apart block by block.) Teammate: Poke it in the eye! Me: (Looking all around myself,) Which one? there's lots of them! Teammate: The main one! Me: What main one- oh. (Looks up at giant eye on the literal heart of the ruin.) Me: found it.  I saved the upsides for last. -The game has a peaceful side, including farming, building, and running a town built from the ground up. - most monsters you find can be tamed using devices called capture pods, which can be thrown at monsters to catch them. - The violent side of the game can be avoided completely.   The following are answers to the more commonly asked questions: Does it run well? yes. Does it have decent graphics? yes, otherwise I wouldn't be so concerned about it giving nightmares. Does it have plenty of content? yes.",

They will need to kill the enemies one by one until you get to the boss. The boss fights are very fun because of the variation. Some bosses you don't even have to damage and some you just have to shoot the SH%@ out of them. The best part is the colonies where you can build anything from small villages to HUGE futuristic cities.  -CONS The story is quite tedious because you will have to scan ALL of the different races stuff which gets REALLY annoying after a while. Also, You will need to mine EXTREMELY much. 'Oh that seems easy'. Well it is but you will have to CLIMB ALL THE WAY UP TO THE SURFACE.

Each and every planet you land on is different, and on these planets you will find quests available and plenty of loot to be had. The game's controls are tight and responsive, making combat enjoyable, and the boss fights are great; just as good as Terraria's.

Mine, Craft, Kill, Loot, Search, Repeat goes for most of the quests. The fact that the late game quests require you to search all of these planets for a building you will never see is painful.

My system is a bit above the minimum requirements, so the game should at least run relatively smoothly on the game's minimum settings. However, I own games I shouldn't even be able to run in the first place, and they run like I could play them any day. Even the games I have that lag a bit on their respective lowest settings actually have a playable framerate.  Starbound provides me with a nigh-nonexistent framerate. Attempts at playing the game past the main menu result in what I would refer to as a slideshow; any expectation of smooth movement is but a mere pipe dream. Movement is delayed, and to call it 'choppy' would be overgratifying it. It takes me over a whole minute to go from the end of the first dialogue box of the 'Start game' cutscene (where your character wakes up) to making it to the first door of the first room, a process that takes mere seconds in proper gameplay. I've tried every possible fix, workaround, etc to no success. Looking into the issue, it seems I'm not the only one experiencing these problems.  I'll happily re-review the game once I get an opportunity to actually play it, but until the issue is fixed or I get a NASA Supercomputer, my review will remain negative.",

It is a fun game with promise, is highly customisable, and has a almost non-cancerous and helpful community. It has fully working, moddable multiplayer and a complete story to it. The planets are challanging, but fun to explore and walk around. You can make your own colonies, houses, whatever you dream of. There are quests you can do for people in YOUR OWN colony, and if you do enough, they will actually join your ship crew! This just launched from early access (as of review writing), so i was expecting some bugs, you guys should of too.   But they removed cool stuff and stuff is broken!  Okay then, if you want stuff back, just get a mod and report any bugs, the will still update and work on the game for pretty long i've heard.  I shoudn't need a mod!  Well, some stuff was either removed becuase of problems or it wasn't/ dIdn't fit into the game style. Getting a mod is stupidly easy, even if you don't want to use the steam workshop. Making a item yourself is easy as well, all you need is MS paint and notepad (I don't know the linux alternatives, sorry :P).  I shoudn't need a mod to fix a bug!  Calm down! It LITERALLY JUST released from early access! Like i said, they plan to work on the game for a long while.  Why should i belive YOU?  You don't have to. There are (as of writing this review) tens of thousands of players playing the game, and the negative reviews are way in the minority of people playing (currently 89% [very positive] approval raiting on steam).  So, who are you going to believe, the 89% who are playing the game and like it or the 11% who are complaining about stuff that can be adder or fixed with a couple of clicks?  TL*DR: This game is great, don't listen to all the haters who are complaining about a game that just launched from early access.",

Instead I guess they wanted it to be a difficult action platformer, like a 2d Dark Souls or a really hard SotN? Except a) they didn't seem able to implement that vision coherently and b) no one liked or wanted that. So after years of development, after years of making terrible changes in the name of 'balance' and enforced progression (in a largely-single-player sandbox game), after years of methodically removing the good and fun things (sand mining and the good grappling hook, just to name a few), after adding content which just straight-up ignores the basic premise of the game (the plot dungeons where you arbitrarily can't use the matter manipulator)... after ALL that, what we are left with is basically 'Terraria, but much less good.'

The worlds are fairly unique and the races have unique looks (though little else.) Combat, if you have the right weapons, can be fun but more often than not ends up being an awkward dance where you strike, jump back, wait to be able to attack again, repeat. Weapons lack variety in almost all cases, with a few outliers. The bosses are all boring and predictable and not very smort. Most of the features are hollow at best.   Get a vehicle? Sure, it's speedy, but that's about it. Can't transport escort NPCs or anything in them. Upgrade your equipment? Sure, but you're looking at like, six tiers total. Build a colony? Yep, but you only get the occasional pixels in return for your investment of time. Quests? Sure, but you're mostly running back and forth six-seven times and your rewards are seeds.  Also, the storyline is pretty horrific in my opinion. Ultimately though, I think that the core here can develop into something awesome. Just... wait a little longer before jumping in.",

Things i find the most jarring: Features that were promised are still missing,  Progression through the story is a looparound that just keeps on repeating itself,  The story itself was stripped of the original racial devide, Aforementioned point turned the races into something purely cosmetic, If you check the wiki of removed things there are propably more things there than in the game, i could go on, but i think the point is clear.

            "review_text": "TL;DR Short Review: It looks like Terraria, but it's not. It has similarities, but the actual gameplay is different enough to warrant trying out. I've found it fun so far and I poured a lot of time into Terraria.  I went into this worried that it would be Terraria 2.0, or a weaker Terraria. Luckily, I was wrong.  Where Terraria has you on a single, but evolving map and relatively limited resources with a bigger focus on building and npc collection with bosses being a source of progression and even crafting materials, Starbound has tons of 'different' planets with varying climates, entire npc villages, and less focus on building(though you can build just as much as in Terraria if you want to and with way more material variety)  Pros:  Better Digging system - leftclick for foreground objects, rightclick for background - Ores can spawn on the background, too. No Tier-limiting, you can dig anything you see, it will just be slower until you upgrade the tool. Starts off digging 2x2 area with Shift hotkey to dig 1 square, can be upgraded to 5x5 as well as upgrading the speed, as well as the range, and the ability to harvest ANY Liquids with it, whether it's simple water/lava, or Oil, Poison, Swamp Water, etc.   Quests - NPC Villages offer randomized quests that always reward a Random Loot Bag, which could contain vendor fodder, or a nice weapon upgrade. Also a Main Story that helps those of us that don't like to grind for the sake of grinding feel more involved and with a proper goal that isn't just 'progress through the gear tiers'. More 'Traditional' progression then fight a boss and repeat.   Material Variety - Wanna make piles of treasure for walls and live like Scrooge McDuck? You can! not just shiny gold bricks but literal piles of coins. Wanna live in garbage heap? There's junk piles and Post-Apocalyptic-style blocks &amp; decor too! Prefer a steampunk look? They got literal gears in the walls.   World 'Variety' - I use quotes because, let's face it, Random Generation can only be so random. Worlds will feel like Terraria's, except there's no left and right edge - it loops around, you can literally walk around the world and end up where you started. There's random caves, most of which do eventually connect in some way so just exploring you'll find your way to the 'Deep Lava Sea' at the bottom of the map; there's nothing below it, so once you reach it, you're done there. There's some biomes per-planet, a deep cave might suddenly turn to an ice cave, and a ruined dusty wasteland on the surface might suddenly turn into a volcanic one.   Cosmetic Slots and options right from the start - You find a hat you like? Slap it in the Cosmetic slot. They even have a Back/Cape slot if you prefer to be all heroic and ♥♥♥♥. At the time of this review, my char currently looks like ♥♥♥♥ing Darth Vader with a Neopolitan Ice Cream sword.   Good Workshop Mod Community - There's a ton of good mods for this game on the workshop, from simple things like making crops only take up 1 tile, to an Automated Gardening Robot mod, to entire overhauls like Fracken' Universe that adds enough content to the game to make it worth a whole new, but difficult, playthrough(as it adds ♥♥♥♥ like molten iron rain that can melt your base, entirely new threats as well as tons of new things to make and do)   Neutral:  The Scan System - So your digging tool also has a 'Scanner' built in that you can use to not only be a flashlight you can't lose, but also Scans any objects in range - it will highlight new items in Blue, and previously-scanned ones in reddish-orange. However, this is also tied to the Main Story Quest - you HAVE to scan a certain # of items from a specific race to 'locate' each Race's artifact, and these will show up in Green on your scan highlight. Problem is, you may not find all you need on a single planet. I've been stuck on the Bird one for a few planets now, 2 whole cities of bird people and still only about 85-90% done with that part of the quest. I sat for awhile on the Plant people one too, but my Crew was Flora and sometimes talking to them would progress the quest progress slightly until it finished. -- Scanning DOES have a purpose though! Later on, you get a crafting station that lets you craft anything you've scanned so far, so if you ever found something neat you'd like in your base but it wasn't common or harvestable, bam, there ya go.   Cons:  Crewmen - Their AI is absolutely ♥♥♥♥. Their damage is also absolutely ♥♥♥♥. The worst example is the now-optional boss, Dreadwing: Your crew mates won't attack his non-tank penguin minions at all. So they'll sit there picking you all off, and their dmg is nothing to laugh at on top of Dreadwing himself constantly assaulting you. They'll shoot Dreadwing, occasionally, though. But their damage is also ♥♥♥♥ so they kinda stand there, do piddly damage, and eventually die leaving you alone. They're hit and miss on normal exploration too, an extra defense but their dmg is nearly negligable against mobs. Stuff that takes me 2-3 sword swings to kill, they can spend 5mins shooting at and will probably die before their target does. The Penguin Mercs are a little better(which are unlocked by beating the aforementioned Dreadwing) but not by much. Even the only mod on the workshop for them only boosts their health and a few other things, their dmg and ai still sucks.   Fall Damage is much deadlier in this game and kicks in seemingly sooner. This makes the Double or Multi-jump tech skill completely required to negate fall damage when you take a leap of faith, and even then you fall so fast it's hard to tell sometimes and you may miss and die anyways. There are no Horse Shoe trinkets and the like here to negate that.   Monster AI - From what I understand, they toned down the RNG on monsters, as they used to be procedurally generated with various 'parts' and AIs - so far, almost all I've seen have been either 1) Birds/Bats with the same 'swoop at you and hug you' AI, 2) Tons of slightly diff looking Quadriped lizards that charge at you, 3) Ghosts that charge at you, 4) Things that spit at you, and 5) Humanoids that either stand still and shoot you, even if you go out of los they'll wait till you come back in range, or they whip out melee instead and take their sweet time swinging at you. Overall, the AI is very samey and lazy. Though to be fair, not many games do good AI these days. You'd think being nearly 30 years after the early PC games we'd have better AI by now though.  ",

            "review_text": "This is what I wanted terraria to be. It's not minecraft in the slightest, more of a Star Trek/RPG mashup. I believe I only cut down a tree twice, and shot a laser gun a million times. Unlike terraria it actually has direction and a story, the bosses feel more important, the combat feels more fluid, there's no boring ammo crafting (it uses an energy system instead), and there's quests. You can upgrade your ship from an escape pod to a Star Destroyer by either making friends/crewmates or acquiring cold hard cash. In Terraria I never really felt like I was progressing but in this game it's clear where you should be and how you can upgrade. There's plenty of weapon types and 'special attack's that make sure you can focus on one specific type of weapon while still feeling like each gun is different. I had a sniper rifle whose special attack was shooting a dart that exploded when the enemy died for some aoe damage and I had a sniper rifle whose special attack was practically 'It's High Noon'. In Starbound you can travel between different worlds and on those worlds you can find tons of different cool stuff. An example is   an underground tiny gnome village getting attacked by a giant (size of you) robot. If you crush the houses you can grab the gnomes and use them as a throwing weapon. They scream when you throw them.   This type of stuff adds so much to the exploration aspect of Starbound. Lastly, and this is just my opinion, but I feel like Starbound's pixel art and animations make Terraria look like a 9 year old's deviantart page turned into a flash game.",

Be warned though, if games like this suck up your time, this one will do the same.   There is only one problem I have with the game, and that's a lack of a beam up hotkey. Google says that dozens, if not hundreds (perhaps thousands) of players have requested this feature since 2012, yet no developer has ever seemed to respond, even if to say 'we've purposely left that feature out and will never be adding it'  Beyond that one very minor and VERY annoying problem, this game is amazing, and I very highly recommend it.",

The tech menu and the vehicle repair menu cause the game to crash when you do anything to close them, and I can't load my ship once I finish a mission, and that has really been slowing my progress.

A big thing that I loved about the older versions of starbound was the simplicity of modding and the limitless possibilities they had, although recently it has reasonably been a bit harder to actually do 'vanilla modding' as I like to call it (E.g. generated items), which makes sense so the new players can actually go onto servers without running into someone who has something that is impossible to get in vanilla game or just giving those simple 'modders' (like me) have a chance to actually experience vanilla for the first time and enjoy the story.

The races are all really unique, and they all have reasoning behind why they follow the themes they have.

Granted, there are gameplay elements I really wish had been included, but they aren't here, so meh. For what it is, which is nothing more than Terraria in space, the game works.  The caveat? Frustration is legion in this game. Starbound probably has more things potentially wrong with it than many games I've played, even though I'm enjoying playing it. There are graphical glitches galore, even with a decent computer rig. Some of the early gameplay seems dead-set on killing a new player at every opportunity. The most annoying element, however, is how long it takes just to get the main part of the game going, even if you already know what to do beforehand. Having to do five things first just to accomplish one thing is stupid and inefficient. Going on a fetch quest as a main part of what is essentially a tutorial almost killed the enjoyment for me. Just, dude, fix my ship first, and THEN I'll be happy to go do your scut work.  Anyway, I also rerolled my character four times before finding a starting planet that was worth the frustration. Lots of stuff to find and use, with the potential as a quite nice base of operations in the opening hours of play. Hopefully, my experiences will continue to improve from here.  So I recommend the game, but new players with no previous knowledge of this or any other game in this genre should be prepared for as much misery as fun starting out. Once you get some decent weaponry and such, the game does get much easier, and more fun. So enjoy...if you can.",

            "review_text": "Far from finished and not user friendly at all. Get Terraria instead.  What I had to do to craft something fairly basic: 1. Chop down several trees, mine some cobblestone, mine ore, and mine some coal. 2. Press C find timber since that is different than wood for some reason... 3. Build basic craft item with timber (and wait for the timer to build it). 4. After building that, interact with it via E since the items you can craft with it don't show up in the regular craft menu. 5. Find out I need more timber so escape twice, C, craft timber, espace, E to interact again. 6. Build basic workbench to find out I need to go back and forth between my craft menu and the workbenches craft menu to craft anything more advanced than timber or the like.  After this I gave up and decided to explore the planet a bit. Ow every form of life instantly wants to kill me so no intelligent life found (even though I found a small hut in the middle of nowhere). Sigh, lets die a lot since the enemies charge at you with a rate that you sometimes just can't bounce them back via attacking.  So let's explore and jump over enemies since they have a rubbish AI and just drop 'pixels' which is money you need to craft which I'm not going to do since I don't enjoy it in any way. Die a lot exploring because of lots of sudden drops in the environment...  After this I uninstalled the game and refunded it since I'm not going to place torches everywhere if I don't like crafting them. I might give it a second chance in the future when things are more finished, but right now it simply can't compete with Terraria since I enjoy just about everything more in that game. My reasons to choose Terraria over this: Crafting can be done from a single menu so you don't have to switch between different crafting menu's and what you need to craft things is clearer because you don't have to hover over craftable things to view what you need. A plus for this game with crafting is that you can show recipes for which you don't have the resources yet, but that's about it. Exploring felt more logical with less sudden drops unless you are at the corrupted area's or the jungle. Even then the torches were really easy to make since you only have to kill one of the most common enemies and use a bit of wood to create 3 of them. Combat has more variety pretty much from the get go since you can craft different weapons quite easily like regular swords, broadswords or bows. Even if you don't have any desire to create a weapon you can use your mining pickaxe to fight so you don't have to waste space for a weapon. I 44 minutes of playing this game I found 3 whole weapons if I include the starter sword and the weapons didn't feel different in any way (even using the same attack animations).",

            "review_text": "For those who will read only the first sentence here, I recommend it if your computer is good, but wait for the performance update if you're on a budget laptop like mine.  -  Alright, so Starbound is finally out after so many years of early access. It was the first early access game I ever purchased, soon after it became available, simply because I believed in the concept. But it's been a rocky ride to 1.0 with lots of changes from that initial plan and, even though I'm giving it a thumbs up, the road still looks kinda rocky ahead.  Starbound is a mixture of a procedural sandbox game and something with a plot. The sandbox is similar to Terraria, but with different strengths and weakness. Terraria has more interesting enemies and combat in general, but I'd say that starbound feels stronger to me in the exploration department, and has a huge variety of collectables up if you're into that kind of thing. If you want to farm, explore surfaces, explore caves, capture monsters to kill stuff for you, do quests, learn about and talk to all the different races, you can find something to do. What kinks there are in the exploration system mainly result from the fact that the planets are tiered, like the equipment, which makes things rather awkward at the end of the time, but it's still pretty fun to run around and look at things in a way that Terraria can't possibly match.   Starbounds story isn't too special, at least not the main plot, and the most intriguing background pieces of information on each race were removed/rewritten before release, unfortunately, as the leading baddies of some races were sacrificed in the name of focusing on the big cosmic baddie. The plot mainly seems to be a vehicle for the developer designed missions, which are interesting to explore if not much of a challenge so far (I'm not too far in, but the last boss I fought killed me several times until I realized she wasn't really reacting to me most of the time and so I could win mostly by standing in a particular safe spot). How difficult the bosses are in each mission and what equipment you should probably have before doing it isn't really communicated all that well. Moreover, the missions/story seem like a place where they should have forgone the random quest reward bag in favor of cool, specific things, especially at the end of the game (where it would be nice to unlock some kind of sandbox God powers to reduce the grind and make movement easier), but nope, just the same random rewards you get for escorting a villager back to their friend. Still, it manages to not come off as incredibly cheesy, like Freedom Planet (which is great game for other reasons, don't grab your pitchforks please).  So overall I would recommend the game if you're looking for an easy-going romp through space. I wouldn't say it's amazing, but then I just spent my entire weekend playing it, so it's certainly good enough to recommend.  However, this is ONE LARGE CAVEAT that I noted at the top here:  Performance issues. If your computer is a 5 year old budget laptop like mine, wait before you buy. The devs are planning the next patch to be the one that fixes the performance issues and, I have to say, during early access I didn't have any problems. But 1.0 introduced a huuuuuge amount of lag and loading problems I never experienced before. It's never killed me but it really breaks immersion and is flat out inconvenient when you get to watch the edge of the world pop into existence after 15 seconds, or you teleport to the outpost and nothing can move (npcs, doors) but you and you have to wait 30 seconds before the game catches up and staggers forward for you. Weather effects never used to cause me more than a slight framerate drop but now, combined with whatever else the game is trying to do, they seriously cause my poor integrated-graphics machine to chug. It has been mostly playable, that's the only reason I've gotten as far as I have, but geez, it *really* freezes up my machine in a way it never did during early access.  That about sums it up. I hope this is useful for you guys.",

It kept and exspanded opon the endless exsploring with new bioms (Mini bioms are nice but to little in size and to few/hard to find), new creatures, new races (NON-PLAYABLE) and weapons with amazing abilitys. But its not the same as the original.  The original had memerable bosses, amazing armor, uniqe wepons and some memerable wepons such as The Slave Sword and The Bone Hammer (which is still in but you cant get. A Floran has in in the hunting mission). Also has lore for each of the races. Such as Green Finger-Floran Lore, Big Ape-Apex Lore, Kluex-Avian Lore, some of which are still in game but you dont get nearly as much lore as before.  This version (1.0) has a story which i think is slow, hard to complete becouse of all the forced exsploring, Luck, and scanning, also uninteressting characters, lack of lore from races (KLUEX, BIG APE, WHERE DID THE LORE GO!?!), but perferably i like the ending (SPOILER FREE) the picture at the end (its a Codex) actualy give the story line characters enough personality that you feel like you might of has a slight connection to them through the struggle. Some of the bosses/battles are a bit repetitive and over all more fustrating, Sometimes you dont feel like you have good enough items for them, your damage is minuscule, your defence at max isn't high enough, you need to constenly apply healing items just so you don't die in a matter of seconds. But while on the topic of bosses i love how they brought back one from the beggining (SPOILER-SKIP TO NEXT LINE) The Bone Dragon. Of corse its diffrent and is actually a robotic machine, but its still cool to have that nodd to the old times. The legendairy weapons that use to exsist have been replaced with others. Some are AMAZING, others are stupid. The boomerang? The Gautlet? The Worm? Weak, Late Game, Stupid. The boss ones however, as rare as they are, are op depending on your play style, such as a sword that can slow enemys, a 1-handed mini rocket launcher. The thing i hate the most IS THE FREAKING HOTBAR! IT'S STUPIDLY DESIGNED and should honestly be replaced with the older one.  In Short, the game is still good. MY POINT OF VIEW!!! Is it as good as the original? No. Are the bosses good? No. Is it fun? Yes Is it replayable? Only if you want achivements, to build, to get the best stuff, or to discover new biomes. Is it worth the $15? Sorta. Is there divercity with play styles? YES, Soport, Mage, Gunner, Tank, Melee Fighter, Bullet Sponge, SO MUCH MOAR!!! The Story? Suck, Repetitive, annoying, but the ending is kinda worth it.  I still love this game, but it still has a lot that it has to live up to. Mostly, it's past. Bring back the old bosses even if its for some small side mission or as a mini boss. Bring back the old legendairy weapons, bring back the old tech, bring back the racial lore, Bring back Starbound Beta. Im not saying replace the entier game with beta, just bring back stuff from the beta.",

If it weren't for the tsunami of bugs this game currently has, I might of rated it positive. Right now, the amount of bugs present is really unjustifiable. Even though you could argue that my pc crashing is not the games fault, there've been a scarying amount of crashes that were entirely on the games end. Legitimately, I sometimes only lasted 30 seconds into the game before it blacked out and forced me to use task manager to close it.  To sum it all up, this game is pretty good when it doesn't crash, despite all the poor decisions chucklefish made, and will probably get better within 1-6 months. Currently, I have to say I do not recommend.",

You are unable to progress anymore, making the player have to search planets repetitively for items which they need to find, not want to. Not only that, but after 2 years of its release, the Novakids have yet to be implemented as a npc race, and although you can play as 1, you are unable to find others to interact with.

            "review_text": "Starbound has been through a lot in its years of development, and since launching in an Early Access state. The game has seen tireless and curiously persistent detractors, dedicated fanbase and mod enthusiasts, and regular old players constantly cycle through the process of complaining about lack of features, and then complaining once they have been put in. But today, Starbound has reached 1.0, where it is released to the masses as a full game. And it's a good one.  Pros: +Colony building has come a LONG ways since the game's earliest versions, and you have reason and motivation to build big and build nice on a planet. Citizens have personality, give off quests, and can be controlled for by architecture style. +Farming, hunting, and food in general feel much more viable in the game now. These mechanics bounced back and forth between overbearing and underwhelming, but now have meaning without being a burden. +Combat is exciting, intuitive, and skill dependent. Plenty of room to build skill and be a dodge king, but also to stack gear for those of us less skilled. Additionally, there is great weapon variety and it feels exciting to loot new stuff. +EXPLORATION. This is a big universe. 2D No Man's Sky. Incomprehensibly many stars, planets, monsters, weapons, everything due to refined and well-made procedural generation. This is honestly why I play the game, because there is ALWAYS something new to explore and a new dungeon to crawl. +Story. See, Starbound didn't have a story once. Or, if it did, it was so bad nobody noticed it. Not so now. You're here to avenge the Earth, and characters and dialogue have been reworked so as to  not be cancer  be fitting for a full-release game. +Building mechanics in this game are far and away the best I've yet seen. Terraria? Not even close. Minecraft? It's got 3D but a lot less potential for detail. You wanna build a castle the size of an entire planet? You build that castle. Wanna make a 3-mile-wide underground base full of scientists? Start digging. It's all possible.  So-So Points  +/- Multiplayer. Multiplayer has come a long way as well, and is serviceable now, but I don't think it's in a state which can be considered perfect. Maybe servers are under heavy load right now, but Steam-based servers aren't too great, and private hosting is still confusing. +/- I feel like the tech system could use a bit more expanding. It just seems less imaginitive now than in the past (but also decidedly less OP). However, it still serves to augment your gameplay and combat, and is a welcome tool.  Bad Bits  - Some quests are poorly written or just plain boring. Too many fetch quests for my liking, not enough slaughter. This isn't all quests, and the story itself is quite good, but many of them are just not fun or even frustrating. - Some parts of progression are still a bit unclear. One example is upgrading your Inventor's Table or whatever it's called. Some basic things, like making bread out of wheat, appear to need that upgrade, and that's not clearly laid out.   There's a lot more I could say about this game, but it just won't fit. This is by far the largest game I've ever played in terms of content and potential, and has been lovingly crafted by its devs.  tl;dr An excellent game, far exceeds its predecessors (Terraria ahem) and is much more fun and balanced now than at original Early Access launch. Game mechanics are top-tier, story has been well done, but some questing mechanics leave me uneasy.  8.5/10 overall, but honestly, with how much replayability and timesink potential exists, it can easily be a 9.5/10.",

            "review_text": "Hey look! I'm writing a serious review of this game! Waow! First off, this game is great. With the seemingly endless tide of medicore survival/exploration games that are released with numerous glitches and bugs, Starbound stands out as one of the few that not only doesn't totally suck, but is actually actively worked on by the devs. (I'm looking at you Dayz standalone)   1. Crafting The crafting in this game is pretty standard, you have to gather materials, build your workstations and what not. It is much better than the crafting in game like Minecraft or Terraria, because you don't have to memorize any recipes and everything is well organized under the specific crafting stations.  2. Exploration The exploration element in this game is phenomenal, mainly due not to the large number of planets, but to the structures and villages that are generated on them. The ability to travel between planets only adds to the fun.  3. Combat Combat in this game is pretty much the same as most 2D games, although the game seems to be able to generate an almost infinite amount of weapons. This keeps the combat relatively interesting, and in early game when you won't have much food, it can be quite challenging.  4. Story And here we are. The bad part. The story is unfortunately this games major weak point. There is almost nothing interesting about it, just the good old 'ancient evil was sealed away by some really powerful good guy but now it's free so you have to beat it up' story from countless other fantasy stories. In addition, about half of the story missions suck. And I mean really suck. I would prefer an escort mission where the AI goes down random streets for no reason, because at least I can get mad at that. The missions in this game though, are just: Find clues pertaining to ____ race. How do you find these clues? With your handy dandy scanner. This means that entire missions are dedicated to just running around villages clicking ♥♥♥♥, just so that you can go through one of the larger story mode dungeons. After every dungeon, some random character with zero development will join your space station. Yipee. And we are on to the next problem with the story. Characters. The characters and quests in the main story of the game are WAY less interesting the randomized side quests you get in villages. If you take the time to read the descriptions of the side quests, you can find some true gems. Things like, 'I overheard some Miniknog scientists discussing science. Could you go check it out?' Then I went and killed a bunch of scientists and got a reward bag. I had more fun in that one minute side quest than I did in 30 minutes of story missions.  5. Things that should be in the game but are not. This fifth and final category is simply for things that would make good additions to the game that I hope they add. A. Space battles. This seriously needs to be a thing. B. Ship customization. Having your ships look be decided by what race you are is fine, but you should be able to customize the outer hull to your liking while at the space station. C. More races, this one is a given, it would be cool to have more races running around. D. Planets that are entirely populated. This means that you could look at a planet, and it would have a little icon of the race that had colonized it. It could have massive cities, with different districts. E. Home planets. The ability to travel to other species homeworlds would be amazing. F. The ability to see the moons and other planets in a solar system while on a planets surface.  Starbound: 8.8/10",

            "review_text": "This is a very fun sandbox RPG that is heavily inspired by Terraria. Only instead of focusing on building your character and combat, Starbound focuses on exploring planets, pillaging dungeons, and upgrading your ship and tools.  Starbound's combat is less spammy and more tactical than Terraria is. As a result, coming from Terraria you will probably struggle a bit to get used to it, but once you do the combat is very fun and does a good job encouraging position and timing to better your enemy.  There is a lot of variety to the gameplay. One minute you will be playing a minesweeper-esque minigame to collect fossils. Another you will be building a colony to attract potential new members to your crew. And after that you could be chased by horrifying ghosts as you mine fuel for your ship on a local moon. There are also several side quests, and while the randomly generated ones in colonies are rather lackluster the main side quests in the outpost are diverse. One quest has you taking down a giant UFO manned by a penguin in an arctic campsite. Another can pitch you against powerful enemies in an arena. You could also be doing obstacle courses for new techs and farming cotton to make a teddy bear for a family.  The weapon system is similar to that of Borderlands. You will get most of your weapons from looting dungeons and as rewards from some of the quest lines. These weapons are all procedurally generated (except for a few unique rare weapons like a bada** flamethrower). Basically find the ones you want and use them! Although when you move to the next tier in the game you should probably find new weapons with better stats.  You would think mining for ores would be kind of boring, but thanks to the variety of minibiomes underground (the minibiomes you find depending on the planet) each with its own set of enemies, in addition to well connected cave systems that minimize digging around (you really only need to dig down from the surface to start mining and the caverns handle the rest of the traveling), mining is interesting and fun. You also sometimes come across cool stuff like an underground science lab and an underground bandit fort!  I have a few gripes with this game, though. First of all, exploring planet surfaces isn't really that exciting of an experience. Most of any planet is empty landscape. Fortunately later in the game you get access to hoverbikes to make that one dungeon on a planet faster to find. There are some interesting surface biomes, but despite this surface exploring is pretty meh. It is a shame, too, since exploring planets was meant to be a major focus of this game. Fortunately the dungeons themselves are actually fun to explore and pillage, and there are plenty of activities between running laps around planets in Starbound.  Also, what is the actual point of ocean, toxic, arctic, and magma planets? You only go to an ocean planet to find a hylotl city for story progression, and the latter three are only useful as infinite liquid supplies. I wish there was more to these vast liquid wastelands. Currently it isn't really worth exploring them.  Also the UI can be aggravating at times. By default your inventory opens up over the character and you need to move it out of the way. But when you open a container or shop it resets back to the center. There is a very easy to install and tiny mod that fixes this problem somewhat, but still I wish the UI menus were better handled than this. Also the inventory icons are too small. I have to squint my eyes a lot to find that one furniture from my inventory to place into a colony house.  While exploring a planet's surface isn't nearly as exciting as it could be, and the UI can be troublesome at times, I recommend Starbound. It is a fun, relaxing experience that you can beat in only a few hours or in over 20 hours depending on how much of the side content you do. Progression in Starbound is like being a bug in a bush. You can climb to the top very quickly if you want, but by doing so you are missing the vast majority of what the bush has to offer from its large width.",

            "review_text": "Note: Finished main progression now, about halfway through the story. Will update review on story if opinion changes.  Wow. What a journey. When Tiyuri first started saying that he left the Terraria team to work on his own game I was hyped. I was excited when the website went up. I read the dev posts and when footage of the game got released it looked like exactly what I was hoping for in a Terraria successor. The weapons I find are unique and amazing, the story ( playing as a human with apex and glitch friends ) is enticing and a little sad. You feel something different depending on your race. Humans will feel incredibly lonely. Apex will feel free when examining their race's 1984 type cities. Glitch will, well, chivalry n ♥♥♥♥.  First off, the main progression. From copper to solarium. The costs of gear are now relatively low, allowing for rapid progession and more time to do the main story and explore. But attaining the resources in the first place? Who'd have thought you could make it so varied? When I first figured out where to get free fuel, the surprises lying in wait made me go ' maybe i'll just buy it and start mining it when I have better gear '. I won't spoil anything, but something changes each tier. Maybe armour will begin to branch off, maybe a new enemy will attempt to stop you. For anyone who's played Terraria, you'll understand the basic gist of it. But Starbound's procedurally generated planets and enviroments make looking for ore that much fun. Even looking for cosmetics or furniture is a blast. Are you looking for some Apex furniture? They set up their cities on frozen planets, so look around there. But doesn't this look different from the last frozen planet you were on?  Yes, it does. Starbounds planet generation has improved massively since the beta. Planets now have their own mini-biomes depending on the location of the sun. The planet might be described as a volcanic planet, but this planet will have jungles, rivers and deserts. Some planets will be predictable. You probably guessed that ocean planets are mainly large bodies of water. But even then, the floor of these oceans will have their own secrets to explore. I never got bored of exploring planets, even if they were supposed to be similar.  The story starts off strong and incorporates itself into the main game really well. It revolves around items you have to discover by going to pre-made dungeons and fighting bosses. In order to find these dungeons you must find clues in settlements of a specific race. You're given clues as to where to find these settlements and finding one with the info you need becomes hugely satisfying. I'm not done with it yet but it so far seems pretty good.  Co-op has been made much easier, with Steam allowing drop-in drop-out co-op for up to 4 players. More than 4, however, will require dedicated servers to be made by one of your friends. The steam servers seem relatively strong, with little latency between me and my friends save for some spotty bits during long-distance games.   Overall, this is definitely an essential for fans of sci-fi exploration. Also a must-buy for fans of Terraria. Everything ties in really well and it's exactly what I expected. While multiplayer with more than 4 friends can be a hassle and the game still lacks a few features, ( I get the idea of finding a cute stowaway, but I'm not a cat person. I just want a dog, dammit. Now I'm stuck with this feline that doesn't eat anything I feed it. ) the game is a solid 9/10. They plan to support the game with updates after release, so this could change to a 10/10 if they add features the community are asking for. So what are you waiting for? Go Starbound already!",

Everything is gone.  So now I have to spend another 30 minutes doing that? That would be cool, if I had any fun whatsoever drilling down in the first place.  The player control physics are terrible really, if they could make moving around a joy, then maybe drilling down into that mine would have been fun. Instead there is pretty much no acceleration, the tiniest touch of the 'left' key and your character moves too far (the reason I lost 30 minutes of progress). I want the character to start moving slowly and accelerate frame by frame, that'd be nice. Some cool jump physics.  I doubt I will ever play this game again.",

Release - What the hell where's the race specific weapons and SAIL why are quests still here why is this game still garbage  Basically what I'm saying is that the game is still basically the same as the beta, but they removed early game stuff and added stupid things. For example, they removed the backstory for different races, and just lumped it together as 'you're fleeing earth' which doesn't make sense. They also got rid of the space specific SAIL characters, and replaced them with some generic looking bald dude who changes color based on race. The pacing of the game is still really slow, making the game feel boring and dull, unlike other games like Terraria (which I mentioned) which has a more natural pace letting the player progress as she/he wishes. In Starbound, you can't explore other planets or do anything substantial without mining a whole lot, which ruins the game for me. But hey, that's just my opinion, so take it as you will.",

            "review_text": "Going to come back for a full review later, but here's my quick review:  Gameplay: Really good, especially if you like platformers or sandbox games, or anything like Terraria. A lot of mechanics are similar to Terraria but definitely different enough to be it's own game. It's much tougher, HP doesn't regen, the energy system means you have to be smart with your weapon and tech usage, fall damage can kill you very easily, for instance. Exploration is very fun and rewarding, although it can get a bit repetitive after a while. There are TONS of different planets occupied by lots of different mobs and several races that have their own unique settlements, as well as dungeons, biomes, loot, quests etc etc there isn't a shortage of things to do. Movement feels fluid and fun and combat is really surprisingly involved and strategic.   Sound and music: Awesome. I love the soundtrack in this game, and all the sound effects for mining, combat etc sound great and perfectly fit into the sci-fi sandbox world.  Story: Definitely needs some work, but it appears the devs are fully aware of this and are working hard to expand it, which is great because what is there definitely works. The main quest is fun and the bosses are tough but fulfilling once beaten, and the different races and characters are all very charming and lovable. The game has tons of personality, so I'm very excited to see the direction the devs take with it.   Graphics: Pretty much what you'd expect, maybe a little better than Terraria. Pretty pixel art with a lot of love put into it. The characters are well designed, the races are very imaginative and look great. The world(s) itself is really neat, I don't know to what extent the worlds are procedurally generated but they are very well put together look beautiful. It all feels very alive.   A couple miscellaneous points:      I would like to see more biome diversity. As it is the different biomes look really pretty but they mostly play the same, and the underground layers don't seem to have too much variety.     One thing that I prefer about Terraria is the equipment system (including weapons, armor, accessories etc). In Terraria each piece of equipment seems unique, and it's a great feeling to take two awesome items and combine them into an even more awesome item, or to farm a boss or mob just to get that one special item. Starbound's weapons are mostly randomly generated and all feel somewhat similar, and armor is mostly just what you craft (and there aren't too many options at the moment). This is okay but I feel deserves more depth.     The Matter Manipulator is one of my favorite mechanics in this game. Instead of a typical pickaxe, shovel, axe, etc. you have a dedicated tool for all of your matter manipulating needs, including digging, mining, building, placing and removing objects and walls, gathering liquids, etc. This also includes an upgrade system with upgrades like faster manipulation speed and increasing the size of the area you can manipulate.      Expansion of the tech system is a must. Techs add functionality to your character mostly in the form of movement upgrades, like double jump, dash, or what is basically a morph ball. There used to be lots of cool tech upgrades but now it's just the three I listed with three (sort of) upgrades for each of them.   All in all, I love the game. I anticipate putting many more hours into it and I'm very excited for whatever the devs come up with next.",

Starbound is one of those games that's good with a few mods and/or friends/servers to ♥♥♥♥ around with. Worth the price tag.    ...Of course, I suppose you want a far less concise review, so here you go.   Starbound is a 2D sidescrolling sandbox; you can think of it in a way as a spacefaring Terraria.  Many elements of the game are randomly generated. Most monsters are pre-made, but there are several variants with random body parts. Weapons are one of the most prominent random features; each possesses a different appearance and a special ability.  By far the most unique feature is the spacefaring. Starbound has you travelling around in your starship, discovering new and alien worlds on your quest to defeat the being which destroyed Earth.  Each planet and biome has exclusive loot, and occasionally you can find a settlement! The villagers can give you randomly generated quests, which you can complete for small rewards. Some may even wish to join you on your adventures! These new crewmembers become shipmates which can follow you around and give several passive buffs; some include the Soldier, Medic, Engineer, Tailor, and totally-not-useless Janitor.  Many unique premade weapons and other items can also be found on these planets, in addition to the random weapons; some are humorous, others creepy or downright strange.  Steam multiplayer and servers are also available for people who want to adventure together, or simply get together.  Modding is one of the game's finer aspects. Modding Starbound is nearly as easy as it gets; it simply requires a bit of knowledge of .json and .Lua code. There's even a mod folder directly in the game files! You can find many, many,  many  of these mods on the Workshop. Experiment a little and find what  you  like in your game!",

After it went dark, reputation for the company fell and understandably, people got angry, myself included. By now though, Chucklefish has returned and I must say, I am pleased with the results of their supercharged comeback. A proper story, pets, procedurally generated universe that never ends, an infinite amount of side quests to keep you going, a tenant system that can be customized as a theme-per-room to attract specific races to live in your apartment complexes, a crew, workshop integration, combat tweaks with combos and special abilities, upgrades to the matter manipulator and your self, the changes to the crafting system - there's just so many things I could list and so many more I haven't even found but I am looking forward to. The most important thing is the shift from TCP/IP connections to being able to work with your steam friends list for easy multiplayer setup with your friends. The choice between casual (little penalty on death, no hunger, etc) survival (hunger, etc) and hardcore (one life, survival features, etc.) is also pretty nice.  It's definitely worth the $15, and if you love things like Terrarria, I could not suggest this game any more. It's a must-have.   There are things I am not happy with, of course; the new item bar system is confusing at best sometimes, and I don't really like how the classic backgrounds given for each race have been discarded for a universal story. I enjoyed taking my Glitch from her Outcast background and envisioning her adventures from that kind of perspective. At this moment in time I cannot think of anything else I dislike about the game, though if it comes to it, I will return at a later time to refine and update issues.  For now, I love this game, and have spent a *lot* of hours in it, and recommend it highly.",

For those that don't care to follow instructions but want to be guided by a forceful hand to reach the end... you will probably be disappointed.  Story progression occurs through a series of missions and are accessible realatively early on.

And if you get bored with vanilla game, its mod support is fantastic - so there are already tens of great and surprisingly complex mods to spice it up.  Long version:  I was a little wary of trying Starbound at first, but afterwards I've sunk a few hundred hours into it. Now I can safely say that if you are looking for a game that is a mix of building, exploring and combat, this is definitely a game for you. It does not excel in either combat or exploring, but both of them are fun to do - and later on you can take all the newly-found shiny loot and add it to your growing house and colony. The main story, although not great in itself, is also a nice diversion between regular exploration and colony building - the quests themselves are quite simplistic and same-y, but the instances that you do between them are varied and fun (and each has a chance to drop a unique weapon too).  The game is of course not ideal. The main story, as I've said, is quite simplistic and could be better. Equipment and gear progression is sometimes 'too balanced' - although some gear is quite unique visually, it is often underpowered compared to the 'boring' vanilla randomly-generated weapons, so you often end up using those. And mechanics such as tenants can sometimes leave you wanting them to be just a little deeper.  The above however, despite how it may sound, is not such a big issue in my opinion. The game is simply fun to play and although some parts of it are a bit shallow, there are enough of them to provide hours of fun for an aspiring builder/explorer. And as mentioned before, the game is VERY moddable and the modding scene is very active. There are already mods that add a ton of new things, expand the game progression dramatically and smooth out its rough edges. They are also seamlessly integrated via Steam Workshop and very easy to install - so don't be afraid to try them out.  In summary: the game is not perfect, but provides a lot of fun for people who like building, exploring and some platformer combat.  PROS:  - very nice graphics, with smooth animation and a large variation of potential building blocks that you can use  - enjoyable instances, challenge rooms and microdungeons  - good variety of activities that you can take part in  - FANTASTIC mod support, with a ton of mods dramatically expanding the game  CONS:  - main story is a bit lacking  - game is too balanced at times, which makes some weapons and techs a bit boring   - some mechanics, although functional, could be more developed",

            "review_text": "Starbound is not like Terraria and that's a mistake. Starbound is a sandbox game with narrow paths and empty purpose. The game has no soul. It doesn't know what it wants to be and I think the developers definitely gave too much attention to their 'white knight' fans. You have to be interested only in the artistry of this game, I think, to enjoy it. I've owned it since the kickstarter and the first betas years ago. Here's a summary of what I have to say.  The progression is super short and mostly boring.  The combat is novel but always boils down to best damage rather than style, tactic or build/class.  Boss fights are lame and not a challenge. Monsters in general are rarely challenging (I personally never felt challenged).  The questing is absolutely terrible. It truly feels as though no thought or care was given to whether or not ANY of the quests would be fun. I personally only enjoyed the Glitch castle defense in the main quest.  You can complete all progression in the game from the starting screen galaxy viewer on your ship. Even though there is a gargantuan universe available for exploration.  There is close to nothing going on below the surface of any planet and most materials mined have no need or even a use.  The interesting aspects of Starbound were not included in the progression of the game. Such as colonies and most crafting. In fact I beat the last boss with gear I bought from merchants on the highest tier planets. I never crafted a single weapon or piece of armor. Only the EPP units I needed to survive. Of which I had the best version of in a little over an hour of play. I'm not a speed player either. I'm a completionist. I like to take my time and casually set goals rather than bulldoze the content but Starbound rarely rewarded my exploration.  One technically plays a protector of the universe and it never mattered. I never had to build a colony or save a world from alien invasion. Never had to hunt down space pirates or evacuate a system from a dying star. All I had to do was planet hop. Scaling the surface for a few minutes each time to find chests. Then mine a little. Upgrade. Rinse and repeat.  But, you can make a pretty hotel, prison or cabin next to a lava river.  I would say: Don't buy it.",

My friends and I love to get on and play. I play this game mostly on my family Steam and have clocked over 450 hours. It's one of the most fun games. I highly recommend listening to music, a podcast, talking with friends, or watching a show in the background for people who like to play games mindlessly for relaxation, but that is not the only way you can enjoy the game. I feel after the full release, we have been given all we were promised and more! The game is great and I cant wait to see how it turns out. See you at the gate my friends!  Id like to add that there are a few things that would make this game even better. Starting with the settings. Starbound has a LOT of partical effects, and for people with laptops, its hard to have the game running faster than 3 fps when blizzards and stuff occur. It would be nice to have:  1) mouse sensitivity options   2) Particle settings to make the game lag less  3) Some sort of entity settings to make large towns not lag as much.  4) A GUI size setting. The current only way to make it smaller is to play on a small screen or have the game window down to a tiny size",

So when I opened up Starbound again everything has changed, how? When I got in my ship was already jumping somewhere, somewhere random in the universe, I wouldn't mind it, but. All my bookmarks were gone, all my teleports where gone, everything was gone. It's like the game restarted from the begginning even though i had my items, upgraded ship, missions, crew...

            "review_text": "Not sure why I'm writing this since it'll probs just get lost but anyhow, here's my review of this game.   I originally purchased this game around it's initial 'Early Release' release over two years ago. The game back then seemed too vanilla. The concept was very intreguing. Being a huge fan of Terraria, the idea of that game on a much bigger scale really held my interest. To my disappointment, the game didn't have much to offer. Once you 'beat' the game, which only took a day or two of playing, there was just nothing to do. And by 'beat' i just mean aquire the best armor and weapons really. There wasn't really any story at the time.  Fast forward to now. 1.0 is released and the game has changed drastically. One day, a few weeks back, I decided to try this game out once more. It was all over the home page of Steam and it really made me want to give it one more chance, at least to the point where I felt like it was worth the buy. Well, I can honestly say that, after playing for another 20 hours or so and beating the main story, it isn't a bad game. The story progression is decent, the game mechanics are smooth, and it is overall an enjoyable experience. Before I explain any more in detail, I will list a few of my personal pros and cons.  Pro: -Fun with friend (Multiplayer) -Good sense of completion/accomplishment after completing main story quests -Plays well (Good weapon/tool mechanics) -Has a lot more potential  Cons: -Quite boring alone (In my own opinion) -Story is a bit too short -Story missions are a bit too repetitive -Final boss is the main one that doesn't feel very rewarding (also too easy and quick) -Has a lot more potential  The reason I put 'Has a lot more potential' on both is because it really is both good and bad. It's good that the developers have room to make the game better, but it's also not too good because at points, the game still doesn't feel fully complete. There also needs to be more variation in the main story. Every mission is just (spoiler warning possibly) scan (race) objects -&gt; teleport to (race) location -&gt; defeat boss. It just feels too wash-rinse-repeat. Anyhow, on a better note, the game is actually enjoyable with friends. Mining and building with others is fun, and upgrading your ship and EPP provides a fun feeling of progression. Exploring the various environments and fighting the different enemies is both exciting and annoying, but hey, I think those feelings combined make these type of games good. If it's never a little annoying, it's probably not challenging, and cake-walk games aren't generally as fun. The weapon/armor progressions/tiers were a bit confusing. It was a bit tricky to figure out when you really had the best things in the game, and the wiki wasnt much help. It seems to still be in the progress of being updated. Anyhow, let's wrap all this mess up into a conclusion.  Starbound is a fun game if you have another person to play with. If you are looking for a game that has a lot of replayability, I do not believe this is a game for you. It's fun to play through the main story once, maybe twice, but much more it just feels to overdone and boring. If you are okay with that, this game is a good buy. I was pleased with the newest update. If they add more to the story, I will consider playing again, but for now, once was enough. Like I said, there is definetly more that this game could be, the question is, will any more come of it?",

For the entire game: Go scan like 15 specific objects from this race, oh by the way they might not even be on the planets they say they will be on. So you gotta spend hours looking for the final objects. Then you get some 5-15 minute mission that isnt fun and alot of dialogue and boring fighting. The cycle continues for all the races. The most tedious story line I have ever played.   Now for the gameplay. Overall there isnt much to speak about. It's not bad. I'm not sure I would call it entertaining or satisfying all the time. But at the start of the game, the game play is boring compared the later in the game. The start of the game goes like this: swing starter sword, or some crap weapon you found. Chop a few trees. Fall off a cliff. Go into a mine, fight some bats and ♥♥♥♥. find a bunch of useless ♥♥♥♥, and maybe the stuff you are looking for, give up and dig to the core of the planet to find the stuff you need. Then you fix the ship. Then the tedious quest line starts. Now later in the game play: its the same as before but you have cool weapons and armor, and maybe a hover bike. It is not as tedious. A little bit more fun. Your crew follows you around and helps you. You are a proud captain. Your ship has become large. You should be proud. Look this game certainly isnt the best. But I am no way saying it's bad. If you enjoyed Terraria just think of this as Space terraria. I do have a few issues with Starbound though. Such as they removed random monster generation, in other words you see the same damn monsters on almost every planet. This was a sad change for me. Sadly this game does lack replayability.",

            "review_text": "Simultaneously endearing and addicting, Starbound is one game capable of providing innumerable hours of enjoyable gameplay. Whether you wish to explore strange new worlds and civilizations, or battle a space mobster penguin in a flying saucer, the adventure is there awaiting you.  By and large Starbound is a stressless, carefree, and charming sort of game. While some of the bosses in the game can be somewhat challenging, it is not the sort of game that invites much frustration. Others may comment that the controls can, in some instances, feel a little clunky; I wasn’t too pleased I could only use my weapons while standing still… but overall, I cannot complain, and I cannot say that minor nitpicks like that have ever bothered me. There have only been two areas in which I have experienced minor frustration.  Number one cause of minor frustration: some of the modes of the game, such as Survivor, cause you to lose pixels (currency) and drop all of your current items upon death… and if you drop your items in an out-of-the-way, hard-to-access location (like a cave on the far side of a planet), it can become rather irritating to attempt to regain your lost inventory (you might die SEVERAL MORE TIMES in the process, only worsening your situation). However, players can choose to use the Casual mode instead, in which no pixels or items are lost upon death in the game.  Number two cause of minor frustration: while Starbound provides a lot of in-game teaching to help you learn how to use various items and equipment, there were a number of instances in which I had to Google how to do something I thought would be intuitive – how to plant and grow crops, how to build blocks with the matter manipulator, how to eat food, how to craft certain items, etc. Maybe this is solely my problem, caused by obliviousness, and others find these actions more intuitive. However, for me, at the start of the game, I often found myself fiddling around, confused about how to proceed with what I thought should have been simple tasks. But – that said, that was only a minor frustration at the start of gameplay. I have come to realize that Starbound is a lot about exploring options and discovering things on your own – and with that mindset, learning how to do new actions in a casual exploratory-sense became a lot of fun, and I lost all such taskmastering concerns about how to do things.   And that really is what makes Starbound so enjoyable: exploration. Exploration of planets and planets and planets and planets. Exploration of desert biomes, frozen mountain biomes, jungle biomes, ocean biomes, even flesh biomes. Exploration of various alien species civilizations. Exploration of worlds with one-eyed cat ghost alien creatures, fire-breathing bird alien creatures, hopping carrot alien creatures. Exploration of how to cook rice or build rope or construct shields or upgrade your space vessel. I will admit I haven't gotten too far into the story, even having done about 36 hours of gameplay... but I don't mind. It's just too fun to explore. I'll casually mosey my way through the story eventually.  I suspect some people could get bored of the biomes available on Starbound alone, or of the quests, or of the music, or of the general overall “feel” of Starbound. The game carries with it a sort of simplicity. For me, though, and the other individuals I know who play Starbound… it is carefree and addicting.  Mods for this game are definitely worth checking out, as they provide new layers to Starbound, and many more different types of things to explore.   Starbound is a game I would recommend to many people. Again, it is charming. It is endearing. It has a smile-evoking, amusing, uplifting sort of atmosphere to it. It is a game I have already spent many hours playing, and plan to spend many, many more.",

You can mine in relative safety on the surface, or dig deep and discover caverns of rarer materials. You can then use those materials to craft better armor or higher grade work stations used to build and make better equipment.  You can find a multitude of weapons with various abilities inherent to them to suppliment their basic attacks, then use those weapons to combat creatures and npcs of the many races in themed dungeons.  You can harvest crops found growing in the different biomes and use them to prepare foods that grant buffs, and you can use seeds you find to build your own farm.  You can build your OWN settlements block by block and fill them with tenants that will reward you with money and gifts. If you fill their rooms with race-specific furniture you can even make your own themed settlement filled with a race or type of tenant of your choosing.  And you can choose between wandering from planet to planet, star to star, in search riches and adventure, or following the main questline and exterminating the great evil looming over the universe.

Seeing it grow has been a very enjoyable experience, but seeing what it has become has been both amazing and awful.  While there are some systems in place that I am very pleased with how they've evolved, there are others that still feel shallow or lackluster. Take the Combat for example, no matter what you do in the early game you will inevitably get damaged after almost every encounter with the indigenous alien life which forces you to pop salve after salve in between every encounter. Combine this with the hunger system and you are sure to die the first time you go underground for an extended expedition for Core Fragments.   Another big mistep in my opinion is the way they handled death post-alpha. It used to be you lost pixels(the in-game currency) at a flat pecent rate upon death, you would keep all of your inventory but be forced to respawn on the ship. Now when you die, you lose building materials, health items and ores AS WELL AS the pixel penalty from before.   Chuckle Fish, this isn't the Souls series. I'm here to explore, build and collect, not fight with the boring and broken combat system just to die time and time again to something ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like being conered by four monster that fell ontop of me after a sandvalanche caused them to pile up proximity hitting me every half second. If you wanted the combat to feel 'tactical' or 'stategic' as you've plainly put it before - only do the damage when they attack, not when they are touching you. That mechanic has always been dumb and I'm surprised it passed so many updates without a change.  All in all, this game is worth the buy. It is massive and overall an enjoyable experience. Although with how many years we've been beta testing this for them, you'd think it would be a masterpeice. . . oh well.",

I was with it from the extremely early stages, back when there was a temperature gauge and you used a beacon to lure a penguin boss to fight him. There was and extremely long period of nothing, where the game had some stuff to do, but the missions were long and dragged out, and most of the planets looked the same(except when you found one of the very rare special biomes on a planet, like eyeball or crystal). The missions lacked depth, were tedious, and were really just devices to get you to find some of the cooler(but still rare) biomes. It was like this for 2 or 3 years. Then, for a couple months, they dev team went silent when updating the stable build. It was a sad period for starbound. Then, suddenly and without warning, 1.0 hit. Starbound was out of early access. The several month quiet peroid made sense, because the devs LOADED the game with new stuff: 1. Steam multipplayer 2. Mod support via the Steam Workshop 3. Fixed mission system that had story and was ENGAGING 4. Completely reworked the lore, and added an intro mission that serves as a tutorial 5. More weapons 6. More biomes(just a few, they already have many) 7. More furniture, items, food, craftables, and lots of other stuff.  It was sad to see one of my favorite games(back in the day) go under the ice, but it has resurfaced in full glory, and that gives me hope again. Plus, if there is and issue with the game, someone can just fix it with a mod on the workshop :p (*cough cough optimization cough cough*)",

And for those of you who hate reading: Its good.   Its a fun game, with a lot of spirit put into it. For all those Terraria enthusiasts out there, there is technically more loot to use, more areas to visit, more creatures to fight, more things available to do. Theres simply more of pretty much everything.   And that is where I like to start my personal opinion on Starbound: Quantity does not equal Quality.  Starbound is good, and incorperates a lot of passion and ideas into a game that certainly will consume a lot of hours if you choose to dedicate them here. You can collect, farm, fight, and pretty much do everything you could in Terraria, plus additional features.   What the game doesn't have is not content, its quality. Combat in Terraria, movement, even building were polished to a mirror sheen. Less content was used to create a game that absolutely was worth hours of gameplay and enjoyment.   In its own regard, Starbound is an excellent independant game. Its finally been released, and it contains a real game, that is worth the asking price of $15.00. I personally have not felt like I experienced much of the game as of yet, and already I've put in about 18 hours, so from a PPH standpoint, this game is mathmatically worth your money.   To the developers, I have one thing to say: Terraria was many things, but at its heart it was a exploration game. You say Starbound is an exploration game, but I feel no reason to explore. There is no breathtaking vista, no hidden oasis, no secret place in your endless space. It is space, and while you have included much in it.... would you personally be excited to live in the universe you built?",

There is alot more to say about Starbound but I need to get back to playing it, so what are you waiting for go buy this game its amazing cant get bored with traveling to randomly generated plantes and finding cool new monsters I hope this review can persuade some people to buy it its a well worth buy and you wont regret it.",

Weapons After the combat update the great (did i mention randomly generated) weapons system got a great addition, special attacks were added to every weapon, bouncy bullets, teleportation, shields, just to name a few. overall the weapons in this game are just great  Quests Starbound is quite focused on making you do thing for people, which is actually a lot more fun than it sounds. Some people whilst playing terraria wall get a little bit lost and be like 'what am i supposed to do?!' this i promise you, will not happen in starbound due to the helpful (and slightly humerous) quest system. When you are tracking a quest you can still go and do whatever you want at any time so dont worry, saying yes to a quest is never bad.  Ships in starboud you get your own ship to customize, man and expand. At scertain times, when you meet the prequisites you can upgrade your ship allowing it to get bigger.

I thought that this was the one, I made a giant tower for storage and had allot of really goos stuff, I had the ability to go to ice planets then all of a sudden my friends computer craps out and his world deletes...

I mean, exploring a huge galaxy populated with all manner of alien races, ruins, and other stuff- how do you go wrong? Here's how: -Although starbound would be amazing as a fully open world game, they feel the need to shoehorn in a bunch of bullhonky quests that you have to complete to advance. Most of the quests are fetchquests, one quest was really, genuinely, actually walking twenty feet to the left to buy a chocolate bar and bringing it back. -Then they have missions, I think there are about 5 or so of these, but they take you to a short dungeon with a boss at the end. I think these are pretty fun, especially since they actually involve fighting, and not buying chocolate or catching bugs. Anyway, upon completing these missions, you get an implant that allows you to explore more hostile planets. -this shoehorned linearity gives the game much less replay value. Why make another character and go through all that busywork again?  Really, I think the story should work in the opposite way, as you advance in the open world, you should be able to come back and do this stuff if you want to/ for extra money and rewards. the quests shouldn't be imperitive for advancement.  Decent game, but poorly executed in some respects.  Edit: The game is easily modded, so you can easily make the game more entertaining if you want to. I usually don't play without mods anymore.",

It would also be REALLY cool if they pulled an FTL and made a larger ship selection. as of now, you can only get more ships through modding, and the modded ships don't even work anymore, or at least i just couldn't figure out how to get them working. But other than the lack of story variety, this is a very solid game! definitely recommend it. i only got this because of terraria, and i regret absolutely NOTHING.",

The world generation is unique, from anywhere to normal pine trees, to tall floral flower-trees, to pink trees with fluffy leaves, and dirts/grass of all sorts of colors, the vegetation is brought spot-on, with added in plants from real life or ones the devs decided to make up. Along with that, there are many randomized structures with enemies and loot. You start out by gathering a few materials and stuff, before managing to get your ship up and running to go to different planets for things- plants, minerals, items, etc. However, I'm not going to explain everything after that- you can figure that by yourself  Randomization- Planets with many biomes/sub-biomes, with different structures and loot that you can get per planet. You may be surprised or not so surprised at what you see. Guns and swords(non-crafted ones) with various stats, if you get enough you might find one that fits your playstyle, or one that has a really funny name. Creatures that include some squid-Cthulu monster spit blood that explodes at you, or some boxer creature with no eyes and a giant mouth that has the power of levitation. Building- The amount of materials you can find over the course of adventuring allows you to make so many different houses, including rainbow houses with unicorn statues, Japanese-style housing, or just a basic wood house with a giant library. It's yours to create, after enough adventuring. Music- I know, this is an opinion, but I have NEVER seen an as-great orchestral soundtrack able to convey emotions of all kinds, encouraging for the building of amazing mansions or running across the grass, ready to explore new things. It rivals legendary composers like Beethoven or Bach. Customizability- It's possible to customize your character in many ways, whether its their outfit, skin color, etc, the beginning character creator is, no-doubt, above-average in my eyes, where it is just enough to know this is MY character, made by ME! Then, you build your own building, etc etc, with the amazing music playing, and overall you feel like you're having a great time. As the game progresses, you grab more gear that is cool, and you end up leaving happy.    Dark Side- Little story, the quests are mere fetch-quests or dungeon runs that seem to have little point besides getting better gear and unlocking new planets. People who don't enjoy the game just rush past it, hardly experiencing the good gameplay left in the void.    Overall, Starbound is a great sandbox game with excellent music, good customizability, well-randomized worlds, creatures, etc and some of the best building possible to any 2d game. However, there is little story, and people seem to rush through the game rather than enjoy it properly.",

First purchased around 2014 would play once in a while during a larger release generally with friend(s). Wasn't quite sure when the game first came out but eventually got it. There have been many changes between then and release, some have been good and others uncertain.  Now that the full release has finally happened, what are the main changes? -Main story line. Something for those that need a goal. Also includes tentacles, who doesn't like tentacles? -Farming. Mainly Flora. Fauna are mainly to get rare crafting ingrediants. -Shipmates. Get NPC's in singleplayer or even bigger pizza parties in multiplayer. -Pokemon. You can capture and battle with the critters. -Quests. Mini quests from NPC's give more things to do. -Explore. Biome updates, new loot, new dungeons, strip planets bare, etc. -Fishing! An update added quite the interesting little fishing game. -Collect. Do you like collecting stuff? Between fossils, monster statues, food, and fish there are lots of things to mark off your checklist. Or ignore it all!  As mentioned above regarding changes, an example is reigning in the damage numbers. Was going on an adventure and visited an end game tier solar system after just starting. Was able to slowly make my way around an asteroid field picking up good resources while avoiding monsters and barely suriving the cold when I stumbled upon an abandoned storage facility of some sort. First course of action is to check the room for loot then swipe all the furniture and decorative blocks then proceed to the next room. Standard procedure. In the last room a sniper rifle with an absurd amount of damage was found and it was amazing.. of course I'd sometimes not use it in order to have a challenge but it was looted fair and square.  We can still skip ahead in the tiers a bit and ultimately this is a sandbox style game so there is no wrong way to play. Unfortunately that storage base, temperature, and a few other things were removed. Mods exist to bring many of these back and Chucklefish has been updating the game post-release so they could be refined and re-added.  Plus there are large changing mods such as Frackin Universe bringing significant changes and if you want crazy weapons back there are other mods for the job.. or make your own! Oh and it's DRM free so you can't always rely on the time played value.  This makes Starbound a great purchase even at full price.",

Loot that is randomly generated based on the level of the planet your on not you're character or the items you already have. 3.) No character leveling. You have gear and equipment that is upgraded. You as a human don't level up. 4.) The item discovering and crafting in this game is a lot harder to follow then terraria but still shows what is needed at all times. 5.) Bosses, A Story, An Experience. This is a game with a story to tell and how fast you play and explore controls the speed of progress. It's your story play it at your speed.   I loved Terraria I still play it and Stardew Valley both. This is another game I play Along side both those games rather than discarding it off as another Terraria.",

However, there are still many performance issues and progress halting bugs, particularly if you paln to play with loved ones. Many of these can be fixed by admin commands or with workarounds, but as is, the release product feels a little unfinshed.  If you're willing to bite in now, you might have a few unpleasent suprises. If you can dodge the bugs and don't mind the occasional detour to get back to a functioning program, you may even enjoy yourself.",

Even worse - they changed their goals, tweaked them and so on. The development seemed extremely unfocused and so it went nowhere.   In the mean time Terraria got patches over patches and got better then Starbound at pretty much anything. Starbound was very ambitious, but never reached any of its goals. It took years and years between meaningful updates and even through those the game always just got something added which changed the game, but it didn't enrich the game.  The combat is very ambitious, but it never quite worked. The idea with various planets with various perils and dangers and things to discover is a great idea, but ultimately it's different colours for the very same biotopes over and over.  I gave this game a go several times, and it never was much fun. It disappointed in all things which were meant to elevate it over other games of the genre and what was there for basics other games did better. I don't suggest buying this.",

Even on higher difficulties, you just take more damage. Main story can be beaten in a few hours without having to ever upgrade any crafting tables, if you know what youre doing.  -Unsatisfying Combat  -Feels far too easy in general actually.

The game has really good pixel-art graphics and music and characters, and lots of places to explore.

You should buy early access games only if you're satisfied what the game already has. Does it have endgame content? Not a whole lot, build a base, farm, do colony quests, grind for those 1 in a thousand figurines. That's pretty much there is to it and even the upcoming 'ancient vaults' update won't be enough to satisfy your needs for endgame content.

You once again realise you don't care. The Questionable friends stab you with needles, in turn giving you super human powers. You realise they are just giving you drugs. You realise they suck at fighting. The Questionable friends makes your ship slightly better. You thank them, but realise you don't care. You realise you just thanked AI. You realise that AI sucks at everything You realise that your crew sucks too. You get rid of your crew. You hire peguins to fight for you. They suck too. You want to get rid of them. You realise you spent 5 diamonds to make them be here. Greedy lil' $*%#@. You leave your ship to find a hylotol village. You realise they suck at fighting too. You kill everyone and steal everything.

The only real similarity I would point out is that they are both 2D-Sidescrolling Sandbox games. The genre is the same, but the execution is very different.   Starbound is more of an RPG style, where there is an actual story and quests to play through, as opposed to Terraria which, if I remember right, just has the bosses to kill, hard mode, and the Angler's Fishing quests.   In Starbound, you choose what race you want to be, start the game, learn the backstory, and are thrown into your ship, which is pretty destroyed and out of fuel. Go do stuff, find orange shards which unlock an outpost, and continue your story from there with a little bit of guidance.  I won't spoil anything past that, but it's definitely worth a play. Solid 8/10 for me, only being marked down because the story is a little short if you know what you're doing. For me, this causes replayability issues. I also know that it has workshop support, so there are lots of mods to keep people playing after the story is well over. If I'm not mistaken, Chucklefish is still adding to the game as well, so you have that to look forward to.",

It would be easier if they didn't take so long releasing the game, it's not like I'm bitter or anything.  Comparisons to Terraria are inevitable so let's get that out of the way. The planets are inevitably much more shallow than a Terraria world, there's maybe two interesting things per planet but there's a whole galaxy of them. Starbound offers space hopping from planet to planet and spending a little time on each to grab what's useful. If you prefer to get attached to your environment you may be left wanting, you can save planets and build your home base on one, but any individual planet will not offer a depth of exploration.  Progression is mostly done through plot missions, typically you need an item to survive on more challenging planets and something nasty needs to be killed to obtain this item. There's also the usual mine new ore to build better tools to mine new ore system.  Combat is fairly decent: melee is the typical hit things with large weapons affair but I found the guns to have a satisfying feel to them.  I would recommend this game but I also had a lot of context going into Starbound so you should probably play a whole bunch of Minecraft and Terraria first, and then because you're bored of mining games have some friends do all the heavy lifting in the Starbound progression system while you make a monkey house.",

It's cozy and familiar with it's core crafting, combat, and exploration elements, yet offers so much more once the player unlocks interplanetary travel. Rather than having every single biome contained to one large world, Starbound allows you to skip between and explore various planets in thousands of systems. There's many, many different environments and civilizations that you can find; arid desert plains with gnomes living under the surface, eyeball tree forests settled by knights, swampy jungles filled with planty cannibals... even expansive oceans where you've got to dive deep to find any intelligent life at all. It's a vast and varied universe that Starbound offers, with enough variance in weapons, armor, and gadgets to keep most anyone happy on their adventures.  When it's time to make a home, the player's given a sizable variety of different materials and styles to choose from-- granted they've collected them on their travels. For those who prefer building to adventuring, the only disappointment I've found was being unable to add smooth diagonal slopes. Beyond that, the choices offered were phenomenal. You can keep tenants that will periodically give you gifts as rent, or offer quests that may allow you to employ them to your ship's crew. You can raise adorable variations of fluffalo, set up a farm of alien veggies, structure crafting labs, build a teleportation network, and construct whatever buildings and homes you might imagine. If living on a planet's surface isn't even to your tastes, the player's ship is expandable and can be fully renevated within.  Starbound suits a myriad of fancies if exploration and crafting games are what you enjoy. It offers a universe full of interesting discoveries, exciting adventures, cozy homes, cute characters, and an ever-charming atmosphere.",
