            "review_text": "INCOMING REVIEWER!  Ah yes, the Incoming series. Awful shame it had to die off so long ago. The original Incoming was one of the first PC games I ever played, utilizing a Real3D StarFighter graphics card, and a whopping 400MB of RAM! I had fond memories about this game; how graphically impresive it was for the late 90's. But two questions remain; Does the Incoming bundle hold up today, and is it worth buying? The short answer for these questions is Yes and No, so please allow me to explain.  It's safe to say that Incoming and Incoming Forces do not hold up by their own selves today. With our PC's always upgrading with maximum stats, combined with how old these games are, it should come to no surprise that the games are heavily outdated, and poorly optimized. In the original Incoming, I found many of the models to be incorrectly rendered, enabling you to see through them. I am also aware that Incoming cannot be correctly played on Windows 8.1 and 10 machines, so unless you have Windows 7 at latest, you may want to pass this game; you're not missing much.  On the other hand, Incoming Forces is a much more optimized piece of software, but is not really a 'great' game per-se. In retrospect, the plot is silly, and for a 2002 game, I've seen much better-looking games. Gameplay is also a bit lackluster, so I would recommend the consumer to purchase the product mainly for the original Incoming; Incoming Forces feels like an unnecessary pack-in, so I'd consider it as a form of bonus game.   Now, is this product worth buying? For me, it was a simple 'yes,' because I obtained it during a sale. I had fond memories of this game, and I wanted to return to see what I was missing all these years. As for the average consumer, I would recommend this game only if they are a hardcore fan of vehicular combat, combined with space-like arcade railshooting. If you are into that 'futuristic' techno vibe, look no further than the original Incoming's soundtrack. While small, the songs are rather catchy, and the game is definitely worth playing to at least hear these songs.  All in all, Incoming and Incoming Forces isnt too bad of a product to invest in. I feel that the price may be a bit much for these rather obscure titles, but hey, you're getting a dual-pack that was originally valued along the lines of $40 dollars in the day. It's ultimately your choice whether or not you want these games.  Ratings:  Incoming: 7/10  Incoming Forces: 5/10",
