Before things got stupid...before we got Elysium exo-suits....before we had smart dogs...before we had Zombies....before this franchinse became synomous with 'Adding another number/title to it'...we had this.  Still mindless run and gun and still incredibly overdramatic. The spirit of Michael Bay is alive and well within this franchise even at this early stage.   However, the first foray out of World War II for the series was a refreshing breath of air at the time and the original still holds up very well.  All Ghillied Up is still one of the greatest levels in ALL of Call of Duty.",

            "review_text": "My Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare Review.  Ok, so I have played A LOT of this game so i feel that i'm justified in saying  that this game is FANTASTIC. In this review i will go through the pros and cons  of purchasing this game. I am trying to come from a perspective of someone who  has played this game since 2008, I have purchased this game 4 times, for Xbox  360, PS3, Retail Box and Steam. Over the 4 versions of the game I would say that  I have played a good 1000 hours. Yet I keep coming back for some reason. Cod4 is  one of the games that I play each and every day. I mostly play Promod, but I dip  into Non-modded every now and then.  Pros: Mod Support, many, many mods for this game. There is a whole separate game of  just mods. To name a few there is Prop Hunt, Promod, One in the chamber and a  multitude of others. Smooth uninterrupted game play, I wish more games had this these days. From the ground up this game was made to be as smooth as possible.  Developer Console, this is a biggy in my books. Not enough games these days have this. This is the command line that you can use to edit any settings that you would like, you can load maps, change  Sensitivity aswell as other settings such as FOV and maxfps. With commands like cg_fov 80 and  com_maxfps 250.  Cons: There are very few cons for this game. Some of the biggest and most prevalent are  the aim botters and silent aim users. If anything this is what will send you over  the edge. Another thing is that most of the servers are unpopulated. Don’t get me wrong,  there is still a huge player base in CoD4. Its just that I wish there were more.  Thank you for reading this review and I hope that it will influence your purchase  in a good way. Cheers, Virconium",

It isn't like the others The community is mature Snipers actually tend to not 'quickscope' or 'noscope' People actually play the game instead of attempting trickshots There still is a big multiplayer community packed with mods, custom gamemodes like Deathrun, and etc. Not like Ghosts and all the futuristic ♥♥♥♥, just Modern Warfare. The campaign has simplistic but good gameplay, mainly it is just running and shooting but it has a great story with strong characters. The multiplayer gamemodes are fun. Most servers are dedicated  Warning though, Punkbuster's contract with Activision ended, so you may have minor multiplayer problems. Most can be easily patched.  9/10 A great game.",

It's a Good gen first-person shooter developed by the company Infinity Ward and published by Activision Company. I really like this game because the story beginssomewhere in the near future where there is a civil war involving countries US, UK, and Russia against Russian ultranationalists and rebels in a small country in Middle East.      The story was very successful and also the characters and action!      Levels are:      Prologue      F.N.G.     Crew Expendable     The Coup       Act I      Blackout      Charlie Do not Surf     The Bog     Hunted      Death From Above     War Pig     Shock and Awe      Aftermath      Act II      Safehouse     All Ghillied Up     One Shot, One Kill     Heat     The Sins of the Father      Act III      Ultimatum     All In     No Fighting In The War Room     Game Over      Epilogue      Mile High Club - Bonus mission that takes place on a plane hijacked by terrorists.

Are available at Multiplayer several ways like as: Free-for-all | Team deathmatch | Search &amp; Destroy | Domination | Headquarters |     Also you can custom your Class. The multiplayer it's good, have nice maps and it's fun to play with your friends :D      My rating about Call of Duty® 4: Modern Warfare® |      • Story: 9/10     • Graphics: 8.50/10     • Sound: 8/10      I Recommend this Call of Duty because it's a good game of series Modern Warfare :) The Story it's nice and full of action.

This was when companies were trying to make the most out of the new technology they were given. Call of Duty still had that goosebump inducing storyline, it was practically the only campaign worth replaying. This game in particular gives you a single player experience that you will remember forever. If you haven't played it, stop reading and go play it NOW, you're no good to humanity alive.  The excitment didn't just stop at the single player of course. You can NEVER leave out the multiplayer that set the standard for first person shooters for years to come. Though the multiplayer has been long outvalued by the current Call of Duty games, this is where it started. For those of you just joining the franchise, it's comments like 'this game sucks', 'the graphics are terrible', 'mechanics are clunky' that make you look like a fool. For those of us that have been playing Call of Duty from the very start, this game was the best on the market for us. It's insulting when people like you come around and try to criticize it. You can't and won't understand how great of a game this was for us.  If you play the single player, this game holds it's value at 20 dollars. Don't expect much from multiplayer these days though.

            "review_text": "War rages on in the fourth edition of Activision's acclaimed war game. For the first time in the series, Call of Duty moves away from WWII to the modern battlefield. Armed with an arsenal of advanced and powerful modern day firepower, players are transported to treacherous hotspots around the globe to take on a rogue enemy group threatening the world. As both a U.S Marine and British S.A.S. soldier fighting through an unfolding story full of twists and turns, players use sophisticated technology, superior firepower and coordinated land and air strikes on a battlefield where speed, accuracy and communication are essential to victory. The epic title also delivers an added depth of multiplayer action providing online fans an all-new community of persistence, addictive and customizable gameplay.  Of course, if you're looking for longevity, that's where the multiplayer comes in. Up to 18 players can get online and get into a match on one of 16 different maps. Many of the levels are taken from portions of the single-player and they offer a healthy mix of wide-open, sniper-friendly areas and tight, almost cramped spaces where grenades and shotguns are the order of the day. There are six game modes to choose from. The old standby is team deathmatch, though you can also play in a free-for-all deathmatch, which isn't as much fun as the team modes. The other modes are more objective-oriented, and a couple of those have you lugging bombs across the map to blow up enemy equipment, or preventing the enemy from blowing up your base. Others have you capturing control points. Lastly, you can change up the game rules a bit with a hardcore setting that makes weapons more realistically damaging or an old-school mode that puts weapons on the ground as pickups and generally moves away from the simulation side of things.",

I did, however, play through Modern Warfare 1 and 2 as they went on sale, and I was thoroughly impressed. As you can expect just by looking at the store page, the game is visually stunning. What you don't see, however, is the storylines (plural) that you follow as Army Rangers and Spec Ops fight to ensure America's continued global dominance amidst emerging threats (MW 1) and to ensure America's survival as all hell breaks loose (MW 2). While the single player game is challenging (frustratingly so on some parts), the story line only gives you about 5 - 6 hours of gameplay and doesn't offer any outside-of-story single player enjoyability as you would see in Modern Warfare 2.

The easiest difficulty is even hard at some parts where death is possible if 1 wrong move is made. I have played through every difficulty and The top difficulty is nothing short from gritty realism. 2 shot deaths. Wind changes, less speed, more enemies. OVerall this game I give my thumbs up.",

            "review_text": "Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare is a first-person shooter action video game developed by Infinity Ward and published by Activision 2007 .  Groups of Marines and British SAS must fight an ultranationalist group that plans a third world war . The player plays as various characters in the story. Yet the narrative is linear and the game looking to get a cinematic effect .  COD 4 Modern Warfare renewed the graphics engine of the previous games in the series in a big way. It had great success and to some extent became the spiritual successor of Counter Strike . It had two sequels that continue the story to its end in Modern Warfare 3. The game has a very mature multiplayer component where the player can call air attacks and reconnaissance vehicles.  Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare really innovated in the genre. It took the war to the modern era , a battle without pause and film like scenes. Hundreds of shots , stealth, sniper attacks , and a variety of weapons immerse us in this world war. In fact , although the following Call of Duty are much more up to date, they seem an extension of this brilliant game . The feeling of being in the ghost town near Pipriat Chernobyl is shocking , COD MW4 was technologically wonderful in 2007.  The game sold over 13 million copies in two years and obtained a score of 94 out of 100 on sites like Metacritic or GameRankings .  The game was released for Windows PC , PS3 and XBOX 360. The windows version required DirectX 9.0c API . While it requires a graphics card, the game has very low requirements for the graphic quality it has.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ESPAÑOL ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- El Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare es un videojuego de acción en primera persona desarrollado por Infinity Ward en 2007 y distribuido por Activision.  Grupos de Marines y SAS britanicos deben combatir a un grupo ultranacionalista que planea una tercera guerra mundial. El jugador participa como varios personajes en la historia. Aún así la narrativa es muy lineal y el juego busca conseguir un efecto cinemático.  El COD Modern Warfare renovó en gran forma el motor gráfico de los anteriores juegos de la serie. Tuvo grán éxito y en alguna medida se convirtió en el sucesor espiritual del Counter Strike. Tuvo dos secuelas que continúan con la historia hasta su fin en el Modern Warfare 3. El juego tiene un componente multijugador muy desarrollado donde el jugador puede llamar a vehículos aéreos de ataque y reconocimiento.   El Call of Duty Modern Warfare realmente innovó en el género. Nos llevó por primera vez a la guerra moderna, con un combate sin pausa y escenas 'de película' soprendentes. Centenares de disparos, sigilo, ataques Sniper, y una gran variedad de armas nos sumergen en este mundo en guerra. De hecho, si bien los siguientes Call of Duty son mucho mas modernos, parecen una extensión de este brillante juego. La sensación de estar en la ciudad fantasma de Pipriat cerca de Chernobil es impactante, tecnológicamente el COD MW4 fue una maravilla del 2007.  El juego vendió mas de 13 millones de copias en dos años y obtuvo un puntaje de 94 sobre 100 en sitios de críticos como Metacritic o GameRankings.  El juego se lanzó para PC bajo Windows, PS3 y XBOX 360. La versión de windows requería la API DirectX 9.0c. Si bien requería una tarjeta gráfica medianamente buena, es un juego que posee requerimientos bastante bajos para la calidad que tiene.",

Instead of throwing enemies at you that have more skill and use better weapons, the game just throws what seems like the entire Russian Army at you. Multiplayer is still going strong, as when I checked, there were over 2,000 servers online, and the majority of them had players in them. Though, alot of them are modded (Hackers, Prop Hunt, other custom game modes). Other than that, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a pretty solid game, even after 7 years, the game has stood the test of time as there is still a thriving community making fun mods and custom maps for the game.

Modern Warfare 2 is much better in legnth and scale but that is because they had more money to make after the sucess of this one and World at War.

The gameplay is varied and kept my attention. The difficulty was a little steep and sometimes a death would feel cheap, but not too often. Overall, it's mindless, Michael Bay-style fun...what else can I expect?  Recommended for fans of: Explosions, shooty-shoot bang-bang, and tactical badassness.",

Multiplayer is a patiencerape if you have no idea how to play shooters like these, I am a Battlefield man myself and this insanely quick style of gameplay was so hard to surivive in.

Other 'old' CoD games have very low player counts &amp; this one is older than all those, so I figured it would have the lowest... Man was I wrong!  After I filtered out all full servers &amp; all empty servers, I STILL got almost 4,000 servers pop up that all had players in it!!!!! (yes you read that right... 4,000 Servers!) This is probably THE most played CoD on Steam!  At the time that I'm writing this, I have played several hours &amp; I have yet to run into any hackers, or people running mods or anything like that. Or if I have, it went unnoticed. There are however LOTS of modded servers. Mods like Star Wars &amp; Freeze Tag. Just fun make shift game modes that LOTS of people enjoy, however, finding just a normal TDM game is very easy to do.  The ONLY negative feedback I will give this game is the massive player counts all these servers are running. The typical player count you will see is 50, but I have seen servers running 200 &amp; they were FULL!!!!!!!!!! Now you may be thinking, OH HOW AWESOME! I bet it's just non stop action! Well you'd be right in thinking that. Thing is, these maps were designed with like 18 or 24 players MAX in mind... When you get on some of these smaller maps with 50 players, it just turns into a frag fest &amp; it's not very fun. HOWEVER... There are plenty of servers that have a 50 player cap, but only ever see like 20 or so players. Got to keep in mind, there's like 4,000+ servers, so they're not ALL going to fill up.  All in all, I give this game as of today, May, 25th 2014, a 10 out of 10!!!! I would recommend this game to anyone who is getting into PC gaming, people who are looking to play it again for a bit of nostalgia, or just someone looking to complete their CoD collection! Yeah $20 seems a bit steep for a game this old, but trust me... It's WELL worth it given how active it still is &amp; I don't see it dying off ANY TIME soon!",

The *Spoilers* scene of the nuke going off was really, really figgin cool when I first saw it.   Mulitplayer was groundbreaking. Killstreaks were invented here, and they were not only enjoyable, but didn't ruin the fun for everyone else. Guns felt so solid, and were mostly well balanced. Attachments really helped with this as well, ranging from a red dot, to a silencer, or a grenade launcher. Perks was another crucal innovation for this mode, as it helped define your style of play. All of these (back then) new unique elements helps create a real choice of freedom.  You get the map pack for free, because PC I guess.   Overall, a real solid FPS.

            "review_text": "Going to warn you right off the bat - I'm going to rant. I'm frustrated about the current condition of a game that I used to love, and even more frustrated that nothing will ever be done about it. TL;DR if you wish, I know this is a bit long, but I could have written more.  The thing about games like these, more often that not, is that it's the people playing that make the game great, not the game itself. I could say the same about Halo 2 or 3, or Garry's Mod, or Battlefield, or any decent MMO, or what have you. Seeing as I recently built a gaming PC, and in observation of the console hackfest, I bought the PC version of this once-great shooter to try and rekindle the feeling of brotherhood and teamwork I got playing with friends years ago.   Unfortunately, due to its age and some other factors, CoD4 has lost this glimmer.   As far as the game itself, it's the last good Call of Duty, honestly. I faithfully played the Xbox 360 version until around the time MW3 came out, by then it became so infested with hackers that it became difficult to play a legitimate game. The PC version's dedicated servers have, for the most part, kept hackers at bay, but since Punkbuster is a pain to deal with, I don't feel like installing it, and thus have to play on unprotected servers. (I have Windows 8.1, and I'm honestly surprised CoD4 runs as well as it does on my system. The last time I tried installing Punkbuster for CoD4, it gave me a whole bunch of random errors that I didn't feel like dealing with.)  One thing I liked about Call of Duty in the past is that it was relatively simple, CoD4 being no exception. WaW and even leading up to Black Ops things were still pretty simple. In MW2 I used to be able to tell, just by its firing sound, what weapon was used to kill someone, and relatively how far away. Now, in Ghosts, there's a whole bunch of stuff that I'm not willing to put in the effort to comprehend. I can't even imagine what Advanced Warfare is going to be like.   Call of Duty as a whole has become a pit of despair. ...There seems to be a thing about golden guns that really seems to get at people, and the effect it's had on the industry is not good. A lot of free FPSs that I play to kill time feature golden guns, but can only be bought with its respective premium currency - I can only deduce that this is due to the popularity of golden guns in the Call of Duty series, and they have been implemented as an attempt to make more profit. But, sorry, I'm going off on a tangent. I should be writing about CoD4.  Back in the day, you used to be able to grab a few friends, party up on Xbox Live, and play a good game of Search with good people. It was great. The feeling of brotherhood I got during those days was only matched by Halo 3. Now, I can't find a legitimate game. I was playing TDM today, with 40 players on Killhouse.  40 PLAYERS ON KILLHOUSE!!   That's TOO MANY PEOPLE. Now, maybe this is because I can't use Punkbuster, but I can't find a server with a good population that has less than a 30-player cap. 30 is too many! The maps are too small and the game is too fast-paced for that kind of a cap. 30 players is more of a low-population Battlefield server, which has the size of maps needed to support that.  And another thing - the darned auto-balance is horrible. Way to separate me from my friends while we're playing, server...I think that feature is stock, but it's still bad. This never happened on console, and we never had any issues with balance.  Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare has a very special place in my heart. It's painful to see it in this state - not just the PC version, but across all platforms.  I *want* to recommend it. But I can't. It's not worth $20 for a completely ruined game. I'm sorry.",
