            "review_text": "After playing previous games in the series, and finishing all the Heroes games but still wanting a fix of this sort of game, I ended up getting this on a bundle sale.  Started disappointing due to the clunky dialog and lacklustre gameplay, but I continued on if only to keep me visually stimulated whilst listening to audiobooks (the background musics alright, but not for over 50 hours of play). Midway the bugs started kicking in, including (but not limited to) units stacking inside each other, inventory screens and city screens remaining visible on the overworld, level ups not registering... but usually restarting the game would fix these and I figured I'd got halfway through so may as well finish. Then I reached the elf campaign. I pride myself on not resorting to easy modes as a general rule, but this game makes it nigh-on impossible to get past the first couple of enemies on any higher difficulty. After that point I was disappointed to find I couldn't raise the difficulty, meaning the rest of the game I was auto-battling every fight including bosses with little to no casualties. The only input I had as a player was clicking from fight to fight, following a relatively linear path until completing the map. But still, near the end of the game... I may as well see how the (bland and generic) story plays out. Final map. I'm tired of this game now and just want it to be finished. I level up my party to their highest ranks but then I ignore all treasure in favour of getting to the end. I reach the final gate, get a cutscene preparing for the final boss, and...? That's it. A script error causes a new objective to come up to destroy the city you just destroyed. Some say they fixed it by downloading a revised script, but no luck for me. 161 hours of gameplay (half of which was actual playing as I'm afk a lot), only to reach a brick wall at the very end. Nevertheless I'll be playing the expansion, as I paid for it as part of the bundle, but seriously- don't bother starting the same journey as me.",

            "review_text": "A great game with turn based, isometric map movement set in a medieval fantastic, dark gothic world. I like the improvements over Disciples II such as having a bigger party, having skills for your heroes, attributes, levels and even a paperdoll to equip items. The art direction or style remains the same as in Disciples II; It's gothic medieval fantastic and epic. The map, the units and the battles are all in 3d. In the single player campaign (only thing I've played), there are about 24 maps (I might be wrong) divided in Legions (Chaos), Humans and Elves. So about 8 maps for each race and each map can take more than an hour to finish. You can hire multiple heroes and transfer units between your heroes (as well as items) at will once both heroes are next to each other. There are permanent stat and skills boosters available to purchase. You can hire mercenaries, capture towns, build your capital, reinforce your 'nodes'. The battles are now played on a bigger board than in Disciples II. Each of your unit can move around the map and some spots you can move to have random bonuses specific to a unit's class (ranged, melee, magic).  Bad sides: I don't know why they removed the 'wait' action. Sometimes, my hero would be surrounded at my first turn (by a rock in front of him and 2 units on each side plus a full rank behind). Since my hero has the highest initiative, he acts first and thus cannot just 'wait' but ends up defending, which messes up everything regarding the deployment. The battles can be a bit long and repetitive, even with randomized terrain but I should check the options to skip animations at least.  Overall a must-try for Disciples fans and well worth trying for newcomers in search of deep turn based strategy and tactics with stunning artistic presentation.",

            "review_text": "I like the game, I thought that I might like it but it has exceeded my expectations because the bad reviews really had me debating about if it was worth a try.. I bought if for $3.00 on sale and I have 11 hours in already when I'm writing this. I'm sure that I'll put many more hours into it as I try to finish the 3 campaigns and I already feel that I got my moneys worth from it.There are so many negative reviews that I felt that I had to give my opinion on this one. It's not the best of it's type but it's far from the worst. If you typically like games like this then I suggest that you give it a try and see for yourself, grab it in the next big sale or just try it at regular price and refund it if you don't like it.. I like it well enough that I added all of the other Disciple versions to my wishlist and I plan to grab them all during sales.",

Since I was very new to this series, I thought this was a turn based strategy game with a campaign and such. So I started as the human general.  Completed the first leg of the campaign after searching the map and finding everything I could find, and figured I could finish upgrading my city in the next chapter. I was wrong.  I'm not a fan of having to basically start from scratch at the beginning of each chapter. It feels too much like an RTS (like StarCraft), I did not see an RTS tag or any mention of such elements. Figured I'd progress through the campaign, upgrading cities and units while fighting turn based battles.  I may have givin up a little too early, I don't know. It was a pretty crushing blow to see that my effort in finding loot and upgrading things was basically for nothing.",

            "review_text": "Disciples Sacred Lands and Disciples II .. are some of the best turned based strategy games out there to date and they are .. old.. almost as old as Tactics Ogre, FF tactics, or Kingdom Under Fire. Not a lot of game companies can completly screw themselves out of a winning formula.. but they did it.. boy did they do it. If you ever played Koudelka another turned based game also made in 1999. You will see how they flip flopped the entirety of the battle machanic to something less desirable than the 2 original games from 99 and 02. I personally considered the static grittiness and archaic battle system far greater than most others.   And where's my flags? The genius of simplicity in the originals far outweighed the more advanced or presentable offerings than most current turn based games at that time. However the Hex design is done quite well. Even better than most Heroes games. What really irks me is the way the combatants hit eachother.. and theres no blood and guts.. like it was in the old game. When the enemies struck eachother.. it almost felt as if you were being struck or shot or blasted.. this just has a very poor way of illustrating a strike to an enemies body compared to the old game.  A Town a TOWN my kingdom FOR A TOWN .. where is it? .. i could barely stomache 15 minutes before quitting on the second mission. I'll just hold it down and play through it.. but wheres my towns?.. I guess that's the price we pay for such stunning graphics.. oh well.. I really hope this game series.. GOES BACK .. to the original design that won them praises from even the most hardcore turned based strategies.. guess I'll just go play Xcom.. or Massive Chalice.. or maybe even reload that old campaign from Disciples 1 or 2.",

I will not do this but it really pisses me off when autors didnt fixed this bug already cause the game is a few years old. But altogeter the game was fun.",
