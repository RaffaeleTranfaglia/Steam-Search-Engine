This game dynamics and stratagies have changed a bit between every update and as a fellow devloper its quite awesome to beable to exspirence this on the other end.  Theirs no FAQ or real good unit guide, i have scribbled down a bunch of notes to what unit i was for what i am doing. I have a fleet layout for what type of work i am doing Missles for attaching large slow ships and terrroties, beams for getting rid of pirates, Shreaders and plasma guns somewhere inbtween.",

Gameplay is addictive as hell, and i like that it takes awhile to get strong. You dont just go from level 1 to having multiple maxed out cities in an hour or two, the game is looong. Fantastic release, I love it.",

            "review_text": "Basically an RTS based in a solar system where you control a flagship, and manage a city over a section of space. You build your city, you build your fleet, and try to win using 1 of 3 generic 4X victory conditions.   Depth level is standard in what you would find in a game for this price, and while you are given options to play the game 'peacefully', they are limited and impractical. Meanwhile, the militaristic approach is also limited, since you can only destroy a limited amount of assets of another city before you're forced to accept their surrender or sour your relations with the rest of the AI. It's not all bad though, as it works in your favor too if you get gangbanged.   That aside, you should be able to squeeze dozens of time-killing hours out of Beyond Sol, most of which will be fun. Just don't do it on a huge map or you will end up re-doing your game because of a poorly optimized engine.",
