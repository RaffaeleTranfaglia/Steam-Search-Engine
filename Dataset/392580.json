            "review_text": "Warshift is a RTS/3rd person shooter hybrid. Those who remember and liked Battlezone will feel similarities at once. Scroll down for a tl;dr.  You command a futuristic force that is built around an assault carrier (think helicopter carrier of modernity) fighting an enemy. The lore has human cyborg based army fighting against an alien invasion of a colony on a remote planet. Your assault carrier serves as a command center of any classic RTS, serving as a core for a base. Barracks, factories, turrets, resource extractors, infantry, tanks, aircraft... your typical RTS bread and butter. I mean that in a good way. In addition to it, you are also able to jump into the battle controlling an avatar, which is a particularly powerful vehicle (there are several different versions, from a good old tank to a flying submersible dinosaur looking walker to a katana armed jet pack commando) that enables you to tip the scales into your favour when ordinary units clash. This means you are effectively a one man fire brigade, moving from area to area lending hand where attack is most dangerous if on defense or moving together with that big bunch of tanks and infantry you just sent toward the enemy base on offense. If you get yourself killed, you respawn after some time in the carrier. In addition to these RTS and action elements, there's the dash of RPG in ability to level up and equip your avatar with different weaponry as well as equipment providing passive increases to various stats while inside the carrier.  First off, a warning: It is at the moment very bare bones, with only a few skirmish maps and a campaign that is lacking any real story (that can be found on the website and is very short and basic anyway) and explicit story-wise connection between missions. Campaign missions are themselves for the most part just a streak of skirmishes or if not that very lightly scripted but still using same maps as skirmish. People looking for a quality single player storyline experience should keep clear for now because that's something they won't find here at all. What remains is skirmish and multiplayer.  Now that that's out of the way, the game is otherwise great. The core mechanics are all working properly from my experience. Gameplay is there and it feels pleasant enough, with only details to complain about and those are being communicated to the dev who is very active and deserves a big round of applause. For example, Battlezone veterans might notice the lack of any ability to command while in action mode, which is a bit of a pain as it requires lots of swapping between action and rts modes. But the dev announced he'll implement ways of ordering building from action mode, so it's being worked on.   Apart from some minor buggy issues (the now apparently famous invulnerable alien fighter in one tutorial mission that sprang up after a recent update that made people decide the game is totally broken but that actually doesn't prevent you from finishing the mission in any meaningful way), things work very well.  What needs to be kept in mind is that both RTS and action parts are fairly simple. This isn't a full blown RTS with massive amount of micromanagment potential, since player's attention is divided between the two aspects. The combination is well done and at least for me taxing enough to be engaging and fun while not being exhausting. The only issue I have in this department is the sometimes confusing moment that ensues after I swap from strategic to action mode in the heat of battle as it takes a couple of seconds to figure whats where.  What I like:  - A well thought of modern take on the underrated Battlezone rts/action hybrid genre. - Cool looking graphics with impressive moments (large battleship hovering above your head pounding on targets beneath it while being pounded by equally large enemy counterpart some way in the distance as an example). - Pleasant gameplay with lots of explosions and satisfying action - in a word: fun! - Massive potential for the future.  What I don't like:  - Still very bare bones as explained in the first paragraph.  - Absence of any commanding ability in action mode forcing lots of rts to action to rts swapping which takes some time to get used to. - Occasional bugs and quirks that were never game breaking for me, but they are there. Unit behaviour comes to mind here, they tend to... do things. That you never asked them to do. That gets them killed. But you can easily reign them in if you notice it and react in time. Also somewhat irritating way you can get stuck on a fairly small rock while driving a tank and then have to slowly back off and drive around it. Terrain negotiation could use a slight modification for these cases. But this too is a minor issue and once you figure what youre not supposed to drive over it's no longer a serious problem.  Apart from this, the game controls aren't exactly fully explained. For example the ctrl + 1 group designation isn't mentioned anywhere but it's there. Also units and their stats, resources and what they are used for, as well as tooltips are left for you to figure out and read during playing the game, without the ability to pause the game to read or understand them. This means that it's up to the player to figure many details for himself. While it's not neccessarily a downside (I kind of like the 'what does this button do' approach), it's certainly there and will be a problem for many. I suspect the reason is in the fact that game is still being worked on intensely so things were added after the tutorial missions were designed.  So tl:dr:  It's still a rough game that will repulse those seeking for a complete, static and done product. But it's very fun, the core mechanics are there and are all good, majority of the roughness comes from the fact that campaign is very basic and game at the moment includes just a handful of maps that are used for every mode of play. Which is in my opinion a great thing because it means all that's needed is expanding on the already set basis, no fundamental reworks needed. If you are ok with playing a game that's being worked on but that is fully functional in it's core, then supporting this dev and buying it is worth it.",

            "review_text": "First off, when I saw this game I immediately thought of Warzone 2100 on the Playstation 1. Where on the PS1 port you could go from Over the Top strategy to third person view on a unit or group of units and wreck havoc on the enemy, Having said that. This game had my attention from the get go. I bought it. When I first played it you built down unit producing structures and the object was to simply outproduce the AI with more units than they could. Its changed GREATLY FROM THAT. I absolutely love this game., As for multiplayer. It requires you to go through a Tutorial Consisting of 4 missions before you can commence multiplayer. Thats what we need.   You get to control your own 'Avatar' or unit independant from the other units. You can level it up and then go back to the ARK which in this case is the home base, and buy upgrades for it. The level of your Avatar also determines what units you can deploy to the battlefield.   They're are still a few UI Glitches. I couldn't finish the Level 4 tutorial mission because my units were not attacking the enemies' Avatar. I had no attack icon when I hovered over it. This game is made and updated by ONE guy, So when you tell him about bugs and glitches, he sets about working to fix them AND FAST! Definitely buy this game. As of October, 13 2016 its on sale for $9.99 What the hell are you doing still reading this? Why are you still here? You're still here? Buddy, theirs nothing left to read, I swear just go to the store page. If you're expecting a joke you're SOL. I",

            "review_text": "Executive Assualt with updated graphics. Good game honestly. As an RTS it works. Not perfectly and I feel some aspects could better explained such as controls or enemy types. But upon launch it was a good game. In fact a great little title. Personally I say wait a little longer to buy or buy when it goes on sale. The content isn't all there but considering this game has only been out for 2 weeks and was developed all by one guy I have nothing to complain about. If you're an RTS finatic or a fan of Plannetary Annihilation I say buy it. The FPS aspect is pretty kick-♥♥♥ and a lot of fun to use. Some mechanics are a little odd. Such as commander needing to be next to energy source to use it. It makes sense froma balance perspective, but it feels like it kind of halts the action. The maps are by no means bad, but we could some more maps.  Oh the game is pretty complex and has a steep and I mean steep learning curve. If I were to change anything here would be my changes. Also here are some things I would love to see in the future -More streamline UI. This one feels a little too clunky -More units/buildings -More commander units -More AI options -More maps -This might be a stretch but I would love to see full FPS integration with any unit much like Executive Assualt  Overall it's a good RTS title and deserves a spot in anyone's library looking to have some fun. Best RTS ever? No, but it certainly deserves a spot in my roster. Fun, innovative, and something new to ♥♥♥♥ around with.  8/10. If it is on sale no excuse to not pick it up.",

Set up the right combinations of forces and you can just sit back and all you will have to do is some spot coverage with your Commander 'Avatar' to make sure you don't loose the base.  Its not bad by any means. Its fun and quite unique in its own right. A kind of Transformers meets Total Annihilation kind of feeling to it.  I'd say give it a shot.",

You can get the feel for an RTS however it is very 'lane' based and for someone who isn't a fan of MOBAs I was hoping I could play this like a pure RTS. You cannot.  to Upgrade units you have to use the FPS part to kill and be able to upgrade your hero otherwise you will always be at level 1 and unable to get better units. The AI seems to be able to upgrade units overtime. I only played 36minutes which was one full skirmish match nearly of me struggling to keep up. For 20/36 minutes the enemy never left their base, yet they started to send units which were starting units, never their hero though. 25/36minutes they had level 3 units. 30/36min they had massive airships and units that could hit me from a long distance and might I mention AI never miss.  I think you might enjoy this if you like MOBA's, I would classify this as a Sandbox MOBA before I ever label it an RTS. I do not recommend this game to anyone who is hoping for a FPS AoE sort of game.   (in the mind of RTS) ___Pro___  - build units - FPS Factor  ___Con___ - Not an RTS - Have to use FPS/Moba to advance (get better creeps/mobs/buildings) - Lanes only(no open world), very few maps, terrain (walking up what looks like accessible hills to get to a lane) - Resource gathering is horridly simple and harsh   ",
