            "review_text": "This game was a great deal of less demanding than the other experience recreations and the story was short. However the soundtrack and the plot were extremely unique. Controlling the principle character was not continually living up to expectations smooth or possibly on my PC, in spite of the fact that that I question the issue was from my pc. Anyway if the game engineers choose to proceed with and discharge a second part it would be a joy to perceive how the plot proceeds. I would leave the gamers choose whether to purchase this game or not. On the off chance that you like old investigator stories with obsolete garments and decent jazz music, you may locate the game exceptionally interesting. Try not to hope to spend over 10 hours at most playing this game - you will end it up a ton prior without utilizing walkthrough. Enjoy!",
