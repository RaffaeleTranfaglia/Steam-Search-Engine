For starters, you can only grab the leaves on the tree. So about 99% of the game is off limits for your grappling hooks. Tree bark, dirty, craggy rocks... NO. Just leaves. ONLY LEAVES!   They also removed the teleporter spikes that were so important to reaching those hard-to-reach locations. Those spikes were AWESOME because they let you setup your own checkpoints, wherever you wanted. Now all it has are generic checkpoint gates, which are few and far between. Get ready to retrace ALOT of your steps.  And don't plan on enjoying all of that retracing. The game is now heavily focused on, of all things, WALKING! The entire 'hook' of the game are the grappling hooks and they want you to spend half the game walking! What were they thinking???   I really wanted to enjoy this game, it's trilling to swing around like Spiderman or Tarzan, but they've took a great original game and poisoned it with ill fitting and outdated gaming convention. I really miss the old game! The whole game kinda feels like it was hijacked by somebody other then the original developer. Or maybe the original developer didn't understand what a gem is was before. Whatever the case, it's been thoroughly trashed.",

It didn't take me long to get my 'VR legs' but I suspect that people who are prone to motion sickness may never be able to fully enjoy an experience like this. That being said my opinions are based stricly on the VR version as I see no point in playing the regular.  When I first started playing, as much as I loved flying around, I found myself frustrated with how the grapling hooks would pull you towards whatever you were anchored to. It made the game incredibly limiting to what you can do. After playing around in the settings menu I found that you can set it to advanced mode which will turn that off and for a bit, it was better. Having a set length to your ropes, however, had it's drawbacks. It wasn't until I was changing the control layout to enable strafing that I found one that alows you to adjust the rope length.  With the advanced rope and controls this quickly became one of the best VR experiences I've had yet. I think most people with a Vive and their VR legs can enjoy this stunning game.",

I really like the sense of freedom and speed of movement. It's one of those games where the immersion offers a feeling that you cant easily get in real life (unless you go on zip lines or something like that on a regular bases). There's not much to it, I really hope they add more content in the future, but I can definitely take it for what it is and grapple from cliff to cliff and enjoy the heck out of it for just that alone. I would even buy an expansion pack or sequel if it game with a lot of new game mechanics and content. Maybe puzzles and more reasons to climb vertical or traps/pitfalls of some sort to avoid. I mean I know they are going for the zen feeling of just soaring at speed and that is foremost why this game is great, but it's so cool I want more ways to play it. Anwyay out of all the lame things I've purchased for VR recently that I'll probably open once and not play again, this isn't one of them.",

Play it for no other reason than there is nothing else out there like it at the moment. Let's hope they tweak the controls or add more checkpoints in a patch or something to make it easier.

A face-locked message just says to 'keep exploring'.   General lack of polish for a 'finished' game costing $20   Very *very* poor Vive control implementation set by default. If the game requires a gamepad, just disallow the Vive controllers altogether.   I really wanted to play the ♥♥♥♥ out of Windlands when it came out, but I find myself frustrated with the poor controls and general polish, and totally lacking a reason to care at all due to the complete lack of story, atmosphere or general world believability.

All that aside - I love the core idea behind this game. It's the VR game I keep coming back to. But I do hate being forced to do the jump challenges.  Pros:  - Swinging from tree to tree is an amazing experience  - It's stable and smooth gameplay  - Even when soaring at high speed it reacts like you'd expect  Cons:  - By far the worst; the jumping mechanics! This is so awful it is the main reason I'm writing a review. I love the game, but damn I wish we could stick to the core of what makes the game good; the grappling hooks. The jumping puzzles in the game are beyond frustrating in VR. The controls don't help. Honestly it's just such a dumb aspect to the game. Stick with what makes it good. I'd much rather just delete all the BS jumping mechanics out of the game and have a beautiful experience swinging around even if it means less 'gameplay'  - The controls in VR always show the tooltips, eventually you learn to ignore it, but the UI/UX is a bit annoying there. Same with the menus, very dodgy and needs the workflow to be simplified for VR  - The maps/textures/level playability would benefit a TON if you just hired just one guy who was concerned with UX, the level design is so frustrating sometimes, going from easy and fun swinging challenges into near impossible and incredibly frustrating jump challenges is no fun.  - Levels were clearly designed with different mechanics available and need to be re-imaged for the Vive  - Grappling hooks seem just a tad short, it would be much more fun to have them longer so I can build up even more speed more quickly.  Conclusion: Game devs... please hire someone who has some idea about level design and user experience. This could be such a killer Vive game if you focused on the good parts. (levels with mostly just grappling, bigger more spread out levels with longer grappling hooks and higher speed swinging, clear objectives with a skill ramp that makes sense as the user progresses)   Side note: I used to love climb and bhop levels in CS, I played them for days. But this in not the platform for it. Honestly you've got something so great with the grappling. Just focus on the good part and stop forcing us to wade through the BS of jump challenges with a system that doesn't have great physics (at least double up your vertices in areas where jumping is going to be important, the amount of times I've 'slid' off an edge that I was clearly standing on is irritating)  Otherwise great work on an awesome game!",
