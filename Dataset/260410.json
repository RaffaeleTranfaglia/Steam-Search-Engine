Oh, and of course the powerups are consumables.  Started out feeling fun, but the sweatshop-or-pay quickly came through.  GET OFF MY HARD DRIVE!",

Only problems I've had with it is that it takes FOREVER for the game to actually start.

The controls are very simple, and can be played with one hand (two might be necessary for younger players). For every alien destroyed, you earn orbs as currency that can be used for power ups and progressively strong weapons. The content is age appropriate for most players (you do use firearms, but no violent deaths).  As with most 'free' games, you can spend real money to buy currency to accelerate your progress in advancement. There is one achievement you can 'earn' by spending real money, so you can see who spent money on this game, and who didn't. If you are an achievement hunter, don't fret, there is only one achievement that you have to buy, and many more that you can get without spending a single penny.",

I'm giving this game a recommendation but it barely made it.  So, this game is very basic and feels like an iOS game (it might even be?), it only has one game mode which is a survival game mode with hordes coming at you.  Positives  + Good graphics + Achievements (if you care) + Fun to play when bored  Negatives - An achievement that requires you to make an in-game purchase (really?). - Is too easy at first and then gets too hard too quickly, not a consistent progression from easy to hard. - No languages option, stuck with the Swedish that is horribly translated. - Too high prices on stuff, probably to boost microtransaction sales.  Try it out for yourself, an OK game that might be fun to play once in a while.",

Even with playing level 1 - Death over and over again there is some variety in the pattern of the aliens spawning. With that I do wish every 5-ish levels the scenery would change, as well as the music. It would make for something cool to look at and listen to.

The gameplay is smooth, the enemies are actually quick challenging before Level 10 unlike most Tower Defense games, and the concept of the game is very amusing, especially the odd one liners the character says during the game.  The only real complaints I have are the graphics, the rendering of the game and the powerups. Some of the armored aliens sometimes left the armor hovering after they die, the main menu graphics are quite poor. In terms of the powerups, there could be a lot more powerups, and you should be able to access the store mid game instead of waiting for the game over.  However this is a quality game, with good humour and gameplay, and is good for when you want to play a less stressfull game. I would give this a 7.5/10, possibly and 8 if it recieves updates in the future. I seriously reccomend this game for any Indie gamers!",
