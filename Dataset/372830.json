            "review_text": "There's nothing really that sets Fitz the Fox apart from any other platformer. It's got a retro look, sure. There isn't much of a story. But for a game that requires precision platforming, 30 FPS (as of 9.2.15) doesn't cut it, for me at least. On top of that, the controls feel fairly 'floaty.' I'm having a hard time believing that the largely positive reviews of this game are legit.  Not worth it at this price ($7.99), definitely not. But for $0.20 or in a bundle? Why not. Cards. Achievements. Maybe 15 minutes of amusement.   Edit: the 2.4+ hours of gameplay was mainly afking for cards.",

The music is phenomenal and ( I think ) unique to a lot of platform games. The gameplay is challenging yet never unfair. And I loved how towards the end of the level, you included the match 3 blocks! Great job.",
