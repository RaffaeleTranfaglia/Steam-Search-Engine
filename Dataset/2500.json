I love the fact that EVERYONE sees the main character like a simpleton, that needs to do his job harder, hahaha, even though he single handedly beat the living crap out of massive dangerous aliens.   A 'good job' could be nice to hear, but they're like 'Eh... you gotta do your job harder man.'   10/10",

            "review_text": "It's a budget and overtly campy game, allright. But it still gets the job done.  Even though the engine behind it shows its age nowadays, Shadowgrounds offers passable visuals with slick lighting and shadow effects, a setting and a threat that's clearly inspired by the 80's sci-fi classic Aliens (which is always a good thing in my book) and most importantly, enjoyable (if mostly repetitive) top-down action that's backed up with responsive controls and relevant mechanics to keep it interesting (i.e., rolling and the weapon upgrades).  On the con side, the story is a cliched one and it is presented through uninspired cutscenes with half-hearted voice acting. It only serves as a backbone for introducing challenges and an excuse for killing stuff. Albeit mostly boring, it comes with a nice twist in the end that I enjoyed.  Even though not as polished as one might think by looking at the screenshots, Shadowgrounds is a justifiable purchase on a budget price. It's a fine little time-waster that evokes the nostalgia of the classic top-down shooters of the bygone days. Just don't get your hopes that high up and enjoy your relaxed six-hour ride.",

            "review_text": "Going through my first ever purchases in my Steam backlog:  Having finished this a long time ago, I wanted to see how it holds up and finally review it based on that. As an 'alien game' with third-person/birds view, it is now one of my hopeful favorites for a game remaster in the coming years.  Music and sound design is surprisingly good, gameplay is decent, and the weapons works great, especially the shotgun packs a sweet punch. Unfortunately the shotgun also 'jams' sometimes, so you might have to quickly change back and forth to get it to fire. No biggie, as your other toys are super fun to use. Your character and the NPC's all run like they have sh|t in their pants, but the alien animations are well done and the shrieks from the snake ones are terrifying and great.  No tutorial will tell you about the awesome weapon upgrades, so during your play; don't forget to press tab to upgrade your weapons! And play on Hard if you want it to be a fun challenge, everything else is a cakewalk. For a game this old, I'm actually having fun going through it again and for the low price here (or in a bundle), you should give it a try.  One caveat: Failing to kill the final boss within your 4 'respawns' forces you to do the whole level over again. If I hadn't already finished this game before, that would have made my review fall into the 'not recommended' pit. This should really be fixed by Frozenbyte; have your character start right before the final boss fight if he kills you, instead of forcing the player to do whole £ucking level all over again. That sh|t makes me want to strangle a puppy.",

The graphics might look a bit dated by today's standards, but I would think they were decent for a non-AAA title from 2006. The lighting, fire and weapon graphical effects are certainly quite good.   The gameplay is what you'd expect from this type of game (which is not a bad thing), but the inclusion of weapon upgrades and the way this can change your approach gives it an edge over others in this genre.  I got this in a bundle and it is often available on a big discount, so you should easily be able to get value for your money from this game.",

I must say that I'm a big fan of the Alien Breed Series since my Amiga days and this very game here may not be as graphically astonishing as the new Alien Breed Trilogy here on Steam but the story and immersion - at least for me - is even deeper as on the Alien Breed series.

The story behind the game is simple, think DOOM, but enticing and with a twist at the end. The gameplay is top-down shooter with RPG style upgrades. Plenty of guns with plenty of upgrades means plenty of action! =D  The studio behind it, Frozenbyte, is probably one of the best indie developers. Shadowgrounds was released back in 2006, but they are still supporting the game and helping players on Steam forums etc.  The ONLY downside of this game is, really, the lack of coop over internet. There IS coop, but sadly it's local 2-4 player only, so you'll need many gamepads lol.  Overall strongly recommand this game to everyone. Especially now it's dirt cheap, and when it goes on sale it costs like nothing lol.  also a tip: the game does not support widescreen by default but widescreen works fine if you edit the resolution in its config file located at 'Steam\\steamapps\\common\\Shadowgrounds\\Config\\options.txt'",

Yes the controls are smooth, the graphic ok (for the time) and it's well executed in general, but there're too many bad things: 1)you can't counter enemies; in many other games, enemies have weak points you can shoot or use to ease the combat, or at least they have attack patterns to let you avoid some damage, in this game enemies give you no chanche to survive, you can't avoid attack in any way, and you have to expose yourself to attack them. 2)not enought ammo; powerful ammos are never enought and you'll run out of ammo shortly, leaving you fighting 4-meters-tall monsters with bouble machine gun with a pistol or a shotgun (if you're lucky) 3)enemies coming from nowhere; the game gives you the feeling that if you clean up a room it will stay clear so most of the time so don't care too much about your shoulders, but sometimes enemies appear behind you and you'll find yourself sorrounded and with your health-bar drained even before you realize what happened. I said 'appear' on purpose, since i constntly check the radar for enemy movements and they never showed on in.  so, to sum up, good gameplay bad mechanics, it will become frustrating in no time.",

            "review_text": "picked this up in the autum sale in the Frozenbyte bundle. This game is a great top down run and gun, depsite having 'oldish' graphics the gameplay more than makes up for it. The progression of weapons that are made available to you is good and you can upgrade them too which is a nice touch. The secondary fire for each weapon comes in handy in for different situations. Overall for the price this game was actually great fun. It reminds me very much of those late 90's arcade run and gun survival games. If you just want some straight up no gimmick shooting at aliens and mutants to pass the time this is 100% worth a look, especially for the price.................",

            "review_text": "UPDATE  While playing the game for the second time I had much more fun then on my first run. The game has a pretty good atmosphere, especially at the beginning when you still don't know what is going on and your arsenal is very limited. The dynamic shadows keep the tension up, since sometimes you are not sure if that was the enemy that moved or just the shadow. You can read personal logs on PDAs and computers and learn abut tragic deaths, fun jokes on the workplace while things were peaceful, and learn about what was happening before the events in the game. This is all just like in Doom 3, but it's still fun.  The soundtrack is pretty good and sets the mood just right, and when a large battle starts the music gets more energetic and makes you ready for the battle.  The maps are HUGE, some can take more than half an hour to finish, and first few levels are more open, so you can enter a building from various points. All the weapons are very fun to use and you can upgrade them. The upgrade system makes you explore the maps more, so you can kill more enemies and get the upgrade parts sooner.  There are not many enemies in the game, but they are all very different, and require slightly different tactics and weapons. Some run at you and jump, some get invisible and you need to use the flashlight to see them, some have shields on front, so you need to sneek from the back, some throw goo at you and slow you down... Unfortunatelly the AI is very limited, and sometimes they get stuck.  I enjoyed the story too, it is nothing groundbreaking, enough to give you some context and keep you going, but the ending was a surprise. I'm glad I replayed this game and now I think it is a much better game than I first thought.   *** OLD REVIEW ***  This game is a definition of a '7/10' game. There is nothing wrong with it, but there is also nothing special about, it's just good. After almost 20 years of playing games, somehow this is the first top down shooter I ever played.   Graphics and sound    I think the graphics look pretty good, nothing fancy though. You could say they look cartoony by today's standards.  The game misses some sounds. Like when you walk you hear no steps, I felt it was awkward. Also you would expect those big enemies to make stomping sounds when they walk close.  The voice acting is not good, especially for the main character. It's like he was sitting on the toilet reading newspapers and not fighting an alien invasion.  You get two types of music in this game; the 'ambient music' is nothing special, but 'fight' music (which sometimes plays when something important happens or when there is a large fight) is great, and I added those to my music library.   Gameplay    The weapons are the standard 10 weapons you would find in every shooter released before 2007. Except for the upgrades it's nothing new, but still fun to use.  Unfortunatelly there are not many different types of enemies in the game. Most of them do require different tactics and weapons to fight them, so that's a plus.  The AI is not great, both for the enemies and NPCs, they sometimes get stuck. Few times when you have company they are not very helpful (the female lead character just uses a gun, would be cool if you could give her some of your weapons like in The Thing).  If you watched Aliens, or played Doom, the story will be familiar. You can read PDAs and acces computers to get some backstory, but you wont miss much if you skip those.   Conclusion    I'm sure I would appreciate this game more if I played it 10 years ago when it was first released and when I was younger. There are probably better similar games out there now. This was the first game from Frozenbyte and with just a bit more polish(read budget) it could have been not just good, but great. With that being said I'm curious what they did with the sequel Shadowgrounds Survivor. I'm definitely playing that next.",
