            "review_text": "It's not pretty. It's not flashy. Theres no story. It's full of dumb jokes and laughable 'Characters'.  But after an hour of play; it's got tight controls (Didn't find a way to remap, but honestly, I was too busy playing the game to really look), an easy to navigate UI, easy to understand but difficult to master AI, and the upgrade/ship system adds something I've never really experianced before in the genre. The soundtrack is pretty sweet, too, and I wish I could get it as a DLC (In Lossless format, please).  In short; it's a diamond in the rough. Even at full price ($1.99 at the time of this review), it's worth the coin and I got it on sale. I've paid a lot more for a lot less. Fans of the genre; get this. It's not perfect, but it IS enjoyable.",
