            "review_text": "I recommend this game for those who wish to take an interest in traveling to this. I have gone to Japan many times before and this game reminded me of my guide as a service i had in 2010. They showed me many of these areas before and provided their share of interest. Playing this game also reminds me of the different foods though. Thoroughly a good game guide to a basic level. however I recommend that if you do travel choose between Kansai and Narita. The one in 2010 took Narita as It does say here. It provides a nice insight to the areas many do want to visit and obviously quite nice they put the USD Converters to Yen because it is that helpful. Believe it or not, this game is great. At a good price. I recommend it 7-9/10 in it's own way. I just wish there were more travel locations and foods. The game mentions the usual attractions and a story between you and these two. However replayable is necessary due to limited days. Locations include popular shrines, Akihabara, Shibuya's Hachiko, and Mt. Fuji. In it's right, it's worth the buy and on average it's short but educational. Plus those who want to take a look into Japan, this is a more accurate version with the matters of scenery, travel, and places. If you do go and don't know anyone, grab a guide and trust me you won't regret it. Just remember though don't think too high and bring a lot of cash. Trust me this game may keep the rate the same but in RL, the exchange rates can change so fast during hours of the day. If I were to give it a score. 6.4-8 due to it's playthrough, limited area, good story, dialogue, but it lacks location, extended travel days, and covers one area. Yet as it is a game, I can say it did it's job right with the guides. So for in total the average would be a 7.5-7.8. Although this game was released in 2011, adding it here will help those who didn't know much. Either way enjoy the game for what it is. I know I did, just wished that we had another version, different guides, different area, you know. Needs that litle extra. Still good in it's own right. Enjoyable.",

            "review_text": "Go! Go! Nippon! is a short Visual Novel based on the idea of someone visiting Japan for the first time.   Of course you as the main character speak really good Japanese, and is also an Otaku. The story is mostly centered around you exploring Japan in the company of two girls who take turns going with you depending on where you decide to visit. The nudity tag doesn't really belong on this game but whatever.  Personally the story felt as if it was a bit lacking because of the nature of the premise: visiting Japan for the first time. There are few choices that you can make that make any difference and only two endings.   Overall it can be an entertaining game if you're in the right mood, just don't expect much from it. If you want to visit Japan though, it has cool features like being able to hit a button and see what that specific location looks like on google maps from a street view. I found this to be interesting as I wouldn't know exactly where to look for those specific attractions.   Though it's not amazing, it's still worth the playthrough twice if you get it at a discount on the base price. If you're VN lover, you'd probably rate it higher than my 5/10.

'Choose your own adventure' roughly translates to 'This ♥♥♥♥ game doesn't even have steam cards or emoticons why did I even buy it' there is no literal translation as far as I'm aware.  The game has a very neatly arranged selection screen, giving you a total of four different options that might lead you to different things. The options are in this order from left to right (This is important because I've been told that this is a Japanese game and Japanese people read upside down) 'Start', 'Load', 'Config' and last but not least 'Exit'. The 'Exit' button closes the game, it is the only button I pressed so far so I am not sure what the others do, my Japanese is a bit rusty.  Greetings",

They tried to add a little fanservice and flavor by making you stay with two females but don't expect much besides decent amount of major tourist spots and japanese reading practice as a side option.

This game is amazing, you get to plan exactly how your trip will go by visiting major hotspots (I recommend going to Akihabara ^_^). You also get to see plenty of famous Japanese dishes like Omurice and Ramen (YUM!! P:). Everyone speaks Japanese in the game too, to immerse the player more. Now I can plan for my trip and practice my Japanese at the same time, which is really sugoi* (sugoi means awesome in Japanese). And the women in Japan are gorgeous as shown in this game. When I go to japan, I hope I too can stay with two beautiful sisters.  As for the H-scenes though, they are fairly vanilla and lackluster in general. Nothing like the Violent ♥♥♥♥♥ Inferno VN that I usually play, but I can't really complain since I got this for planning purposes. So over all, this is a really solid VN that I highly recommend.",

            "review_text": "This game is my first visual novel, so I can't compare it to others. As a standalone experience, it's interesting. You play a tourist coming to Japan for the first time, staying with a couple of brothers you met on the Internet. The brothers turn out to be sisters - shocking! and also, you forgot to ask and apparently never shared a pronoun - and in among the inevitable progress to seduction (you only get to fall for one of them per game) there's a lot of first-time tourist information about visiting Tokyo and the environs, along with light language lessons and some good practical advice about tourist mistakes to avoid. Which is actually pretty cool. I've never been, but now I'm quite curious.   There's no nudity; the Steam game tag is wrong on this score. You manage to catch each sister minus some clothing by forgetting to knock and then forgetting to look away or close the door, but the pictures are PG-13 in nature, if not intent. Apart from that it's all about True Love, and in fact the game gets embarrassed pretty easily, like if anything ever even remotely suggests that people might be physically attracted to each other. The number of awkward-pause ellipse screens to click past [...] is staggering.   There are two endings (one each for matching with each of the sisters), and if you check a game guide, as I did after my first play-through, a couple of judicious saves and liberal use of the 'Skip' button will let you play quickly to the other ending and give you the couple of scenes you missed by choosing this restaurant instead of that one, and so forth. Acing one or two of these alternatives unlocks extras that will let you look at the pictures of your times with Makoto and Akira, replay scenes, and give you an index of information about the sites you visited - you can also click through in-game to Googlemaps pictures of the places you go.   The game definitely wants you to end up with one sister rather than the other, or so it seemed to me. They will both fall for you if they're called on to do so, but one harbors a quiet crush and the other is all 'Hi, I'm the hot one but don't let me near the kitchen.' Goofy, but absorbing.",

It is an educational Novel that teaches you about a few of the most important sights in Tokio, and even some of Kyoto. Quite interesting  Story:  Our young Hero gets to visit Japan for hist first time, he got to know 2 guys via Internet who offer him a place to stay as well as show him arround. But Surprise PLOT TWIST the 2 guys are actually girls, our Hero misinterpreted the names as guy names. hahaha So they let him sleep at their house and show him arround. You get to choose what sight you want to visit  Ofc there will be a romance between the protagonist and one of the 2 girls.. i mean its a novel all right. ^-^ (the side romance parts are actually pretty good)  Pro: - Money system. At the start of the game you can add your value to yen price. (eg 1€ = 100000 yen or use realistic values like the current ones). When the protagonist spents money on sth it gets calculated in the end of the day. The prices are more or less realistic prices, so you will see how expensive a trip to japan will be if you dont have to pay for a place to stay, realy awesome for those who plan to visit japan. - Actually explains about history and habbits a bit - Cute romance story - Realy good €/h value if you play every sight and considder the information you get. - Good backgrounds used - Cute character design - Realy good Music - Protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥   Con: - Not realy 100% all ages, there are 2 short barely dressed scenes, which are hilarious and i don't considder too bad, but im counting this as con as its not appropiate for children to see (still, its like 1 or 2 minute maximum of the whole game) - Protagonist is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ^^  ~95/100 due to heavy educational value, planing value and fun in general.

Yep, gastronomy, this trip introduce us to a great variety of japanese foods, i could almost taste it and smell it.  Both girls are really lovable and charismatic. They will make you wish that trip never ends.  So if you want to know more about Japan, but can't go personally, this game is a must have for you.",

As the 'About This Game' section says: 'a guidebook in game format!'  Playing through this game brought a lot of nostalgia of my times in Japan. Some information is outdated, like the SUICA and PASMO cards (there's an app for both!), but I guess that's to be expected from a guide made back in 2011. It has it's amusing moments due to some really cliche moments, but I guess that's its charm. If you're interested in visiting Japan, I think this game is a good introduction to the culture as well as some tourist locations. However, it's definitely not something to rely, since it's not your own personal experience.",

The game will introduce Japan's various vacation / historical / interesting spots and depict them to you through these two girls. You will make some choices of where to go, limited in one playthrough so you need multiple playthrough to visit all places. You might also open Google Maps for the particular places you're currently in the game (there's in-game link to that place's coordinate).  Overall, the graphic, sound and story materials are well done. If you're not familiar at all about Japan, this game will be a good introductory material for you as you won't be bored to death reading some literature or pages from Google.

Get it when it's on sale.  7/10   Longer review:  The story itself is standard. You are a tourist from the west who's lifelong dream is to visit Japan. While he's there he'll be staying with two siblings who he, at first, assumes to be boys but he is later mistaken. It doesn't take long before he settles in, meets his hosts and sets out to see sights and taste food, with great travel advice along the way.  At first the characters, particularly the protagonist, seem like they would get on your nerves, but within about 10 minutes this is sorted out. At first the main character seems to be some kind of hermit, dropping his jaw at everything he sees, but shortly after his arrival he becomes a likeable, if a little bland, character. Nothing worth complaining about, but he's not exactly winning any awards. The two sisters who act as guides for the protagonist have far more personality than he does, and later on in the game you will get quite attached.  'Go! Go! Nippon!' is a great visual novel for those who are interested in visiting Japan. You can set the Dollars or Euros to Yen rate and as you purchase items in the game it will give you a realistic total of what it would cost like in real life. The two sisters guiding you around the various locations of the country have lots to say and you can learn a great deal about the history of both main and hidden-away tourist destinations.   In conclusion, a pleasant story that you should definitely pick up if you are interested in travelling in Japan. The advice and history you get throughout the game is awesome and unique. It is a little pricey for what you get, so I recommend waiting for a sale.  7/10",

            "review_text": "I enjoyed this visual novel. It gave me a taste of what the different districts of Tokyo are known for, and provided just the right amout of interesting history behind them without getting lost in details.  This story is about a teenage boy's first trip to Japan to spend with two friends he knows online, Makoto and Akira - but, much to his surprise, they are attractive teenage girls, not boys. Their parents are away, so he spends the week touring various parts of Tokyo with them.  There are six districts to visit; you can choose one to visit on each of the first three days (meaning that you can only see half of them on a single playthrough). Depending on which district you choose, one of the sisters will come along with you for the day (there's no way to know which until after you choose). Days four and five are an overnight trip (via Shinkansen) to Kyoto with both of them, and then day six is spent with whichever girl joined you more often on the first three days, So there's a light romance plot tacked on here that ends up with you falling for whichever sister you spent more time with; there's no real way to choose which one to love, but since Makoto will come with you to three of the districts and Akira to the other three, a second playthrough will let you see the other three districts and the other sister's ending. You've got more say over a few other choices long the way (like, what do you want for dinner: pizza, Japanese pizza, or sushi?). I spent about four hours playing through the story twice (and making liberal use of the handy 'Skip' button the second time through).  One of the story's strengths is that every line is displayed in English, with the Japanese translation of it displayed in kana - very handy if you're learning. Also handy is that the text is displayed in different colors depending on who's speaking it. (No voiceover here, unfortunately.) An odd feature is that it asks for the current dollar/yen exchange rate and then displays your running expenses, so you have an idea how much your trip is costing you. One tidbit I stumbled upon by luck: while there are many ways into the game's menu, the only way out is to right-click. Until I discovered that, I was frustrated at being trapped in the menu.  The only really unfortunate thing about this story is that you'll walk in on one sister bent over in her panties, and the other sister (tastefully) naked. That alone kept me from recommending this to a neighbor's kids before their trip to Japan, and it's a shame, because the rest of the content here might really have interested them.  All in all, 'Go! Go! Nippon!' is the next best thing to taking a tour of Tokyo with somebody who really knows the place and can point out interesting stuff along the way. (And this visual novel is much, much less expensive than a trip to Japan, too.)",

            "review_text": "After what I believe to be 100% completion of the VN w/o the DLC, I can definitely recommend Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~. It appears at first to be a fairly standard dating sim and while that aspect is present in a way, it serves the purpose of educating about the various districts of Tokyo and beyond much more than it sates the dating aspect.   Pros: +Informative- A majority of the places you can see are really fleshed out and given detail, which is very nice. They provide both cultural and historical insight into places that are seen a lot in anime but not explored. It has a good balance of entertaining and informing to maintain the casual atmosphere it generally succeeds in having. +Beautiful- Honestly a lot of the art was just very, very well made and made the experience all the more enjoyable. +Implementation of 'Archetype' Characters- While Makoto and Akira do fall under fairly common stereotypes of characters, the manner in which they operate in the story is unique and responded to their situations really consistently according to their personality. They are endowed with qualities that make them both enjoyable to be with and depending on the route you take, find satisfaction in their endings. +Endings- I thought the endings of Makoto's route was really sweet and Akira's as well in their own different ways that felt really appropriate for how they were characterized.   Cons: +Few choices- Other than where you went, there were few choices that made it feel much less linear than the VN is. The first readthrough took much longer than my second because a lot of interactions up until the last couple of days stay the same. +Derpy Protagonist- At times, it was rather annoying to find the protagonist get excited over literally the smallest details but honestly, as long as you keep an open mind, it's not a deal breaker. +Not Enough Art- There are crucial transition points like on the train when getting an idea of the surrounding is important to learning but alas, they revert to the same shot of the sky as filler for that scene. Again, not a dealbreaker, but just another thing that I felt could have benefitted the VN. +Epilogues- Makoto's was too short and Akira's ending was just a bit too melodramatic for me at first.  Conclusion:  If it's on sale (or even not to be honest), definitely check out Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~ and its DLC which I have yet to try. Really informative and entertaining, and while with a few drawbacks, still well worth my time and money!",

The two female leads do not have much depth, and are mostly there to serve as tour guides and shallow love interests. The overarching story of this being a short trip in Japan is mostly just there to give you reason as a player to be going to these varied locations and, like the two female leads, only offers a shallow amount of depth. Moving onto the games art, it is good. The characters have appealing designs and the environments look nice. The games music is also enjoyable, fairly generic but enjoyable. Each of the areas has ambient sounds which help do wonders to the emersion. As for the gameplay, the games visual novel style controls work well, though it’s hard to mess up saving and loading features..... The game offers a fair amount of information about the places you visit and even has a button that you can press to see a google maps image of the real life area. To me this was the highlight of the game because the game does offer more or less an abridged history lesson about the areas that you visit. The game does a good job of making you feel like you are in fact getting a tour and the games inclusion of background noise adds greatly to this. The biggest flaw that the game has is the length. The game is only about 2 hours long to get one of the endings and is about another 30 mins if you want to get the alternative ending, if you skip through previously viewed dialogue. This game will appeal to a somewhat small audience but those who find the idea of touring Japan with anime girls will not be disappointed. ",

            "review_text": " Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~  is an unusual experiment that trades heavily on novelty but fails to leave a lasting impression.   The game presents itself as a tourist guidebook-esque visual novel intended for English-speaking audiences--this being rather alien territory for the genre--with all the trappings of the genre. Indeed, the attractive (albeit limited) art, interface and scenario design are rooted in the traditions of the Japanese visual novel. Unforunately, the experience is too brief and the informational aspect too slim; the game falls short of both of its propositions.   While the premise is intriguing, the characters are archetypal and the attempts at comedy and romance are tired and toneless. The main character--a foreigner homestaying with a pair of Japanese siblings--is merely a palette swap of the garden-variety protagonists found in lesser Japanese visual novels. His amorous leanings disappoint with their banal outcomes, and the girls fare no better. Makoto is a classical Japanese housewife-type whose prinicpal character flaw is an apparent inability to follow a recipe. Akira is a stand-offish, zesty younger sister whose conflicted romantic intentions toward the main character are too expected and textureless to muster any emotion in the player.   The game scenario branches into two storylines focusing on either girl, though the player receives no warning of how the limited choices to be made over the course of the game lead to which unaffecting outcome. The overall narrative has a distinct back-patting tone when mention is made of various technologies employed throughout Tokyo. The protagonist's constant amazement of Japanese technological progress and paradisiacal protrayal of Japanese life should strike any player familiar with the reality of living in Japan as disingenuous and irresponsible.   As a resource for would-be tourists, there is still more disappointment in store. The various guided tours of areas within Tokyo (and a few out-of-prefecture day trips) feel spartan and excessively-curated. Visits to points of interest within a given locale can be counted on one hand, and each day of the week's adventure ends before it seems to have begun. Wikipedia offers a more comprehensive study of the various neighborhoods of Tokyo than can be found in this game.   The game allows for currency conversions for all transactions in the game, ostensibly to fascilitate budgeting for a similar trip, but the usefulness of the feature is destroyed by how many costs are overlooked. That the protagonist lodges with a Japanese family--at no cost to him, one must presume--disregards one of the most significant expenses of a trip to Japan. Sadly, the greater preoccupation of the scenario writer was clearly the trite romantic comedy woven between the educational passages.  The music is servicable fare, limited to a handful of tunes that never become grating, if only due to the brevity of the game. Characters do not speak their lines, and aside from occasional sound effects, the background music is left to carry the scenes--a challenge far beyond its capacity.  A small offering of bonus features becomes availabe at the end of the first playthrough, though these provide little incentive to return to the shopworn storyline.  Fans of novelty and experimentation will find some redeeming qualities in what  Go! Go! Nippon! ~My First Trip to Japan~  has accomplished, but anyone looking for a captivating narrative or a useful resource for planning a stay in Japan would be better served by almost anything else.",

It's Embarasing, almost painful, to watch a lot of the time; and I say watch because you're esentially dragged along without giving any input save one choice each day (well, really the first three days). The characters are completely without depth, kind of blank slates, except where they are extremely cliché or stupid. The main character is just painfully thickheaded.  There's some replayability value because you can't go to all of the places in one playthrough.  There's some useful information, it does feel kind of like a week in japan, you get a sense of the places you go to. But it's not really worth it for the poor dialogue and fanservice. I have been to Tokyo for a bit over a week and I think that the game gives you a pretty good feeling (albeit superficial) for what the places that they go to are like. The backgrounds/scenery is very good but I can't help but feel like for all the work that must have gone into the background paintings they could have made some more expressions for the characters.  Overall it's a great idea that lacks a lot in execution. If you're interested in Japanese culture, you'd be better off buying a good guidebook, learn the language and go there.  Overal did I enjoy playing the game? Yes, if only for the nostalgia of the places they go to. Do I regret buying it? No... but there are better games for 4 euro. Can I reccomend it to others? No, not with a clean conscience.",

I'm not sure exactly how this game ended up in my library - possibly part of a bundle? - but I decided to give a go since it's pretty short. It's superficially promising - there are some really nifty little travel tips, cultural points, and historical tidbits, but... I made 3 decisions the entire game - which consisted purely of selecting which of 6 locations to visit. I really enjoy interactive novels - this is not an interactive novel.   The tour guides were two cliched japanese school girl tropes. And yes, the protagnist walked in on one nearly naked after a bath, and on another while she was changing. The harem-love-story aspect is such a strange addition as well, because without it the 'game' could have been a really neat thing to use in a Japanese class setting, as all the text shows up in both English and Japanese, and with the afore-mentioned travel tips...  Skip it.",

IMO. The game misleads you by not giving the player any real power as the story progresses. The options don't change much of anything. The pay off at the end is none existant, and the whole game literally drags you by the hand, and slaps you if you want to do something else. The characters are basically blank sheets. They have no personality, they are dull. This is similar to what the twilight series did, by creating a character so void of anything that most people could easily assume that role.   Which is why I am giving this game a shocking... 10/10 WOULD BANG.",
