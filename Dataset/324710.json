            "review_text": "To Be or Not to Be feels like being told the story of Hamlet by a really good friend -- one with whom you share a goofy sense of humor and a lot of off-kilter inside jokes -- but there are a few issues I'm hoping to see fixed.  First, let me be direct here: I love To Be or Not To Be. I like that I can play a storyline in the 10-minute breaks between my classes; the writing style, humor, and references work for me; and the game singlehandedly convinced me to nickname my car Ophelia (+1 to science, -1 to water, and +10,000 to badassery). This is also a game where it is really fun to achievement hunt -- achievements tip you off to lots of silly but non-required moments, and chasing them down is a good way to structure your playtime.  That said, the humor relies a lot on the inherent silliness of juxtaposing Hamlet with modernity and may not hit the mark for everyone. Additionally, a lot of humor is milked from the narrator being exasperated with and/or railroading you, a la The Stanley Parable. I found this funny, but given the way To Be or Not To Be is checkpointed, I understand why others might find it frustrating.  And that brings me to my biggest problem with To Be or Not To Be: the checkpointing. Checkpoints are infrequent, and while they mostly come at sensible points (at any major scene/plot turn), you'll still end up skipping a lot of text to get back to that one spot where you didn't take the other branching path. It's a minor annoyance, but it's still an annoyance.  Additionally, for whatever reason, only some of my checkpoints (and ending art!) ever persist after exiting the game -- this is a known bug, and I'm hoping it'll be patched soon. [Edit: This has since been remedied!]  A lesser problem is the sound controls. Although the music and narration volumes have been adjusted since release so the former no longer totally drowns out the latter, there's still no sliders; you can only turn things on or off. My advice: Skip the narration and leave the music on. It's more fun to read the story in your own voice and give the words your own emphasis anyway, and the music really adds to the scenes and the humor in a way that the narration doesn't.",

This is just a superb rendition of the book that he wrote, and includes all the collaborative works of other authors as well. I had a really good time also reading this choose-your-own-adventure aloud to my friends and having them choose! Worthwhile as a game for sure if you enjoy novels, or if you WOULD enjoy novels if they were more interactive and less paper-y. Couldn't recommend more!",

Based on a book by Ryan North, the popular author of the Dinosaur comics (you know the ones), this game is a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure without all the hassle of turning pages and trying to mark where you left off so you can go back if you die. So convenient! I highly recommend this game.",
