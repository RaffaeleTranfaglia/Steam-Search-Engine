            "review_text": "Weather Lord is a series of casual time management games, with Victor as a young hero able to manipulate the weather. However, Victor wasn't always the hero there as previous games were showing more humans and less cute animals.  Anyway, Victor managed to defeat his evil uncle but it seems that a princess needs his help as she's a prisonner of an ancient evil. Besides, her kingdom needs some restoration, as it's devastated.  I'm beginning to be used of the hero being helped by servants/workers and it's also the case here: your loyal friends will be the ones to build workshops or grainmills or anything else that will help to increase ressources (food - you can find them on the paths or you can harvest crops -, wood - same as for food apart that you can cut down trees -, gold - but you'll need your wind power to get some - or crystals - same as for the others). However, your weather skills will be very interesting and needed: you have always three skills. They can be useful against enemies but also for ressources: wind can make the gold mine work, sun can resplenish the crystal pit and rain will resplenish fields and trees. These same skills can also reveal new places or new paths.  However, you can also have super powers thanks to altars (but they're limited in their use and will need crystals to be reactivated): tornadoes, lightning and rainbow. They're useful against more powerful enemies or to clear the paths.  Anyway, you have assigned goals and you just need to reach them to score a three stars - well at least in casual mode, because I didn't try higher difficulties and didn't check if there was a timer.  You have also bonus to help you: some may vary in the levels (work faster, more ressources, etc...) but others can be chosen by you! Indeed, you can find artifacts and choose three of them to help you (skills available quickly, three uses of the super powers instead of 2, more ressources, etc...). These artifacts can be found in normal levels and alternative ones, that are unlocked after finishing a 'land'.  As you can see, Weather Lord is really nice in terms of mechanics and gameplay. However, my little complaint is that achievements on Steam are only unlocked when exiting the game - on some sites, you could be accused of using an achievement unlocker because of the timestamps, when it's not the case.  However, while I'm not really in love with the graphics, they're still good and the soundtrack is also nice to hear.  Weather Lord is a good purchase and is even better than Gnomes Garden and as good as 12 Labours of Hercules. For the price, you're not robbed, though I suppose that you should wait for a bundle or a discount to purchase it.",
