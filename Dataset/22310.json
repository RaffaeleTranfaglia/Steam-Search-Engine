            "review_text": "Bethesda markets Rogue Warrior as a “character-driven first person shooter”, which is stretching the definition of character slightly. The game takes place in 1986, where North Koreans and Russians are doing sinister weapons research. This calls for our hero called ♥♥♥♥, who is ready to stop them, armed with an enormous amount of lovely one-liners like “♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥-breath commie ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s”. It’s like poetry.  This game is only slightly better than the very worst a game can be. The music sounds like it’s from a free music library, but probably isn’t, while the graphics and audio also only meet the quality standard of free template assets. You know you’re in trouble when something as simple as “walking forward” feels bad.   To the game’s credit, it only took me 109 minutes to complete. I was in the mood to play something that was total ♥♥♥♥, and it certainly delivered exactly what I was hoping for. If you’re going to make a garbage game, this is the level you should aspire to hit at a minimum. I wasn’t bored by it, and it had the decency to end early. It also didn’t feel like some crap thrown together at random.   They tried to make something coherent here, something that resembled a real game. But they didn’t have the means, talent or maybe even the will to make that happen. There’s a reason this game is consistently brought up as a legendary piece of crap 7 years after it came out, while thousands of other bad games are forgotten. It’s hard to put my finger on just what makes this memorable, but it’s the “right” kind of bad to leave an impression, which many mediocre games don’t. Maybe it’s simply the one-liners.",

Although it has it's charms considering all the profanity it uses. ^^ But that's pretty much all it is about, quickkilling enemies with the press of a button and swearing. But it's all so sloppy done by the developers, there's absolutely no finish to this game at all. Mickey Rourke does an okey enough job with his voice-performance since everything else is sub-par it fits pretty well.  The guns have no feel to them what so ever. Covermechanics are so basic, it feels like a ten year old game... wait, it IS a ten year old game, say 15 years then. It's nowhere near what Gears of War delivers. The AI is very straight forward. Literally, if you're standing right next to them, they won't see you. Unless your right in front of them. Simple enough to stay out of sight if you wish it. For 2,5€, sure. It's somewhat entertaining in it's own way. You will sure as hell laugh a lot. =)  2/10 (It get's a 2, because it IS stable, haven't experienced any crashes on my machine, the game has som issues where ragdoll and AI and such can break a bit, but then again what game doesen't have that?) It's still better than Aliens: Colonial Marines ^^",

            "review_text": "This is an awful shooter. Graphics are straight out of a 2000 style shooter - think of it as being along the lines of the Original Soldier of Fortune. If this had been a 2000 title, much of it could be forgiven, but it was released in 2009.   Weapons and Grenades are awful. Trying to use the melee system is awful as the game must stop to show a cut scene - too late if the guy cries out to alert his friends.   Exploding barrels are everywhere to shoot at, ammo for your starting weapons is almost non-existant meaning you will be swapping out weapons. You have two weapons slots so choose your weapons carefully. No, nevermind, just take the guns you can get ammo for.  Some weapons just seem to randomly show up. Meh!  Don't spend more than $5. It has some good ideas that are cliche, but this game coming out in 2009 and already being dated - pass it up.  Mickey Rourke's voice acting is just about the only saving grace this game has. If you've read all of Marcinkos Rogue Warrior books, then you'll already be familiar with the cursing. An no, Marcinko's real voice does not sound like Mickey Rourke.",
