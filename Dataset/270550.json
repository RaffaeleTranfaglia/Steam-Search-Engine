The player is free to choose from 9 unique weapon Yet-Another-zombie-defense-game-gameplays and fight against waves of zombies. The game is simplistic in its mechanics, as zombies become increasingly fast and have more and more health. The game as limited replay-ability as the scene does not change. It is worth to buy this Yet-Another-zombie-defense-game game, if you are looking for a simple co-op game. Overall i feel that the game has very solid game-play, and could be very intriguing, but unfortunately it has been abandoned by its developers,and does not receive an new content.",

            "review_text": "Looking at the game yes there isn't alot to it but this is a fun challengeing little gem. Play with friends to experience more fun!   Enough with promotional marketing lets get to the deeds.  Pros: You and your friends can team up in 2 game modes to survive the onslaught of zombie attacks together. Or if your a lone ranger type of person you can baracade yourself into a nice cubby hole lol.   Weapons: Autogun, I haven't got this thing to work so I can't realy give good input on it yet.   Pistol *starting gun* infinite ammo to help you survive the first few waves untill you can get new stuff.   SMG, now this thing won't protect you from a charging zombie horde but it will suffice in the beginning waves of enemies.   SHOTGUN, the shotgun will be your very best friend up untill wave 12 -14 then it does feel a little bit weak but its a lovely firearm that will ensure your survival through the waves of zombies.  Flamethrower, It seems pretty decent for what it is just make sure to have enough ammo / gas or else you will have some problems.  Assault Rifle, I do enjoy this weapon alot it is one of the more useful weapons available.  Sniper Rifle, yes yes and more yes. The sniper is just like it should be a weapon in which the bullet has enough velocity to pass through and kill enemies behind the initial target. There is also a achievment to unlock which is kill 8 zombies with 1 bullet. Gives a nice challenge to the game not a big one but a fun challenge.  Rocket launcher, this is my boomstick and it is used to keep my butt out of bad situations. Very useful when being surrounded by multiple zombies and is quite enjoyable to shoot aswell.  Tesla rifle, this thing is a blast *no pun intended*. When you get enough cash you'll want to try this gun out for sure.  Lazor, Its alright in short. If you wanna try it go for it but the tesla rifle would probably be your best bet if your going for a higher damage weapon.  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  CONS: I don't see alot of problems with the game performance wise.  Needs more guns or a upgrading system to make your current shotgun more powerful. Few more maps would be nice.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   For the price it is $1.99 your getting a pretty fun game. With the Winter sale going on you can get this for $0.67 which in my personal opinion its worth it. If the game gets more support who knows the devs might update it wqith more content.    To the Devs you have a great product going for you right now i'm enjoying this game and I will be purchasing some more games to giveaway on my twitch channel.  On a scale of 1 to 10 I'd put this game at 9.5 its a good little game and all the more fun with some friends.",

First off I have played many hours of this game on the xbox360, this game has been on xbox for several years and still remains one of my favorites.  Rating 8.5/10  Pros - Provide a challenging game experience. - Co-op is fun and provides many hours of fun. - Cheap! ($2.24 for 2 copies on 25% off). - Somewhat of a building system. - Lots of features. - Lots of guns! - Provides many hours of gameplay. - Better than COD Ghosts.  Cons - Game is really hard if you play by yourself. - Not many hours of fun if you play without a friend.  Overall this game is 100% worth the purchase and if you're not sure if you will like the game pick it up anyways because you're not really loosing much if you don't like it! I reccomend this game to everyone that wants to get their moneys worth!",

            "review_text": "Within the time I've played this game, it helps pass the time. It's like a basic tycoon game in which you can earn money as you kill zombies. As you progress, the zombies become stronger and more lethal. Trying to survive 10 nights might seem difficult enough, but getting at any point past night 10 is difficult if you have less than four people. Trying to get all the achievements can be a challenge and makes more goals to go after in this game. What I liked most about this game is the accessibility to auto-turrents and the ability to mount any weapon on top of them, making them fierce allies if you're able to protect them. My personal favorite weapon is the Telsa Ray, which can attack up to three zombies at once, and is basically an instant-kill gun. I love the idea of ammo sharing and whenever some gains a health pack you get some of it too. It was definitely worth the $0.69 I paid for. Even though I currently only have 2.6 hours on it, I expect to add more, seeing a this is an enjoyable game to play.  Some things to know before you play: You can have up to 4 people playing with you. You can customize your server to personnal or to public The game becomes harder as you play It matters where you place everything The Rocket Launcher is not a good gun The auto turrents are VERY useful At random nights, there are sales on various item in the store Never play alone The street light is your friend  Some thing that could be added: Better assortment of weapons New barricades Possibly new maps New characters New game mode (Example: A defending mode where you have to protect the street lamp from the zombies.) Few various tweaks on the AIs of the zombies Voice chat in the game And maybe a few bosses that come out each night during the horde, to add a little spice to the game!  I hope this helped you and gave you a proper decision on whether to buy this game or not, but I will say this; It is defininetly worth the amount of money it is being sold for, very fun and low graphics, meaning you can have a fast gameplay on slow laptops, like mine! Enjoy the game!",

            "review_text": "Yet Another Zombie Defense is a fairly simple top down twin stick shooter with some tower defense elements thrown in. Basically, you are thown in with nothing but a pistol and fight off a wave of zombies. These are the nights. Then, once they're all dead, it goes into a section where you can use the cash you earned from killing zombies to purchase and build. These are the days. You can buy guns, ammo, turrets to place guns on that will shoot automatically, and walls that can be placed to help stop the incoming waves. During the night stages you can pick up drops from the zombies like ammo crates, money stacks, and full health. Health will come back between rounds, but if run out of it during the night, it's game over. The walls and guns become very necessary for later rounds as the zombies continue to increase not only in numbers, but in speed and health as well. You're going to die. It's just about how long you can survive. Eventually ammo will run out, walls will get destroyed, and you'll be overwhelmed. And that's basically the whole game. Simple, but with possibilities and strategies to try. Oh, and there's an endless mode with is similar except that... there's no day stages.   There's also mutliplayer, which is where this game really shines for me. You can play with up to three other people (meaning four players total including yourself). That means four times the firepower, and a game is only over if every member dies so... better odds. Just make sure not to get in each other's way and do your best to cooperate. Playing online is a great way to make this game more enjoyable and interesting, as you can see other people's skills and strategies. I've played much more online multiplayer with this game than single player, and it's one of the few games I actually play online anymore.  I also want to mention how cool some of the other things are in this game. It has some neat music, which is nice. The way you can build walls and turrets to create a defensive outpost between rounds is a lot like a tower defense game, and it's a cool way to implement that genre into this top down twin stick shooter type of game. It's basically what I think a new arcade game would be like. I like it.  But every game has some downsides. The online can be awfully laggy at times. That can be due to distance, but... it's still a major drag since there's no local co op for this game, another downside. Also, while graphically it looks alright, artistically it is a bit drab. It's a zombie apocalypse, I get it, but that doesn't mean I have to like the dark, dirty look. Just a personal preference thing I suppose. Also, there's this weird system that allows everyone to use the money to buy things in private games with friends, but in random online matches there's no way to do so. Only the host can buy things. It works out alright, but the fact that it's inconsistent is strange to me, and not really explained anywhere either. The heads up would help. Speaking of that, it'd also be nice to get a little warning on the turrets. See, you buy the turrets from the shop and then you can place them. Pretty easy to figure out. What's confusing is that you're supposed to mount a gun on them. This could've been conveyed a little better. Many times newcomers will buy a turret and place it then be confused as to why it won't shoot. Well you have to have another gun to mount on it. And that gun also uses ammo. You start with many extra pistols to mount to them, which is nice enough, but being given a small heads up on a few of these features might have been nice little things to add. Also, there are supposedly more updates coming... but they're taking long than expected as well as longer than announced. So don't base your purchase on new features coming as it's still a bit up in the air. However, let it be noted that, at the very least, more stages to pick from would be very appreciated.  It's still a pretty fun little game. Nice for a time killer. Simple. Easy to learn. And for two bucks, it's worth it. Wait for a sale even. I got it cheaper and even I think it's worth the full price. Yet Another Zombie Defense gets a 6/10 for being a fun, simple, arcadey experience in a more modern time.",

There isn't much to the game and from a 'game design' perspective it's pretty amateur. However it worked with no bugs.  I found the 'base building' to be tedious and unenjoyable to the point where I just erected a ton of wood walls as quickly as possible so I could quickly get to play the shooting part of the game. I had no interest in exploring other options because it was a guessing game... there's no in-game information about why one base component would be better than another and I really didn't find myself caring enough to explore.  The shooting part of the game is sub-par as well, but not super glitchy or annoying. Aiming is a little wonky as your have to learn to aim above the zombies.  But all in all if you like top-down shooters, buy it for an hour of something different. I know that after my first hour or so of play, I won't ever come back for more.",

            "review_text": " Yet Another Zombie Defense  is quite a simplistic but very fun game. The game offers two types of game modes.      Defense    Endless Night   The basis of the first game mode Defense is to 'build your base by day and defend it by night'. This game mode is basically wave defense, every wave the zombies get faster, more health and deal more damage. This means that the standard pistol that you start off with will no longer be doing any real damage to the zombie horde. Another possible inconvenience to factor in is the lamp-post, the lamp-post is your only source of light in this game which means you will most likely be building your base around this lamp. There are 12 means of defense, these include; the wooden and steel palisades, the autoturret, pistol, SMG, Shotgun, Flamethrower, Assault rifle, Sniper rifle, Rocket launcher, Tesla coil and the Laser. Each of these weapons and defense mechanisms costs cash from which you gain killing zombies and collecting random drops off their dead bodies. All of these means of defense go on sale randomly through the waves which is quite cool, as if you are $2,000 off buying the laser and it goes on sale the wave after, you can purchase instead of going through another round without it. The cost of ammo is variable through the weapons however they generally cost $40-80 although the flame thrower is more at $200. Once again, these can go on sale and you can also loot them randomly off zombie corpses.  The other mode Endless Nights is about 'fighting zombies in never ending darkness'. In this mode the base-building and shopping element to the game is dropped, for a more shoot-em-up style of gaming. But don't worry, just because you can no longer shop for your favourite weapons, it doesn't mean that they won't drop from the zombies as they crumple to the floor. I mean, who doesn't love having a rocket launcher after thirty seconds? During this game mode you will most likely find yourself frantically running around the map trying to avoid the zombies but also trying to gun them down one-by-one. As in both game modes, there are three characters available to choose from; the guy, the girl and the swat.   The game is quite entertaining although it is best played with friends to maximize the most fun you can have with it. I have played both game modes with and without friends and they are both enjoyable. The game is a port from the Xbox 360 version and plays quite well on my system and also offers full controller support. The system requirements are also generally quite low so that is always nice to see with games. Lastly, the multiplayer is very easy and quick to set up and have others join, which is a positive due to the fact that some games these days are very difficult to set up.   Overall, I would recommend this game to anyone who likes relaxing, simple and enjoyable zombie games. Although I would not recommend the game at the current price as on sale, it becomes a lot more cheaper! Depending on your region, the price for a 2-pack would be £0.49 / $0.74 / €0.49 and at this price I would immediately recommend it.",

Neat, yet small, gun selection. Awesome concept that feels unique for some strange reason. Easy to setup multiplayer fun! Bargain!  Cons: Slightly dated Unity graphics (easy to get used to). No gore. D: Miniscule player base. Player models are just down right awful. Postprocessing effects add no difference except bloom (theres only one light) and it still takes approx 10-20fps.  Conclusion: As we see from the pros and cons this game mainly fails to impress only in the graphical department of things. But can we blame it? Not really... who doesn't wanna blast zombies with a friend? ",

            "review_text": "Yet Another Zombie Defense is an indie game by Awesome Games Studios. From my playthrough of it I experienced a good time playing with my friends, which I bought a copy for them.  THIS REVIEW GETS A LITTLE LENGTHY. MY RATING IS 8/10. ____________________________  This game has a lot of potential, the graphics are simple, but sometimes a little too simple. I really hope that more to the map will be done, and more maps will be created. The flat ground doesn't feel like much, and having a map to explore or move around it would be fun, and add to the experience. The map itself is also a bit too small, and when zombies crowd on you, there isn't much room to run.  However, I like the shop and money mechanic. I think sharing money adds to the teamwork and cooperation, but sometimes someone random or your friend can just waste the money on something dumb, and non-progressive to the game. I like this mechanic, but it can be annoying.  I really hope more characters will be added, as my friend usually play as the same person, making it hard to see who's who until I press Enter to chat. I think it would be nice to have a button the allows gamertags to be visible over players during gameplay, and not just DURING the chat.   I love the multiplayer, it runs so smooth! I can easily connect to my friends by just inviting them, and it works so well. The developers did a really nice job with that.  There is a nice variety of weapons, and some are pretty OP, and useful. They work well when you need to take on a horde of zombies. However, the ammo can run short fast, and paying for it is costly. Some weapons aren't even useful (or work well) and they are expensive, however I found myself enjoying some of the cheaper weapons to my favor. The upgrade mechanic is nice, allowing you to upgrade almost after every level.  In conclusion, I like this game. It's fun, and a good time waster. Hopefully more gets added soon, because I will definetly come back to play. The complaints I have with the game are minor, and I can overlook them.   I give this game around an 8 out of 10. It's really enjoyable gameplay wise to just shoot stuff and upgrade, that I can overlook the cons.",

I still guffaw in awe to this title, it works so well. I played this constantly. I got my entire family into it. We built bunkers that barely worked, used so many great weapons. Then one day, I played a round that I got all the upgrades and all weapons. I was the coolest cat in class. Even my teacher, Mrs. Fowl asked me how I did such an amazing feat. After that, I became depressed because the game was so easy it took me 7 minutes to get all upgrades and weapons. I was finished. The game I played so desperately was gone. I used everything.

Even though there are plenty of guns to thin down the horde with, some of them are just plain useless or too expensive to use.  The game’s problem is further compounded by the lack of variety, since you only get one map and two enemy types. Sure there are three characters in the roster, but they all play the same beyond cosmetics.  The lack of play testing in development showed as well, since there are only a finite amount of zombies on screen at a time, you can cheese out the endless survival mode by circling the map “endlessly” for top scores. Or get lucky with a turret sale and get a much higher score than other less fortunate players in defense mode.  If you can look past all that, the game can be pretty fun for a couple of hours.

If it does, cool, play with friends; if not, hopefully it'll be a future upgrade!   The game is pretty simple, survive the night with hordes of zombies coming at you. It gradually gets more and more zombies, zombies get tougher, faster and you're forced to manage the money you've picked up by the zombies otherwise spending too much on defense can mean your downfall because you haven't upgraded your gun to the Uzi or Shotgun for more damage. Turrets are pretty much your friend, mount guns you've purchased on them and they do consume ammo you've purchased as well. Manage everything wisely.

I was a little boy, just learning the value of currency. I'd save and save so I could go to the mall and buy myself the digital deluxe version of my favorite game. er..the game that WAS my favorite game, up until my ninth birthday, but more about that in a bit. I was buying the digital deluxe version of the game 'Bad Rats' and boy was I excited. I had played through the game itself and from the first time I tried it, I was hooked. I played nothing but this...this masterpiece for a whole year and finally got my new version of it. The whole year went by and my ninth birthday came up. My friends and family came and we celebrated with a Bad Rats cake and presents. After the cake was biten into and soon after thrown out, we started with the gifts. They all sucked, except for this one present from this creepy kid that my parents said I had to invite. He insisted on me playing the game he got me that night so I agreed, but he also said that I couldn't open it until then.  Later that night...  I finally got the chance to open that present and man was I excited to see what it was going to be. I expected the even newer version of Bad Rats, but to my suprise and (at the time) dissmay, it was a little-known game called 'Yet Another Zombie Defense.' I plopped it into my system and played after the two minute download to my surprise, again, I was hooked on this game. A game that I liked more than Bad Rats... I know, weird. This went further though, I opened up the case for the game again and found a substance inside of it with a note on it that read 'If you need more, call the number below..' That's when I took the stuff out and proceeded to push it up my nose, just like what I saw on the Disney Channel. Before I knew it, I was seeing all of these colors and I saw the most messed up stuff in my life and I torned back to the computer to marathon my new favorite game while being 'on' this odd stuff...  Slowly opening my eyes, I see my family around me. They all looked at me like I did something wrong, so I asked what was up. My father said that I became hooked on chrystal meth and that I was being kicked out of the family until I got clean. I didn's say anything.. I just left with my laptop, my 'Yet Another Zombie Defense' game disk, and my trusty Bad Rats pillow in hand. I was a nine year old, with a family that didn't like my addiction and a phone number to call the person that would keep me stocked..  Now, many years later, I live in the streets. I'm still addicted to meth. I'm still addicted to 'Yet Another Tower Defense.' I still have my Bad Rats pillow. With that said, this game ruined my life, but I still love it as much as I did before.  13/10 would ruin life again",

There needs to be new stuff such as: Turret Upgrades so you can upgrade the basic turret to the #2 version. Different traps i.e. Freeze traps, Damage over time traps. Upgradable walls so the electric walls do more damage or the steel walls have more health.  There also needs to be a new map of some sort maybe even stick in some scenery like a rock wall that zombies will walk around or something like that.  also if possible, show the damage numbers on the weapons and turrets so we can see for ourselves which is better.

I, as many others only bought YAZD because I got a 90% coupon for it. Honestly, YAZD's one of the very few games that I hold Buyers Remorse over. I've spent roughly seven minutes in this game to-date, And in those seven minutes I managed to figure out pretty much the entire game.  The gameplay is fairly standard: You are a survivor with a supply of weapons (That you for some reason must purchase) who mindlessly slaughters zombies. Most of the game is spent holding down the Left Mouse Button and strafing around the zombies, And at later stages even strafing becomes useless when the zombies get faster. There are two barricades you can purchase (which I found wildly useless) and a sentry gun (Mildly helpful, But you have to relinquish one of your weapons for it).  The graphics (Yes, I know graphics aren't eveything, But still.) are subpar, from the character animations to the lazily done Single level. There's nothing impressive about the barren level, and the only scenery on the SINGLE LEVEL is one lamppost, Which even then has completely terrible lighting.  The UI has a rookie feel to it, With current ammo being a confusing yellow bar and health being the standard red bar, Money is displayed in a green font. Honestly, The UI isn't really bad, though that may just be the minimal amount of elements to it.  For droppable items, there is a very scant amount of them: Ammo, Health, and extra Money pick-ups. Ammo is fairly obvious along with money, But health just gives you full health off the bat. All three are displayed with the generic sprites that you've seen everywhere.  And for sound; I can't really complain about weapon noises or zombie sounds, As you can't really make 'correct' sounds for them. But the music is just not good, It doesn't sound like you're in a zombie apocalypse, fighting for your life. And with that, There's no ambiance (though, That's probably because of the lack of scenery, Not really the musician's fault).  Overall, I honestly cannot reccomend YAZD to anyone in good faith. To me, It feels more like an indie-startup's first project than a full fledged game. I personally feel that $2 is too much for a game where there's nothing but an established gimmick. I sorely regret impulse-buying YAZD just because I saw the price. Oh well though.",

Then you have the general defense mode which lets you build towers and prepare each wave. Both modes are fun but I find the defense mode much better.  It's a great game but can easily get boring after a little while as there is little content, not many defenses and weapons, and only one map.

Add brainless zombies and a little body odor to attrack them zombies and you get this game. You start with nothing but a pistol with infinite ammo. There is a reload bar but there is no reload animation but that aside you get to kill zombies. Each night the zombies get harder and it tells you by how much and where is their stats upped at. So all in all it is a game of kill or be killed. A new way to see zombie killing games where the zombies come to you and not you going to them. Remember its dangerous to go alone.

It's a very simple hold your ground horde defense mode game. There's a fairly nice selection of weapons to pick from and 3 characters, but they don't really matter as they're visual only. The real 'meat' to the game is the auto-turrets and walls. The auto-turrets allow you to place ANY gun you've bought on them and it then becomes that type of turret in effect making this a kind of tower defense game. You can even set up the little walls so zombies have to maze in through your towers to get to you.   Will you play this much? Really depends on much much time you want to put into the walling and turret system. If that's not your thing, then this won't offer much for you. Do I recommend it? Again if you like those things it can be a good time killer while waiting on something else to download. So for that alone, yes I do recommend it.",

The entire game is based around killing waves of zombies.  In between the waves of zombies you can build fortifications and have turrets, as well buy new weapons. I have yet to do that.  This game is extremely fun and is casual gamer friendly. It is fun and is a difficult game. Since I enjoy just collecting Steam Achievements I have been trying for my first 2 hours of play to survive past night six without buying anything. I have yet to get this achievement. You learn how the zombies move and how the herd moves.   It really is an awesome game. Even though I do not hate DLC's as much as the devs do. I bought the game with a steam coupon I recieved after making a badge. With the coupon I only paid .20 for it. I honestly would buy this game at full price, it is well worth the $2.00 and is a nice little time killer when you want to just shoot pixels and survive a Zombie Herd.   I actually do not like tower defense games, but I like this one. Excuse me while I go back to herding zombies.",

You see, on console this games price tag is half of the steam price however to make up for that steam is pretty much always having a sale (Every holiday and more) so it does make up for that. The game doesn't feel complete, the weapons are generic and boring and the defenses are bland and the zombies are vague, un-interesting. L4D 1 &amp; 2 has a lot more content and on sale for only twice the price of this game - $4.99 on sale. The defense system is also bland and just overall BAD. They help in a way but they dont make this game a stategy game, AT ALL. Its just a little game with about 5-10 hours of fun with 1-3 other people, yea dont try soloing the game its boring and its all a grind. Overall its not actually a awful game it has some good qualities one being the EXTREMLY cheap ammo which is nice, and two modes which are basic but fun. The map is also terrible ONE MAP FOR BOTH MODES WITH NOTHING BUT A LIGHT POST. THATS IT. No buildings no roads just a ♥♥♥♥ing street lamp, with no damn street. Okay, maybe im being a little harsh for an indie game, WELL WHAT THE HELL PROJECT ZOMBOID WAS AN INDIE GAME AND IT HAD WAY MORE CONTENT THAN THIS. This game tries to be a new and fresh take on the zombie genre well guess what it is, i have never seen a more repetitive zombie game. EVER. That being said if you get it on sale and play with a couple of friends its not bad, keep in mind if you expect to have 100 hrs in this game you way in over your head by like a damn mile.

It was fun, but it was definetely missing lots of weapons and other defenses so I dropped the game after maybe 2 play throughs in. Anyways I just picked it up again and man this latest update is starting to make it look closer to 25% done, but for 99 cents or even 2 dollars I definitely recomend it especially since the devs have hinted at more updates in the future.  Right now there's 2 gamemodes and I've only really played defense so I'll explain that one a bit  Basically it's just wave defense against zombies and you try to build up a base to live as long as you can, each round you can buy weapons, palisades, or turrets. There's actually a decent veriety of each aswell.  For weapons you have a pistol, chainsaw, smg, mines, shotgun, assualt rifle, flame thrower, tesla coil, lazer, freeze ray, blaster, and a rocket launcher(I may be missing a few) so there is a decent amount of weapons to build up to which you can also mount to the turrets.   For palisades you have wood, steel, and electro.   So for the time being I'd give this game a 6/10 and before the last update it would have been a 5/10 so hopefully with more updates in the future this game will get better and have more replay ability, because right now it seems like an early access/beta game.",

While I wouldn't say it's a horrible game at all, I wouldn't be recommending it to people, either.",

As for the characters, you have a very strict choice. 'The girl, The guy, and the swat guy'. Pretty weird, right? Unlockable characters would be nice.

The only good thing about this game (excluding the trading cards) has been ruined. Now, the hosts troll you by only letting you use a s*** pistol. So you ask for a better gun. They ignore you. You ask again. They kick you from the server.  Who's idea was it to apply this update because I'm making sure to never buy a game he/she has been involved in. Imagine how terrible games would be if this update was appled to them.  Minecraft: You have to ask the host for a stick Call of duty: You have to rely on the host to give you the best gun that will obviously kill everyone  Also, why is it called YET another zombie defense.

Interesting soundtrack Oddly addictive  Cons: Limited chat Multiplayer needs to be adjusted, has a couple minor issues The menu design should be changed, slightly  Overall, it feels a little like a Flash Game with updated graphics  I will also add I had more fun playing this game than I have playing games priced far, far higher.",

The atmosphere is a bit too dark  (the map literally has one lamppost in the middle of it which is all your light) , and of course the map background has literally no decorations whatsoever.  Slightly luck-based, in Survival the weapons you get are by random chance and you can hold only one at a time, and when you're kiting zombies in circles they can spawn right where you're running to  (AKA the only place without zombies)   Recommended at full price!",

The game not allowing some players to place barricades. The game not showing you where you're placing something.  These bugs were not commonplace in my play session though, so honestly it's worth overlooking.  But hey, it was 50 cents!

But on seeing for sale for so little money, I took the dive and really...I'm glad I did actually. This, for the little amount of money to get this game, is a good deal. Its cheap, it's cheerful, will definately kill a couple hours and if you bring in a friend, then you got some fun to be had.  Ok its far from perfect, hell I did encounter a bit of a bug/glitch that i had to restart the game and on controller ( which I used ) the aiming is a bit hard, but for the price, you can forgive it.  Basically the game is a Tower Defence x Twin Stick Shooter x Survival. Build your own little fort and defend it as best you can. Simple right? well yeah, but its not AS simple as it sounds cus of course things get harder and harder as the levels go on. You got a decent varierty of weapons and defences at your disposal, ranging from simple wooden fences to electric fencing, pistols to RPGs and a bit more. A rather neat lil tool is the Auto Turret in which you must mount a weapon you have on your person as the gun. So you can have an Auto tracking shotgun turret, or flamethrower turret defending your base with you.  Granted the game looks bland with the grey floor and single solitary lamp post and yes, I think the game would benefit highly from additional environments and more objects in the environment, so hopefully that can be a thing in this games future.  All in all, my advice is if you see this on sale, get it. I got it for 39p....39p!!! I can buy chocolate bars more expensive then that and enjoy them less then this game. Really, what you gotta lose when you spend that little? 100mb of space on your hard drive, thats it. Grab the game, grab friends, kill zombies. Worth it.    ",
