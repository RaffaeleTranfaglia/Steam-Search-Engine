            "review_text": "Very good shooter/puzzle game. You need to match the enemies so you can pass the level, and still not allow them to reach your life bar. The game is pretty well made and very simple to play.  You are some kind of a spaceship and your only reason in this game is to achieve higher scores, not much else, but the game does pretty well in what it is supposed to do. It flows well, it is easy to aim, it is pretty simple to understand and also you'll probably have fun wasting sometimes.  Since the game is all about the higher score, though, you may find yourself in a state where you don't know what else to do. I mean, you don't have really any objective to reach. Still, this game is pretty good for those times where you simply wants to spend some quick time. This game, or any game like this, would be amazing as a mobile game, where you could play a session while you're at the bus or waiting for something.  Also, the soundtrack is pretty nice and you'll feel pleased by listening to it. And the game is pretty cheap, even reaching some high discounts, there is no reason why you shouldn't try this game.",

I tried different resoltuions: in full screen mode, the mouse just doesn't work and the screen is offset. In windowed mode, it is very slow and laggy. I play much higher end games at 60fps without issues on my machine.  Would love to play if the game worked!",
