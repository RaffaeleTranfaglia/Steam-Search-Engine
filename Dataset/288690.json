There is a lot of sudoku freeware that does it so much better so why waste your time on this.... oh the 'adventure game' aspect right?  Well that blows even harder than the sudoku part, basically you solve 'mysteries' and do detective 'work' by solving the stupidest and simplest of sudokus and each one you resolve gives you another 'clue'. Nonsensical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the biggest insult is the game dares to charge you money for this half baked concoction of adventure/puzzle/sudoku 'game'.",
