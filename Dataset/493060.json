            "review_text": "  Having played this game for a few hours over the past couple of weeks, I can honestly say that I'm very impressed with it! Admittedly, I probably need some more practice with the game... but despite this the game is easy to pick up and play, but harder to master! I'd describe the game as 'fast, frantic, and fun'! The dev has been updating it plenty in the week since release, and I can honestly say that compared to what it was like before, it's a much better game (not that the game was bad to begin with).   There are 4 different game modes with lots of options to choose from for each mode, and each mode offers something different; Arcade is your basic 'horde mode', which you can play solo or with a friend; Deathmatch is a mode in which 4 players (bot or human) blow the crap out of each other; Powershift is deathmatch, except each match gives everyone a different modification to your tank, such as lasers, high speed, and even tiny tanks! There are other modifications, but I'll leave the rest for you to discover. The last mode, Juggernaut is essentially a King of The Hill mode, where you defend the centre point from your opponents in order to become the Juggernaut, and blow up your enemies! Each game mode has multiple power-ups that appear on the field (a couple specific to a particular mode), and all of them make use of the 50 maps that the game has, all of which have different features.  I have no hesitation in recommending the game to people who are into this sort of game, or even those looking for a fun local multiplayer game. The only thing that it is missing is network play, but that's not a strike against it. There is also the fact that the game needs at least one gamepad if you want to have additional human players, but that's just something to note, rather than anything against it; this game would be perfect with you and your mate(s) sitting on the couch blasting away at each other, or at the enemy tanks in the co op mode. One addition that has come to me just now is the addition of a map editor, which would allow people to create their own maps, but maybe that would be better for a sequel instead.  Ultimately, this game is one you can have a lot of fun with, regardless of if it's yourself, or with your friends, and for the price, it offers a lot of fun and challenging gameplay for the money!  My YouTube video which shows off the gameplay, and my impressions of the game during the time I've played it, and my overall thoughts on the game is  here . I plan to do a more definitive review a few months down the line, and talk about some of the things I have mentioned here, as some of them have literally come to mind whilst writing this review for Steam. I will also say that in the video I wasn't aware of the GBP price at the time of recording, though I guessed based upon the USD price; I ultimately settled for using the USD price as it was the one I was told.  Disclaimer: I received a Steam key of this game free for an evaluation and YouTube video.",
