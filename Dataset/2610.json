            "review_text": "I wasn't sure what to expect from this game. I vaguely remember hearing good things about it when it came out ten years ago. It definitely looks like an earlyish GameCube era game, and has a few awkward hiccups here and there, but overall it runs well, and I'm thoroughly enjoying it.   My complaints so far are...  -Key bindings could be more customizable. It won't recognize any buttons other than the L/R click on my mouse. I've accidentally button mashed myself to death on a few missions. The key to throw barrels of TNT is the same as the button to throw your selected grenade/explosive type weapon. One minute you're setting up an ambush in the intersection, the next thing you know, you took yourself out, and failed the mission for the tenth time.   -Does occasionally crash. It's a well done port, but it's still a port, and isn't quite as stable as it could be.   -THERE IS NO AUTOSAVE. If you fail a mission, it'll restart you where you picked it up, but if you quit the game, or it crashes on you, you'll pick back up exactly where you last manually saved. You have been warned.  -Missions can be a little clunky. You have to blow up a boulder, but your tnt was dropped a few pixels too far away, and despawned, so you fail, and have to restart. You have to chase down a bandit that changes sprites in the gang every time you play it, and you'll fail even if you still have a direct visual on them, but they've moved just a few steps too far. You'll fail if you're doing an escort/follow mission, and stray too far ahead.   -Crosshairs are more just boxes, and precision shots are tricky until you have a few hours in, and get a feel for how the hitboxes work. The Sharpshooter rifles are precise though, and since unlocking them, headshots are a breeze, even from horseback.  Otherwise, it's a great game. The gameplay's enjoyable, the story's good, the map design is great, especially for as old as it is. I've lived in Colorado since '97, and the scenery really does capture some of the nostalgia I've gotten from travelling across the plains, and visiting old ghost towns and stuff.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game many years ago for PS2 and sunk hundreds of hours into and 100% completed it more than once. After what seems to be close to 7 years since i last played it i decided to buy it on steam today and relive it. I have a few grips about this PC port so far. Nothing terribly condemning but it is a significant annoyance. First off i want to say that its annoying this game dosent at the very least support 1920 x 1080p resolution. It max resolution supported is 1280 x 1024. Most games of this time made by big companies usually had native 1080p support on the PC. Why this game dosent i am not sure. Its not a big deal because 1280 x 1024 dosent look horrible. This PC port is graphically superior by a large margin compared to the PS2 version. The bigger issues i have noticed in this port is that it has a plethora of audio bugs. So far since i started playing it on PC 3 hours ago i have encountered 3 different audio issues. The first time was right near the begginning after the steam boat sequence loads. The winchester rifle was bugged with the same firing sound as Ned's single shot rifle. The issue went away after i died a couple times but it is still something to note. The second issue i experienced with the audio was a synchronization issue with one of the cut scenes. The Audio was about 3/4 to 1 second delayed with what was going on in the cut scene. The third issue was after the stage coach mission from Dodge to empire. Well near the river bank on the route that you take on this mission after you leave the canyon there appeared to be one of the ambient sounds from the mission still playing when you got within a certain vicinity of the area. That was the only bugs i have noticed so far. Gameplay wise i havent noticed anything yet. Still feels like the same good old game i played back on the PS2. Overall this game isent bad but it isent the greatest. The graphics where pretty shoddy even back in 2006 so it hasent aged well like games such as GTA 3. Regardless if its your first time playing it ever the gameplay may seem dull, and the world unintresting which for the most part it is. The world dosent have much in the way of detail and things to do but i wont hold it against it to much. The shining part of this game is its short but compelling storyline, playing through it is loads of fun and the gun play is quite entertaining. People that have played this before years ago the hit of Nostalgia is great but Nostolgic or not dont buy this game unless it goes on sale. It was on sale today for 50% at $9.99 and i bought it but i would still call that pretty steep. Ideally if it goes on sale for $5 then i say its a good buy. Its steam MSRP is $19.99 and it is by no means worth that much so if its priced at $20 dont buy it. That money could be spent on a better game.",

You're better off buying a 360 and getting Red Dead instead unless you happen to be lucky enough to get past the problems here.

            "review_text": "A friend of mine gave me a physical copy of GUN because he wasn't a PC gamer probably five years ago, and I remember slogging through what's probably one of the most generic,cliche-riddled action games I've ever encountered. I eventually sold the game (back before Steam when selling used games was still a thing; thanks Valve for taking away that revenue stream) but had an attack of nostalgia a few weeks ago and finally decided to pick it up on a Humble Sale for about $5.  I never beat my physical copy of the game, though I was able to slog through to the end and its absurdly difficult boss fight. I never made it that far this time around, mainly because I decided my life was just worth more to me than playing through this truly awful game.  Now, I'll get this out of the way first: certain parts of  GUN  are really good. For a game with such awful visuals the voice acting itself is actually quite good, with special mention going to Ron Perlman and Kris Kristofferson, and the soundtrack is also quite nice. That's really the most I can say about the game, though, as the rest is quite garbage.  The story itself is just...I really don't know what to say about it, other than it feels like an absurd, over-the-top genre parody of actual Westerns rather than a serious attempt at making a good Western itself. Keep in mind, this was originally a Gamecube game so it's not really fair to compare it to later titles (most notably  Red Dead Redemption ) but the fact remains Westers as a genre had been around for a lot longer than video games, and there was so much other material the developers could've drawn in. Instead, we get a very strange arcade-shooter/RPG hybrid that never actually manages to make use of its own logical core mechanics. For example:  There's an arbitrary stat buff given at the end of ever sidequest. There is not, however, an actual leveling system, so it's hard to really keep track of what these values actually represent.  There are kill chain mechanics for killing large groups of enemies in a row with a specific combat style (i.e., chaining several kills with melee weapons), as well as for getting headshots or shooting weapons out of their owners' hands. Since there's no score or level up system, this mechanic feels completely pointless.  There are several instances where the player is given a mounted weapon with infinite ammo and wave after wave of Valve-level stupid AI to slaughter. While this sort of works when that weapon is a Gatling Gun, it becomes ridiculous when it's a canon (and it's a canon most times).  This, of course, isn't helped by the fact which the game is named after (the guns) are themselves pretty bland. Most of the weapons depicted are lever action, except none of them fire this way: the rifles fire on semi-auto, and the 1887 (the most iconic leveraction weapon in history) is a single shot shotgun. While it's nice to see a wide range of authentic Western shooting irons in the game, the fact the developers went to exactly no effort to make sure they were depicted realistically is disappointing.  There are other mechanics which are handled much the same. Your character, Colton, and most of the people you run into are never especially interesting and it's difficult to take any of them seriously. This is compounded by some of the absurd things you and NPCs will both yell in combat (Colt, for instance, seems to think he's in Vietnam and will shout 'Get some!' quite often for no real reason). The models themselves aren't animated well, and there's one constantly reused conversation animation that looks like it'd be right at home in the original  Resident Evil .   There are a lot of people who have lots of nostalgia regarding this game. I'm personally not one of them since I didn't enjoy the game when I first played it and I'm really not sure why I bothered buying it a second time. If you're someone who played the game back in 2005, you'll probably be content with the Steam version now. If you're not, however; if you're someone who's not ever touched it before, I highly recommend trying other more recent shooters instead (such as  Call of Juarez  or even  Fallout: New Vegas ) as both are much more rewarding.  GUN  had a lot of potential, but it never really goes anywhere and that's all there is to it.",

It's also full of side missions that help you take advantage of exploring all the different elements available. It is going to be 10 years old shortly, so it may not look as great as other games but the quality is still there.
