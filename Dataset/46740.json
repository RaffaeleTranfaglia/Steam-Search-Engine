    "description": "World Basketball Manager (WBM) is a basketball strategy game. It uses the same game-play principles as most soccer management games do. Entering the game, the player creates his manager profile and he is hired as the general manager of a basketball club and his task is to improve the team’s performance by analyzing the facts and making...",

I couldn't recommend it because its gameplay is bugged, I even created a 'superman' team by editing the player's statistics and they had problems performing anyway. You also need to go to the producer's site to download other essential files, like the real names of the players and here's the worst part: if you bought it on Steam they want you to pay extra money for new updates. 1/10, although the concept is nice so 2/10 in its current form on steam.",

Nothing quite says 'quality' like finding the game hasn't licensed existing team names, and has decided to just misspell all the team names to get round it.  If you find bad spelling drives you up the wall, this game is going to leave you rather homicidal inside a few minutes. Having every team name mangled means you're going to spend a lot of time wincing... :/",

Most importantly, do you like management games that crash all the time and offer no real sense of achievement? Then ♥♥♥♥ing buy this game, by all means!

Ten minutes was all I needed to realize the majesty and beauty that is this game!  How can this be possible, you ask? Especially in a sports game? A mangerial sports game, no less?!   World Basketball Manager 2010 is a simple game. A complicated game. An educational game.   Instead of graphics of any sort, it sticks to its mangerial roots by cutting out all the fancy schmancy and sticking to charts full of statistics and other information that, while seemingly unintelligble, actually provides the player with a distinctive edge once translated. (SportStatisticGoobledlyGookTranslator DLC $5.99 for those who have no sense of achievement and are unwilling to do it on their own) Yes, once you know how to read what is in front of you, the world of Basketball managing is putty in your hands.  Fan of Fantasy Sports? Well this game will really hone your skills, and give you a challenge should your particular sport no longer be in season. However, instead of waiting to see if your players provide you the plays you need like they do in frustrating reality, WBM '10 gets rid of the riggermarole and cuts straight to the results, providing a streamlined experience in contrast to the usual grind. Don't worry though, because the game manages to keep a bit of realism through unexpected injuries and unruly players that deserved to get kicked to the curb.   Now what if you don't know how to sport? Well, this game will teach you in spades! Not the humdrum predictable actual play like usual sports games, but rather the overlooked, yet certainly more interesting and engaging realm of what goes on beyond the locker room and in the board meeting. You will be faced with the challenges of making a comeback as you deal with a losing team. You will rejoice when your stocks crash through the ceiling as your team ravages the competitition. You will snicker and rub your hands together in a manner most maleficent as you trade off your fluke for an MVP, your rival completely unaware of how foolish he has been. Gaze in awe at the dozens upon dozens of teams form around the Globe that you can take over, all on a whim!   To be fair, this installment is a slight disappointment compared to it's predecessor, World Basketball Manager 2009. However, that is merely a matter of personal preference, and now after spending so much time with WBM '10, I just can't go back to WBM '09!   This is not a game for everyone, it must be said. Some just aren't cut out for the cut throat world of manging. But, for those of you who love a challenge, or are easily provoked, or those who merely wish to see the other side of sports, World Basketball Manager 2010 is the game for you!",
