Devollopper dont make games like that anymore. It is based on the D&amp;D 2nd edition set of rules. It have the most depth story, a lot of side quest and the main quest is one of the best written I ever saw. The interaction between your party members is even better than anything done recently like Dragon age or Mass Effect  The enhaced edition add some cool features to the UI to simplify thing and make it easier for gamer to enjoy it, without removing its hardcore gameplay or any game design. There is 4 new playable NPC with their quest line and they are really awesome. There is more dialogue line and quest and a whole new campaign called 'Black Pit 2' along with the original expension 'Throne of Bhaal'. I cant recommend this enouph to any fan of cRPG. 100/100",

            "review_text": "Fun, but bugged beyond all belief. The 'Enhanced' version is actually WORSE than the original -- and that simply should not be! EG: 1) At least one of the 'rez' spells DOESN'T -- it merely harms the caster and leaves the dead character dead. 2) The pathing of the characters, whether controlled by the player or the AI, is almost offensively nonsensical, resulting in members of the party wandering off in the OPPOSITE direction of where they are supposed to be heading or taking the most circuitous and perilous path to a space mere feet away. The AI will often halt a character mid-path and just leave them there, meaning you may find yourself missing a member of your party during an important battle. 3) The voices cut in and out, sometimes not even finishing sentences or words. 4) The 'triggered' dialogue will sometimes skip ahead several steps, ruining some potential romances and preventing the player from making their own choices. 5) The AI-controlled party members will often disengage or cease attacking enemies, and casters will often stop casting spells or just freeze mid-spell. What is more, many characters will freeze in the middle of drinking a potion, meaning they receive no benefit from the potion but also cannot/will not fight back when attacked. 6) Many NPCs will simply stand in place, refusing to move, which can be game-breaking if they are blocking the only doorway or path to a game-crucial location. 7) Characters can have the wrong abilities for their class and/or race.  It's so bad, it's virtually unplayable at points. Sometimes you have to start the entire game over again and hope that an issue won't occur again. I've literally seen people in the official forums advising new players to just uninstall this and get the original, older version because it (ironically) has LESS bugs than this new 'Enhanced' edition. A tragic wasted opportunity to revive a classic rpg.",

            "review_text": "I am posting this on both the review for this game, and the first in the series, Baldur's Gate: Enhanced edition.  I absolutely LOVE this game, and everything about it, and the other game in the series. I loved the combat, the UI was tight, everything was well-polished when Beamdog re-released the game. I was actually in the middle of a run through the entire game on the hardest difficulty with only the main character...  Before IT happened.  The update to Siege of Dragonspear affected both games, and it's been nothing but negative for me so far. I can no longer access the Command Console (used for fixing the many glitches that can happen here and there), the UI is buggy and, when it does work, is clunky and, frankly, ugly as sin itself. My saves have all disappeared into the wind, and my character's data has become ridiculously bugged (Level 34 at the tail end of Throne of Bhaal suddenly turning into a level 17 with all of the items from her run through BG1 and 2? What?) and more.   Before now, I would have recommended this series in a heartbeat. This game, nearly two decades ago, defined and revived a dying RPG era. But now? Now it's nearly impossible to play. And, unfortunately, it was the fault of the people who brought it back in the first place.  --HOW BEAMDOG CAN FIX THIS--  -Implementation of the old character and save game formatting -Option to use the old UI -Option to turn the Console Command on and off IN GAME. The steps to do this in the first place were a nightmare in and of itself.  --Things that COULD help-- - Scale the difficulty levels back down a little. Insane difficulty jumped from enemies doing 50% more damage to 100%, and Legacy of Bhaal makes the game nearly unplayable.   As it stands right now? DO. NOT. BUY. THIS. GAME. It pains me to say that (as you can no doubt see from my time in this game), but as it is right now, it's not worth any money.",

I played a Lawful good character throughout the game but I was tempted on more than one occassion to switch to the dark side and I also romanced Jaheira even if she was a whiny bint! This time around it was only 242hrs and nothing like the amount of time I spent when i first bought the game all those years ago, though I managed to finish Throne of Bhaal properly and got the good ending :D  10/10 Would Buy again without a second though!",

It would be ok if there were an option in the graphics settings to enable 'tablet mode', but that wans't done.   You do not have the option of accepting these new UI changes, it is a forced patch through steam. That is to say, I bought a certian product and later on I was forced by the developer to accept a different product in its place. There are some nice improvements to the mechanics, but the forced UI changes are simply unbearable.  If you love the original look and feel of Baldurs Gate I would recommend you find a different version than Enhanced Edition 2.0",

Multiplayer on the other hand is broken beyond belief. If you intend to play BG2 with friends, my advice is to buy the original from somewhere else, because the Enhanced Edition's multiplayer is just straight up nonsense. Can't even get out of the tutorial area without some encountering at least 4 or 5 major bugs, including quests just straight up not working, or scripted events not occuring.",

            "review_text": "Undoubtly one of, if not the best RPG games of all time, it was a instant classic when it was released many years ago. It covers around 200hrs or so of playtime depending on what all you decide to do in it, with tremendous replay value in the form is multiple choice dialogue, character creation, party selection, and branching storylines.  Storyline Being of the strongest aspects of the game, it is rich in nature and varied to some degree depending on your choices in the game, which can have a real permanant impact on how it unfolds and certain events that can occur later. The main story covers about 50hrs or so of the game, so it is a small piece of the much larger game with dozens of sidequests and optional areas to explore.  Characters There are about a dozen or so base characters in the game, each with their own unique look and personality. Everyone of them interact with other party members and some may even outright refuse to join you if they see a particular person already with you. Lots of instances in the game have reactive choices as well, meaning they will either comment on your actions or depending on how extreme may even outright leave you. Romances are possible in the game with three standard female options to choose from and one male.  Gameplay The gameplay is largely based on the DnD 2nd edition ruleset, though you really don't need to be particular familiar with this in order to be able to play it. You are able to either create your own entire party from scratch, which can be a lengthy process if you aren't familiar with the game or choose from existing templates. Battles can be highly tactical in nature with many having numerous ways fo being handled depending on your composition, spells and gear. Some encounters will also be different depending on what level you get to them at, being far more difficult if you aren't properly prepared.   Sound The voice acting in the game is top notch and there are thousands of lines of dialogue to go through. Not all of it is fully voiced, but all of the important scenes in the game are. Music sets a good pace as well, with some of them being able to indicate a tell tale pace as to what type of encounter you are facing, with major ones playing certain tracks which you will come to know and associate.  Overall If you are any kind of a fan of RPG games, this is a must play. Deep character development, storyline, relantionship building, roleplaying elements and sheer replayability will have you spending many hours in this classic. And with the ability to download mods for it to add more quests, characters, romances, items and new areas; the possibilities are staggering.",

I would recommend the Enhanced Edition of both BG1 and BG2 instantly before the thing everyone else talks about happend: The 2.0 update. The new cartoonish sprites might look ugly but at least you can disable them. But then we have the UI... in the words of Dr.Steinmen from Bioshock: It is Ugly. Ugly! Ugly! UUGGLLLYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!

            "review_text": "Baldur's Gate 2 EE is frequently (but not always) given the crown for best of the classic isometric Forgotten Realms RPGs, and that reputation is well deserved. With a dark and provacative main story arc, the ability to play as both good and evil with alignment-appropriate companions, side quests with enough content to rival main quests in other games, compelling companions with deep stories, and a RTwP (real time w/ pause) combat system that manages to make combat both chaotic and strategic - BG2EE should be a slam-dunk recommend. Unfortunately the game does have flaws, and I'll use this review to detail these weaknesses so that users on the fence can make an informed decision before buying.    BG2EE owes much of its incredible story to the environment in which its set. The Dungeons and Dragons universe is rich with both lore and mechanics. While the game unarguably benefits from the rich lore, the same cannot be said of the mechanics. The AD&amp;D ruleset, cumbersome and obtuse even in its time during pen and paper play, is a harsh ruleset for a PC RPG.   New players will need to spend a substantial amount of time learning about AC, THAC0, weapon proficiences, Ability Score modifiers, weapon enchantment levels, combat protection spells, spell protection spells, various dispels, and so much more. Diving into the game without a basic understanding of these rules will almost certainly lead to a 'gimped' charachter and near-guaranteed slaughter by certain encounters.   The need for an intimate understanding of the rulesets is made worse by the choices the developers made in crafting companions. Your companions, while having emotionally compelling stories that draw you deeply into the game, will join your party with weapon profeciencies and leveling decisions that are questionable (at best). My recommendation on this is to download EEKeeper and use it to tweak your companions' weapon proficiencies. Problem solved, so long as you have the dicipline to not break the game by boosting instead of tweaking.   You'll find another flaw with BG2EE when you examine how the story is balanced. Completionists (as I imagine most hardcore RPG players looking at this title are) will want to complete all available sidequests before advancing to the next main story chapter. In BG1EE, this worked fine. Every chapter unlocked additional sidequests in a relatively steady flow. Not so in BG2EE. You'll step out of the introductory dungeon with the vast majority of the game's sidequests front loaded. Literally dozens of hours of deep, rich content that will you keep you enthralled for days before you even touch the main quest.   Normally this wouldn't be an issue, and most would consider it a good thing, except the main story arc's hook is to remove from play one of your best (imo) companion choices. This made party selection more difficult than it needed to be, at least for me.   To wrap this review up, which has now become my longest review to date, I'll say this:   If you're willing to play the prequel and immerse yourself in the story and willing to take the time to learn the mechanics, plan out your party choices, and use EEKeeper to tweak those companions - Baldur's Gate 2 EE will be guaranteed to be one of your most unforgetable gaming experiences. If not, you're still likely to have a great time, but the experience may be tainted by frustration and confusion.",

I had played this game since the early 2000s, and if it's one thing I find incredibly fascinating; it's that every time I play the game, I discover many new things. There are (many) areas in this game, and many NPCs who react to you based on a wide array of variables. This is a game for those who crave a game that is not predictable.  There are many classes to choose from, as well as sub-classes within the primary base classes. For example, you may choose to become a mage, but from there you may choose a specialist sub-class (E.G, Illusionists, Necromancers, and so on.)  There are countless quests, and many of them are not even directly related to the overall storyline, but are a glimpse into the rich brand that is 'The Forgotten Realms.'  I HIGHLY recommend this to any RPG enthusiasts out there, and I would also like to say that the graphics look wonderful in this edition. The text is very clear and HD-friendly.

Sometimes things don't make sense. Sometimes people say a little something that helps you along, but that little something is not recorded anywhere. Sometimes things happen for seemingly no reason. The end result? The game feels like it's real. People have their own wishes and desires, and you need to balance each party members' goals with your own. Combat is fun, and very challenging. You can make a choice that impacts you in ways you won't even realize until you play through again, which is one of the more amazing things about this game. Modern games give you 'choices', where you 'choose' good or bad. Baldur's Gate II blurs the line. There are multiple paths to nearly everything, and very few (if any) of them are marked as 'good', or 'bad'. Say the right thing or have the right person with you and you might avoid combat.

I can definitely recommend picking this up if you're even remotely interested in fantasy RPGs, the story is great (although not entirely free of cliche) and the core gameplay is solid, despite its age - this is classic D&amp;D at its best.",

In total, I'm sure I've logged over a thousand hours over the years thanks in part to the modding communities and my fondness for the Dungeons and Dragons and the Forgotten Realms. There's a LOT of replayability in the game even without mods, however. And the characters from the base game are by far my most loved characters from any game series. Some of the writing in the new content added by the EE is rather questionable, but regardless I do love the new characters. I've been playing this game on and off for over half of my life, so without question this is my choice for test of time. I wish I could have also nominated it for villian in need of a hug, but test of time fits so much better.",

The gameplay is more refined and driven, and the story as compelling as before. There are less explorable areas than before but each area does have a purpose. Again the hours required to 'complete' the game are little short of a century, I stand at 87 hours for one playthrough.   The game has improved choices and gameplay, as well as more player options and character customisation. Again the visuals show their age but that isn't why you play this game. It is particularly compelling to import a character from BG: EE and complete the game as   your   character. I would recomend this to fans of the original game and just fans of RPGs in general.    NOTE:   The Throne of Bhaal expansion (included) I award   7/10   . Although fun it was rushed and unfinished off the back of a low budget. It provides a satisfying conclusion to the saga and some rivetting gameplay nonetheless but the storyline seems sloppy which is a real shame considering how compelling the other games are in this regard.",

This enhanced edition is truly beautiful and well polished, it runs like a dream, and everything is in place. The new companions are awesome, the refined gameplay works, and if you never played BG2 before then you should definitely grab this because otherwise you'll be missing out on a seriously epic RPG.  Now lets also note a few things. This is a very old game that has been reworked in a minimal fashion to make it compatible with Steam. As of this current patch gen, the game features an improved interface, new difficulties added, and the correction of many bugs. This doesn't change the fact the game is old! If you are not into vintage games, this title may not be for you, as playing this game is like getting on a time machine back to the early 2000s, which was the golden era of RPGs. As you play the game you would find yourself dealing with infuriating things, like a totally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI, or the awkward moving patterns of your characters. In fact, you'll scream in rage every time you find yourself being slaughtered because one of your companions failed to cast the spells he/she needed, or got stuck on a corner for no logical reason other than crappy AI. Assuming you can see passed its imperfections, you will find yourself in love with this vast, complex, rich, and unforgiving fantasy world, and the people you'll meet in it. What kind of RPGer are you? Role player or power gamer? Well, you'll be happy to discover the game puts both types of gameply on steroids, and gives you a unique experience with enormous amounts of re-playability .   Multiplayer was a big fail for me, but that's because I tried the Beamdog servers, so if you want to try the Multiplayer way, try the local IP type.",

This Remastered edition leaves much of the original features with 2 new 'questlines' to explore, all with some much needed engine and UI updates (with some not so much needed overly highlighted avatars) and well worth the cash to play the pretty vast original story game (if you want to do *everything*, expect a good few weeks of play). BUT if you do find a cheap 2nd hand copy of this game with it's expansion, or even the 4 disc of both 1 and 2 and thier expansions (which would probably play much better on the current crop of OS's), you'd be a fool to pass them up.

            "review_text": "Please read my review on Baldur's Gate I: Enhanced Edition first as that details the general stuff about the Baldur's Gate series. This review features two specific parts: Shadows of Amn and the expansion, Throne of Bhaal. Additionally I'll give my overall experience having played both of these.    Shadows of Amn   You start off captured as a prisoner* in a dungeon underground by an unknown individual whom you have never seen before and he is basically torturing you in your cell for some unknown reason which will ultimately become apparent as you progress through this game. Only thing that will be apparent at the start is that he seems to be trying to bring out some unknown power you have. All of a sudden the dungeon itself is attacked by an unknown group, forcing your capturer/the torturer to teleport out of the dungeon allowing another prisoner who somehow escaped from her cell (gee I wonder how she did that?) and she reveals to you her name: Imoen. After a discussion about what the torturer did to you and her, she springs you free from your cell, and from there, your immediate objective at that point, is to not only escape the dungeon, but to find anyone that is currently in the dungeon to join your party to make the escape a little easier, but you can attempt to escape on your own if you wish, having others with you just makes it easier. Once you finally escaped from the dungeon (you'll end up in Waukeens Promenade which is essentially a place within the City of Amn or rather 'Athkatla'), your torturer, sounding particularly happy (and evil) commends you for escaping the dungeon, the exit of which collapses behind you after escaping. Imoen who had also been tortured by that guy demands to be released and launches a magic attack against him, he retaliates with a magic attack of his own, causing half-a-dozen hooded figures to teleport in to stop it and attempt to arrest him, and after the torturer resists both the hooded figure attacks and Imoen's own attacks, they ultimately arrest both the torturer and Imoen on grounds of using magic in a place (which is later revealed to be Amn) which is prohibited. From that point you'll have two primary objectives, find and rescue Imoen who was captured and settle the score with that torturer.   Additionally in this game, among the outstanding number of quests you can undertake, you'll have class-specific quests to take on too, so for example, if your protagonist is primarily a fighter, you'll be tasked by a kind-hearted noble, with clearing monsters infesting a huge Keep and killing their leader and if you succeed you'll get a chance to become head of the Keep which you can use as your own home to manage as you see fit. Also for example, if your protagonist is primarily a Mage, you'll be tasked by a ranger to help him defeat his ancestor Lavok in what is known as a 'Planar Sphere' located in Amn. That sphere will be yours if you defeat Lavok inside of it. Those types of quests depend upon what your protagonist's class is. Something worth keeping in mind.    Throne of Bhaal   After you have successfully completed your final objective in Shadows of Amn, it is revealed that a certain prophecy describes children (including yourself by the way) of a tainted godly blood, that will cause a wave of massive destruction destroying all in existance including each other. in order to fulfil a certain purpose. You are urged by an Elven Queen to visit a sacred grove to discover some answers as to why this prophecy is even relevant to you and what part you will likely play in it. After you have visited the grove and listened to the prophecy spoken (which also states that there is a person you may encounter at some point on your journey, who has 'the face of an ally', but has 'the mask of a foe'), you are ambushed by what is revealed to be a 'Bhaalspawn' (that's right a Child of the dead God of Murder, Bhaal) and her troupe, whose main objective is to kill you as a Bhaalspawn yourself. Once you have disposed of her and her troupe you get teleported into what is called a 'Pocket Plane' which is essentially your sanctuary for you to rest and take up challenges and even upgrade certain weapons you have into powerful items via the imp Cespanar. At that point, you are visited by a familiar individual whom you had killed in the past, after vowing to never betray you if you let him join you, he gives you intel about the Pocket Plane you are in and states that it doesn't take you to where you want to go, it takes you to where you need to be: Saradush. Once you teleport to Saradush, which is under heavy enemy attack from outside its walls you meet up with a nice woman who is trying to save the people of Saradush, which ultimately becomes your objective as well, however it doesn't just end there as there are many quests to undertake after that, which may involve you ultimately battling other Bhaalspawn that will also seek your death among others etc.     My personal experiences in playing both Shadows of Amn and Throne of Bhaal   Both of these games provide a super thrilling challenge the likes of which no other rpg strategy game is likely to provide, because among other familiar enemies, you'll even encounter monsters/creatures you have never fought before. In my particular case, I always enjoy the thrill of battle, so doesn't matter how hard an enemy may be, I'll always rise up to the challenge. Some will be easy, others will be hard to kill depending on how you have built your protagonist, let alone your own party members.  Nothing as yet, about either of these games has frustrated me personally, but that isn't to say these two games do not have faults of some sort. If nothing else though, I would've appreciated Beamdog implementing more fleshing out of the SoD story ending, to better transition into Shadows of Amn or even towards Throne Bhaal if it needed to be so late, namely regarding a quest of some sort about getting the 'Soultaker Dagger' that the 'Hooded Man' had on him and bringing it back to baldur's gate to prove the protagonist's innocence, even if it meant still being declared 'exiled' due to being a 'spawn of bhaal'.  *Please be advised, that if you have imported your character from a BG1:EE game or from having played this previously, unless you have figured out the trick to keep your items, you'll lose them all at the start, so just a heads-up about that.",

Aside from that, the game crashed 5-7 times during the 1.5 hr of play-time my friends and I had, therefore, its not good for multiplayer.

And the graphics update is completely optional, you can change them in settings, for example. All the haters just want to dump on something and this is a target because of a recent OPTIONAL expansion, which shoehorned in SJW crap.

I'm in college now, and I still think about those first times I played Baldur's Gate 2: Shadows of Amn. Instead of focusing on the story, which I liked, or the awesome stuff I would find, or cheat for, I thought I should focus on what made me play the game again and again:  Minsc.  My introduction to Minsc was in Irenicus' dungeon. As we explored said dungeon, I enjoyed his quirky, funny style of thought and speech. Throughout the game, I grew to love his style. I absolutely enjoyed having him in my party, because he was quite a character. I reached the end of Shadows of Amn, eventually. Since Throne of Baal was not even a thing at that point, I started a new game. This time, I wanted to play as an evil character. My intention was to horde and dish out vengence on whoever I jolly well pleased to. What I failed to realize at the start was that that would involve losing Minsc.  Instead of getting to listen to his hilarious speaches about goodness, buttkicking, and hamsters, I was instead subjected to stern, angry lectures about my actions. Eventually, Minsc left my party. I found others who could fill the role of meat shield, but no one could fill the role of 'Minsc.' No one had the same level of energy and enthusiasm for ANYTHING. A couple of the evil choices I would have to make as an evil character also rubbed me wrong. Remember, I was a child at the time. So I abandoned that character.  I played as a good character mostly so I could keep Minsc. Having been the subject of his scorn, I started to seek his praise. I played as different classes again and again, and I continued to zealously court Minsc's favor. Looking back, I can see how much of an impact Minsc had on my development, and how I treat morality in video games. At some point, I internalized a number of Minsc's battlecries and sayings, and started playing as the good guy no matter the game. I played as the good guy because in the back of my mind was 'this will allow me to keep Minsc.'  I've since developed other reasons for nearly always doing good, but Minsc is still there, somewhere, in the back of my mind. The sting of his disapproval, and the happiness at seeing this strong character devote himself to goodness and justice. Did I idolize that about him? Absolutely. Do I still recall him fondly? Fondly enough to by a digital copy of the game o I can be with my idol and mentor again.  Baldur's Gate 2 didn't have muc of an impact on me as an impressionable child. Minsc did.  Game contains Minsc. (11/10)",

Between romance, rescuing civilizations, personal revenge, reconquering castles or the many social as well as physical dangers adventuring brings with it, all of them are handled very well.  The AD&amp;D rules are a bit dated and players unfamiliar with them will probably need the help of a guide, as some things other than the gameplay itself are quite hard to grasp. For example the damage reduction on certain constructs or demi liches, which make these (near) impossible to kill if the group isn't correctly outfitted. Also the fact that negative numbers are usually better is rather counterintuitive for younger players.   There are also some smaller usability hardships during character creation and leveling (saving before leveling is recommended as the leveling screen can't be left to make comparisions between characters). Keeping an eye on your spells is also very important in this game as there a few spells without which the game becomes extremely hard to play. Without chaotic commands and negative energy protection the game becomes virtually impossible, so read all of the spells descriptions. Also managing arcane spellbooks is more important than it looks at the begining.  Other than this, the game is pretty much perfect: Engaging, lots of fun, nice puzzles, great epic fights, loot, loot and more loot, 100h per playthrough of the main game with dozens of classes and even more party member options.  So let google help you build a character. Save before leveling, so you know where to put your perks and which weapons you own. Read all the spells. ALL OF THEM. If you can't deal damage to sth., change the weapon type or try stronger magical weapons. And erase arcane spells, if you can't learn an important one or raise your int temporarily.

This gem lets you play medium-to-high-level Dungeons &amp; Dragons with lots of content. Now with support for widescreen, it looks awesome. If your job is crushing you, just let loose and crack some skulls in good ol' Forgotten Realms. Too much hype is never enough.",

I think it's still worth playing for newcomers, but be aware that it's *huge* and a bit grindy for the combat.",
