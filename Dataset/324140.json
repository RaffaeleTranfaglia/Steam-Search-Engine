            "review_text": "I'm the kind of guy who really likes co-op platformers. So I'd been chomping at the bit since I heard about the game last December. And Kalimba did not disappoint! Some notes:  * stacking is harder than it looks... you need a ledge or a hole or something to do it * more platform-y than puzzle-y * difficult, but not extremely so (as some reviews implied) * did not cause any existential marriage crises (as some reviews warned) * got very exciting at some points * similar feel to ibb&amp;obb, but we liked Kalimba much better * visual style is very nice * lots of jokes that are ... somewhat funny  The scoring system is up to 70 points for getting all the goodies, minus 1 for each death. The goodies are kept even when you die. So you can get a pretty good score without being amazing, but it's quite hard to get all 70 points (and a golden totem).  The game is VERY short. We completed all 20 co-op levels (so including dark void DLC) in 3 hours. We didn't get 70 points in all the levels, and I'd say there's about a 50-50 chance that we care enough to go back. Many of the levels introduced interesting gamplay mechanics, but by the end thing started to feel same-y.  So if you want to play a co-op puzzle platformer and you and your partner are both decent at platformers, then get this game!",

U may feel hard at the first time, cas it a little difficult to control two character and make sure all of them are alive.   I'm a little disappointed that the game is not so hard in latter part on Day mode.  Night mode is good.  I try to play the coop part by myself. I think it interesting playing it with friends.",
