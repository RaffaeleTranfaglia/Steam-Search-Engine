BUG: In the tutorial you can map the same button for multiple actions. But easy enough to figure through. Should be fixed though.  BONUS: The tutorial shows an old school NES controller. It helps you figure out how to navigate, what to do, etc. Thumbs up for old school retro style!  I won this game (and 3 others) on a give-away. Glad I did, this game looks great!",
