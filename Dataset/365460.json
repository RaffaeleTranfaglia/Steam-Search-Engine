            "review_text": "This is possibly one of the best games I've played on Steam in my 9 years of usage from the service. At least, without a doubt, one of the best titles this year, by far. Let me tell you why that is.  These guys put many AAA Studios that release blockbusters to shame. Simply because these other studios spend hundreds of millions on useless stuff like advertising and marketing, and other unnecessary overhead costs, they probably spend all the money on pizza parties every day for example. But what I’m trying to get at here is that these guys, on a not so high budget, have managed to produce a high quality racer, that is either on par, or above par with a lot of triple A releases. Let’s talk about this in more detail.  The graphics, now I’m going to admit here, this isn’t their best asset for the game, it’s not ultra-realistic, even though it is pretty close. However, if these guys have made Chariot Wars as good looking to most other megaton releases, then not only is OM Entertainment talented, I ask the other developers out there, how in the hell do you get away with spending so much money on new graphical technology, when there is barely any difference from your last game release?  Ok, onto the gameplay. There is a rush of adrenaline when each race starts, you’ll want to ram and make your opponents crash, while you race onwards. The sense of speed and danger of your opponents possibly catching up behind you will have you on the edge of your seat, trying to keep ahead and control of your chariot. Honestly, it’s really hard to put this into words, so I’ll simply say, it’s just amazing.  We also can’t forget about the variety in locations and everything else. You can select multiple characters, and multiple different chariots with nice highly detailed designs to make yourself look more intimidating to your competition. You can get an extra advantage over others if you choose the right type of horse depending on the map, which leads it into more of a thinking game of what to choose to out-do your opponents. Hats off to the developers for bringing some depth and variety to the selection process before each race including the nice selection of maps to choose from.   Speaking of the maps it’s nice to see highly detailed locations in Ancient Greece Egypt, and Gaul. You’ll actually spot some nice landmarks on some of the maps so you’ll know fairly quickly, where you are if you’re a history and geography fanatic like I am.  Really looking forward to the Multiplayer update, I’ll update this when it’s in the game to talk about it!  I can’t recommend this game enough, people need to play it and experience it for themselves. YouTube videos, or broadcasts from Steam, Twitch or YouTube don’t do this game justice, you REALLY need to play it to get the real sense of dynamic rich content there is in this little gem of a game. We need to support more developers like this that are brave and bold enough to still release quality releases like this that are truly unique and not afraid to try something new.",
