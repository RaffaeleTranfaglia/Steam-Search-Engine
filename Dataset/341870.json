            "review_text": "Tembo the Badass Elephant is a difficult platformer made by Japanese studio Game Freak (you may know them because of Pokémon RPG series) and published by SEGA. That shows a big promise, considering also the price of 13 euros, right?  Well, on the first look, the game have gorgeous visual style with comic features (typical comic interjections) that is pointed towards comedy - I mean even the game name suggests you can't take it much seriously, as your character is an army elephant who... is absolutely badass. (He could be the next Expendable!)  Difficulty of the game is high, you can't pick anything like casual difficulty there, so prepare to die (as Dark Souls taught me). But don't worry, it's not that hardcore, expect having few checkpoints and 5 lives per level (if you lose them, you just lose progress in specific stage).   Difficulty is also set high because of the unique movement of the elephant. As the elephant is heavier than average platformer character, your movement will be mostly horizontally wide but vertically short. Also, for attacks you can use only melee attacks (thanks to jumping and charging) but there's one more utility thing - you can splash water with your trunk. That's useful against fire attacks, which you will see against you pretty often.  Length of the game could be definitely higher, I've beaten all levels in 5 hours, considering I've been stuck for about 45 minutes at the final boss. The game offers 14 levels (and 4 bossfights) split into 4 locations. Worth mentioning is the third location, the amusement park. It just brings back the horror from Sonic 3's circus stage - but don't worry, only visually!  As you check negative reviews and discussion, you can see many posts about bugs and bad performance. I've played the game on four years old low-end laptop and had no problem getting 60 FPS. For the bugs, I've found the one that made many people uninstall the game - I couldn't move and when I jumped, I just got shot to the stars (into the place where even textures don't exist). But this was solved only with restarting the game, then it was okay. It surprises me what can happen with 'another platformer made in Unity engine', totally didn't expect that. One more thing, which I found half-baked, is the restart level function - it takes you a life! So... instead of restarting, you can just die, it's the same.   Conclusion:",

            "review_text": "So here's Trumbo (Tembo The Badass Elephant), a platforming, dash-holding simulator. With some minor launch issues that got the pre-purchasers as well as the 'let me watch these forums like a ♥♥♥♥ing hawk!' people who didn't even try the demo, SEGA turned things around, like they always do, and helped bring Trumbo to a smooth, settling release.   Yeah, the game's amazing. Just an elephant simulating, water shooting, fat-♥♥♥ ground-pounding, purple dude ripping platformer with some actual, decent level design. Each area is unique in its own way and really well thought out. The civilians-to-be-saved are well hidden, but Game Freak kept Trumbo to a safe, 'here's a clearly breakable wall that you would have only missed due to some 2.5D angling and stuff.'  The music is catchy, but not really memorable save for the opening theme. The cutscenes are comic-styled and goofy. The bosses are classic, Japanese rehashes, but actually quite enjoyable with the whole slow-mechanics-in-small-rooms thing Trumbo has going for it.  My only big gripe is the level design in the final, final, final area gets super lazy and super sketchy. A lot of stuff is absolute BS, but it's whatever, since you're still a rampaging elephant trying to save some caged bros.  I rate this an 8.75/10. Solid as ♥♥♥♥.",

Pros:  + visuals are great and look beautiful + gameplay is unique and fun + controller support + soundtrack is nice and fitting + very creative bossfights + clever leveldesign  Cons:  - secrets are way too hidden, you have to just guess and take leap of faiths - controls do not feel fluent like they should. Its kinda jerky at times - game difficulty ramps up too fast and the game gets frustrating - collectibles and secrets are only there for achievments..... - the game is kinda short at 4 hours with multiple attempts on some of the levels and bosses  Its a cute little game that you can play from time to time, when you dont wanna have a lenghty or story-focused game session. Its worth checking out in a sale.",

I can't configure my controller, because the configuring screen won't accept the imput for my controller, and after I tried and failed that. I thought well maybe it is some use just using my keyboard, and when I tried to confingure the keyboard to be more comfortable to me. I couldn't do that either (all I wanted was to take a function joystick 8 and change it into a usable key on my keyboard, but it won't budge). There needs to be a serious update so that I can use my controller, or atleast gain the ability to change the key to function on my computer keyboard. Highly disappointed in this game, and steam for not addressing the game companies to slap the label full controler support when it is more like half controller support, or slight controller support, becuase that's what it really is.",
