            "review_text": "There comes a point in trying to be funny through irony, that you completely pass over any comedic potential, and become the thing you are trying to emulate.  For example, people who say 'Dank' and act like they don't like internet memes.   I have plenty of time clocked in on this game offline, it is not a good game.",

            "review_text": "Candice Debebe's Incredibly Trick Lifestyle is a quirky game with a weird plot, even weirder characters, and a soundtrack that has to be heard to be believed. It's a game that at first glance looks like a poorly made rushed project that was hastily put on Steam to try to make a quick buck, but it actually had a lot of work put into it, despite it's shoddy appearance. It's a silly yet charming game, and if you're into silly joke games like I am, I say you should check it out. A few words of advice though on some improvements that could be made:  1. Add a run function so Candice can move a bit faster. 2. Add a map for Digital Hex or at least make it a bit easier to navigate. That was probably one of the most tedious parts that i came across and can be off putting since it's pretty early in the game. 3. Invest in a pop shield for your microphone. 4. There's a 'bug' where you can use the boat to climb over the guard and get on the Lusty Mermaid before completing the necessary steps which should probably be fixed. 5. The price is a bit high to be honest, and I would definitely recommend the game 100% if it was at a lower price, but I'm not sure how much power the creator has over setting the price.  Overall, although it may look like Steam shovelware at first glance, the game is much more than that. It's not just an asset flip. It has original models, an original plot, and a soundtrack that although the singing may be not top notch, the music itself is actually well composed and the pianist definitely knows their way around a piano. Is it stupid? Yes. Should it be on Steam? Probably not. But for all its ridiculousness its amusing and you can't help but have at least a little bit of respect for the developer putting the amount of effort they did into this wacky RPG. I recommend this game if you are into silly joke games as this one has a lot of charm.",
