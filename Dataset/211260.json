The game features brilliant art and soundtrack, Movement and controllability are quite fantastic, although there might be a few issues regarding controller support and adjusting to the character movement (especially wall jumps) might take some time.  The difficulty ramps up really quickly, you will die hundreds of times and some stages can take well more than an hour to finish during first playtrhough, certainly if you want to kill every monster, collect all the hidden pages or obtain a high rank by collecting as much blood as possible. I haven't tried the novice difficulty setting, but I imagine it's not quite for a casual player either.  All in all the game is very well polished, background music drives you to try harder even when you feel like quitting.. And the violence.. oh, all the ways to dismantle your enemies and make them pay for BLOCKING YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ PATH AGAIN in excitingly innovative and brutal ways.. really helps relief stress you may have acquired while playing.

            "review_text": "They Bleed Pixels is a 2-D sprite based platformer combat hybrid, it offers a variety of well designed levels and indie style music from DJ Finish Him. While this game is well made, a good port on PC, and has controller support, I will say its definitely not for everyone, because of one factor.  The Difficulty  This is one of the most difficult platformers I've ever played, and it isn't for reasons you'd expect. For one unlike other notoriously hard platformers, you are given a wide variety of abilities, such as a dash, double jump, wall jump, and a plenty of combat moves to work with against enemies. You also get a system that replaces lives and continues with your own checkpoint at any point of the level when a certain score is reached by defeating enemies and collecting items. However, the levels don't get truly challenging until you hit the 3rd world, which is referred to as dreams in this game.   'THEN HOW COULD THIS GAME POSSIBLY BE HARD!?' You scream at me  Well the enemies are designed to be aggressive, all of them, even tiny squids are your worst enemy as the level design shows you more saws in one area then at your local hardware store. Because there is a heavy hitting knock-back similar to that of the Castlevania games on NES, you'll more likely die from hitting one cleverly placed saw or enemy, because there is no recovery time in the game you could lose all 3 of your hearts in less than a second.  All in all, this was a great game to play, and an amazingly designed one at that with a cool style and music, I'd recommend it, but to actually finish it is a question you can only answer by your skill level.  Also you play as a little girl, so that's cool.",

            "review_text": "They Bleed Pixels feels like a mix of Super Meat Boy and Battletoads, a tough-as-nails trap-infested 2D platformer that will test both your reflexes and your sanity. Individual levels are lengthy and well-designed, with a unique checkpoint system helping lessen some of the frustration of dying in tough spots. There's also a somewhat clunky combat system that comes across as a bit obtuse early on but gets better with use. Controls are mostly tight and responsive as they should be in this type of game, however at times it feels as though there's a slight yet noticeable input delay when it comes to jumping. It's something I eventually adapted to and didn't notice at all after playing for a long stretch, but it was a nuisance early on. The game also features a quirky gothic aesthetic style and Lovecraft-influenced story, as well as a surprisingly fantastic soundtrack.  If you aren't a fan of difficult 2D platformers that are capable of pushing your patience, it's probably best to pass on They Bleed Pixels. But if you don't mind a rewarding challenge that provides both pleasure and pain, it's worth giving a shot.",

They Bleed Pixels is, first and foremost, a platformer. One that is very difficult by the end. Unlike many platformers, combat is integral to this game, and while the one button system is simple compared to a Metroidvania or action game it is intuitive and enjoyable. The game has a good blend of combat and platforming. Enemies are sometimes used as obstacles more than opponents, acting as a barrier that you must bypass to escape an oncoming wall of death, other times they might be stress toys more than anything else (kicking a shambler into a sawblade is VERY satisfying). The scenery, music, and atmosphere are all extremely good. The stages are dark and spooky, and each has its own architectural theme, making them visually distinct.  This is a great game available at a great price. I highly recommend it.",

            "review_text": "I wanted this game for a long time because I liked its style and presentation. When it went on sale I eargly grabbed it and...was just so disappointed. I was looking forward to a challenging plat-former with an interesting visual style. Well I certainly got something 'Challenging' but for all the wrong reasons. The game is artificialy difficult. The whole thing is basically like those Super Mario hacks where the game is almost impossibly hard because the person put a lot of effort into making sure you get screwed over at every turn. I couldn't tell you how many times I died because something popped out at the last second from hiding, and would demand the reflexes of a coked up 8 year old to dodge on the first try. Which bassicaly turns large portions of the game into less of a plat-former and more of a memorization puzzle with the added difficulty of having to jump around.   The game employs a unique check point system, when you have absorbed enough blood you are allowed to drop down a check point which heals you and allows you to continue from that sport if you die. The only limiting factors are that you can't be moving, and can't be near a saw blade or an enemy. And because of those two factors a good portion of the time these check points were useless because the developers would place a random saw blade, or cover EVERYTHING in slippery goo to make sure you can't actually stop moving and drop a check point. Forcing you to do large portions of a level without being able to employ a system the developers put in. In some cases I wondered why the check point system existed because 80% of the level was created so I couldn't drop a check point at all. It's pretty frustrating to have that purple glow around you indicating you could place down a check point and take a breather, only to notice that there is NO where to drop it down.   Jumping is a big problem. Under normal circumstance the jump and double jump work fine but when you attempt to double jump off a wall, if you do it wrong, the double jump fails. As far as I can tell its a timing issue, you need to cling to the wall for the right period of time to be able to jump off it an then perform a second jump. It's only a fraction of a second difference between getting your double jump and not. Normally this isn’t a big deal but it you're getting into a groove, or you NEED to be fast to get past a part this becomes a huge problem. It turns some parts of the game into an annoying game of timing the wall jumps juuuuuuuust right so you're still moving quickly, but cling to the wall long enough to perform the second jump you need.   Combat can be fun at times; kicking an enemy into a saw blade is immensely satisfying. However this part of the game also is greatly flawed. the developers like to throw lots of flying enemies at you while you're performing difficult jumps. Which make sense in a game with combat, only they don’t give you any way to dispatch these enemies, forcing you to try and complete already difficult platforming while also dodign enemy attacks. Usually I had to get part way through a tricky jump situation, then double back so I could dispatch the flying enemy who followed me. It made difficult jumps tedious and frustrating. As for normal combat, everything gets the kick. Really, there isn't much more complexity to the game than that. Kick an enemy into a trap or kick them into the air and air juggle them. That's as complex as the game gets. Even when fighting multiple enemies just kick them all into a corner, kick them all into the air, and air juggle them all. At first combat was fun but after a while the lack of variety became really boring. Most of the time if I didn’t need a check point I avoided combat because despite how easy it can be sometimes to dispatch enemies, other times its really hard because of the broken controls.  The game has no invisibility frames so its not only possible you can get killed in a few seconds by one enemy who got in a bunch of hits or a trap you bumped into, its a guarantee its going to happen. And the knock back from taking damage is ridiculous. Its not so bad for enemies, but for traps it makes no sense and is extremely frustrating. If you land on spikes you jump up and way from them by about 3 pixels, meaning you will die on those spikes because the odds of being able to jump away are slim. Its pretty pathetic dying on a single set of spikes because being damaged by them doesn throw you far enough away from them to actually do anything about it. Saw blades are the total opposite, one of those babies touches you you go FLYING! and its pretty much a guarantee that if the blade doesn’t kill you, where ever it sends you will.   The game is challenging, yes, but because of bad design. The entire game is just a test of how perfect you are able to play the game, because yes, you HAVE to be perfect in what you do for many parts of the game. No room for error, or creativity. You have to do it exactly as the developer intended. It makes for a frustrating and boring experience. I’m glad I got it on sale and didn't waste more money on it.",

            "review_text": "This game is a good example of why difficulty for it's own sake is not a positive. This game is made difficult by... A.) A character with little weight and poor traction B.) Checkpoint starvation disguised with a place-your-own-checkpoint system. The game allows you to place your own checkpoints, but only in places with non-icy, non-buzzsaw-infested ground. Instead of directly starving you for checkpoints, the game instead starves you for clear ground upon which to place said checkpoints. C.) A difficult obstacle, which is then duplicated five times before you reach a place where you can set a checkpoint. Doing the difficult obstacle once is clearly not difficult enough, so you must do it five times in a row instead, with very little variation besides adding more buzzsaws. D.) Oversaturation of spikes, buzzsaws, and icy ground. Even in the inferno level there is ice to prevent you from walljumping or having any fun. Difficulty that relies on depriving the player of options and control over the character is not enjoyable.  6 out of 10  Overall, the level design is unimaginative and unnecessarily irritating. I've played and enjoyed a lot of difficult platformers, but this one is not difficult for the right reasons.  Sidenote: The music is literally nauseating.

            "review_text": "They Bleed Pixels is a very difficult platformer with mediocre combat and no charm to its name.  I really think that's the problem I have with TBP - a lack of charm. The enemies are shapeless black blobs. Combat is simply not fun. All the levels are completely empty except for platforms, enemies, and spikes. I don't know if just one person made this game, but it definitely feels that way.   I think that I, personally, have reached a point in my life where I need some fluff with my crunch - some reason to keep playing a game beyond a testosterone-driven desire to win for the sake of winning. They Bleed Pixels offers nothing but additional soulless, empty levels as a reward for your constant deaths.  This may not be the case for you, and if so, godspeed, you horrible human being.",
