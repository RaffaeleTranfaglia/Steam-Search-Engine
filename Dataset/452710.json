While the areas need more examples of the guided tour audio and photos to interact with, the application is very immersive and their models are amazingly detailed. I'm hoping the platform is open so more groups like national parks or museums can map, model, and upload their own local scenes for folks to visit.",

I don't understand why people would compare this to The Lab, just because it's free. It's a completely different beast, not the same category at all.  Anyway, I enjoyed it. I've never heard of these places before and when I found my first leaflet it was really enjoyable for me. Great work guys!  Oh and I guess there was some tutorial guy the first time I loaded it, but I jumped into a place too quick and just heard the greeting... made me scared that this would be 'multiplayer' and I'd blink around with other people discussing things. The guy on top of that castle didn't help! :D",

The 3D world and textures doesn't exactly seem to be in very high definition, despite the 12GB footprint, but it has a nice voiceover explaining what you look at using both voice, 2D still-images, text reacting depending on your orientation etc.  Not that much to see yet but cool nonetheless.",

See the 'postcards' section in Valve's 'the lab' for a better free environment simulator. Or use wikipedia and google maps to see more varied environments with more comfortable access to more information.",

I entered Burgruine Hohenrechberg castle, walked up to the first panphlet, listened to a description of the surrounding area, and was overwhelmed by the implications this would have on VR Education. I had to sit down and relax due to my mind racing. This is just the beginning.",
