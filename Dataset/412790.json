It'll probably take around 30-40 minutes to complete and in that time you'll get an experience that's pretty much just like a regular Adventure Time episode. Finn, Jake, LSP and Magic Man all make an appearence with wonderfully crafted character models and the same voice talent from the show. The humour is on point and the world looks just great.  Works great with a Steam Controller.  The only negatives are the achievements currently don't work, and the length, I definitely want to play more levels, but for the price it's not a swindle.  Would definitely recommend.",

            "review_text": "Like the show, is bite sized and leaves you wanting more.  Be warned before you buy, this game is only two levels, and you'll probably be done in a sitting. But with the $5 price tag, I was happy with the enjoyment I got. I prefered this to any other Adventure Time game I've played so far, as the padding always dragged me down. It gives you the jokes it has and lets you enjoy what it has without stretching the game longer than it should. However, if you have limited funds and need to maximize your game time, this might not be for you.",

            "review_text": "Pros:  Easy, seated VR experience played from a 'giant's' perspective.  Adventure Time fans will appreciate the character interactions (they talk TO you) Controls well and feels like a polished platformer Cheap price.  Cons: Way, way, way too short. Story (what little there is) ends abruptly. Price is reflective of the amount of content. Magic Man doesn't actually play games with your head. I was expecting more tomfoolery from this.  I'd only recommend this for diehard fans of Adventure Time and for kids. I imagine it would be a decent way to get them to sit still for 30-40 minutes.",

            "review_text": "It's not: motion-controlled, room-scale, long, or challenging.  What it is: absolutely delicious VR platforming. Lucky's Tale honestly has nothing on this (LT's camera movements actually made me feel a little ill; this doesn't.) The environments are delightful to be in and look at, the characters (having the benefit of being established and really well done here) are engaging, there are clever touches for the VR perspective. And it's just a really sharply made platformer. It makes me sad that it's not longer; they could easily have gone back and added another dozen levels.  Sorry for the Lucky's Tale comparisons (I only tried it yesterday with Revive so it's fresh in my mind), but even though they're equally easy, I found this to be much more nuanced in its control and level design. It's not saying a whole lot when it's only two levels, but what I'm trying to say is it's really high quality stuff. It makes me wish they had made a much longer game, cause what's here is really good.",

            "review_text": "I went in to this knowing that it would be around half an hour of content and I must say that I enjoyed what was given to me since the price dropped, it's basically an ordinary Adventure Time episode worth of gameplay. But as I said it's half an hour, you get through it in one sitting and you feel satisfied in the end, but at the end of the day you still end up wanting more as this does feel more like a tech demo rather than a full game - but for the new price they charge it's well worth the money if you like anything Adventure Time.  However I do wish that they'll get back to this type of game in the future cause it was quite fun but as stated, felt like a tech demo rather than a game. Maybe the next game could be episodic, where they release similar to this half an hour of content for each episode and make maybe a whole season worth of episodes (12-24 episodes).",
