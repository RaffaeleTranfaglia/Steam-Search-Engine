It's a fast paced arcade type of game that takes place inside a particle accelerator and you will have to go through obstacles to pass the test.  I'm not going to go into many details, but The Collider is a fast paced game, and I mean a very fast paced game. The levels will progressively get harder and you will accelerate faster and faster towards the obstacles, giving you less time to maneuver them and will challenge your reflex skills.  The controls are very simple, you just use your mouse to move the particle around and avoid the obstacles. It also has some controller support so that is a plus.  The achievements can be easy to get, you'll most likely get them all within an hour or so. The leaderboard is also a very nice feature to have, you can try to beat your friends' score and it gives you a purpose to keep going further than usual. The music is really decent as you play it, I like it. :)  And let's not forget about the trading cards. ;)  All in all, it is enjoyable and yet, challenging at the same time. You won't get very far at first, but you know what they say: 'Practice makes perfect.'    Should you buy this game?",

            "review_text": "The Collider, developed by Shortbreak Studios, offers the chance to test the reflexes, and how long one can go without blinking in a fast paced 'thread the needle' type game. A simple concept, to be sure, so how does the game ultimately fare?There is little to say about The Collider, as it isn't so much a typical game, as it is a mild distraction to stave off boredom. Basically, the aim of the game is to thread a white dot, representing the cursor of the mouse, through circular panels that have small openings, some with coins, and some without. Crash and it is a loss of life; crash enough times and it's Game Over. It is possible to continue from crashing via spending the coins that are collected.That's really all there is to it.The main thing to keep the game going is the incremental increases in speed. At first it is pedestrian, but later on, the game whizzes along at such a speed that any form of blinking will result in a crash and Game Over.Essentially, anyone with experience in staring contests and with good reflexes should be able to have plenty of fun with the game. That's really all there is to it, though.Colourful and joyous, there's not really any graphics to speak of, but the courses are a wonderful kaleidoscope of colours. The soundtrack is rather basic with a whooshing sound as the thread goes through the needles.The Collider is a solid game that sets out what it wants to do: get the player jumping through hoops at ridiculous speeds. That is all it offers, though; there isn't enough here to justify a score higher than 5/10.",

It is very simple and easy to control, but is incredibly fast paced, very challenging and very fun, it's also another of those games with a great soundtrack.  This game will test your reflexes and reaction speed to the limit, it is very short but very quick giving you very little time to make your moves the further you progress into the game.  There have been some complaints in the reviews and community hub regarding the achievements, in my case, they work(ed) fine, but I had to restart the game in order for them to take effect.   There isn't much else to say about this game that isn't already clear on the store page, what you see in the trailer is what you get. Think fast, move fast, and work your way up the leader board.  The Collider  often goes on sale for a very low price (£0.67 when I purchased it) so don't miss it if it does, it's definitely worth the money.",

            "review_text": "The Collider is an exhilerating Indie title in which you navigate through a tunnel at an increasing speed while trying to make it through the same type of obstacle -- the infamous rotating vertical disc with a hole in it. Spooky.  If you played Rayman 3: Hoodlum Havoc and partook in the Missile Command minigame, this should feel familiar to you. You're essentially guiding a camera through a series of conveniently placed rotating discs with holes in them. The holes differ in size and shape, which I find to be challenging yet rewarding. As time progresses, the speed at which you're zooming by increases exponentially with each interval (every time the counter reaches 100, to be exact). If you're appreciative of pretty colors, you're in for quite the treat here -- there are a  lot  of them.  The soundtrack in the game is an upbeat electronic motivator. It makes the entire experience a bit more exciting, though it does get old as you continue playing. Hearing the same song over and over again typically doesn't bode well if it doesn't resonate with its listener, surprisingly enough. Still, though -- it's a tune I certainly wanted to dance to at one point.  If you're looking for a euphoric graphical experience, you've come to the wrong place. You can see for yourself in the screenshots provided on the game's store page.  The only indication that you're finished with the game would have to be the achievements. I'm not too keen on my champion status (the game includes a leaderboard), and as such, the game is finished for me once I've acquired all of the achievements available for me to earn.  The only issue I've found within the game is that at a certain point, your crosshair is simply too large. I often found myself struggling to see where the hole was because of it. It's easily remedied by proper peripheral vision, though.  Definitely worth the price. I bought it while it was on sale for a few cents, I'd advise you to do the same.  Oh, and don't blink.",

The game gets a tad repetive but every course is different, none are the same, there are weekly 'objectives' or something like that, forgot what it was called. A global leader board (I'm thirteenth player c:) other than that it seems to be worth it, it is an amazing game and has some amazing gameplay, definently would recommend you guys to buy this. 10/10 for sure.",

I, when the achievements unlocked for me, unlocked all of them...easily...in one sitting...in 2 MINUTES!!!!!! If you have look at how long I have played this game [1.8 hours], it took a fraction of that time for me to unlock EVERYTHING!!! And no, the 1.8 hours wasn't from just leaving the game on, it was from playing the game, pure and simple. And sure, there isn't much to do, but holy ♥♥♥♥, it was super disappointing to unlock the achievements.   I, before unlocking the achievements, played The Collider for the leaderboard, and also got the app for my iPhone to see what was easier. Both, in the end, were very disappointing for me and left me with a few minutes of entertainment/frustration (more of the latter).  In the end, do not buy this game. Sure, all of the achievements are easy to unlock, but the game, overall, is NOT WORTH IT. PERIOD.",

The graphics were like that of a free to play flash game you would find on the internet. I regret that I didn't read the reviews before I got this, it shouldn't cost 3 ♥♥♥♥in' dollars. hell, it should be free! You see all these positive reviews saying that it can improve your reflexes in FPS games, that's just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Too ashamed to admit that they actually spent money on this peice of crap, they decide to give it a good excuse:' It helps your concentration as well as a bit of mouse control.'   It's just like that part in 'The adventures of Huckleberry Finn' where the frauds 'King' and 'Duke' put up a fake show and the townspeople who were tricked by it decide to lure more people to watch it instead of exposing the fraud show, because they were afraid of being laughed at; and then everyone in town went and all stepped on the same boat: being swindled by the frauds to their show.

(not saying there aren't people who like to just add achievements to their steam list) -after the first 2 to 4 minutes, you've seen the entire game, no reason to replay it after getting all the cards, even other mobile endless runners have more content than this, and for free. -cards take far too long to come out for what the game really is, for example. i felt like i was done with the game after 20 or 30 minutes of play...and i was, in fact the only reason i have 2 hours+ of play is because that's what it took me to get all of my card drops so in reality, i only played half an hour, even if i were to replay i don't think i'd play over an hour of this game before uninstalling. ultimately having steam trading cards as one of the biggest reasons to get a game is still objectively bad game design and marketing. want proof? the only reason i realised i had this game on my library was because i was browsing my uninstalled games list. after the cards drop, there's no reason to come back, you are done.",
