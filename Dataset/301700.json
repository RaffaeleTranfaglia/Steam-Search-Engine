            "review_text": "Numba Deluxe is a casual puzzle game in which you highlight groups of number by type (eg. 1 1 1 1), order (1 2 3 4), addition (1 3 5 7) or multiplication (1 2 4 8), causing them to disappear and numbers from above to fall. There are three modes: Classic, Timeless, and Puzzle. I bought this for the puzzle mode, in which I've spent about 95% of my playing time, so that's what I'm reviewing.  This is very much a game of what you see is what you get: watch the video on the store page and you'll know whether this is your type of game or not. That might be kind of lazy of me to say in a review, but it's true ;) Visuals are clean but unspectacular, music is cheery but non-descript--there are no bells and whistles here. The same background is used throughout all the menus/games, the same sound effect is used every.single.time. you clear blocks (and you will hear it a LOT).  That said, is the gameplay itself solid? I would say so. The puzzles, in which you must clear all the blocks from the level, are generally on the easy side so far (I'm at level 60-something out of 84, in about 1.5 hours), but once in a while there's some curveballs thrown your way via different block types to keep it varied. (eg. a fire block needs to fall on an ice block to melt it).  However, so far it's a good thing that levels are easy, because the puzzles appear sequentially, and there's no way to skip to a different puzzle without solving the one you're on. The scoring system seems rather pointless as well, as every time you restart the game you begin at 0, and there's no score recorded for individual puzzles, so the highscore table is really just a matter of how long you played rather than how well/fast you solved the puzzles (there's also no timer, btw).  On a technical note, there are no resolution options.  I realize I'm sounding rather negative, but that's only because I'm mentioning things that are small annoyances. The positives are all in the video: it's a simple, straightforward game that can be easily picked up and sometimes makes you put on your thinking cap. I have no regrets about my $3.",

It's kinda like a match 3+ where you group numbers in different chains, like consecutive(12345), all the same(55555), odds(135), evens(246), and more that I haven't found yet. I reconmend it to anyone looking for a casual puzzle game.",

            "review_text": "Numba Deluxe is a puzzle game from 2013. The puzzles are made of numbers and you have to solve them in a specific direction. For example, there are number combinations like '12345', '11111' or '13579' etc. And in fact, that's the whole game basis. If you get how the number combinations are working, you have found out the game principles.  To make the game playable for a longer time period, there are 3 game mods you can choose: classic, timeless, and puzzle. In the classic game mod you have to play level by level. There is a clock bar going down and you have to finish the level before the time is over. From level to level it's going to be harder. The second game mod is the timeless mod. Here you can play the game without any time pressure infinitely. The last game mod is the puzzle mod. In the puzzle mod you have 84 levels to solve.  If you like puzzle games, may you will like it, because it really makes fun to solve the riddles. Unfortunately, the classic and the timeless mod are going relatively fast boring. So, after a short time, you don't want to play anymore. The puzzle mod is intresting for a longer time period. But after 2-3 hours you have also finished the 84 levels.  All in one, the game isn't really bad for puzzle fans, but there are some shortcomings. The game isn't available in HD, which is really bad for a 2013 release. So you have to play with lower resolution. When you have finished the puzzle mod and you played some classic and timeless mod, it's getting really boring. So you can't play this game for a longer time period. There are also no Steam tradingcards or achievements.  This game was also released as a mobile phone game, and that's the place for it. It is certainly better suited to play it with touchscreen on the phone than on the PC. Even if it isn't a bad game, there are 1000 other games like this you can find for PC and phone for free. Therefore, I can't recommend this game. If you like to play a puzzle game with numbers, search the Google Play Store / Apple Store or search the internet for online browser games. You don't have to buy this.   Summary  +nice puzzles +challenging level +nice way of passing the time a little bit -no HD, low resolution -standard graphics -no real game options -short playtime until you've solved the puzzle mod -gets boring fast",
