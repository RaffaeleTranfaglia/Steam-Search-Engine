            "review_text": "The most generic RPG-RTS you will ever play, also one of the best.  It's an RPG/RTS that lets you carry hero stats over from game-to-game, it also has an expansive open RPG style single player campaign that's a lot of fun, it also has a hardcore mode for heroes that includes perma-death.  Units also gain EXP and levels, and what's really cool is your heroes get to carry over some units at the end of each game if you'd like, so on top of game-to-game hero stats you also get to try and hold on to a group of elite units that you try to foster into high level killing machines, as long as they don't die.  I grew up playing this game, and graphically, mechanically, it's nothing special, but the sheer BULK of units, races, heroes, and fun is enough to make this game worth every penny you will spend on it.  I'm getting some thumbs down so maybe I'm not being clear enough. This is a very good RTS-RPG on all levels with a huge amount of content, but it is simply very generic in its theme, that's all.  It's not even generic in a bad way, it just has all the classic units and races you'd expect or want.  The weakest part of the game overall is probably the graphics which were not that great when it came out in the first place, some units also feel a bit out of place graphically when you take the art themes into account, sort of like when units are added with a mod and they don't look like the same person made them.  Oh, and it would be best if you didn't buy this for the MP, I'm not sure what sort of hoops you're going to need to jump through to get it working.",

            "review_text": "Get the Protectors mod. The game's source has been released for free some time ago. The mod is better. The balance on Steam is just ridiculously not funny on Single Player. Doesn't have updated resolution support either. The mod is: 1) FREE and Standalone 2) Has full HD resolution support (1920x1080) 3) Actually balanced for fun, with a lot of additions and changes 4) Offers additional campaign and scenarios (on top of the old ones)  SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND TO PLAY THIS AWESOME GAME! Just be aware that the Steam release is so... so limited and - for my liking - broken.  I was not into mods for this game, but I got so annoying with it that I gave it a go and I am glad that I did!",

Love that you can bring your own entourage from fight to fight (as long as they don't die haha) Enjoy the campaign and can't wait to play with more friends. Highly recomend for anyone who enjoys fantasy RTS and character building.",

I play through it so I only got the game to support it and to leave this review. You dont need to get it from steam but you really should play it, its amazing.",

At the time, I was certain that the future of RTS gaming would change... sadly, this is one of the few great RPG RTS games out there.   You actually aquire and level characters that persist into the next map... so long as they survive... and side quests on the map as well.   I highly recommend this game, especially if you are an RTS fan.  Unfortunately, the only thing I have against it are the low rez graphics, due to the dated nature of the game. They appear blurry at 1024x768. I have a feeling they will probably release an HD version at some point... or Hope.",

Unfortunately, when I bought, downloaded, and ran the game, I learned that Skirmish mode (you vs AI) doesn't work at all, and saving games and heroes is also impossible making the game itself completely worthless. Even worse, I spent all day yesterday playing through the campaign only to save my game, and come back to nothing. 16.ish hours right down the drain. I'm requesting a refund.",
