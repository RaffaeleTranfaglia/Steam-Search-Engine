            "review_text": "The goal of this game is very simple - in every level you need to move a ball to the exit through a maze without touching the edges of the maze and avoiding all other obstacles. There is a time requirement for every level - you get 1 - 3 stars per level according to your time performance; these stars are needed for unlocking all the levels.  This is considered to be one of the games in which you can obtain 100% achievements very easy – some do it in 30 minutes – 1 hour. For me, the experience of obtaining 100% was a quite frustrating because I had to retry each level several times and push myself to do it faster and faster to the point in which my wrist started to hurt like hell. Depending on your mouse type and mouse grip or maybe depending on your coordination skills and quick reactions that have been trained or not by extensive session of FPS – this might be a fun game for you or not.  Despite this, I decided to give this game a positive review – I enjoyed the concept but I think that the required times might be a bit too strict - it's that kind of game in which 1 millisecond counts a lot. I also liked a lot the extra Christmas levels, which had innovative ideas and were very fun to play.   More reviews on the  Lilly's Corner Curator page  ",

            "review_text": "At the price that it is originally posted as, $4.99, this game is definitely not recommended. However, I did pick this up for $0.49 at 90% off and at that price this game is a good game. The basic concept is that you click on a ball and walk it through a maze or an obstacle course. If you touch a wall or any other object other than the exit, you will start the level over. There are 40 levels and the types of obstacles from standard walls to ghosts to lasers to bouncing balls changes as the game progresses. The graphics are not anything spectacular, but then again the game doesn't require them to be. The game is really short and easy to complete, but yet you will go through your frustrations as the sensitivity of the mouse can easily slam you into walls again and again and again. Overall, if the price is as low as the one I got it for, then I recommend it since there is no other game like it that I'm aware of on Steam.",

Only minus is the length of the game and that's why game is definitely not worth 5€. I still want to recommend this game if you get it for 1€ or less.",
