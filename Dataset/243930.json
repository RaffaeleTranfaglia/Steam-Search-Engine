            "review_text": "Bound by Lies,   I had high hopes for this game. Me and a friend of mine saw it pop up on steam a while ago and pre ordered it.   **SPOILERS**  The review will have some plot points as its one of the many issues with this game.  We were so disapointed, il let him make a review if he wants so I will tell it all from my perspective. The trailers have lied, the combat isnt adaptable or planned etc. Its broken. As a Warrior I found it boring and repetative, then with some enemies having the ability to not be stunned or blocked you come across enemies that chain stun you in a corner and kill you. Over and over. But I got over that, I carried on playing and found plenty of other flaws.  The ability of choise is an illusion, there are basically 2 options, become a demon and kill everyone you care about or stay good and I can assume not kill everyone. I became a demon and after that the game was basically set in stone. I had the odd decision to make, weather its to kill 1 boss and let others be killed or help in a battle. But it dosent seem to matter, the game is on rails and basically makes the decision for you and you companion is now screwed over, runs off and vows revenge. Which he tries to get but fails miserably, you dont even have the option to try and talk people down like in Mass Effect or get told the 'Good' or 'Bad' options, you get streamlined down a boring story that makes no sense. The characters are not likeable at all, you dont really care about who lives or dies, I just found myself frustrated that I couldnt prevent mit if I decided.  They also said that the classes are different and theres different ways to play the game, the only tallent tree I didnt fill was the Rogue tree and that was because it was pointless. II filled the warrior tree and used all of its 4 abities that were generic and boring, I had the Pyromancy tree half done so I gave my weapon flames and that was about it really.   From what I could see and heard from my friend Pyromancy is just throwing fireballs running out of Mana then giving your weapon fire and going into melee to be diisapointed as you suck in melee but have no other choise. I dont really have much more to say on this since I didnt play it to its full extent.   One positive of this game is that its incredibly pretty, they have done a fantastic job with the graphics and the design of the weapons and armor is great, you really do feel like a badass when you upgrade your gear through a very simple yet effective crafting system. Thats a couple of positives but you get the idea.  In summary, dont buy the game now. Its a badly thought out poor quality rpg that forces you to make decisions that in the end dont matter, get it when its on sale. I finished the game in 13 hours and for £25 I was upset about this. Id say its worth £10 max. My friend playing Pyro finished it in 7. I dont knkow if its me sucking taking that long or Pyros just easier.  Hope this was Helpful.",

            "review_text": "I can definitely see 'The Witcher' influence in 'Bound By Flame'; if only they had taken more points from that game's design.  'Bound By Flame' is not fun, period. The combat feels clunky and I often find myself unable to execute an action because my character has not finished the animation from the previous attack. This makes it feel as though my character is drunk and unable to react quickly, The devs advertise 'strategic combat' but it just ends up being button mashing. The counter/parry system is basic, nothing new.  The graphics are quite good, with environments and NPCs being highly detailed. Animations however, particularly facial ones are quite stiff and jittery. The lip syncing is very poor, often with characters' mouth animations stopping mid sentence or finishing before the audio. At one point, while I was in a conversation with a character an NPC was spawned about 2 metres away from where I was. It was very noticable as he just appeared in mid-air and fell to the ground where he proceeded to stand and perform his normal animations. Fortunately this has only happened once, but it greatly detracted from the immersion.  The voice acting is average, however I was not pleased to hear modern American colloquialisms such as 'I got' instead of 'I've got' in some of the characters' sentences.  The story itself is fairly interesting, however it is nothing we haven't seen before and it is not enough to make up for the other problems this game has.  I am maybe being too harsh on this game as 'Spiders' are a small studio, but I have to give an honest recount of my experience with this game. In short, I   do not   recommend 'Bound By Flame'.",

            "review_text": "I really tried to like this game but for some reason it just doesn't grow on me.  Warrior and Pyromancer Skilltrees are completely useless against Bosses making the whole concept of the story meaningless as you're supposed to be at an advantage due to posessing the abilities of a fire demon. What use is your Pyromancy if it's crap and wont help you survive or help beat the bosses. It's good enough for trashmobs but fails at providing any benefit during boss battles.  Higher difficulties aren't hard due to gameplay but due to enemies just STUNLOCKING you without you being able to do anything against it (If you're not in Ranger Mode, that is) You NEED to be in Ranger stance to even be able to survive Bosses due to the 'Dodge' skill. Bosses will either Stunlock you to death or instantly break through your Parrystance and then Stunlock you to death. The Warrior and Pyromancer have NO MOBILITY skills at all so you have no way to react on AoE effects as simply running out of the 'zone' is too slow and blocking it doesn't work. Neither of the skills in Warrior or Pyromancer tree are remotely usefull against bosses so if you're playing on higher difficulties any point you don't put into Daggers and Ranger are wasted.  PS: There is no way to respec your points, at least there wasn't one by the end of ACT 2. So if you're the kind who loves to go into a game 'blind' and who likes to 'experiment' with skill trees, you're going to have a bad bad time.",

The cavalry isn't coming, no legendary heroes are left to defend the realm. Intriguing and unique premises. Love it. On the other hand, BBF's combat can destroy the seemingly awesome experience in mere seconds. The general feeling and flow of moves, parries, strikes, blocking- stiff, counter-intuitive, broken. This is how combat mechanics SHOULD NOT be made. Hate it. Ultimately, I'm recommending Bound By Flame, despite its glaring flaws. The journey is worth it..or is it?

            "review_text": "The game is kind of a mess to be honest. It certainly has some cool ideas, but there are just so many things wrong with Bound by Flame. Its a low budget action RPG disguised to look like some triple A Bioware type game. I was pretty excited when I first bought it, and I foolishly thought that it WOULD have a more higher budget feel, but after a few hours of gameplay I soon saw this game for what it really was. It's not all bad, and I do commend Spiders for their effort. I think this studio has a ton of potential and could someday very well be the next Bioware or something. However, the negatives outwweighed the positives for me with this game. The combat is...kind of terrible tbh. Incredibly unbalanced. Making enemies way harder than they should be. The voice acting ranges from average to mediocre for the most part. The companions are completely usless and for the most part uninteresting. They either do very little damage, or heal very small amounts of health. The story itself is fairly short. Though it does have some kind of cool moments. I do like the choice system. The story centers around your character being possessed by a flame demon. Throughout the game, you can either give in to the demons will(making yourself take on the demons appearance in the process, which has its benefits as well its consequences) or you can choose to fight it and keep your humanity intact. Thats about the only cool part though in my opinion. The story itself is not aprticularly interesting.   I know It says that I am not reccomending the game, but I do think Bound by flame may be worth a playthrough if you enjoy these types of games and are willing to overlook a lot of the rough edges. Its not the worst thing in the world. It certainly has its enjoyable moments. Just don't expect too much",

(no FPS-drops or chrashes)  Cons: - Most bosses are very annoying and will pin you against a wall whilst happily ending your life. - Very limited options when it comes to attacks. (no combos or ugradable skills in that aspect) - In the start of the game your character attacks so damn slow it will hurt your soul (upgrade attack speed as soon as possible!) - Frost enemies in chapter 3 especially. (not much to explain, they slow you down to a ludacris degree making fights horrible and needlessly difficult)  Decent RPG that won't make you cry or cüm.

            "review_text": "First of all, I want to say that I am a gamer for more than 15 years and have experienced many, many games. And RPG is my favorite genre.  So here we go. Bound by flame is a demonic fantasy world RPG with so big potential and so amazing universe. The game follows Vulcan (regretfully, although you are asked at the beginning of the game about your name, you are Vulcan...) pretty interesting character who has a demon inside him. The first bad thing that you will meet is the mediocre voice of the NPC's and of the main hero. There are some not that good jokes and insults along the way but if you don't really dig into it, you will be fine. The good thing though is that the voice changes as you choose what to be - a good hero or a bad demon.  The game takes you to pretty different quests and nasty creatures. The cool thing about this RPG is that it's pretty intense and you go along with people who helps you along the way. The bad thing is that the combat system is pretty hard and really, really hard to expert. The bosses are hard sometimes and if you jump directly to higher difficulties, you will be pretty annoyed, but there are much games with bigger expectations and budget and are a worse.  Given the fact that it's almost an indie project with a new, small studio developing the game, I really enjoyed it and I recommend it to RPG fans. I don't share with the general opinion that the game is not worth it. I hope that there are more projects like that one so you don't play all along the same thing everyday.  ",

I rushed main quest with a few importnt sidequests and at the end of my 11h hours of play, I have determined that this game cost unfortunately too much for what it is worth.  Graphics are okay (let's not talk about lip sync) but a bit to much year 2000 according to the new RPGs who got out recently. The game is very generic, not much of an open world but the story still makes it enjoyable (Although we end up beating only 1 of the 7 Ice Lords)   In my opinion, the 'Choice of good or evil' is kinda false because first you cannot beat the game without those OverPowered fireballs critics on the bosses at melee range, and also with the few skill points we get to fill the trees, the 'ranger' part is a bit left on the side since the stealth feature is not so useful at all, nor the crossbow or even traps.i have beat this game with raw power and the demon's magic.  Maybe 20 diff main weapons. Blunts and axes are not good enough compared to the swords wich makes em useless. I have seen 6 sort of crossbows and 7 sorts of daggers. Maybe 5 or 6 Sets of armor, wich doesn't have much difference between them. Returning to the main weaapon section, not enough emphasis on those 'unique weapons' (Mjollnir, dragon's eye or something) and these 'unique' ones weren't good enough to match my common sword found in a merchant.  Teh craft feature is interesting but not enough exploited since i was able to sell some tainted items found randmly for 10k and i bought 200 of each potion, wich made the crafting completely useless at the half of the game since the crossbow and traps gives less DPS and less Interrupting than my Warrior Stance skills.  Musics and Audios were pretty dam cool, the music in the BlackFrost mansion is quite cool with the chorus tone vocals.  And at last, every bosses should have been as hard/long as the last one. Gives more challenge. The bosses/mini bosses were completely and purely parry, critic, fireball. no features, no doppelganging, no mirror images, no doubles. And the 4 Concubines were a joke to handle.  I feel like this game is n indie game that I would have bought for 20 bucks on featured steam sales, but i still enjoyed the game. good elements. good fights. tactical moving.  And GOD. Please add some rolls in fight. In every bloody cinematics our protagonist rolls all over to avoid hitss and yet in fight i wasnt able to make a roll dodge or anything. not even when blocking/parrying. makes us hard to fight against those cold woman with 2 swords and 4 arms !  This game wouldn't suffer of a faster paced action fighting though, i felt kinda slow at the very start !",

Middle Market games are almost exstint these days and Focus Home Interactive are one of the few (if not the only ones) that are giving small devs with small budgets a chance to shine. A VERY rare sight to be seen in the Modern Gaming Industry.  A mix of Dragon Age and Fable, your choices influence yourself, your party as well as the rest of the world. Bound by Flame perhaps has the deepest weapon and armory customization I've seen in a long time and it is most welcome. Every weapon and piece of armor is unique and can be tailored to your needs as well as style. Combat can be a little clunky at times but Bound by Flame relies more on tactics rather than straight hack n Slash. Defintely recommeded if on sale.",

Personally speaking I feel like an idiot paying $40 for this game and would get my money but if I could, but, sadly I can't, so I will continue on in BBF and hopefully manage to suck it up long enough to get to the end.

You need to use stratagey and timing, both learning how your 3 skill-sets intertwine and your enemies moves and attack pattens. That said. the game is far from perfect and is in need of some SERIOUS late game balancing issues. There are 2 health upgrades in the entire game and once you've got them, that's it. I had them both before the first major boss in the game and was later running into that guy again as a regular enemy with friends. Your gear and health doesn't scale well enough for that kind of punishment. It doesn't help that most of the late game enemies have attacks that take off over half your health and are unblockable, and dONT EVEN GET ME STARTED ON THAT DAMN FROST CONDITION. There are 4 types of status effects in this game, 1 is pathetic; a 'dark' effect that drains your mana for a few seconds, 2 are pretty much the same thing; two different types of poison and are well balanced. But then there's Frost, a condition that has lead to me being combo'd to death at least 15 times by now. Frost slows down every single one of your animations by a large amount while you're effected by it. This means your stagger animation (that is already a tad too long for weak hits IMO) is nearly TWICE AS LONG as before. Get hit, you're likely dead. Doesn't help that most of those unblockables I mentioned earlier cause Frost.  I feel this game could have been so much better if it had just been beta tested more. The graphics aren't the best, but it's not about them at all (honestly, I couldn't care less about the graphics a game has, it's gameplay and story for me) and the voice acting is a bit subpar, but on the whole, it's not a bad game.

The gameplay is oversimplistic, despite what the trailers will show the only thing you need is to be able to use your block/evade button at the right time and you will never really have to worry about being hurt save for AoEs.  Crafting is always more than a step behind. It's simple -- get what you need and make it from a menu. Is it what you need, though? Not really. For example crafting traps? Can't say it's too useful. Sure, make yourself a minefield and lure things over to it. Done.  But the biggest axe to grind is the story. When you say that a story has a beginning, a middle and an end? That summarizes the entirety of this game. Of course, trying to be fair here, the premise SOUNDS interesting and certainly has its attraction in that idea. Big undead army that's more or less unstoppable? Sure. Only thing that can stop them is a hero with demonic powers? Okay, I'll pay that. Your choices are always binary, though -- that is, one or the other. Do you take the option which gives the demon within a little more room or do you take the option which retains your humanity. And that's fine.... really, I mean it. But this is the part that makes it outright stupid-- your character's relationship with the demon? Almost non-existent.  But the biggest part that you learn to hate about this game is that the story itself is just.... incomplete. Incomplete and poorly presented. That guy you saved? He died anyway. How do you find out? Because a text entry said so and one of your companions brings it up briefly. The undead army you're fighting is a big threat? If you say so! Why can't you belive they're actually a bad thing? Well, there's a lack of urgency. In games you need that feeling of urgency -- you need a choice to be difficult to make to make that decision have weight. You won't have that here because there's no real urge that pits things as being impossible for your protagonists to even do. It has so many plotholes most of which make absolutely no sense and lack crucial context. The demon within lacks a strong personality.   Overrall, this game gets a big 'NO'. Why? It's incomplete. It's not a game that would be too bad had it cost less than $10 and even then, that would be overselling it. But for $40 you'd expect at least a complete story.

            "review_text": "'You already own Bound By Flame'  I wish I didn't though.  This is - and admittedly I only got a couple of hours into the game because the voice acting made me want to bite my keyboard in half - the worst game I have played in 2014, including a free rail shooter dragon nonsense with Games for Gold on XBL and 'Pay2Win the Gathering: 2015'. Maybe the plot gets better - wouldn't know, as unmemorable characters and ♥♥♥♥♥♥, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ voice acting had me rolling my eyes so far back in my head that I could see my brain melting. Fantasy cliches can still be woven into a decent story, but this has no redeeming qualities. When you're questioning your motivations, along with every NPC lemming that aids you or arbitrarily hates you, it's not generally a good sign.  Generally, I'm quite forgiving of graphics if a story is good, and can overlook a shallow story if the gameplay and scenery is interesting. On both counts, it's not. This actually reminds me of Kingdoms of Amalur in a way - I haven't a clue what that game was on about in the end, the Magical Kingdom of Whimsyshire while I saved the Rumpledumpins from the Trololodgers. Who knows. But the combat was mindless fun, and I put more hours into it than I thought I might (thought my total on Steam is inflated because I tabbed out of it for several days and forgot it was running, which says a lot about me). While I'm loathe to harp on at the writing continuously, it doesn't even have fun combat to back it up. It feels dated and clumsy, leaving two counts of 'f*ck this ♥♥♥♥' in the Con Column. There are better RPGs out there than this, and better coming up. If you still feel the need to soldier through it, wait for a sale. A bigger sale. The kind of sale that starts '0.xx'.  I, however, have taken to using this game as the second option in 'Would You Rather?' People would rather mate with a ginger or let a Box Jellyfish sit on their face than finish this.  (I honestly think it's one of Dante's levels of Hell, along with slow internet and British Netflix.)",

            "review_text": "Let me first start out by saying I don't mind hard games. I enjoy the challenge of doing blind playthroughs of games on the hardest difficulty and seeing how well I can learn and adapt to steep odds. While this game is hard, there are a lot of things in there that just seem to be a result of lazy programming. The problems are:  No control over combos. Want to do that one move that stuns your enemy or a quick blow in between your enemie's attacks? TOO BAD the fighting in this game boils down to who can flail the hardest as you have no control over which attacks you do. There are really no combos other than Left click, left click, left click x 1 billion and they all do random ♥♥♥♥. Sometimes you will do a heavy swipe that will stun your opponent, sometimes the very same heavy strike will not stun the SAME EXACT opponent. Sometimes left click will have your character do a forward lunge and sometimes it wont. ♥♥♥♥ just happens when you click LMB. The only logic that I could get from the combos is that it might be affected by the distance between your character and the target you want to hit at the moment you press left click and thats pretty much it.  Enemies that do a ♥♥♥♥ ton of damage while you do very little damage. This is a a horrible part of the game since oftentimes you will be fighting against mobs of enemies and when every enemy you fight is a tank that hits you like a truck, combat isnt fun, its a chore because 1 or 2 mistakes will mean you're dead and have to redo almost 10 minutes of gameplay.  Being stuck in an infinite stun lock against groups of enemies is a thing and completely ruins the combat. There's this one part pretty early in the game where you have to train new recruits how to fight and they BEAT THE ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF YOU because they all knew how to coordinate their attacks so you'd never be able to retaliate unless you wanted to get hit once and die.  The counter system is buggy and useless against getting stunlocked by groups of enemies. A big part of Bound by flames combat is to perfectly block an attack leading to a counter. Since your character pretty much has no attacks that can stun his opponent leading to actual combos, this is pretty important since the only way to do damage is to contantly press LMB until you see the monster rear back for his attack animation and then hit you. However, sometimes, even if you react perfectly you will still take the damage even if your block comes out right.  TLDR: Buggy combat, enemies op and you are underpowered, a guy kicked me out of my block and proceeded to keep kicking me while I was down so I couldnt recover until I died.",

If you have any corruption at all, you're stuck with ♥♥♥♥ endings, you need to be all human and do the sacrafice ending to get any kind of recap or anything without a credit scroll. If you ever have corruption key choices are made for you that determine NPC followers. So really there is no freedom and the path is set for the BAD endings as soon as you get any corruption. Also note siding with the demon removes your capability to wear armor pieces, so only choose to if you want to go flatout mage.  Combat= Combat would be fun, until you realize there is only ONE viable build, Ranger with Pyromancer support, or Pyromnacer (demon path) with Ranger support. being a Warrior will just get your ♥♥♥ kicked, you'll be slow and the end game boss, infact several bosses and group fights will rip you apart. There isn't enough damage mitigation in the game to save your ♥♥♥, it's all about mobility and attack speed. So having 3 trees is pointless, it's really only viable with Ranger/Pyromancer unless you are on the EASIEST difficulty, even then it can be a pain.  FIXED= They fixed dialouge issues with NPC's handing out spoilers, read the below review for an examples so that boosts my rating up to 6.7.  PRO's  *Difficult, in a good sense, I hate games that are too easy, you get bored, this game doesn't dissapoint on any difficulty. *Shiny,  *Good viceral combat, you don't become roll face god mode at any time, you move around and dodge. *The story has a great premise and an OK way of delivering it. *Replayability for Full human or full demon, honestly you can't save before the end and ge the demon endings, each path has 2 endings, but only the pure human and sacrafice endings have a unique ending tale. Still worth playing twice to see the DEMON mode. *Crafting  CONS *Buggy visuals, quite often *NPC dialouge bugs out often enough, case in point, an NPC wanted to be with me for a certain fight, i took them to that fight, then afterewards the NPC acted like I didn't take them. *No quest markers over NPC's you have to revisit everyone multiple times through out chapters. *Minor choices have huge resounding consequences, and seemingly huge decisions don't mean squat, save scum often. *Lots of foot travel to the same areas for a chain of quests, gets boring.  Advice* While there are many armor sets throughout the game and you have limited weight capacity here are the ones worth keeping in order. Don't destroy any of the pieces till you have all of the others, these have the most mod capabilies, and the best stats. Everything else is really filler and can be scrapped. EARLY GAME:Swordsman MIDGAME:Ranger LATE GAME:Officer ENDGAME: Elite Soldier  Combat 9.0/10 Story 7.0/10 Exeution 4.0/10  END SCORE 6.7/10 Worth the currently cheap price, has potential, maybe Spider can improve on it's shortcomings, play for the combat and the shiny   *OLD REVIEW BELOW, WAS A THUMBS DOWN* As much as the combat can be fun, that's all it has really going for it. The reason it gets downvotes lets start with the fact that conversations give away quest spoilers or the ending of the game long long before you reach the end of the game. For example *SPOILER INCOMING BUT THE GAME WILL SPOIL IT TOO* You'll get a hot mage lady she's not entirely trustworthy. In Chapter 2 during companion conversations you just bring up she used to be an Ice Lord, casualy like you always knew, and she responds in kind, filling you in on all kinds of personal details, skip to about 5 hours later you OFFICIALY find out she was an Ice lord *DUNDUNDUUUUUN* Drama anger can you trust her omfgploxing? Wait wait you spoiled that for me yourself about 5 hours ago. ♥♥♥♥ like this happens ALL THE TIME! You pull information from thin air in conversations and plot decisions from inforamtion you were obvioulsy supposed to have found out, but never actually did. Your ability to make choices, is fairly limited, the instances where making a choice seems logical, it gets scripted and you get no choice, like say absorbing the body of a lich, which transforms you, removes your ability to waer helmets and pisses off the elf prince. But you know, getting a choice to allow the demon to stop 'mind confusion' seems like ti will mean the death or life of your friends, nope guess what, it doesn't, it means nothing. Seemingly major decisions are infact cosmetic and the really major decisions are chosen for you with no say what so ever. It's like very very badly written novel by a 9th grade student, or a first time DnD Dungeon Master. Honestly wait till this game is like 9.99, it's worth 9.99. I would even say it's worth 14.99 if you really really want it.  5.9/10 a D- PRO's Shiny OK but not spectacular combat mechanics  CON's Buggy Inconsistent story progression Non sensical decision making Falsely advertised freedom. Forced choices in a game that pushes the 'your choice matters' advertising Early vs Late game Combat Difficulty Balance is way off",

            "review_text": "Bound by Flames: The Game Where the Choices Don't Matter and the Crafting is Insane  Hello, my name is Dunban Nymeia and I'm giving Bound by Flame a 7.5 out of 10 n__n  This game honestly was a breath of fresh air. With RPGs published this month including the beautifully elegant Child of Light and the somewhat comical Stick of Truth, Bound by Flame was refreshingly dark and serious in comparison, lending to it the sense of struggle and desperation that the story strives for. The level of character development and interaction left me wanting to explore all of the dialogue options simply to learn more about the detailed world of Vertiel. Considerable thought went into building up the lore behind the game and it did not go unnoticed.  The voice acting I found to be a bit inconsistent though. With some characters being splendidly well done, others were seriously comical in how terrible their delivery was. With an extremely limited character creation (male and female models, a couple of cosmetic mods like skin tone, hair, tattoos/scars), a story that was paradoxical at times and personal choices having a minimal impact on where the story goes with itself (it truly does affect how you approach combat late game however!!!), this western RPG loses some of its strongest selling points as an RPG that offers player diverse and customizable experiences. The decisions do radically affect the relationship with your companions, but aside from that, much of the game remains similar.  The combat was a bit odd in my opinion though, as with my high-end computer, I found a 0.5 second lag between button press and Vulcan's actions. But, by the 3rd hour, I was used to this (unintentional??) timing and combat was truly enjoyable. Thinking ahead and paying attention to the enemies' attack patterns and proper positioning are key, as more often then naught, you will be caught in a brawl within a tight area not allowing much breathing room and every move could bring victory or defeat. Being able to switch freely between Ranger style and Warrior styles on the fly was a neat trick, allowing for multiple approaches on combat, but I found myself mostly sticking to my powerful main weapons such as swords or battle-axes over my knives. I could definitely have used my knives (just getting used to timing the dodge-counterattack-ripost with the aforementioned lag issue), but I just found it quicker to slash with my weapon, interrupt the enemy's action and take victory for myself by counterattacking everything thrown my way with critical strikes. The only instances I used the Knives was to clean up a few trash mobs and quickly deplete a single enemy to zero health. In mobs of varying class (spewers, archers, shield corpses, heavy weapon skeletons), the Warrior's 360 degree parry ability (must be upgraded from simply parrying from the front) truly was a god send as you're being bombarded from all around and the effectiveness of the Ranger's dodge (a jump to directly behind you) was hurt by the tight area of combat that game seems to enjoy throwing you into.  And with this, it can be said that all the companions were very useful. On the lower and normal difficulties, the companions you chose can be left to act based on their programmed AI and would actually put up a decent fight. And depending on who you brought, they could make or break the fight by acting as a distraction while you heal or by attacking from afar dealing damage or debuffs or both. However, on the higher difficulties, the companies become noticeably squishier and you must constantly adjust their roles (Autonomous, Survive/Defend, Aggressive Attack, Focus Special) from the tactical menus if you hope for them to survive the skirmish and lend a hand.  The strongest aspect throughout this entire experience though has to be the crafting system though. While crafting and modifying things on the fly in the middle of combat may seem a tad bit broken, it truly offers innumerable ways to approach a situation. Find yourself being destroyed by a melee juggernaut? recycle or craft the ingredient to upgrade your gear to focus on physical protection. Need to protect against an onslaught of Magic and Poison? do your best to rebalance your gear with what supplies you have on hand.  With gold being truly hard to come by and merchants selling at exorbitant prices, you must choose between sacrificing gold for basic ingredients to craft immediately for the situation or bide your time to get that awesome piece of gear. All this to say that the crafting was not game breaking, but actually another aspect of the games tactical nature in and outside of combat.  Finally,while the game looks absolutely splendid on the higher settings on PC, sometimes the several bugs I encountered ruined the moment by distorting the placement of character models and messing with the dialogue audio, ruining the mood and the cutscene altogether.  On multiple instances, I simply reloaded an auto-save to simply rewatch the same cutscene with no bugs present. The fact that I was faced with any bugs altogether seems to be a dose of bad luck, which plays to the games disadvantage because if these bugs are not consistent in their appearance across multiple copies of the game, then no patches will be released in order to address these serious impediments to the flow and progression to the story.  Hope you enjoyed this review and I'll see you next time!  Good Game &amp; Have Fun, Dunban signing out",

            "review_text": "TLDR: Bound by Flame is bound by design 4/10. Why they think this is a good combat system and even used it again in their newest sucky game Technomancer is beyond me because nobody likes that game either.  First, I have around 15 hours in this game and Steam is displaying my time played incorrectly. Second, they thought they were clever with their combat system from Mars War Logs but it sucked and they went ahead and put it in this game anyway. $40 new (I paid $20) for fifteen hours of completely linear gameplay with no reason whatsoever to play the game ever again after you beat it is a joke. I paid $20 and feel ripped off. $10 would be more fair. It is one of the most frustrating games I have ever played because the combat is just not very good at all, just weird, and I was not often enjoying it until the last boss. It is so bad that I said F it and am now looking for a trainer to cheat and beat the boss then uninstall this dog crap for good. I was doing well, eventually beating all of the enemies in the game but this game is just unacceptable on the last battle and I am in no way ashamed to say I am just tired of this game and am getting a trainer for it. I do not care. The only thing I am ashamed of is to say I wasted $20 on this game. I have no doubt that if I actually tried a few more times I could beat the last boss but I am just so sick of this I do not care anymore. Every battle is insanely hard, and not exactly always in a good way. The game can still manage to be fun if you are a very skilled gamer and have a astronomical amount of patience, and I do not have much of the latter. The fetch quests and general running around is insanely boring and feels pointless even though it isn't. Everything is incredibly easy other than the combat. Find something, click mouse 1 to pick it up, take it back to person, add some dog crap awful combat mechanics in, and there you go. Oh and by the way, even on the LOWEST difficulty, the last boss fight is nearly impossible. I had said before that the worst final boss fight in the history of video games was Cavestory+ but this one takes the cake. Whatever tiny bit of fun I was having throughout the game was crushed when I got to the last boss fight. It blows my mind that it is not the chief complaint about the game among all of the user reviews. The combat in the game sucks. Even fights against weak enemies put you at such a disadvantage that it will be a chore to beat them, and it is all because of the controls, how you feel like you are fighting on the moon but the enemies get to attack at normal speed.  Oh and a problem equal to everything else is how short it is. It is supposed to be a $40 third person rpg and it is only about 15 hours long and is 100% linear with no point ever playing through it twice, not ever. It is a 100% ripoff. The other problem is that the skill trees completely suck, all three of them. They barely add any improvements to your character and the improvements that the skill trees do add are stupid and nearly useless. And when you get new weapons and armor throughout the game, their stats only increase a point at a time. The one-point increase that a new piece of gear gives is negated by the fact that enemies gain strength as the game goes on. The weapon and armor that I ended the game with felt the exact same as the basic ones I started with, because they basically are. You never do more dmg, you never prevent more dmg, and the skill trees offer nearly no help.  Seriously fk this, this game is a prime example of why piracy exists and why not nearly as many people pre-order games as they did five years ago. If the devs for this game are smart they will do it right in the future and scrap this game's awful combat system, if they even made enough money off of this game to make anything else.  4/10 combat engine 0/10 last boss fight 3/10 skill trees are nearly useless 0/10 armor/weapon upgrades because of enemy strength scaling negating any improvements 3/10 length. actually since it sucks so bad I give the length a 9/10, should've been even shorter lol 5/10 overall  They need to seriously scrap this game's combat engine and make a new one for their next game.",

            "review_text": "Bound By Flame is actually a better game than many give it credit. Currently, it divides the community like Marmite - you either love it or hate it. The STORY is interestingly fresh in it's details - it's the fantasy war for survival we're used to but, in this case, it's a war that's almost lost. You are literally the last of civilisation trying desperately to find some way to win in the face of total destruction.  COMBAT is difficult at first but once you get the hang of it, it becomes clear that the combat system is very skill-based. Proper timing is required to not end up a bloody smear on the ground and that makes it far more interesting than many RPGs on the market today. Playing it on easy is difficult! But not unfairly so. The developers were really trying for an experience wherein you feel like you (and the last of humanity) are hanging on by a thread against a force much more powerful that yourself and, if you allow yourself to get the hang of it, it's something that really keeps you coming back to the game again and again. You feel like you have far more connection to this character than you do in other games - even the FMVs are nice enough to sport an up-to-date version of the character you make, wearing your armour and weapons, etc.  COMPANIONS, at first, seem like a lesser version of a Dragon Age system but that too is deliberate - in this world, and this war, everyone is on edge and trust is a difficult thing to come by, making close friendships unlikely with everything that is going on. While your friends in Dragon Age follow you as the blazing star of hope against evil, the companions in Bound by Flame are thrown together by necessity and all are stressed to the breaking point. This, however, doesn't mean that they don't have their good side. In fact, you can have a lot of fun with them and everyone behaves like you'd expect in such a dire situation; making odd jokes, wondering if they'll make it, asking you what you think just for a glimmer of hope. And everyone has detailed histories, adding to the realism.  GRAPHICALLY, the game looks very good indeed. It's not the Witcher 2 - or the upcoming Witcher 3 and Dragon Age 3, but it's head and shoulders above the majority of the genre, and every environment looks like it has been given a lot of love and attention. Along with the soundtrack, the atmosphere created by the game is something interesting, new and involving.  CUSTOMIZATION is detailed and crafting is excellent. Every weapon or piece of armour that comes along is customisable, and still the game does a great job of making this system user-friendly.You could leave the game for months and come back, and understand everything again at a glance. Find ways to build up new weapons and armour to high-powered levels, or increase their utilities (like poison resist, poison application, and various other types of damage resistance, etc.) It adds a lot of fun to gaining that new piece of loot.  SKILLS &amp; FEATS are also really useful. Where I've seen plenty of other games introduce skills for you to spend points on that haven't really impacted the game, in Bound by Flame you find yourself counting your skill points, waiting to buy specific skills that suit your playstyle.  While the VOICE ACTING has been called everything from 'bad' to 'nothing to write home about', it hasn't bothered me at all. Honestly, I haven't even noticed any really *bad* moments. In fact, for the most part, the voice acting is very good, and manages to be interesting a varied, making it seem like a real and diverse world. Occasionally, the lipsync has been a little off but that hasn't dulled the enjoyment of the game for me.  And the MUSIC is incredible. Very different and otherworldly, it manages to invoke a feeling of epic-ness, desperation, intrigue and more. Action moments marry perfectly with the intense fighting on screen. There was even a moment at the start of the 3rd Act, where my character encountered a horrible/sad image in a sewer. Nothing is said where they stumble on the image but the music said everything that was necessary. I'm now on the lookout for the soundtrack - it's that good.  The PROBLEMS that the game really has - in fact, the only thing that has annoyed me are the occasional bugs. So far, I've only seen three. Although, the first two were not that bad at all! An enemy turned and wandered off during combat, and flickered in and out of existence until he vanished altogether. The second issue involved me doing something out of sync from how the game expected me to do it, and this only happened because of I was replaying the game and knew what was ahead. The result was that I did a minor thing later and it caused the journal to start tracking the finished quest again, but this did not affect the game overall.   The final bug, however, was VERY annoying. BbF sports a 'Demon System', where you make choices at certain parts of the game and can become more evil and powerful, or remain good and not gain an extra 'demonic' increase in spell damage (though you can wear one more piece of armour than an evil character). Both choices influence the end of your game, missions you recieve and how characters will view and interact with you - especially since the evil choice affects your physical appearance. The problem with this system is that, when I played it, it bugged-up: I chose the good path and my appearance still became demonic. The second time I made the decision, the problem returned and I became even more physically demonic, leading to different character reactions and missions than I wanted.  BUT so far as I can tell, I'm the only one unlucky enough to experience this problem, so likely it won't happen to you. At first, this soured my game experience and since I only have so much time on my hands, I did not believe I would be replaying it any time soon. However, after a week or so, I started it again. The action caught hold of me and have flown through. The issue did not repeat thankfully and I am now continuing on to the ending I wanted.  Bound By Flame is a very good game. Better than many are giving it credit for. If you are a Dark Souls fan you likely will enjoy combat for the skill-based nature of it. For those who didn't enjoy DS, and I'm not the biggest fan to be honest, you will appreciate the variation of attacks and approaches open to you, which are very wide and so very enjoyable - everything from stealth kills, to quick double-dagger combat with acrobatic dodges, to two-handed swords better fit for groups and literally booting your enemies back to throw them off guard - and all of these are upgradable so you can focus on your favoured fighting style.   Overall, I would heartily recommend this game, AND I would recommend that you really take the time to immerse yourself in the various systems and playstyles, there is plenty to keep you involved and busy, and -aside from the bug I encountered- plenty of reason to enjoy the game. It is well worth the money and, if I had to score it, I would rate it either a 7 or 8 out of 10.",

The voice acting is dreadful, the dialogues are unintentionally comic so bad they are, enemies respawn as if it was a MMORPG, and the game presumes you are going to farm for itens as well. The enemis are constantly recycled, the story is shallow and clearly the developer simply gave up lessa than halfway through the game and opted for a shortcut to the final. If that was not enough, the final boss is one of the most punishing and unbalanced you will face. Avoid, unless all theses criteria are met at the same time: 1) you are a fan of action rpg; 2) you are out of other options; 3) the game is practically free on steam.",

The only thing I can really criticize about the combat is that the only way to evade attacks is using the Rouge style, evade would be useful for attacks that can knock you down even if you are blocking. That is pretty much my only negative with the game that I overcame.  Overall I liked the game for what it was and enjoyed the story.  I RECOMMEND to play with a controller Score: 4/5",

It's one of the better looking games I've played recently, especially with regards to the character models. This is definitely an action game, although it has the addcitive rpg elements like leveling trees and learning new abilities.  The combat feels like a less rigid Dark Souls and is extremely challening. This is one of my major gripes with the game - the challenge level is so high that it is difficult not to simply drop the controller in frustration and walk away. However, it manages to remain compelling; even after dying several times to a small group of the game's weaker enemies - enemies who can defeat you in three hits if you do not defend yourself - I feel motivated to try again, planning my tactics and practicing the game's very intricate parry/interrupt system. A well done battle is very rewarding, with highly satisfying slow motion shots when you successfully counter an enemy's attack. These will sometimes chain several together, giving a feel reminiscent of bullet time.  The only other gripe I have with this game is that the dialouge feels as though it was written by a teenage boy who just discovered cursing. Attempts at being edgy or showing off how rough the mercenaries are just comes off as sophomoric vulgarity that serves no real purpose.  If you play Bound By Flame you will absolutely have moments during which you want just ragequit, but if you hang with it, overcoming the challenges can be very rewarding. I recommend this game for anyone who likes action games with RPG elements and gothic fantasy settings and who do enjoy a highly challenging game.",

            "review_text": "After completing it on Buffalo difficulty as a Ranger character, these are my thoughts of what I remember:  Ranger:  The quick-stabbing style was strong and fun. I liked being able to take out half or an entire group with surprise attacks without getting caught, and the fighting was constant if I dodged correctly. It lacked some kind of counter to the 'double-shield deadwalker' (DSD) which made fighting them tedious (not difficult). Only way to speed it up was to have your companion help, either by tanking him so you could stab him on the side where there was an opening, or having them interrupting him. The poison specialty helped, but I think there should've been more poison damage skills/crafts as the only poison damage buff was from a gem on the breastplate (+2 dmg/s). The final skill in this tree is too strong to miss, It's gonna be weird playing again without it.  Warrior and Pyromancy:  The only useful talents for me in Pyromancy was Flaming Weapon, which buffs Burning Weapon. I see a potential in the build and will go full Pyromancy with Ranger Stealth next time, and that's because the mana potions with the Apothecary feat only costs 1 tainted blood and heart dust. If it weren't for that, weak.  Warrior style could break shields sometimes. After maxing the Ranger tree, I tried getting the interruption bonus talents in this tree in the hopes of making the DSD less tedious by breaking shield in warrior stance and killing it with ranger stance. Unfortunately the shieldbreaking part seemed just as random as the kick ability could stagger/flinch. In addition to the randomness of kick, you could only get 1-2 hits in after a kick before the shield was back up. Before the DSD's showed up, it was much more effective to bait them to start an attack formation and go behind them and start mashing. I can't see how going warrior build is strong enough, especially for the lategame. But I have not tried it yet so I might get surprised.  Traps and Crossbow  I never used a trap after the intro area. It only dealt 50 damage, which I could do more with two dagger crits or a surprise attack. I was going to learn the second trap, but got too far in the story while I waited for him to 'take a day to gather materials' (I even slept a whole day to get him to continue it). Will try to get it and test it next run.  Crossbows were good and strong, but there were too few of them. I think I found 4 or 5 outside of the shop. I prefered the ones with 75% poisoning chance, as i had the poison skill.  Monsters  Good animation on attacks. Few have some near-instant attacks which can be troubling if you don't know the monster/pay full attention. The Impalers stab-attack is one I've had most trouble with. The small ones could get oneshot by a surprise attack and the big ones took 4-5 dagger hits after a surprise attack, so just needed a change of tactics. Otherwise I think only the DSD and Generals have a near-instant attack that was problematic.  The hp/defense was well balanced. Only exceptions are the big weapon deadwalkers (BWD) and shield deadwalkers (SD) where the former has more hp than the latter. I could surprise kill a SD in all acts, but in act one (before I had gotten a decent stealth damage dagger) a BWD survived whereas SD didn't. Later when BWD carry around a dark enchanted blade, they have maybe a bit too much hp and damage, but it was more challenging so I don't mind that.  The damage could sometimes be too much. BWD and DSD dealt half or 1/3 of my hp in one hit, but the BWD was very easy to read. Otherwise the damage was fine. There could've been a potion that counters poison and dark debuffs. As it is now, the poison will do a lot of damage to you and the only way to counter it is to drink one or two health potions, and for the dark debuff it's mana potions.  Story (SPOILER ALERT, skip it if you don't want any spoilers at all)  Interesting at first. I didn't get bored of the story during the playthrough, and the sidequests was rewarding enough in experience and sometimes material and storywise, so well done there. I was very curious of how I could play out this story from all the dialogues of putting the Ice Lords against each other and wether to listen to your demon or deny it in order to choose the path of the game. This turned out to let me down immensely as it turns out I only fought one of the seven Ice Lords repeatedly spoken through the game, go through his door and fight the demon inside. I hoped that by killing this Ice Lord, the door would close due to his death, or another Ice Lord would appear and close the door. Either way it would force us to go after the other Ice Lords, with or without your allies. As mentioned in some dialogues, being able to plot one Ice Lord against another, could be an interesting plot device which also could fill up some of their story. And as the Ice Lord you killed mentioned the other with the Juggernauts hating you for killing one, I thought some hellbent for revenge Ice Lord that would chase you recklessly would appear, until I cleared the game that is.   Conclusion  When I got to the end, it felt rushed. Story and worldlore had a lot of potential but ended prematurely. I will recommend getting this game when it's on sale, but I disagree that it's worth the full price. Also there were many typos in the subtitles (I laughed a bit when the subtitle said 'Needles' instead of 'Needless') and a few voicefiles that was for a different dialogue (Buffalo in act 3 at camp after completing his quest called out for help like when he was trapped).   I didn't have any technical issues, and I gotta say the loading and saving time was so fast I did barely noticed it.  For the graphic♥♥♥♥♥s; the graphics were great, but more importantly the animation was good and didn't stutter.  Other than that it was a great game. Hope the next game (not necessarily a sequel) will be longer and with more diverse gameplay options (story and combat) and bigger skill trees, so that it matches the great characters and worldlore you have in it.",

            "review_text": "Bound By Flame – Review By GMCamulos  Genre: RPG Platform: PC, PS4, PS3, 360 Publisher: Focus Home Interactive Developer: Spiders  When creating a game what do I want to add? A nice dash of action, some good graphics, great sound in both music/ambient and voice acting, a nice control system, a hint of swearing, a little somethin’ somethin’ for the guys, and conversely nice looking guys for the ladies out there, some good story elements, nice character progression and levelling and a metric tonne of other small little things that fill in the gaps between the aforementioned. Now, can Bound By Flame find the right mix or has the ever omnipotent game master added a dash too much of one ingredient and not another?  Gameplay: Bound By Flame was an interesting one pre-release. It looked like it had something really kicking for it. A nice combat style, a demon possessed player character (true we have seen a lot of those in the past), and hey, it was next-gen.  What we got from it was a fun solid (in areas) next-gen RPG. The story for Bound By Flame is that your character is a member of a mercenary force called the Freeborn Blades that are trying to protect the world from the Icelords who slowly taking over and killing anything they come across. The Red Scribes who hired the mercs to protect them while they find an ancient temple and try to perform a ritual to help out… can we see where this is going? The ritual obviously has to go wrong cause is the start of the game and all, and your character is left with a very nice and friendly demon residing in him… I mean let’s see, how bad could that actually be right? The demon will eventually try to get you to make the choices which suit IT best, which can lead to a very interesting storyline as your companions will treat you differently if they think you are turning evil.  So should you embrace the evil and grow an awesome set of horns and look like you are constantly warming up people three towns away, or will you keep your humanity and make choices that help rather than hinder? Well if you go evil you will find that the demon can be a nice kick into the powerful meter, but the choice is yours. It’s just a pity that its strongest feature is a nice combat and skill system. The three skill trees are Ranger, Warrior and Pyromancer.  I dare say you only spec into one of the Ranger or Warrior classes depending on how you want to play but some of the Pyro skills are very complimenting, such as the ability to have a nice fire shield or even ignite your weapon for more damage. A quick warning before moving on, the game did kind of shock me the first time I met an elf and my whole opinion of how they can converse was tipped upside down. The occasional swear in a game is fine, but when half the cast will try to slip one in every third sentence, it drags away from it being a fantasy game and just tries to tip into a game for less mature players. And don’t get me started on the fact that one of your more… well-endowed female companions looks like she could be shivering just looking at a fridge given what she is wearing… I still don’t understand the need to make a female character in a game have less protection than a male character… breastplates on guys… yet a breastplate on a girl will cup the breasts and show them off… I just don’t get it… And given that there is crafting in the game I kind of wish there was more I could craft, though the recycle feature to get some materials back is a very handy touch to let you experiment with what you want to make and use/upgrade.  Graphics: The game is next gen, so I would have liked to have seen a little more… pezaz?  Don’t get me wrong, it’s still solid and I can’t really fault it, but it’s still just at a level that says… yeah, we know we are making things for next gen, but we need it to work on everything else at the same time. Nice little touches pop up here and there, such as the changes your character goes through the more you let your demonic inner voice take over… but its things we have seen before in other games.   Sound: The sound is good, if we don’t talk about the lacking performance on the majority of companions. There is something to be said about your demon side and his influence and conversational chats, but the majority of the team seem to let me down. A nice casual chat while a player dies, no inflection of pain or regret, just “Yep I am dying…” ok, yeah, thanks… I mean, don’t say that, it’s not your time… bit more work could have gone into this side of the game, and I don’t just say that because I know a lot of voice actors who could use work *wink wink*  Skill Levels and Controls: Bound By Flames combat never really had me at a point where I felt UBER as I quite often get to in other RPG’s.  The game really does ease you into how the combat and levelling works at a nice solid pace in the first section, and just keeps going from there. On normal it still felt like the monsters of the world were levelling at the same time I was, it’s just that I was able to put points into my skill tree’s that continually allowed me to stay ahead of the curve.  Some fights still gave me a bit of a headache, but still, nothing you can’t overcome. Your choice of companions can also help with battle and thus can complement or just strengthen your play style, bit of a choice there to help out as well.  Replayability: With the amount of choices in the game, and deciding what you want to do, the game has a little replayability unless you want to see what it’s like to swap from allowing the demon to take over, or to be the man in charge all the way through. But it’s an RPG, when you know the story, you know the story. Nothing major is going to change from playing through it again.   Last thoughts: I did enjoy Bound By Flame, it’s a great little RPG which does have a lot of merits. I do kind of wish the game was longer and had a bit more variety, but hey, on the whole I did enjoy it and had a lot of fun playing through it all the same.  I give it 7 Demonic Possessions out of 10. ",

            "review_text": "This feels like an unfinished game that had the last act developed by an entirely different studio, simply because the original studio went '♥♥♥♥ it, cant be bothered, you finish it'  Hitboxes are terrible, sometimes being almost twice the length of the visible weapon or attack, sometimes missing attacks that are right in your face (these are less common though, mostly just on the rarer enemies like the Mimic things)  Dialogue and voice acting is passable at best, god awful at worst, and the subtitles have a tendency to include words that arent said, and have a good number of subtle typos.  The game claims to have 'every choice count' when in all seriousness most of the choices are menial, with only one or two choices per act (of the three Acts, too) meaning ♥♥♥♥, and most of the other smaller choices being unable to change your mind or take back for no good reason. (What do you mean i cant go 'oh wait, i DO suspect you' just because i told the dude i 'trusted' him. Bull ♥♥♥♥ reason whatsoever)  The trailer above (first one) shows far faster and more fluid and responsive (and fair) gameplay than the game even is, with most of the fights being a 15 minute long shitfight because half the enemies in the game have a healthbar youd expect to find in a JRPG... except they arent difficult regardless. Its a pointless combat lengthening technique that doesnt serve anything but to emphasise the tedium this game has. It has three skill trees, but make no mistake, you WILL jack of all trades if you try to focus on all three.  Your character is a very preset character, make no mistake, you have very few faces, very few hairs, and despite what GAMESRADAR (shame on you, Mass Effect is nothing like this ♥♥♥♥) might imply, your character has a VERY set personality. You dont get to be a super nice and friendly merc, you just get to choose what level of Renegade you want to be. Either the reckless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME1-2 renegade, or the '♥♥♥♥ all my friends' ME3 renegade, if you WANT to use Mass Effect as a comparison.  The fights are at best tedious, and at worst blatantly unbalanced. All the difficulty this game has comes from the amount of cluster♥♥♥♥ the fights are. The bosses that you fight alone are trivial at their hardest and pose very little challenge, but the smaller groups of enemies fought between can be either not too hard, to downright obnoxious. Quite frequently chucking a bunch of enemies at you with large(r) healthbars and extremely spammy attacks. Come ACT3 (Which is where my first sentence came from) and you will be fighting ONE enemy composition. Well, if you want to be specific, three, but its not different enough to count. Literally, its one or two different enemies in the group, but still basically the same fight. All involved are just a lot of AoE spam. Oh, and the archers can literally shoot arrows at you WHILE THEYRE RUNNING AWAY AND THEIR BOW ISNT EVEN DRAWN. OUT OF THEIR ♥♥♥♥. AND ITLL SLOW YOU DOWN, SO YOU COULDNT EVEN CATCH THEM IF YOU WANTED.  Boss fights are quite simple, very rarely posing any real challenge, except for the final boss, where the only difficulty is artificial difficulty created by a stupidly long fight that is just two boring phases over and over again.  Only good thing i can say about this game is that the graphics arent terrible. Sure, youd hope for more back in 2014, but not terrible.  (also, i DID complete the whole game, before anyone claims i gave up and just made this review out of rage. i dont regret the time i spent playing the game, but i wouldnt recommend it)  TLDR: If you were looking at this game, and thinking it looks and sounds like a Action RPG version of Dragon Age or similar, look elsewhere. If youre looking for a balanced, well rounded and engaging game, look elsewhere. If youre looking for a Dark Soulsy game but made with different minds behind it, look elsewhere. If youre looking for a punishing game that does very little to recommend itself, and quite often beats you into the ground with very little blame laying on the player... well... enjoy. I guess.",

DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. IT IS NOT FINISHED.  PROS:  -A pretty good soundtrack. -Promising concept that led me to purchase it in the first place. -A darn good trailer. -Okay graphics (except for the character models).  CONS:  *clears throat*  -Character animations look like they were made with one hand whilst the dev simultaneously had an existential crisis and wasn't able to give them his full attention in the face of how terrible his/her life must have been to find themselves working on such a sh***y game. -The voice acting is BAAAAD. Not just bad, it's BAD. Like in the sort of completely immersion breaking, IMPOSSIBLE to ignore bad. Yes, it is that bad. Hey, also- LIPS DO NOT SYNC UP TO THE AUDIO. E V E R. It's a nice touch. (*coughs blood*) -Combat is slower and more frustratingly boring than watching an old lady covered in cold molasses cross the street whilst tripping every five steps (who dies of old age before she can even get to the other side of the road). -The characters are stereotypical idiots with little to no thought put into them. There's (A) Gruff McGrufferson, your Captain, (B) Bit****ts McGee, the obvious romance who is shown as the damsel in distress TWO TIMES in the first 15 -- no, FIVE minutes that you first see her, Random-Ally-Idiot-You-Don't-Care-About versions A through Z, and of course you, (C) the cocky over-confident a****** who inexplicably got kinda strong offscreen before the game started and now thinks he's king of the world. I didn't say he/she here because the main character's dialogue is all from the perspective of a haughy muscular man, and they copy and paste it to the female MC playthrough. They did not even try to make a female perspective for their main character. Jesus, it's even worse than FemShep in Mass Effect 3. (JK Mass Effect is a TRILLION times better than this game) -The menus are confusing as all get out. I took one look at the skill trees and ♥♥♥♥ myself out of fear of going insane and wasting my life caring about them. The only points I invested were in the skills that made my dagger combo faster so that I could one button mash my way through this nightmare a tiny bit faster.  SUMMARY:  This game is a pile of cow dung that woefully proabably was going to be pretty sweet at some point, but then their publisher said 'no, f**k you guys we want character customization and skill trees' so it went from being a Witcher/Dragon's Dogma kind of sword fighting game to a hairbrained rushed mess that ended up so terrible I had to delete it after just an hour of playing it. That or the developers just didn't give a flying f**k. Thank GOD I didn't buy this for full price and only gave GabeN $5 for it.  DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.  THIS GAME IS NOT FINISHED.",

I have one major gripe though  Spoilers ahead  Basically, the game doesn't really have a very good skill balance. I found maybe three situations outside of the tutorial bit where using the daggers was preferable, and none where I wanted to use the crossbow. However, it turns out that the boss is just about impossible in close quarters, and my fireballs don't do anything to him. For a game that has the most emphasis on melee combat, this is unacceptable. Combine that with a lack of skill resets, and it makes the end of the game unplayable.  That being said, I enjoyed the story, but making it so unbalanced just broke it for me. Maybe buy it on a good sale.",

            "review_text": "Ok, so I generally don't take the time to write reviews, especially longer ones, but in the case of Bound By Flame, I just have to.  First off, I only paid $25 for this in a pre-order deal from GMG. That being said, I honestly don't think it's worth more than $5, if that. I watched the trailers for this game and I thought, 'Hey, this looks pretty awesome. I can see $25 for this.' The trailers, as I suppose is their job, made this look great. In actuality it is a sub-par, bad looking, even worse written, boring mess.  The graphics just look 'off.' During the cutscenes the characters always seem way too shiny. (Hey! I like to wax my face!) Maybe that's just me. I had issues where creatures got stuck in walls, where arms disappeared, etc.   Let's not even start with that lip syncing. My god, the lip syncing. There again, they could have got that spot on, but with the horrible voice actors they used it wouldn't have helped. (Sybil especially comes to mind.) Something else I found funny were (or sad, depending on how you look at it) were the copious amounts of spelling errors throughout the game. At one point they even spell the main characters name, 'Volcon.' (I kept waiting for them to call him 'Voltron.') There were also many times where complete lines of text wouldn't be spoken, or things that weren't written would be.   Oh yeah. 15 second music loops are my favourite thing about the game. Hey, if you're going to have music, at least don't make that garbage so short and repetitive that it DRIVES ME IN EFFIN' SANE!  Combat is repetitive and boring. It was touted as being 'strategic,' but I could find nothing of the like as I played. I spent most of the time in the Warrior class and spent most of my points there and in the Pyromancer class. I barely touched the Ranger, as I quickly found it was mostly useless. You also can set traps and fire a crossbow, but in the end I spent most of my time mashing Y/pressing light attack, using a fame sword/guardian flame, drinking a health potion (you'll do A LOT of this)... wash, rinse, repeat. And hope you don't get spammed by the cold (slow) spell and stuck in a corner from one of the maybe 12 or so different types of enemies in the game.  Oh yeah, one thing I never could figure out is, you're fighting Ice Lords, who are in or create ice areas for... hmmm... at least part of the game, yet your magic users use ICE SPELLS on the enemies?? WTF? Ok, so to be fair, the story was what made me want to buy this game in the first place, and that can't be so bad, right?     wait for it...    To quote one of my favourite words from the game, it's 'godsdamned' terrible. I mean, I'll give 'em this, they were thinking ahead. They knew it was too terrible for just one god. They had to go create other gods to share in how bad it is. Think of it like this:   Your buddy takes a crap. He says, 'Hey man, come here. I want to show you something!' So obviously, you follow him into the restroom to see what's up. 'Check this out!,' he says, pointing down.  (Ok, so we all know what you're going to say. Don't think we don't.) 'Hey man, that's a pretty awesome crap!'  But in the end, it's still just a floating turd. But hey, at least you got to share it with a friend, right?    **SPOY-LARZ** (skip to bottom if you don't want any story info)    So you're this guy, right... Well, one of five whole guys you can choose from at the start anyway... and you are part of some mercenary group. You cuss a lot and act like a complete douchenozzle and how anyone could care about you as a main character is beyond me. So these stone cold killas called the Ice Lords destroyed the world and raised a dead army. (There are seven I think. You only see one in the game and they call what I think are the same other six by so many different misspelled names I thought there were like 15 by the time it was all said and done.)  Anyway, you and your Merry Men are protecting some librarians doing a ritual. It screws up, and a demon flies up your butt. He wants in your head, but that doesn't happen until later.  You go to a city in a swamp, an elf city, some sewers, and the Ice Lord's castle. That's about it. You can talk to your companions on the way, but with those voices who the hell'd want to?!?  There is one real choice in the game that I can see. There may be two others, although I think they are predetermined based on the first choice. If you choose to let the demon begin to possess you is the only 'real' choice I can see in this game. You can choose to save the elves or take the power of a creature, but I have a feeling that, as well as the ending are set once you make that first choice.   If you choose to let the demon possess you, as I did, by the end of a game you'll become a flamer. (No, you'll seriously be completely on fire. What did you think I meant?!?) Go kill the general, go into the Worldheart thing, and fight another demon. Then BAM! it just... ends? Ummmmm....  So in the end, Bound by Flame has some pros and cons  PROS:  Cool name It's a video game. That's good, right? It's funny if you like to clown on things  CONS:  It costs more than $30, $20, $10, $5. Wait?! I paid money for THIS!!? Horrible story, voice acting, music writing spellinggraphicscharacterdevelopmentcombattttttttt..... It's been godsdamned. 7 out of 8 gods agree!

The graphics are really bland and dated, with basic textures, blocky shadows and are pretty unrefined to look at (and I am playing on high/ultra at 2560x1600). Some nice lighting occasionally distracts, but not enough.  Gameplay is very basic and is largely a left/right mouse button mash. There is no real dodge mechanic which really irritated me as a ranger-style player since all I can do is jump back and then try to sprint around the back of my enemy. I could have used some greater agility to feel like a nimble rogue.  Storyline is ok, but quite generic as well. Voice acting is overall quite bad with most actors sounding like they are mildly bored reading from a script. Characters barely emote or move in conversations, with no face emotions and exceptionally bad lip-synching. Totally destroys immersion for me.  The game this most reminds me of is Demonicon in terms of overall quality, looks and gameplay. If this was on a cheap deal and you were after a hack-n-slash RPG-lite that's not too pretty, then it would be a decent timewaster, but it's no big budget AAA RPG that will consume you for hours.",

I think you might have a fire spirit inside you or something? Either way, it obviously isn't very good if I don't even remember the basics, so instead I'm going to review The Witcher 3 for you:   If you have two choices - 'Play Bound By Flame' or 'Play The Witcher 3', you should play The Witcher 3. It has a wonderful story and memorable characters with some really great story choices that move the world forward in a reasonable fashion without promising all the nonsense that games like Mass Effect 3 promised. You guys remember that? Remember when Mass Effect promised that all your choices would change everything and the whole game would hinge on what you do... Then the ending was the same three generic tubes with a space baby that told you some screwed up version of the plot that totally contradicted what had been the plot before? Then you got to pick your favourite colour.   Then they had the audacity to 'fix' the endings by making them more 'happy'... Who the hell asked them to be happy?! It just wanted them to relate to the God damned story.   You remember the Knights Of The Old Republic games? They had a choice system too, but it wasn't so much: 'Good vs Evil', it was more 'Reasonable Human Being vs God Awful, Short Sighted ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bag' right up until the last choice. If I'm an evil Sith I've got to look beyond the simple things like currency. Money is great, but if I can convince everyone I'm a good person by doing good deeds and then call on them to fight my enemies knowing they will think me the kindest and most gentle soul in the galaxy, isn't that worth more than asking for 100 more credits?... Ohhhh, the unspeakable evil of Sith capitalism and price negotiation! Those monsters!    While we're talking about that, why are Sith evil anyway? Jedi oppress all emotion, even love. Sith are permitted to love. Why is any human emotion this instant, one way ticket to evil? I mean, we can all agree that emotional people do some awful stuff from time to time, but logical people can be uncaring, calculating and indifferent to suffering... The ends justify the means in their eyes. That doesn't sound better than a person who deeply loves his wife and children. Maybe if the Jedi stopped running around trying to murder every Sith there wouldn't be so much conflict?     Anyway, don't buy this rubbish. Maybe have a snack instead.",

Yeah, okay, the game looks cheap. It is obvious that the developers had a very small budget to make it, but it is still good. Gameplay is easy to catch but difficult to master (for those of you who will play - daggers for the win, guys, trust me on that!), bosses for the most part are really tough. The game doesn't offer much for those who love complex tactical battles, they are more based on using your reflexes like dodging at the right time and quickly counter-attacking. Still, it adds to the game's dynamics, which is great to my liking)  The story is rather simple, yet catchy, characters are... well, some of them strongly reminded me of Dragon Age: Origins. For example: early in the game you will find a sex-appealing witch with a lot of attitude. Oh, and you meet her in a middle of a swamp. Pretty much like Morrigan, yeah? And it's not the only example. Oh, and trust me: companions are completely worthless in this game, you'll have to do all the job yourself. The only exception seems to be Sybil who can heal you, the others though... Well, at least you can talk to them.  All in all, the game is good. Not perfect - good. It is dynamic, rather short (I beat it in 11 hours) to feel boring and it offers some challenge. Worthwhile)",

I can see this weekend people are looking at the game quite a bit so i thought i'd drop a review for your sakes and add a list of pros and cons. there are some iffy situations in-game that may turn you off but, there is never a 100% perfect game they could always use additional fixes and content. The game overall does deliver but, i wouldn't go as far as to pick it up for full price, now that would be quite absurd.   Pros: +Although bad dialogue, it is quite hilarious 90% of the time. +Unique battle system +Challenging +Can be played offline +Able to mix n' match skills across three different skill sets +Customizable armor (can be changed visually and add-ons to the armor sets are possible) +Clear plot +Straight-forward questline/stroyline (it will most likely never become lost) +Visually pleasing bosses/monsters that you'll find quite awesome +Crafting system (don't have to drop gold on every single thing you need)  Cons: +Sketchy dialogue (the actors weren't that great although they were funny) +Time consuming combat +Linear world (not rly open world but, there's a lot of area to move around) +Not worth 40$ (if it's not on sale, you can't partake in this coolness) +The archer style isn't really much of a skill, not dependable at al +Overwhelming and unfair battles (depending on what difficulty u pick of course) +Fairly short (10-15 hours of solid gameplay on normal, 25-30 levels of solid content) +No competition (a lot mmos offer player competition but, this one surely doesn't) +Not much replay value, after you finisht the game once you probably won't feel inclined to do it once more +The name you choose doesn't carry over to your game (#foreverVulcan)   Hope this helps during your decision to purchase the game or not, i think it's good for 20$ but, not entirely worth it for 40$.

Bound By Flame has a pretty decent story about a struggle for power within yourself and how you use that power to fix the world from the tyrants trying to take it over. Granted, it didn't really bring anything new to the table, it was still an enjoyable game. Enough so that i wanted to see how the story ended. There are a few choices you will make through the game that will impact the story a bit, which give it a good RPG feel, but nothing that compels me to go instantly replay to see what the different choices would of changed.  Now the good of the game. The combat is fun, though the block/riposte function took a bit to get used to and timed right. It did however give the game slightly more difficult combat and its not just about button mashing. There's also a decent amount of armor, weapons, and choices to upgrade them and make them your own. There's 2 fighting stances, heavy weapon and daggers, that allow you to jump into different situations how you please. The voice acting was decent. Not awful, but nothing fantastic either. Each character i encountered felt as if they had their own personality, which is why i feel this as a positive. Also the game length overall wasn't awful. I'd say there was maybe 6-7 hours of mandatory story and the rest was doing side quests.  And the bad. The graphics are sub par. The particle effects were good, but the models and environments left much to be desired. Granted the different stances were nice, i didn't find that the dagger stance put enough into the game to merit changing stances all that often. Bringing companions into combat didn't feel like all that much help either. Mostly just meat shields to help deal with larger mobs or harder enemies. Also you could chose how they fought and other then one being able to heal, there was really no change in combat other then what i stated before.  Overall the game wasn't bad. The combat was fun, the story hooked me in enough to want to find out how it ended, the graphics were meh, the gear and loot ♥♥♥♥♥ aspect definitely itched that itch, and other then the riposting element the controls worked well.

The game starts off really strong but that's about it.  CONS: -This is an insanely repetitive game where all the boss fights will basically be fought in a sequence of 'hit the boss and get away from the same frost AoE spell they all use.' -Your companions are useless. I don't even care if they are there. In addition to dull chracter development, they can't even bring a single enemy to 75% at the lowest difficulty level.   Yes, it's not Dragon Age or Mass Effect like other reviewers say but at the very least you still want to hold games to a certain standard where playability is enjoyable. Bound by Flame does not meet those standards. Use your $5 for a different steam RPG ",

It's robust auto-save made any issues like that moot, however, I recommend manual saving frequently. All my temperatures were under 50 deg C with most of the graphical settings maxed. I left Shadows on medium and stuck with just the first level of SSAO. The rest of it didn't add a bunch to the game and increased the GPU workload greatly. I found the game is best played with a controller, but you can switch back and forth with both enabled. The visuals are servicable with a slightly cell-shaded bit for the backgrounds that work well. The voice cast is servicable, some members better than other. The music is /really/ good.   However long I have on my play log is how long for me to beat the game completing most of the sidequests. It's short for an RPG or even an action game, even though it starts out appearing that you might have a long road ahead. There is a pronounced difficulty spike at the start of the 3rd chapter. I ended up using a trainer because of it. The hardest fight in the game was not a boss fight, but a battle with 3 different sub-boss enemies all together. Story is okay, but could be better. The protagonist is a sarcastic badass, eliciting reactions with the NPCs whether you want to or not, playing into the story. There are some interesting NPCs, and they don't seem to try very hard. I feel the best chapters are the first two with the 3rd having a good premise but the aforementioned difficulty spike hampering my enjoyment. The ending (I only did one) was pretty well done.   I don't know if I feel it's worth the $30 USD price on it in the store. With the Spiders RPG bundle, I feel it is worth it with the other games or if you find it on sale for under $15 USD. I feel if there was more gameplay, I'd be more okay wth the price, but you don't get much with 2 different paths.   ",

It wasn't quite mass effect but it was good.  --------------------------- Storyline 6/10  The story for this game completely made sense wasn't particulary amazing but it was good. It's a shame it was not terribly long.  --------------------------- Difficulty 4/10  This game is incredibly easy. I picked this up for the first time and blitzed through the game side quests all on the highest diffuculty in less than 12 hours. Only the last boss is remotely difficult which took me 5 attempts. Enemies telegraph attacks from a mile away and you can pretty much become immortal by spamming backstep through enemies attacks. --------------------------- Gameplay 8/10  This remindes me of Dark souls A LITTLE and Dragon Age Origins mixed together. The game is pretty fluid and although there are some things I would liked to have changed such as more enemy variation and better/more areas with more options than 'Climb'. Add some traps in and more enemies!  Overall 7/10 For a first release by the company I think that this game was great and I reccomend buying this game and any other titles the developers make in the future.",

            "review_text": "ok so i've been through the game twice now and think I can give a decent judgement on the game  the story line has alot to fit in because you are kind of starting at the last chapter in a way. Humanity is almost wiped out and are pretty much fighting a losing battle. There isn't any time for a slow build up like other games where usually the antagonist isn't known yet. It's kind of an apocalypse/end of days setting with just the remnants of humanity left. It would be like starting mass effect 3 at the story starting point without having played the first 2.   I think alot of people don't get the combat, you can't just wade in to a group and button mash, archers need to be taken out first for example and it's also essential to learn how to parry/riposte or dodge, you can't face tank and expect to get anywhere in the game. You can die in like 3-4 hits but most enemies are slow and you learn their sequences. It's pretty much like the witcher combat, which people also complained about because they couldn't just hit attack all the time. There's a learning curve and I think it's decently challenging and not bad.  If you go full warrior spec. you will find it underwhelming and they aren't comparable to the mage spec. Most effective playstyle was to stay in ranger stance so you can dodge and put points into the mage tree, upgraded you fire 4 fireballs at once. Also the first tier of the ranger tree you can sprint in combat so yeah sprinting around in combat behind slow moving targets and firing off a cluster of fireballs at point blank range makes the fights actually pretty easy. There was only one fight with 2 concubines that took a few goes.  Mercenaries are not that helpful admittedly in combat, it's best to just take sybil except for when you need to take someone else and put her in defense mode. She will be a decoy for some mobs in group combat and will heal unless she is being pinned down and will heal post battle saving a need for pots or downtime for health regen. There isn't any type of way to augment your mercenaries so I don't know how they scale.  I thought the graphics looked pretty good played out at max, the player model especially when it's turned fully demon looks very sharp. It has a really great soundtrack which I thought added alot to the immersion of the game.  The voice acting/dialogue is passable for a budget game, there are dialogue choices which can have an impact on your mercenaries though there isn't much depth to it as you end up at the same point in the end.  Like any RPG you can augment your gear which will depend more on what style you are playing, it's fairly basic and the crafting system is not complex.  The game is around 15 hours doing every quest and You will want to play it through twice if you want to experience other playstyles and see alternate dialogue choice endings.  I don't think this game ever tried to pass itself off as a AAA game with a huge studio and multimillion dollar budget. I didn't expect any more as I paid $35 for this game new which is almost 1/3 the price of any other new game where I live.  it's not perfect but I think it is still an ok game of a 6 or 7 rating and the bound by flame universe is interesting enough if they expanded on it more that I still enjoyed this game enough to buy any dlc/sequel",

            "review_text": "First off, let me say, yes, I do recommend this game. Second off, you’ll most likely enjoy it more or be less annoyed if you can get it on a Steam sale.   Bound by Flame  is a linear RPG set in a dark fantasy setting (mostly medieval humans, elves and undead). Where this game tries to stand apart from all the other dark fantasy RPG games, in my opinion, is the following:  1. Combat options are limited - either a two handed sword or dual wield daggers - but you are empowered by a fire demon to buff your attacks and give additional fire damage. 2. You can upgrade or customise the armour and weapons that you loot or buy with ingredients that you can loot or recycle from weapons or armour. 3. It is quite difficult. Presumably the developers aimed at Dark Souls difficulty, but for me the easy difficulty was enough of a challenge to keep me interested.   Bound by Flame  is a good game – it is not an excellent game, yet you could believe that the developers were aiming for something spectacular, but then their time or money ran out. Some aspects of the game are truly excellent, but unfortunately the combination of all these aspects aren't as polished as you’d like.  The music is excellent; combat music or ambient music. It sets the somewhat sad and melancholic mood that underlines the whole “end of the world” situation.   The 3D models are quite good, however the quick time movie events that tells the story could have used more work. The voice acting was well executed, but unfortunately the subtitles contained quite a few spelling and typographical errors.   Character creation is very limited: you get to pick one preset face out of four for each gender.  Environments / maps are limited. Think  Dragon Age 2  maps, but for a shorter game. Enemies respawn, so you can farm for loot or XP if you'd like.   Combat is quite basic, yet effective. You only have two stances: melee, using a two handed sword, and ranger, using two daggers. Timing is critical as you have to block or dodge, stun (by means of a kick or crossbow bolt) or attack between enemy attacks. You can also make use of fire magic to buff and support your normal attacks (e.g. setting your sword aflame or throwing fire balls).   You get to loot each and every enemy you kill. Loot entails weapons and armour, as well as raw materials with which you can craft potions, traps, or components with which to upgrade your weapons and armour.  Story wise it’s a tried and tested formula. The world is in danger and you have been empowered to be the only one capable to save it. You gather some companions to help you in this struggle, but certain choices will cause them to leave you. The choices are somewhat artificial – it doesn't change the story at all, except for the final scene and end credits. It is quite short; I wasted a lot of time farming and replayed a level or two and still finished in 20 hours. However, at the end of the game it feels like the developers had had a longer game in mind but were forced to quickly tie everything off and finish it.  Comparisons have been made between this game and far bigger and more successful games. Sure, the whole choice system is getting to be an empty promise as precious few games allow you to truly change the story by means of your choices. The storyline is always the same but for a few inconsequential differences. Therefore don’t expect this game to revolutionise the choice system, or anything else for that matter. Play it because it contains just good and clean hacking and slashing, some disturbing imagery, and some unexpectedly well rendered graphics and witty dialogue.",

Unfortunately, the developer either didn't have the money or the time or the talent to actually realise these ideas. This game is just not particularly good.  The story is, on paper, quite interesting... but generally awful voice-acting and dodgy writing made it very hard for me to get invested. I just didn't care about the world and its people, so why would I want to save it? It was an easy choice, then, to 'embrace the demon inside' but even that was very disappointing. No one seems to acknowledge that my character is looking more and more demonic.   In fact, the game seems to have a hard time recognising your character in general. My female character was addressed as a man more often than not, really. Dragon Age Inquisition this isn't.  The combat system is similar to The Witcher 2 but lacks any semblance of nuance. Quite frankly, all enemies have stupendous amounts of health and armour whilst you yourself can easily be killed within three hits. Even on the lowest difficulty level. It's touted as 'strategic' combat, but don't be deceived. What they mean with 'strategic' is that you're expected to go for hit-and-run strategies when you're facing more than simple zombies because otherwise you're in for a world of unfair pain.   Graphics-wise this game isn't overly special but it isn't bad either. I found that the game ran really smoothly on my system (which isn't the bulkiest rig around, I can assure you) and the caverns had some nice glistening wall textures. Hair looks terrible, however, and the lighting has an excessive bloom effect that just blurs everything.   By the way... Did I mention that the voice-acting was bad? It's been a while since I have been so frequently annoyed by voice-acting. The voices are ALL over the place, with 'British' accents that sound like they were done by Americans, some terrible 'Oirish' accents and some inexplicable Americans too. I mean, why exactly is the main character American when almost everyone else speaks with some sort of British/Scottish/Oirish accent? Oh, and one character in particular sounds Russian. Because why not.  Overall, this is a budget game that has bitten off more than it could chew. Only die-hard RPG fans should consider acquiring this, and even then, you have to ask yourself if you don't have better games to spend your time with.",

The crafting system is a nice addition to the game but it is as limited as the actual vote power of democracy. A fantastic soundtrack with memorable sounds that fits the game and adds depth to the overall experience. From a graphics point of view this game is not a jaw dropper but it suffices. The main problem here is the way the storytelling is executed and how there is no real interaction with the npcs and the followers along the entire journey, of course you speak to them every now and again and sometimes they share some of their knowledge or opinions along the way but that's it, apart from that they just stand around lifeless and even at crucial moments you would at least expect them to look at you. I'm not going to spoil the ending but in my opionion the whole decision making in this game is quite pointless. Romance is a complete disaster as if they wanted it there but just lacked money to make cutscenes and additional speech lines. Overall this game is a dissapointment with the execution of its core purpose which is story telling, intriguing but stale and sometimes simply funny where its not supposed to be.  I do recommend it though because I feel like the mere 10-12 hours of story including pretty much all side quests and experimentation can deliver some fun and epic moments. I do want to complete the game fully on harder difficulty levels and unlock all of the achievements but I feel like it would just be a pointless grind, maybe one day I will come back to it and go through all of this again.",

            "review_text": "The main issue with Bound by Flame is ambition; it tries to do everything you'd expect from an RPG of this genre - and it does this adequately - but it doesn't really excel in anything to make it stand out among the crowd.   Despite this, the game did provide 11 hours of entertainment. I would recommend purchasing this on a sale, as the game is probably not worth the full price without some more polish.",

            "review_text": "This game is a mixed bag. It's not bad, but it's not great either.    Narrative -  While not really original or brilliant, the story is ok. Can't shake the feeling that is rushed though, since a lot of the big characters (like the Ice Lords) are just mentioned and never actually make an appearance (save for the one and only you'll fight during the game). The majority of the NPC (companions included) are also bland and uninteresting. You will have simple romance options, a bit of lore, branching choices and all those features that are more or less become a staple in this kind of game after DA/ME, just not expect them to be deep or really meaningful. Voice acting and characters lines follows the same way: sometime are good, sometime not. I don't feel like complaining about it though, i've heard far worse.   Gameplay -  The game features a nice crafting system and 3 skill tree equally viable with 5-6 abilities each and some upgrades; sadly the combat is absolutely obnoxious (you will spend more time dodging than actually hitting your foes). Allies are basically just meat to distract your enemies, they are completely useless in a duel. There is also a lot of backtracking if you want to do sidequests. Overall not a positive experience.   Graphics and Musics -  Visuals and models are not special in any way, however the cellshading and light effects are pretty well done, and the end result it's quite pleasant to the eyes. The OST is good, feels appropriate and it does the job during the cinematics and relevant cutscenes, as well during explorations and fights.   Conclusions -  Honestly i'm not really sure if i should recommend it. I'll probably never replay this again because it didn't leave me a good enough impression, but trashing it completely would not be fair to the devs. If you need an action RPG fix this game could be okay for you, provided you get it on sale. Just be aware going in that it's nowhere near AAA titles of this genre, and that the gameplay it's heavily flawed by the bad combat system.",

            "review_text": "The writing and voice overs in this game are cringy, at best.   The core concept of the story/setting is pretty intriguing and something you don't usually see - the protagonist getting possesed, and having to co exist with the spirit (or demon), and becoming more powerful in return. Mostly everything beyond that falls apart though. Characters, story and even the world get very stale after a short while, and the way you are railroaded to either goody or baddy is frustrating.  The gameplay is quite enjoyable at least. The combat is fun - it is responsive and also challenging, if you like DS's combat, you'll like this game's, except the combat here is, imo, more fun than that of DS's -, the crafting is pretty nice and convenient even if sometimes it can feel a bit too easy, and the leveling process if quite simple but enjoyable.  I wouldn't recommend picking this up at full price, maybe on a discount.",
