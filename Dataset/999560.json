    "description": "Fragile Equilibrium is a game about the imperfection and impermanence of life. It is a reflection on transience, a balancing act to find beauty in decay and inevitable destruction. [FE] invites the player to explore a world of quick actions, forced decisions, and subtle shmup-style strategy.",
