            "review_text": "If you are the type who keeps working at something until you get it perfect, try this game! If you like games such as the Build-A-Lot, Farm Frenzy and Tycoon simulators, this is for you.   It's a bit tricky to wrap your head around to start with, the tutorials teach you the bare basics (there's alot to figure out yourself as you go) and I almost gave up - but it is a puzzle game for a reason! Now I have a handle on the game mechanics, it's so addictive I can't go a day without playing.   By far the trickiest part of the game after learning how to make successful drugs, is how to handle loans and income streams. You can't really do much without taking out loans (or at least this is how my gameplay works).   I've tried looking for a similar game but haven't been able to find one. I'm hoping they release a similar game before I tire of this one! Getting master on all levels is very difficult, so it should be a while :)   Just downloaded the DLC and looking forward to many many more hours of enjoyment. 10/10",

            "review_text": "I wanted this game to scratch the same itch as games like Infinifactory and Factorio, but I found the game to be a bit of planning and then a whole lot of waiting around.  The goal of maximising your profits meant that I would pause the game as I planned out each build chain, and then when I finally unpaused, all I could do is sit and watch for a long time as either my Scientists or Explorers gathered more progression for me, or I earned enough profit to pause the game and build something else.  Also the lack of a planning mode/phase meant that I would waste money after I build most of a production line, only to find out that either I miscalculated or ran out of room. If you place a conveyer it costs you $100, and if you then destroy it you only get $50 back, even if you did it right away! If perhaps the game only charged you upon unpausing the game, then perhaps you could go nuts building everything without fear of going broke due to mistakes.  I felt like the random elements in the game did not offer enough variability in how you play the game. It's just a matter of looking at the few incredients you have available via the unnecessarily clunky interface, mixing them in the same ways, and producing a product that you then proceed to forget about because it is time to move on to the next product. Then you run out of sockets and just spend the next 30 minutes watching the timer count down and your bank balance go up.  This game simply is not for me. I gave it a fair shot but found myself pushing myself to give it more, in hopes that something would change or get better.",

            "review_text": "I love puzzle games, but I'm not afraid to admit when they get to be too much for me. SpaceChem is a perennial favorite of mine that I burned out on way before the end, for example. Big Pharma shares certain similarities with SpaceChem, but with a layer of corporate management on top of the mind-bending puzzles. It's an interesting combination, and also a very exhausting one.  You get to be the CEO of a pharmaceutical company, which turns out to be a lot more interior design and number-crunching than the vlogging and buying Wu-Tang albums that I expected. Starting with a small empty room, you import ingredients through hatches in the walls, run them through a gauntlet of machines, and funnel the resulting pills, creams, and tinctures back out for a profit. Each ingredient has positive and negative effects that are activated at different concentrations, so your machines can raise, lower, and rescramble concentrations to make effective medicines.  Cramming all the necessary machines and connecting converyor belts into the space you have is your primary concern. You can research and unlock more efficient machines but you're trading space efficiency for higher running costs, which must be weighed against the profit of the drug. These values in turn fluctuate with the cost of ingredients, the market demand for that cure, and any competitor companies in that market. This is the management layer I spoke of and while you can do well enough ignoring price fluctuations, more difficult scenarios and the Master-level goals require you to retool your operation based on the market, especially once patents come into play and companies start locking each other out of producing specific cures.  This additional layer of complexity may be unwelcome to those just trying to wrap their brains about their assembly lines. Cures can be upgraded to more valuable remedies by hitting specific concentrations with specific machines. This sometimes requires catalysts mixed in with special machines, which might also require re-arranging your chemical's traits with yet another machine. All of these processes must then be crammed into limited space, and layout mistakes can be costly to undo. An efficient, profitable line is incredibly gratifying to put together, but it can be a difficult road to get there.  You'll have over three dozen scenarios to choose from, with goals ranging from make X dollars over Y years to deliver Z quantity of a specific drug. Regardless of your goals, the means will be similar, building assembly lines for simple drugs while you research the ingredients and tools to make more complex ones, and refactoring everything when you start to run out of space. New machines, upgrades, and rules may come into play in later scenarios, but never to particularly dramatic effect. It's one of those games where you really have to love the core gameplay loop because it's not going to deviate much from scenario to scenario.  The presentation is perfect for a puzzle game, with clear, colorful, cartoony shapes and pleasing animations for all your machines. I want to give special recognition to the sound effects, which reach Blizzard-levels of polish for how perfect and gratifying they are to hear. Machines make delightful buzzes and clanks, belts whirr along happily, and even the buttons have rich bleeps and bloops to them. It's an excellent concept assembled and presented as well as anyone could expect, so the only question is how long you'll care to stick with it. There's not a lot of variety to building lines or running your company, but if you want to build Rube Goldbergian coveyors and tax your brain in turning a profit, you'll find no end of content to keep you happy.",

            "review_text": "As a fan of games like Spacechem, the old Mysts and 7th Guest, TIS-100 even and pretty much any other that requires heavy thinking, I really don't get why there are 'so many' (22% as of now) bad reviews about this game.  Big Pharma is not as hard on your brain as some of these games I mentioned above but it does require a fair amount of thought and planning, specially at the begining when you're not used to it, and the hardest levels are also pretty challenging.  Put simply (if you're not in the mood for reading everything): the game is good, it keeps you entertained and focused for plenty of time.  People writing bad reviews mostly claim that:  1 - The game gets repetitive/boring - I disagree. Well, ok, every game gets repetitive - even life itself does - and Big Pharma is no exception. Still, you always get a rewarding sense of accomplishment when you see your production lines running efficiently, your drugs selling more than your competitors (and for a higher price) and when you get good trial reviews because you're a good man and ran the extra mile to make them patient-friendly. Also, every level has a different objective, and you can get a standard, expert or master 'score' on each, depending on how fast (usually) you achieved your objective, and that keeps you on your toe every time, avoiding any mistakes to get your 'master' rank in every level. You do, indeed, start every single level with the same formula (slight variations, but the same routine), but I find the game is still fun after 20+ hours playing it, mainly because achieving the master rank in the toughest levels is a good challenge.  2 - The 'managing aspect' isn't a big part of the game - Again, I disagree. You absolutely need the money aspect, and it fits the game perfectly in my opinion. You must keep your drugs (and their sales rating, if you have the DLC, which I recommend) profitable, your income on the green, to be able to keep going. You must beat your competitors (and fast) or they'll end up showering you with patents and taking a huge share of the market, diminishing your sales. You gotta be careful with the loans you get so their interest don't end up eating all of of your profits, and also balance how many explorers/scientists you have - and what they are currently working on - to keep enough cash flowing in and your company, again, ahead of the competition. In my opinion, the management aspect works perfectly with the puzzle/logistic facet of Big Pharma. It's a double-fun experience, specially if you're the type of person who enjoys both things.  I think that covers most of the 'thumbs down' this game has received.  ***  About the DLC:  If you liked the base game, you'll like the DLC. It adds some neat new features (check the DLC's steam page for specifics.)  ***  On a serious note / Something special about this game:  There's a very interesting and particular side to Big Pharma: it opens your eyes for how the REAL 'Big Pharma Industry' works, or at the very least it makes you think about it.  In this game, you can leave side-effects on drugs on purpose (and regulate their, as well as the cure's, strenght as you will) to keep demand for some of your other drugs (those that treat such side effects) up high. You can patent your drugs to get a temporary monopoly of a market's share and raise your prices up to the sky. With the DLC, you can run trials on your drugs and deliberately disqualify the bad results to trick the consumers and raise your sales. You... see where I'm going with this.  After playing this game, one must wonder: 'Dude... this can totally be done for real. Maybe real companies do this kind of stuff.' Then you keep thinking about it and... 'Why wouldn't they? Well... maybe they have principles, and goodness in their heart. Maybe they want to help people.' But wait... we're talking about some of the (if not THE) richest people in the world, people you never heard about, people whose names no one knows. People who torture lab animals on a daily basis, who tested prototype-drugs on jew prisoners during Hitler's Reich. People who profit from the suffering of the sick and weakened, and make a living extorting the dying. People who steal an old guy's economies dry under false promises of an unlikely cure (**Google 'cancer' here**).  Finally, you'll find yourself concluding: 'Man... screw polititians, mexican cartels, weapon dealers and african warlords. Big Pharma - that's the real nemesis of mankind.'  I just read that Johnson &amp; Johnson was just condemned to pay and indemnification of 55 million dolars to a woman because one of their talc powders gave her cancer. The doctors had to remove her ovary, and it was literally lined with talc. And that's a second (at least) for them because, months ago, they had to pay 72 million to another woman for the same reason.  If this example and reason alone aren't enough for you, Google 'Big Pharma' or any company's specific name (Johnson &amp; Jhonson, Pfizer, etc.) and read for yourself.  What I know is I'm never taking any medicine again unless it's strictly necessary (AKA I'm in heavy, constant pain). If you keep thinking about all this stuff, it's easy to see how far these companies can/could/do go to take your money (like an infinite chain of side-effects and their temporary-with-more-side-effects treatments). Seriously, we are on the 'genetic mapping age', how hard can it be for trillionaires (the Big Pharma industry generates a trillion dolars per year) to cut off side effects and balance a drug's components if they want to? Damn, even I can do it, according to Big Pharma (the game).  ***  Conclusion:  Big Pharma is a very nice game. It gives you a sense of reward every time you score a 'master' on the tough levels and that's the raw thing every game aims for. If you like puzzle/management games, I'd say this one should keep the average guy entertained for 30-40 hours, maybe more (it took me 70 hours just to get 'Master' on all the levels in 'Advanced' and beyond). That's good value for your money, and this is the kind of game that you start playing at 6pm, play for one or two hours straight, quit, and realizes it's already 11pm.  If you're concerned about the negative reviews (I always and seriously take them into account myself), maybe you can wait for a sale, but I really don't think you'll regret your purchase at full price, as long as you understand what the game is like (the screenshots alone can give you a fair idea) and feel you are going to enjoy it - the game's execution itself is great, that is not going to disappoint you.  EDIT: btw, I never got a single bug or crash whatsoever.  EDIT 2: ok, now the game has crashed once, after 45 hours or so.  EDIT 3: I just found out that this game was made by ONE dude, alone. That always baffles me (Terraria was also made by a single guy, if I'm not mistaken). I, myself, can barely get dressed on my own, so... congratulations Tim, amazing job.",

            "review_text": "Big Pharma is a surprisingly entertaining little game with some great puzzle elements and an enjoyable biz sim. Here are my pros and cons.  Pros: 1. Enjoyable puzzle mechanic that makes creating new drugs addictive. 2. Impressivle large list of items to research and drugs to create. 3. Enojoyable and simple UI that is very sleek and well designed Cons 1. Game sondtrack isnt varied and it can get annoying listening to the same couple of tunes over and over 2. The game lacks alot of options and stats that you would really wanna see and would vastly help you get more info about your income and costs, but the new DLC really takes great strides to improve this area so I would highly recommend getting the DLC. 3. While I personally think the price is acceptable I defiantely feel that for pure amount of content it is slightly above where it shold be listed, 15 or 20 sound more reasonable. (Get it on sale and it will be well worth it.)  In general the game is awesome and if you're any fan of company simulations or medical sims youll love this game. The team seems so far to be doing a great job, they are consistantly updating the game and using to dlc to add some real needed mechanics that make the game far more enjoyable and give it more depth. Im excited to see what DLC they'll be offering next. The game has so much potential for even greater growth with dlc and im excited to see where it leads.",

            "review_text": "First off: I own this game from their website before the steam release, so my playtime is higher than the 0.4 hours it claims right now.  TLDR: Even though I like many aspects of the game, I can not recommend it at its price as it will not keep you entertained for very long.  Do I somewhat like the game? Yes. Would I recommend it? Not really, especially not for 23 Euros.  I love the setting, I feel there should be way more disease/medical-related games and I do enjoy the graphics, by which I mean I don't mind the simplicity. I like the making of new drugs, the setting up of belts/arrangements, the tight budget, the slight humour, the ideas like exploration and the reasearch tree.  So why wouldn't I recommend it? Because it gets boring, and it does so rather quick. The reason for this is, that its repetetive. Gamesessions usually are done in 1-3 Hours depending on difficulty and consist of you researching new techs and producing new medications with increased difficulty in the setup of your conveyer-belts.  The Problem is that its the same each mission. And the Drugs/Ingredients are completly interchangeable. Unless youre a 'Letsplayer' you wont care for the name of the made-up Drugs/Ingredients within seconds but they will just be stats like 'increase/decrease concentration by 3' so thats all you do.  You find the easiest way to reach that wanted concentration. And theres only (when fully researched) like 3 ways of increasing decreasing, meaning +/- 1 ; +/-3 ; half/double. So thats not hard! In fact nothing is really 'hard' in this game. Theres no need to make difficult choices, as you will most likely produce every medice you can as far as research and exploration go, since every 'tick' gives money, theres also no need to think about if you should keep the medicine going - if it ticks in money, keep it, if it loses money, replace it.  The result is a very easy game and the 'challange' comes from increasingly hard scenarios. But this doesn't mean anything interesting like 'do this-and-that with 3 rooms' or so, no, while there are ~5 different types on missions they all play the same, as you just need to make more of the best kind of medicine, cure a number of people, make some money or something along those lines, so they all mean you build up your, lets say 'empire' and then at some point you win. And weather your task is to make 5-super-medicines or to make X Million $ doesnt matter as you do the very same thing. The Difficulty of the Game (which does go quite high in the late game) only comes from increasingly narrow timelimits, so the medium and hard difficulty is identical, except in one you need to make (lets say, not sure about the real number right now as it doesnt matter) 5 Milion in 10 years and on hard its 10 Million in 5 Years.  So after 10 hours lets say you will start more than your 10th game (the easy games go by rather fast) and you will do the very same thing the 10th time in a row, still not caring. And since setting up the conveyer belt-systems is the only real aspect, and you do that about once every 5 minutes, you will have done that about 120 times. And then its just routine, theres no fun to be had (there hasn't been in quite a while) and all you do is click your new belt, wait for money to pour in, click your new belt a.s.o.",

            "review_text": "In   Big Pharma  , you take the role of a CEO of a pharmaceutical company, and you have to take your fledgling company from minor painkiller pusher to mega-corporate cancer killer.  At the start of the game, you are dumped into an empty factory lot where you will be able to start building production machines and start manufacturing some cures. Each segment of the factory will have an input point where you can choose to pull through certain ingredients which may or may not have positive attributes. Running these ingredients through a careful setup of specific machines will either emphasise or dissipate the base positive or negative effects of your ingredients. Once you’re happy with the result, throw what you have into a pill machine and pipe it out through one of your output points where it will be given a name and shipped off into the world to be sold.   You can also put scientists hard at work to research some brand new machines and ingredients, or simply improve existing ones. This is a nice way to improve the quality of your production lines and keep a consistent, stable way of producing reliable cures and boost profits the legitimate way.  The   Marketing and Malpractice   DLC helps to give you more control on the money side of things, and instead of just selling a cure for a set price throughout you can hike the cost of a drug when you know the demand is high and people are in desperate need of it; something as simple as a paracetamol may be in high demand after a tragedy somewhere in the world, and you can use it as an opportunity to charge a fortune for it. You can also undercut a competitor to gain your own company more money at the expense of theirs, adding new ways to play   Big Pharma   and causing you to be savvy off the production floor as well.    Big Pharma   does feel unique, as it’s rare to get an economic/sim game that was built from the design level up to be a morality play on human greed. People who enjoy business sims, and want to engage with something that requires planning without overzealous micromangement may find   Big Pharma   to be the cure.   THE GOOD  - Unique morality play in a sim game - Addictive gameplay  - Adds a new personal approach to playing - Perks system   THE BAD  - Feels somewhat barren - Suffers from repetitive gameplay - Once you’ve played around with the features it loses appeal  DISASTER | BAD | MEDIOCRE | OKAY |   GOOD   | GREAT | AMAZING | MASTERPIECE",

Obviously, I have played a lot of hours, but as another reviewer mentioned, you get to the point of wanting to complete all the missions/scenarios instead of playing for fun.  Figuring out how the machines work, strategies for making money, etc are fun at first. What happens is it takes some time to get machines unlocked, etc. while playing in missions, so you find yourself doing essentially the same strategy for every scenario up to the point of fulfilling the mission objectives. For example, several missions are 'earn xxx profit in xxx time' - well that's easy enough once you have done it for $1,000,000 you can do it for $10,000,000. There are missions like 'cure xxx xxx times' or 'supply xxx drugs', again, once you do those once, it's fairly easy to repeat. The AI players are pretty much a non-threat.  I believe there's a good 20 hours of playtime in the game. After that, it starts to become repetitive.  My advise: Buy it on sale. $15 or under would be OK.  To the devs: Game is good but too expensive for what it is - I wish the missions were more varied. I wish you could really ramp up the difficulty and the AI was an actual competitior.

The second part of the game is a spacial puzzle. It starts out simply enough. Very simple production lines bring ingredients in and pump packaged drugs out with a few steps along the way to prepare the formula. As you progress in the game you will unlock many new ingredients and cures and technology used to prepare them.  Initially, the game only offers you selections that are available at the current level. As such, the game appears quite basic on the surface for the first dozen or so scenarios. As you progress further in to the game, however, you unlock a great deal of new research projects and technology.  Many of the negative reviews I am seeing for the game (not all, but many) are suggesting the game is very basic and has a short lifespan. These same reviews were mostly written by players who had between 2 and 6 hours of play time recorded. I suspect most of these players didn't even play long enough to see how much added complexity there is when you unlock patents and stage 4 cures, etc.  Highly recommended to programmers or anyone who enjoys optimizing engines. The production line component of the is reminiscent of SpaceChem.",

Only slight variations and you will end up with pretty much the same machines each time. It is a VERY linear game. -Space is very limited, so you cannot build exactly what you want.

If not, prepare your ♥♥♥♥. &gt;Some things seem utterly random , such as which side effect is on each ingredient &gt;Some effects contradict themselves &gt;You will be in debt a lot. No idea how people hit the 600$ daily when I can do at best 200$ when being careful (this is on EASY by the way).

I have a superior product (cure and sales rating), no side effects and it ISN'T dominating the market... when the only other one is a weaker, side effect ridden competition drug. How???  Neutral: &gt;There's a learning curve so take time to learn.  &gt;The tutorials aren't too easy to follow, so pay attention  That's about it. It's a game that you play a challenge and once done, you take a break. Come back the next day.  Advice: Beat the tutorial. Free build is nice to test out things (a good idea, especially about combining ingredients), but is utterly boring to play in. Custom build might be better if you want to practice techniques for challenges. It gives you the ability to learn how to properly research, search for ingredients, deal with money, etc, WITHOUT being restricted.  So again: Free build if you wanna quickly try out how to combine things or how equipment works. But use custom build to practice for challenges. The challenges can be very hard and very easy. The game is rough but fun, but very exhausting. It's not the greatest but it does the job. It could learn from other games like Rollercoaster tycoon.",
