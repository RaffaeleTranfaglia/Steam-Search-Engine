I know that when you look at the price of this game and you see money being thrown at a pixelated stripper, you automatically think 'this game is a total joke'.. or perhaps that this game is 'cheap garbage'!  It's actually pretty darn fun! ..until you play two or three 'two-minute' games and your forefinger starts to get sore from clicking your left mouse button a few thousand times, lol.

I was in my early teens back then, and I can promise you it would have been something... soon after Sinclair, Commodore, Amstrad and many others started releasing their home computers (micro computers they were called back then). By the time those came out, this game would have been obsolete.  I will admit I didn't pay anything for it, got in a giveaway, and still I feel cheated, I mean I would probably refuse to play it even if you paid me an hourly fee.  Still I have to appreciate that this is probably a joke, by someone who wanted to show how you can get anything on steam. If its not a joke... I don't even want to think about it.  Then again... it does have trading cards... that is its one and only asset.",
