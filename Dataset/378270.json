            "review_text": "From the creator of Envy the Dead and The Tape comes the horror FPS title, Putrefaction. The title has a simple premise, which sums up to a new plague has begun to spread and it has been infecting people, transforming their bodies in a ravenous manner. To combat the epidemic, a special force was created and lucky you, you're part of it. Sent on a mission to recon an abandoned base in the mountains, you must find the source of the disease and put a stop to it.  As you can tell, the game doesn't have the most thrilling of plots nor does it have much in the way of written context either. In fact the only snippet of story you get in-game is at the very beginning and that's it. If you've ever played Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, Serious Sam, Painkiller, or any plethora of semi-wave based shooters, then you've already played a better version of Putrefaction. The title introduces nothing new, it doesn't reinvent the wheel, and it certainly isn't one of the best out there. However, for an indie game it's decent, and given the fact that it's developed in Unity Personal Edition it's surprising that it runs at a mostly stable 144Hz; only dipping down when a lot of enemies and gore are on the screen. Speaking of blood and guts, there's a pleasing amount in Putrefaction, and your shots can also dismember your foes.  Basically, you wander along a fairly linear path over the course of 8 levels, picking up weapons, ammo, and health as you go. Occasionally the game will put up a barrier to make you stop, forcing you to kill a few waves of enemy spawns before letting you progress forward. The environments are fairly empty and open, but the assets and lighting are adequate; you will wander through some catacombs, an underground cavern, and a few research labs. The enemy models are uncommon, and it's nice to see a Unity game that doesn't have the same old tired monsters. Surprisingly there are a good amount of weapons that include a shotgun, freeze gun, rocket launcher, energy gun, and your standard rifle, and each of them have a special alternate fire mode.  Personally, this game made me disoriented several times. I'm not one for motion sickness, but a combination of the headbob, weapon recoil, and especially the awful way the character jerks around when he gets hurt is completely dizzying. It would be nice if there was a feature to disable these side effects, or at least turn them down quite a bit, as this is the biggest downfall of the game. Another down point is that the developer made the end boss neigh impossible on the hardest difficulty, so be prepared for an unfair 'challenge' if you choose to go that route. On the upside, Putrefaction does boast an acceptable soundtrack that's reminiscent of a knock-off Nine Inch Nails.  Overall, Putrefaction is a mediocre horror FPS. It's your basic Doom, Quake, Unreal Tournament, etc. clone, but for a low budget indie title it really isn't that bad. Mind you, you're going to be asking yourself why you're not just playing Doom or Quake or Blood instead, but after you've spent the 30-40 minutes it takes to beat the game plus the additional time for the survival mode achievements (if you care), you can go play something better. If you're willing to give it a shot, grab it on sale for a buck, otherwise just wait until you have nothing better to do.    Rating:  2.0/5.0  - It's not awful, but it's not great.",

            "review_text": "I got 2.6 hours gaming time out of this. That's one run of the single player campaign,and one round of the survival mode. I paid £2 so I am happy because I will play it again.   Putrifaction gets a lot of flack, and the main criticism is it's a sad Doom take-off. Such stereotyping. On its own merit, Putrifaction is the start of a good game. OK some of the guns either look or sound a little basic, as do some of the sets. However the writers-developers seem to have looked at all the successful old style single players, and mixed them here.  I particularly liked the stonework settings, and I liked some of the guns. Most of all though, I liked playing it. I swear, I got my money's worth in the first room where monsters attacked. After that room I joked to myself, 'yup, if it crashes now I got my value already'. It wasn't even a spectacular room. It was the way I felt.   I know I might sound like a paid reviewer, but I am not. If it was pityful, I would say that and leave it there. My only real grumble was the last boss. If I had not looked it up on youtube it could have taken me ages. Anyway, the short of it is, I will be looking out for a sequel. I rate it 4/5 stars. Loosing a star for last boss and being only 2.25 hours campaign. I wanted more. If a sequel developed upgraded looks and sounds, we'd have a brilliant game. Nice one devs.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game for 0.39 GBP. I think I completed it in about 1.5 hours, roughly. When I first loaded up the game I was quite tempted to turn it off. But I am glad I didn't. It's not a long game, and you can tell it's made by just one person, but It's fun for what it's worth. I think what made it fun for me was figuring out exactly how to kill some of the 'things'. There are certain methods that standard FPS games dont use, and that made this one slightly different.  The creator has certainly put some thought in the level design, gradually introducing the player to ideas first before throwing you in the deep end. The sounds were a little corny, and I didn't find the game particularly scary at all - so I think 'horror' is a bit too far fetched.  But hey - Was it worth 39p? Of course it was. If I had made this game I would be proud. It's fun, it's short, it's a bit silly in places, I enjoyed it. I felt like i was playing someone's baby. Oleg - you've potential, my suggestion would be to find a team and work with them. You could create something great.",

The level design is also very interesting, makes you want to continue playing just to explore the levels. Bosses are also interesting and creepy.   Game runs very fast and loads on the second. Good value for a 5 Eur purchase. I liked it.   On the other hand, the total gameplay time you need to beat it and explore everything (on Easy) is 2-3 hours.  Very good if you want to relax and have some fun after a long day. If you are looking for something more serious, this is probably not for you.",

            "review_text": "Dropped a dollar on this to get a shooter and I got just that. I can't say it would be worth $5 though. I'll organize my thoughts in a list.  -Gunplay and combat is alright. The secondary fire for the shotgun (which shoots a type of rocket) will explode as soon as you fire it if you are also moving forward, luckily it doesn't damage you. Also contrary to the storepage there are no pistols that I saw (more of a nitpick).  -Level designs are bland for me and has wonky decisions made for them. A couple times I had to backtrack to kill a couple enemies that spawned in later so I can magically unlock a previously-locked door.  -Enemy spawns are horrible. Not only do they spawn in in the weirdest and absurd places (that can catch you by surprise) but there is absolutely no warning for their spawn-ins. A particular level I got to the end of a twisting hall to spawncamp as they popped in from thin air.  -Enemy variety is decent enough and the two bosses you face are okay.  -The game bugged out on me several times. A few times was due to an enemy not pathing to me beyond a forcefield for me to kill them. I could climb ontop of an invisible wall (but not escape the map itself). A couple times an enemy got stuck in the level geometry and prevent me from shooting it.  Overall I would recommend this (on sale) if you want to kill an hour or so instead of blowing it on fastfood (this is calorie-free). Don't come in expecting a polished game that does something new or lives up to what it promises.",

Cons: 1) A bit silent.. some music during fights would have been great. 2) sometimes enemies spawn right in front of you, killing the immersion ",

            "review_text": "This game is pretty bad. Aside from the constant drops to 30 FPS anytime there's any action going on (despite my computer surpassing the reccomended specs) there are other issues as well like enemies literally spawning out of thin air, sometimes on top of you, or you not hitting an enemy when they're right in front of you (I suspect it's the character being close enough to the enemy that the bullets end up spawning behind them). Enemies have really bad movement animations and don't really respond to anything you do.   I'm also not sure why people are comparing this to something like Doom or Quake. One of the defining features of those games is the sheer speed with which you move. Here you move about as fast as you do in Doom 3 (maybe even a bit slower). It's not really anything like those games.  e: As an addendum, from doing a bit of research it seems like all the assets this game uses are stock Unity ones. So that's another ♥♥♥♥ on the ever-building pile. I can safely say this game is not worth $5. I don't think I'd enjoy this if it were free, it's just a waste of time.",
