            "review_text": "Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men, directly from the darkest recesses of the minds of the children of IO Interactive, creators of Hitman and Freedom Fighters underestimated, is a title difficult and inconvenient to evaluate. Difficult because it is full of good ideas unfortunately not always well done, uncomfortable because in these times of mania censorship and witch hunt, is a game that does everything to be tipped as amoral and violent. Stuff to embarrass any GTA. If Tommy Vercetti and Carl Johnson could be sympathetic in their raids towns, Kane &amp; Lynch on the contrary are the classic antiheroes, two shady characters sadistic and ruthless than any other video game or movie would be the perfect antagonists. There is nothing heroic about them, there is no possibility that it clicks a minimum of empathy for the two hardened criminals. In most hate and detest and do nothing to hide: their constant foul language is there to prove it. Killers and robbers without remorse, killing machines rated the massacre without respect for anyone. The beginning of the story is withering. The two are, from complete strangers on the bus that takes them to death row when they are freed by an armed part of the gang called 'The Seven'. Kane, accused of stealing their money, will take a few days to bring them back, otherwise he will be killed the family. What's more the flank Lynch, a schizophrenic tangled with slight problems of self-control, to watch him and help him in the mission impossible. From this moment everything that moves, especially when wearing a blue uniform and a star on the chest, it is shot down regardless. Traveling between California and Japan, attacking banks, skyscrapers and even becoming street in a crowded nightclub, all told by their voices and cut scenes made with the game engine, exquisitely cut film",

            "review_text": "Prior to my purchase of Kane &amp; Lynch: Dead Men, I had read, heard, and seen entirely mixed reviews on it. I'd been hesitant to buy it for this reason, however having now picked it up during a sale (a whopping $1.75) I was able to try it out. Having ran through the surprisingly short campaign (it took me four hours to complete, all within a single sitting, on the highest difficulty setting), I know understand why the game was so ill recieved by some. K&amp;L:DM is a bog standard cover based third-person shooter in its gameplay, and that gameplay is subpar at best. Most weapons I found to be completely inaccurate at anything beyond short range, enemies were basically bullet sponges (however this may be attributed to the difficulty I was playing on), the movement was clunky, and attempting to get behind cover often resulted in either awkwardly walking against a wall, or sticking to cover that you didn't mean to stick to. Your AI teammates also seemed to be pretty dim as well. This, at points, lead to very frustrating moments, and many undeserved deaths. It's still functional, but it isn't sharp by any means. Where the game does shine however is in its narrative and atmosphere. The entire game felt grimey, from the characters to the enviroment and even the soundtrack. It nailed the 'criminal' feeling quite well. The story was also quite good, although nothing I haven't seen before. Interesting (if a bit shallow) characters, and funny dialogue with more cuss words than a bar full of sailors propelled it forward. If you're willing to slog through the sketchy mechanics, then there's a good afternoons time to be had with this game. Though do as I did, and pick it up on sale. For cheap, I'd definitely recommend it.",

            "review_text": "*Insert the cliché 'I wish there was a neutral option' sentence* With some more polish, this game could've been a classic  Basically everything that isn't directly related to gameplay is pretty much great.  The story is awesome and gritty, the characters are fleshed out, the voice acting is very good and the graphics still hold up today.  The game is amazingly varied, which something that most games don't really have.  I'll be now giving some SPOILERS, so be careful. You get to escape from prison, you get to break into a prison, you get to rob a bank and so on.  But now the negatives... While the bullets exist from a realistic point, a.k.a. the gun, the aiming system isn't really configured to that fact and it still seems to think that bullets come from a straight line in the middle of the screen. That will be an issue when behind cover and shooting a sniper rifle. Speaking of cover, the cover system is junk. And seeing as it's a 3rd person cover shooter, it's pretty damn pathetic to see this excuse of a 'cover system' being implemented. It's an auto-snap cover system. So that means, no designated button and no real indicators to show which covers can actually be used. Also, once behind the cover, make sure you barely move. Otherwise you'll most likely walk away from the cover again and you might never get back to it. The gunplay is pretty awful in terms of it feeling satisfying. You can shoot some enemies 4 times in the face without them even being fazed. There's no real feedback there. The guns are very random in terms of their stats. The accuracy is the same on all of them. That meaning, the accuracy sucks for all of them. The game has a physical recoil mechanic, meaning that when shooting up, the camera also jerks up. Well, putting that in made them forget that an M16 should have a good chance at hitting a target at medium range when single firing. Well, there's no actual difference between spraying/burst or single firing. Only you deciding whether you can deal with the recoil jerks.  Overall: Objectively this game is a 3/10. It's easy to see the glaring issues and it's way below average.  Subjectively, I enjoyed this game enough to finish the 4-hour campaign. Subjective grade: 5/10 - Just average.  (All games start at a 5/10 and move up and down based on their pros and cons)",

The gameplay is really janky and a lot of the time when you shoot someone when they are behind cover your bullet won't hit them and just goes through them instead, causing you to either wait for them to move or you being forced to move into different cover to take them out.   There's a nice assortment of different environments and levels to play through including a prison, bank, a nightclub, the streets of japan and even some jungle levels late on in the game. I have to say actually that the nightclub level in this is probably the best nightclub i have seen in a game so far, it had really immersive strobe lighting and was packed with 100's of NPC's who then run around screaming when you inevitably have a shootout in it. Compare this to the clubs in games like Deus ex or Sleeping Dogs and there's no comparison, and this game came out in 2007 so that's impressive to me. Only the new Hitman game and the new Assassins Creed Unity has really played around with interactive crowd density.  It's weird though because the actual story about Kane and Lynch has had no effort put into it BUT the actual characters all have more personality than you would expect in a game like this and i found the voice acting really well done as well, i actually wanted to finish the game to see where the story went. It's just why and how Kane and Lynch continue to work with each other had me saying WTF!!!! Lynch is a psychopath who kills innocent people for no reason and then has a blackout where he doesn't even remember doing it. Later on in the game Kane has him keep his ex japanese girlfriend hostage, and without spoiling it you can tell that isn't going to end well. If they were brothers i could understand it but they just met each other and another character who you break out of prison even says he doesn't wanna work with Lynch because he's a crazy b*stard and killed his own wife. They have a character in the game who gets it! so why doesn't Kane? it's stupid and they could have made that way more believable if they just spent more time on the writing  I would actually recommend this game purely for the nightclub level, the rest of the game is ok if you can get past some of the jank.",

Obviously meant to be played with a controller, the mouse controls are as wonky as aiming with the controller, no aim assist, a protagonist unable to fire a gun only slightly steady despite him being some kind of veteran soldier/hitman.  Worst parts, however, are: a) mechanics. Protect someone? Dies without any connection to any current event. Get shot through a vehicle? No problem. Can also walk right through it. b) the AI. They're not just stupid, they also don't hit anyone with guns. Pardon, anyone but you. c) quality: you're in a car chase and it's entirely static scripted programming, however the diriver manages to randomly crash the car into the road. Yes, into. He's trying to submerge. Which may or may not also destroy the vehicle, outside of any control you may have over it. Lovely. Also, you may be able to trigger a cutscene you're meant to trigger, but you'll die in the cutscene and will have to restart. Rinse, repeat until the RNG that computes the outcome of a cutscene is in your favor.  3/10 for an attempt at grit through his 'psychosis' which only comes up when you're almost dead and repeats after the second time anyway. The only good thing is the game switches between direct talk and earpiece comms in a somewhat credible fashion.",

There is a horrendous bug in this game, it will stutter every 4-5 seconds at all times, the cause of this is USB devices it seems, I had to unplug my mouse in order to play without the stutter up until about mid-way when the stutter came back but less abrasive. Other people had to disable all HID devices in order to play, there is almost no help online, the publisher(Square Enix) rushed this port, dumped it and abandoned it, Windows Live is still in the game, but it didn't cause me trouble I just backed out of it and played the single player.   The multiplayer no longer functions as Windows Live is dead now, so don't expect coop or anything else the multiplayer contained, it's gone now.   On to the game itself, I'll start by saying the story is the only redeeming part of this game apart from places where the combat raises itself to mediocre. The game stinks of early 7th generation TPS. The worst offender is the shooting mechanics, the guns are inherently inaccurate no matter what you aim at you'll have to shoot it almost thirty times just to land a hit, there is a reticule on screen, but if you're more than 10 feet from your target, every shot will land around the centre of the reticule.  It's horrible.  There are other mechanics to speak about like the horrible squad mates that will either follow you and kill one enemy every 5 minutes or attack an enemy you tagged to attack, regardless of all the enemies in-between, they will march into a hail of hot metal for one enemy, and when they get downed, you have to revive them.  Oh and just for good measure they threw in some forced stealth sections that are instant-fail and can be failed by one of your 5 squad mates wandering into the enemy's line of sight, so, that's fun.  It's about 4~ hours long and only good for the story and some really nice levels, but overall it's only worth playing once.  Don't pay over €2 for it, if you really have to, keep it under €5.  That's if you can get it running without audio or video issues.",

            "review_text": "A painfully average and forgettable game that isn't particularily interesting or memorable in the slightest, as there are really no defining features that make  Kane and Lynch  stand out compared to other shooters. The game mechanics are serviceable for the time but third person cover based shooters have been done far better in more recent years and there is really not much else to the game in terms of features, it just feels like cover based shooting moving to cover based shooting throughout the whole game. The game's story is very bland and uninteresting, neither Kane nor Lynch are particularily interesting characters and the game doesn't do much with the setup of villain protagonists to make memorable characters and story. The game abandons the urban environments two thirds into the game and becomes another generic jungle military style game. Its also far too short; I beat it on normal in around 5 hours. Also, co op doesn't work because it has GFWL.  Probably the most memorable part of the game is an early mission inside the nightclub. You have to make your way through a crowded nightclub while using a hostage as a human shield, you're limited to just a pistol and the enemy gang members are hidden within the crowd and aren't immediately visable, it reminded me of some of the crowded party missions in Hitman: Blood Money. If there were more interesting or memorable segments like this, the game may have been worth playing but moments like this a lost in a sea of forgettable shooting segments.  If you want to play a single player crime game where you control a group of criminals and plan heists, play  Grand Theft Auto V  instead.  Kane and Lynch  is definitely not worth playing unless you want a short, generic crime shooter that you can beat in an afternoon and then forget about.",

This game also features (is 'features' the right word?) commanding a team, but it was not executed well, and I found myself having to corral my teammates in a safe zone while I cleared out the endless supply of idiotic AI.

Cons  -Weapons are way too inaccurate -AI is bad Most of the time -3rd person perspective is hard to get use to at first -Game is unfair during certain levels -Once you start the Civil War levels the game gets way less fun - Game is very unclear about objectives at certain points  Overall the game is great, not worth more than 10 bucks I would say.",

            "review_text": "After having played the entirety of this game with a co-op partner, I can hopefully give a helpful review of Kane and Lynch: Dead Men.   First of all, lets start with the pros. There's not many of them.   The voice acting was tolerable, especially the titular characters, however, there were a few side characters that were just meh.  The save point system is great. If you or a teammate dies (and you will, more on this later), it almost always starts you at the point just before you died.  The character exploration was fairly limited, but what little backstory you learn of Kane and Lynch is somewhat interesting, even though it never really gets used in the story.   And thats it. Now for the cons...  The story is abysmal. The loosely connected missions barely have anything to do with each other outside of verbal descriptions between scenes with no visual guidance. It really has a way of disconnecting you from the story. There's no gearing up for anything, it's just a 'we have to do this to get that' and boom, you're doing it.   This is more of a gripe than anything, but vertical split screen on a shooter means you will be killed by enemies you run right past because you couldn't see them. Im sure in single player theres not much of an issue but on co op we both died multiple times because of it.  The controls are fairly awful on a Xbox 360 gamepad. The shooting feels imprecise, always accelerating just beyond your target. Normally you could just move the left stick a little to compensate, but the cover system, which automatically forces you into cover, will cause you to lose the shot. It's just sloppy all around.   All in all, it was a decent co-op game. But if I had to play this alone I probably never would have finished it. I would not recommend this game, but if you really must get it, do yourself a favor and wait for it to go on sale. It's not worth more than three bucks. If you don't have anyone to play this with, then skip it altogether.",

I bought this game the year it came out on Xbox 360 even after multiple friends had given me bad reviews on it. Instead of putting this one up on the shelf to collect dust, I played through the campaign multiple times, and again even with friends and family. The CO-OP is a blast, and I really enjoyed the multiplayer as it was around. The multiplayer was quite comparable to the PayDay franchise, except that there was a twist; as you tried to rob the location with your fellow team they as well as yourself had the option to betray eachother. The winner took all, or if you did decide to work together you got to split the money. The multiplayer was short and sweet, but because you could not do much with the money, or beyond the level of customization it seemed to quickly face it's demize. Although multiplayer is now dead, the gameplay and story still make this an enjoying title for the price. If you have ever played the 2006 Reservoir Dogs or even have played PayDay 1 or 2, you are in for a similar experience. As Multiplayer gaming dominates the market, this franchise is one of the last I have seen with a truly CO-OP experience. Pick this game up... You cannot go wrong for the price!",

I was impressed by how they managed to create such violent and depressing atmosphere in a story about characters who are downright insane in a disturbingly twisted way. The game feels like it was planned to be actually big, but after going through rough feature cuts it turned out to be what it is, a story-driven cover-based TPS with plot holes and the most basic of TPS mechanics you can find. But the story and atmosphere is what deserves some attention in K&amp;L. Heard of the night club level? Or sieging a business skyscraper dressed as window washers? Give this game a shot. Seriously, it deserves to at least be tried. The reason I give it a thumbs down though lies in this exact Steam version. This is not actually a Steam version, to be exact - it probably won't even work when you buy and install it before you get Microsoft's Game Marketplace installed. I still own a disc version and can confirm that it's the same edition with absolutely no differences (except the MS Game Market is installed along with the game not making you confused about why it doesn't launch). For best experience get it on used disc or play it on your console of choise. Putting aside all technical details, the atmosphere deserves your attention. Just give it a shot.",
