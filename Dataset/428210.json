            "review_text": "UPDATE: Game completed, see below.  I like to start any review with the positives, so let's get that over with: the game's got two genuinely creepy jumpscare deaths.  The bad: This is one of the most trial-and-error horror games I have ever played. There are no checkpoints, no save points, nothing. You have no health; any enemy that attacks you will defeat you instantly. And any time you die, you are going all the way back to the start of this game. This is obnoxious enough in and of itself, but this gets far worse. Twice I have had the game glitch out and keep me from being able to move. One of these times was, no joke, about 10 seconds from the end of the game.  The story is nonexistent, and there is no proper ending either. The physics are strange. Just try using the numberpads that come up with a 360 controller. I dare you. There's a meter that shows how...in trouble you are, or something, but I have no idea if it actually does anything. It has no effect on the actual monsters, certainly.  The price is out of this world for this game. When you actually know what you're doing, it takes about 10 minutes to finish. That's if you make it past all of the trial-and-error and glitches. I am very disappointed in this game.  UPDATE: I managed to finish the game now. I ended up getting stuck at the elevator literally 4 more times before I figured out the trick to bypass this game-breaking glitch. When you get on board the elevator and it's descending, press yourself right up against the elevator door and keep moving forward against it. You'll hop off the elevator into the morgue room without getting stuck. You have to get on/off the elevator twice more but I was able to do that without my game breaking.  As one can expect, with no checkpoints and a consistent game-breaking glitch so close to the end, I still cannot in good faith recommend this game, especially as it is a consistent issue. I will edit my review if further updates arrive, but having to play around a glitch like that is absolutely ridiculous.",
