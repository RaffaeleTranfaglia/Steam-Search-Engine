It has awesome graphics, great music, but most of all the gameplay is simply perfect. There are various ships and upgrades, which you can combine in endless ways to get all different kinds of builds. It is one of the most unforgiving and awesome games ever, you will be killed over and over and yet you will keep coming back for more.",
