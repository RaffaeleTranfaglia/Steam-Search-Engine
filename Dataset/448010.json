            "review_text": "My Setup: Windows 10, keyboard, XBOX One controller  RePete is a puzzle platforming game for PC, Mac, and Linux. You play as Pete, a guy who likes to collect gems and has the ability to create clones of himself, aka RePetes. RePete will do whatever Pete was doing during the 'clone recording' process. You can have RePete stand on buttons to open doors, flip levers to make platforms move, and even go through the gate to finish the level. In later levels you can create 2, 3, and even 4 RePetes to solve the puzzles.   The puzzles start out pretty easy, with the first world consisting mainly of tutorial levels. But once you get to worlds 3 and 4, you are sure to spend some time scratching your head, as these levels can be devilishly tricky. Even so, with just 64 levels (for now?), RePete only takes an hour or two to get through all the levels. Fortunately, there is plenty of replay value created by the challenge times and hidden gems for each level.   The gameplay in RePete is pretty simple. For controls have directional control(left/right), jump(up), and lever activation(down) with the arrow keys, and space to create RePetes. I was able to use an XBOX One controller as well, though the button mapping isn't stated anywhere and is counter intuitive in some cases(B will advance you in menus, rather than take you back a screen).  The 16bit graphics style and sound aren't going to blow you away. However, they are very well made and fit the game style perfectly. I didn't encounter any graphical glitches, and only encountered minor gameplay glitches. The only notable bug was Pete getting forced into the ground by a closing door. Other than that, the game was mostly free of any unintentional frustrations.  Overall, I give RePete a 8 out of 10. It is very fun, undeniably challenging, and solidly built. There are a few minor points that could use polishing, but nothing that prevented me from thoroughly enjoying this game.   So what are you waiting for? Go play RePete!",
