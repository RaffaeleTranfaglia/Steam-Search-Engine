And now there's this very nice HD remake, with a modern resolution option, bug fixes (I worked on that, so I can guarantee you there are less ;)), the 2 downloadable maps that didn't work with the disk non-HD version, and just all the good the original game offered for a small price.",

Incredibly challenging campaign. Replayable. I have beat the entire map at least 5 or 6 times. Definitely one of my favourite computer games of all time and a strategy classic for the ages.  Avoid the sequel at all costs. It was not made by the same team, and is a pale imitation of this majestic classic.",

            "review_text": "Majesty is a classic game that I remember well from years past, and the recently-released Gold HD edition works flawlessly through Steam on Windows 7!   This game is unusual in that it is really a sim and not an RTS. While it is up to you to build guilds and hire heroes, once recruited those heroes go off and do their own thing - exploring, finding loot, and killing monsters. It is up to you to use the money you collect in taxes to build structures that support your heroes and make them stronger, allowing you to expand your town and your economy. Rather than issuing orders, you offer incentives, in the form of cash bounties, to entice your heroes to explore a specific spot, take down a certain troublesome monster, or band together to besiege a dark lair.   The game doesn't have a campaign per se - rather, it is a series of independent missions of varying difficulty. However, each of these scenarios is unique and tasks you with achieving a singular objective, sometimes under a time limit, other times without access to certain kinds of structures and heroes. You can also generate your own freestyle quests for endless custom action!",

My only regret is that it takes a lot of effort to get this game to work on a more recent system, and even now, I have yet to make it happen.   10/10, would love for a compatibility patch.",
