Awesomenauts with its quirky characters, 'saturday morning cartoon' art style, fast-paced gameplay and diverse skills offers a unique blend of accessibility, configurability and depth, making it an ideal choice for those who want to sink their teeth into the Moba genre.  I have to admit though, the game is still not a 100% balanced and for some characters, there is little to no variety in builds that are viable when it comes to competetive play. Be ready to be stomped by certain builds that excel on certain maps frequently. Nevertheless, while frustrating at moments, at 20-30 minutes per session, you won't have to spend too much of your time in 'those games'.",

            "review_text": "I'm sad to add my hat to the pile of negative reviews. Awesomenauts always had a unique sort of charm to it. It's likely the first online game I invested hundreds of hours of my life playing. Ronimo were also the first developers that I really wanted to support. I followed all the streams, bought nearly all the skins as they released and gave 50 bucks to the Starstorm kickstarter.  Unfortunately it's nowhere near as charming as it used to be. The UI used to have character and life to it and the devs kept 'updating' it by removing or streamlining features. The shop redesign was the first thing to make me raise an eyebrow. Awesomenauts used to display all the items in a vending machine kind of setup where you could view all the colorful artwork for each upgrade. It clearly had a lot of love put into it. The new 'improved' shop system was a transluctent sci-fi styled pull out menu with much tinier icons. While I understand Ronimo wanted to expand the amount of items per row from 3 to 6, they could have just drawn more space in between. There have been many other minor UI changes but that was the most saddening to see.  On top of the life being drained from it, I have a lot of issues with the XP system they introduced back in September. That was the final straw for me. I tried for months to play the game anyway figuring it'd grow on me. It did not. I still can't fathom why Ronimo broke their own game so badly. Snowballing matches happened occasionally under the old system, but after XP was introduced they skyrocketed. The solar drops and respawn time on kills were already strong enough ways to gain advantage, but no. That wasn't enough. Now teams gain buffs to damage and health too! Ronimo also stated their intent was to speed up matches that took too long but that wasn't ever an issue to begin with. My most memorable matches were longer ones where the leading team changed back and forth. Games are way too short now and it's much harder to have a match you feel was worth the time spent.  The XP system patch also needlessly complicated other parts of the game. Ronimo multiplied all health and damage numbers by 10 to make it seem like you were doing more. The problem with this is that every number displayed now has 1 extra digit. You can imagine how much this gets in the way during gameplay. I could tell day 1 that hindering every players view of the match was in no way a good enough tradeoff for bigger numbers. Sure you adjust to it but there was really no point in changing it to begin with. Reverting it could only improve on the issue, after all.  You also used to be able to read how much damage you'd gain for taking an upgrade but the added percentage increases with the XP system make this old method impossible. Instead, every upgrade now states the increase as a percentage. This isn't user-friendly at all. In such a fast paced game where you need to be spending as little time as possible browsing the shop, it's incredibly difficult to tell at a glance how effective an upgrade will be when it's displayed as a percentage. I used to be able to see that I'd get 25 (now 250) extra damage per stage. Now your guess is as good as mine, unless you want to be bothered to calculate percentages as your turret continues to be shredded. I don't need to know the exact numbers sure, but a ballpark figure of what I'm capable of dealing would certainly be appreciated. Again with time you could memorize what does what. However, each character added to the roster makes this more and more of a headache.  I sympathize with the developers. I really do. After putting in so much time and effort on a complete overhaul to the game's mechanics, it would be a colossal waste to revert the changes. That's the issue. Ronimo has its hands tied and can't as a company justify going back to the previous system. Unfortunately the game has to suffer for it. I had many great times with Awesomenauts but I cannot recommend this game anymore.",

            "review_text": "Awesomenauts is a combination of 2D platform/side-scroller with a MOBA (3v3), which creates an interesting combination that turns out as a very enjoyable experience for people who are fond of both genres. Like most 2D platforms, the main mechanics are simple and it's very intuitive, which makes it easy to learn the basics of the game. It's also similar to 2D platforms in how fast-paced it is, and how much it values reaction times. However, it also has some of the depth of MOBAs; there are several characters to choose (16 so far and counting), each one with 2 unique abilities and a different set of possible upgrades to choose for your builds and item routes. This combination results in a game that's simple yet fast and competitive.   In regards to some specific contents of the game:   The developers are active on this game, they produced 15 characters and 4 maps for the base game, plus microtransactions for skins (which doesn't have any impact on the gameplay itself). They'll be releasing an expansion now (currently on beta/early-access) and expand the game from that point on, so if you want to get access to all present and future features (which so far we know are extra characters, maps, spectator mode and custom-setting games), you'll want to buy both the base game and expansion, which is actually really cheap if you buy it on Steam sales or related stuff.   The balance of the game is not top-notch but it's pretty good regardless. New players might feel some characters are OP and whatnot, but once you get used to them you'll realise all of them are pretty much playable and none is 'game-breaking'.  There's a big 'luck' factor in the game. Players are not forced to play a full game and teams aren't required to be full to start and continue games (which means you can find yourself alone with 2 bots in your team vs 3 human players, although this doesn't happen often). Players are allowed to leave a game (although they'll be punished by losing ranking points), this happens very frequently, specially on losing teams, which can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ for both teams (losing teams with bots frequently have no chance of winning, on the other side, you can be on a winning team and new players will join the game and make a comeback). You don't know the map you'll be playing either, which is a problem because some characters have a bigger advantage on certain maps. You don't know what characters the enemy picked either. There's no separated queue for premades and solo players, which is also annoying for a lot of people.  The game netcode is p2p (so, no servers), this is annoying for a lot of players because you won't experience 'input lag' (any actions you'll perform will be instantaneous in your screen), but you will experience a delay in actions of other players (basically you'll see that other enemies will hit you even when it looked like you were out of their attack/skill range). This means that you'll need to deduce the enemy intentions beforehand and estimate the true range of abilities and attacks on your screen based on the player's ping.   Finding full matches is not a problem, and there's a decent amount of players online at most hours, so don't worry about buying a dead game (at least not yet!). There are a lot of players who'll want to play with you and it's easy to make 'queue buddies'.  The pool of characters is not as huge as in LoL or DoTA, but all characters have clear differences and they're all fun to play. Character synergy and team-comps are very important and sometimes if you don't pick your character properly you'll find yourself with a team that is incompetent in teamfights or pushing.  All in all, I think awesomenauts is a great concept and a very enjoyable game, specially for it's price. It's far from being a masterpiece because of it's issues, but despite that, it's a great experience and you'll have lots of fun playing it, specially if you play with friends.",

Tweaks to the balancing and AI will make this one a star.A clever spin on the MOBA genre that strips away the complications and nerdy presentation to create a fast-paced but deceptively complex action strategy game.Awesomenauts has a good and effective mix of genres: platformer, strategy and action. It also has a deep multiplayer with the approachability of a Saturday-morning cartoon.It's surprising just how well the MOBA formula adapts in a 2D environment, it might not be as strategic as others in the genre but it holds its own in terms of how fun the combat is. Special mention also goes to the sound design, very cool soundtrack and each character has their own little jingle, a small touch which I was impressed with, and on top of it all is the great voice acting which adds a welcome layer of charm to an already likebale game. Great concept, great gameplay, much faster-feeling and action-packed than games like LoL or Dota.A brilliant game that's well worth the small price tag.",

Does nothing to help the snowballing problem this game has always had, in fact it makes it worse because now winning teams can snowball on two fronts - a solar lead (allows you to buy upgrades to your character's kit), AND an xp lead for additional stat increases  Somewhere along the way Ronimo forgot about delivering a quality game and attempted to cash in on what little they've managed to deliver. It's a shame because the art and character style of this game is fantastic. Hopefully one day I can recommend this game again.",

I'm afraid that they may have to balance all the characters over again through their items and once AGAIN with the new EXP based system if Ronimo decides to keep it.   Snowballing happens too quickly, Premades conquer pretty much everything and Solo Queing I feel has taken a big hit in how teamates are now even harder to work with and ignoring minions/droids within the lanes.

            "review_text": "This is a hard game to love, but I do. I've sunk far too much time into it to say I don't love it. It can be extremely fun but also very infuriating.   It's meant to be a casual side-scrolling Moba / Dota-clone and it does that very well, but when I say casual, I mean super casual. Not caring about winning and game-breaking issues casual.   I can handle losing just fine and I couldn't care less about ranking. Being out-played and out-maneuvered comes with any online game. You play until you get better. What I can't handle is losing because you can go 1v3 or the drop-in / drop-out system forcing you to be always down a player because someone forgot they left the oven on and the next person just got a call, so your 3rd is constantly on their way to fight. Or the terrible matchmaking making you join a game where everyone has 300+ ping (yes you can set the game to find only local players but the player base is so small I've had that take 15+ minutes. And then the game is force-started because someone is too impatient).   There's issues involving lag even in local region games that have been around since game launch and continue to persist and will forever persist, because the game uses a p2p hosting model instead of a dedicated server. That cost cutting measure is simply awful and I've been dropped out of MANY games where the host decides to leave and we can't all get connected to the new host, sometimes resulting in the entire match being scrapped.   I've played the game since almost launch, contributed far too much money to the expansion kickstarter and bought some DLC I didn't care about just to support the devs. But I've also uninstalled 6-8 times and quit for months at a time because all the issues got to be too much.   I usually come back after a big patch rollout hoping some more issues are solved, but more often than not it's simply some unless flair added to the GUI and some balance changes which I can rarely understand the reasoning behind.   I've ragged on it a lot and I'm not giving it a thumbs up (in its current state), but I do recommend picking it up, maybe on sale and giving it a shot. Maybe it will have most of my issues with it fixed and if not, at least you can get some good hours out of it. ",

The developers are constantly fine-tuning and adding things to this great game.

With only fifteen (nineteen with DLC) awesomenauts, at most two lanes, and one less dimension, the game is more welcoming to newcomers.  With no dedicated servers, however, the performance is mediocre. Disconnects are handled by freezing awesomenauts in place, where they can be killed by enemy creeps or players. There is no way to reconnect once booted from a game, leaving teammates to fend for themselves with a terrible replacement bot. Force starts allow premade teams a huge advantage with 3v1s and 3v2s.

Emphasis on the was.   This game was easily my favorite MOBA that I ever encountered, until Ronimo fell for the trap of 'listening' to the fans. The frequent hotfixes and character stat changes have left the game damn near unplayable, taking mains or other characters you enjoy playing as and completely changing how they feel, even completely changing skills/abilities.  The last straw for me was not even the unbalanced Starstorm characters (which I backed on Kickstarter, something I now regret entirely), but rather patch 2.10, which has effectively turned Voltar, the only straight up healer in the game and a solid contender for one of the best supports in any multiplayer game, into a useless squishy blob with no pushing capabilites, no speed, no maneuveribility, and most importantly, an ineffective medic. The one mechanic that was changed to improve him was his increase in DPS for his Drone ability, which works- for anything left completely alone or an afk player, because his drones will actively target everything on the map other than actual threats coming up on top of you.  Buy this game on sale, it goes for 90% fairly often, but don't expect to be playing this game for more than a couple of weeks- the magic will wear off and you'll find yourself left with a mediocre game that doesn't know what it wants to be, and never will as a long as Ronimo keeps on addressing problems that the vocal few 'fans' keep bringing up, instead of taking a good hard look at the product and figuring out what needs to change.",

            "review_text": "Fun for a game now and again. But if you want to play a moba where the devs pay attention to what the players want, how the game should be balanced, or I don't know, care. This is not the moba for you. With the only thing resembling a competititve scene being dominated by 99c, and the 'Prestigious League 1 for the 250 best players' is a total joke. The game isn't hard, the queues and matchmaking are awful to put it lightly. Combine that with very few characters to play, let alone are viable. One of the 'draws' of the game is that it has a very low skill ceiling and a high skill floor, and is supposedly easy for new players to enjoy and play. Again, this is not true. The difference between a good team and a bad team is noticable immediately into the game, and has very little to keep the player playing. The unlock system is completely arbirtary. See, while other mobas like League or SMITE force you to play the game for a while to unlock the things you want, you get to choose what things you want. In Awesomenauts, you have no choice whatsoever about what you unlock. Are you a frog player? Do you see all of these fancy items and great builds that other frogs have? Do you want those items? Well you're going to have to play about 30-35 hours of the game before you can get to that point, oh and I should mention that you can unlock these things faster for winning games, which is near impossible with the disgustingly bad stock items. As for the matchmaking, it's total trash. The matchmaking servers matches you with player within 2 leagues above and below you. Let's take the average League 3 player, not outstandingly good, but still good enough to be about top 8000. You can get matches with anyone from League 5 (roughly top 20000) to League 1 (top 250). If the game can't find anyone within those 5 leagues you can be matched in, it will take literally anyone and put them in your game, for better or for worse. Now this wouldn't be an issue with the game, if it had draws to keep players playing (which it doesnt) achieving League 1 wouldn't be hard if it weren't for the outright broken matchmaking, and even then so few tournaments are held with so small prizes almost always dominated by the same 3 or 4 teams. The devs have absolutely no direction and little involvement with the community, the game is easy with little to no reward for being good, matchmaking and soloqueueing is cancerous beyond description, I haven't even touched on the DLC which for $10 awards players with 4 characters who are absolutely dominant in the current meta (if this game could even be considered as having a meta), the balance is constantly changing with every patch and the devs are putting time into things noone cares about, games are near impossible to win if you're on your backfoot in even the first 5 minutes, everything about this game is maddening to say the least. If you want a good F2P moba, go play Dota 2. If you want a moba thats easy to get into, go back to Call of Duty.",

            "review_text": "The game is incredibly fun. It is a cross between a Platformer and a Moba. Two of my favourite genres. The characters feel unique and the in-game music is fantastic. You can never get tired of the killing spree music.  Compared to other Mobas this feels easier and more fun to pick up. The item builds are more straightforward, so I never felt the need to look up any guides or anything. If anything figuring stuff out on my own has made me a better player. This is a bit more twitch reflex, fast paced Moba.  Since the matchmaking update, you get better matches and less ping between players. Though be warned that if you live in an area where there aren't a lot of players matchmaking might match you with bots as there are no suitable players for you to be matched with. I haven't had issues with this my self. But had a couple of friends who couldn't get a match after the matchmaking update. Mainly people outside EU and US have been having such issues.   Also as any other moba, people are pretty childish and will not hesitate to waste their energy to insult you. If you feel affercted by toxicity, there is an option to disable the chat altogether.  Ronimo is, in my experience, a very transparent company and has continued to improve the game through years. Sometimes it means they make a big change and it might upset some people, but overall they have continued to improve and support the game for years. Which is more than I can say about a lot of other more major developers who have abandoned their games and communities.  I would recommend anyone who enjoys Moba or Platformer genre to give this game a try. Base game is often on sale, so I would recommend putting it on your wishlist and trying it out.",

It performs adequately with the formula we're familiar with in team-based DOTA style games: you have lanes, turrets, minion waves, and a base. Choose your character, destroy enemy structures. Pretty standard stuff.  Where Awesomenauts stands out is in it's character. The art and gameplay transport us back to the golden age of 2D side-scrolling, bringing back memories of (insert your favorite 2D title here) while you savor the smart-mouthed slams each of the 'nauts bring to the battlefield. You'll find yourself addicted, and in short order.  That said, the limited community for the game precludes Ronimo from separating premade teams from solo players. What this means for you is that a match will frequently be slanted heavily against you if you play alone. On the same token, the converse is true.

            "review_text": "As someone who has been playing this game ever since it was released on PS3/XBOX 360 back in May 2012, I REALLY want to recommend people to play this game. There is a lot of fun in this game due to the 2D side-scrolling gameplay, which I find very interesting for a MOBA game back in 2012, and the fun characters including new ones (most of which is free) that roll out overtime. The maps can be challenging as cetain characters can take advantage of it. For example, when Ayla's Rage can damage driods under the area of top turrents (which I find BS sometimes) at Ribbit IV. Sentry's Black Hole Sun applies too as this ability can drag and hold players when placed under them despite some form of ground inbetween the players and the hole. Another thing I like is that matches are pretty fast compared to popular MOBAs like League of Legends, DOTA 2, etc. You don't have to spend almost an hour on ONE match. In Awesomenauts, the average match is about 15-20 minutes with the longest I've experienced is about 40 minutes (this is before the XP system).  But as I outweigh the pros and cons of this game, I find that the cons are  slightly  higher than the pros, especially with the new XP system. As some people mention it before, the purpose of the XP is to make matches go faster by creating a snowball effect. Any kills, whether it is creeps, driods, or other players, will raise their team level. On paper, the idea is great since in the past, there were some matches that drag out too long. As for execution, this is debatable. People who win a lot with this system will likely say there's little to no problems with it. People who lose a lot with this system will likely say the XP system is broken and unplayable. Personably, as someone who used to win a lot of games before, I can agree to the fact that this can be a problem. The XP system requires to have little to no mistakes when playing because every kill is exp points for the other team. Pair this up with the  WONDERFUL  matchmaking, those claims that this is unplayable may have some truth in it. The old system makes you work hard to gain a victory. The new system is on drugs as anybody, no matter what rank/league you are in, can simply win if one team is screwing up. It's subjective to how everyone feels about the XP system, but everyone can agree that this can be frustrating when you are paired up with team members who are either new to the game, new to the character they are playing as, or has no sense of teamwork or coordination. And honestly, I suffered way too much with that.   Other things to note is that there are no ranked matches, there is no surrender option, and there are matchmaking issues. For ranked matches, I don't understand why this does not exist since we have leagues/tiers, ranked points, and such. I want to play with experienced people without the need to go over to community and organize games. Not all of us has the time to go over to the fourms and ask if people wany to play. For me, I play it like a lot of multiplayer games: hit the matchmaking button and hope the team you are in is actually good. For surrenders, why isn't this a thing? If a game is going very bad to the point where you and your teammates cannot do anything but feed the enemy team, why can't we be given the option to surrender instead waiting for the enemy team to destroy almost every turrent and finally destroy the base. This happens way too often even though I tried to carry my team. I think we can prevent a good amount of people ragequiting and going AFK instead of waiting for the match to be over. If time is the issue (like people wanting to surrender less than five minutes in the game), then set the limit to activate surrunder at the 8-10 minute mark. For these two issues, it has been almost  four  years and Ronimo still haven't resolved this, or rather walked around it. Lastly on the  AMAZING  matchmaking, we can all agree that we had experienced being with bad teammates against very good players or being placed into a match where the team you are in has only one turrent left a handful of times. I understand that Ronimo is trying their best, especially since they are just indie developers, but why not just give us the option to choose a game instead of the matchmaking be random. Why not give us the option to prevent us from joining mid to late games randomly? This is infuriating because I have experienced this crap for so long.  It is also note that you lose more rank points if you leave a game versus losing a game (for those of you who care about your rank). While this encourages people to stay in their match and finish it (or wait till you lose), any disconnect is considered a leave. To be clear, leaving a game means losing half the experience points towards your league and unlockable skills (especially if you prestige) when you win a match. It may seem like an annoyance, but this is a warning for people who is tempted to leave a match just to find a game you can win in.  I know this is a very long review, but this is a game I have put so much time in since its original release, and only to feel like being stepped on due to these problems. And the thing is, I want this game to succeed. This game has a lot of potential to be a unique MOBA game that is diferent than the typical and popular MOBA games out there. If anything, I want to say that Awesomenauts is my favorite MOBA, but I can't. The game had undergone a lot of changes, for better or worse, over the years, and while it is not as bad as most people who didn't recommend this game says it is, this game still need a lot of tuning, epecially ever since the new XP system. I know the Overdrive expansion is coming soon with it promising better matchmaking. But as it stands right now, be very, very wary when considering to buy this game along with the Starstorm expansion. Wait for a sale if anything.   TL;DR : The game is mixed IMO due to frustrating issues, both common and personal, that has not been resolved or has been walked around. Wait for a sale.",

I wouldn't quite say I love it, but I'd say it's worth the $10.. even though I got it for 99 cents. :D  It's basically a base/tower defense game with 2D cartoon aliens.  I think there's like 20 different characters now, and that's exactly what they all are, different. Each and every character is unique. There are no 2 characters where you think 'Hmm, this one is kinda like that one' They all look different, and they all have their own special abilities. Pick up solar(games currency) or gain it by killing, and you get to upgrade those abilities. It definately helps to either read up on all the characters abilities, or have an experienced friend to play with you. What you don't know, kills you... Over and over and over. Overall, it's really a good game. I only have one problem with it. Leon. Leon makes me sad. No matter what character I am, no matter how upgraded I am, he finds me, pops out of nowhere, and out-DPMs me no matter what I do. Of all the deaths I have in the game, I'd say 90% are Leon related.  Get the game, it's worth it. Not sure? Wait until it goes on sale. But before you make your judgement on whether or not you like it, play every character. That's the secret, you have to find the character that you like and do okay with, then continue to learn and progress from there. Don't just try 1 character and say you hate it, because that's what I did. Learn from my mistakes.  P.S. Leon OP, please nerf. 9/10",

Being a pretty enthusiastic videogame consumer, this title seemed to sink into the background for me even when it appeared on the front page after an update. The thing that tripped me up was my conception of what actually constitutes a a 'MOBA' game.   Lateley people seem to think of MOBA games as stemming from some starcraft or warcraft mod with a tedious learning curve, an awful playerbase, and very slow-paced strategic combat.  THIS IS NOT THE CASE HERE.  Awesomenauts is a Multiplayer Online Battle Arena which pits two teams of three agains one another. Each player may choose a character from an evolving list of 'Nauts' catering to their own unique playstyle. Throughout the match, players are able to purchase upgrades for their characters moveset. Upgrade by killing enemy 'creeps' (enemy AI units which give gold, aka 'Solar') and kill the ever-loving crap out of the enemy team.  As opposed to a conventional MOBA like DoTa 2, there is no long farming phases, the shop system is easily understood, the mechanics are fast and tight direct controls, as opposed to clicking for movement, and the upgrade combinations provide the reletively easy-to-learn movesets with a huge bag of varied playstyles for each character.  The action in any given match is literally nonstop from the moment you rocket down in your jetpod. Immediately the teams rush at one another trying to get an early kill for a leg up early on, and everyone brawls making risky chase attempts and desparate retaliations. With every trip to the shop the scales get tipped, and it becomes very easy for a team to go from underdog to victor if teamwork is utilized.  As for the features of the game, there are several that set this game apart from an others I've played  Local Co-op is always a big thing for me. In my opinion, gaming is about experiencing cool events and challenges as a social event involving more than one person. The fact that I can play this game on the couch -conveniently, even- with my roommate who has never even touched the typical MOBA game is really cool!  The Art Style and character concepts are so totally unique, I can't say I've come across anything quite like it. This makes for a fresh new continuity with lots to discover and master!  All I can advise for those on the edge about purchasing Awesomenauts is to throw out your conception of an Isometric, slow, boring, grind-fest MOBA and imagine a gale-speed battle of force, reflexes and wits. Awesomenauts is truly the ultimate test of platforming, fighting, and skill.",

            "review_text": "A few things to expect if you buy Awesomenauts:  The matchmaking issues have never been fixed. There is no unranked play. You frequently get matched in to ongoing games. When the community is at its usual height (meaning not during a sale) you will very frequently get dropped in to matches that are well beyond lost. Quitting out and re-queuing will often get you dropped right back in to the same FUBAR match. You'll find yourself playing with bots against a premade team more often than 'naut.   When there is not a sale, a majority of the active players are very experienced. They will let you know that power creep has made many of the base characters pretty useless. Without Starstorm, you'll find yourself on the receiving end of a lot of beatings. There are a couple of base characters that see a good amount of high-end play, but ask yourself if you really plan to commit that much time to this game. The pool of honestly useful characters is pretty limited.  There are no dedicated servers. There are no region settings. This results in a lot of games where ping will be 200 or greater. You'll be stuttering around slowly while the other team ruins your day. And it will happen a lot.  I've not played with the Overdrive expansion, but I don't see any of its characters topping any leaderboards.  I've seen plenty of rumblings that the new XP system causes some real matchmaking inequality. Remember, there is no unranked play. The learning curve of any MOBA is pretty steep, and it gets much worse when you're stuck in a constant stream of losing matches with only bots on your team to teach you.  If you can overlook these faults, the game is mechanically sound and visually appealing. The original music is mostly pretty great.",

The idea was executed well: gameplay is indeed largely twitch skill based, yet most of the mechanics familiar from DOTA clones were preserved. Learning curve is pretty mild and the game is satisfying to play right off the bat. There is a sufficient degree of complexity in terms of metagame, so it's not entirely meaningless, but superior platforming skill can definitely elevate even the crappiest of builds to a point where you might be an asset to the team. There is also a pretty varied roster of characters, all with their own style and personality. On top of that, devs are still adding new content, which gives you incentive to come back regularly, as it almost guaranteed to feel fresh again.  The few gripes I have with it are not related to the core gameplay as much as they're basically inevitable problems that this game has to face as a multiplayer game run by a small indie studio and a (sort of) MOBA. One of them would be the occasional toxicity you might encounter in the game. It can be upsetting and annoying, but it's still slightly better than in LOLs and DOTAs. Matchmaking is another problem. The issue here lies in the basic reality that there simply aren't enough concurrent players at any given time to make the algorithm work well so the result is oftentimes you end up in very lopsided matches and unequal team members. The best remedium for this is to play with friends, that way it won't affect you nearly as much. There is also a huge chasm between what the most dedicated part of the community, those who play in League 1 and 2, wants and what all the rest wants and sometimes it seems like the devs don't quite know how to deal with these conflicting demands which sometimes leads to some balancing issues. But that's rather a minor complaint as this state never lasts for very long and eventually returns to equilibrium.  With all that said, Awesomenauts still has me going back to it and despite my frustrations I can still say that it's still ton of fun and I recommend it without any hesitation.",

Much like any other Moba-style games, or competitive games for that matter, Awesomenauts is very difficult to master. I personally have thrown 1000+ hours into the game and I'm still not that great. However unlike quite a few games out there which I will not name, it is very easy to get into the game and have a fantastic time.   Rather than spending the first fifteen or so minutes doing nothing but killing the creep waves and maybe some minor poke, it is completely possible to engage in a team fight within the first few minutes of a match, keeping it exciting for everyone participating.  If I were to rate Awesomenauts, I would give it a 7/10. The score should be higher, however there are some outstanding issues which I just cannot pass over, such as a Peer to Peer connection system which quite often matches you against players with insane ping levels, or the fact that certain characters can't make jumps that other characters can. However it is still an immense amount of fun and I have found that after 1000+ hours I'm still not bored of the game, do check it out!",

You will die, and lose a lot to inferior teams that have a lagger  - If someone rage quits on the opposite team, when someone else takes their place they are given a huge point bonus and this results in you losing 9 out of 10 times, it's very broken.  - Certain combinations are just unbeatable. There are a lot of characters that have huge burst damage, if luck has it that you are up against 3 burst damage characters, game over you lose don't pass go don't collect 200.  - There's a healing naut called voltar who offers indefinate sustain healing for the team, if he's on the opposing team see above comment.

In a word,. DO NOT BUY THIS S H I T GAME. DO NOT BUY THIS S H I T GAME. DO NOT BUY THIS S H I T GAME.  中文版本：  有一句话是这么说的：“陪伴是最长情的告白”，关于这个游戏，我差不多玩了有3000+小时，作为及其少数从1.0版本一直走到现在的玩家，我只能说，我尽力了，真的。  当初寥寥无几的那些人，大部分人还是盗版。但是我依然在为这个游戏的推广而努力。在看到巴西玩家一起写信给Ronimo然后出了巴西语言之后，我们以华人玩家的身份给游戏公司写信希望能出官方的汉化，游戏公司回复我们也许会在未来考虑这一点，但是现在由于技术问题我们做不到。我们表示理解，毕竟是一个小公司，不能强求太多。甚至我们有想过能不能和3DM合作一起出一个外挂汉化发给游戏公司，然后我就去和3DM的版主去联系了，如果有心人还记得的话，那个版主叫杀中杀，虽然后来我们闹崩了。然后为了争取在国内普及这个游戏，对于制约最大的语言问题，我赶在我某个假期的最后放弃了其他所有的事情在三天内做出了第一版的翻译，我一点一点做的英雄的详细资料，包括背景故事，基础的信息，各种技能以及升级的的解释 。并且在每次版本更新的时候都要去自己一个人去维护他，只能说我耗费了30%的精力投入到这个游戏上面，我真的尽力了。我不想抱怨什么，因为所有的语言在事实面前都是苍白无力的。  然后关于星爆，当时群里的人特别兴奋，毕竟按照官方的说明，应该是一个会让人为之振奋的版本，在线观战，回放，大厅，Workshop，5个英雄2张地图，但是直到现在Starstrom还没有完成，但是在这种情况下，Ronimo选择的是出新的英雄出新的DLC，出新的皮肤播音员。Ronimo你可曾考虑过玩家的感受？  我不想提游戏关于英雄的平衡是这样的：哪个英雄这段时间玩的人特别多胜率也不错，那么好，这个英雄太强了我们需要砍一下。对于那些没怎么有人玩，胜率低的英雄，那么好，这个英雄太垃圾了，我们要增强一下。你们就是这么平衡英雄的？？不过看了Ronimo的直播之后我觉得，他们也只能这样平衡了，因为他们实在是菜的一笔。根本不知道怎么样去平衡英雄。为了让超频OverdriveDLC买的人更多，不惜一切来加强超频里的三个英雄，我也真的是服气了。  在Ronimo的官网上曾经有这样的一张计划图，评测没法贴图我就直接复制了。 • Custom games browser • Third batch of Custom Games options • Online replays • Infinite spectator mode • Level editor • Steam Workshop integration • Starstorm map + song • Digital artbook • Backer mentions in the droppod area • New Matchmaking   大厅已经被他们放弃了。连一个简简单单的在降落区对捐款玩家的感谢，以及雕塑到现在都没有做出来。还有一张星爆地图也没有做出来，就更不用说观战模式，Workshop，在线录像。  之前想举办一个比赛，我去给官方写信问能不能给我们几个Roboscoop皮肤来当做奖品，我们想尽可能的在中国推广这个游戏，官方是这样回复我的，抱歉不能给你皮肤，但是我们正在弄简体中文，希望这样能帮你推广这个游戏，并且有可能后续需要你们的帮助来维护。当时听到之后很振奋，真的。在有生之年说不能定见到简体中文也不枉我这么多年的心血。但是随着第一次Beta的测试，心碎了一半。这垃圾汉化，一个大写的服气。再加上新的匹配机制的垃圾到不能再垃圾而且对于中国玩家强烈的不友好。我仿佛已经能看到这个游戏的终点了。  今天和Sauce老师一起测试了一下新匹配，我们俩150ping，但是2s一次红三角，然后一次红三角10s。这很王牌真的。  用一句话来形容，有心杀贼，无力回天。  我累了，仅此而已。  抱歉。",

The in depth upgrade system is extremely intuative and easy to use, making it simple to make some very stong builds for your any character, of which there are so many unique characters and playstyles to cater to each players needs. Although some characters do need a little balencing and these characters tend to be a little overused in online play, making you rage ALOT.  however that doesn't stop this game from being awsome.",

            "review_text": "Awesomenauts is a curious mix of MOBA / DOTA-like and platformer. Requiring more twitch skill than last-hitting ability or proper build order, this is a game in two worlds.  The art style is cartoony, specifically designed to invoke the feelings of old saturday morning cartoons like Ren &amp; Stimpy or Tom &amp; Jerry. Slapstick humor is certainly prevalent all around and many of the character's lines are referrential; they even have a few big name internet celebrities doing character voices (TB, Jess Cox, dodger, and Myndflame are the ones i know of). Overall the game is fairly pretty with interesting variations between the maps.  The game is very easy to get into as you level up incredibly quickly and early on most people don't know what they're doing, so you won't need anything but some good ol' Mario skill and common sense to get started, though i do reccommend playing practice mode first.  The gameplay is tight and responsive, though it could be a teeny bit quicker on the uptake. There is a drastic problem though; the game De-syncs ALL THE TIME. I have had numerous games where I was kicked due to severe lag and sync problems due to low ping. EDIT: the game is hosted peer-to-peer. Do not play without serious antivirus software and firewalls or you could possibly get hacked. The game also has no games lobby of any sort, automatically searching for a game to get you in. This exacerbates the low-ping problem as you have no idea how god the host of the game is, and it's very reluctant to switch hosts. This problem will get you unfair kills and unfairly killed time and time again. Ronimo, if I have any reccomendation, fix this issue BEFORE releasing starstorm fully. However, if you can get past that, there's a surprising amount of depth to the game. Each character plays very differently despite having only 2 abilities and a special jump. The characters all also have their own items, and you get to customize which items are available to buy at the shop, which is where a great deal of the non-twitch skill comes in. Setting up proper builds is daunting, so i suggest taking an online build to begin with, then working on your own from the principles you see there.  EDIT: A lot of people hav e complaints about the community in the game. For me and my under 20 hours at low levels, I have seen a few complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and one feeder, but overall people are quiet and react as you'd expect a normal person to; upset when losing (but not blaming the team except for the feeder, who was literally doing nothing so i don't blame him.), happy when winning (but only a few ♥♥♥♥♥ who spam the taunt button or act all superior when they win at league 9 [of 9]) and talking to the team only to ask for help defending a turret or something. I give it a community toxicity rating (with 1 being friendly and helpful while 10 being DOTA 2 or the youtube comments section.) of 6. More bad than good, but acceptable if you're patient and level-headed.  Overall, the game is funny, can be challenging, has great depth, but at the same time still feels like a beta test sometimes. As for starstorm, I don't have it and am reluctant to pay money for extra characters in any game, despite it being a pretty cheap character pack. One final thing; this is a paid game with microtransactions. On the other hand, it's only cosmetic (unless you count starstorm which also has an extra map coming and AI editor) so you decide if that's fair.  If you like platformers and competitive games and don't mind a bit of glitchiness and don't have a problem with the fact that if you want totalbiscuit Vinne you've gotta shell out extra real cash, The game comes recommended. I play it a ton and have enjoyed my time immensely. Using Nerdcubed's 1-3 rating system; I give awesomenauts a 2. This is without a doubt not a shining recommendation; the game has a laundry list of problems some of which can be fixed while others are the result of the good ol' internet community. I personally picked it up for 99 cents but I wouldn't have paid much more for it. Certainly not 10 dollars.",

The Charectors you can play as are varied and non of them feel overpowered compared to others ( well there is one or 2 that are weak and pointless when playing in a game against just Bots but would be very helpfull in online games) this helped the game become more about skill and not just about how powerfull a char is and what build they have.

Thing is, I had for the first few hours, but over time, as I came back months after months later, the game was no longer the same. While it is an addicting game in of itself, Awesomenauts doesn't have much going for it other than the music.  Quite honestly, the music is the best part about this game. Everything else is just not up to par. Matchmaking is probably the worst offender. While they do have a league set-up, the game tends to not even match you up within the same league. If that's not enough, even if you turn the 'find players worldwide' option off, you'll still be matched with players from Australia. Coupling the bad matchmaking with the awful, unbalanced Awesomenauts, you'll find yourself irritated as you play longer and longer.  The way that they balance their Awesomenauts is through a group of players known as the 'Betanauts' who play and give suggestions on what to change. While this may not seem too bad when you first think about it, you need to know that they alone decide the metagame. Characters that are unbalanced are likely to stay that way as time goes on and other characters that don't need nerfs will get them to the point they're unusable. Furthermore, the way the game is set up, it benefits whatever team does more burst damage, to the point where you can have a team that just can't challenge the other team at all because of the matchups.  Of course, that wouldn't be a problem if you could see who the other team picked and what map you were playing on. Which you can't, of course, nor can you even communicate with your team through a chat while picking characters. Furthermore, out of the 4 maps, only 1 is even remotely good as the others are unbalanced and make the match drag on for far too long.   In my recommendation, you should honestly pass on this game. While it is addicting, it's not very fun and you're more than likely to get irritated while playing.",

They all have a personality (occasionally one sided, but all unique) There are some gripes that I have though. Some of the DLC characters are slightly overpowered (i.e. one having the highest DPS in the game, excluding map hazards, available about every ten seconds) and the matchmaking system sucks. Leauge 9 players (the lowest leauge) often get paired up with players who are around leauge 2 or leauge 1. It's very rare to find a truly balanced match.   TL;DR a wonderful game with some minor issues. 8.75/10",

The community seems to be pretty relaxed and chilled compared to most MOBAs where players forget that it is just a game. Though it can be quite frustrating dying and loosing 25 Solar (the ingame currency used to purchase upgrades for your Awesomenaut of choice), the developers give you an enjoyable way to earn it back if not profit more Solar by putting you in a momentary minigame where you have to direct the drop-pod to collect the Solar as you fall deploy into battle.

Its upgrade system is pretty straight forward, on each of your 4 rows in the shop (utility, autoattack, character specific ablity 1, character specific ablity 2) you get to choose out 6 upgrades per row, however you can only pick 3 items per row so choose carefully! The game looks pretty great with it art like graphics, the sfx and music is great aswell. Every character has its own theme, which can be listened to ingame when a player gets 3 kills without dying,6 kills and the last time at 9 kills. The killing spree's are all pretty good aswell. You can either play this game offline vs bots and even splitscreen. There is also ofcourse online multiplayer. However, in online matches you will defintily notice how unbalanced and unfair this game can be. And not to forget the bad match making and a lot of lag, will turn off a lot of possible playeres. The community used to be good, however it has become quite toxic and some morons will make you want to ragequit and throw your pc out of the window. These problems may not sound like much compared to the pros, but unbalanced characters and bad mathcmaking make moba a lot worse and less enjoyable then you would expect.

Perhaps in the future it will be good but in it's current state with the funding and support it's got from kickstarter and most of the Polaris group standing by it it has made little to no meaningful progress as an experience  TL;DR: Not good or enjoyable enough for a P2P with DLC and Skins",

            "review_text": "  I miss this game, I do.    I understand my testimony is not wanted here, so I'll try to make this brief.  The game is a lot of fun. The characters are unique and interesting to play as, the gameplay sessions are intense, and the upgrade system allows each character some versatility.  The AI- mostly encountered in the Bot matches, of course, and also as substitutes for when a human player leaves a game- is very impressive. Now, this might just be because I'm so god-awful at the game, but I for one found the AI to be very challenging, and that it's easy to fall victim to them in an AI match if you let your guard down. If you want to play the game, but your internet is down, this game has definitely got you covered.  The characters themselves are very interesting, unique, and, for the most part, likable. I was particularly in love with Ayla, myself. Each one is fully voice acted. The lines written for and said by these characters are very memorable, and often funny. The vocal performances for the characters are also very well-done and likable. All of them are splendidly varied in pitch and tone, and convey emotion very well; and the vast majority of them are over-the-top in some way or another to help capture the, uh...  accessible  standards of Saturday Morning voice-acting from back in the day. Interestingly, these two traits seem to go hand in hand in each character- something I for one had long thought couldn't be the case before I played the game.  The music is great, as well- it carries that campy Saturday Morning feel, yet each track, and the soundtrack as a whole, manages to be genuinely interesting, and carry its own unique feeling- and catchy tune. And of course, in tune with the theme of the game, quite a few, namely the lyricals, have a humorous element. I used to listen to the soundtrack for hours on end without getting tired of it, myself. I found it great music for those hard work days, in particular, as well as for exercise. I'd recommend anyone reading this purchase the soundtrack, also located here on Steam, and place it in their MP3 players, as well. Of course, it's worth checking out the music on Youtube if you want to taste what you're in for; Ronimo uploads a few of its own tracks.  The Dev Team and the fan community is great, as well. Open-minded, yet rightfully scrutinous. They're very supportive of the game itself as well as of each other and any new members. They defend their own, too- I said something unacceptable of one of their well-established fans, they came to the user's defense and instituted the ban I deserve.  So, in closing:  +Fun gameplay. +Well-programmed AI. +Interesting characters. +Predominately good writing/voice acting +Fantastic soundtrack. +Great community that looks out for each other.  I'd recommend at least giving the game a try. Make the purchase, play the tutorial and a bot match or two; and let your verdict be made. I, for one, regretted maybe only a relative few sparse minutes out of the 161 hours I've played, and all of those that I remember were on account of the odd rude player or a bot name that triggered my pseudo-PTSD. This probably won't be a problem for most.  In closing, recommended.",

Combine the two and you get a peculiar mix that appeals strongly to fans of both gametypes.  The only real downside of this game is that it doesn't make it immediately apparent that it is purely PvP. If anything, the tutorial mission seems to be leading to a singleplayer campaign, but at its conclusion you discover that this is very much not the case. The game is ONLY multiplayer, save for an offline practice mode with bots.  From a personal perspective, I found this incredibly disappointing. I was rather enthusiastic following the tutorial mission, but once it ended and I discovered the multiplayer only aspect my reaction was a puzzled, disbelieving 'wut?' I will admit that I am not the biggest PvP fan, but my disappointment goes beyond that. This game's style and mechanics virtually beg for a singleplayer campaign, and it is tragic that it is absent.  With that in mind, I can still recommend this game to MOBA fans with a fondness for 2D platformers. It definitely sets itself apart from the slew of samey crap MOBAs out there without straying too far from what makes the format popular, all while adding some unique appeal of its own. If you like team PvP, this game is pretty fun. If you want a more solo experience, you'll need to look elsewhere.",

A game with simple mechanics can have large amounts of room for creativity, because then it's easier to learn, giving more people a chance to get creative. Although I don't agree with some of the things, like having a DLC for a bunch of new characters, and a separate DLC for a new announcer in the game, the bots aren't the most amazing, and limited as well. But the game can easily be enjoyed otherwise, the new characters are generally limited in strengths so they're not pay to win, hell, most of the people who get the DLC characters don't play all of them often. The game's still an enjoyable experience, picking from a vast group of characters with unique personalities, themes, and upgrading systems, rather than leveling up the same ways as everyone else who picks that character, you can pick your own personal upgrades for specific character abilities, as well as universal character upgrades that can mean the distance between being caught in a tight spot, or dying because you didn't have the gear to get out of said tight spot. If you don't mind a little bit of corny humor and movie references, I think this game is a good buy. Also, Ashly friggin' Burch!",

The five other plebians have to make do with snipe shots hitting three different targets, the airstrikes dealing death halfway before the tell's finished, other players teleporting and attacking without key animations, and their own moves doing diddly-squat.  Oh, and the game supports splitscreen, so you might as well Alt+F4 if you see the host consists of the entire other team. You've already lost at that point.  Play locally if you want a proper experience. The online leagues are something to be ignored.  EDIT: After looking further into things, I have to state that online play in the higher leagues is NOT recommended in any way, shape, or form. Cheating is very apparent, like Skølldir running at the speed of sound, Raelynn sniping through walls, turrets, and entire bases, and characters being moved against their will without applicable moves affecting them (not due to lag, though that's cropped up too). Believe me, I've actually taken the time to study each of the suspected characters' movesets and upgrades. I'm a very sad individual.  It's pretty obvious the coding behind the game is not up to the job of weeding out modded clients, which is very disappointing, much like its failing latency compensation. The game can be so ridiculously good, but it's constantly being let down by the ineptitude of its delivery.  Definately recommend to everyone!",

Overall I highly Reccommend it.  Now, as a SoloGamer, I Love it when Multiplayer Games have the option to battle against Bots, I have to say The bots AI in awesomenauts is actually pretty good, for a MOBA, They're Excellent(Or dare i say... Awesome)  The RunDown:  The Good: - Amazing Character Designs, (Vinnie And Spike, genji, Leon, To name a few) - Combines traditional concepts of MOBAs with A unique Twist. - Amazing Graphical Style, It's not Super realistic Graphics, it's Style is more Sort of Cartoonish, But Looks amazing.  The Bad: - Having to Unlock The characters in a set Progression(i feel this is Bad because going into the Game, Genji and Vinnie&amp;Spike were Two characters i wanted to try out, however they are the 2nd nd 3rd last characters unlocked) - Large amount of DLC In a Payed for Game, it has some DLC Similar to that of a FreeToPlay, But it's not FreeToPlay - A Payed For Game That Would be an amazing FreeToPlay Game, it feels like a really really high quality FreeToPlay, Rather than a payed for game, though i guess that chops down to my Natural Expectance for MOBA's to be Free,   The Ugly: - A MOBA Community, well, to rephrase, a Community that can be quite Toxic often. - A Lack of Maps (although for a MOBA it has alot, i just feel it requires a larger map pool.)  OVERALL:  I Highly Reccommend This Game, I feel it it is Definetally worth a try, If You Like MOBAs or platform Mechanics, then i Highly reccommend you give this game a try.",

Navigating space manually with WASD/Arrow keys or a control stick gives that deliberate sense of split second control. The managing of gravity and platforming will bring out all the old childhood skills of a classic gamer. In this way the game has a more fast-paced intense experience compared to your typical point-and-click MOBA. Each character has a standard attack that does not require cool down, always giving you some say in each second of battle. If Smash Bros. could be successfully made into a MOBA then maybe I'd abandon 'Nauts for it. Until then, this is my favorite MOBA.",

Nothing wrong, till you realize you need to pay for the mightiest characters and that you have to reach level 100 to unlock most of their skills (that really anoies me). Bot AI has level configuring but they alternate between dumb and expert players. Also I just couldn't play online from Brazil. It sais my 10mbps conection is too slow to join any game (that is, they probably don't have any brazilian server).  Despite of the all cons, the game has great art and great music / soundtrack.

Back when people weren't so serious about it. You just picked a hero and had fun on a map, killing creeps, pushing towers, buying items (WITHOUT recipes). Things changed all the time. There was no 'meta'. Just fun. I dunno what happened. Maybe it finally changed for the worse. Or maybe I changed.  Things got serious. Here in 2014, DotA has exploded, and spawned so many imitations, spinoffs, knockoffs, genuine attempts at improving the formula, genuine attempts to not improve the formula whatsoever, and even it's own proper sequel. And yet, very, VERY few of them catch that original magic. When it was fun, and not an 'esport'. When it was about the objective, not the kills, and about the nice feel of it all, not the rage aimed at your peers. Here's a game of fun. But don't let the whimsy exterior fool you - it can get serious. But only serious enough. It's still fun. You pick a hero, kill some creeps, and push some towers. And it's constantly changing, evolving. I'd say it's vastly improved today compared to when I started playing, and probably even more so to when it was released! I too may have changed - I like shooters now. I didn't in the Warcraft III days. Valve showed me the way, and yet Valve's own DotA 2 doesn't hook me like the first DotA and its ilk did back in the day, or as Awesomenauts (and SMNC before it) has done now. I guess I need that shooter element now - that element of accuracy and dynamic control to contrast the numbers and upgrades. But there's more than that. Maybe I'm just and old nostalgic fool. And perhaps it is only fitting that Awesomenauts borrows its style from the saturday morning cartoons of my childhood. But you know what? Those cartoons were fun. And so is Awesomenauts.",

The stuff like team matches, spectator mode, and replay mode should not be bought. They are part of the game, and should be added into the game free. To pay around 9 bucks just to unlock a game mode as well as other features just isn't worth it. You don't really see other many games blocking off gamemodes, and making you waste your money to buy a unfun game mode.  Yes it's a good game, but it's only fun with friends. I just wish that things weren't pre built, like forcing you to select what skills you get as you start the game. Once you chose your build there's no turning back, and you're forced to stick with it. Also the leveling system is a bit dumb, get to level 127 just to unlock one skill that you want. It's very lame, and not worth my time. Also prestige is worthless, it just shows a different icon, and no matter how good you are you will still be placed with worse players that are new to the game.

Awesomenauts is a 2D, side-scrolling MOBA centered on 3 vs 3 fast paced matches with a more casual feel than other games in the genre. It is made by Ronimo Games, a small team based in the Netherlands.  The graphics are great, as is the smooth gameplay (any latency aside that is). The soundtrack is very good too. The only thing I have against the game is it's use of peer to peer rather than servers. But for the most part, as long as you stay in your own region or close to, that isn't much of a problem.  The game also has a great sense of humour, with many of the characters, or their respective scripts, making reference to other games and parts of pop culture.  Your first few matches may be a trial by fire as you start in the lower leagues where toxity reigns and ignorance is bliss. But after some perserverance you'll see the community for what it actually is; Friendly, helpfull and funny. You do need to get to at least league 5 (of 9. League 1 being the top, as you may expect) to see this though. This is much easier with friends than it is going solo, but the latter is still capable of leveling up, league-wise. It's just pot luck as to who you'll be matched with if you decide to do things that way.  In summary, Awesomenauts is one of the best value for money games on Steam IMO. It is frequently on sale for peanuts as well, so even more value. It is constanly updated with rebalancing and extra content (it started with 5 playable characters and now has 21, soon to be 22 (5 of which are DLC)) and even has a complete rework in the pipe-line as far as matchmaking goes, so less being matched with people outside your region and league.   I think you should buy it immediately.  ",

            "review_text": "Great game, extremely FUN however if you live in Australia you will have times when there are no players and you must extend the amount of regions you search to get players. Sometimes you can expect 40+ minute wait times unless you do this (sometimes you might wait for hours).  Once you enter into another region, prepare to be punished for stuff that doesn't make sense thanks to lag. Lag means you will be safe on your PC but on the enemy PC you might be a valid target. This results in all players feeling that their attack was spot on and that the lag is the other player's loss. Then the lag attacks them for a change and it becomes 'the crying game' where lag is not as nice as you thought it was.  Much less stressful than Dota2 but due to lacking servers, expect to be frustrated when you are mixed with awful players even though you are rank 1. Expect to lose rank fast unless you have friends you do well with.  Update: between certain hours the game is unplayable. Having issues with people on wireless where their lag jumps from 185 to 600+ and somehow hosts disconnect from their own game which they are hosting. Then there are people close to the host that have an advantage over people far from the host because of the way their actions and updates are faster than those that are further away. Great potential for the game but lack of servers to iron out the spikes in lag result in frustrating gameplay.",

Now it is quite possible to make a come back from any point in the game, which restores a significant part of the competative outlook in Awesomenauts. So whats the remaining problem? Well following the release of the Overdrive expansion, the three new characters are dominating every round, even against players who are far ahead of them on the leader boards. Naturally this happens with new releases and it will be balanced shortly, as it was with the Starstorm expansion. So why is this being mentioned?  MATCH-MAKING...THIS is the number one problem with Awesomenauts as it has been since the release of the game. Time and time again you get paired with League 3-6 players against League 1-2 masters. WHY IS THIS STILL HAPPENING?! It is NOT complicated to put in blocks and balances for these type of player joins and match-making. I, and many other players I regularly play with, have recently dropped from League 2 or higher down to 3-5! Why? Because we are suddenly being paired with extremely low ranked players agains higher ranked players who join up, or simple due to bad match making. There is NO excuse for this kind of bad player matching algorithme in the year 2016!  RONIMO! FIX YOUR GAME'S match making before rolling out any other updates or expansions! Base team compositions on player's K/D ratios and League rank, and stop allowing high league players to gang-bang moderate to low players in order to maintain their ranking! It is NOT hard to do! If this is fixed the game will once again be great! Until then it is lacking, frustrating, and poorly orchestrated.  _______________________________________________________________________________ Previous Review: I 'DID' love awesomenauts. It was the best part of my day everyday after work. Then they rolled out the XP system and now it isn't any fun, nor is it fair at all. Here's why:  All it takes is a 2+ level lead and 90% of the time that team will win. Think about this logically. If a team gets an early lead what sense does it make to not only reward them with more solar than the other team but NOW to ALSO boost their damage and health, significantly, this making them even stronger than before?...It's insanity! Almost every game is determined in the first 1-2 minutes due to who gets the first kill and consequently a level lead.   You can be the best player in the game but if your teammates make ONE wrong move the other team will now have such a strong solar and level lead that they are neigh unbeatable. I've had SO many games since this update where I was the top scoring player in the game (We're talking 10+ kills to 0 deaths) and I lost, sometime 6-10 games in a ROW simply because my teammates made little mistakes in the beginning.  End comment: It should NEVER be as difficult as it is for a team to make a come back. This patch rewards an early lead so heavily that I can only compare it to a wrestling match between a strong guy and a slightly less strong guy, in which the game makers see the strong guy and delusionally think it would be a good idea to give him steriods in order to make him even more difficult to beat. They call that balance?...No, the scales are now tipped so horribly that the game isn't ANY FUN to play anymore!  FIX IT or I'm not ever buying DLC or playing another match again. 99% of the players I've talked to in game HATE the XP system, even when they're winning! STOP IGNORING US!",

Another thing: cosmetics are not free. You paid for the game but want extra cosmetics? Haha, no.   I'm sorry, but other games like DotA 2 and Smite at least allow you to play the game for free, get cosmetics for free, and get heroes for free.  edit: another expansion added, again costs money. I really like the idea of Awesomenauts, but this is not how you compete with free games which are handing out free items. In Awesomenauts, you pay for the game, the expansions, extra announcers, and skins! You get nothing for free. You even have to keep playing to unlock heroes (so even with the original game you bought you don't get everything). Either they should have made it free and done this (which I would consider fine, where everything else besides core game costs money) or they should have made every extra thing onto the plain game I bought free (or at least unlockable through playing the game).   I guess it seems logical. You want player to play the game more, right? So make things unlockable through playing.

Lately I have been playing one of the OP characters but even I can't do much against someone playing Gnaw who knows what they're doing, Gnaw inevitably becomes the highest level 'naut in every game I play because not only is he an effective melee fighter, but he has huge poison attacks, a huge AOE poison attack that sticks around, and he drops turrets which can be upgraded to be really annoying, and they don't even reward you when you die 3 times to clear them out of a corner under or above a lane. The turrets also allow Gnaw to dominate the entire jungle, constantly killing the neutral creeps as soon as they spawn or distracting the jungle bosses (the jungle bosses can't attack around corners, so they just stand there uselessly trying to kill the turrets that are next to them), giving Gnaw constant money and health. In short, his build isn't even very difficult to put together, his attacks require very little skill, and if you know even a little about jungling then you will wreck every game if you play Gnaw. My favorite character, Lonestar, was nerfed a while back and I find him utterly useless to play now. It is nearly impossible for me to get good kills with him unless someone else is setting up ganks for me. On his own, he is terrible now. I appreciate tremendously that the devs are constantly trying to add new things, but expect to pay for each new character or expansion. It is certainly not expensive, I've dropped maybe 30 or 40 dollars on the game for many hours of gameplay and I don't buy a lot of skins. The matchmaking system is also quite frustrating, because I get a lot of kills as Raelynn, my OP 'naut of choice, I get put with teams of complete newbies very frequently. Doesn't matter if I get more kills than everyone else in the game put together, having a team of people who don't even fight the enemy or don't observe obvious opportunities to gank will mean I lose nearly every game despite my tremendous lead in levels and damage output. Also if you go into Quick games, expect it to constantly put you in the same group of people over and over, and even the same games over and over after you've quit them. I've quit a lot of games, I'll admit, because I can't stand the people flaming, trolling, or playing horrendously, and when I click into matchmaking it puts me back in the same game. It seems to me like matchmaking needs just a few small tweaks and I would be a lot less unhappy. When matchmaking screws me I end up quitting, without any other choice, really. I have to wait for some of those people in my region to stop playing or diffuse into other groups of players in matchmaking so that I don't constantly end up with the same 3 jackasses. If you are just getting into the game and you know even a little about jungling and stuttering from other MOBA titles then you will probably appreciate the simplified, arcade-style gameplay in Awesomenauts. Games are fast, you don't spend a long time doing nothing as in other MOBAs, there are even maps that force you into direct combat before the creeps even spawn. Character powers are all quite varied, and can be customized so that they do completely different things, and there are a few characters that have different modes where they do a completely different array of actions, allowing you to walk into battle a harrasser-pusher and walk out if it having murdered everyone as a tank with a DPS aura. The varied nature of the characters means that every game is different, different combinations of characters obviously work well together compared to others but a lot of the time you won't know what your allies are going to be until you're already in the game, so you'll often end up trying to get creative to win a game against some people with a good combination of, for example, an assassin, a tank and a puller-AOE who set up ganks you can't avoid unless you never walk in front of your tower. The loadouts you pick before a game can also vary widely, and you can even put completely opposed upgrades in there so that during the game you can buy the items that make sense for a situation rather than adhering to a strict build, and you'll still do fine against people with an OP build sometimes, because you chose to be flexible. Lastly, this game appeals to people familiar with youth TV of the 80s and 90s, and videogames of the past 20 years. You will enjoy this game a lot more if you understand all the oneliners (there are probably hundreds) and recognize all the visual references. Some gaming personalities voice some of the characters so if you are into the gaming segment of Youtube you may enjoy playing as your favorite Youtuber. Personally I like Jesse Cox and Totalbiscuit as well as Dodger but I don't really like playing their characters, I end up playing that Yogscast guy, Lewis I guess, but his character's humor is up my alley anyway. If you queue up with a team you may have a better experience. But expect a much more classic arcade form of MOBA, and in my opinion more fun and still with a high skill ceiling (though arguably not nearly as high as DOTA).  Unfortunately every patch seems to make something really OP and something that was average really ♥♥♥♥♥♥. This trend has been continuous since day 1 and I've quit this game, I'm tired of skill having nothing to do with wins and losses.",

There are towers on each lane, defending the bases, and you choose a champion to play with to assist your miniature army and in the end, destroy the enemy base. Characters are unique and fun to play, and there are a lot interesting mechanisms thanks to the 2D platformer enviroment. The learning curve is very user friendly, nothing like LoL or DotA2 where you need to spend countless hours, days, weeks, even months to learn and experience all the matchups, get used to the itemization system and everything. You still level up, you still buy 'items' (it's merged with skill leveling at level ups), but it takes 5-10 minutes, a half hour top to get used to the system and the characters, and it's not getting boring at all later on.

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6.

While the game does have some positives, such as simpler matches, it doesn't do it any justice against the overwhelming negatives. The 'shop' system for in game battles for one. The game 'locks' some in game upgrades for all characters until your 'account level' is increased. Based on my first time experiancing the game, you can't upgrade your account level until you've completed the games tutorial missions, which range from killing an enemy player (A.I. or Player) to spending 3,000 'solars' in the games shop.  As for upgrades, you can apparently only choose three upgrades for each individual skill, something the game neglected to inform you on.  As well, where in most games you can see each skill, a demonstration of the skills, and what the upgrades are for those skills, you can't in this game. You don't even get a game countdown to prep for the battle, so while you're facing veteran players on your first day of playing (excluding the free weekend at the time of writing this, there are only about 800-1,400 players that regulary play, so yes, odds are you'll be facing veteran players constantly), you'll be at a loss and far behind others on your team while you're trying to understand the shop and figure out what to buy.  The characters themselves are very cartoony in apparence, and sound like they belong in a 1990's saturday morning cartoon, with very little animation to them. I think one character literally doesn't have an animation for anything. She just kind spins her entire character around.   In short, this game might be more targeted towards children, and definately not worth the money for your MOBA needs. You really are better off sticking to something like League of Legends, DOTA, or Smite.",

And like all profitable genres, it's being done to death. I hear they're doing a care bear moba. Anyway, Awesomenauts' twist on the standard formula is to turn it into a 2d side scrolling shooter and to pretend to have style by making everything AWESOME! with caps and exclamation points and everything. The art style is actually sort of good, but making everything AWESOME! gets old in a hurry.  As far as gameplay goes, the game is so close, and yet not there. The best way to describe the problem with the game is that it doesn't want to be a platformer, it wants to be another lame top down LoL clone. There's no real twitch factor in the game and ranges are too short for anything other than spamming the attack key and praying for the best to work. Characters feel slow, sluggish, and tragically underpowered.  Here's the thing, I want to love this game, but it won't let me. In addition to the bad controls, the MOBA trappings simply get in the way. Lane control, turrets, creeps, minions...they're all here and no fun at all to play against.

Let me just say for new players, you are going to get finger fked so hard you will transform into another creature from another planet. there is NO chance for you to get good. the matchmaking is trash. so trash in fact it makes my trash look like roses.  ok enough ranting let me get to the facts  1)matchmaking is trash, always puts you against skilled players with noobs on your team 2) you can't do sht because you are constantly getting killed and there is no support what so ever. your team is either at base while your turrets are getting buttfked or you are getting buttfked.  3) your team doesn't understand the fact there are two platforms and instead stay on either the botom or the top. no inbetwen. no switching. their mind is made up and you are fked. while i was defending the botom lane because no other fker would... i got spammed with voice notifacations saying 'help the damn team, we need you on the other platform' that's right, your team harasses you with voice commands if they don't feel you are a sheep - like them doing the wrong thing.  so you go to help them because why the fk not? and what happens???? THEY MOVE TO THE BOTTOM PLATFORM LEAVING YOU TO GET DOUBLE FINGER FKED.  this game is an abomination. it's not balanced at all, you have to level to unlock characters or buy the rest in expansions. (which are not worth it because you can't even get a chance to have a chance.) you are pretty much fked from the get go and the game doesn't care.. no... it doesn't give two fks. you are new, you either git gud or get rekt. no ifs buts or whys. no chance to try. you HAVE to be good or you are pretty much irrelevent.  i have only played this game 5 times now... and in that short amount of time the game shows you all of it's ugly sides. so dissapointed.

They all fun to play and I only pick the ones I enjoy the most. Most of the time I pick characters that i think would be best for the team. so I'm playing the game, Beating my Kill streak records and losing little bits of the games and I run into something that wasn't right. some of these characters aren't really balanced. I mean put it this way, If you wanna get a good rank in this game, You pick the most broken character alongside of other broken characters and there you go, Your climbing the ranks easily at the moment. I'm not going to put examples in here by the way.  Overall I like the Music this game has and how your character's theme plays when you hit a killing spree (if you ever manage to get one). Characters will sometimes spurt Popular lines (thanks wiki). Level designs are pretty cool, each has their own spice to it from giant killer sand worms to invisibility. Oh and not to forget the character designs, Including a russian monkey on a jetpack.   So if you are planning to buy this game, Be sure to have some friends with you or be prepared for the losing streaks. I'm gonna slack on this game and probably play other things. I mean this game has POTENTIAL. It just needs... more fixing with the characters. Oh and people who are saying its P2W? I don't really see anything p2w. I mean you play the game to unlock characters by leveling up, Also more in-game items for characters for you to change your gameplay. The expansion which you pay for only lets you have 4 new characters who are Actually balanced except for... well one who is currently being walked on in my opinion. Also you can buy skins for your favourite characters. So skins is p2w?  Anyway that wraps up the review. I'm gonna play a game that is balanced for the time being.      Oh did i forget about the Sour community? Well its a MOBA. Of course it filled with lemons.",

Awesomenauts has a perfect mix of competition and fun. Not to mention it has couch co-op. Lots of characters to choose from, each with their own unique builds. Tons of replayability and easy to learn. If you love the MOBA genre and find games like DOTA or LOL requiring too much of your time to learn, give Awesomenauts a try.  The only down side is the community. Like any competitive game, people can get a little testy when it comes to losing. If your team loses a game, it's specifically your fault. If you're murdering people left and right, your character is OP. If you have zero deaths at the end of a match, you're hacking.

Semi-Legit Review:  This is an easy to pick up 3v3 MOBA game that involves more teamplay in the long game then meets the eye. Fun spunky music and visuals make for constant hours of play time and fun for the whole... well maybe just you, BUT if you do have friends and a compatible controller, you can play the game in splitscreen... oh joy. The characters are iconic with hilarious, funny, or some other uplifting synonym backstories. The game is amazingly well price for the replayability, and amount of fun it offers. BUY IT NOW",

Your character's theme plays in the background and it makes you feel even more patriotic about your character.   ALTHOUGH, on the other hand there is a massive problem with lag and connection. Players with very poor internet benefit from this, as they can go around killing everyone and the people with good internet can't do anything because they just die without an enemy in sight. This makes high level play with strangers very hard, as people either have crappy internet, or forcibly create those conditions so that they can win more games.  OVERALL, when you do get a match with nice people, all of whom have good internet, then the game is a dream to play. There is a lot of variety and play styles between the characters, and individual characters can be played very differently depending on the loadouts you give them. I reckon this is a great game to play, but give every character a shot. You may be very surprised who you fall in love with.  P.S. Screw you Nibbs",

I never get to experience this quality, but I'm sure it's there somewhere.  The game is, in a word, 'fun'. All the characters are well made and have their own unique play styles. The gameplay itself is action packed and the fact that a remix of a characters theme plays upon a killstreak is one of my favorite parts. In fact, the only reason I don't like this game is that everything goes wrong for me. Everything. From the internet crashing( Which makes the game think you rage-quit and drops you back down to leagues) to the other team being incredibly cheap to the game not sending me a replacement player and dooming me to lose because of a inept bot, the odds are always stacked against me.  So I guess the fact that I have any fun in this game at all is a testament to how fun the game must be without all these annoying bits.

That decision was level up in match system(a lot like many of the popular mobas where for the match your charachter levels up in the match but after the match ends those levels are gone).  So what makes the level up decision so bad? Well it ruins any hope of recovery from falling behind. Awesomenauts used to be a game where a team could comeback from what seemed to be a defeat to just barely win. Now it's just get ahead then watch as the enemy team can't do anything. This also doesn't help another bad decision made a while back in which they decided to change from a set of powerups they could buy throughout the course of the game that would be available to pick from for anyone playing that charachter to locking some powerups level requirements which doesn't help that you will get in game with players at random levels.  So should you buy awesomenauts? The answer from me sadly is no, not in its current state. I hope they realize that these decisions were seriously detremental to the game, and work to fix these problems.",

If you took a platformer/shooter and mashed it into DotA or League of Legends, and sprinkle a bit of 80s Saturday morning cartoons on top, and you'll have Awesomenauts. It certainly is unique.   Gameplay  Awesomenauts plays like a 2d shooter, with abilities and perks that you can level up like in MOBA titles. Teams spawn on either side of a two-level map, with a goal to destroy the enemy base. There ist a leveling system in matches, but you buy and upgrade your abilities with Solar, the equivalen to match gold. This means it's a little harder to get 'fed,' as levels are more for lategame scaling than anything else. That's not to say it isn't possible for a team to get 'fed,' however comebacks are still possible. Even the tankiest of tanks can still be taken down fairly quickly. The turrets (towers) are impassable until you destroy them, which are difficult to take down alone as they do massive damage very quickly. Combat itself is fast-paced, and rewards speed and accuracy. Many heroes have skillshots which are incredibly satisfying to combo properly.  Features  Awesomenauts has a cartoonish art style that reminds me of 80s sci fi shows. It can be off-putting to some, but I find it unique and enjoyable. There are 18 heroes currently available with the base game, and another four and three with the two DLC expansions. Each hero has their own unique personality and backstory, and they are so incredibly different you'll never have problems telling them apart. You unlock new heroes and different skill perks by progressing through a skill path, which you can progress through fairly quickly. Plus, each hero has their own theme! I wish more games did that.  Future  Awesomenauts still gets regular updates, with new heroes and maps still being added. The devs even organize tournaments from time to time, with decent prize pools. The community is small compared to games like League of Legends or DotA, but it is still very active, and you'll have no problem finding matches.  TL;DR Awesomenauts is a fresh take on the MOBA genre, with a unique aesthetic and an arcadey but fun combat system. Although the player pool is small, it is still active, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a unique spin on this type of game!",

My only quarrel is that some (One) of the characters have quite a low skill ceiling, the only two that spring to mind are Derpl (Idk why) and Ayla (Well, IMO her rage skill is pretty OP).

Awesomenauts has a lot of fun elements: A good sense of humor, bright visuals, and a good amount of action. Each hero gets their own theme music and the game itself is pretty fun. That's the good stuff. However, the matchmaking is TERRIBLE! The matchmaking seems to be unable to distinguish experienced players from newbies. Naturally, it's frustrating to be decimated repeatedly when you're trying to learn a game. Also, if you think this is a fun game to play solo, think again. DO NOT play this game solo! You'll end up with bots on your team and the opposition tends to focus on real players when that happens. Despite its fun bright appearance, this game is not friendly to new players. Like many MOBAs, this game requires some study before one can expect to be competitive, and while you study you can expect to be fighting people who already know what they're doing... Yeah, real fun... Also, even though it allows controller support, this game's overall mechanics really don't work well with a controller. (As a big fan of platformers, this was very disappointing to me.) I originally bought the game because I like MOBAs but wanted to get away from the nasty LoL and HoN communities... you'll find more of the same here. Tired of seeing 'u mad bro?' and all the other overused memes? Look elsewhere then. That said, if you've played MOBAs before, have a fondness for platformers, are willing to invest more time in another game with a very steep learning curve, and will be bringing some friends along, totally check this game out. Otherwise, I would not recommend this game to people.",

There is a variety of maps and each Awesomenaut gets a unique set of 'items' that count as abilities and ability upgrades, unifying the gold / xp resource system into just a single resource to manage. Graphically, it is very kid friendly and humorous, but the action is satisfying for all ages. Battles are typically fought 3v3 and it is up to each player to master their abilities and work as a team to push their wave of robots into the enemy defenses, eventually destroying them on the way to the enemy base. I love this game and plan to try spending some more time with it.  Oh and, while some heroes are locked when you begin playing, they unlock VERY quickly just by playing matches and there is no need to spend any money or any ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like that.",

The final reason awesomenauts is good for you is because most mobas dont do a very good job at seperating experienced players from non experienced players, but awesomenauts splits the ranks up evenly to keep play fair. the community in this game is fun and caring, There isnt any online'chirping' and anything that does happen isnt tollerated.

Whether this is your 1st MOBA or your 10th, this is game is only to be played in short bursts or if you enjoy seeing who can play the most broken characters the best, and with that huge roadblock of frustration in mind, I can not recommend this to anyone who wants to play it for more than an hour or two at a time.",

This game isnt exactly balenced beacuse of the charcters and some charcters are just Over Powered to over 9000. This game is not relaly competitive, which rubs me the wrong way because this is a MOBA. The sound track is vary MEH.  over all this game is cool, and dont always take my word for it.

The game characters are quite varied, I've enjoyed them all, and I'm glad to see expansion in this area. I do, however, find myself often wishing for more arenas. The ones there are great, but more are desperately needed.  Other players seem much tougher to beat now versus when I first started playing Awesomenauts back in August, probably because I took a few months off. I also see a lot more players teaming up now than when I first started playing (either via local co-op or flashing the same clan tags). This teamwork is usually the key to winning, and it is immensely difficult or impossible to beat a well-organized team. That said, this game has surprised me more than once with down-to-the-last-tower-comeback-from-behind wins against overconfident teams.  I've had many good experiences with other players, but lately it's been not as good. I think the Starstorm expansion soured some of the community both by bringing in inexperienced-and-frustrated noobs and by giving people a scapegoat with an expanded for-pay character.  And yet, I still haven't met anyone in person who has heard of Awesomenauts. It just seems like a small community of players. Maybe that's because there's no 'search mode' for joining in-progress matches.  Finally, never rage quit. Be a good sport and finish well. Don't trash your teammates. This is a game folks. I really, really, wish there was a reputation system or other mechanism for avoiding some of the immature members of the community.",

            "review_text": "Bottom Line Up Front: If you have a friend (or 2) who will play the game with you it's worth the $10 USD it currently costs. If you don't fall into that category, save your money for something that will be a little more enjoyable in the long run.  Pros: -Decent mechanics. The way you build your character as the game progresses definatley matters and can play a major role in winning or losing; as can character selection. -In the same vein as the first one, characters are plenty and you can spend hours just playing through them to figure out what you like. Then there's the matter of finding your 'build' for that character. -Smooth gameplay. Disregarding actual latency issues from a player (very small occurence) the gameplay was smooth. Something that deserves mention considering there aren't dedicated servers and instead each person acts as the 'host' in a small P2P networked match. -Very replayable. Matches last for ~20 minutes. And from when you click launch you can be in a match in less than 5 minutes. After a match you can be in another in less than 3. During peak times it's about 1.5 minutes. It makes it a very nice game when you are low on time or don't want a huge time committment to have a quick enjoyable match.  Cons -Because there are no dedicated servers, the game decides who's hitbox is 'right' by going with whoever cast an ability. If someone is lagging and throw's a nuke your way even if you dodge it on your screen, if they see it as hitting you then they hit you. Some folks purposely lag their computer to get an advantage. It's a very small subset of the already small population but it's there. I hesitated adding this but since it isn't free to play you should know what you're paying for. (Funny side note: I once played a guy who in game name was 'I only lag in nauts' or something like that.) -You don't have access to all of your skills until you have leveled more in the game. It puts you at a disadvantage against the players who have been playing for a bit. It's a fairly quick leveling process. I'm almost done at almost 40 hours of gameplay. How quickly you level will depend on how often you win ... which feeds into the next and biggest con.  -And finally, the reason I can't recommend this game. The player base for this game is miniscule compared to other games and the singleplayer is extremely lackluster. As a result of the small playerbase, premade groups are in the same queue as solo players. If you don't have a friend who is in this game and you decide to dedicate some time to it, you will move up to a league where it seems all you play is premade groups who are on voip. They roll around stomping pubbers and have the nerve to talk trash while they do it. All of my games for about the last 2.5 hours of gaming has been this. The whole experience makes the game itself unenjoyable. At this point I'm trying to decide whether I should find a real MOBA or wreck my stats to drop down into a bracket where I find less of them. If you decide to look it up, you can find posts about it every year since it came out.",

This could have been an awesome game, the gameplay is nice and the characters are well done. But there are three main reasons making the game barely fun at all:  1) But the matchmaking is extremely broken. I had countless situations where I was teamed with another noob and a bot vs. two or three(!) Prestige 9 players. Today, again my first match consisted of 2 prestige vs a random+me and as a fifth player joined after 1 turret of ours is already destroyed, the game puts him into the other team as well, still leaving us with the bot. Needless to say, we lost. I feel sorry for the last player that joined our team few minutes before losing, though.  2) To make things worse, there aren't nearly enough players available, even on a saturday evening. More often than not you wait the full 3:00 minute timer and still join with bots, even when Player Search is set to 'worldwide'.  3) And because there are no dedicated servers, you usually wait full three minutes to have a game with 1-2 bots and a host on another continent, leading to lags and rubberbanding for everyone else but the host.  In conclusion, I think that point 2) is a result of the combination of 1) and 3). Fixing the issue with dedicated servers would take additional money that the developers may not have, understandable to a point (although a stricter rule for max. Ping would already help). But the unfair matchmaking could be fixed easily and simply has not been done for ages, see google results for 'awesomenauts matchmaking'. Is it necessary to put another joining Prestige 9 into a group of 2 Prestige 7-9s instead of the other team with 2 'normal' ones?  If you have a very high frustration tolerance, this might still be a game for you. For me, it's definitely not.",

Super Monday Night Combat has demonstated that a MOBA playstyle, structure, and map can work in a third person shooter, but Awesomenauts took it one step further.  Awesomenauts is a 2D, platforming, PvP, incredibly fun game, and I would reccomend it to new players interested in playing a MOBA for the first time or old hats in the ring wanting to try a different game. It's fun, well made, with excellent mechanics and a great artstyle. Some stipulations before going in: balance. There is a levelling system and Gnaw is so totally overpowered that having one of THOSE players will ruin the entire game. The sniper, Raelynn, and the tank, Derpl, have some individual issues that are harder to abuse, but still present. One map spawns extra flying bots that make the game longer, and another has a large creep that is somewhat obnoxious. Other than that, I would heartily reccomend the game.

Gameplay is fun and unique, but the matchmaking, and community make this a game I don't enjoy playing.",

Heck I don't like MOBAs that much, but I like this game, it's well worth the money you'll spend on it... while it's on sale no doubt. Oh, and don't mind some of the community in-game; There's naturally some bad sports here and there.  Edit since 2.13: XP system unbalanced things horribly. They killed the game.

The gameplay itself is action packed and the fact that a remix of a characters theme plays upon a killstreak is one of my favorite parts. In fact, the only reason I don't like this game is that everything goes wrong for me. Everything. From the internet crashing( Which makes the game think you rage-quit and drops you back down to leagues) to the other team being incredibly cheap to the game not sending me a replacement player and dooming me to lose because of a inept bot, the odds are always stacked against me.

The game has a lot going for it. Awesomenauts is much faster paced than your traditional mobas like LoL or DotA, and the active playstyles of most nauts reflect this. Each character has their own form of jump and 2 different abilities that can be augmented with the items you buy in the shop to do different things. The games artstyle and music is charming and gives an 80's tv show feel, adding a sort of nostalgia to the game.  However, the game suffers horribly from ping(lag) advantages, if someone's over 200-250 ping expect to be hit by abilities outside of their normal hitboxes. Matchmaking falters because of the low playerbase of the game, so people who aren't as skilled get paired up with higher ranked players simply because there isn't anyone else to que with.  Ronimo said that they were going to implement a matchmaking server to hopefully reduce the lag and other problems, but that was almost a year and a half ago (current date is february 2nd 2016) and we haven't seen any development on that front. Instead we got an xp and level system out of the blue that no one really wanted.   I'd stop playing the game, but I've made quite a few friends through it and haven't been able to find a seperate game that we can all enjoy for as long as we have this game.

            "review_text": "Awesomenauts is a MOBA. Well, sort of. If you took a platformer/shooter and mashed it into DotA or League of Legends, and sprinkle a bit of 80s Saturday morning cartoons on top, and you'll have Awesomenauts. It certainly is unique.   Gameplay  Awesomenauts plays like a 2d shooter, with abilities and perks that you can level up like in MOBA titles. Teams spawn on either side of a two-level map, with a goal to destroy the enemy base. There ist a leveling system in matches, but you buy and upgrade your abilities with Solar, the equivalen to match gold. This means it's a little harder to get 'fed,' as levels are more for lategame scaling than anything else. That's not to say it isn't possible for a team to get 'fed,' however comebacks are still possible. Even the tankiest of tanks can still be taken down fairly quickly. The turrets (towers) are impassable until you destroy them, which are difficult to take down alone as they do massive damage very quickly. Combat itself is fast-paced, and rewards speed and accuracy. Many heroes have skillshots which are incredibly satisfying to combo properly.  Features  Awesomenauts has a cartoonish art style that reminds me of 80s sci fi shows. It can be off-putting to some, but I find it unique and enjoyable. There are 18 heroes currently available with the base game, and another four and three with the two DLC expansions. Each hero has their own unique personality and backstory, and they are so incredibly different you'll never have problems telling them apart. You unlock new heroes and different skill perks by progressing through a skill path, which you can progress through fairly quickly. Plus, each hero has their own theme! I wish more games did that.  Future  Awesomenauts still gets regular updates, with new heroes and maps still being added. The devs even organize tournaments from time to time, with decent prize pools. The community is small compared to games like League of Legends or DotA, but it is still very active, and you'll have no problem finding matches.  TL;DR Awesomenauts is a fresh take on the MOBA genre, with a unique aesthetic and an arcadey but fun combat system. Although the player pool is small, it is still active, and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a unique spin on this type of game!",

OP character get even more OP, not OP character get nerf.",

            "review_text": "Awesomenauts is a fresh take on the MOBA genre, combining 2D platforming elements with the objective and team based gameplay of MOBAs. Unlike most other MOBAs, it is easy to pick up and learn, but is hard to master and requires practice and a well coordinated team to push and take down objectives. It features all of the standard elements of MOBA games, with the main objective being to destroy the enemy team's base while protecting your own. It features a large cast of humorous characters, all being unique and with a different purpose. The voice acting and soundtrack are amazing and fit the cartoony style of graphics well. Overall, it's a great game and worth looking into. You can spend hours on end playing this game and never get bored, even for people who are not familiar with the MOBA genre.",
