The controls are a bit strange at first but once you figure them out they feel very good. There are enough maps and difficulty levels to offer a casual experience or a real challenge.   I like that you have a decent asortment of weapons to use in either hand so you can have fun mixing and matching to see what works. I feel like a badass with a sword in one hand and a pistol in the other. It is very satisfying.  Edit/hightlights: -exploding zombie behind a group of normal zombies? raise arm to shoot over the normal ones and blow them all up! -dual wielding pistols like an action hero and shooting two targets at the same time.",

If wielding a pistol or assault rifle in one hand and making guts with a katana in the other sounds like something you'd be interested in, just click 'Add to Cart' and prepare to sweat your (gender variable) parts off.",

It is the subjectively unpleasant feelings of dread over anticipated events, such as the feeling of imminent death. Anxiety is not the same as fear, which is a response to a real or perceived immediate threat, whereas anxiety is the expectation of future threat. -wiki",

I get that everyone is different when it comes to motion sickness / vertigo, but I had absolutely no problem with the extremely slow movement. It moves slow enough to not upset gameplay (ie: you can't just race to the exit), but fast / often enough to keep the environment fresh. Controls took me a while (3 or 4 rounds) to get used to, but I prefer the current weapon switching to any over the shoulder ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Right now I can grab ammo out of the air and switch back to a pistol without bothering to look at all.   The only real complaint I have so far is the grenades bounce too much.   The only bugs I have experienced are:   1 - level 7 in the generator room - i start getting black textures and soon can't see even zombies. (Reproduceable - fix this please devs, I have a 980ti and am not used to having textures not drawing). 2 - zombie which won't take damage other than a grenade (but has his eyeball fly off a dozen times as I empty a clip into his face)  As for the naysayers:  You CAN adjust the tilt (maybe this is new, or maybe someone didn't bother reading the options) You likely can't see tracers sometimes because of muzzle flash (i've seen it every time otherwise) I agree the disc is lame, but hardly a show stopper I can hear what direction zombies are coming from just fine. Sometimes they take a long path to get to you, but If you want to complain about audio, why not riff on the fact that the fat zombie makes no sound at all?  $18 CAD is a bit high, but worth it in my opinion.

They just updated the game with better multiplayer playability so it's even more fun!  The screenshots does not show how good this game really looks inside the Vive. It feels much more alive and 'vivid', or as realistic VR games comes these days. Some of the best VR graphics as of now, in my opinion.  Choose between different guns during levels (all guns and levels are unlocked from the start), pick up ammo, HP and grenades with a gravity gun, or go total Deadpool with katanas!  Easily one of the favorites among my friends I've demoed the Vive.",

I get motion sickness easily and have never felt sick from this game outside of brain fatigue from playing too long.  Let me point out that the guns are the best I have seen on a VIVE game. The aiming is very precise and shooting two different dirrections at once and them suddenly focusing two guns on one enemy when necessary is very satisfying. Also, you can adjust the tilt of the gun in relation to the VIVE controller which is a very nice option.  This game is a must have if you want to shoot things.",

If you bring it up you have to move to an orb and it's VERY easy to be in the moment and not be able to look down and focus on exactly which orb to put it on. - More weapon types and add-ons would be awesome. Especially melee! - Aiming seem to be off and I haven't found a way to adjust it.  - 8/10 -   Definitely pick this game up if you want a wave style zombie shooter. The Dev seems pretty active and is adding fixes and new features often.",

Although there\\'s only 5 weapons and a nade, it feels like there is a variety of ways to play since you have the two hands. Katana and pistol skillfully picking them off until they get close, dual smgs just hose them down with bullets, you get the gist. This game has a lot of potential and is the most promising multiplayer game for the vive i have seen yet.",

After paying $20 for some other games that I didn't think were as interesting, this made my jump, scream and probably look like a crazy person while playing for the short time. As soon as this hockey game is over I'm going right back in. I didn't get a chance to try the new locomotion yet, as I didn't think the original would bother me after reading about it but unfortunately it did.. I didn't think I was that sensitive but apparently I am. However, that's a credit to the game because it's pretty immersive for sure so the artificial movement is noticable. ALSO, give it up for the developer.. 2 updates in 5 days with big changes. Can't ask for anything more. BUY NOW!",

Granted not quite the polished or stylized experience of House of the Dead, but it's still a very fun, full featured game well worth the $15 asking price. Whereas many of the current offerings for the Vive are a bit anemic on features with future promises of greatness. HordeZ is a complete and completely fun game right now. And it is also the best zombie shoot em up currently available for the Vive.   It may look like standard zombie shooter number 2,009 in the videos or stills, but as anyone can tell you, it's a completely different experience when you are in VR playing it. The zombies are suddenly as tall as you, lumbering towards you from all directions. But HordeZ is much more akin to an arcade shooter than it is a horror game. There aren't really jump scares here. Just lots of ammo and lots of zombies to put it in.  Pros: -Full feature set including 9 levels, multiple dififculties, online play up to 4 players, and endless mode -Great level variations with new enemy types on harder difficulties -Very easy to pick up inuitive controls with a smart 'slow locomotion' system (you are on a hover board) making it a lot more user friendly, even for those with more sensitive stomachs  Cons:  -the weapon select system can be a bit clumsy until you get used to it.  -graphics are a bit generic but completely competant and get the job done -Online play can take a bit to find a game sometimes",

This is a light-hearted and fun game (but also equally gory), it's like playing old school Doom but in VR, just tear through hordes of zombies and demons at whatever combination of difficulty options you would like. With or without a friend or squad.  The enemies and weapons are diverse (and the zombies eyes actually look at you, which is a nice creepy/immersive touch)  I hope the devs keep going with this game and make a whole trilogy out of it, would buy a sequel definitely.

Edit: I forgot to add, my partner screeched like some sort of strangled bird, and threw the headset off onto a chair. When she tried to play the training level.

I kept shooting power-ups, trying to pick-up zombies, and struggling with finding the right weapon when I really needed it. That's something that is trivial to do with a regular keyboard, so I really didn't enjoy it becoming a VR skill hurdle that I first needed to practice/master, just so that I could get back to the fun of head-shotting zombies.  I don't think this is a bad game, I just think it's struggling with the early VR learning curve and hasn't found an intuitive VR control scheme yet. As it is, I'm reluctant to show this game to my non-Vive owning friends and expect them to immediately enjoy VR zombie shooting.
