            "review_text": "Don't let my playtime fool you, I've spent more hours with this game than you can imagine.  I am a major Carmageddon fan and near widdled with joy when I heard C:R was coming. Like many I backed the kickstarter, participated in the forums, reverse-engineered the file formats and wrote editing tools so others could mod the game but still I felt, way deep down, that things weren't quite right.  Then one night, over a candlelit meal, Nobby broke down into tears and said 'Errol, things just aren't right. We know this and we'll make it better.'  'Will there be elephants?' I asked, rather breathlessly.  'Elephants as far as the eye can see.' he replied, wiping his eyes with the tablecloth.  I knew in my bones he was speaking the truth so I left him to it.  Days went past, days turned to weeks, weeks to months and all was quiet.  The doubt, the dread, the panic began to grow once more. Did Nobby really speak the truth? Maybe I was too caught up in my nostalgia to see clearly?  Then, one glorious day, the sun burst over the horizon and shone sparkling down upon Carmageddon: Max Damage. This was it, this was the game I had been yearning for all those years. The light-hearted violence, the purile british humour, the basic stupid fun. All there. Life was good...  I was on the phone like a shot. 'Nobby,' I said, 'this is fantastic. You have outdone yourselves. But Nobby, where are the elephants?'  *click* went the telephone as Nobby hung up.",

It brought lots of new things even to seemingly old places, New locations, peds, cars and even powerups!  It plays like old carma, it looks great, it has good performance, it is polished where it needed to be, It is the ultimate carmageddon experience.  Yes. No game is ever perfect and the list of what could have been is long on both development team's and fan sides. BUT GOD DAM the list of what is in the game is WAY more massive! That, my friends is AMAZING!  So relax, sit back and enjoy 1990's spirit of simple fun and cheezy puns.",

            "review_text": "  DISCLAIMER: I, and every other consumer who purchased 'Carmageddon: Reincarnation' have recieved this product for free. Carmageddon: Reincarnation was a failure. It was buggy, very poorly optimized, and rough all around, and it had gotten to the point where the Carma: Re brand was tarnished. So, after several somewhat effective, yet still failed attempts at bringing the game to its fullest potential, Stainless Games made a great business decision and took a year away to copy and paste Carmageddon: Reincarnation into a new project, optimize it beyond all belief, polish it, add new creative content content, fix bugs, and turn it into the game we expected to recieve when we purchased Carmageddon: Reincarnation. Stainless games certainly redeemed themselves, and I thank you guys for this great game!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  There's a common criticism that this game is not a 2016 game or 'it belongs in 1999'. I think that criticism is somewhat unfair, though partially true. I don't think Stainless Games should have heavily modernized this game. I think they did a great job at bringing back an old game with fresh graphics, mechanics, and content. Is the formula a bit dated by today's standards? Kind of, but I love it just the way it is, and it's a great, full experience that was crafted to revive old memories with a fresh coat of paint and some new toys to play with. Also, there's no corporate bull crap going on. No annoying microtransactions, no 'Supply Drops', no insulting DLC practices, and when Carma: Re failed, Stainless Games did not abandon it or make half-a$$ed attempts at dodging negative PR. No, they worked all day and night and brought us what we asked for in Reincarnation, and took some of the loss by giving us owners of the failed game a new product. Now THIS is what a great development team looks like. Take notes, 'Early Access Randomly-Generated Open World Survival Sandbox #9540271620100698953210192' scrubs.. If you loved the old Carma games, or you love entertainment with little story, offensive humor, and epic action, pick this up, and you just might be one of those people that this game caters to. ;)",

Smooth gameplay, with not a single stutter on i7 3770 and GTX970 - no crappy port, or a port done right! Side Note: the draw distance seems closer in comparison to Reincarnation and some objects do pop up too near sometimes even on maxed settings. Food for thought in terms of code optimization or whatever the devs claim to have done.   Good feeling of the cars, some more driveable than others, slightly challenging and just enough to get the satisfaction of running people over with a motor vehicle but still be comfortable with a keyboard!   And the tank. Don't forget the tank! Once you unlock it, Blitzkrieger has never been so fun to drive as it is now. Especially with the pink camo paint job :)   Fair challenge on Normal difficulty - sometimes requires a bit of planning, like selecting the right car to fit the event, looking at the map of the level from time to time by pressing Tab to get oriented in the environment but still easy enough while played after a hard day as a stress relief.   Catchy and themed levels + even aliens to run over!  Silly jokes, murder, destruction, and Oxford comma.   Just like it used to be in the late 90s or early 2000s but updated here and there.  Still Carma, no tons of DLC, no saving the world, no two-thirds of game budget spent on marketing. Period.",

A lot is improved over Carmageddon: Reincarnation, not just the obvious things like the extra vehicles and environments but there are subtle changes to nearly all of the game that make it a much more fun experience.  Performance is top notch this time around, graphically it isn't the prettiest game out there but this is an indie title, Stainless no longer have a big publisher throwing money at the franchise but despite that it still offers some very impressive tech, vehicle deformation, tracked vehicles and vehicle suspension are as always, extremely fleshed out and realistic.  Best of all, IT IS A FUN GAME THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE FUN AND IS FUN and there aren't enough of those around these days, stop being a serious nancy with your whinings about social justice and your pants not being gender fluid and play some Carmageddon, it is fun and will probably offend you no matter who you vote for.   EDIT: Just for the silly buggers among you out there who believe everything they read on the internet as genuine, the first line (mentioning SCI) is obviously a joke, in fact it is a running joke based on all of the backlash that C:R originally received, sod off and just enjoy the game.",

And if I understand correctly this is free if you had purchaced reincarnation earlier. I'm loving this way more than I should, car physics can bug out sometimes, keyboard controls aren't quite as crispy as they were in Carmageddon 2, but it's still fun and with controller it gets even better.  I was actually fine with reincarnation after the last few patches that brought performance to the level I could play it with my R9-290X with steady 50-60fps 1080p, but after getting this superior version (witch actually runs steady 60fps with that same R9 @ 1600p) for free I've pretty much forgiven Stainless for the mess reincarnation was on launch, tough I'm still not going to kickstart or preorder their games ;)",

Thanks for this.  And now to the review - the game is just like the original (or as close as one can get (I mean the real originial Carmageddon which ran on DOS Systems)), just with better graphics.  Nice cars, nice routes and nice cows to splatter.

Five minutes into the first race and i'm already wearing a wicked smile, grinning as I mow down peds and smash fatally into the oppenents. And after a countless number of matches, it's still as fun as it was in the beginning.  This is  not  another crappy mainstreamed title, its a true remake with better visuals, sounds and gameplay tweaks. Still true to the Carmageddon spirit. Will highly recommend this to anyone who loved the classics or just like some good car carnage. There are, of course, both pros and cons which i'll try to highlight below. All in all, the good outshines the bad by far.  Pros - Solid performance (win10pro) - Almost no bugs at all - Good selection of Cars - Huge maps filled with secrets - Solid career and freeplay mode - Over-the-top gore and humor - Insane amount of PUps - Loads of secrets to unlock - Mini story involving cows.. and penguins.. cowguins..? Possibly also aliens.. and some sort of cookie factory, dunno..  Cons - Low game sound (commen bug) - Occasional CTD - Secrets/unlocks are a mess and hard to keep track of  Important note: The game may crash and/or refuse to launch for anyone running older versions of Microsoft Windows with specific updates. This also seem to be a problem for dual core users. Please consult the forum first if you think this may regard you.",

            "review_text": "So... Welcome to the least politically correct driving game around, probably. Short version: If you're looking for a racing game with few rules, many blood stains, low-brow comedy and unplanned comedy, you probably want to give this a go. Good enough graphics &amp; sound, varied selection of cars to get (with some cool new ones to go along the classics that have always been there), tight controls (highly depending on the vehicle you drive, some aren't designed to be controllable), and more than enough people and livestock to run over for bonus points.  Also, a bunch of different game modes for variety, a reason to explore the maps (that's now how you get the tokens you need for vehicle upgades),  TL;DR wall of text version: First, there was Carmageddon. A fun little racing game where you get to roam a wide map to pick your own shortest route to the checkpoints, thus completing laps to win the race. Or, you know, you could just total your opponents instead and be the last one standing. That works too. Oh. And beware of the pedestrians along the track. They're worth points if you make them go SPLAT! and you'll need those points to pay for repairs &amp; stuff. As added bonus, splatting the last ped on the map is another way to be declared winner. For some reason, that 'More pedestrians equals more points!' bit caused a bit of controversy as well.  Then came Carmageddon 2. Which was technically superior to the first in many ways, and was every bit as nuts. It also introduced some godawful timed &amp; scripted missions to ♥♥♥♥ people off until they track down the cheat codes to skip those. Hum. I suppose that's the risk of trying to innovate, sometimes what sounds like a good idea doesn't really work out in the end.  Next up, Carmageddon TDR2000. Which introduces crazier vehicles (yay!), messes up the driving physics (boo!) and has pretty much every stage be a timed &amp; scripted mission, thus repeating Carma 2's big mistake several times over (WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS? ARGH!). Suffice to say, this is the black sheep of the series. And that came out back in 2000, after which the series pretty much died.  Until about 15 years later, when the aptly-subtitled Carmageddon: Reincarnation brought things back to life. (That's not counting a fairly troubled Early Access period; the early builds were in all honesty complete ♥♥♥♥ in terms of performance and general feel, and the game wasn't really playable until a massive overhaul shortly before release sorted out the biggest issues) The official release version was still rough, but playable and enjoyable enough to bring back the happy days of driving like a maniac and unleashing the Pedestrian Electro-♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Ray on unsuspecting crowds. All in all, not stellar, but it did prove the general idea is still valid in this day and age.  It got a bunch of updates along the way, and then promptly disappeared from the digital stores where it was sold. That's because for console release, there was this updated version titled 'Carmageddon: Max Damage'. With more spit &amp; polish and stuff. So the devs decided that should replace Reincarnation on Steam as well.  With all the work put into it by now, this really is a worthy successor to 1 &amp; 2, and it's a perfect game to just pick up &amp; play for some relaxing mindless violence.  ",

Just doesn't feel good - Physics feel like your car was super light and doesn't have real punch when crashing - Damage doesn't affect car handling at all - Way too easy. You can't lose even on hard - AI is stupid. When they want to crash into you, they just keep driving against you instead of driving away and coming back with force. All the AI just clumps up in a big pile sometimes - Weird credits/unlock system  Didn't try multiplayer since I wanted this game for SP.  I had to refund it. Sad, I loved the original Carmageddon",

From severe performance issues, to annoying and incompetent AI, to a handling model that simply doesnt work, to bad map design.  The game also tries too hard to be comical, using forced jokes which keep on repeating themselves. It simply does not work.  A much better use of your money would be to buy Carmageddon 2.",

Basically everytime you come to an easy 45 degree turn which should be simple to drive around you can't without first using the handbrake to make it, or start planning the turn from 10 metres away at a slow-ish pace. Everything else is fine but so what if you can't enjoy it.",

Easy mode? 4. no traffic. 5. the new game modes extremely boring. i remember enjoying time trials in the previous carma games very much, so what happened with that? 6. cell shading on barrels is unnecessary. 7. encountered bad level design on the small map when underwater. 8. CONSTANT CRASHES ON RELEASE ARE NOT ACCAPTABLE! 9. No special missions. i PASSED 3 SETS of STAGES AND ALL I COULD FIND are those silly new regimes. 10. Overall dissapointment realizing that this 'game' has nothing to do with the reall carma! 11. No tech support whatsoever. mails ignored, forums ignored. 12. Past the middle of the game and already bored to death with the repetative missions... Positive: i couldnt think of anything. The graphics is avarage. Everything is avarage.",
