            "review_text": "BOTTOM LINE: If you are easily immersed in games then you will definitly enjoy this. Even though it is a point and click, you will still feel this underlying feeling of terror as the game slowly reveals what's happening piece by piece. If you just want to dip your toes into the genre this is a great place to start. I'd give it a 7/10.  ------------------------------------------------  If its on sale or you have cash that you feel like spending, grab it for sure. If you only have a $10 net worth, you could probably find better uses for that money.  They got the puzzle aspect right in this one. While most games haphazardly throw together 'puzzles' in the form of 'move the blocks in order', this game actually involves more thinking than most. They aren't that difficult, but will provide some satisfaction when you figure them out. A great thing I found with the puzzles is that they aren't frustrating in anyway, so you won't mind taking the time to solve them.  The worst thing I can say about this is that the navigation is rough, your character turns,flips,and cartwheels all over the place and it can leave you disoriented. After I figure out where I need to go, I have to rely heavily on the 'hint' button to point me to the correct doors; otherwise I'd end up going in a several circles.  I haven't beaten it yet when I'm writing this, but I'm definitely excited (and hesitant :p) to get back into it to reveal more of the story. I picked this up looking for something to do youtube videos on, and it has delivered.  (**Plus the publishers were more than willing to let me record and monetize let's plays after I EMAILED THEM FIRST.)",

I only felt fairly creeped out twice, but the feeling didn't last more than some 30 seconds.  It's a good time killer for a few cents, but overall I wouldn't really recommend this. A horror game that fails to create tension is hardly recommendable.",

Voice Acting: 10/10 The little voice over in the game is very nice, a little odd that it doesn't carry over into the small 'scenes' you have throughout the game but still good job.  Gameplay: 7/10 It's a point and click! Kind of an odd sort of a game to come out of the woodwork. However, there are a bunch of puzzles which are my favorite sort of game, so I'm biased, however it's a little short for the price. I also like how it isn't filled with achievements. You play the game, maybe grab a few coins if you can while you sort out the puzzles and you have fun. It's about 3 hours a good thing to do in your spare time. I enjoyed it.  Price: No. just no. I got this game on sale for 1 dollar. Get this game on sale if you can.",

            "review_text": "The game is moderate at best. Buy only with caution, discounted if at all.  The homage to Resident Evil and Silent Hill is, if at all, only tenable in regards to the story development. And even here the game underperforms, with its short duration its over just when you figured out what is happening. Visuals are only okay either, preredered backgrounds that are not even up to current resolution standards. There is simply nothing really outstanding or gratifying about it, sadly.  Whilst the game tries hard to invoke a sense of dread it unfortunately falls short of anything that really invokes a fealing of scaryness or anxiety. As a point and click adventure it may be a good entrance for absolute beginners and people who never played a horror game before but the current price of 10 bucks is nowhere nearly justified with less than 3 hours to beat all three chapters.",

            "review_text": "Decay really isn't as bad as it first comes off as, it immediately seems like some low-budget point &amp; click, which has been super popular in the past handful of years. But Decay is set aside from the mumbo jumbo that floods the gaming market nowadays, as it's slightly unique in it's own way, though when it really boils down to the fundamentals, it's nothing special.   Decay is a point &amp; click puzzle horror game, and the puzzles are the correct difficulty (some may be too easy), which is a huge step forward compared to most games of the same genre, which have incredibly specific puzzles which you will probably NEED a walkthrough for ('Scratches' comes to mind). The atmosphere is well established and you can get tied into the game pretty decently, though a lack of depth to the story/characters makes it hard to fully put yourself in Sam's shoes (the main character).   I completed all three episodes and it took me about 2 to 3 hours, and I took my time (took a couple breaks, etc.). It's a short game but I got it for like $0.49 on sale so I'm not complaining about that, also it adequately tells it's story (which is a pretty creative idea) in the correct amount of time so the length isn't a problem. There are a few dramatic cutscenes which explain more of the story which are pretty well-done and some are downright intense, which is cool because most games of this genre have super below-par animation and graphics, but like I said, Decay stands out because it's a bit better than the average point &amp; click puzzle horror.   Though when looking at the theoretical side of Decay, even the good execution doesn't save it from being nothing more than an 'above average' point &amp; click puzzle horror. The story is incomplete, and the storytelling features are below par; the entire story is explained on newspaper snippets, which is the only time voice acting is present (and I don't know if it's just me but he reads WAY too slow). Voice acting isn't even present in the cutscenes, which is where I feel they should have allocated the talent, because I can read a piece of paper alone, but when I'm watching two people argue for example, I'd prefer to hear their voices rather than read it.   This is an ongoing problem for Decay: the developer just flat out made dumb decisions. The navigation is also difficult, given the fact that some rooms will start at the same orientation once you enter it no matter the angle you entered it from (the game is entirely 'slide-show' style movement and looking). So for example, if you enter one of these types of rooms from the end of the hall, it will put you on the wrong side facing the door you just came through, making the buildings feel more like a labyrinth than a residential home. And some rooms don't do this, and will orient you correctly, making it just as confusing since you probably expected to be looking at the door you just walked through. It's all very confusing, but you quickly memorize the layout of the buildings in each episode since the maps are relatively constricted, so it's a short-lived con. The small maps aren't really that much of a problem though, as there's a good density of things to do in the amount of space they give you.   All-in-all, Decay isn't bad. It has a decently creative idea behind it, it's execution is above par, and the length is accurate-albeit short, if that matters to you. But the overall experience is what matters, and while at some points I was super invested in what was happening, and the game DID hold my attention for a good 2.5 hours (which is increasingly rare nowadays), it didn't have a lasting or any sort of serious impact on me. And being a dramatic horror game about murder and finding yourself and the answer to deep life questions, Decay should've made me feel way more.   6.6/10",

However, requiring a notebook for only one string of numbers, the game isn't nearly as deep or rooted in puzzle as Myst. It's basically a point and click adventure game that resembles that of an 'Escape the room' flash game. However, the little nuances and timely jump-scares kept me playing.   The story started to pick up a little over halfway through and although room navigation is sometimes difficult, the puzzles are simple yet require a little more thought than usual, keeping the pace fairly consistent throughout. There wasn't a point where I got stuck and wanted to quit.   The conclusion and resolution to the game makes you feel satisfied of the journey you took to get there.   All in all, not bad for a two and a half hour playthrough.",
