The characters are fun and interesting, the storylines varied and overall this game is adorable. I love the art and the music and how each relationship can play out. If you want to date a tiny elf, a cool rogue-ish dude, a freaking dragon or a burly manbeast (who are all princes!) this is for you! It's worth every penny!",

EDIT:   that didn't happen but i would've laughed if it did. but i'm capable enough to know that that's the case after all. blue magic, that smile, knowing about time travel, teleporting, being mysterious and having a bad sense of humor? he's sans, dammit.
