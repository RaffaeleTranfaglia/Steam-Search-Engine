            "review_text": "Monster RPG 2 is a 16-bit JRPG. The story focuses around the main character who is teleported to a fantastic world, because his friend finds a magical evil staff in the middle of the forest.   The main story is linear and quite simple and I haven't found any side quests in two hours that I've played  Items don't tell you what they do neither what is its purpose in the game. They don't show any stats and you must try it to know if they affect in some manner to the result of the battles.  The map is full of empty space and empty of life. There are some key npc if you need to talk to them, some red chest with potions inside and some decoration.  There are a lot of different kind of enemies but they appear too frequently, and injure too much to make the experiance grateful. For example: A bear killed one of my guys in a single turn and i had to hit it during three turns using the rest of characters to kill it. This point and that fact that there are no potions available between combats make the game too difficult, a difficulty near the limits of gameplay.  The inventory management is not very intuitive, i think developers must improve it.  The main character is easy to control using four arrows and spacebar or using a mouse  Graphics are japanese SNES style, music and sound are quite normal.  It has achivements and trading cards.  In my opinion, there a lot of games better than this but you could give it an opportunity if you grab it in a bundle or you like the difficult challenges.  PD: Thanks to Shade00",
