Why is this a 'pro'? Because you're dating a dozen girls at once. There's a moral to this story.   Cons:  * It's a clicker / idle game * Since it's a clicker / idle game, you keep coming back for hours on end just trying to make things that take ages take less ages. * Honestly you shouldn't play this. It's hard to escape. You could be playing other things! You could be doing something useful! You could have written your own game, or book, or symphony! But no, you come back and do the same thing you did the last 300 times but slightly quicker.... because it's so easy to do... * You will never escape. Never. Unless you cheat and set your clock forward or hack some files. But... that's cheating...",

And if you play their NSFW version you'll find that the scenes for the lover level are redraws from the SFW version. Since you cannot transfer your progress from this one to the NSFW version I suggest you save your money on it and just keep playing the SFW version if you started with it. The only thing worth while playing the NSFW version is the exclusive character Nutaku who is through and through original. Nothing redrawn about her. For all the other characters it's the same poses minus clothing and pretty boring for the amount of work put into it. This game will take you months to progress in without buying diamonds, probably even longer. Kind of regret spending money on it because it's just now dawning on me how impossible it is to get anywhere with it unless you spend more money than I did.",

It demands much less effort and attention than AC, and it's much more fun because of all the  personality and love  the devs have put into it. The girls make a lot of puns and have some very amusing lines. I find myself repeatedly talking to each of them when I don't need to just to find out what smart line or reference to popular culture the devs managed to come up with. They are that interesting! Even the names of the jobs you can have are amusing.  To whom it may concern, the Steam version has no sexual content as of yet, but the devs say it will be coming. The nude version already exists on another website.",

This game is so perfect, graphics, top notch animation and at 2048880017000 x speed, it's a perfectaly paced adventure.  Just one tiny detail, it's not very realistic. For example a donut costs $5880 in the game when in real life it's closer to $0.50. Likewise going on 100 consecutive dates in the moonlight would probably result in boredom or the woman clinging tightly on her pepper spray. Same for offering her 10,000 cars or 50,000 diamond necklaces at once, boring and hard to store, she would also call the FBI thinking you stole them, but with $193,329,423,530,654,553,980,040,390,267,002,046 in your bank account you could buy the FBI and pretty much all services on earth so her phone call wouldn't do a damn thing!
