    "description": "Dark Shadows - Army of Evil takes you back to September 1362. A horde of monsters has been ravaging the country like a plague of locusts for over a year. While you were away doing your knightly duties of catching a runaway horse, the monsters stormed the castle, injured the king, and kidnapped Katarina, the love of your life.",

This game is incomplete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the problem is the developer wanted to earn money like the big companies but he failed at 1 point : the big companies only give u a half ♥♥♥ game like AC:Unity but this ♥♥♥♥ is not even 20 % finished. It is the biggest piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on steam which i have explored. Furthermore, the textures and the performance of this game (in this case it's just a piece of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t) are just ridiculous.The Dev's deserve a punch, right in the balls, for this mother♥♥♥♥ing trash. EVERYTHING IS WRONG WITH THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME !!!!!!",

            "review_text": "Oh my god.  This game is hilarious.  Nearly everything is this game is done WRONG. COMICALLY WRONG.  Oh where do I start? How about basic controls?  Press spacebar to jump. Jump once and you fall twice, the second time being gravity kicking in after the preset fall animation.   Hold spacebar to do your impression of a rabbit on meth. Boingboingboingboingboingboing. Careful though, you can get fall damage from jumping too much. Seriously.  Press M1 to bring up a mutated, paralyzed left hand, completed with an elongated pinkie finger and a stretched texture.  Press M2 to bring up another mutated, paralyzed arm with a tapered, shrunken hand holding a pebble. It reels back, unmovingly, as if made of wood, then quickly forward again, throwing the pebble...which gently floats to the ground. Physics!  There is no crouch or run button (shift does nothing).  There is no map ('M' changes the mouse sensitivity) and no hints or aids in finding quest items. Now, I'm all for a little open-world exploration. Not every game needs a big old Bioshock arrow pointing at anything of interest. But this is the polar opposite. Here, there first level is a castle full of winding, identical corridors, and the first mission in that level is to find a sword and some keys. I managed to find one of the keys through blind explortion. It was difficult, though because it was the same color as everything else: greyish brown, and had nothing indicating its presence. No outline, no environmental context, not even so much as a reaction from the character when looking right at it.  Press Escape to see the tiny, 200x200 pixel menu. The itty-bitty options are mostly miscellaneous graphical options, like blood decals. If TotalBiscuit ever did a WTF on DS-AoE, he might have to start playing the game BEFORE the ten minute mark, since there's not much twiddling to be done with a menu like this.  As for me, I ended my game after I jumped on even terrain and the fall damage killed me. Then the game crashed. Yup.  This is a walking simulator for insomniacs. Or, alternatively, comedy gold for people who love to laugh at terrible games. Either way, it's too bad to pass up. I recommend it.",

If the creators had taken the time to do something risky and creative they could have accomplished a lot, even with this limited technology. This feels like the first try college project that never got polished after it was turned in to the professor. Definitely not worth any more than 2 dollars. Everyone should play this game just to understand why you shouldn't give super open ended unintuitive content to people followed by constant repetative fighting.",
