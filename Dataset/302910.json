            "review_text": "Let me put this in bullet form on why this game sucks.  *Models and textures don't fit  *Your light sources get used up WAY too fast. Of course some of your light sources barely 'light' anything at all...  *No clear direction on what you're supposed to do (Wouldn't even be that much of a problem if you could at least SEE!)  *The 'scares' are just .jpeg's and models that just pop out in front of you and make a loud noise. It gets annoying after a while.  *No story at all. You're just a guy who goes into a house. You have a car, but no flashlight! What sense does that make?!  I wanted to give this game the benefit of the doubt at first. I really did. But I couldn't even play past the first 15 minutes. This game shouldn't have been greenlighted yet. There is a TON of work that needs to be done on it.",

I found something on the ground by the clock but can't pick it up and candles in a room that last about 10 seconds maybe, it would be awesome to explore if I could SEE where I am going, at least games like Outlast give you tons of batteries and you can see through nightvision, this game has a lot of bugs that need to be fixed. I have to say the first 2 jumpscares got me but I can't progress without light. Please fix that, at this point I don't recommend the game",

            "review_text": "Seven minutes.  That's how long it took to annoy me enough to exit the game and uninstall. That's a full five minutes longer than the lighter, matches, or candles last in the game which brings me to my complaint and why I stopped playing: it's too dark. If I can't see anything,  at all , I'm not going to play. Judging by the drive and then walk up to the house, I'm unsure if it's this dark to create 'atmosphere' or to cover up rough-around-the-edges models that seem to pop in and out of the landscape.",

            "review_text": "ok, so this game is terrible. I bought it for a buck so I'm not too mad or anything. I just feel like with a few things it could be a fun-bad game. The lamps on the wall only illuminate the immediate 3 inches around it. I felt like after somehow scurrying downstairs to get the gas running again I would at least be rewarded with some minimal lighting. if that were the case then the lack of sustainable light on the go could be slightly forgiven. The game has so many weird bad things about it that are very basic, like collision and textures and the like, but it's biggest offense is that you can't see. If you're not capable of giving it the creepy eyes-adjusting-to-the-dark thing then at least let the lamps slightly illuminate the whole room they're in. Basically, running around a messed up house in the dark is fun even if it's dumb, but doing it blindfolded is not, which is what this game quickly devolves into.  I seriously doubt this, or any other issue will be reolved in a satisfactory manner, but still this game perplexes me. i don't understand how it came to be.  but for most people, i.e. people looking for a fun and entertaining experience, this is not the game you are looking for.",
