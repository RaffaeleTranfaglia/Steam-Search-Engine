Depending on your tastes, the characters and their interactions can be really enjoyable. Also, depending on how much you emphasize on logical aspect of the game, you might get turned off by some ridiculous occurences or story backgrounds. If you're really flexible, like I am, you probably wouldn't mind them, as the explanations given don't sound too much like excuses. If you're looking for something not too complex and not too serious and would like to enjoy a good read and a simple mystery, this can be a good choice.",
