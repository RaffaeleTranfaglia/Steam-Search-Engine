            "review_text": "This game is trying to be something like a small visual novel, where you add photos in album as your parents talk about the events from the photos.  I kinda liked it, but translations have alot of errors,its extremely short and it doesnt offer pretty much anything besides puttings few pictures in album..   Pros: - I like the drawings and pictures look nice - Somewhat unique  Cons: - It is very very short (can be completed in less than 10 minutes) - Bad translations",
