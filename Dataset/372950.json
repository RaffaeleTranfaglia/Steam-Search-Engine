            "review_text": "Ok, after contacting the support repeatedly, I finally got the full-sized cards pdf.  The AR aspect is still not too reliable, but then it's a nonaiming camera/barcode combo, so it is damn good for that -- and putting in support for NFC or multi-pen tablets would have been rather extraneous as very few people have that equipment.  Having fun with kids. I'd say, the age bracket for this game is before they actually start learning chemistly, at least, from my memory of the course. I'll put it at about grade 5-6.  Let's see what other games in the series there will be.  Also, would really love to see more languages supported.",
