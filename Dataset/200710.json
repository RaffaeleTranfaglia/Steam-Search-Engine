            "review_text": "I didn't buy this for a long time, despite wanting to try it, because in my opinion, once you'd played one Diablo clone, you'd played them all. And I still hold this opinion to be very true in a lot of ways - for example, Titan Quest, while initally intriguing, became a hellish repetitive single-player slog through to the end that, after 20-something hours of playtime, left me exhasted and scarred. Torchlight, however, surpised me. Perhaps it has something to do with the well-designed classes that aren't quite as derivative as many Diablo-clones, or the deep levelling system that allows so much variation within the same class, or the well-honed difficulty scaling that makes you feel like you're always growing, or perhaps it's all these features combined that make this game stand out.   The controls are intuitive and the mechanics of the game are well-implimented. The enemies are numerous and varied, and there's always surprises to be found in every corner of the randomly-generated maps. The champions and bosses are similarly frequent in appearance, a factor which helps to eliminate that feeling that you're just grinding a way, wasting time until you fight a boss battle. In saying that, playing this game on single player, I did feel like I was taking part in the occasional grind through enemies and loot and levels, which bordered on tedious at time, but playing with a friend and sharing that burden eliminated that feeling entirely.   On the topic of multiplayer, I felt that it could have been slightly better implimented, in that, for one, it took forever for my friend and I to find each other in the server screen, and there was a bug that occasionally stopped us from adding one another without a full game restart. Also, unlike the Borderlands games (the pinnacle of intuitive multiplayer connectivity in my opinion), you cannot see what missions your partner has to do, so you're contantly relying on them telling you what they're up to (via text chat, if you don't have steam chat), and if you're more advanced than your partner, then any enemies that you've killed won't reappear for your partner, regardless of who is hosting the server. Although I'm sure there's a reason for these issues, they seem like really bizarre features to omit from the game. I mean, sure, you may get a tad overpowered if you're allowed to kill creatures a second time round, but is that really worse than your partner being forced to wade through a sea of emptiness, constantly underpowered due to lack of combat? In any case, all I can recommend is that you start multiplayer games at exactly the same time.  Torchlight 2 is a well-made, deep and enjoyable experience, especially with friends, that separates itself enough from other Diablo clones to really stand at the top of the pile.",

            "review_text": "Torchlight 2 is the successor of Torchlight, having you pick up right where the action ends in the first game, in a scenario where you must again save the world.  Unfortunately, I did not play the original Torchlight, but that might intrigue others who are coming into Torchlight 2 as their first game of the series.  Torchlight 2 came out around the same time as Diablo 3 and was arguably better at that time, the controls feel very tight and responsive and the combat enjoyable and satisfying. Diablo 3 has improved, however, and so has Torchlight 2! The huge modding community has added such a dearth of content to the game it's almost added an entire gamesworth of content to it!  For myself, I completed the game on Veteran mode within 22 hours and enjoyed it all. It got a little tedious towards the end as I just wanted to complete it, but that's just me being impatient and not being too au fait with these types of games (D2/D3/PoE etc).   But yeah! A great game overflowing with charm and depth! Check it out!  Nilesy",

            "review_text": "  -Quick Review-   Torchlight II is a dungeon crawler game that lets you chose to play as a few different classes. The basic concept is the same as nearly all dungeon crawlers: Explore, level up, find gear, beat the boss, rinse and repeat.    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  Oh no! the alchemist is going to bring about the end of the world! You there, unnamed random hero, it's your job to warn everyone, and be just a few steps behind the alchemists defiling touch. As I implied, you're obviously the hero, the villain you will be trying to catch is known as 'the alchemist', whom has been corrupted and destroys all that is in his way.   Game Play:  I sense that most dungeon crawlers are time consuming on purpose, I spent a good 30-40 hours before I beat the game, then I kept playing for another 30 hours to get to max level, and at that point I stopped playing. The whole dungeon crawler genre is criticized for giving us 'carpool tunnel', you click, a lot. you do use keys to cast different spells, attacks, and abilities. So for fair warning, you will spend a lot of time in this game clicking. There is a feature in the game that lets you load up your pet with tons of gear, and send 'em back to town to sell them for you, or buy health potions, basically you never need to go to town to sell gear or buy potions, you're servant pet will do it for you. What does this mean for you, brave adventurer? More dungeon crawling, less vendering trash items! Yay! (Hopefully!)    Achievements:  So I hit 76% completion on this game, I've given up trying to actively get 100% completed for achievements, mostly because RNG (Random Number Generator) hates me. I decided getting above 75% was pretty good for a game with 123 achievements, many requiring grinding. Achievement categories: Beat the game/boss, try doing this, kill this many enemies, open this many of these, do this ____ amount of times, get lucky, play long enough to do this 100,000,000 times. Again, basically I assume that I'll eventually make more progress on this game as I find people who are like 'hey, play this with me!' and I'm like 'okay, I only need to 3,000 more potions! let's do it!' Half of these achievements are from just playing the game, so you can enjoy that, but getting 100% will require a lot of play time. Just a warning :)   Price:  Torchlight II costs $19.99, I've spent 70 hours playing it. That's definitely worth it. Most people will at least get over 20 hours in the game, even if they're not trying to beat it. As always, I suggest getting the game on sale or in a humble bundle, but the stand alone price is very much worth it, based on the amount of game time I squeezed out of it.    Conclusion:  Story: interesting the first time through, it was very dragged out (not in a bad way, really), Game play: click x1,000,000 (over 9,000 clicks used in the making of this review), Achievements: nothing to write home about, Price: very good price based on the amount of time required to play through the whole game. This type of game is best suited for people who already know they like dungeon crawlers, I've played several, if you're new to the series this is a great game to start trying it out with! Just be warned there is a lot of clicking involved. Again, this game becomes a 100 times more fun with a friend or two. But, I did play through the whole game solo my first time.",

Sadly there are few things which prevent it's from achieving a masterful status.  The lore of torchlight 2 is not that interesting and cutscene are reminess of bad cartoon network show. The voice over is not that great and the story it self is something we have seen a 1000 time.  However the pet system, looting gear and the Master Full soundtrack will keep you entertain till the end   7.9/10 Verdict: Torchlight 2 should satified your looting needs just dont expect the quality of a Blizzard Game.",

            "review_text": "Current NG+13 Elite Lvl.500 Berserker's save file has been corrupted. Over 600 hours played with the class over the span of 2 years.  (NOTE: I have played 550hrs up to this point with my one and only berserker, NG+8 Elite w/ SynergiesMOD, maxed to lvl.500, all skills unlocked, fully socketted legendary weapons and armor (cast swords) &lt;- The fact that I've spent all of my time with one character 1 class out of 70-80 I have from mods is telling. This should also emphasize how much I've played this game and my experience playing it.)  (This is my first actual review, I thought I would give this masterpiece the honors.)  Intro: To start I would like to say that I will have bias towards the game even if I try to be as objective as possible. Given my playtime and connection to this game, this should be a given.  I found out about this game from a friend of mine who told me they loved the first game but never played the second, I found out about it and decided I would buy it on sale for I think around 10 dollars around the time (forgive me if this is wrong my memory may be wrong). My past arpg's had been only Diablo 1 &amp; 3 and Sacred 2 at the time so I was excited to hop into another being a newfound fan of the genre.   It all started when I clicked that 'New Game' button. Clicked the berserker and typed 'Shaddah'.  Now to the actual review! I'll make each of these sections quick for your reading pleasure.  Gameplay: (Almost Perfect) Everything in this game plays extremely smoothy, response times are instant and combat is quick, flashy, and most importantly fluid.  Except for the occasional bugs like when i try to shift-click or right-click an item to transfer or equip and the ocacsional hiccup everything else is like it says up there in the parenthesis, almost perfect.  Randomization is extensive in this game, loot enemies, levels, basically almost everything in this game is randomly generated, except for things like your chosen character and pet.  Recommened Mods for ridiculous amounts of content: Adventure Pack II (and levelscale:HIGHLY RECOMMENDED WITH LEVEL500 MOD) SynergiesMOD Haknslash Essentials classpack and level500mod (KEEP IN MIND THIS WILL BREAK AND/OR RENDER SOME GAME MECHANICS USELESS Examples:Making Builds, Some Synergies Content)  Graphics: (Perfect)  They are cartoony, doesn't go for realism and fulfills it's purpose.  Graphics mods I would recommend Ink'd &amp; Ink'd for Synergies The Half-Life 2 ENB Enchancer (ran through Torchlight II Directory)  Sound: (Perfect, phenominal with mods) Music fits it's purpose with general orchestral pieces (my favorite being the menu theme) and nice songs that fit the mood, theme and atmosphere of every location.  Phenominal music mods: Diablo II music mod Final Fantasy music mod (includes track from Chrono Trigger and Chrono Cross)  Overall: (Amazing game)  Overall this game is a phenomincal package for it's extremely low price and even better it you happen to catch it on sale, the community is friendly and the modding scene from what I've seen, seems to be strong and thriving (mainly being represented with Synergies). The game is, in my opinion, the BEST arpg out there hands down and offers the MOST content out of any arpg I've seen here on steam or played in my entire history with the genre.   Sadly there comes a time where I must mention the cons, because even with my deep love for this game I must point out the quirks and cons.  Quirks and Cons: (ehh?) No OpenGL support? - whenever I've tried this by enabling it through .config the game crashes on start. Shift-tab and Right-click sometimes don't work. With a freely moving camera the detail on the levels is only viewable from the fixed and defualt isometric perspective. Some achievements require online play (just a really tiny quirk for me) Mapworks accesibility and variety is, at times lacking, I found it more worth my time to beat the game again, given the more intresting randomly generated enviroments.  All in all the game is phenominal, the DEFINITIVE arpg, If you love arpgs or are intrested in the genre, or even just want a relaxing game to kill time in, this is a MUST BUY!  To end this I would like to thank all the developers and modders that made my experience possible, Runic Games, Salan and all the other mod authors and players out there! Seeya and happy looting!   Do I recommend this game, yes... hell yes!",

But after ages of telling myself, 'I need to try it out,' I finally purchased Torchlight II last night. And I was blown away. Is it like Diablo? Kinda, yeah. But it's a lot... comfier, for lack of a better term. You can customize your character a bit and you get to start with a pet that isn't just cosmetic. Character building, as I understand, is really flexible. I mean, I wanted a battle-mage and I made one. Not fully optimized, mind you, but it's working so far. For the first time in a long while, I've found a game that's made me want to start a save after save, just to see what kinda stuff I can come up with - at only six hours in.   The soundtrack hasn't gotten on my nerves yet, which is saying something. The graphics surprised me, positively; for some reason I was expecting it to look like WarCraft 3 zoomed in. The gameplay's familiar if you've ever touched Diablo, but the game adds its own little things to the mix (inventory cleaning service says hi). I'm sure everything that had to be said already has, so I'll just add one more thing.  Best 3,79 euros I ever spent.",

            "review_text": " An incredibly simplistic Diablo-esque ARPG with  Steam Workshop support  to possibly enhance replayability.  Before starting the game you're given the option to start the vanilla version and the Workshop supported version. You can move your vanilla character to the Workshop version however the character you save your progress with Workshop mods on will no longer be allowed back to the vanilla game.  The game's difficulties range from Casual, Normal, Veteran, &amp; Elite where the differences in these are that the gold drops are lower and enemy damage &amp; health are increased the higher the setting. In Elite mode the game doesn't just feel harder, it feels like more like an endurance because I found myself constantly having to hit, run, heal, hit, run, heal, and repeat wasting more time than I should be wasting if I was on Veteran because everything on Elite can kill you in a flash and it doesn't help that the baddies take a hell of a lot longer to kill because of the artificial difficulty of increased baddie HP. There's a an option to check whether or not you want to activate 'Hardcore' mode for the rest of a character's playthrough where all it means is that one death means you can't play that character anymore so this is really for those who like to be more pressured into being careful to stay alive.  Unlike the first game you now have a choice of 4 classes however the previous classes have been removed though they all use similar &amp; new equipment as the first. Each class has a handful amount of unique skills but I've found that I was really only putting points in an incredibly low amount of them all the way up to the end-game &amp; max level, 100, leaving probably 80% of the skills without even a single point placed. Though effective this leaves the combat to show how simplistic its action is which all-in-all is just hit, run, &amp; maybe heal. No matter how fancy the skills you've put the points on it's still just run, attack, run, and possibly heal up with a potion or a spell so should heavy damage be taken. You can only 'respec' the last 3 skills you've placed points on so you can do a small bit of testing to find out what suits your preference.  The controls for the game are typical isometric ARPG style with the all too likely-to-become problematic mouse-to-move and extensively rebindable keys with the exception of the mouse buttons being unrebindable. I found that the mouse controls can often be wonky; when I try to move to the opposite side of a crowd of baddies to get away from them for some reason the character would sometimes move to them and attack instead despite the mouse being nowhere near them. During critical situations it becomes an incredible nuisance.  Though very diverse in skins, models, &amp; sounds almost all enemy attacks are similar to one another so I found that fighting just became repetitive with the exception of having some new skills to toy with but still overall becomes the same hit &amp; run rule in combat. Even the bosses are fought the same and the way they fight you feel hardly any different from mob attacks.  The environment as well are very limited in variety. The general idea of different types of environment aside from the scenery with some different turns and slight elevations are 'don't walk on this right now or you'll get hurt', some levers or switches you have to activate to progress the game, and putting items in environmental sockets to again further progress.  Normally when anything dies in a map they stay dead. When setting your game to an 'internet' session you can 'reset' the entire world so everything can be killed again. Even all the treasure chests will be up for another round of loot. The multiplayer's functional &amp; pretty basic; go to the lobby, make or join someone's session, and you just play from there either helping one another or doing your own things. Each person in a multiplayer session sees &amp; gets their own loot from drops so there won't really be any stealing of items. If you and some other people have the exact same mods and sometimes load order of mods you can play the modded game with those people.  Despite all its 'problems' and for what it is the game works and does pretty well at what it tries to be even if there's not a whole lot new or special when compared to many other ARPGs like this. It can be good fun to just isometrically dungeon crawl seemingly killing endlessly especially with someone you know but because it lacks special things it can start to be incredibly tedious &amp; repetitive incredibly fast where your only possible source of replayability is likely trying out the different classes, workshop mods, and/or the multiplayer.",

Players create their own hero from one of four new classes, and are tasked with preventing one of the original heroes, who has been corrupted, from bringing ruin to the world. The story serves its purpose of giving players a reason to head off for the next quest goal but for the most part is pretty negligible, with the exception of a few rare quests of interest.  The options for character creation are expanded from the original; there are now four classes and each class has options for its gender, hair, and face. Pets also make a return, with a number of new creatures added. The pets are welcome companions, assisting the player by participating in combat, learning spells, being able to summon minions of their own, and even travelling back to town to sell loot and buy potions so the player doesn't have to.  Basic gameplay follows the template used by other isometric and top-down action RPGs. Players move using the left mouse buttons and click on enemies to attack. There are a wide number of skills and spells available, with numerous ways to activate them through various hotkeys and on-screen icons. The game allows for a lot of variety in builds and play styles, with each level up providing points to add to attributes and to upgrade and learn skills. Also provided is a lot of variety in equipment with no class restrictions, with the exception of some unique loot, although a number of skills require a certain weapon type. Loot in the game is plentiful, but fortunately the game makes it very easy to compare picked up loot with that currently equipped and to switch it into the pet's inventory so it can be quickly sold. There will always be the occasional pause midway through a dungeon to conduct some inventory management, however, outside of these pauses the pacing is quick and keeps the action going at an engaging level.  The dungeons are randomly generated in terms of overall layout, but specific areas like boss arenas are preset. This means that when playing multiplayer or a new game plus, it isn't a matter of simply retreading old routes, and the highly enjoyable exploration experience that the dungeons provide is always there. There is always a danger of such generated dungeons becoming generic and repetitive but it is pleasing to report that the danger has been negated as well as could be hoped for. A number of tougher enemies and special challenge zones litter Torchlight II's areas, providing fairly regular breaks from the usual fodder (who can still pack a punch if players aren't paying attention) and making sure things don't get too repetitive. The player character can become briefly stuck in a crowd that's difficult to maneuver out of, but these situations are rare and typically caused by charging in too wildly rather than through any fault of the game.  With the exception of Hardcore mode, where death is permanent, players can respawn without too much consequence. A percentage of gold can be paid in order for the deceased character to reappear either where they died or at the map entrance. Alternatively they can respawn back in town for free. There are four difficulty options to choose from plus a toggle for the aforementioned Hardcore mode. The Normal difficulty is a decent, but not especially challenging, level for newcomers, so experienced Torchlight players will likely want to jump immediately into Veteran.  Difficulty in multiplayer is handled well, with monsters increasing in toughness depending on the number of players. While it's certainly not necessarily to enjoy what Torchlight II has to offer, there can be no denying the enjoyment of playing the game with others and it adds a more than welcome dimension to the game. Those afraid of having their loot taken by comrades need not fear, as players get their own sets of loot visible only to them. There is plenty of postgame content for players to sink their teeth into after completing the twenty hour or so main campaign, either by tackling one of the main postgame dungeons or by starting a new game plus, which keeps the player's progress but levels up all the opponents to match. New game plus might disappoint some, as it isn't possible to notch up the difficulty, so those hoping for a greater challenge in the main story will need to start a new character. The game has also been created with the modding community in mind, so even if Runic's postgame options run out there will likely be plenty of fan-made offerings.  Visually the game looks great, even on less powerful computers, and for the most part runs very smoothly. The art style is great, the environments are all nicely varied, and the UI is clear and easy to use. Even when hidden behind terrain, it's easy to see where the character is and to click on enemies thanks to a coloured outline that appears for any combatant potentially obscured. Spells and skills are all beautifully animated, and it's incredibly satisfying to see enemies explode upon being finished off with a critical hit. Voice acting is generally rare, but it doesn't feel like the game is missing much without it. The key quest givers and few animated cutscenes are voiced, and it's functional for getting the next task across, but there's not enough of it to have any major effect and can be easily ignored without anything being missed.  For me Torchlight II was an immensely enjoyable experience from start to finish. The game is more than welcoming for both fans of the original and newcomers to the series and is high amongst the better gaming experiences I've had this year. It might not bring anything particularly new to the genre, but those who choose to pick it up will be provided with superb value for their money.    Highly Recommended ",

Runic Games upped the stakes and 3 years after the release of the first game they came out with a more ambitious, more colourful, more varied and more enjoyable sequel.  Whilst the game features the same gameplay-style as its predecessor, notable (and brand new) elements are the availability of multiplayer and the extended modding capabilities.  Also, the four playable classes introduced in this episode are brand new and those present in the first game do not return. These classes offer the options to create several builds so fully getting to know the characteristics of a class requires multiple walkthroughs.   Pets also return (but with more options) and instead of the retirement of our characters we have the newgame+ mode. Also, a hardcore mode for die-hard fanatics.  Torchlight 2 is a must for Diablo fans. But do bear in mind that this is similar to Diablo 2 and not to its latest installment.",

            "review_text": "Torchlight 2 Review:  For this review I will make an effort to break down and analyze different major aspects of the game.  1: Story 2: Graphics 3. A: GamePlay Mechanics 3 B: Classes 3 C: Loot/Equipment 4: Wrap up and Bonus  1 Story The Setting of the game takes place directly after the events of torchlight 1, the alchemist has broken out of the ember mine that the entirety of Torchlight 1 has taken place in, and you start your character out just outside a major town that he has already been through.  The vast majority of the Game's story is presented to you through dialogs with the various NPCs that inhabit the area. The actual story itself, in my opinion is nothing special and while they did make a decent effort, ultimately it falls short of really sucking me in. (But lets be honest the story isn't why you play the game is it?) having said that I did appreciate the easter eggs that the developers put in including a reference to a very popular game that came out around the same time that has the same basic formula.   2. Graphics The game has a bright and colorful world with matching art direction. All the creatures, NPCs and classes look great, a refreshing break from the bleak and demonic tropes that are prevelent throughout the genre. The Spell effects are cool and they don't generally get in the way of seeing the monsters and such. Since the game has lower system requirements than Diablo 3, and starts out in a lower price point, the equipment and overall graphics aren't quite as impressive as Diablo 3. But, the graphics overall feel more like diablo 2 than diablo 3 does.   3 A. GamePlay Mechanics The Combat is fun and depending on the difficulty, requires a lot of careful consideration on how you build and equip your character. I love it. In many ways, I am reminded of diablo 2 in how the mechanics are structured. Its not quite as deep as diablo 3, but I was not expecting that much. Movement is fluid, and, thanks to the low system requirements it runs at a solid 60FPS on my iMac from 2010.   You have 2 different types of leveling you can do. You can Level up traditionally from gettinng experience which allows you to distribute 5 stat points to whatever you want (instead of them automatically being distributed in diablo 3)  3 B: Classes The Vanilla game comes with 4 classes, each look and feel completely different from each other. The Embermage starts out weaker than others, but as you unlock new skills you find yourself with a huge grin on your face as you wipe out legions of enemies. Just don't expect to be able to take more than a few hits. While with the berzerker you go right up close and personal to the enemies attack quickly and annihilate them. The engineer plays more like a tank, with slow deliberate attacks and skills that allow you to summon helpers to attack enemies or to distract enemies from you. Finally, the Marksman focuses on hit and run from a-far with skills that allow for those types of tactics. Natually each of the characters has many skills to choose from that allow for alternate tactics. Unlike Diablo 3, or Path of Exile once you choose a skill, you have to pay to reroll the skills up to 3 previous skill points can be refunded.  3 C: Loot/Equipment  The loot and equipment is quite similar to other games in the genre (IE diablo clones), with the standard tropes of rarity (IE normal, magic, rare and unique, and legendary) with increasing number of bonus' to stats depending on rarity. Each Class has two types of unique weaponry, however that doesn't mean you can't equip melee weapons on a mage or on a ranged character.  4. Wrap up: I was excited for it because several former developers of diablo 2 were heading up this team. I have played a large amount of the game under VMware while I was waiting for the mac native version. and its safe to say that I've gotten my money, your money, and two other people's money's worth out of the game.The thing that REALLY sold it to me was the Mod Support.  5: Mods!  Well you've beaten the vanilla game, thats all well and good but are you ready for the REAL fun to begin? download the Synergies Mod. What does it do? Well for starters, it adds 3 new classes, that all feel like they belong in the game nearly 700!! new pieces of equipment and weapons, new areas to explore, new enemy types, an end-game and raids. not to mention a rebalancing of the existing skills and classes. I would say that its got more content in it than most expansions's do. I cannot reccomend this mod enough. Unfortunately, there is a maximum of 10 mods per game. (this is gotten around by combining mods into 1 large mod pack) And you cannot play with those who do not have the same mods as you.   6. Rating  In this rating system 5 is average, which means its plenty good just nothing special, even slightly.   NOTE the scores below are weighted against other games in the genre.  Story: 3/10 There is a story, it ends and has no plot holes. But thats about it. Graphics: 5/10 While its not super fancy and flashy like its bigger budget siblings, the art direction is pretty good and ages well Mechanics 7/10 Again, not as deep as bigger budget entries in the genre but still plenty of fun (and mod support really helps with this aspect) Sound: 8/10 Matt Uleman (the composer of the dIablo 1 and 2 soundtrack) did the soundtrack for this game and you can hear echos of his earlier work, and its glorious. Combat: 5 out of 10 Its not great but it sure is quite a satisfying experience overall. ",

Torchlight 2 is an addictive game, where you will always get a great feeling when you get a new peice of awesome loot, or are able to unlock a new skill on level up, and you will constantly want to push furhter onward. Though torchlight 2 has all the standard action Rpg fair (swaths of skills, tonnes of loot, socketed gemsand gambling for gear) it's the things that it brings to the table on top of this that makes it stand out such as the pet, which give you and extra inventory and can run to town to sell loot and buy potions, and the fame system which acts as another way to get skill points for more epic abilities.  My only real gripe with the game is the lack of any real consequense for dieing (unless you're on hardcore where it is too much of one) as when you die you can just respawn in town for no loss, or spawn in area for a 10% gold loss, giving dying the feel of a time waster, but not a real threat, which takes something away from the game.

I am also very annoyed with the creation of another Runic account to link to my Steam account. I would like to be able to transfer my game to another Steam account not the one I bought it with.   Another pet peeve (which can't be helped) is the feeling of repetition deeper into TL2. You can see copies of Ratlings, skeletons and Brutes appearing over and over again. They just come back with a different name and different skin.  $4.00 SGD  PROS 1. Great map design Quests and story rolled into one. Not all the quests are in the town, some are hidden away in the map, so it makes you want to explore. However, the downside is that you might miss some of these quests as you don't know where they are. E.g. Zephari Envoy  2. Secrets There are lots of interesting secret areas. One memorable one was 'It puts the lotion in the bucket' (obvious reference to Silence of the Lambs). I shouldn't spoil how to do it but let's just say it will be interesting to find the lotion.  3. Skill trees I like the way you can upgrade your skills and that there are so many skills to work with, per character. Each skill is tiered into T1, T2, T3 with a special upgrade at each tier. There are a lot of way to play your character.  4. Semi-Live NPCs The NPCs give you information on current events which are related to your quests and they don't function purely as lamp posts. I think they could have made it better by making the NPCs come alive even more though.  5. Train Travel Although a cut-scene, it was cool. I was hoping to interact with the train though. I think that it would be better if we could go onto the train and do stuff on it.  6. Interaction Quite a few items but not everything. You can break urns, rocks, explosives and barrels but those are a given. Lighting the braziers to provide light was most innovative. I think having levers or switchs that moved big bridges would be quite cool.  7. Knocking creatures off There are some ways to knock off tiny land creatures, off the terrain and into a pit. Very cool, much better than an invisible ring. Of course, you can be knocked off as well.  8. Pack mule / Pet I love my pet and the ability to sell items without going back to town.   9. Spider Mines I can't believe there are spider mines that seek out enemies.  10. Alternate weapons Press W. Switch from range to melee. Great move. Change playstyle instantly. *Star star*  11. NPC hunting You can get more NPCs to help out in the town if you go out of your way to do side quests. Again, a potential pitfall as you might miss them totally, but it's okay. The similarity to Suikoden's hero collection is great.   CONS 1. Bugs Can't pick up items that fall onto ledges Can't shoot creatures who are no more than a few feet above or below you.  2. Murder Hobo Almost everything is still mass murder. Kill, kill, kill, kill and more killing for any quest. I'm a mass murderer in this game. I've yet to come across a quest without premeditated murder.  3. Stupid things You are face-to-face with an enemy. However, you can't reach him because of a crack that runs through the floor, dividing you and the enemy. Most ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think a jump would be great.  4. Runic Account creation Most annoying. I have to create another account just to play online. &lt;------ This here pisses me off.  5. Spell keys 1,2,3,4 are easy to reach. 5,6,7,8,9,0 extremely hard. Would have been better with 1234QWER.  6. Repetition Ratlings, goo, skeletons repeated. Just with a different colour palette and skin.  7. Fame What does this do?  8. Content Only 4 levels. I breezed through them. It didn't feel like there was enough interesting stuff. Just lots of similar level bashing.  NEUTRAL 1. Trash drops I am not so certain about trash drops that just keep on generating a lot of junk for me to sell. Perhaps, something else can be done about trash drops?  SUGGESTIONS I saw ladders in the game. Could Runic code an interaction with ladders?",

            "review_text": "Many dungeon crawlers pride themselves on lootporn. Runic Games realises it's nice to also package in an actual game with your Excel sheet, and manages to build an inviting world with a responsive and satisfying combat system.  The game's story is one of tragic desperation, told across 4 acts, and while I won't spoil anything I suggest you not play this for its storyline, as it doesn't go far nor deep. Don't mistake this for a lack of charm though, as each of the game's environments are colourful and varied. From bright shining deserts to gloomy forests and snowy ... cold places. My eyes were never bored.  The four classes available in the game all have their distinctive styles, but also allow for a large amount of customisation on the player's part. Many different active abilities are available to choose from, which translates to many different ways to play. Within the admittedly limited amount of classes I can almost guarantee anyone will find a build they're comfortable with. A minor point against this is that respeccing is not available in the base game. Modding rectifies this.  Which brings me to my next point: The players. This game has an abundance of that whole consumer-friendliness our industry seems to relish in not caring about. You want mod support? It's in there, ranging from the smallest of tweaks to total conversions. Always online DRM? Don't be so daft, play offline if you like and have a lovely experience. What about LAN? Yeah, LAN support is in, go nuts. Also note the apparent lack of any microtransactions or locked-behind-paywalls DLC. The point I'm trying to make is that if you take the direction of the industry into account when you're considering a purchase, this is definitely not the worst option available.  Lastly, I should point you to its price. This game doesn't exactly break the bank compared to most other releases of this scope.  HowLongToBeat.com  lists the average main story completion takes around 20 hours, that's not counting the side quests in the field, extra dungeons, mapworks (endgame dungeons) or New Game Plus mode.  So what have we got? A 20ish hour flat story with a pleasing coat of paint, well flowing and varied options for combat, single- online- and LAN play and excellent mod support packed into what is a relatively inexpensive game. If your interest has been piqued I highly recommend you play this game, but if you’re on the fence I suggest having a go with the free demo first.",

The result is a true spiritual successor to the games many of us sank countless hours into.  Strapped for cash? It's only $20. Lousy internet? There's Offline and LAN play. Crummy computer?

You can no longer upgrade gems the same way, so you don't need to feel compelled to collect and keep all the gems. They added a limited ability to respec your character, so you have a few levels to play around with skill choices, which I found useful. However, the most notable change (for me) is the independent treasure drops. There is no longer a mad scramble for the best loot if you play multiplayer.

Althought the game is fully enjoyable if played alone, the cooperative multiplayer truly adds to the exciting and varied battles, the narrative adventure (that is if you even read the quest descriptions), and the mltitude of exotic pets that will end up just being your couriers. All in all, if you have the time to sit down and enjoy a few hours of an exciting and original RPG without having to worry about all the inconveniences other RPGs include to essentially replace gameplay time with filler time, then Torchlight II gets a TAN-OUDDA-TAN!

I am what I presume to be about one-third of the way through the game judging by level and achievement progress, though I intend to continue playing after I complete the game with my current character. Perhaps the biggest problem I'm facing is my pet hawk being so much more powerful than me. then again, I suppose I am the one that taught it such powerful spells and provided stat-boosting equipment in the form of a collar and tags. One of my most recent side quests had me help a man recover masks in an attempt to bring peace to two warring races, and though I won't spoil all the details, it was a perfect, 'Plot twist!!!' moment that had me grin and facepalm at my want to help (And need for xp!)    He turned out to be evil and needed the masks to gain power. Whoopsies! Was fun defeating him though~     Overall, I would suggest this game to anyone that enjoys RPG-style games that finds others hard to run due to system requirements. The minor issues I experience are not enough to subtract from the experience and pleasure of this game. A 9.5/10",

Other than the lack of proper story, but rather a simple plot to encourage you to continue on your monster killing rampage, Torchlight 2 exceeds in all categories, and is in my opinion, a better sequel to Diablo 2 reather than Diablo 3, taking into account the price tag.

On the gameplay end, i would comment that it is quite enjoyable. Each class has many different styles and weapons and there is immense flexibility. A problem though was that i felt that many of the rare drops could have been more accessible towards the end. this problem though it easily recitified with mods, of which Torchlight 2 is quite friendly towards. There are many mods that range from simple UI tweaks to better loot drops to an entire revamp of the game.

Diablo 3's release was a joke and shows the folly of imposing always online in a game that does not need it. I find it worrying that Blizzard, Activion Blizzard now I suppose, are helping set this precedent of very heavy handed DRM.  Torchlight 2 is fun, cheap, can be played in offline mode and has a lan mode. I like that hoarding ember has been discouraged in the game and I like all of the classes. It was pretty silly that I had to use autohotkey in Torchlight as key bindings for abilities could not be changed but thankfully this is different in Torchlight 2. Mod support has vastly increased the life of the game for me. I've not even progressed past the second area as I've spent so much time playing around with community created classes and such in hardcore mode.

            "review_text": "Everything and more!  Torchlight was one of the best hack and slash RPG's to come out between the release of Diablo II and Diablo III. It had us turning our head, if even for a short time, and (if your a fan) rejuvenated our love of the genre with its colorful graphic's, epic loot, and random dungeon generator. While it was fairly generic it hit all the right notes, and except for multiplayer, was the perfect game to play till the release of Diablo III. Then Diablo III released....... Well while some did enjoy it, LOT's of players hated it (not a fan myself) and quickly Torchlight's predecessor was to the rescue.  Now with a full multiplayer mode, modding capability, and overall improvements to the gameplay, Torchlight II is a fantastic sequel to the colorful h&amp;s RPG from a few years ago. However there are some problems. Multiplayer is great to have if you want to play with friends, or have a small group on the net that regularly play. However if you expect the multiplayer to be as fully featured as games like Diablo III, Path of Exile, or hell even Diablo II you may be hard pressed. Its pretty much just a list of people playing and if you want to play with them you can, however most games are locked with a password and the games that do have people playing don't allow you to chat with them or anything before joining to find out what there doing. In fact you can only chat in game which kinda sucks if you want to set up quick runs or do any kind trading. As of late the multiplayer is pretty much dead. Overall I have to say that Torchlight II's multiplayer is not going to be the biggest draw for most fans of the genre. If you play games like Path of Exile or Diablo III for multiplayer Torchlight II may not be for you.  However the overall improvements to the gameplay overshadow some of the multiplayer woes. Simple little improvements and details are what make Torchlight II's gameplay different from other's in the genre. While it will feel familiar to anyone who has played a h&amp;s RPG, things like being able to equip not only a sword but dual wield it with a gun or any other single handed weapon give you the need to experiment with you character. Other things like your pet, make life a little easier for your dungeon crawling hero. Your pet can buy items in town, sell loot you find in dungeons, provide extra storage, and even help you in combat. You can also choose what pet you would like (including a freaking headcrab!).  But the crowing achievement of Torchlight II is its just downright fun gameplay. You will never run out of things to do in Torchlight, Literally. While the games story is fairly generic (pretty much taken straight from Diablo II) the colorful environments epic enemies, fun boss fight, and funny cameos and homages make Torchlight II's story campaign all the more worth it. What most will love however is what you unlock after beating the game. You can just go ahead and do a (New Game +) which allows you to start the game over at your current level and fight tougher enemies throughout. Or you can decide to stay in the Mapworks which is the final hub world. It has all you need with every type of shop and merchant and one particular merchant that gives you random dungeons to buy. You can play these dungeons pretty much forever collecting loot and fighting bosses. This give Torchlight infinite playablity.   Modding is also a big part of Torchlight II. Some people have already created epic mods that act as entire expansions to the game giving you plenty of more hours of gameplay. Modders have also fixed some of the issues with the game like, not being able to re-spec your character at will. While I have not done really any modding I am looking forward to playing some mods later on.  Overall Torchlight II is well worth the 20$ price tag (oh did I forget to mention it's only 20$). Its somewhat lacking multiplayer cant overshadow the excellent hack and slash gameplay. If your like me and mostly play these kind of games for the singleplayer, you owe it to yourself to buy this game. At least give it a chance and get it when its like 5 bucks, trust me its worth it.

To that point, I HATED Torchlight 1, but I am actually a big fan of Torchlight 2. More so than Diablo 3 (pre-Reaper of souls) and more so than dungeon siege 3.  This game really did impress me though. The action is fast-paced and quite consistent as well. Gone is Torchlight 1's horrible scheme of 100 levels of same-dungeon-different-layout; now the game plays in more of an open world, where there are connected regions which have various side dungeons (and 'side-quests') within them. You can fill it all in and search for better drops or you can just move foward with the main questline if you like.   I am also quite fond of the skill and ability systems. It is very reminiscent of Diablo 2, more so than the third. You can select which character stats to increase, as well as which skills to level up. You don't really have a skill 'tree' as you are free to select them at your own whim. However, there are 'ranks' for each skill which give you a bonus trait or added effects once you hit certain levels with each ability.  All in all this game can be very addicting. The visuals and text can be a little too cartoon-y for my taste, but it is very easy to lose track of time while combing a new map or thrashing your way through a dungeon and it is fun to take the (short amount of) time to build your character. Plus there's multiplayer, so fun with a friend!",

It doesn't take very long to finish the game and we ended up by spending the rest of the night talking about what would have made the game much, much better.  Thing's such as..  More Loot (We hardly found any) More Gold (Almost impossible to find gold) More mobs, (We spent most of the time looking for things to kill) Too long between levels. (We barely hit the cap) Just doesn't feel right. (Even on a quad core overclocked, the game still lagged like hell)  We also thought the game was too realistic for our liking. There were too many stages in the game that it bought back bad memories for one of our crew. Most of the time spend looking for mobs was spent consoling my friend on his middle ages hates and nightmares.  Too expensive. I paid $6.20 for it on special, and actually went to download the game of Bay of pirates cause I felt ripped off.  We also found the game too Linear. Not enough choice.  THEN AGAIN,  The pro's of the game would be it was... Extremely challenging. We found dying from common mob spawns too often and had to be revived. Just about all of the (hardly non existant) loot was usable. We hardly found ourselves selling anything from our bags. PLENTY of inventory space! (We think this could be nerfed to balance the game) All classes except the engineer were too powerful and it feels like the engineer is a lonely character with no companions to assist his journey. Also, Hi's AOE could have been vastly improved as taking on more than 30 or so mobs proved quite challenging.  Also, slight suggestion? Berseker needs to do more crit hits.  NOWHERE NEAR, enough potions.  The game would probably be best suited to the simulation catagory to be honest.   So there you have it, Torchlight2  If your a fan of games like Sims2-3, Sim City Societies - Doom3 - Cruise Ship Simulator, then this probably isn't the gamw for you,  however if you love Grand thieft Auto or any racing games for the matter,  then spend your money.... You won't be dissapointed.  P.S. Maps were too sparesely populated.  Fin!",

PROS:  this game is like a cross between a good RPG,DIABLO II, and SKYRIM, it has awesome semi open worlds fairly creative monsters, good enviroments, huge weapon an armor selections, skill trees, good gameplay, some pretty dang big guns, siezmic hammer, gunbot, missiles, boss fights, flashmobs of cursed swords and tuscan raiders that chain you up and kill you in 3 seconds flat! etc etc. CONS: it does bother me a little bit that there are only 2 people you can buy things from in town, the arms dealer and the pot dealer (pot means potions guys), you cant buy gems to put in sockets, there are no identify books or portal books like in Fate, and really a pretty limited selection of everything else, so its really hard to get decent armor and weapons. then again this could be a pro for a lot of people. the thing i dont like most, which is just a personal thing, is that it gets very repetitive, battle way through several levels of dungeons, kill unbalanced boss that has way too much HP and not enough damage, portal back to surface. rinse and reapeat.  that being said the pros FAR outway the cons and i love the game, even more so because i got it for $4 when it was on sale. but this game should be worth at LEAST $20 if not $30, so its still a great game at full pice.

Torchlight II is also lacking on classes, skill trees, builds and items. It has workshop support and some cool mods but still nothing can't fix what's missing.

The story itself is decent with nothing to brag about, Save the world from the Dark Alcehmist and so on, and bits of lore here and there. What makes the game great is the amount of variety in the game.   There are 4 classes, Ember mage, Beserker,Engineer and Outlander in the game, Each with 3 distinct skill trees that offer interesing ways to deal with enemies. Use the Engineers skill tree ' Constuct ' to build Machines that willl cut down foes with machine gun fire, or Golems to smash any oppostion. Play as an ember mage and use Fire, Ice and Lighting for destrucitve effects that you can chain and combo together. Each role has a distinct combat style with each skill tree giving that class a certain role, or multiple. You also get a pet of your choice. Pets act as companions. They will fight for you, carry items and you can even send them to the town to buy and sell items  The level design seems simple, basic and bare-bone at first. how ever looking around you can find hidden quest for secert levels, with of course hidden and rare loot. Locate fishing holes to fish and find certain types of food to feed yout pet and give them buffs. Find shrines for powerfull buffs and and chance to fight bosses for loot. Use portals to compelete challenges for gear and fame. With so much hidden content in the middle and late stages of the game, youll find out it takes much longer to beat a level if you explore enough.  Multiplayer is a great add-on. The loot system ensure no one nabs your bling-bling after a tough dungeon run and all classes support each other in some way. Let the beserker and engineer take the blunt of the attack while the ember mage nukes from a distance and the outlander focuses on the tougher enemies.  Mods have to get attention. You can play two ways. Play default and play with mods. These two act like accounts so dont worry if you think mods will intferre with you default characters. Mods give a huge amount of content. My favorites are the classes you can choose from. You can get mods that add new classes or pets, give 2X the xp or 2x the skill points, unoffical expanison packs, Diablo hud or better lighting, better loot or just a different font. With hundreds of mods you can make the game feel like how it should to you. But you can only have 10 mods active at a time.  All of this for a bargin of $20. The content of this game easily makes it a $60 game but runic games quote' Some people just dont have $60 lying around'. THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A GAME AND SELL IT. Most triple AAA games falsey advirtise or over exaggerate and end up with a lack luster amount of content and people paying for a decent enough game but not what was promised to them.

There where some patches with some bug fixes and more content but TL2 was left behind by Runic pretty fast. There is nearly no information if they are still doing anything on it. I'm very dissapointed with Runic and TL2 which would have had such a bigger potential. Mods aren't really helping and Runic doesn't really help the modders who really have to work hard to get anything done and learn everything on their owns because Runic is silenced(don't know who/what did that to them). I really believed TL2 can become one of the best games i have ever played but the truth is that it is just another unfinished arpg.

Basically its like Borderlands except with only 10 kinds of guns that keep getting new stats like +10 damage, +10.12% health, or + .234110% pet health, or maybe a different color such as green, blue, or maybe even PURPLE.  This mind numbingly repetitive experience has made me travel through countless hordes of meaningless enemies, visiting generic dungeons and generic grasslands, and generic tundras, and generic bandit camps, and generic enemies.  The 'Difficulty' settings would be better titled 'Tediousness Levels'. Putting the game on 'Veteran' difficulty basically makes the enemies have MUCH more health. That's it. No AI Improvement (there's nothing to improve, they just hurriedly stumble towards you), no more intriguing or tricky or trying or mind-engaging, epic battles, it's... just... more strenuous, more exacting, more exasperating, more irksome, more oppressive, more pestilent, more taxing, (and lastly) more troublesome and wearisome.  This game goes against everything I have come to be taught as a gamer. Games to me are supposed to be engaging, fun, entertaining, interesting, adventuresome, often meaningful. They make you want to come back for more. This game has none of these traits and less. Walls of text and walls of stupid Stupid STUPID ENEMIES have numbed my brain long enough.

There is too little room for you to just fiddle around and discover the game's mechanics on your own. D3 took a smarter direction in evolving the crawl genre - they can throw a greater variety of challenges at the player because you are also given the freedom to adapt to novel threats.   TL2's single player is hard like a Rogue, but it takes tens of hours instead of 30 minutes for you to get to the point where you can see the onrush of failure.

            "review_text": "This is a shallow and deeply flawed game. But to begin talking about why I've come to this conclusion, we're going to have to go back to what exactly this game is, and lay out the basic formula. I will also only be reviewing the BASE GAME, from my experience completing the game on casual, normal, and veteran difficulties with the outlander, engineer, and embermage classes.  In T2, just like Diablo 2 from which 99% of the gameplay for this game was directly stolen (maybe not the right term, since the original creators of Diablo went on to make this), you control a character from one of a few different classes at an isometric view, clicking around on randomly generated maps and killing massive hordes of enemies with abilities unlocked by leveling up. As you explore, you enter various different dungeons, taking on basic 'go there, kill that dude' quests, with the ultimate reward being giant pools of money and randomly generated gear violently spewing out of every chests and boss you fight. It's a satisfying system, and it's the reason that Diablo became such a hit; the addictive quality of the rewards and the chunky, power fantasy combat appealed to both the hardcore rpg enthusiasts, and the more casual players who just wanted to see explosions. In a way, it's the perfect formula for a game, so much so that a lot of the mechanics of Diablo were repurposed and combined with Warcraft lore to create World of Warcraft, which is still one of the most popular mmorpgs ever made and defined the genre for the past decade.  Now with that established, I'm going to start to get into the things that T2 does wrong. I am going to assume a basic familiarity with Diablo or isometric rpgs; if you're 100% unfamiliar with the genre besides my short explanation, I recommend watching a few minutes of a random D2 longplay on youtube to get the idea.  In comparison to slower, more tabletop-rooted isometric rpgs like Arcanum, Diablo's strength is that there's no turn based system, to dodge an attack is not about a percent chance it's about you as the player moving your character out of the way of the attack. This might seem like a dumb thing to bring up, but I think it's an underappreciated aspect of Diablo which was part of its massive success. T2 doesn't understand this at all. Enemies in T2 are not meant to be dodged, there was ZERO consideration in the game for how autoattacks are supposed to be negated by a melee character. If you're playing melee and you're against something that can't be CC'd by the one CC spell you dumped points into (D2/T2 favor highly specialized characters rather than general purpose builds), you're at the mercy of the mob entirely, getting kicked around by nearly-instantaneous attacks; this of course being combined with a heavy level of tracking, where slow ♥♥♥ giants will perfectly follow you and spin around like tops to make sure you can never get behind them. Sometimes the harder monsters or bosses will use big wind up attacks, and I think these are the best part of the game as dodging them can get really tense sometimes, but that's totally negated by the fact that the enemies that have these moves ALSO do the tracking autoattack moves anyways in close combat. So what happens is, you take guaranteed damage from bosses, so you chug potions. You chug potions, so now you have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of health regen all the time anyways, trivializing not just the autoattacks, but every attack from the enemy. So, you now stand directly next to the enemy, chug potions, and hold click, with no thought process going into the action at all. There were only a few bosses which challenged this approach on veteran; the Alchemist being one good example, with his laser which pushed you back and did massive damage, but couldn't quite spin around fast enough if you circle strafed. Good use of a unique ability, I just wish that the rest of the game followed this mentality.  For the sake of comparison, let's look at how the embermage has it in this game, in particular. The embermage is widely considered the best class in the game and for good reason. Prismatic bolt, the main attacking move for its most popular build, is an amazing ability, which stacks every possible elemental debuff on your enemies, and can be combined with passive skills for the embermage which causes damage bursts whenever enemies with those debuffs get hit with an attack. The result is that single attacks can proc all the passives at once for HUGE damage burst potential. On top of this, embermage, with a _single_ skill point, can unlock the ability to teleport for nearly no mana cost. This instantaneous teleportation ability alone lets you rather effortlessly kite giant groups of monsters around at no risk of injury to yourself, and also gives you the best possible way to dodge the slower wind up ranged moves from bosses as well. So, to reiterate, the class is a ranged attack class, with the best mobility, cc, and damage in the game. How did anyone think this is fair?  The biggest draw of Diablo and Torchlight is the loot system, and how addictive it can be constantly getting better and better items and finding bigger stacks of gold. But for some reason, in T2 you hardly get any loot at all! Even in the very final dungeon, there's still pickups of 6 gold coins lying around, at a point where a single health potion costs you 400 gold. It's almost insulting, like the developers didn't even consider increasing the gold drops in the later stages, or just forgot. Torchlight 2 often touts during its tooltips that in multiplayer everyone gets their own unique loot drops, which is great. But if you can control drops on that level to give everyone their own, why can I get drops that are exclusive to another class? The class exclusive items were a very obvious place that T2 could've improved over Diablo, but instead it not only has the same problem, it made it even worse. There is no worse feeling than playing singleplayer on an embermage, and getting an outlander-exclusive drop from the boss at the end of an act that's _actually an upgrade for you_, and just vendoring it off. The mechanics and the item stats are all so generalized anyways, all the classes use the same 'charge bar' mechanic for example, so it's like they wanted items to be useful for every build, and then they slapped class-specific requirements on for absolutely no reason I can see besides ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the player off. There's even a tooltip that says to 'just trade the item to another player of that class!', as if that solves the issue in singleplayer...  Pretty much every track in the game sounds like a variation of the Act 1 theme from D2 with the iconic lute, up until the last boss, and it borders on annoying. Act 3 feels rushed together and isn't anywhere near as exciting as it could've been, mostly being a green forested area like Act 1 again, until suddenly you go through a gate and you're in the hellish awesome steampunk setting of the final dungeon, which is the only memorable locale in the game. The aoe dancing lightning ability some enemies have is bugged and does imbalanced amounts of damage, being able to kill you almost instantaneously. Bosses don't regenerate health if you die to them, so you can just keep respawning, running in, doing an attack, dying, and repeat over and over.  On and on the list goes, but I feel like here I've covered most of the main points. People rate this game highly because at the time of T2's release, D3 was still fresh on people's minds, and that game really was atrocious. So in comparison, T2 seemed like the better game, and it was. But as time has gone on my opinion of this game has very much soured. The complexity just isn't there. The loot isn't fun. The hardest part of the game on veteran was managing my gold so that I could buy potions and have even a chance to survive. If you like D2, chances are, this will be an interesting distraction. But really, the game's disappointing. Not recommended",

'Nothing special' pretty much sums up the story, as well. Even 'Path of Exile' has more resemblance of a story, than this.  The main problems I had are these:  1. This game throws so much loot at me that I actually get bored by it. What Diablo 3 had too little, TL2 piles onto your shoulders relentlessly. After a while you just quickly check stuff and toss 90% of even rares, uniques, set items and other stuff out the window, because you either cannot use them or have better stuff already.  2. The level of difficulty is a joke. I am no numbercrunching hardcore gamer or anything, but this game is ridiculously easy. Even on the highest difficulty I only died, when the game did something unpredictable or unfair. And that were only a handful of situations throughout the entire game.  3. The character 'individualisation' is rather half-baked: You can only reset your three most recently acquired skills, which makes it completely useless to test new skills from Act 2 onwards. This requires you to choose and stick to your character concept from the very beginning.  4. Nothing about this game is memorable whatsoever. No boss, no level or item.

It took me and 2 other guys almost half an hour to defeat a single boss, and most of that time was spent waiting for mana to regenerate. When we finally beat him, the loot was abysmally boring. Each piece of gear is stupidly generic and useless. When compared to other games such as borderlands, the loot is utterly worthless, with the only changes practially being a 1% increase in damage, while bringing nothing unique or interesting in the 2 different looks per piece of gear.  If you can manage to get through all of that, the gameplay itself is chaotic and difficult to follow. The majority of my time was spent spamming the mouse and tapping keys on my keyboard, all the while half the screen is taken up by useless text, and the other half an epileptics worst nightmare. The art style is slightly charming, however once a fight begins there is just absolute chaos and you have no idea what is happening. I still dont even fully understand how my character works. The character classes are downright dreadful. The only real difference that is present for most of the game is how characters deal damage, with just a different weapon ability. You should not have to wait for 10 hours to unlock an ability that actually gives your class something noteworthy.

That is something that should have been in this genre of game a long time ago. The graphics were fairly good for a game of this genre. I had no real issues with online play and no disconnects either. However, it does use it's own lobby system, so if you're buying this a few years after it's out the online multiplayer may be trickier.  The Bad/Ugly: The classes are rather shallow in this game. They're all really just different ways of dealing damage. I didn't feel like there was really any synergy between the classes. There were no real support ablities other than some self-buffs. The engineer has a healing bot, but other than that there isn't really any way to heal other teamates. Speaking of the engineer, played right, he/she does a lot more damage than the other classes. I was expecting more with the abilities, like in some of the older RPGs where different classes had different roles. In this game class just determines which type of damage you do more or less. As I said above I wasn't expecting an amazing story with this type of game, but this one was rather bland. It felt like World of Warcraft at times (and not in a good way), but with only 4 people.

Yes, I'm aware that the big patch coming for D3 is going to rebalance the loot and address many other issues, but TL2 got them right from the start. The so-called 'cartoony' graphics are a turnoff for some, but I like them. The music is great.  Again, I enjoy both, but in a contest between the two, TL2 wins hands-down.

Even the vanilla version of torchlight 2 has deep custimization of character classes with different gameplay for all. For me it is like the developers of Diablo 2 heard all the complaints I had about it and then fixed them for torchlight 2. Just the shared stash by itself is such an implovment. The modding is not as deep as Skyrim, but it does allow for things like new classes. Some people are put off by the graphics, but I for one am happy that it is not another drab, tired fantasy, midevil, D&amp;D, tolkienesque clone. Instead, we are given a colorful, exotic, steampunk, H.P. Lovecraft setting.  The only cons I can think of are cons that all ARPGS seem to have. The story is generic and it is on rails. You are the chosen one out to stop the great evil before the end of the world, bla, bla bla. Unlike a sandbox RPG like an Elder Scrolls game or even Dragon Age, your only choice is to do side quests or ignore them with no real consequences. That does not detract from how much fun this game is. Bottom line, this game is well worth more than full price and is I think the best ARPG out now.",

Again, like all good RPGs it has traditional leveling up and for people like me, I don't leave a single corner untouched, it is that engrossing. The story lasts (if you're big on exploring) about 24 hours spread out across 4 colourfully detailed regions plus 4 other world designs when going through portals (Like the Netherrealm).The loot system is balanced depending if the area you're in sort of matches your level so you could get a really badass looking helmet from the humblest of creatures in theory.   One downside I have to note is the Ember crafting system, originally you could just get two matching Embers and make the next one up, now it's three and even then, it doesn't necessarily create the one you were expecting. Still, if you want to have a blast for 24 hours (better with friends), Diablo plays second fiddle to Torchlight I think, a Torchlight 3 would also not go unwelcomed for me.",

After playing several hours the game started crashing/exiting when ever I entered certain portals or tried to make a new class. I was very upset because I found this was a long standing problem that has been with the game since launch and this problem was never responded to by the developers.  It's not the game breaking bug that made me upset it is the fact the developer seemingly ignored it. I understand it was a small percentage of players experiencing this but it should have been addressed.  I was able to make the game work running steam under WINE for linux. However running a windows emulator really defeats the whole purpose of having a native Linux client and WINE comes with a whole other set of issues.  I decided I didn't want to play and would rather have a refund and try another game. I contacted the developer to let them know I was upset and why. They responded with in a day and have offered a refund. I'm very pleased with the customer service on that issue.  It's too bad I had to go through so much trouble because overall what I did play of the game was very fun. Definitely one of the best dungeon crawlers I have played.",

Even without mods this game offers amazing replayability due to the procedurally generated levels the game has. I mean the 95 hours I have logged with this title were before the editor was even released. It also has Online Co-op too.  The game offers great character customization too. The game offers three different sets of skills for each class. Active skills range from Fire Pillars to summons that heal you and your friends. You also have access to passive skills which boost damage or your defenses. The skills are flashy and the game has no shortage of explosions. It looks and feels great to play.  Each of the game's acts takes place in a radically different environment. Each map has a completely different tileset and enemies.   It's also worth noting that the game offers multiple difficulty levels that you can change on the fly to make the game suit how you want to play.

Right off the bat, I was pulled into this game more intensely than with its predecessor, just from seeing that I was now a part of a large, open-mapped world. Quests appeared as I wandered around and explored, and the enemy types were incredibly varied. The environment breathed, full of vivacious colors.   A few mechanical changes did not go unnoticed – the interactions with my pet were more useful, and the weapon/armor comparisons were streamlined. Furthermore, the new classes were MUCH more appealing to me this time around – the last game simply had the Holy Trinity (mage, DPS, and warrior), but the classes in Torchlight II bled between several roles. I actually felt an urge to roll one of each and play through the campaign over and over again.   However, I would actually have to list the game’s story as a fault. While they keep you busy with multiple objectives on every stage of the game, the resolution of the main storyline is weak and abrupt. Also, the ending stage of the game reminds me too much of the first game, as you fight your way downward through a tower where the color palette is locked in place and you fight the same five enemies ad infinitum. Overall though, Torchlight II is a blast, and I’m going to keep playing it for a LONG time. I’m about 20 hours in after one play-though, and I’m going right into round 2. It’ll stay installed for a while.",

In view of the game's replayability value due to its modding capability and vast array of item combinations, this is definitely worth the purchase if you're a fan of the Diablo series and would like something unique for a change.",

I zeroed right in on Torchlight II and I'm so glad I did.  While the graphics are a bit too World of Warcraft for my taste, the Ink mod took care of that.  Now that I've gone through the basic game once I can honestly say I really like this game. I love hack and slash games where I don't have to think too much to play. Just pure entertainment. Torchlight II fits the bill perfectly.  I've played Fate, Diablo's 1-3, and Mythos while it was in open beta (man, I hated to see that go). Torchlight II takes the best of those games and repackaged it as something spectacular all in one.  I'll be building my character for some time to come via the Mapworks, enjoying every moment ",

I am the kind to do the Jack of All Trades then grow into a master of all but that's besides the point. The maps are quite large there are countless dungeons that can be revisted all kinds of weapons with equippment sets and socketable items. I like the feature of having a Pet (my outlander has a headcrab which is sick) and how the pet actually can effect gameplay especially if you use those fish that can morph them into other creatures and or give them boosts. Also can give them collars and pendents. I haven't gotten to far into the game yet but I wonder if they've replaced the mercenaries that you can hire. Difficulty is perfect for each setting and I love the fact that there is a hardcore mode. I like that if a place is to difficult that you can go back and level up on weaker monsters then go for more against the tougher opponents. I've played some multiplayer but that was a while ago and from what I remember it worked well and was very enjoyable. There's alot more to this game then just being a 'Diablo Clone' so give it a try. Oh and by the way I played Diablo III and it felt like a Diablo Clone which is sad considering. Anyway enjoy or don't either way I don't care have fun doing whatever.",

I had an enormous amount of money so much it ran off the chart a little and also had best in slot items with the best socketed stuff in them too. I mean completely as good as it gets. I did all that and thought wow what is the point of this? There was no reason to cheat because everything was so easily obtained. And yet people did it anyways and I still wonder why. I found that once you hit a certain point in the game it becomes a battle of the one shot. If you can hit something faster than it can hit you it will die instantly and if it hits you the same happens in reverse and you die instantly. This is why I say weird balance.

The first game was so easy it got kind of boring, even on the highest difficulty, so I started this one on the highest difficulty. It turns out that the only thing that affects is how much health the enemies have (and I think how much damage they do). If you play a build that's fun/interesting instead of 100% min-maxing, it makes the game extraordinarily tedious, and there is zero reward in terms of better/different drops for playing on a higher difficulty. There is no difference in AI or number of spawns, just tons of HP to chunk through, especially bosses. It's still not even all that hard, just time-consuming. Eventually it managed to suck so much of the joy out of the game that I didn't even bother using a save editor to change what difficulty I was on and just moved on to something else.  Protip: If you're playing this game, either min-max the hell out of it or play on something other than the highest diffictuly. If you're making a game, use a less soul-sucking way of scaling difficulty in your game.",

Game is differnt than torchlight. much harder in terms of loot. You don't get scrolls that much and spells. the skills system is excellent has tiers and the higher the tier the stronger the skill. Multiplayer style is same as diablo 2 the way we connect to games and host them. Pet system is more better. the character cusomization isn't that exciting since it has limited customization. hook me up if you want to play with me, its a 10/10, I can play this all day.   P.S Suggest you play on normal difficulty if you never played this game before. It is easy though, but at least get the feeling of the gameplay. Elite is when it gets challengeing, but not hard for me.",

I've actually spent the majority of my time just playing through the game by myself, but you could easily jump into a server with some other people (or link up with friends) and tackle dungeons together. While there are certain items blocked to certain classes, you don't necessarily feel like you need to specialize with your character. It's entirely up to you what weapon you want your character to use, or what skill tree(s) you want to invest your points in. Torchlight doesn't use a 'branching' skill system, meaning you don't have to have lower abilities skilled to achieve the more powerful abilities in that particular skill tree. As such, you are choose freely from your favorite abilities from each of the three skill trees your class has. Another thing that I like about Torchlight is that you level up fairly quickly. I'm glad that it doesn't feel like you need to grind so hard before you go to the next area / dungeon, because the game makes grinding fun, with frequent leveling and the promise of loot.",

The fights are super challenging, with several races of the game using status effects in their attacks to slow you, burn you, poison you and a whole lot more, sure it's a great hack and slash dungeon crawler but the story is indulgent, it has a great flowing mechanics system that Diablo couldn't really offer me, if you don't over-train your character doing the same dungeon over and over, you'll always feel such pressure and the rush of being close to death but still have that glimpse of survival which is what I treasure the most. I played the berserker class with a Headcrab as a pet, I find it wonderful that the game has these little easter eggs connecting to other games such as the headcrab and the vile gnasher mobs. I can't say more that I always felt challenged by this game, even though I've jut started recently, I love it already, I built a lifesteal and critical build to proc onto my skills and rage meter and I always feel like if I stick it out for just a bit more, until I can fill that rage meter, I can JUST squeeze through my enemies without dying, leaving me with a great feel of success, it's like telling you that you couldn't have made it if you didn't persevere. I'm looking forward to buy this game as well as buying it for my friends.",

Without prior knowledge of who created the Torchlight series I quite obviously and understandably turned to Path of Exile. PoE was free and well received. Although it was 'fun' it left me wanting more still. Fast forward to this years Steam Winter Sale and Torchlight II for 5.00$ seems like the deal of the century for me. As quickly as Runic Games won my heart they crushed it equally quick with the departure of co-founders Erich Schaefer and Travis Baldree. My hopes lie with the rest of the team though to come up with another great sequel in Torchlight III (fingers crossed).  Anyways, on to the actual game. Torchlight II is a hack and slash RPG that changes minimally from its predecessors so that it is different but so familiar it seems like you've been with it for years. The character classes are a welcome departure from our normal warrior,mage,rogue and add a more colorful cartoony element to the game. The story telling although sometimes minimal is enjoyable and a break from large cinematics with more narration and cartoon style cut scenes. Outside of these changes it is a tried and true hack 'n slash with multiple acts (3) - lots of challenging creatures &amp; dungeons - and new and sometimes interesting NPCs as you travel from town to town.   Overall Torchlight II is an amazing game that has all of mechanics you love in a hack and slash game with just enough of a difference to make it stand out from the rest. If hack and slash is your genre then Torchlight II is a must own &amp; play.",

Unlike the original where you only had the option of retiring your character and passing an item over to a new one, Torchlight 2 now introduces New Game Plus modes where you can bring your beloved character over to replay the whole game with increased difficulties. The game also actively supports modding and be prepared to see the many interesting mods that will be crafted for it.  Downsides, Torchlight 2 has a very forgettable story which i didn't even bother to pay attention to, although the main campaign itself lasts for about 30 hours depending on the speed you play. But then again, story is not really the main point of this game. It is most enjoyable when you gather your friends and co-op together smashing mobs.  Overall Rating: 8.5 / 10 This is an outstanding Action RPG on its own, and is arguably even better then Diablo 3 which was released in the same year. Fans of the original Torchlight should definitely pick this up.",

            "review_text": "Torchlight II is the successor to Torchlight, an Action-RPG Dungeon Crawler-esque game that sends the player through countless dungeons and landscapes killing a variety of different monsters that may stand in their path in order to complete their quests.  Combat is very satisfying, weapons feel like they have weight and it feels great while using some of the bigger ones. Also, the enemies tend to explode. A lot.  The weapons are EXTREMELY diverse, though a lot of them look the same in sprite, and sometimes in-world, you will likely never see every weapon in several playthroughs as many have randomly generated quirks and/or effects. You really are spoiled for choice. Armour is very much the same.  There are a diverse selection of dungeon tiles ranging from Steampunky clockwork looks to haunted crypts and as the Dungeons are randomly generated (with some exceptions) it is unlikely that you'll see the same dungeon again.  Once the player completes the game, they unlock access to a place called the 'Mapworks' which allows the player to buy maps that correspond to their character's level (or not) and run a dungeon which is scaled to whatever map scroll they purchase. Some maps even have additional effects which can affect both the player and the monsters found within the dungeon.",

It is an excellent game, unique bosses, way too much loot, wonderfully customizable skills, a game that was truly made with care from the developers. It holds it's ground as an excellent game, laced with fun and really shows that the devs didn't care just for profit. It's really refreshing to see a game that has had this much care put into it. I will be playing it for hundreds more hours.  9.5/10  Very enjoyable gameplay, lots of loot, very rounded enemies with unique skills to kill you. Playing with friends is awesome, you can all level at the same time which is a great feature built in to this game.  It can sometimes have TOO much loot, but this isn't that much of a downside.

It's still got a great alternative view for the walls like in the first (silhouettes in red or blue instead of walls going see-through). The classes are a little more unique and I just love the 'level requirement or stat requirement' features. I've found myself playing this alone almost nonstop, whereas with the first I had to take breaks on occasion. An excellent game by an excellent team with more awesome music! A hard deal to beat for the low price, if you dig the old hack 'n slash rpgs you seriously need this game!",

Embermage (mage), outlander (ranged), Berserker (melee) and engineer (all)  you allways have a pet by your side you can send to town to sell your loot within 2 minutes at all times (you can get it down to 1 second with the right gear), the pet has defensive, offensive and neutral modes you can change at any time.  the game even have some easter eggs you can spot out if you take your time discovering the secrets of this well-made hack and slash type of game.  The internet/lan servers are working perfectly at all times, and i really enjoy playing with the people there.  but then again the bad part: the only two things I could complain about in this game  1st: the main story line... it stinks.. i still do not understand what i was doing, running around everywhere without a clue of what was going on. i run through it all being sent to other areas with no clue of what i actually had done to save the day for the villagers of the cities in all 4 acts.  2nd: the hackers... It's pretty normal finding a hacker among all internet games. but not this one. this has plenty of hackers. There is even a devided part of the game for modders and people who wants to use mods, but it is ruining the game with people that mods when they approach the non-modders.  so i would rate it 9/10, pretty good and my style of gaming but the real minus is all the hackers ruining the internet mode and the main story line.

Then I would say that look no further.  This game is filled with Diablo like experience with a very similar class, though only 4 and a customizable character (though not that recognizable in later levels).   The characters berserker, outlander, embermage, and engineer provides a different type of experience and mechanics that will entice players to try them all out. Different play style means replayability as you try to endulve yourself in whatever classes fits you most. I myself find enjoyment in playing a berserker as you try to slash your way through the dungeon head on.  The music is terrific for me, the ambience it portrays though not that memorable is very relevant to the game as it changes from places to places, providing a different kind of sensation when you enter a dungeon or out of the field.   Graphics are still great in my opinion, many may not be fond of how the game is portrayed graphically (as it may not be on par on other AAA games) but the graphics of this game justifies what it tries to accomplish. A fantasy adventure game with a bird's eye view of the gameplay.   There are 4 sets of difficulty and 2 modes, where hardcore are for the most veteran and expert players. One death and it is game over.   If you get tired of playing this game, there is also an option into modding the game. This game is worth more than what it is valued.  The only negative thing I have to say about this game is the online feature where if you have a Strict NAT you will have difficulty in actually playing with your friends. Both of us have Strict NAT and cannot play with each other. He bought this game to play with me, and I cannot even play with them unless LAN. Other than that the game is awesome. Would recommend it to my friends.  TL;DR  +Awesome gameplay/mechanics +A very diablo like feeling +Multiple classes +Great music +Good Graphics  -Strict NAT = no multiplayer (though fixable)  If there is anyone that knows how to fix multiplayer, please post a reply.",

I beat the game on Hardcore Normal which was pretty easy (Hardcore adding permadeath) but the game starts getting both funner and harder on Veteran and Elite difficulties. Story is alright, wasn't really too grasped by it but the dungeons were very atmospheric, especially the last part of the last act. Throw in secret rooms and levers hidden throughout and that makes dungeons much more interesting. The workshop is awesome, mods really breathe extra life into the game and add additional playstyle options such as extra classes, balance revisions, skins, pets, and even more dungeons and quests. Last, the pet system is pretty much the same from Fate, an ARPG I used to love when I was little because there was a free trial on my computer, where you choose a pet that helps in combat, you can feed him fish you catch to transform it temporarily or permanent grantining your pets certain buffs, and being able to send your pet back to town to conveniently sell your inventory.  8.5/10.

Hope you get good gear. Rinse and repeat. Even with this huge imperfection, the game is still fun to play/grind.  Modding content might spice things up but its still overall the same dish.  Also achives are great but some seem absurd...really 10 million gold? or even worse, have 50 friends? What?  Bottom line: 8.5/10  Great grinding diablo-esk adventure with some replayablilty.

Its a really solid, well done ARPG that plays like pretty much all the others. Has very nice effects for your attacks, good loot, and a nice sense of progression. The skill trees are expansive enough to somewhat force you to specialize in a few things, and diverse enough there are different ways to play each class. The game has excellent mod support and really shines when modded with the synergies mod and some additional class mods. I would strongly recommend doing this right away.    My only slight complaint is that the vanilla game (i.e. how it is without mods) only has 4 classes, melee characters are kinda harder to play, and the art style may or may not be to your liking. Personally I prefer something a bit less cartoonish but the upside is that it allows the game to run on much older hardware if you are like me and stuck with a crappy 6 year old laptop that cant even run Path of Exile, let alone Grim Dawn or Diablo 3. Anyway, if you even remotely think you will like this game, you are probably right and the hours of gameplay per dollar spent ratio is outstanding.",

I recommend to play on veteran at least).  Neutral: 0 Character classes are okay. Can't say that chaaecter design is extraordinary, it is good, but I expected more (more crazy skills: stealth, time-stopping, massive knock-backs etc.) 0 Environments are beautiful but not memorable (with one exception). 0 Story is 'meh'.  Cons: - After 1st playthrough, game is barely playable for me. I agree, the end-game is pretty good, however to reach that point, a lot of grinding has to be done. The worst part, grinding is painfully boring.  Conclusion: 19 euros is a proper price for this game. I bought it on sale - it was worth it. Great replayability, 4 character classes, hardcore mode, new game plus, Tarroch's Tomb and more.",

It scales well, it’s fun and it’s not heavy on the theorycraft of your build(unless you want it to be.) You pretty much just run around punching(or shooting/stabbing/etc) monsters and it’s really satisfying. My problem with this game, and it’s purely a personal problem, is that once you beat the game once the grinding aspects are forced on to you in NG+. Even if you do all the optional stuff on the map you still have to do bonus dungeons in order to stay at level for the story quests. I understand why this is a thing but I would like to run through the game again without all the grinding. The story is whatever and forgettable but it doesn’t negatively affect the game because the game isn’t about the story or the characters. Beautiful map designs and artwork to boot. Play it by yourself on normal or easy for the best experience.",

The visual style is nice and cartoony without being too wonky, and there's some neat little bits of humor sprinkled about here and there. The world feels genuine and familiar for any fantasy gamer and the enemies are varied but balanced.  The soundtrack bothers me, while it's excellently done and easy on the ear, it leans far too heavily on the first two Diablo games' soundtracks and doesn't quite fit the game's atmosphere. Many of the sound effects could also just as well be pulled directly from Diablo, as is the waypoint system, and the socketed items, portal and identify scrolls. I get it, it's made to feel familiar to Diablo fans and that's what appeals to me too, but some of these things just feel like lapses of imagination when the execution is so directly analogous.  It doesn't ruin the game though and the environments have more uniqueness to them, setting the game apart for its own good, and many of the more annoying features of D2 like constantly running back to town to sell stuff to make room in your inventory (you can have your pet do that for you) and playing tetris with your inventory to fit everything (items all occupy a single slot) have been left out.  Pros: +Nice visuals and smooth play even with lots of mobs on screen +Very good controls +The pet is a lifesaver +Takes the good stuff in D2 and leaves out the bad +Game difficulty options cater to a wide audience +Map design is refreshing while staying true to the genre  Cons: -Unimaginative in some parts, especially the soundtrack  Torchlight II is an homage to Diablo 2 and brings it to the 21st century, introducing some neat new features without significantly altering the overall gameplay, and yet manages to remain a game of its own. 8,5/10.",

I'm a guy with a particular love for that style.. Played Baldur's Gate / Champions Of Norrath on PS2, Diablo III on Xbox 360, The Adventures of Van Helsing . .. That's why my dream is that one day the devs can add controller support for that so well made game. Got one copy, and still waiting the controler support to buy 3 more copies for my friends.",
