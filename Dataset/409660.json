            "review_text": "Much, much better this time around. The AVGN game series pays homage to classic games, particularly run-and-guns like Mega Man. It also is packed with watered down versions of some of the worst and nonsensical video game tropes, albeit without making the game a chore to play, as well as AVGN's own non-blocking commentary throughout the game.  The first game was good, but suffered from overly simplistic controls and its short length. In this one, in lieu of multiple characters, you get direction locking for firing and permanent upgrades based on NES accessories the Nerd donned during various cinematic sequences. (particularly the Nerd vs. Rob the Robot) This really streamlines the overall experience as you don't have to fiddle with awkward character switches and sudden control changes as a result.   As for its length, it's probably about 1.5x to 2x longer than the original, about equivalent to Mega Man X1-X3. There are 16 full-length levels (individual levels are shorter than in the original), the tutorial level (which is hilariously replayable), 8 miniboss fights in those levels including the tutorial one, and 6 boss-only levels for a total of 23. Your first run will probably last 2-3 hours but speedrunners could cut it to maybe 30-40 minutes or so, menus and cutscenes included.  The soundtrack is a mix of old and new tracks, but its scope reflects the longer length of this title.  Difficulty...it's almost  objectively  easier than the original. Hard (Old School) is the new Normal, since that difficulty still gives you kegs. (a secondary that recovers your health) The next difficulty (Hard as Balls) gives you only 2 beers and no kegs, (and nothing that replaces them either) shooting the difficulty of boss fights into the stratosphere.   GAMEPADS : It seems they've added support for non-DirectInput gamepads, like the various SNES controller clones. AVGN 1 did not have this. Good for them for adding this support...it's a lot of fun playing an old-school game with a rigid dpad like NES/SNES had.  Last but not least, the humor and meta-references are surprisingly strong considering how they blew through so much A-material in the first game. The AVGN movie, the 'feud' with the Nostalgia Critic, and Board James are the three major untapped wells they drew from and it all came together pretty well. Nostalgia Critic plays a role similar to Break Man/Proto Man in Mega Man 3 (plus his pattern is very similar), though it ultimately goes in a very different direction.   EDIT : One downside worth mentioning is it seems that boss patterns are way more RNG than in the first game. Minibosses and the Area 51 boss are especially RNG. This is somewhat compensated by 'easier' high difficulty modes which give you more than 1 health and infinite continues, but it can become very frustrating nonetheless. This is still a minor issue.  Needless to say, AVGN fans who like run-and-gun platformers should find this one enjoyable.",

The difficulty varies between levels and depending on the difficulty setting quite a bit, so chances are whaever you preference on that you can one that's fun.  Finally I don't normally like the 'retro style' trend that occurs on Steam quite a bit, but this is an example of it done right, although pixelated it looks beatuful, the colours are rich, particle effects are satisfying the music is awesome.  All in all it is an excellent game and is well worth the price",

This game also takes a huge drop in difficulty from the first one, however that makes the game more fun in my opinion. What really made the first game so hard was those ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t insta kill blocks, and although they do make an apparence in this game as well they are nowhere near as bad or as many. So all in all, the drop in difficulty benefits the game, this one is a lot more fun then the first one. The power ups are great and all feel usefull, really worth to go out of your way to get em all. I really hope to see some DLC in the future for this, hopefully a mode where you can play as the Nostalgia Critic or a characther from the nerd universe like Board James. All in all this game is pretty short, but it was a blast to play threw. So if you like old school NES platformers like Megaman this game is defiently worth it.",

I can see what's actually happening onscreen roughly 50% of the time. I cannot get past the very first platforming section of the intro tutorial stage. The music seems pretty freakin' boss from the one tune I'm able to hear though.  This is apparently an issue for enough people that a fix is being worked on, but that was posted in April. I'll gladly buy back in if this is actually fixed, but I need to take the refund route for now. Promises of solutions are worth very little in this industry until they're actually followed through on.",

To say this differently, they have purposely made a game to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• of AVGN fans. The people who like to play dragon's lair on NES and laugh at how bad it is, the ones who like the challenge of Bart's jumps in ‚ÄúBart vs the space mutants‚Äù or who play any game with the powerglove, these are the people who might like this game. What the developers seem to have missed is that why AVGN is popular is partially because he pointed at problems we all agree on. So what they should of done is to create a game without any of those flaws instead of incorporating all of them.   I feel like I'm going in to a rant here. Instead of just aggravating myself and pointing at every detail I will just hope that this overall guide of what this game is, will scare you away from buying it. On the other hand, so did AVGN when he did his first review of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde‚Ä¶ May god save us all.   PS: It works on LINUX!",

It's a sidescrolling platformer packed with challange, humor, innovative and colorful level design and a kickass soundtrack that anyone can enjoy. Aside from your normal platforming challanges, it also contains levels based on shooting, swimming, walljuming, anti-gravity and more! Its biggest flaw is that it is a bit short (only around 4 hours to play all the way through) but kinda makes up for that with its sizeable ammount of collectables that can be challanging to find and collect.  For those who played the first game in this series: This game is a marked improvement over the first one in the series due to having more stages, more fun mechanics (wall jumping, swimming, anti-gravity and more) and it goes for a 'tough but fair' approach to level design rather than the first game's '‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t but beatable' idea. You don't feel like you're bashing your head off a wall with this game. There's less death blocks (but you'll still see plenty of them, don't worry) and instead of gameplay being split into collecting different characters, you focus on collecting powerups for the Nerd.  Overall I'd rate it a solid 8/10. My only complaints are that the game should be a bit longer and the final boss is a bit underwhelming.",

            "review_text": "Pretty fun game, I recommand giving it a play. While I do think there are some improvement since the previous game, I also think there are a couple of backlashes.  Things that I do like: 1.Upgrades! This is always a good thing. 2.New mechanisms like wall jump and swimming.   I especaiily like that audio goes underwater as well when your swimming. 3.Wolrds/Sections. While the previous game had one theme per stage,   this one has different smaller themes under the main there.  Now things that annoy me: 1.I feel most of the good gags are used in the previous game and they're left with the ones that aren't so hilarious.  With that said, there are a couple of awesome AVGN moments but not as epic as the first game. 2.I think the music in the first game is way better. 3.Text. You can mesh through text but that's about it. I wish you can just press start to skip the entire dialogue.  The action starts as soon as the dialogue ends and it's hard for me to know exactly when I should start moving.  Worst of all, the text can sometimes block the game play so you can't see clearly. 4.This is the biggest one: I feel the control is not very smooth  I'm not sure if it's because of the Unity engine or they program it like this,   For example, when I try to shoot a charge shot and charge the next one immdiately,  instead of shooting, the Nerd just keeps charging  I just fell the control is not as good as the previous game.  I don't know...or maybe I'm just bad :(  This is a good game. It's just not a masterpeice like the previous one.",

The first thing that annoys me is, that you hold on to a wall with your feet, not with your hand, which means, if you don't hit the lowest pixel of a wall with the lowest pixel of your foot you won't hold on to it. But what really pisses me off is, that if you let go off the controller you still hold on to the wall. There are several games of this genre with this wall-slide mechanic (the most prominent is Mega Man X). In every one of this games you have to hold the control stick/d-pad against the wall to hold on to it and if you let go, you fall down straight, which is the reason I died 93485793875 times in this game.

James is yet again thrown into a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• game and our reluctant hero has to save the world once again. Thus, his journey continues along with countless F-bombs, beer and monsters to dismember.  ASSimilation is the kind of game that has a good length when you factor in replays on the harder difficulties. Sure, you can plow through it on normal mode in two to three hours but the real challenge (similarly to oldschool classics) is to beat the game on harder, seemingly impossible difficulties. Making no mistake, the game is hard as balls, as simple as that.  Though I wouldn't necessarily recommend the game at full price for those who are new to this genre, whenever it's on sale, do grab it and have a blast!",

One of the biggest changes this time around is that the levels are each split in to four smaller stages accessible via a world map. This actually makes the game quite a bit easier, especially since the main bosses of each area can be attempted directly from the map instead of having to make it through a large level beforehand.   Another change is that the other selectable characters ( Mike, Guitar Guy etc. ) have been ditched in favor of collecting armor pieces which each offer the Nerd new upgrades and abilities.   Overall though I felt that the game was a little on the short side and even stopping to collect all the N-E-R-D cartridge pickups didn't seem to add a lot of additional mileage. I also felt that the jokes and references weren't quite as good this time around and some of the traps and pitfalls in the game were more frustrating than challenging.  If you are a fan of the Angry Video Nerd series then you are still likely to enjoy this game, however if you are unfamiliar with the Nerd and are simply looking for a good retro-themed platformer then the first Angry Video Game Adventures would probably be a better place to start.",
