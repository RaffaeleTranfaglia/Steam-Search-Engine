            "review_text": "Not ready for prime time. I liked Crimson Skies, and this game attempts to emulate much of what made that a fun game. There are a lot of rough edges: random crashes in the middle of a mission, a mission that does not end even when you completed all the objectives, visual effects that suddenly pop up, collisions with objects that you are near but have not in fact collided with, etc. I really do hope they spend the effort to fix this one up. The graphics are fine, not cutting edge, but there is a real need for a game in this genre.",
