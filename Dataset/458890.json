Vive controllers are implemented well and UI looks nice and is easy to navigate. Video's can be streamed as well if you have a decent connection, or downloaded if you don't want to risk buffering.   I recommend the U2 - Songs of Innocence clip, which is done very well.",

            "review_text": "Prepare to get sick!   Disclaimer first though: I only watched 4 of the videos, and only one entirely. Maybe with other movies the experience would be different.  I suspect that most of my issues is either a technology limitation and bad video capture or post-processing. But still, the software without the content is useless. So bad content = bad rating :)  - Only the head orientation is tracked, not its position. If you move forward or backward or sideways, the image follows you. Of course, there isn't much that can be done here. The software only shows videos, not 3D world, so it can only put the head at the same position as the camera. It can't create the parallax effect needed. But all the same, this is going to make people sick and give them vertigo.  - Sometimes, there is a doubling of the image especially visible in high contrast areas. I suspect this is a post-processing issue, when what was captured by two cameras couldn't align correctly, like when stitching poor quality photos to make a panoramic. You can see a somewhat similar effect in the helicopter screenshot above, where one of the blade looks cut (although in this case it might be because of the speed of the blade compared to the camera shutter and not a stitching problem, but the effect is similar).  - Sometimes, it felts like the image was composed of 2D objects put in layers, like for shadow puppets. The people were like 2D images put in a 3D world. Like my first point, it's quite possible it feels that way because of the lack of parallax.  - I have had tracking issues too. I don't know if it's the Within software, or the Vive/SteamVR, or a sync problem with the lighthouses. But sometimes, I was turning my head to look at what was behind me or to the side, only to have the video recenter on my headset again so that I was facing the 'front' of the video even though my head was turned.  - There was some sound issues too. I've had a similar one with some other VR software so maybe it's my setup. But anyway, when slowly turning my head, the sound would slowly fade out, then if I kept turning my head in the same direction, or turn it forward again, the sound would fade in.  ",
