There are some blatant bugs I have seen when playing, just a handful of them are that sometimes the round ends and it says 'No survivors!' when it's clear some people are still alive, the game tends to crash a lot, I couldn't play without some people lagging all over the place, some text is in another language, and some more. Some things that pain me is that paying for premium is temporary (which I will get to later), grenades are a one-time use and you have to buy them again, and that you scrape up so little money after a match in comparison with the price of some of the guns, most of your money accumulating from leveling up, which is $500 a level.  Now, I understand there being a premium in a game, just some option you don't have to buy that gives you some neat stuff, and you get to keep that. Here, premium is temporary, and I immediately disapprove of temporary anything in video games. I want to buy something that stays there forever, not something that stays there for a day or so.  I give this game a 3/10 allah akbars.   Praise the sun.",

I'll list some of the more noteworthy factors that make this game so trashy:  &gt;Insanely bad sound design.  &gt;Horrible server connections/high ping overall/laggy hitreg.  &gt;No tutorial whatsoever.  &gt;Certain aspects were clearly ripped off from CS:GO.  &gt;High potential for hackers, though I did not play enough to confirm this.  &gt;Broken english/Russian language in various places.  &gt;Game crashed twice within 3-4 minutes of playing?!  &gt;Microtransactions?! Not sure how pay-to-win it gets, but I'm assuming its pretty bad...  &gt;No Steam Achievements or Trading Cards, meaning there's even less of a reason to play this garbage.  At least this game wasn't a large install because it was a massive waste of time to even give this game the benefit of the doubt.  The developers probably just put this game up on Steam hoping to make a few quick bucks off of the microtransactions from people with either too much money/time on their hands and/or people with too few brain cells in their heads.  I would 100% recommend you download this game and idle in it for five minutes so that you can then write a review about it explaining how bad it is and why.",

The first few minutes you'll like it but after a while you come to the conclusion that you need to buy good expensive guns with real money.  If you are going to try to get the good weapons for free you will have to play the game for a verry dissapointing time. Wich will take more than a few hours maby weeks or even months.  The quality of the graphics are just like one of those 'Minecraft' related games wich sometimes are such a ripoff and don't work well like this game.  I advise you not to play it because it takes to much time and inorder to have fun you'll need to pay actual money.",

(Sometimes like person comes out of the wall and kills you instantly pretty scary sometimes ';D) P.S to every one who`s crashing just don`t press ok on report just go in game and keep playing :) Ty for this free game.

But she had an enchantment   upon her of a fearful sort which could   only be broken by love's first kiss.   She was locked away in a castle guarded   by a terrible fire-breathing dragon.   Many brave knights had attempted to   free her from this dreadful prison,   but non prevailed. She waited in the   dragon's keep in the highest room of   the tallest tower for her true love   and true love's first kiss. (laughs)   Like that's ever gonna happen. What   a load of - (toilet flush)    Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his   day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go   after the ogre.    NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME   MAN1  Think it's in there?   MAN2  All right. Let's get it!   MAN1  Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that   thing can do to you?    MAN3  Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's   bread.    Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.   SHREK  Yes, well, actually, that would be a   giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse.   They'll make a suit from your freshly   peeled skin.    MEN  No!   SHREK  They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the   jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's   quite good on toast.    MAN1  Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya!   (waves the torch at Shrek.)    Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The   men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long   and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the   men are in the dark.    SHREK  This is the part where you run away.   (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.)   And stay out! (looks down and picks   up a piece of paper. Reads.) 'Wanted.   Fairy tale creatures.'(He sighs and   throws the paper over his shoulder.)      THE NEXT DAY   There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard   sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures   to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line   are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto   who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three   little pigs.    GUARD  All right. This one's full. Take it   away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!      HEAD GUARD  Next!   GUARD  (taking the witch's broom) Give me that!   Your flying days are over. (breaks the   broom in half)    HEAD GUARD  That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch.   Next!    GUARD  Get up! Come on!   HEAD GUARD  Twenty pieces.   LITTLE BEAR  (crying) This cage is too small.   DONKEY  Please, don't turn me in. I'll never   be stubborn again. I can change. Please!   Give me another chance!    OLD WOMAN  Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)   DONKEY  Oh!   HEAD GUARD  Next! What have you got?   GIPETTO  This little wooden puppet.   PINOCCHIO  I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his   nose grows)    HEAD GUARD  Five shillings for the possessed toy.   Take it away.    PINOCCHIO  Father, please! Don't let them do this!   Help me!    Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up   to the table.    HEAD GUARD  Next! What have you got?   OLD WOMAN  Well, I've got a talking donkey.   HEAD GUARD  Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings,   if you can prove it.    OLD WOMAN  Oh, go ahead, little fella.   Donkey just looks up at her.   HEAD GUARD  Well?   OLD WOMAN  Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little   nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox.   Talk, you boneheaded dolt...    HEAD GUARD  That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!      OLD WOMAN  No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends   to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to   talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing   you ever saw.    HEAD GUARD  Get her out of my sight.   OLD WOMAN  No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!   The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One   of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's   hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled   with fairy dust and he's able to fly.    DONKEY  Hey! I can fly!   PETER PAN  He can fly!   3 LITTLE PIGS  He can fly!   HEAD GUARD  He can talk!      ",
