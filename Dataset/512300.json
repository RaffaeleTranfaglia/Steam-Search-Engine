            "review_text": "Unbox has quickly and mercilessly shattered all of my expectations to become one of my favorite games of 2016. Unbox is the harbinger of the Rare-vival. Many of us feel the warm nostalgies for our classic collectathons such as Banjo-Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64 and we crave something new in this genre. But it's not the genre that we really miss. It's that wonderful personality that those games had. That goofy sense of humor, that hilarious cartoon approach to characters that made us feel like we'd jumped into a saturday morning cartoon. That's what Unbox nails. That's why you should play this game. Unbox is fun, the mechanics are great, the graphics look good, the music is a delight but all of that is secondary to the amazing personality that this game brings to the table. I didn't get this game for free, I'm not biased, I'm just a huge advocator of people having fun and this game is pure joy in a box.  Here's a video review for those of you who need to see my wonderful face to be convinced of what I just told you:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  Unbox Review: Dawn of the Rare-Vival?&nbsp;",

It wouldn't be a problem, but as of now I am on the second world and the game forces you to drive to get a stamp.  But aside from that.

            "review_text": "Super fun collection adventure platformer with obvious inspiration from N64 era platformers. The physics are very interesting, it's fun learning how to control the momentum of a rolling jumping cardboard box. The worlds you explore are huge for a box and offer all sorts of variety and nooks and crannies. The shooting mini-games sort of suck because there's not exactly an aiming mechanism, but you can get over that by just jumping on your enemies and pray and spraying. Graphics are good enough, might want to add some anti-aliasing using your GPU control panel. Screenshots on the Store page look staged and slightly edited, but do reflect the gameplay very well/  Overall, a super fun game. Glad I picked this up.",

I was hoping for a bit more actual platforming though, it's more open world adventure game than platforming game. Assuming a big enough community could support it, I could see very good online multiplayer for this game as well!",

            "review_text": "Very simple physics focused game that feels like those 'Roll the Ball to the Goal' quick releases, but sudden comes to life as a colourful and quirky classic N64 Collectathon Platformer that has been missing from the industry since titles such as Mario 64, Banjo &amp; Kazooie, Crash Bandicoot, and similar popular titles.  It's main mechanic has you strategizing your platform jumping with your 'extra jump' (unpack) ability- which gives you a boost of height and movement- at the sacrifice of a peg off your limited health. It's surprisingly enjoyable, and definitely one of the better indie titles on Steam. Worth a try.  NOTE (27/10/2016): This is currently on sale at HUMBLE BUNDLE, as well as on Steam with a Free Demo, so go have a good time.",

No DLC, no microtransactions, you pay one price, you get a fun game, you play through it once or twice, and it stands on its own as a great single player exprience. That's what this is. There are some things that could be improved about this game, but the fact is that I couldn't keep from smiling while playing it. Collect-a-thon platformers are back, baby, and they're back with a vengeance!",

            "review_text": "I have to say that Unbox is exactly as advertised and a little more; a beautiful throwback to the N64-era 3D platformers. Down to nearly every detail, it will remind you of those wonderful days of gaming.  The physics are far superior to anything that could have been offered in the late 90's, as are the graphics (but without seeming too flashy). They retain the cartoon, polygon appearance we all love, and the spirit of those games is upheld even in the characters 'speaking'  I only really have one complaint about this game, and it pains me to admit it, but it has made me start to lose interest just a tad. In the 3D platformers (actually all platformers, back to the NES), there were lots of short levels where you could feel a sense of accomplishment, many times, over a few hours. This game doesn't really do that for me.  I enjoy open-world games as much as anyone else, but in many other successful games there's still incremental payoffs that occur fairly frequently ie. deeply interesting story and accomplishments or brief challenges with frequent minor rewards along the way. I did not get that with this game.  I would play another game in this style, from the same dev's, again for sure. But I would really hope for twice the levels/worlds and 2/3's the collectibles per level. At that point it would be absolutely equal to Banjo-Kazooie or Mario 64, or all the other fantastic games this emulates. Hands down.  7/10",

I know there are alot of gamers that are on windows 7 but can you PLEASE optimize the game for windows 8 and 10.

            "review_text": "This is one game whose metascore I very much disagree with. Polished like the biggest jewel on the crown of a king, this quirky platformer generates a feeling I haven't felt for a long, long time. With surprisingly great controls, high mobility, very shiny graphics, and delightful music, Unbox coalesces all of its strengths into an experience that simultaneously feels grand and innocent. This is the kind of game of which I would have strong, fond memories, had it come out when I was a child.  I think those critics just don't get it, and are applying an inappropriate set of standards. You wouldn't evaluate the animation of a Disney movie with the same standards with which you would evaluate a painting from the Renaissance era, would you? No, you wouldn't. That would be stupid.  Ignore the metascore. This game is one to experience -- it's cute, ridiculous, satisfying, and surprisingly large.",

            "review_text": "This game has a lot of heart it really does. I love the box rolling mechanic, I think it's incredibly fun. Here are a couple of the main reasons why I don't reccomend this game despite the game's charm and appeal.  First, right off the bat, the game has long unskipable cutscenes which wouldnt be a problem if it's not for what comes next in the list.  Second, the map design in the game is great and a lot of fun. The problem is there is this mechanic in the game called UNBOX which essentially uses a life to launch you great distances. which ends up turning this map that, at the start of the game seemed overwhelmingly large. To a much smaller map due to your increase in speed and mobility. It turned all the obstacles into non-problems. This was killer for me. and what made it worse was:  Third: You unlock all your abilities at the start of the game. This is what turned me off of the game. This game has a lot of potential without the UNBOX abliity The tutorial levels where you can't use it are really fun. They should have waited till later in the game to give it to you. You can really see the developers struggle to make interesting missions with this ability simply due to how overpowered it is.  Fourth: The missions in this game struggle to keep the game interesting. I hate to say it, but they really do. This is for a couple reasons. One, the story itself can't really figure out it's main purpose so they really just drop you in and say 'have fun' with no real reason why you need to do these missions. Plus most of the missions are completely inconsistent in difficulty and time to complete. This game has collectables similar to banjo-kazooie as you are probably aware. But the main 'stamp' collectable is what gets you essentially to the next level. But one mission can take you less then a minute to complete saying 'go here'. And others that are whole races which you need to get 3 gold metals to get one stamp. I think this just goes back to the developers trying to accomadate for the UNBOX launch.  Fifth and Finally: The story. The reason this is last is because in these collectathon games story is ususally of minimal importance. BUT! This story is particularly confusing. Lets get some of the minor gripes right off the bat. Other characters have somewhat inconsistant personalities but tend to stay true to their 'Archetype'. The major problem I have with the story is the fact that the developers never actually figured out a driving force. You start the game as 'The box that will save the shipping company' which is a fantastic premise. Then they go on to the first main 'open world' island. And tell you 'oh forget about it, go and have fun doing our missions'. It just never feels like you are making any progress despite beating the boss, and going through levels.  tl;dr Game has fun mechanics and a fun story and interesting level design, but is dwarfed by game breaking powerups that should have been locked till the end of the game, a story which loses purpose within the first 20 minutes of playing, and challenges which fail to remain interesting for long periods of play.  The developers show a lot of potential in this game, and I can't wait to see what they come up with next. Given a chance to learn from their mistakes with this game. Hopefully the next one is fantastic.  EDIT:  I've been informed by Cancer's Spooky Cousin* that you can now skip cutscenes  *I know",
