Well I guess it's worth a try..'' -10 minutes in- ''OH MY GOD WHAT IS THIS I'M LIKE JET BRUCE CHAN OR SOMETHING YES!'' -20 minutes later, meet a wolf- *insert 20 wolf beatings here*  Be prepared for maximum, legendary frustration..Or atleast, it frustrated me..It all starts out pretty easy, especialy when you find the staff weapon (bunny smacking!), but good god the wolves. Try to image my face when I met 3 of these §$@&amp;!s after spending a good 15 minutes on beating one.. I have yet to complete this game, but I can already tell you it's hard..really hard.. Maybe that's just my fighting game handicap that likes to show up when there are more then 2 dimensions but still..   It lures you with the whole ''oh, bunnies!And they fight!Haha!'' thing and proceeds to throw a bucket of unvoluntairy-sexual-intercourse straight in your excrement-depository-hole. ",

            "review_text": "Played this game long before it was on steam and loved it a lot. It has a very fast paced fighting mechanic that is very flexible. An enemy is jumping over you? Grab him and slam him into the ground. There are many hidden techniques to discover and master. The game is full of physical details that you may not expect.  The health system is very interesting because it is a mix of heal over time and permanent damage mechanics. A series of blows can weaken you a bit but you can recover from it if you get out of there. Being cut by a sword though will permanently hurt you and you can eventually bleed out.  Weapons can give you an edge but there is still a lot of detail in their use. You can throw knives but your enemy can catch them if they notice. A sword can end a fight quickly but the AI is pretty good at countering it and even stealing it right out of your grasp.  The levels are a series of missions that involve killing all the enemies. You are offered many choices in how to approach a level. Whether you stealthily take them on one by one, or jump into the middle of a group and mostly likely get wrecked. The story is a revenge story which is simple but presented very well.  Enemies vary in strength with wolves being the most powerful and can kick you across the map if they hit you right. Mostly you will be fighting other bunnies.  Graphically this is an old game and looks a bit like Morrowind but it does have some cool graphical tricks. Blood splatter is one that will attract your attention. Characters bleed realistically when cut or have their faces smashed. Models are great and the animation is pretty fantastic.  The sounds of the game consist of lot's of natural animal sounds with good impact sounds. Fight music is really memorable and gets your blood pumping.  Overall this is a very fun 3rd person brawler and the next game Overgrowth is a great successor to the game.",

Playing as a kung-fu rabbit didn’t really interest me, but then the poorly-written story and high difficulty of the campaign made me like it even less than I expected. The tutorial teaches you 10 or so combo moves all at the same time, which for me meant I never really learned any of them. It probably would have worked better to introduce them throughout the campaign, but it seemed more focused on the fighting engine than a game.",

Also for my computer I am running Ubuntu 16.10, 32 gigs of ram, AMD 8370 and a GTX 960. My steam drive is a Samsung 120 gig 840 series. For the video card driver version I am running 367.35. This game had a few issues like the wolves seem almost next to impossible to kill on Normal mode. With the next game coming out Overgrowth I am hoping for a lot better store line and more balanced enemies as well.",
