Trial Bike was the game that was fun to fail at just to see those amusing ragdoll physics. Besides that, it consisted of the player attempting to get their rider across a two dimensional course. Trials Evolution is merely an extension of this experience, but in a much more polished and intriguing format.    There are two modes; career, as well as online and local multiplayer, all of which have a level of depth that was not realized in the free yet fun to play Trial Bike. Career mode sees your rider climb the tiers of your motorcycle licencing system by running test courses for D, C, B, and A class licences respectively. After you complete a licence, you get to participate in a series of tracks that will test the skills you’ve learned while progressing through your licences. These tracks range from beautiful back country vistas to more classic settings like warehouses and construction sites, each are beautiful in their own way. The game has just built on the foundation that its predecessor has laid, not losing its identity along the way. The level of fun you will have while playing Trials evolution are doubled from Trial Bike, with the inclusion of stellar graphics, a fitting heavy alternative rock sound track, and a deep level of rider and bike customisation. You can also play player modded tracks that can often offer a higher level of challenge. Another thing that is charming in its own way is the way that your rider will shout “YEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHH!” and exclaims in other ways that’ll put a smile on your face while you pull off big airs and flips.   Trials Evolution Gold Edition on the pc is a dream both visually and in terms of playability. Keyboard and gamepad work perfectly, and it’s likely that you’ll be maxing out all the graphical bells and whistles while maintaining at least sixty frames per second on a decent rig. While playing split screen multiplayer one player can use keyboard controls while the other uses the gamepad. If you have two gamepads then both players can use them.    Trials Evolution Gold provides a unique driving experience that cannot be replicated elsewhere in the world of videogames, provides a tremendous amount of good old fun and is a beautiful thing to look at. I urge you to pick this up on Steam or Uplay at full price or if there’s a sale going on even better. Even if you’re not into motorsport in the slightest you will not regret buying this for the hours of fun you’ll receive out of it.  10/10  Also note that sometime early in the second quarter of 2014 (April 24th) the sequel will be released: Trials Fusion, which promises more of the same but with upgraded visuals I hope, and a whole slew of new tracks set in various settings not featured in this installment such as deserts snow peaked mountains and what looks like futuristic cities.

I'm not interested in Uplay, but I have to sign up with them or I just threw my money away. Now I have yet another service that wants to send me spam mail, and force feed me advertisements for other games I might be interested in buying from them.   I know some people won't be bothered by this and may even think I'm making too big of a deal out of it. But I remember when you just bought a game and played it without having to give your personal info away. Ahh, the good old days.  Well you got me Uplay.

There's nothing to jump out from the shadows, nothing that is going to stab you in the back. The only surprises in the game get you once, and from then on, it's your fault. This game has tight controls, diversity, infinitely challenging replay on so many levels. Playing this game inspires hate from the moment you hear the music, and everything you love about this game drives you up the wall. The more you play, the better you get, and the worse you do. You will hate your life, and you will likely consider suicide, but this game is worth it. It is so gratifying once you get it right. EVERYTHING in this game fills you with rage, and inspires high blood pressure, increased heartbeat, and compulsive cursing. The 'restart' button will be your most pressed; it will be your best friend, and your worst enemy. You will cry. You will scream. You will uninstall in anger. You will reinstall and torture yourself over and over to try and just barely scrape past your own limits. You will love it, sigh in relief, and feel so gratified that you know it's worth it.  This game will ruin you, and you will rise from the ashes of your former self, only to burn away again and again.",

Smooth interface, VERY fast load times from startup to loading levels; definitely a 'pickup-and-play' game when you wanna kill 15 minutes or so. The physics are probably the best part, and add to the humor tremendously. And with the level builder built-in, there is a strong community of user made levels that you can download for endless replayability and challenge.

Uplay is EXTREMELY BUGGY and in some cases won't work at all, and if Uplay doesn't work, neither will Trials. They ARE working to fix it, but I don't think it will be any time soon.  Next, Trails is a poorly ported Xbox360 game, so they are STILL doing bug fixes. Even on the highest end computers it will have a jitter effect, because the game is locked on 60 fps (Which is good if it's on a console, not if it's on a computer.) They ARE working on a fix, but I doubt it will work the first try so it will be a while before they get it sorted out, if at all. For me, the jitter effect is small enough that the game is playable, but it still annoys me.  Here's why you SHOULD buy it:  The game is amazing, the graphics are great for such a simple game, and the customization in the game is astounding. The game can be a lot of things, it's not just a motorcycle game, there are plenty of options to choose from. The online gameplay is really smooth, and connection problems don't seem to be an issue from what I've seen. Singleplayer has tons of gameplay put into it, and it does have a level of difficulty, but not enough to leave you stuck. It makes sure you are putting some effort into it, though, which is very nice for a game. It certaintly isn't a waste of money, and I'm sure it will be expanded on and improved, especially with bug fixes and whatnot.",

It is in my nature to get addicted to incredibly hard and frustrating skill games and it is one of the best. I have very little bad to say about that game.  The sequel moved to 360, which was really sad and upsetting that they ditched the fan base that supported them. After a few years, they announced the return to PC which was good news! It uses Uplay which is fine but I would prefer that it didn't. I would prefer full integration with Steam friends.  Then it arrived. I started playing it. I got addicted again. I was 100% most of the game. I hated the game but couldn't stop playing it. Most of this came down to the horrible bugginess of the game. It would have huge FPS drops and jitter. The black and white level is almost unplayable. In a game that requires accurate timing, the bugs required me to mess up over and over again. The replays were also useless and didn't work properly.  I will move away from the bugs to the actual gameplay.  I much prefer playing on keyboard. Some of the harder levels with really steep inclines clearly were more designed for a controller but are possible with keyboard after pain staking trial and error. The dynamic camera in the game is frustrating, I much preferred Trials 2 static side on camera. In this game, it is common to have blind jumps that you have to memorize. The one level that is 18 minutes long (If I remember rightly), is horrible. I don't like having to repeat a level that long.  Otherwise, this game is amazing. The level designs are great. Controls feel satisfying. 100% this game is incredibly hard and equally satisfying and I did get very addicted.  I will say I do recommend this game but it is a gamble with the bugs. If you have an older graphics card, I imagine the gamble is higher.",

Even better if you have a couple of friends to compete with on the leadersboards or play a bit of multiplayer. You can even make your own tracks in the editor which is pretty easy to get started in, but advanced enough to make crazy minigames and really slick looking tracks.  If the game will actually run at all for you that is.  It seems to be a coin-toss if this game will work on your system or not, and if it actually does run it might still lag even with really good hardware. I'm running it with a HD7970 and an i7 3770k so it runs well just because of the brute force. My laptop on the other hand has a decent high end i7 (for a laptop) and a HD8870M and I can't even run the game on low settings in 680x480 (for reference, the laptop can run Battlefield 4 on low sort of okay in 1080p) without having lag. Other people have problems with the game not starting at all or crashing frequently.  EDIT: Track central is now fixed and works just as well as it does on Xbox 360, removed the 'it's not working very well part'.  It also has DRM in the form of uPlay, which will start when you try and start the game from Steam. It was pretty terrible in the beginning but seems to have improved a bit over the year (still would rather not have it). uPlay also handles the multiplayer part of the game if you want to make private games with friends and that part is incredibly broken too. Pressing invite from the in-game friendslist just crashes my game and I'm one of the lucky ones that it's the only problem I'm having with it.  To sum things up I would recommend the game if I knew it would work properly, but with all the problems it has it really seems to be dumb luck wether it will work. The infrequent patches haven't done much to remedy the situation in the last few months so I honestly cannot recommend it when it's so broken for a big portion of the people that bought it.",

You'd think the PC version would be better - especially since this series started on PC, right? ... right?  Wrong: PC version of Evolution does not contain the DLC available for the XBLA version, nor is it available at all. Including the tracks from HD was nice - but why leave the rest out?  Ah, Ubisoft. They'd sooner correct you on your interpretation of their carefully crafted misleading statements than actually address a consumer issue. That's exactly what they've done here in the forums. #effubisoft  I bought this game on Steam because I wanted to replay one of my favorites, taking full advantage of the better hardware on my PC. To some degree, that's what I got - the game (mostly) runs at 60 fps @ 1080p - which is great and all - but this version suffers from some real problems... and let's face it - this is Ubisoft we're talking about. They have no intentions of fixing them.   The Problems:  - Uplay (the creamy filling inside Satan's ♥♥♥-pimples)  - Poor optimization: stuttering (bad in a game of skill)  - Graphical glitches: mainly all the sprites on screen flickering in unison (distracting in a game of skill)  - Poor multiplayer functionality (some of the most fun I've had with T:E on Xbox is with multiplayer)  - Social media integration that can't be turned off (some might see this as a plus, but I see it as Ubisoft listening too much to focus groups - if I wanted to do stuff like post my replays to youtube, I'd buy a bloody capture card - and nobody I know wants to see the facebook logo in between every match.)  - As stated above, DLC was never released despite 'Gold Edition' title and misleading statement about 'all' content being included. (As a developer pointed out, the statement was not technically inaccurate - but as many forum-goers have said, the statement is all too easy to misinterpret, especially given industry conventions.)  - Uplay (Uplay)",

Because of this, you have to create a seperate Uplay account and install Uplay to even get it up and running.   After you get into the game, very few user made levels will load for you. The game itself is great though, so it's really a shame that it has so many issues outside of the actual gameplay. Sometimes, after crashing during a run, the game will say that you have a new personal record even if you have made it much further than that run. You could even crash on the starting line and get a record! This causes a ton of wait time as you have to wait for the new best time to process and save before restarting the level.   The MAIN problem that I had was that even after exiting the game and completely closing Uplay, steam still said I was in game. This is a MAJOR issue. There was no way to take myself out of the game, and this made it impossible to play another game on steam or even close steam. Even going to the task manager and ending the application didn't work. Only restarting my computer finally took me out of the game and that simply cannot happen every time you want to play Trials. That's just a terrible port.",

Some nuances of the control scheme bother me far more than in previous Trials games. I'm not a fan of this one, and Trials Fusion seems much worse still.   Rating:   DON'T BUY THIS  ",
