I did end up looking up a lot of answers.They threw in some math and science, which is not my strong point, but I am happy I learned how to read Celtic runes, some Celtic history and *spoiler here* even learned about the periodic table and other cool science stuff i won't spoil for you. One thing i love about the games, they are good for stretching your mind as well as learning. The story line was ok, the characters kind of annoyed me but... i did want to get to the bottom of what was going on. Also, This one was weird because you could actually walk around as Nancy when you were outside. The Irish theme was cute, i liked some of the irish themed puzzles/games. Overall I enjoyed the experience and am glad i bought the game. I would give the game 4/5 stars.",

I found this game to be really fun, I loved the change of scenery with Ireland.  If you're already a fan of these games, I'd recommend adding this one to your queue. If not, it would be a fun game to introduce you to the rest!",
