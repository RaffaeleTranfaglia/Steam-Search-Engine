Sure there were lots of aspiring astronauts, lawyers, doctors, movie stars, and professional athletes. I wanted none of that. Since I grew up around farms, I had a deep admiration for goats. They were masters of their domains, and they didn't take nonsense from anyone. The goats were free to roam, climb, fornicate, and eat anything they could find. So it only made sense that I wanted to be a goat when I grew up.  My teacher and fellow students told me my dream was unrealistic and impossible. The Steam Gods have gifted me with Goat Simulator 2014 GOATY Edition. Now who's laughing?",

This game is creative, it has a good sense of humour to it, and damn enjoyable, but also requires skill and patience to master different objectives and techniques.

I highly reccomend that you purchase this game or prepurchase it if you are looking at this review before it is released on steam.  If someone was to tell you that this game was not good or it was bad/horrible and they have never seen this game before, here is what you should do:  1. Show them the gameplay trailer 2. If you have this game, let them play it for a bit  If neither of these 2 options work, you have these options  1. ♥♥♥♥♥-Slap them across the room 2. Kill their family and burn their home 3. Burn their current console that they are using to play Call of Duty on. 4. Sentence them to death via Woodchipper 5. Sentence them to death via Goat 6. Paint your room with their blood 7. Shrek  In conclusion this is truly a magnificent masterpiece in gaming and i can say it has completed my life. 'I regret nothing' - The Peacekeeper    ",

Strolling home late at night; i sit and wind down to goat simulator. 5 hours later im there running round as a penguin that is super buff one shotting cars all over the place. I then thought.

Yes, it is actually a bad game....but that doesnt stop it from being addictive, fun, and over the top funny at all. In fact, this is a game that you will ervisit over and over, trying new things, trying to get seemingly impossible achievements until finding success, and generally just wreaking havoc along the way. Who would have thought playing as a goat would be so much fun?  I've mostly stuck with Goat Town at this point, although I have run around Goat Town Bay a little bit. The Bay has a bit more glitchy imperfection at this point (I dare say, more than is intended), but I imagine the developers will continue to work on that particular area. Mostly though, when you encounter bugs in the Town, they are intended...or at least, they were intentionally left there to make the game even more quirky, lol.  It does have full controller support, which I appreciate.  Overall, I would give this game a 9 out of 10. You definitely need to play this game.",

Story: A gripping tale of love and betrayal, told from the perspective of a goat that must decide between his compassionate, love-driven upbringing and the dark, brooding forces that conspire to take him over. 10/10  Graphics: The goat has never been portrayed more accurately and in such an eye-pleasing way. The game transcends what was once thought possible about depicting these fine creatures in gaming. How many other games have you seen that feature goats so prominently? That's because it is far too complex a task for any normal developer. 10/10  Soundtrack: The score of this game never fails to give the audience 100% immersion into the goat's perspective. The music ranges from cheerful to borderline sinister. It really draws the audience into how the goat feels at all times. 10/10  Gameplay: You are a goat. You have at your disposal the tools necessary for destroying everything anyone has ever loved. Could you possibly ask for anything else? 10/10  Overall: Do you like an engaging story? Do you enjoy being truly immersed in a game by its versatile soundtrack and setting? Do you want to be a god-forsaken goat? This is the game for you.

From the developer Coffee Stain Studios comes the wonderful game Lag Simulator! This piece of brilliance is sure to make all of your goals in life to come to fruition.  Many people suffer from a lack of will or horrible procrastination and so cannot get themselves to do anything with their lives but to stay at home and game, hiding behind the safe veil of their screen.  And that is where Lag Simulator comes in to save the day!  This game will create such an immense lag on your pc or laptop that you can’t do anything at all but stare at your screen! Yes, that’s right: only staring at your screen! And that’s when you’re still at the menu! I’ve played this game for 75 minutes and all of that time was spent waiting for the game to actually start! How lag! Truly a wonderful piece of art!   Needless to say, I’ve never had more fun playing a game.   However, staring blankly at my unmoving screen gave me a certain feeling.. A feeling of productivity.   Odd, I know!   But during those 75 minutes of Lag Simulator I got inspired..   Scary, yes.   Inspired to do something. And since my screen wasn’t working (nor anything else since Lag Simulator lags the whole system!) I decided to do something with my life!  So passionately ( Yes, passion!  ) I began reading once again. I now know how to better massage people with oils and special techniques and all that. All of this thanks to Lag Simulator!  I, for one, recommend buying Lag Simulator if you really want to succeed in life!   For anyone not yet convinced to buy this superb game, take a look at what the developer said about it on their site:  “Lag Simulator is a small, broken and stupid game. It was made in a couple of weeks so don’t expect a game in the size and scope of GTA with goats. In fact, you’re better off not expecting anything at all actually. To be completely honest, it would be best if you’d spend your $10 on a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe a real-life goat.”   Apparently Lag Simulator has goats too. Who knew?",

Is life not constructed of the same matter as the rest of the universe? Does a dead body not have the same amount of atoms as a living body? Can you measure the soul? Is sentience, nay, is consciousness something a living being can truly attain? In the face of the infinite void of the universe, can a human claim to know anything at all? Can a human truly understand anything, or is all of our culture and history nothing more than the filthy residue of our species' unending drive to eat, ♥♥♥♥, and kill? Can any man claim to be superior to another man, to an ape, a goat, a snake, an ant? Should we as a species be proud of our dominance over the Earth? Have we, through our actions, proven to be noble and gracious caretakers of the only home we have? I think not. No, a man is nothing more than an unthinking beast with ersatz free will. Mankind is a nuclear wolf wearing the skin of God, barking at itself in the mirror in a locked room full of its own excrement. Barking louder and louder, bared fangs slobbering radioactive saliva, until it's idiotic madness causes it's own heart to detonate.  It is time to remove the mask of yourself. Rip away the insincere facade of humanity from your ego. Your leg is caught in the beartrap of society, and if you don't gnaw your leg off your spirit will starve to death. Become the beast you already know you should be, deep down inside, and the taste in your mouth won't be your own blood, it will be the taste of freedom. Play Goat Simulator.",

In the game you get to play as a goat and all you have to do is to wreck things and hurt people. Many people think that Goat Simulator is 'funny' or even 'stupid', but what they don't understand is the fact, that the game is criticism of our modern society in a sophisticated way: The people behind Coffee Stain Studios want to say that a goat simply could not fit into our society, it would just destroy everything without knowing what it does. You get the feeling that you cannot be a normal human being. You are being reminded by this depressing fact in every possible way:    - You see robots   - When you want to attend a family dinner, you cannot do anything but destroy it.   - When playing the popular video game 'Flappy Bird' you, and only you, are a goat in the game.  Other people in the city will not react to your cries for help, they will only run away from you. You are searching for attention but everyone will ignore you. Another sad fact is that you will encounter one scene in the game where people actually pay attention to you, but they just want to see you fight against other goats.   The atmosphere of the game is very depressing.  Seeing how the town is slowly being destroyed by protesters, that don't want '♥♥♥♥♥ shaped food' nearly made me shed a tear.  This criticism makes the game something speacial, I would even say it will get the 'GO(A)TY 2014' award.   Coffee Stain studios have done a really good job by implementing a workshop feature, that allows players to create other maps, goats and other things.   =&gt; I highly recommend this game because of its' unique experience. However it is quite expensive and not really worth 10€. 5€ would be more matching with the cost-benefit ratio.",

I am almost certain that lots if not all people who have played the next-gen games would like to be a goat. i may not have played much of the great Goat simulator but i assure you that it is well worth your money. I think that people are too harsh on reviewing this game because of the fact that you are a goat. But they underestimate goats as a whole. If you think about it, without goats we would not have Frostbite 3, Titanfall, Hand cream and who can forget the wheel. The Wright Goats flying for the first time led to this game having jetpack goats. we humans think so much of ourselves and too little of the goats. So i ask you, not as a Goat supporter but as a fellow steam user and in some cases a friend. Give the goats a chance... Thank you.",

Goat Simulator is one of those games you buy just to relax after a stressful day of work, or Dota, for example. I love this game because it help me chill out and prevents me from killing myself. It offers 2 Maps to explore, and with the expansion a third one is added. You have collectables scattered across them and lots of cool Easter Eggs as well. Many bugs in this game, but most of them are just funny, rather than gamebreaking.  The MMO expansion was added for FREE! (epic move) It will literally make you feel as if you're really playing it with other people... until you realize it is a simulation as well. Some skills and controls could've been made better as it's rather annoying to press 1 and E to take stuff but you can handle it. Collectibles and easter eggs in this one as well.  &gt;I'd give it a 9/10 &gt;Pros: Fun, sandbox, collectibles, cards, achievements, easter eggs and references, free expansion and updates(or so it is at the time I'm writing this), glitchy goodness &gt;Cons: Some bugs require you to restart the map(collecting money which goes through floor etc), might get annoying to have to look for the remainder of the rare collectibles, it's not for everyone, perhaps the price tag is a tad bit high.",

Goat Simulator is different. It's an April Fool's Joke (literally) taken to its logical conclusion - a ridiculous game that's all about fun, rather than frustration. You are a goat who runs around and does ridiculous goat things in a physics sandbox. That's all it is, and all it should be. It's also a great game for achievement hunters, sending you all over the levels to track down ridiculous secrets.  Of course the game style just won't click for a lot of people, and that's fine. But for those who it does work for, it's like nothing else.  Did I mention the game has goats in it? It also has fantastic emoticons.",

I've had a lot of fun playing Goat Sim, but in all honesty, I'm rather bothered by the bugginess. Some people think that the lack of fine polish and poor optimization adds to the game, but it really doesn't for me. Perhaps it's just because it's still being developed and patched, but it certainly didn't make for a super enjoyable experience for me. Either way, the net experience was definitely more positive -- the game is creative and fun, with all sorts of cultural references sprinkled in. It's my hope that, with time, this game will develop into a more polished version, and all the bugs and glitches will be worked out so the masses can enjoy it more.",

Try and kill people, blow up things, PAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRTYYYYYYYYYYYY, uhh ..... turn into a devil goat and destroy everything???? Mehh who cares. YOU NEED to play this game no matter what!!! More reasons... 1. Different maps 2. Different gamemodes 3. Can play multiplayer but only on same PC I think 4. Unlock cool goats and play as any goat combined! 5. Riding skateboards.. Best thing ever... 6. Achievements 7. OF COURSE THE AMUSEMENT PARK AND RIDING THE ROLLER COASTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   I rate this game 11/10 !!!!!!!!!!!!!

In fact, I don't know if I would even really call this a game, per se. It's more like a really fun distraction than a game. I heartily recommend this, BUT, please be fully aware of what you are getting. You are paying ten bucks for a fairly short, one stage distraction. While it is HELLA fun, it can grow old fairly quick. It's great when you have a couple minutes to kill, and want to have some fun, but can't commit yourself to getting into a game.   As it stands now you get maybe a solid two or three hours of gameplay, after which you are only playing for the fun of being an out of control goat in a suburban neighborhood, and wreaking total havoc. It does have Workshop support, so there are already new stages and stuff available, and hopefully the developer will continue to add new levels and stuff, but I'm not holding my breath.",

No one is there telling you that you cant do this or that you just set out with jet pack strapped on into the wide world and lick and headbut everything you come across.  I had a few hours of fun just seeing what I can do and what the limits are and the first tick against the game arose in the form of unseen walls . Certain areas you will go have them in head scratching areas with no indication that you will run into one and this can create some confusion as you could be flying through the air on your jet pack one moment then struggling to wrestle the camera so that you can see when it gets completely folded in upon itself because you hit an unseen wall and crumpled to its base in a garbled mess.  Head butting people and objects and watching them sail through the air is great fun and the easter eggs hidden throughout the game world are amazing and unexpected .  This game does not take itself or the world seriously and that is a great ... great ... thing.  The greatness of this game is that it allows you to do what you want with goals and secrets strewn about the landscape for you to find . The problem arises though in the form of the actual lack of hand holding to a fault .   While playing this game you will see missions in the upper right corner of the screen tasking you with one thing or another and its your civic duty to go about these tasks with aplomb . The problem though is that there is zero direction as to what one should do to complete these and although discovering them on my own was decent fun i found some of these missions deliberately vague and kind of cryptic . One such task was to sacrifice something for some reason . I looked everywhere for this and to this writing have still not discovered what it was talking about or refering to.  Graphical glitches and getting stuck on scenery do happen in places but with my hjet pack i was able to trick the game into releasing me from its grip relatively easily ... without a jet pack strapped to my back i had considerably more trouble doing so to the point of frustration ,  This game reminds me a bit of Katamari Damaci in its art direction and it is quite funny in parts having me chuckle audibly at times.  I would reccomend this game to anyone looking to just unwind after a long day and have some fun , I certainly feel as though I had my moneys worth there .  I do look forward to seeing how much further the developers take this game in the future.  8 out of 10 screaming goats",

            "review_text": "YOUR A GOAT LOL THIS GAME SAVED MY LYFE I WAS ABOUT TO JUMP OFF A CLIFF AND I SAW GOAT SIMLATOR SO I QUIT ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Serious review starts here  I'm going to attempt to actually give this game a serious review despite my 5 hour game time. I have to congratulate the guys who did this though, to start, I have no idea what they were smoking during all those meetings in the studio but it paid off, in a strange way.  Goat Simulator is just one of those games that really shouldn't have been made but was. You watched the viral video, you laughed, you waited until the game launched, you paid your $10 and laughed at it for 20 mins before quitting and leaving it to collect dust in your library. Like everything else that goes viral on YouTube. I mean, what happened to Rebecca Black? You probably don't even remember who she is.  Therefore, there would be no point for me to review Goat Simulator as a game, or a simulator for that matter, because it was never really intended for that purpose. If I were to somehow be able to shut off the laugh factor in my head, and give a Stephen Hawking review of the game, it would look like this:  Verdict: - Millions of bugs - Poorly made - No objective - Horrendous physics - Amateurish - Waste of money and time 0.5/10  HOWEVER, as this is a serious review of Goat Simulator as a piece of pointless junk, I'm going to overlook the (harsh) facts and change the name of the game to something more appropriate. #swagyoloGoat There.  Now, the main point of #swagyoloGoat is to be a really annoying #div to everyone in town. The map is very small, but the developers have released details of a new map to be added in May, along with multiplayer. God knows how the latter works. The game is alluringly moddable; you can also unlock Goat upgrades as you find little golden #swagyoloGoat statues around the town.   You get points for absoultely everything, from licking tables to being shot into outer space dressed as a demon, due to one of the game's million bugs kept in because they are all apparently hilarious. Of course, there is no objective, other than to unlock all the game's goats and trash the possessions of people, including their own spleen, around town. The sheer fun factor though is #insane. The amount of things you have never said before will mostly be said while playing #swagyoloGoat, believe me! You can do practically anything, and try jumping using trampolines and matresses to access almost anywhere. The funny thing is it is easy to jump to places you think it wouldn't be, which gives you a goaty confidence boost. There isn't much left to say about this 'game' other than enjoy all the random funny surprises it has to offer. Get it, it is an expensive laugh at £7, but it is also a damn good one. There is even an explicit content filter... So your children can play too... If you're that #wasted  Verdict: - Paragliding: 10/10 - Dragging people into Low Gravity Testing Facilities: 10/10 - Real resemblance to real-life Goatsteering: 1/10 - 'It's because goats do that!': 9/10 - I bought some goat's cheese today: 10/10 - Tightrope walking Ostriches: 1000/10 - I'm off to play #swagyoloGoat again: 0/10  Overall: okifffffffffrtimwuiheryhb fu rhtjeopmobirrmtpori rjuw pr g,uwr /10 Happy Goatsteering",

It always shocked me how my dad was as strong as he was, and i was scrawny, as well as my friends, while they acted like gods i was but a peasant. I felt like i was worthless. I lived the rest of my life like that... until April 1st, when i got a pie shoved into my groin and a paddle in my face, because April fools day, but when i got on my computer the news showed a new game; 'Goat Simulator' I decided to buy it because i thought it was a joke, but when i booted it up and smashed a car, it showed how powerful i was, and it reminded me of my childhood. And i was strong, like i always wanted to be, I was finally strong. This game will make you strong, i strongly recommend this game to anybody, because it is and always will be revolutionary.

Setting random people on fire, blowing up gas stations, partying on top of a building for no reason its all fun and no work. And now with goat MMO thats not a real MMO you get to shoot fire balls out of nothing! If you enjoy randomness at its finest then this is the game for you~  Pros:   Funny  Glitches  WEEEEEEEEEE! FIRE WORKS!!!!  Licking people  Large world  Randomness  No set goals  Look Mom!   Cons:   It will get old fast unless your playing with someone and even then it doesnt last that long.

His parents started to get worried, so they forced him to uninstall the game after 1.000 hours of playing. He first cried, but he moved on from his scars, but the memory of the Goat never left him. He went to college and studies for zooneurology and engineering which he succeeded in, made lots of money with and made him meet his first girlfriend. After 5 years, they get happily married and after another 5 years, they were a happy family with 2 kids and a dog. It all seemed fine and well until something terrible happened: his wife, kids and dog got in a car crash and none could survive it. the Boy became depressed and when he was about to pull the trigger, a computer fell down a building but survived the fall. It had a game playing on it, but what game? Goat Simulator. The Boy went to his lab and constructed a machine that could transfer his conciousness into a goat. He later stole a goat from somewhere and transferred his inner child and spirit into the goat, leaving a braindead human body and a goat that was running amok in the city, and he went to live happily ever after until an Animal Protection Agent had to put him down.

Very funny game, but has No story or dialog. Simillar to a certain Skateboarding game, where you get score for doing tricks and destroying stuff. Will be buggy, lots of clipping objects and getting stuck. Has Steam workshop with mods available. You also get the Goat MMO simulator DLC for Free which parody the fantasy MMORPGs.  Buy it for a good laugh and to goof off for a few hours, but make sure you get it on Sale. I recommend the Goty Bundle on Sale, which has a DLC Soundtrack and 4 DLC that add a new themepark to play on, that parody some other popular game themes and adds reasons to play Goat sim for a couple hours each.

There are fun things to look for and do in the two main levels along with the things to find are power ups for your goat but when you use the power ups they can end up ragdolling your goat sending you far up into the air and turning your goat into a monster that looks like something from Dead Spase or some sick twisted game's final boss. The two main levels are varry small and you can quickly get from on end to the other you can do that even faster if your flying from somthing and its a little disappointing of how small they are and because of that there is not a lot of things to do in one map if you dont include the mini games. I cant really review the dlc because Iv played varry little of it but from what Iv seen and played from it is its varry hard. Over all my review looks like a negitve one but the game is fun because its embracing its badness by turning the complete game into a joke by having silly and odd things going on in the two small levels and also by having really good and wonderful easter eggs. So in the end I'd give Goat Simulator 8/10 BUT I'd only recommend getting it if its on sale ^_^ thank you for reading if you made it this far!",

As a matter of fact, the game itself is a PARODY of stupidity, and here is why.  As if playing as a goat in a video game wasn't appalling enough, said goat is evil and chaotic, and has but one mission: to wreak havoc on the human world. With Mutators that give him abilities that spoof other games ('Goatborn', a spoof of the Dragonborn in Skyrim, allows you to Fus-Ro-Dah! your way through anything, and 'Blue Streak' transforms you into Sonic the Goathog), and an open world that's pretty much made of Lincoln Logs, the goat can do all sorts of crazy but enjoyable stunts. You can run on walls (no, I'm not making that up. There is goat parkour), do backflips through windows, detach all of your bones and ragdoll on various surfaces, and much more.  It has DLC. Yes, a game about an evil goat has DLC. Said DLC is a very tongue-in-cheek parody on other real-world influences - its first (I think it was its first, at least) parody was 'GoatZ', that turns it into a low-budget mockery of the mockery known as DayZ. The descriptions of the DLC just speak volumes; it's mandatory to just read through those for a good laugh.  Goat Simulator is worth a buy if it goes on sale, since it's some good, cheap fun you can enjoy without much delay, so it's something you can do if you've got to go to work or school within like 10 minutes, but you're all ready to go so there wouldn't be anything else for you to do.",

Both Cheney and Whittington called the incident an accident.  The incident was reported to the Corpus Christi Caller-Times on February 12, 2006, by ranch owner Katherine Armstrong. The Bush administration disclosed the shooting incident to the public the afternoon of February 12. Local authorities released a report on the shooting on February 16, 2006, and witness statements on February 22.  On February 14, 2006, Whittington suffered a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Cheney did not speak publicly about the incident until February 15 in an interview with Fox News. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor. Whittington later clarified that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances.",

Here's what you'll need: 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 1 cup sugar Pinch of salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 5 eggs 2 cups cake flour  2. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees.  3.  Grease a cake pan. Pound cakes are best baked in deep pans, such as loaf pans or bundt pans.  4. Cream the butter and sugar. Place the butter and sugar in a mixing bowl and beat them together until the mixture is light, fluffy and creamy.  5. Add the eggs and vanilla. Keep beating the mixture until the eggs are completely incorporated.  6. Stir in the cake flour. Keep the hand mixer on low or use a wooden spoon to stir the flour in a bit at a time until it's just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix it.  7. Pour the batter into the pan. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl.  8.  Bake the cake for an hour and 15 minutes. The cake is finished when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

A bigger map with tons of more stuff like: a Dam, a UFO, a Whale, a amusement park, a Helicopter, a obsitcle course, a hat shop(find money in-game to buy a hat) ,and a Deadmau5 party! Goat SImulator has huge Mod support but the only problem I have is that mods must be updated to the current version by the creators but you can have tons of fun with them. Goat Mutators are fun too which you can combind to extend gameplay. P.S. some muators must be unlocked.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

The shooting mechanics are perfect and the hit markers indicate whether you have hit a person or not. The aim assist is extremely helpful and helps you when you are doing extremely well in multiplayer games when playing against your friends or random opponents. The ranking system is fenominal and very rewarding, when your character has reached a maximum rank you can throw all of your hard earned work away and do it all again... 15 times!! it's brilliant!  The multiplayer also offers killstreaks a system rewarded to players for there good plays In fact, the killstreaks themselves are evidence that the game's balance is truly there. Killstreaks have been expanded from the original Goat Simulator, now allowing players to unlock rewards such as stealth bombers, AC-130 strikes, EMP blasts, and even a devastating 25 killstreak nuke that ends the game with a big bang, automatically handing your team the win if you can pull it off.  The gameplay is smoother than ever you'll instantly get a sense of just how far the improved engine has come from the previous games.Goat Simulator is definitely more chaotic this time around – partially due to the new visual effects and upped production values – and with the improved enemy AI and tough scenario design you'll be fighting for every checkpoint. One of the larger visual changes to the game's heads-up display this time around is the blood splatter system, you'd get damaged, the screen would start to shade red, and you'd be required to seek cover before your vision returned to normal.   For the vast majority of the experience, Goat Simulator is best enjoyed with friends either locally or via online. The core campaign may have taken a bit of a hit, but in its place is an incredibly well done debut mode called Spec Ops. For those that don't know, Spec Ops mode is an arcade-inspired challenge mode that can be played single player for the most part (minus a few co-op specific challenges), but is obviously designed around two-person team play. The mode is broken up into five tiers, each with missions that have a possible three stars to gain based on difficulty level in each of the 23 missions. You'll see a lot of repeating areas, some pulled directly from the single-player campaign, but the actual objectives (and most of the time, the exact layout of the level) is all new. You won't find leaderboards for this mode, unfortunately.  When you look at the total package, Goat Simulator is hands-down one of the best first-person shooters out there, and a truly amazing offering across any system.For the strictly single player crowd, however, Goat Simulator is surprisingly short, and doesn't live up to the standard set by previous Goat Simulator games.  My final Verdict for this game is - 10/10 - IGN - Outstanding",

I may not be one of those really judgemental gamers who pay close attention to every little detail, but that is what makes this game so enjoyable for me. I do like detail, especially in games like Prison Architect, though. Goat Simulator isn't one of those fancy run-of-the-mill games to excite everyone everywhere. It's fun, It really is. As you can see i've almost played 10 hours of it (Not all at once, of course, I am sane). I love this game, and recommend it for those who love games that are just random and...somehow awesome.

In fact i went 4 hours playing the game already before i realized i was playing it for 4 straight fun hours.  **NEW INFORMATION** After playing the MMO part of the game for the past few days i have come to the believe that the MMO part is NOT a MMO. Its great how they made it look like a MMO with npc's acting like players but it is NOT a actual MMO. Repeatly i have asked for help to do a quest and people ignore me in chat, i have said things in chat that people ignore BUT they all seem to be saying the same things over and over but as different names every time i log in. On top of it, when i do see these 'players' they all seem to follow similar paths and always be in the exact same spot. So even though it is great, lots of fun, it is NOT a actual MMO that has players you can interact with.",

            "review_text": "This game is pure silliness and a fantastic stress release; I was laughing for hours watching people run in terror as a goat blew up cars with nothing but its two horns, and seeing it fly like a doll as it was catapulted hundreds of feet through the air...only to get rigt back up as if nothing happened once its four hooves met the ground.  Is it worth the money though? Yes. Shooting things and cr ashing cars in a race is fun and can be 'relaxing' after a hard days work, but if you're like me and enjoy silly things (really silly things, borderline insane) then this game is the true cure for our itch. The way I look at it, I paid £2 per map and the spare change was for the overall 'game'. Considering many games charge £1.99 just for a key to unlock a crate you found, for one skin or item, makes this a bargain...especially since they charged nothing for the MMO update map or for the huge amount of skins and toys to play with.  +Just silly fun; you can blow things up and freely experiment with what you can do with the strange powers the goat has. +Although NPCs and the game will still call it a goat; you can play as an Ostritch, Penguin, Giraffe and even a Whale. +The dialogue from the NPCs matches the silliness of the game, making for some rather hilarious one-liners. +True freeroam; you don't have real quests or objectives tying you down, just a few little 'stunts' you can pull off for some completion satisfaction. = The music has a handful of tracks...literally. I counted approx 5 tracks in the game and they all sound silly and like something I would hear on shows like Ed, Edd and Eddy or Cow &amp; Chicken. I personally love them because it just adds to the loony feel of the game (not that it needed to). But if you do not like repetative music then you might want to consider muting it. = The powerups you obtain stack up on the same, single key instead of being assigned new ones. This can be annoying to some people, and hilarious to others (like me). Some powerups when stacked together yield laggy and explosive results, so you have been warned. -Whilst I enjoy the 'broken' elements to the game; a lot of people do not. Sometimes your goat will get lodged in a wall, fall through the floor in an explosion or shoot out beynd the games boundaries. Thankfully you have a 'respawn' option should this happen, and once you learn what causes the breakages it is very easy to play the game without them happening. -Sometimes the game will lag in certain places or events, and any items you spawn do not go away unless you restart it (this is usually responsible for the lag). -Like the Stanley Parable, I enjoy this game in short bursts of 10-20 minute sessions before it becomes repetative and boring. Thankfully though the experiences you do have when you start the game are so enjoyable it doesn't leave you feeling mind-numbingly bored when you turn it off, but just amused and content...you broke that virtual house and it felt good, now it's time to clean up your real one. Hated doing that? Pop on Goat Simulator again and smash another house up or blow up someones car; it loads a heck of a alot faster than GTA does for those quick 'freak out and blow stuff up' sessions!  Overall I give the game an 8/10. I really enjoy it for it's silliness and it helps me vent my issues in a comedic and very enjoyable game. It has it's bugs and flaws, but for the price and experience it was totally worth it. Goat Simulator; not for the literal or logical. But for those who just do not give a crap about anything but blowing stuff up and crashing peoples parties. RUN PEASANTS.",

Now, i have no problem with people who dislike a game because the Developers were misleading with the description, or in any other way. I do, however, have a problem with people that buy a game and demand their money back despite them having the ability to see EXACTLY what they're buying. I know you know where this is going, so I’ll just get right to it. Goat Simulator has received a lot of bad press due to people like i described earlier. I mean, you can't not know what this game is going to be, and if the description isn't enough, you can always look up gameplay on YouTube. So, to all of the people who dislike this game because you bought it and were disappointed with what you got, suck it the heck up. You had everything you needed to be able to know what you were getting, so don't blame the developers, blame yourself. Now, to the actual review. Goat Simulator is a joke, and a pretty good one at that. I knew this game was going to be hilarious as soon as i was scrolling through Steam and saw 'Goat Simulator'. I immediately stopped what i was doing and proceeded to see what the heck this amazing gem was. I looked through the preview and the reviews, and i fell in love. This game, if the developers put in enough time, could be one of the funniest games of all time. Yes, it's not what i would call 'Game of the Year', but i would call it 'Goat of the Year' (See what i did there?). Now, i'm going to be serious for a second, it can get boring, but then, any game can. For $10, it is way worth it. I've had many, many laughs with my friends whilst playing this game, and i plan to have many more. My recommendation is to only buy this game if you know that it's a joke game, and you shouldn't expect anything less. Happy Goating!",

This game is a relatively-open-world simulation game, in which you take on the role of a goat. Your goal is to cry havoc and let loose the dogs of war... so to speak. Most of the items and objects in the game are able to be interacted with, whether this involves licking them, headbutting them, kicking them, blowing them up, etc. The game gives you objectives to complete at your leisure, but you don't need to complete any of them to thoroughly enjoy this game.  If you have glanced at some other reviews for Goat Simulator, you may find that some people do not recommend this game for people who are serious about gaming. I completely agree. This is the kind of game for people who like to have fun, and do not want to take their games too seriously. You can easily spend several hours just running around breaking things, hitting people, blowing things up, and never really accomplish anything.   However, that being said, if you are looking for a game that is hilariously fun to play, and can give you hours of entertainment with no real difficulty or challenge, this is the game for you. Goat Simulator is light-hearted, fun, and a very enjoyable way to pass the time. I would give it five thumbs up... except goat's don't have thumbs... damn. Oh! Alright, I give it four hooves up!",

This game is great for achievement hunting, finding secrets hidden throughout the levels, having a laugh, etc. It even has split-screen multiplayer to cause even more chaos with your friends!  Once you find everything, the replayability is meh, but the devs may have another update for it by the time you finish what is here already, plus Steam workshop support for player-made levels, which somewhat lack in quality, but are really fun if you find good ones.

But then I began to watch a few videos.   Very quickly it became clear that the name of the game is satirical. Which just stacks onto the humor I found the more I watched. Goats dragging cars along by their tongues. Another being flung into a gas station and the large destructive explosion that followed while 'Michael Bay!' popped up onto the screen in large purple text. The humour and sheer simplicity of it was astounding.   I very quickly decided I had to own it and stop watching videos before too much of this unexpected gem was sullied. The amount of simply stupid fun the game has to offer is amazing. The developers themselves say they didnt put much time or effort into this shining example of mold breaking. But whether its true or not the game is rife with genius. Putting yourself in the place of a single, immortal and invulnerable goat as you run amuck, headbutting, kicking and bleating your way throughout the medium sized section of town carving deep destruction along the way is completely entertaining and more than worth the price.   From destroying whats around you, goring nearby humans to just exploring your surroundings the game is just fun. It is also surprisingly full of things to discover and secrets to be learned.   Some functions in the game are unexpectedly entertaining to add to the mixture of the already humour ridden experience. I spent a good hour typing away into the Talk function just to exchange banter with a friend of mine in the room in the easily comparable Stephen Hawking 'voice'.   Topping it all off with the fact that with its current full release, Steam Workshop is fully available and the modding community will undoubtedly create massive quantities of additional absurd and hilarious add-ons to make the game fun for a long time to come.    So to wrap this all up. If you enjoy the simpler things. Or possibly a frankensteins monster mash-up of Tony Hawk, A-Typical Action&amp;Adventure, and Rampage with the blood wiped away. This game is perfect.   You cannot go wrong.",

The 'gameplay' is entirely achievement based, challenging you to do ever more insane things with your god-like goat abilities to accomplish increasingly difficult goals and rack up massive amounts of points. In this respect the game is like a Tony Hawk skateboarding game with one map and instead of a guy on a skateboard, you're a goat.  Goat Simulator is just dumb fun and if you can get past the bugs and lack of content, then you'll probably be able to plumb a few hours of ridiculous fun out of this title.

I grazed day and night non stop. my whole family has left me because of my addiction to this game. My addiction to, well grazing. I play to feel the rush of pure excitement while feeling the texuture of the juicy, lush grass.  It has been 3 weeks now. I cant feel my fingers my eyes twitch from sleepless nights. But I must graze on. My mother has sent in paramedics becuase I havent ate since buying this game. They ask me why I find this game entertaining. BUT THEY DO NOT KNOW HOW IT FEELS TO PLAY THIS GAME! I passed out and am in the hospital. They say that I might die. But I feel perfectly healthy.   I cant take it. my head is throbbing and I cannot feel my arms or legs. They say I have a tumor from staring at the screen non stop. They say I must stay longer. Thats when I lost it I thrashed my arms flailing them everywhere. I ran far, far into the forest. Tired I fall asleep and wake the next day. I HAVE HORNS AND HOOVES. I understand now. To play as a goat you have to be a goat, so I find a group of goats to hang with for the rest of my life.

In the simple few minutes Ive come to play, I would rate the game 7/10  You may ask why so high, (Or maybe even so low) but from what Ive seen the game feels a bit broken, Its definatly playable and halariously fun nearly all the time, but the player is droped into a world as a goat with little to know knowledge as to how to play the game, I did However learn some of the basic machanics quite quickly through the loading screen, but I also had to go to the controls menu to learn how to use, or do certain things, there is no real goal to the game, or moral lessons learned, this is just one of those games you play to make yourself laugh when your having a bad day, there are plently of collectables and funny, cool easter eggs hidden around in Goat Simulator, in the days to come I will play more of the game to gain a deeper understanding of it, but if you are sitting on the edge about weather to buy the game or not....   I would reccomend googleing, or youtubing the game to find a video, or maybe even a better description of what the game is like to help sway your mind,",

I soon realized that the life of a goat is not so clean and even. After all, one can't expect a creature whose primary means of interacting with the world is headbutting to be so constantly composed. I found the surface details easy to ignore once I'd managed to reach the top of the tallest structure from which I could look down on all the known world. While the contents of an entire house swirled around me as I headbutted, kicked, and licked, I had forgotten those vulgarities completely. Then that flurry somehow flung me out of the house and into the clouds. At that moment, I was the goat and it was ecstasy.",

It's a game where the developers don't take themselves or their game very seriously, thus it's full of weird glitch which some people may dislike, but in most cases it will put a smile on your face. Almost every game you have places where you think 'If only I could *insert random action here* '. Goat simulator allows you to do whatever you wanted to. Wanna beat up the teenage mutant ninja turles? Sure. Wanna overcharge a rollercoaster? Why not. Wanna sacrifice humans to become Satan? Go ahead, the sacrificial circle is in the corner. WANT TO MAKE IT RAIN WHALES? YOU FREAKING CAN!   The game itself has 3 maps, being 2 cities and the map of the MMO simulator (It's not really an MMO, it simulates an MMO. You can play together though) while you can add any map you want from the workshop. The MMO simulator really has many many funny parts, better graphics than WoW (Really, the elven town is amazing) and even a fun little secret where you can bust the MMO's servers and reduce the world to Wireframe.  So all together this game has lots to offer in terms of sandbox and lame puns, and it will keep you satisfied for quite some time and the collectible hunters will keep on collecting in this amazing game.",

This game is simulation game, just as the title implies. There's really not much to 'play' in this game. There is the MMO update thing that added what seems like a World of Warcraft parody mode that you can enjoy with other players, but I generally find this game hard to focus on any kind of story or specific story-goals or anything given the outrageous nature of a game where you control a goat for entertainment.  The game isn't great, but that part of what makes it fun to play. There are bugs and issues, and they are intentionally left in the game, for better or worse.  There is a lot to do and a lot of controls to learn as you play, but there are a lot of fun little collectibles and events you can partake in (goat fight anyone?). The game is outrageous, it's funny, it's stupid, it's generally a waste of whatever money you spend on it.  That said, if it's on sale or something and you've got the money to spare to try it out, give it a go. It's not a complete waste of time if you're at least a little interested in the first place.  I recommend this game, but with caution that many people will find it stupid, pointless and wasteful. The rest of you will certainly have a good bit of fun for a while with it.",

This isn't about sitting around a farm, baaing, eating grass, and living a peaceful life except for those horrible people who come around to try and make you faint.   This is about living the life YOU want to live, oh and... Messing. stuff. up.   Maybe you've had enough of being a land dweller, so you strap on that jet pack and blast into the sky. The jet pack is just one out of several special powers.  I don't know what kind of goat research Coffee Stain Studios did, but I feel as if they truly learned what a goat wants (what a goat needs), like riding on a carnival ride...   Or, maybe you'd prefer to be the goat of goats and complete in this bloody goat vs. goat battle that reminds me of the fighting pits in Game of Thrones. (I didn't win.)  There are two cities, Goatville and Goat City Bay, and you also have Goat Simulator MMO which is like a MMO except you only deal with bots and not real people (which can be a plus). There is also brand new DLC, GoatZ, where you can be part of the zombie apocalypse. Go forth, and baa-sh in some zombie heads. (Jen and I don't have this yet, sadly.) Moving on!   Sometimes a goat's just gotta break up a party... Ride a bike... Blow stuff up, and so on.   With Goat Simulator MMO, you can pick your class, I quite like Magician, go on quests, and explore.  Really, you can spend hours exploring everywhere (Goatville, Goat City Bay, and the MMO world.) You can enter houses, too! I like headbutting my way through people's houses. (So baa-d.)  There's a load of achievements as well, so if love them like I do, you're definitely in luck. I have unlocked 8 out of 87. I have a lot of work to do!  I highly recommend giving Goat Simulator a try! It's worth the $9.99 (I mean, seriously.)  Goat Simulator is fun, funny, and addictive. I promise hours of enjoyment, and I hope you have an absolute baalast if you play.",

You no longer have to fantasize about being a goat, your dreams have finally come true! WASD to write history.   Gameplay-wise, Goat Simulator is all about causing as much destruction as you possibly can as a goat. It has been compared to an old-school skating game, except instead of being a skater, you're a goat, and instead of doing tricks, you wreck stuff. Destroy things with style, such as doing a backflip while headbutting a bucket through a window, and you'll earn even more points! Or you could just give Steam Workshop a spin and create your own goats, levels, missions, and more! When it comes to goats, not even the sky is the limit, as you can probably just bug through it and crash the game. Disclaimer Goat Simulator is a completely stupid game and, to be honest, you should probably spend your money on something else, such as a hula hoop, a pile of bricks, or maybe pool your money together with your friends and buy a real goat. Key Features You can be a goat  Get points for wrecking stuff - brag to your friends that you're the alpha goat  Steam Workshop support - make your own goats, levels, missions, game modes, and more!  MILLIONS OF BUGS! We're only eliminating the crash-bugs, everything else is hilarious and we're keeping it  In-game physics that bug out all the time  Seriously look at that goat's neck  You can be a goat Mac and Linux Disclaimer The Mac and Linux ports are still in Beta.

It would be nice if they could update the vanilla game with more content instead of passing it of as DLC. I think Goat Simulator has a lot of potential and could possibly become one of the most fun crash course/sandbox games on steam if it wasn't so lacking.

It's based on mmo's that are on the market today, like: World of Warcraft and Diablo 3 and even movies like Lord of the Rings. alot of the npc's are also named after them with little puns.

A lot of the fun comes from seeing something and getting an idea for some silly stunt ('Is it possible to backflip off of that building and lick the helicopter on my way down?') then trying to pull it off, or going through and trying to find every easter egg. And boy are there are lot of easter eggs.  I recommend you buy just Goat Sim and try it before adding Goat Z, since if you don't enjoy the regular game I doubt you'll like the add on very much, but if you liked the original definitely buy Goat Z too! It's worth the extra five bucks. It adds a huge map with just as much in it as if not more than the original map the game started out with and an entirely new game mode (Survival Mode), that's actually kind of challenging if anyone who was hoping for a game with more direction that run around and be silly.  You might get bored of it after a while, but just come back to it again after a while when you need something to do and it's just as fun as the first time.  Contains goats, aliens, zombies, elephants, MMORPGs, and Satanic rituals. 10/10",

There are lots of easter eggs and unlockables, although the gameplay is quite linear. You can't play for more than an hour or so without becoming bored, but it is a great time waster and stress reliever. The bugs aren't game-breaking, (although the game does crash on me once every five times I play.) There are various wall clips and bugged physics, but they are overseeable, because goat. The graphics are nearly 8th-gen standard, if you turn up the settings. Really though, the game relishes in its own bugginess, accepts it, and makes it ironic. And that contributes to its disgusting beauty.  *Edit* There's so much DLC now. I wouldn't cough up another 20 bucks or so for all of it. Like I said, this is a ten-dollar-quality game, and while that's not bad, it should stay that way. *Edit* Also, when I said 'various bugs', I meant holy crap was the physics engine coded by baboons  7/10 would goat again",

Now, let's get to the rating :   GOOD FOR :  - Graphics : entire city models and a huge village in MMO ;  - Easy to understand and awesome gameplay : for starters, you can learn how to play in less than a minute ;  - Listening community : making the game great again (and again, and again...) ;  - Gravity enhanced simulator : the game is realistic ;  - Small memory hunger : it's not a fatty ;  - Crazy stunts : 'you gotta lick it all !' ;  BAD FOR :  - A few crashes with less than 8 GB of RAM allowed on your computer ;  - ****ed up houses and demon communities.

Some of the silly ones were good, even Surgeon Simulator was good, because it was silly and funny, but it was also actually slightly difficult, and was actaully a game. This game is not really that difficult, but it does have some good and bad traits to it. You can play as an animal, which is awesome! There are a lot of hard achievements to get (as well as some very easy ones), and it's a stupid simulator game.  You can play as an animal in this game, which I love. It's so hard to find games in which you can play as an animal, and that is the reason I bought this game in the first place, and in the terms of playing as an animal it really fufills it's goal. Not only can you play as a goat, but you can also play as a dinosaur, a penguin, a giraffe and a whale. As whatever you play, you can make noises and act as an animal destroying things.  The achievements can be quite difficult or quite easy, the early achievements are obviously very easy, but as in any game, they get harder.Checking the achievement stats, you can see that a lot of people haven't gotten qutie a few easy achievements, which makes it clear the people who play this game don't play it for the achievements. The big problem with the achievements are that you cannot get all of them unless you buy the other DLC for this game, such as the 'GoatZ' one, or the 'Payday 2' one. When there was just one DLC it was fine, but now they have released a lot more stupid DLC that has made it harder and harder to get more of the achievements. Having all the achievements to collect makes it more and more fun to replay the game and try and get the achievements.  This is obviously a stupid simulator game, but you don't always need to play it as one. No matter what the game, you are always the one who chooses to play the game a certain way, no one is forcing you to play this game in a stupid way, and headbutt things, and go all ragdoll everywhere. You are playing the game like that, and there's nothing wrong with playing the game like that, as it is a sandbox game. But there's also nothing wrong with trying to get all the achievements, it's just another way to play. But despite all that, it is a stupid simulator game, and that also means it has a lot of spontanious references to mainstream things, like Minecraft, The Hitch Hikers Guide To The Galaxy, and deadmau5. These references are at first slightly funny, as it's a reference that you know and it's in a game. But at the same time it's about as funny as Saints Row 3 or 4, it's the type of funny that is splewn across the later Saints Rows games, it's not as funny as it would have been if it was a more serious game, but with the references still in there. Having a more serious game with small funny things works more than a funny game with funny things.  In the end, I can't recommend this game, as this game only draws in people who just want to experience something spontanious, and not by people who want achievements (because of the low stats) and most likely not by people who like playing animals in games (as there isn't as much of a demand for those games). If you want to play a simulator game for the silliness of the game, you could play Surgeon Simulator, as it is a much more fun game, a game with references and still a lot more difficult to play than Goat Simulator. Although this game can be quite fun to play multiplayer, so unless you want to paly an animal, collect achievements or play multiplayer, then you should not buy this game, as it gets old quickley.",

I was unfortunate enough to purchase this game before steam refunds were a thing, so I feel that writing it a not-so-positive review was the least I could do for this actual heap of garbage. Do NOT buy this game, not even when it's on sale, not even to make a funny joke. I wish that I could have back the time of my life that I spent playing this game so that I could kill myself knowing that such an abomination of humanity is allowed to exist and steal innocent childrens money. 0/10",

Better question, will this game last you a long time, or at least long enough to get maybe a decent amount of hours in before your sick of it? For I regretably found the creul truth of this game, it's just not enough fun. There isn't nearly enough fun, wacky things to do as a goat in this game to keep you occupied. Of course, just as I did, you'll have an hour or so when you'll say something like'BEST GAME EVER!', later you'll find out it's more of a in the moment feeling. I did have a good hour or so when it felt like it was so much fun, not knowing what to screw up as a goat next, but then very soon it was evident, the game got boring. (THE GAME LIVES OFF THE FACT OF YOU BEING A GOAT TOO MUCH!!!)  What do you do in the game?  The game consists of you, a goat, being well, a goat. You basically terrorize a small(and I mean SMALL) town and do what ever you really feel like whether it's ruin a family's dinner or grab a big boulder with your tounge and hurt stuff(kind of fun). Your main things you can do are move around with the W,A,S,D keys(duh), run with the shift key, use the E key to grab to stuff with your tounge and take it somewhere(maybe out for dinner?) and of course jump with the SPACE BAR. Also as you do more things in the game more small abilities unlock like the GOATBORN, which is basically you being able to Fus Ro Da as a goat, which I admit, can be fun.  Should I Buy This Game?  Really I don't know if I can tell you the answer completly, but I may be able to push a little towards my idea of the situation. This game is is fun for only how long you let it be fun. By that I mean it's fun only if you sort of have an imagination or like just messing around with no real incentives, or goals. Personally, when I play a game I feel I need some sort of goal to push towards and acheive because well that's sort of what makes a lot of games fun. Now there are a few small 'goals' you can do, but nothing really worth going into depth like doing a backflip, but earning nothing in return, horay. So if you want to spend 10$ on this game go ahead, just remember, the game in a nutshell dosen't have much substance to it so it won't last long if you don't like just messing around.  NOTE: Also just like to note that there isn't any multiplayer, but there is a workshop kind of thing where you can doownload other people's maps, which could grant a few more hours of play.   VERDICT: 7/10 It's Ok  Pro Your a goat Gives you a good laugh Only 10$(Could also be a con couldn't though?) Good if your bored one afternoon and have nothing to do   Con Causing destruction and such gets old after a while Graphics glitch out(I realize that it's suppose to be in the game, but can be annoying) No goals or at least anything really worth striving to do  Costs 10$  ",

Gameplay - 6/10 The gameplay revolves around exploiting the game's physics, bashing things and making them collide and clip through objects, and licking stuff, making things spaz out.  Story - 0/10 There is none.  Graphics - 5/10 Many textures are muddy, and while the lighting is not bad, this looks like a game from 2010.  Humour - 2/10 I just don't find it funny.

I enjoy mechanics, exploring, and occasionally story. So why did I get Goat Simulator? A friend told me of the MMO aspect of the game, which is a faux MMO of sorts or a parody of it. I loved the concept. And when I played it I thoroughly enjoyed it for 10-20 minutes. I then left it alone, uninstalled it, and then reinstalled it after awhile. I then played the MMO part again and the base game and found it temporarily enjoyable. I liked exploring a bit, but that joy ended quickly (not much to explore in the base game), and the MMO part lost the funny appeal part to me.  Basically, I got this game because I explored it fairly easily, the mechanics were...goat-like I guess? And obviously it has no serious story. I wasn't expecting any of that to a degree, but from the MMO aspect I was expecting more parody like elements that actually worked in some way without it just being similar absurd mechanics across the spectrum. My friend found something in it that I didn't see after playing it for awhile.  So let me put it this way, if you enjoy almost absolute absurdity, then this game is for you. I'm still glad I bought the game though.",

Some of the bugs are funny, yes, but there are so many bugs that the game runs very poorly. It can even go under 60 FPS, which is just terrible for a PC game.  2) The world size is ridiculously small. As an open-world physics sandbox, I am looking for something a lot larger with a lot more to do. With how small this world is, the game only provides about one hour of minimal entertainment, even with all of the modifiers you can give your goat.  3) Once again concerning how little entertainment the game gives, there's not much to actually DO. The game is very repetative. If you're looking for a game to spend hours playing, be ready to spend hours head-butting and licking the same things over and over again.  4) The game price is horrible. It's not worth $10 at all. The only reason I bought it is because I thought it looked funny, Youtubers made it look fun (Yes, this game is obvious Youtuber bait), my siblings wanted it as well, and it was on sale for $5. Even $5 for this game is a bit ridiculous because of how horrible it runs.  Please, don't make the same mistake that I did and waste your money on this game. It's not worth it, at all.  2/10",

The levels are very small, and you can run around each one in a minute or two. The only objective in the game is to destroy things and cause mayhem, getting points and combos which unlock new 'goats' and new goat powers which you can optionally turn on. These new goats and powers only add the slightest amount of variety, as the level you are in has all the same things to interact with that it already did. I imagine that you would need a very short attention span to enjoy this, because literally all you can do in the game is headbutt and flail around, its fun for about 10 minutes, and then if youre really bored you go around the level to find the numerous buggy and glitchy 'easter eggs', which are really the only content. These do not accomplish anything in adding to the game, its the old makeup on a pig.  To sum it up, its a joke that is probably funniest when you see a video of someone play it, the fun level only goes down from there, it feels like something I should not have paid for.",

You get two hours of enjoyment out of it pretty much. I guess if you are absolutely bored and have nothing to do, it can pass some time since it doesn't really have a goal and you won't get sucked into it like other games, but can occupy you.  Most of it's charm comes from it's references. Those are pretty much where all the humor comes from. Sure the physics may be silly, but it feels like there isn't enough to play around with to get enough laughs.  The map is actually surprisingly small. I initially thought it would have more to do. You see a city in the backbround, but unfortunately, you can't got to it. That would have been a fun enviroment to play in, but unfortunately, it's just not part of the one map. Also, the developers put in houses that you CAN'T enter. There are only two houses you can enter: The one you spawn in front of, and the Coffee Stain Studios one. I just find it kind of stupid how you have a small map, and make it a tiny bit smaller by having useless un-enterable buildings.  It's also sucks how the civilians are pretty much another object. In a game like GTA, it's fun to wreck havoc because there is a whole bunch of people and you can go on a blood thirsty rampage and watch the civilians flee. Then cops show up and try to kill you and you then have even more people and things to blow up. The civilians here are kind of few, and they just don't do much. They may make screams, but they don't really run away all that much.  It also seems like it is a hog when it comes to CPU power. Unfortunately, I can't really say much on this, since I don't have a super expensive gaming rig, but apparently some people say they have a good gaming rig and they don't get as much framerate as they normally do. But still, I feel that hardly matters, since it seems like it's still playable even on my laptop, albeit it's on low settings.  I do like how the developers capitalize on the fact that it endorses bugs. That is funny to see at first, but when you get down to it, it kind of ruins the gameplay a bit. If you see a funny stretchy body bug in something like Fallout or Halo or Gears of War, or most other games, it's funny too see because that is an unintended result, and things are funny to us when we don't expect it. But, when you get those spazzy body physics in this game, you know that's what the game intends and it just isn't that funny.  It feels like this game is not worth 10$. Maybe more like 5$. But still, who knows. This game does have workshop, so maybe enough people can make fun and amusing maps to play on or some fun functions and features, and that can save this game. But of course, that is assuming that the people who are devent at making maps and what not don't get bored of this game to the point where they don't want to work on it anymore. But still, it doesn't matter so much to the developers. They already made a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money from this. It was advertised well and a lot of people boarded the hype train. I was one of the passengers. Now I am in a place I don't want to be and can't get my money back.  TL;DR It's only worth half it's price, and it seems to be lacking in a lot of areas. Meh physics. It sold well because of good advertising and hype. Can provide two hours of fun, and can possibly pass a short amount of time every so often if you need something to do or waiting for something.",

I wish I could get my money back now, but I got it for cheap, so whatever.  The game doesn't have too much playability in my opinion. It's a novelty.

So for those like me that need more variety than basic mayhem and destruction with no plot (I didn't expect plot mind you) this is not the game for you unless they keep coming out with DLC that you're willing to pay for (which the DLC just looks, to me, to be the original game....except you're a diseased goat instead of just a goat.)",

Yeah, I paid that much for another game that wasn't that great, but at least it had good controls and some solid gameplay. That game, I didn't mind paying for. Don't buy this if you are looking for a game. Don't buy this if you're looking for goat simulator.
