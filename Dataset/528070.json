            "review_text": "I'm easily pleased by Solitaire games. This one is the worst I've ever played... (Wish me luck for finishing it. I don't think I'll have the guts.) - No story. At all. You would expect a basic story from a modern casual game with a theme. - Clicks don't always register. That's a big no-no in casual, again. If the basic Windows card games can do it, why can't a commercial game do it? Why do I have to click again and again to make sure a card is selected? - Everything is completely random. You can end up with 4 identical cards on top of each other, making the 'layout' unwinnable without power-ups. That's insulting, considering how easy it is to implement an 'always winnable' algorithm. - And finally-- the Undo power-up is broken. Whenever you undo a move, the previously removed cards aren't clickable again for some reason. In fact they're seen as if they were still removed internally, since if you attempt to remove them with a joker, it's the card behind them (!) that gets removed, whatever card it was.",
