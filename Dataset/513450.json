            "review_text": "Okay... credit where credit is due. For a hand-made work,  Drop Alive  is well done. But the main reason I don't recommend it is simply because of its difficulty.  Imagine standing on surfaces too long and dying. Imagine staying as a water drop or cloud for too long and (even when idling) shrinking until you die. Imagine acid pools, acid fountains, and flame spouts instantly murdering you. Of course, let's also imagine electricity and spikes that kill you instantly (sparks quickly shrinking you). Now imagine doing all this...without checkpoints.  I get that this game is hard and I respect their decision to keep it hard...but at the same time, it harms its enjoyability. The 100% token achievement makes it even harder. If challenge is what you wish, good luck. If you want an easy (or casual) 100%, you might want to look elsewhere.  4/10 A difficult experience that caused more anxiety than fun.",
