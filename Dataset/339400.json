            "review_text": "Gorgeous &amp; very addictive game with nice pixel graphics &amp; hefty sound-effects.  Objective: Delve into the dungeon as deeply as possible.  You have to act carefully and manage your recources to reach the deeper levels of the dungeon. There you find new gods to worship, better equipment, 'runes' and the opportunity to unlock new adventurers to travel even further during your next attempt. When you die (and you will die frequently, thereby loosing your precious equipment) you restart from level 1 again, possibly with a new character, worshipping a new god granting important boni. Fortunately you retain the skills you paid for during the whole game and the gold you earned with the previous character (I'm unsure about the tatoo's...). During your travel in the random levels you will find traps, treasure chests, special single-use equipment, shops with weapons and armor, teachers, rune-smiths, shrines, tatoo-artists and as a matter of course: many, many monsters and elite-monsters! All monsters are attached to their segment but have very nasty special abilities. Hence it's important to watch out for their interplay with the dungeon and the other opponents and to fight them in the correct order, killing ranged attackers first. Sometimes it's better to skip a fight - if possible - but in doing so, you loose the opportunity for important loot, that you might need later on. Some monsters even carry the key you need to get to the next level...  I especially like the feature that some dungeon levels have 'sub-levels' that can be unlocked for more monsters and loot. Remarkable are the non-combat random encounter's during the game with different outcomes, depending on your reactions/answers - often conected with your intelligence-score.  Great game, absolutely worth every eurocent! = 9/10",

            "review_text": "Truly a fun roguelike. And I consider it unique and certainly worth it's money.  However the gameplay is stiffling. It's not a true roguelike, as some elements carry over between runs, namely runes, gold and shop unlockables. Main problem are the runes, any rune collected and not used carries over to the next game, they are very powerful and rare. The key to success is to use the runes wisely. Additionally, many gamemodes (look up runewords) cost runes to play (most notably the endless runeword)  after your death, you can spend your gold in the shop to get passive upgrades to make the game slightly easier.  So what you end up doing is grinding. Grinding gold and runes in order to pay your expenses in a serious run, where you may want to play with a certain runeword, have prepared runes for certain gods you intend to worship and get tatoos from, and stock gold for certain items you hope to find in shops.  So when you do have a good run, you might not want to go all in in and spend your runes on the much neded tatoos in case you mess up and loose your entire investment.  What I want to recommend is a true roguelike, where every run is a chance to play it big, where you can play all in whitout having to grind for it on countless runs in advance. Things this game regrettably isn't.",

I had no expectations and was pleasantly surprised, a small title that's keeping me entertained for hours, it is strangely addicting where every time you die, you get gold and unlock a little more of the game, making yourself slightly more powerful. A bit random and unfair sometimes, but otherwise great.",

            "review_text": "It's a Minesweeper-esque styled, Dungeon crawler, Turn-based RPG Roguelike, and it works really, really well! You decend from level to level, starting with nothing more than basic equipment, clearing floors of various monsters, earning experience and items, which all, of course, get lost on death. You do keep the gold you earn, though, which is used to upgrade skills or buy items offered in your town. There are also shops scattered throught the dungeon floors, where you can buy, and sell loot you've acquired (hint: best to sell what you have, when you can, if you know you're going to die soon!). The lore is much deeper than I expected, as well as the strategy it takes to make it to the deeper levels. There is plenty to unlock, and keep you coming back.   While it's not at all similar to FTL, gameplay-wise (besides both being roguelikes), it very much reminds me of that game. It's in that same wheelhouse. The production level has a high amount of polish to it, in everything from the art/graphics to the sounds and music. I'd say that if you like games like FTL, or Risk of Rain, but are looking for something a little different, you should definitely check out Runestone Keeper.   ",

I can't unlock any more characters... can't get past the...7th floor at best, even with upgrades (that seem to help very little). The rouge-like elements suck, quite honestly. The carry over of gold on most plays is in the double digits. Takes forever to buy upgrades that way. Super frustrating. I think I'm done. I feel like I MUST be doing something wrong for it to be this messed up but I'm completely out of patience to reseach what's wrong.   TL:dr:   I got it in a bundle, otherwise, I'd be REAL mad. As is, I'm only a little mad. I think I'm mostly mad because I loved it intensely at first, but then I felt like I hit a solid wall at about the 4 hour mark. Now, no progress, no fun, I'm done.",

            "review_text": "A game that could be brilliant if only a couple of things were re-designed.   There's no winning strategy - on one hand you have to click each tile to have a chance of getting the items/upgrades that'll be needed to progress, but on the other hand you are severely punished for doing so by unavoidable spike traps, poison traps, etc - which would be fine if there were a stretegic counter but there is not! (other than the ocasional trap detection item you may stumble across... but only by means of clicking tiles and risking traps!)  Look, rng is fine but not when it makes the purpose of the game (clicking tiles, fighting monsters, finding loot) result in random punishments that are not avoidable.  90% of my deaths are ultimately due to traps, so there's definitely a problem here.  Redesign the traps - add an inbuilt trap detection so a player only uncovers the trap when she really *has* to progress beyond a tile (thus strategic decision; hp loss for sake of exploration) or honestly just get rid of them - the game would still be extremely difficult due to the strength and abilities of the monsters you encounter.  It's a vote down until the death by trap syndrome goes away, as the mechanic literally kills the game.",

Sometimes you step down into a dungeon grid and the game simply gives you a 0% chance to survive. It might be that there are a dozen poison traps waiting for you and you know that in three more actions you're dead, or it might be that the monster abilities work together to make them impossible to kill without some specific item, that you couldn't have known you needed and had a small chance of picking up in the first place.  ... why do I recommend this game again?
