            "review_text": "A very nice, highly tactical game with an unusual difficulty curve (not really a curve), some patches are exceptionally hard and require pin point timing and planning where as some scenarios you can simply run in and punch. I got into the series when I got a demo of the 1st game 'Desperado: Wanted Dead or Alive' free with a box a cereal (what a great promotion). I remember spending hours and hours silently knocking out every enemy in the one demo level and hiding their bodies in various outbuildings. This game still has the same great core game play with some less welcome mechanics bolted on such as the 1st person mode and movie export mode. This title improves upon the originals planning system in which you can set up satisfying combinations involving all your people silently taking down how a town. Some people may be put off by the large quantity of quick-saves and loading, but in this tittle I see it as slowly creating a masterpiece stroke by stroke. All in all I highly recommend this title or if you can get hold of it cheap, then 'Desperado: Wanted Dead or Alive'",
