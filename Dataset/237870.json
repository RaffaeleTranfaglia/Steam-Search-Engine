            "review_text": "Planet Explorers stands proud as having the most creative freedom of any fleshed sandbox/survival game I've ever seen. From mining the terrain to collect resources, to crafting, colony creation and NPC recruitment, to being able to build your structures, weapons, armor, helicopters, jets, motorcycles and tanks, and even your very own Kitchen sink how you wish.   PE utilizes a fully minable voxel world, along with a building and creation system that lets you bring your imagination to life.    *The voxel creation system.  You can build weapons, vehicles, and even armor through a voxel creation system that let's you shape, color, and even texturize. Not only create them, but use them ingame for their determined roles.   *Colony NPC recruitment.  While there are plenty of games out there that have colony management, It's noteworthy to mention that recruiment in PE is about finding randomly generated npcs (aswell as pre-made npcs if you're playing story mode), that you can recruit into your colony for different roles. You can have them farm, gather resources, upgrade equipment, or patrol your colony to protect it from assailants. You may equip them as you wish, and even recruit them as followers to acompany on your journey. They all have unique appearences along with names (The names list is a bit short at the moment though..). They also come with their own sets of skills that you can have them train other colonists to have aswell.   *Sandbox Creative Storymode.  This is a big one.. Pathea has created a sandbox creation game that includes a storymode, without any cut functionality from adventure mode. Not only have they done this, but they've also gone and made it multiplayer. You can either play this on a public server, or host a private game with friends only!   *NPC combat AI.  Monsters have been programmed to act according to what they are, rather than a default all-round AI slapped onto everything.. One creature will not engage the same as any other. Birds will keep distance, and swoop at their pray, or come in close temporary for a close range attack before swooping away.. Different bird creatures will even do this differently than others.. Not only do they have their own AI packages, but they also have their own animations specifically designed around them.   Humanoid NPC's, followers and colonists, utilize the different tools and weapons you give them based on situation. For example, you can give a follower a sword and shield, and they will engage into melee, until their hp gets low, in which they will withdraw a distance from the enemy. If you've given them a ranged weapon aswell, they will draw their bow or gun and continue firing at the enemy from a distance, while they heal. If they have an axe in their inventory, they will aid you in cutting down trees.   If you have an inkling for design, and would love to see your very own creations have a purpose and use in a sandbox world, Planet Explorers is a must!",

            "review_text": "My first review ever so bear with me.  To start of with the good things: - Huge world - A lot of customization - A ♥♥♥♥♥on of exploration - Enormous amounts of things to craft and build  Now for the 'less good things' - The music is absolutely terrible. It's so cringey that I almost wanted to refund the game right away before I even loaded up singleplayer. It really sounds like something Family Guy or South Park would make a complete episode about.  - The combat is awful to say the least, it feels really sluggy and most of the time you will be bashing your left mouse button because there is no option to hold it down and keep attacking. Also a lot (all?) of the enemies won't even flinch when you hit them with a 5 meter long sword, making combat feel more like a turn based system then action.  - The movement is buggy as hell and is very unresponsive, feels very unpolished.  - Dungeons, those pop up randomly on your map, and most of the time come in forms of a huge mountain with an entrance or some desolate factory which you can enter. Thing is, these things are so big and pop up randomly, making them vanish just as quick again if you just run slightly from it. Very immersion-breaking, they also make some weird noise when they show up which sounds like a seagull being strangled by a string of plastic. The dungeons itself feel mostly empty and get boring really (i mean really) quick. The mobs in it are way to strong for their level and take a lot of hits before they actually die. I wouldnt consider this a bad thing if the combat itself is actually good and responsive, but most of the time mobs just miracolousy dodge my attacks despite me standing half a meter from them.   - The map drawing and fps is low considered to other games of the same caliber, but this could be due to the slugginess the game itself already has.   Overall this feels like a game which hasn't been polished at all, also the fact the devs consider this game 'finished' makes me suspicious for the future for this game. I do not recommend this game for this price at the moment.",

            "review_text": "I finally finished the story mode. I want to say, great job to the devleopers on creating an egaging system that keeps nerds like me wanting to go 'just 5 more minutes'.  The game is well worth the time and money I spent on it.  My biggest issues at least for story mode -  - The player might need to be given more ISOs ingame to help offset the learning curve behind the creation tool. Theres a big learning curve and a major time sneak into your game as you try to figure things out.  - Colony set up. After hours of gameplay and such I would say this is the biggest issue (next to mining/lumber gathering) I have. I think I would rather see the NPCs auto-fill open roles in the colony based on what their skills are. Walls didn't seem to work nor did buildings. as the NPCs just sort of ran through them and I'm sure i kept getting rained on. Along with this is player inventory and colony inventory. I feel that the player should be able to fabrecate items from ether storage location. NPCs should build more things along with what they gather. Complete ISO items, wepaons, armor, defense weapons etc. I would also remove scripts from the store(s) if the player already has it learned.  - Missions. There are ton of them which is awesome. Some of them can be very . . . confusing on what to do. Probably need to introduce a more indepth mission/quest log with details of where things can be found (I'm thinking more along the line for the gathering misions). We have a monster wiki in-game, might need to expand that to include the different plants as well.  - Mining/Lumbering are pretty easy from the start through out. The Drill and Chainsaw IMO are worthless with the current development behind them. So we get stuck with a space game mining ore with a pickaxe and lumber with an axe. I think, the development team might need to look at taking all the gathering tools and merge them into a single item (like the Matter Manipulator in Starbound)... The current system to me seems half baked and not thought out. We have space traveling humans, I'm sure their ship wasn't crafted by men and women farming ore with pickaxes. Some of this I understand is because they don't want us terraforming the entire planet.  Overall, besides my nit picking on development choices. The game was fun and I will return to it often to spend more time... Need to perfect my colony building and location.",

            "review_text": "After playing it a bit more, I've decided to change my opinion a bit. I still recommend the title, but there are caveats. Lots of them.   The game has good parts and ... very awkward parts.  Good:     Voxel creation tool. It is absolutely amazing. Editor is well designed, and this how in-game object design should be done.   Awkward:  Oh, boy... there's a lot of those.    Enemies are bullet sponges. Not just a normal bullet sponges, but supreme bullet sponges. Every fight is equivalent to fighting M1 Abrams tank using bb gun. Except that driver of m1 is drunk or asleep and for some reason has hard time overrunning or hitting you. You plink everything to death, even with very tough weapons. Especially on foot. Judging by in-game comments (left by NPCs) they were turned into bullet sponges on purpose, to demonstrate 'how tough' the planet is.   Combat in general. All enemy movements is strange. Creatures have very hard time hitting you, and you have very hard time moving around with a ranged weapon.    For some reason it uses MMO game structures. Meaning you have a lot of fairly useless npcs with floating '!' and '?' over their head. Haven't seen this since playing HellGate: London.   Voice acting. The studio tried to introduce voice acting, BUT it is quite hammy at times. Some npcs are alright, but intro would work much better without voice.   Design vs Utility. There's something very strange going on with armor and weapon designs. Basically, due to amazing editor, you can design any gun. Except its stats will suck compared to in-game generic bullet rifle. Apparently in the past it was possible to make weapons with multiple barrels, or with barrel pointing in different direction, and then this ability was for some reason removed. Which is a pity. There's not much point in designing your own gun, unless you go after specific look. Armor design process has similar problem. You can make a breastplate out of diamond, and its defence rating will be very low.   Designing wearable armor is also awkward. Unlike vehicle/gun design tool, which works flawlessly, the armor design tool has trouble remembering to which body part it is supposed to be attached, and to which gender it is designed. So, if you design a 'belt' part of armor, and try to equip it, the game will stick it into your character's chest instead. Armor must be equipped in specific order, apparently. Also, designed armor doesn't even go into slot you specify. It is on separate page, and you're apparently supposed to manually adjust placcement of individual items. So, this functionality looks unfinished.   Audio issues. Audio that is being played in your spekaers is calculated relative to character's head. Even if you play using third person camera. meaning if your character looks at the camera and something explodes to character's right, you'll hear sound coming from left instead. Strange that this bug exists (it is easily fixable)   Bringing an item from creator into the world is awkward too. You see, in the game you find 'scripts', which allow you to make items with replicator (as long as you have resources). So one would assume that making something in editor would produce similar 'script'.. but NOPE. For some reason, this is done very differently - you're supposed to have parts of model in inventory, and instead of using a script, you need to go into model editor mode and 'export' the model.   Resource trees aren't properly automated. Let's say you need to create item X, that requires components A, B, C whiere A requires D, E F, B requires D, G, H and C requires D G F. You can't just click on final product and order the game to automatically create missing components for every level. Instead you need go through individual components and create them manually. Very annoying.   The whole colony management thing is, frankly, weird and feels out of place. Everything about it is very poorly explained, and making a colony turns the game into tower defense. Also, you can apparently bring 'story' npcs into your colony, even if they're givers for main story quests. I'm not sure if this even supposed to be possible.   I still think the game is decent, in the sense that roaming part of it is fun, and voxel creator is very cool. However there are a lot of weirdness and strange design choices going on, and the game feels very rough around edges. It looks a bit dated by now too.  So, it is worth checking out, but it definitely doesn't reach its full potential.",

            "review_text": "I waited over two years to write this review.   I wanted to write a good review back when this was early access. It was really good back then, for a time being. At some point one of the updates made the optimization terrible. I'm able to run the newest games coming out and wasn't able to play this game above 15 FPS. I remembered how fun it was though, and waited. Hoping they would eventually fix the issues. I kind of forgot about it for a while, till just this last week. I saw it had been released and thought I'd give it another shot.  I'm pleased to say it's better than it was, I mean it's finished so that's to be expected and all. I'd recommend this game to anyone really. There is enough here for people to play the way they want. It does the whole voxel thing, which some people don't like. It does it better than most games do however. If you were snake bitten by no man's sky or those 'spaceraria' type games. This one will scratch the itch. You're on only one planet, but you can tell from the screenshots alone that there is a lot to experience.   Almost everything is customizable, which a lot of people are going to like. I just want to give one warning about that. Play and beat the main story line first, then go crazy with the custom weapons and such. The reason I say this is because pretty early on you can make custom weapons and basically overpower yourself right from the get go. If you don't have a problem with that, and that's what you're looking for then... well that's now an option you know.   There is too much for me to point out, just know that this is an amazing game. I'm glad the developers kept working on it and didn't abandon it. It shows and more people should play this game.",

            "review_text": "I haven't play this game for over a year. Bought it just for multiplayer, which unfortunately is dead and boring. Most people I've seen are 12, 1-2 scatter on official and private servers.  I played for 20 hours on an official servers.  First I tried a Official story mode server (for about an hour). I found playing on this to be completely pointless. It still setup for single player. Meaning once a mission is completed, it's gone forever. Unfortunately learning new things are completely mission based. So all these type of servers are dependant on how many have come before you and how far they've gotten in the missions. Hence now no one plays anymore on these servers. Per the Dev in the forums, go play on a private server. &lt;-- I had a colorful thought to this remake.  Then I tried an official adeventure survival server (pvpve). The game still has lots of bug and glitches. You can't destroy player built structure, and there's lots of them, usually in cities where you need to go for missions in order to be able to advance. Players log on temporarly, build something stupid (grief) and log off. Imagine that, PVP with no raiding allowed. Second I was completely bored. There's nothing to really do except some missions. some are glitch and you'll never be able to complete them, some are just plain stupid, none are level biased.   Example. I just created my character (that has no exps or skills), run thru the mission script (that you can't abort), it spawns some monsters that kill me instantly in one hit. You have the option to revive yourself, but there's no point since they are still standing where they killed you. You respawn and die immediately again.  On the adventure server I found you get skills. To get a skill to go up, you must get experience points by mining, chopping trees, or fighting.   All drops are random. I spent 20 hours to only get the knowledge to make a stone pick (after 4 hours of game play) and a copper shovel (after 17 hrs of game play). I found out I can mine ore with a shovel. A stone pick will not mine ores. If you ask the right NPC, they will give you a mission for a MK2 laser rifle, after that you don't need anything else.  Shovels are obsoleted in this game. Best just use a pick, better reward and faster. Shovels only do a wider area, but less reward.  Ranged combat is everything in this game, you only use melee when you first start or if you absolutely have to.  They've added dungeons (adventure only). Risk vs reward just isn't there. Plus you find no scripts (to learn how to make new items) in dungeons. Just armor and weapons, mostly just junk to sell.  Fighting the various monster in the game is uninspiring. They run directly at you and get stuck on whatever obsticle is in the way. And then there's the part that hardly any spawn all. I remember a year ago, I was being chased alot. Not so anymore. Most just travel in packs. Kill half of them, the rest flee. In dungeons, the harder monsters are just too big and get stuck easily. Making it easy for you to kil lthem.   To make money to buy items you have to be able to sell. Most of the time, merchants are out of money, so you can't sell anything.   They've added a comfort level to characters in order to punish players that are too active. Now you must either buy a comfort shot or sit in a chair/bed and wait for your comfort level to rise. Yes, this type of innovation really make me want to play this game all the more. Watch tv while waiting for your comfort level to max out, so you can play for a while to do it all over again. And the better the armor, the less comfort maximun you have, so the more you have to eat and rest, but if you eat too much then you also get penalized. So I'm starving, b ut sincve all I had was low value food, I'm also penalized for it, makes sense. Yup, they've taken all the fun right out of game play.  Was reading this game is 'supposedly' schedule to leave EA on Nov 7 due to external pressure. Yeah, that's a very good reason to move a game out of EA, who cares if it's full of bugs, as long as we make everyone else happy, except the people who play it.  On the plus side you can make your own vehicles and weapons. It seems overly complicated to me as I don't play this game much. But if you're into spending hours on something like this, then this game is for you.  Got a disease, forget about getting a remedy for it, just teleport to a location to get rid of it. Kinda wondering why they even added them.  It can be fun for a while, new game nostalgia, after a while you'll start to lose interest, find out it's just repetative, and finally figure out it's just boring.  Disclaimer: I understand that it's still in EA, but so what, you sold it here, you get rated on what it currently is not what you think it will be.  Update: Tried the Single player game. No skill advancement in Story mode. This is what this game is truely designed for. However you'll get to a point in the story where you can't proceed anymore.  It's a recue mission, a ship trapped up really high between two cliffs. You have two options for the mission:  Option 1: Build an aircraft (to reach the survivors), unfortunately you can't do this since you can't build a factory yet to make the neccessay parts for the aircraft. Which leaves Option 2.......  Option 2: Build a ramp up to the stuck escape ship. Yeah right. I spent well over 3 hours trying to figure this out. While I'm sure the building part makes perfect sense to the devs, to the casual player it's a nighmare. Not only is building in this game difficult at best, you must build it in the right spot (where ever that is, I tried from multiple angles) and I was unable to rotate it, so you must struggle with that too. I even managed to build a ramp to the ship, however I guess it was in the wrong spot and so it didn't count. And trying to delete what you just accidently build doesn't always work either. So you must try over and over and over.   Eventually I just gave up on building the stupid ramp and on this game. Since this is a main mission, and you can't progress in the story until you complete it.  Guess I'll just wait another year again.........  Added note: Strange bug that clears out your tool bar randomly.",

Although, its not like actual partial controller support where u can use the controller for combat and use a mouse and keyboard for navigation through the menus and everything else. The controller support is absolute garbage. You can't customize many buttons with key binds, when you move forward you trigger some stupid auto run that can't be disabled, there are only like 3 buttons bound, and no you can't bind the rest of them in the settings.

Single player, optional multiplayer, pvp if you want or play co-op and start a community. Huge map of different biomes and Workshop, the people over at Pathea Games put heart and soul into this game and you really can't go wrong with this one.",

What I mean by sound problems is the lack of animal noises and enviromental sounds (which are out of place in certain areas). Its is a bit of a let down when the sounds and gameplay are pretty good at first release, but then after numerous updates the gameplay and sounds have turned out worse in the final release.  Like I said I have been on the forums to the devs about these issues and its always 'It will be fixed in the next patch'. Which never ever happens. Final release....oops still bugs, bugs, bugs. Also as another post had said the graphics are hazed over to fix any graphical glitches.",

The game as of right now is unplayable because of a very annoying and consistant glitch where shift brings up the mouse pointer but shift also sprints and since you're sprinting with your mouse pointer up you can't turn unless you hold your right click down and move your mose in the direction you want to move, insanely annoying. But E also brings up the mouse pointer for some weird reason and so does F1, in fact so many buttons bring up the mouse pointer that it just becomes unplayable.   I'd wait a couple months to see where this game is at before even entertaining the idea of buying it.  2 cents",

Walk another 5 minutes to get doctor 3. Walk 5 minutes with doctor to friend 4. Walk 5 minutes with friend and doctor to camp 5. Get eaten by alien rodents because you try to kill them with an axe, and that is not a weapon, obviously.   For the money they still want for this game, this is basicaly a scam.",

There have been some bumps along the way (chaning engine) but in the end I feel it worked out for the better. The game now looks great and with most all the promised features in really feels like a great adventure/survival game. Along with multiple modes, crafing, huge open world this game gets continually updated by a great group of devs that know what their goals are but consistently listen to their player base. At 25$ this game is definitely worth checking out, if not grab it on sale!",
