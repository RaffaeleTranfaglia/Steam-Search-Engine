Beyond the protective walls of Illumina Castle lie miles of pastoral, rolling countryside, though once a serene landscape, the Aklorian forces have transformed the countryside...",

The value for the price is great even without a sale, and with a sale it should be in the library of every RPG fan.  +Graphics good for the time, and hold up decently +Fully voiced dialogue for all conversations +Unique characters with different traits and talents, customize as you level +Decent story depth and length (15-20hrs likely depending on style) +Unique and fun combination of first-person and third-person real time combat +Switch seamlessly among party members in and out of combat +Equipping different weapons/armor will change character model appearance +Controls customizable and work well, keyboard/mouse or game controller +Plenty of exploration, side quests, and treasures for those interested  -Voice acting is mediocre, sound/music is nothing memorable -Camera can be annoying at times -Map system is not great, easy to get turned around in dungeons -Only 4 playable characters -Armor changes occur with the story so if you prefer one look there is no going back",

            "review_text": "sudeki is an obscure RPG that got its start on the original Xbox. The game was largely ignored but it shouldn't have been. The game takes about 20-30 hours and can best be described as a slightly mroe open Fable. The characters are interesting if a bit cliched. The graphics are surprisingly good for the time period also. The audio is standard fare with a few standout tracks (New Brightwater). Overall it's a fun game with some unique ideas such as the two ranged chaacters using first-person mode in combat maknig them paly like they're in an FPS. (a tip: If you're using a controller, when using these characters, use a mouse to aim as it's MUCH faster).   Overall an enjoyable title and well worth it at the price point.",

I am running windows 7  here is how to get the game running on your PC for people running Windows XP, vista, 7 or newer OS systems, provided you were experiencing the same compatibility issues i was. (I hope steam will post this in the game descriptions also)  1. Buy and install the game from steam ( i highly reccomend this game i had it for xbox it was awsome)  2. after you install the game go to your folder directories or whatever folder where you install your games, my folder for my games for example is...Computer--Local Disk (C:)--Program Files (x86)--New Folder--SteamApps--common--  3. Find your folder file that is titled Sudeki and locate your Sudeki.exe file  4. Then you right click on it with your mouse and click Properties  5. Next click on your compatibilty tab and check mark the box to run inWindows98/WindowsME mode. Then click apply.   6. Now go back in your Sudeki program files and locate your SudekiLauncher.exe file follow the same procedure as listed in steps 4 and 5.  7.Once done with that go back into your Sudeki program files and locate the folder _CommonRedist, click on the folder that says DirectX, then click onthe folder that says June2010 and locate your DXSETUP application file. Now when you locate that file follow the same steps as mentioned in steps 4 and 5.  8. Next goback into your _CommonRedist folder and locate the folder vcredist click on that folder, then click on the folder 2010, then locate your vcredist_x64 application and follow the same steps as listed in steps 4 and 5.  9.After that locate your vcredist_x86 application and follow the steps listed insteps 4 and 5.  10.

If you did your steps right as mentioned your game will run smoothly  I am going to immensly enjoy this game I hope you do to.  I can recommend this game without even playing it. i had this game on xbox. one of the more decent rpg games for the original xbox. i loved the game. the graphics were great and the plot is well written. It is a great game plenty of action plenty of exploration. i logged some serious hours when i had it on xbox. i am super excited i bought it for PC. However, for serious and not so serious RPG gamers this game is a must buy.",

            "review_text": "*sigh* alright. So this is my 3rd review. The first one was positive, then negative due to several crashes NOW .. here I am yet again. I am not sure if setting Audio Quality to medium helped any. But the truth is I do love this game. I just really hope all the crashes will stop.   When I first saw that Steam had Sudeki I bought it instantly. I've last played it way back when I was a kid and always have loved it and still do. It's bright, colorful, silly and fun.  To me it's very nostalgic on top of all that.  Now, all that being said, $5 is really not a lot. So I'll stick with a positive review.  The game is loads of fun. I mean it. I am hoping for another update that might help stop the crashes altogether, or at least ... minimize them even more. I also still cannot tilt the camera up or down. But all in all ... I am glad I have this little gem back.",

            "review_text": "This is a decent Action RPG. I'd recommend it for anyone out there looking for a simple ARPG if you're not afraid of a few ugly 3D models. It's not my place to criticize the character design but they're a bit over-the-top and heavily influenced by anime, not that it matters but this game is not japanese.  This game was one of the handful of RPGs that Microsoft made with interest of slipping the Xbox console into the Japanese market. While the game was not a commercial success, what we ended up having was easily a fantastic RPG on Xbox and even though it's been out for PC for quite a while, it's such an obscure game that nobody really noticed it much and now we have it on Steam and I couldn't be happier.  The story, as well as the characters are somewhat forgetable, but it's got amazing scenery, the style of the world is similar to Fable and Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning. Very colorful, full of fantastic devices and monuments and very green with lots of vegetation too. The gameplay is the most important element in this game: it's fluid and it gives you a few choices, you can play an action hack-and-slash type of character or a First Person Shooter type. You get 4 characters to play with, all play together in the battlefield but you take control of one while AI takes over the others. 2 of them use Melee (Hack-and-Slash) and the other 2 use long range attacks (FPS).  Each of them has different skills and combos and you can enter a slow-motion mode when you go through the skills and pick one to use, so the game never truly feels like it comes to a halt. This makes things stay interesting for a while.  I could go on and on about who's who and what each character does but honestly, it's not that important, just know they're all very different in their style even if their gameplay is similar. Combos are different, they use different weapons, skills are definitely very very different so you'll have favorites. Also, all their one-liners are SUPER CHEESY so you can't escape those either way.  The voice acting is not very good, you can see it's not a big budget game but these fantasy RPG type of games are TEXT-HEAVY so the voice acting is basically cutscenes and one-liners.  On the technical aspect of the port: I am playing with an official Xbox 360 Gamepad and it's playing really GOOD, no complaints on the controller scheme, it's basically the same as back on the Xbox (although it's been almost 8 years so...don't quote me on that). The only problem I see is how the game text uses 'Button1' and 'Button2' instead of labeling it 'X' and 'A', but that's not a big deal. I'm not on the high-end of PC gaming but I can run this game fine and so far I've seen no issues with widescreen or sudden crashes (from a bit of play-testing) and the frames per second seem fine too, I do see some issues with vertical sync but it doesn't take away from the experience. I do wish there were some mods for this though, some 2D art and 3D models are ugly (my opinion) and I'd love to change them.  Although it is not some sort of hidden underrated gem, it's definitely a good game that didn't get enough attention and I'm sure most sales for this will be nostalgia-induced, and that's not necesarily a bad thing. It's based on something real good, enough to stay in your mind and make you want to play it again.",

            "review_text": "VERY impressed with this re-port. Sudeki was originally released on PC as a port shortly after the original Xbox game was released (so don't expect amazing graphics or anything like that, whilst it does still look good) - but had a myriad of issues. It wouldn't run on newer operating systems, didn't have proper controller support (the 360 controller didn't exist then so I can forgive them that) and had horrible mouse support.  This updated version (it IS updated) fixes all of those issues and SIGNIFICANTLY boosts performance. On the non-steam older version I get around 25-30fps. Now, same PC (i3 380m 2.53GHz x2 HT, integrated, 6GB) I get around 30-50fps. Very impressed. Also button prompts have been updated to show 360 controls.   Whoever updated this, you've done yourself proud.",

As for the Krenn fight: Shoot at him until he comes up on you, then use a special attack so his attack will go right through you. Then when he goes back to the center, keep your eye on him, when he stops and turns to face you, go towards him off to the side a bit and past him. He will not be able to hit you as his blast is aimed away from you.",

This game has aged like mammas breast milk but, still drinkable! it's a fun game that has four different playable characters that you can swap on the fly. The plot isn't even as deep as a ♥♥♥♥♥s throat chamber but gets the job done. Four heros brought together to save the world, real ground breaking stuff I'm sure. There are two kinds of battle systems here, Melee combat thats a bit clunky. Kinda like you first car, but it's servicable. and the FPS combat that inspired Call of Dutys control scheme. Anyways each character has thier specail ability that you can use to help you on your way through Sudeki. Tal can push ♥♥♥♥, Ailish can use magic but can not dress herself,Elco can fly using yellow kryptonite ,and Buki can Stirpe and climb on walls of moss (Very Exotic). If you have the RPG erection, for 5.99 this will satsify you for at least 15-20 hours!",

It is a game that had incredible potential, that was wasted on simplistic puzzles, shallow story and pidgeon holed game play in which certain characters were not available during certain sections of the story. In some cases, that made sense, but in other cases, like the final boss - (in which you think you'd have access to whatever character you wanted to play, you were limited to one), it was distressing.  It's a game that idea-wise was great, but in execution left me cursing at the stupidity of the story at times.   Don't get me wrong, it does have it good points. And it was fun for as long as I did play it, but at some points there was simply confusion as to what to do next, how to progress the story, etc...  I just wish that more time were devoted to the concept and an engrossing story, because it did have potential to be a great game, but missed the mark in my opinion.",
