            "review_text": "Secrets Of Rætikon is a beautifully rendered game, it's all very colorful. It's hard to explain it gameplay wise. But you're a bird and you have to find artifacts that are scattered all over the world. You might say that it's a Metroidvania game but it's not. You won't gain any skills or abilities and all places are freely accessible. The goal is mainly to survive, while finding these artifacts. There are several types of 'enemies' and not all of them will attack you on the spot. Some of them will try to grab you or your artifact and others will just leave you alone because they're lower on the food chain. You can go faster by flapping your wings and you can even dive to increase your speed. The controls are unusual but work very good.  There's no map system in the game so you have to find everything by scouting the areas carefully. This can be hard, but fortunately the game is only a few hours (3-4) long so the world isn't  that  big.  I really enjoyed playing the game, but one thing that bothered me was the fact that you can't continue the game once you finish it. So make sure you do everything before dropping that last artifact, unless you want to play through it again, of course.  There's always room for improvement and Secrets Of Rætikon is no different. But despite its shortcomings I had a great time playing in this magical and very stylish world.  [Rating: 84/100]",

            "review_text": "To be honest, i'm pretty much neutral about this game. I like it, great astetics and concept, but I feel like the one thing that really makes it a rotten egg is the protagonist. They're too underpowered, and you haft to do some things over and over again if you even want to do it. All you can lift into the air is the animals, and they never like you. On top of that, the special-looking blue triangles are pretty much useless. It's only a rez @ the spot you died, when you can just fly back to where you were. Pretty animation, though. As I said earlier, none of the animals like you, pretty much everyone wants to bar your way except for the little red and yellow birds. You can't even fight back most of the time, unless you throw them into thorns. Being able to hatch birds dosen't help at all; the buzzards still attack you and the magpies still take your stuff.  In conclusion, I feel that for most people, this game will eventually send them into a rampage and they'd quit, saying it's too hard. Add some allies or strengthen the protagonist and it might make a decent game, but until then, it's not worth the 10 bucks, unless you like looking at the pretty stuff.",

            "review_text": " *note: this review was made within a few days of the game being released for early access. Some things will definitely be different in the future.*   Firstly, this is unlike any early access game I've played. It's actually playable!  The basic premise behind this game is the following: you're a bird. You're looking for singing rocks that, when you do find one, everything (read: EVERYTHING) wants to mess you up. That is, as far as I can tell, the point of the game. But the funny thing is, this unexplained goal is something I  want  to achieve when playing. Everything about this game makes me want to play, even when I don't know why. The very well done flying mechanics feel intuitive and, even on the keyboard, I found myself soaring around relatively quickly.  The entire atmosphere and art style feel like a children's book mixed with cave paintings mixed with origami. If that doesn't sound awesome, then stop reading right now. The music (note: I am a composer, so my music opinion is much more in depth) is a happier sounding minimalism. Basically expect lots of repetition, constant looping ostinatos and continuous percussion that tend to stick out of the mix. Initially, I was put off by the music to be honest. Minimalism isn't really my thing and hearing the same 4 second melody over and over and over? Well, I was beginning to consider switching off the sound after a while... But it gradually grew on me, especially when I got further into the world. It starts to really come into its own when you meet the more interesting animals. So, I'm passing the music, but would much prefer something more than what's currently available. Speaking of audio, I did notice repetitive sound effects, so I'm hoping the creators decide to invest in more than the handful of rock cracking sounds they have! I also dislike the wind sound that accompanies a dash. That would work a lot better as a speed activation, rather than a button activated sound effect.  So, the  tl:dr  version:   PROS:  Beautiful artstyle Wonderful atmosphere Very polished controls and engine World is intriguing   CONS:  Music can get repetitive and dull over time. Did grow on me though. Sound effects are obviously few and far between/need to be changed in places  Now, the big question is:  is it worth it?  I would definitely say yes. There's a decent amount to go with already, and it's still early access. If the creators keep it updated and improve upon it, then the answer will be: OH GOD YES!  Looking forward to the future of Rætikon.",

            "review_text": "Obviously it's very pretty. A sort of 2.5D collect-a-thon platformer, without the jumping puzzles. Far from perfect, but would still recommend. The controls are very simple, but very ropey and imprecise. The narrative is non-existant. Quite why you're doing anything, or what exactly it is you've got to do at times is unclear. The game is action-focused, in that you're constantly doing everything you can to avoid action. Three hours long but ends very abruptly. A map is sorely needed.  In short, everything is kind of okay, but can lead to intense frustration. I would not recommend it as a method to relax. Only buy if you're already a relaxed person, because the controls and enemies will likely annoy you.  7/10, would recommend, but probably won't play again",

Thankfully the gameplay seems pretty great so far, I haven't played much. Metroidvania style games are always great in my book so maybe I'm biased, but the freedom in this game feels great. Flying high and diving down through the wind is addicting all on it's own.  The only thing with the controls is that sometimes it'll feel a little clunky, mostly when flying through the trees, but by design they're made to slow you down, so if you're in a hurry, don't fly through trees.  All in all, if you like great artistic visuals and Metroidvania style gameplay with lots of puzzles, get this game.",

The game seems like it wants you to have fun exploring and reading tidbits of lore, but then it has irritating enemies and traps that add nothing to the game except drain the fun out of it. Flying in circles trying to time dives and flaps perfectly to grab useless doodads isn't fun either. This dev team should have signed up to make the art for someone else's better game instead.",

You can fly, as one would expect so that adds some nice bits to the gameplay as your movment is not limited by height though there is a limit to how high you may fly before being sent back down to earth. You spend most of your time flying around exploring the game and it has a fun art style, while the music is not memorable it stays at a nice slow pace and never offends. Challenge is low but you can die from birds of prey, the rather nimble lynx and various harzards like water and brambles. The fun of the game is exploring the world so if you like that this is a good game for you, the ending makes no sense but maybe I just didnt read enough the game's lore which is done with runes that you collect so you can read the writting on stones scatterd through out the game. Gameplay is ok you can pick up stuff and thorw it around so that adds some fun pyschics based action, and if you get a secret you can become god bird destroyer of life. Overall game was fun,I would buy it at $5.00 if it goes on sale again.",

That's all the praise it's getting from me:  it has a defined aesthetic (that many find apealing but was more uncomfortable for me). It has the elements of gameplay needed to show proof of concept It shows that that it has character interactions and physics It has a full set of sounds including background sound effects  None of this makes it a complete or enjoyable experience. The gameplay is tedious and artificaly elongated with travel time (which you have to be active for and so conscious of every damn flap of your birdmans wings).   The puzzles are not at all puzzles, simply fetch quests that some times require you to put together simple jigsaw pieces in the same damned pattern every time. There is no meaningful narrative or plot to the world your in.   The so called eco-system is a sham, all it is the choice to spawn creatures in the world or not to, the creatures interact with each other in the most basic of fashions which is simply to kill or be killed. And seeing as your on the menu you might as well not bother.  The worst part is the end. I'm not a completionist, but I need closure, so after my hour or so of repetitive tasks I went and got my closure by looking up the ending. It is the most artificaly 'Artsie', up its own ♥♥♥♥ ending I have seen in a long time, so much so that I was glad that I had only wasted one hour on playing this 'artistic statement'.  This is someones bloated university project that has no direction, no goal, no meaningful content, its just flashy and serves to illustrate that they can make all the technical systems that went into its construction.  Congratulations, now you can use this to show investors and put your obvious creative talent to good use making an actual game.",

        {
            "review_text": "I thought that name would have some deeper meaning behind it and it somewhat does. It's based on the Roman province of Raetia, which used to be located right where I live and in fact the name is still widely used and synonymous with our people. And the game is in fact set in the alps, so there's little confusion as to what is meant. However I'm not sure what the secret that lies here should be because as far as I can tell there isn't one.  I'd like to say that Secrets Of Raetikon is basically a cousin to FEZ, a highly stylized game with beautiful scenery and a gorgeous aesthetic built around collecting small pieces to either advance to the next area or form larger pieces that you need to collect as well to make the ending happen. But the reason I say it's only a cousin and not brother to FEZ is because it's nowhere near as good as FEZ. It's not a bad game per se, all the elements are there and work perfectly fine but what made FEZ interesting to me was the immense creativity put into building this world that seemed so utterly, soul-crushingly lonely in spite of the fact that the whole game looks absolutely awe-inspiring.   Secrets Of Raetikon tries to do similar things with the what I title 'alien alphabet', though in this case they're just variations on runes, but it just seems like less effort went into building this world as opposed to FEZ. The game lets you collect runes throughout the game in order to decrypt a variety of messages in the game but A) I never needed to collect the runes because I for one can actually read a couple of variants of Futhark (runic alphabet) and even if you can't, most letters are made similar enough to the modern Latin alphabet that you shouldn't have much trouble deciphering the messages (I had all the letters of the first message decrypted instantly and only needed to wait for other messages to see how the other runes looked to deduce what they stood for) and B) the messages are entirely pointless. They try to paint this ethereal picture of what is happening in the game but unfortunately, there's no story or plot to be found in this game. Again if I may return to FEZ, yes if you just play the game, collect all the cubes and get to the end, you're none the wiser, but that game is chock full of clues as to what this world is about, even though the first messages of that game delivered by the golden cube were a silly joke form Phil Fish, but you had to actually decrypt an entire alien language with no hints given, as well as a numeric system that isn't easily translatable to arabic numbers. Not to mention all the other secrets and absolutely insane puzzles that game features. Secrets Of Raetikon by comparison basically has one puzzle you have to solve about 4 times in the whole game, which is collecting pieces of broken statues and putting them back together in order to unlock something.   And it just occurred to me that I haven't even talked about the gameplay yet. You play as a bird and fly around the levels and explore every last corner of the map because there are a variety of hidden sections masked as rock where you can actually fly through, so yeah, the secrets in this game are basically just hidden in plain sight with no thought required. However unlike FEZ, this game actually has other creatures, meaning different animals and not all of them are friendly. To defend yourself from them, you can pick up basically anything, including enemies, so you have ways of dispatching them by picking them up and throwing them into spikes or picking up thorny plants and smacking enemies with them. It's not that easy and it can get annoying at times because whenever you pick up one of the shards you need to bring back to the machine at the hub, all of the animals suddenly go berserk and want to take the shard away from you.  Another problem is the fact that this game makes you backtrack an enormous amount because the machine isn't located at the center of the world so every time you unlock a new area you can't go there directly from the hub, no the world is basically laid out in linear order from left to right like any regular side-scroller, so to get back from one part, you have to traverse all the previous levels to get back and the lack of a map-screen makes it hard at times to remember where you've already been and if you forgot to do something in one place it can take a while to remember where you have to go to get back to a certain place. Of the 3 hours it took me to beat this game, at least a quarter of that went into running back and forth and looking for level exits.   Another problem I have is with the ending so spoiler alert:    When you bring back shards to the machine, it unveils that it basically consists of cages with animals trapped inside them - the same type of animals you find in the whole game in fact. By the end, you have 7 cages filled with 7 animals and the game makes you kill all the trapped animals since their blood powers the machine, which is grim enough. But once you do and the machine powers up it just zooms into the machine, then the screen imitates an old CRT monitor and you're treated to a version of Pong. And once you lose, it tells you your score at Pong and rolls the credits. There's no closure to this here and once you go back into the game, all the animals have died in the place where they last were so you can now fly through a world filled with corpses.     There are also two optional shards you can collect but one of them can only be found at the very end when you already almost beat the game, so I'm not sure why they included it. Maybe there's another secret hidden somewhere but once you collect those two you get a special power whereby you can suck everything in the world towards you. Don't know why and I'm not inclined to go back and investigate any more because in the end, I had limited fun with this game.  Like I said, the overall aesthetic of the game is magnificent, but the final execution simply leaves a lot to be desired. I'm usually the guy who likes these artsy pretentious games because they offer something different but in this case I'm really not satisfied with the result. And of course, and I know I sound like a broken record, but $10 for a 3 hour game where you really don't get to do much is simply too expensive. I bought the game somewhere else and paid less than that but I simply cannot recommend this game at full price for what it offers. Which is a shame because I was really looking forward to playing this when I saw gameplay trailers and screenshots.",
