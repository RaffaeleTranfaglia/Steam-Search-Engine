Over all it inherted all the goods and bad of main base game with a much easier story/gameplay.  The simplest reason is your main character is way too over powered and even on hardest difficulty only first couple of mission pose as any challange at all. 14 quite straight forward level that gamer can proceed though without much save/load at all.  6.5/10 as this DLC add on is a bit too easy and too uneventful.",
