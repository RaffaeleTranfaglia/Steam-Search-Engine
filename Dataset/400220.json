            "review_text": "If you came here from 15 Minutes of Game, you probably think this is some weird mindscrew puzzle game masquerading as a twin-stick shooter. It's not. It's just a twin-stick shooter, and TB, god bless him, has no patience. You're a dot, you shoot other dots, and they drop dots that you collect. When you level up, you get to pick an upgrade. That's the most complicated thing about it; if you move around and fire a little bit after placing a statue in each spot, you'll get an idea of what the upgrades do. There are save points every now and then, they're the satellite dish looking things.  It took me like... two minutes to work all that out. It is an incredibly simple game, and requires only the very smallest desire to experiment. If they made a tutorial for this game, people would likely joke about how unnecessary it is. You'd take one look at the thing telling you to shoot the thing so you can get the thing and say 'oh yeah, haha, I've played this game like five hundred times.'  Comparing it to other twin-sticks, it's fun, but not special. Pretty colors, simple gameplay. The one thing I'm disappointed about is the music. It's a huge letdown, especially considering 'interactive music' was one of the features offered by the description. There aren't any good chiptunes here, it's just very weak bleepbloops all the way down. Bass Blocks was a terrible name for this game, because there isn't any.  I don't regret buying it at all, and if you like simple twin-sticks, you should probably get it, too. But I would've preferred paying $2.50. Wait for a sale event.",
