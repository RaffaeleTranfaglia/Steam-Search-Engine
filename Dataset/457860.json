            "review_text": "I don't write many reviews. This might only be my second. However I felt compelled to write about this experience.  It is....breathtaking. I never dreamt that I would one day know what it felt like to sit in the capsule. Listening to the countdown and commentry. Heart rate increasing. Tension building. Sat with a Rift on in a living room in England and yet transported to Cape Canaveral on that bright July morning.   When you hear those main engines start, I swear you can feel them. That immense power, held in place by the clamps. Then zero is reached and the clamps release. Through the window, a cloud slowly moves past, followed by another one, only faster. White wisps flash by the window now and suddenly, you can see the Earth, slowly falling away.   You realise you haven't breathed for 20 seconds and when you exhale, a big fat tear runs down your cheek. Man, this is emotional. -and then you stage. The main engines cut off, leaving you in a breathless silence. You are in Earth orbit. A quick glance around the cabin leaves you in no doubt. It was then that the full emotional impact of what I'd just experienced hit me like the business end of a Saturn V. I literally cried like a baby. I had experienced spaceflight.  The rest of the experince takes you to further stages of the flight. Leaving Earth orbit, docking with the LEM, moon orbit, insertion and finally landing. Oh boy. Looking out of the window of the Eagle and seeing the Moon's surface getting closer, having a slight panic at the 1202 alarm and finally, touching down in the Sea of Tranquility. All priceless moments.   History will remember Neil's first steps as the defining moment of the Apollo mission, but for this VR experience, the flights were the best parts. Your mileage may vary.  TLDR: Buy it. Support it. It's the best educational use of VR so far and if it doesn't move you to tears, then maybe you don't cry at stuff. :)  10/10 Would be an astronaut again.  Froobyone",

            "review_text": "I feel like this title deserves recommending but begrudgingly so.  It is passably well made and there is value to it, but only in a specific niche.  It's not a simulation, it's kind of a documentary, but not really. As ride alongs on rockets go it's somewhat lackluster and definately lacks any replayability of it's compitors. Objects in the game are well modelled but often the low quality textures take you out of the experience. As it stands the visuals are okay. The strongest thing it has going for is it's use of music to set the mood. It's also quite short.  On the one hand, this is one of the first VR experiences of its type and that is applaudable. Additionally the small user base for VR means it's got to be hard to recoop development costs... But even so it feels overpriced. See even as a VR headset user I'm not going to get anything more out of this and I got little it of it as it was. It's a good demo for showing off to friends to give them an idea of where VR experiences are headed... But it's nothing spectacular in it's own right.  Unless of course you know nothing about the Apollo 11 mission, never heard the JFK speech before, generally experienced little of the moon landing media... Then it's a rather impressive introduction to those things. As a one off.  But for the same money you could buy 3 feature length movies on the topic just as moving and inspiring if not more so. Is it fare to compare the product of a small studio to Hollywood productions? Does that alone justify paying more? That's up to the consumer.   One area they had the chance to stand out was the interactive sequences. Unfortunately experiences are super simplistic and dumbed down or otherwise limited by the controls, plus few and far between. There are a lot of almost unnecassary drawn out external camera shots which while setup to set the mood, would be much more compelling if the player was given control durin them, to take them at their own pace and explore as they will.  That's not to say I don't think the developer hasn't put effort in. But while they are showing off some of the strengths of the medium they are drasticly underutilising others. There is some educational value to the product and it does stand up as a 'demo' but it's not much more then that. I also definately want the developer to make their money back on it so we can see more such VR experiences and better ones as the medium is explored more.  As it stands, unless you have a lot of friends you are trying to show VR off to, have teenagers in the household or are really obsessed with the American space program... I'd wait till this product is on sale. Hopefully when it is it will sell well.    ",

He stood there for the entire experience. I'm pretty sure he teared up at one point. We need more of this in VR, and we need more people to see this 'game' as well.   I pray to see one of these for the Mars landings one day.",

            "review_text": "I was a backer on the KS and after trying the demo which I quite enjoyed, I finally put myself in the full experience on my Vive. Have to say I'm quite underwhelmed by the full experience. It's just very uncomfortable to be in. The outside of the rocket shots where you are floating in space and being pulled around with the camera moving is horribly sickness inducing. In fact I'm trying to still get over it as I type this review.  Also there needed to be better loading screens than what was implemented. You just get kicked out of the experience and see the steam compositor with a bit of text saying LOADING. This really takes you out and it happens often. Loading scenes needed to have been done better as this is quite immersion breaking.   The best part was the shuttle launch, the rest was pretty boring and lack of interaction. Specially on the Vive makes for a dull experience. The moon itself looked awful, as did the landing module and the American flag. Really lacking polish and woe factor.   The audio and radio chatter is quite nice but looking around the moon, i didn't feel immersed in the whole experience.   Graphics could have been a lot better, audio doesn't always sound too good and it's like it was heavily compressed even in good headphones it didn't sound all that crisp and clear.   I'd say try and grab it when it's on sale but not really worth full price. More care and time was needed to add polish to this experience. It is informative and educational and for that I have to commend the team, but it was underwhelming and could have been far better.",

Even just experiencing it on the DK2, I literally had tears coming out when I passed by the moon and saw the Eagle detach from the Command Module. Music was a big factor in this of course, as it pushed me over the edge.",

Trying to land the eagle lander was very challenging and after 20 attempts I gave up lol, but it was fun never the less.  The experience was comfortable for me for the most part, till I got out of the eagle lander and ran around on the moon for a bit and experienced a little bit of motion sickness. Now I'm fairly acclimated to the rift, so someone who may not be used to it might have an stronger reaction.   All in all it's worth the price to experience an historic moment in the history of man.",

Apollo 11 VR is one small step for VR; a giant leap for entertainment. Truly looking forward to seeing where we go from here.  The cinematic mode is probably the best for non-trained Astronauts, I crashed the Eagle a few too many times in the 'interactive' option before reverting back to cinema-mode. Game-play mode wasn't nearly as inspired as the cinematography..",

I did really feel like I was in the command module on the launch pad. But the experience is marred by long load times between sections where you are placed into a grey space with nothing in it which immediately takes you out of the experience. I would suggest avoiding the interactive sections, they are not really that good best just to sit back and enjoy the ride for what it is. As an experience I would give it a 7 out of 10 which I would rate higher except for the long load times between events. As a game I would rate it 2 of 10, this is not a game, they should have skipped putting in interactive expreiences as they were really poorly done.",
