            "review_text": "While I found the setting of this game intriguing, I can't recommend it.  My largest complaint with this title is that I felt like a spectator, and not a participant of the game. I noticed getting told how I felt and what I thought, and most choices just boiled down to me either interacting with others as a normal person, being a complete jerk to them, or ignoring them completely. I can't think of a single choice I made in the game that actually felt meaningful to me.   Another bad thing about this game is that it seems to have 3 chapters. This is only chapter 1, as far as I can tell, and felt incredibly short to me. I actually restarted about 3 or 4 times, and it still only took me 2 hours to beat it. There were also at least 3 times that I was forced into failure as a way of continuing the story, though I only played as a mage, so it may be possible to avoid some of those.   There are other CYOA's out there that aren't going to leave you on a cliffhanger, are longer, and have more varied choice.",

            "review_text": "I just finished my first playthrough, excellent story so far. Others have complained that you don't know if you can do something until you fail, but this adds more risk to the game, it's like in dnd trying to do something and not knowing what you'll roll. Unlike other choice of games I have played (A Study in Steampunk, Choice of Robots, Choice of Romance, and Pendragon Rising) stats are everything in this game. There is no 'right' option to choose from if all of your stats are mediocre, and there seems to be no way to perfect every skill, adding more tact to the game as well.   In short, fun game, especially if you like dnd and would prefer a more difficult text adventure.",
