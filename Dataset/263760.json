This is one of those games that you can pick up very easily and its simple, mindless fun. There is no goal to Turbo Dismount, you kinda just set up a level and watch the carnage. With many customizable options, you can choose how Mr.Dismount explodes or gets beheaded... IN STYLE! If you have a very specific kind of humor and wouldn't find a lifeless body being torn apart and vehicles being ripped apart entertaining (there is no blood in this game as a side note), then this game isn't for you. If you are thinking about buying it and it looks like your cup of tea, go for it! If your looking for a story or an adventure, look elsewhere, because this is the epitome of stupid fun!",

The workshop levels are great also, with famous players like Markiplier, Jacksepticeye playing with those. Some workshop levels are very funny when like a mystery boost pad where you explode into pieces. Even some levels can help get you achievements also. Its my first ever crash game on Steam. If you love crashin', you better buy this game!",

            "review_text": "Turbo Dismount is a game where the little guy falls out of the car and then the car runs him over. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy pedals his tricycle off of a cliff and down five stories onto landmines which launch him up into the air. Turbo Dismount is where the little guy does a loop-de-loop on a section of road and drives straight into a patch of landmines at top speed, making him and his car explode rather spectacularly. Turbo Dismount is where a guy gets into a drag race and finishes it by plowing his car into a wall.  I could tell you about a hundred of these stories, but it's basically a guy, a car, and a set of circumstances in which you have to figure out how to inflict maximum pain on the guy, and the punchline involves grevious bodily harm.  It's a joke you can re-experience and re-tool over and over, but the punchline itself starts to get stale around four hours after you've played out all the variations of 'What happens when an (adjective) (character) in a (type of car) drives into a (insert hazard here)?'. It's a bit like Mad Libs, but with physics and objects.  I don't see myself playing this again anytime soon, but the time I did spend with it was hilarious, and there's a level based off of the Springfield Gorge scene from an early Simpsons episode called 'Bart The Daredevil'. So there's your recommendation.",

If you have some friends round, or you're maybe making a YouTube video, this is great fun, however as you'll see by my hours, it can get boring on your own - quite quickly. This is probably down to the fact that there is no in-game level editor, you instead have to install Unity - which is a breeze for some (1% of the world' population) and an absoloute pain in the backside for others. The mechanics are nice however and watching your 'Dismounts' in slow-mo just feels amazingly satisfying. All in all, I give Turbo Dismount around 6/10.",

I also really like how people can have maps and I just recommend adding a workshop feature where players can create and share vehicles but I don't know if that's in the works or whatever and I dont know if it's too complicated to make the model or someone might make a very realistic or complex vehicle. Also, Maybe there could be another feature where people can make character models so people can play as them, but same with the vehicle part that someone might make something too realistic blablabla...

For that reason alone it is hard to recomend this, but the Developer did recently update it which allows you to move objects around making it more interactive, but once again not really, 'gamelike'. Im glad there is a level editor and steam workshop but if i could at least just drive the vechiles myself i'd lose plenty of hours into this and really recommend this.  The Devolpers pretty much listened! You can drive and much better change interact with the game world. Some may complain about the driving controls being very hard to use but i think it makes driving difficult so that a large amount of crashes and destruction occur!

The premise is simple: you control a crash dummy and your goal is to toss it against vehicles, obstacles and objects to get a high score. There is a fair ammount of customization in the game. The dummy can be strapped to a variety of vehicles (including rides from an office chair to a monster truck). Each of these vehicles allows you to select from different poses in which the dummy can be positioned. You can even upload a photo of a friend/enemy and paste it onto the dummy's head!   There are also different stages, which range from simple straightways to huge intersections of heavy traffic meant to maximize carnage. These stages can also be customized with different obstacles like turbo pads, roadblocks or minefieds. The game also has steam workshop support, allowing you to download additional stages.  After you finish customizing your dummy and stage, you choose a speed and direction and let the physics engine do its thing. The dummy and vehicle can be broken down in multiple itty bitty parts, each increasing your score based on how hard they hit objects in the stage. After things settle down the replay feature kicks in and you can see the carnage in slow motion. As far as I know there's no option to save replays in game. But you'll be creating so many spectacular crashes that it's not a big deal.  While the premise of Turbo Dismount is basic, it has it down right. It calls to the simple pleasures of childhood, in which throwing your toy cars against makeshift buildings or laughing at people falling in America's Funniest Home Videos was all the entertaiment you needed. You always knew what was coming, but you couldn't help but laugh or wince everytime it happened. You may not put hundreds of hours into this game. Yet you'll be glad that when you want you can throw your toy car against traffic and watch the parts fly.",

You have less control than it seems, you can place objects only where the game allows you to.  Basically you have to push a button and let the vehicle crash into random stuff, far from being interactive. The physics it's far from perfects, every vehicles (especially the NPC ones) are mostly made of rubber and don't even get wrecked. The ragdoll effect is acceptable, but I've seen better. I don't see the point of having different characters and motorbikes if they can't ride them for more than a few seconds and barely reach the obstacles you have placed. Every other vehicle is mostly useless, ranging from huge, slow and totally unfunny to see crashing to intolerbly fast cars, seeing them crashing after a second from start. Also most of the time your character will fall out of the vehicle before crashing anywhere, thus ending the session very early. Other than that, you have to follow some predetermined steering paths which the vehicles can't even follow correctly. You have manual steering but it doesn't make the game any funnier. The default cameras are placed very badly, not letting you see anything. You have to use the manual one which is barely good depending on how you can handle it.  It could have been a good idea, but it's very badly developed. I would rather wait for a fully functional BeamNG.",
