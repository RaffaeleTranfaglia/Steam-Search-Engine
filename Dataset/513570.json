Firstly I'm assuming English isn't the first language of the developers. Nothing wrong with that, but please get someone to proof read your text.   Secondly, I was given confusing instructions at the start ie. get the front door key from a basket in the basement. No basket, no key.  Thirdy, there's very little to actually do other than wander through the (rather empty) rooms reading a few notes and picking up keys. There's two 'scary' moments, somewhat ruined by the word RUN appearing in the middle of the screen in bold red font (Yeah, there's a zombie after me, I can figure that out for myself, thanks) after which the game throws out its only puzzle before abruptly ending.  I'm not expecting a horror epic for £2 from an indie dev, but please try to put a little effort in. It was very generic with little to recommend about it.",
