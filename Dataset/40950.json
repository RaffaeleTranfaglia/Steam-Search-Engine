The campaign is challenging and fun whilst keeping you thinking of new ways to take over that pesky Pigs' castle (Still haven't been able to get past that mission). I've played a few multiplayer games and it is quite polished. There is no lag, and if there is, it is either connection lag (99% of the time) or your computer is a potato (1% of the time).  To this day, I say to myself, 'These graphics are perfect for this game'. I have absolutely no problem with these 2001 graphics, plus the HD remake makes it even better by adding bigger resolutions.   The combat is also quite amusing. Woodcutter VS Cavalry? Sure, why not. Don't get me wrong, woodcutters are OP as ♥♥♥♥. I'm not joking, I've seen woodcutters take on cavalry and win. The unit pathing is also simple yet effective and is much, much better than Stronghold 3 and some other games that I have played.   The Map Editor is also simple yet effective and has allowed me to create some pretty cool Free build maps, siege and invasion maps. It also allows you to choose what buildings can be built, how much resources you start with and events that happen throughout that particular game.   Overall, if you are thinking of getting this game, stop thinking and spend the $6 it costs to buy it, because for $6, you can get hours and hours of enjoyment, just like I have, out of this game.  11/10 would build stone stairs up mountains again.  *Edit* I wrote this like a year ago and saw that I spelt something wrong, ('allowes'), so I had to fix it.",

I don't know if the graphics were good at 2001 but i like them and now with the HD edition you can play the game in higher resolutions up to 2560x1600 which is very good. Also the game music is awesome and fits perfectly in this game.  If you like to build castles you should definitely buy this game and also you should try Stronghold Crusader (not Stronghold Crusader 2) because its awesome too, if not the best of all Stronghold games!( ´・ω・`)",

Even after like, what, 12 years from this game's release the graphics, gameplay and experience are still awesome for me. After a few years of not playing it, nostalgia kicks back in and thank goodness Steam has it when I decided to install Steam as one of my game hubs to base my games on. Even though it's has no flashy graphics like Starcraft: Wings of Liberty or Call of Duty, the graphics have most certainly endured. Even I don't know why. Maybe it's because the experience made up for it, or maybe the detail that goes to each building and terrain defies ravages of time. The gameplay, especially if you're into management and simulators like let's say Age of Empires and its similar counterparts like Warcraft, this will DEFINITELY be a breath of fresh air for you. I guarantee it!! After actually playing this game, I couldn't go back to Age of Empires II because as great as Age of Empires is, it simply became lackluster and it's like you had your fill of it and there's nothing new, you know? But Stronghold. It's amazing after a decade I still can replay a game and still feel like I've never played it. Maybe it's because the game as a whole actually FEELS REAL. You see little people, doing their merry little jobs, greeting you if you click on them, and every single one of the living creature has their own name. The logic in this game is absolutely fantastic; it gets you to think how content the people are, how fast the jobs' going to be done, how soon do you need to consider managing the food rations......It feels REAL.  The campaigns are great with a good pace of difficulty, and one of the most amazing trait of this game that amuses me and still makes me smile to this day is how every single character with a voice seems to be voiced by the same guy - and all of them still sounds so different!! Of course they could have added more kinds of dialogues or add even more stuff to make the game more difficult and more real now that I've played it for so long. But then it'll be too hard for the starters, wouldn't it?   This game may not be for everybody, but I strongly suggest anyone, especially ANYONE who's played Age of Empires, Starcraft, Warcraft; BUY THIS GAME. PLAY THIS GAME. It will refresh your dull old expectations for a strategy game of that nature. The price on Steam is not bad either, even without the discounts. I usually just go pirated but it's an insult not to support Firefly Studios for this classic, so I bought it! Just try it out. You won't be disappointed!!",

Its the scribe, i'm so happy. He whispers in my ear 'A message m'lord'. He grabs me with his powerful scribe hands and puts me on my hands and knees. I'm ready. I open my gates for the scribe and he enters my castle. It hurts so much but I do it for the scribe. I can feel my castle tearing as my eyes start to water. I push against his force, I want to please the scribe. He roars a mighty roar as he fills my stockpile. My dad walks in.

PROS:  +Fantastic maps; YES there are indeed a lot less then in Crusader, but the maps that are here are not only balanced but unlike Crusader I like playing all of them instead of there only being a few that I like to play.   +Great music; this game and Crusader have indeed some of the most atmosphereic pieces of music in any game. From slow mandaline as you begin to create your kingdom, to the fan favorite Stcks and Stones which is a huge 10 minute battle melody that changes depending on how the battle is progressing!  +Great graphics; You may be saying 'Is this guy joking' well NO I am not. The graphical style is outdated by today's 3D graphics, but unlike today's 3D graphics the pixel based sprites look vibrant, crisp, and colorful. The green grass isn't blurry but is a nice pixel based style along with the units, buildings, and other things. This game's graphical style is in the same style as RCT1/2 and AOE2:HD.  +Fun multiplayer; This is the ONLY WAY I play this game, the multiplayer is fantastic, with pretty snazy netcode and you can easily see your enemies castle to see how they are doing or if they are about the launch a full fledged attack on you. And holy crap, seeing your castle go from just a small camp to becoming a military power house with industrailzation and over population of people and having to build hundreds of farms just to get enough food is insane to watch.  CONS: +No Skirmish; Crusader fixes this problem but there is no way to play the game against AI so if you want to play a Skirmish type mode you are forced to play Multiplayer.  +Unintuative menu; The menu just looks bad as not only does the background blend in with the buttons on the menu to click but it also includes bad organazation. For example, the multiplayer option is in the Combat Games section which makes sense, but I would just rather have the Muitiplayer option on the front of the screen. Other then that it gets the job done.  +The FPS halves when you attempt to zoom all the way out (Also in Crusader) which is odd and very noticable)  OVERALL: This game is absolutley fantastic, with the multiplayer being the icing on that cake. The music is charming and catchy, and the graphics while basic are crisp and clean. Overall I recomend it even with its problems, and the price is fair with these problems.",

This game defined the castle sim building genre and is the game to beat IMO.  *wanted to mention that the difficulty settings don't appear till mission 4 if you are wondering where they are",
