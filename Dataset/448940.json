If you want to have a little fun, try to change resolution ... after that you know everything about that game and its developer.  Thx Steam for selling such rip offs, but slowly I get used to it. Thats why I here dont buy any games anymore and wait for indiegala or other bundles ...  But ok, Gaben needs more Ferraris ...",
