            "review_text": "This is a simple but fun turn-based strategy game. However, once you cleared the Overlord, you are stuck farming the level which you dont lose troops to recoup your heavy losses. You can only make like 1k gold per battle, and such need to farm this lvl a serious number of times to recover your army before you can even think about clearing the other lvls at the higher difficulty. If they give more gold or allow you to recover some dead troops, this game would be more entertaining. But farming for gold to recoup your loses get rather boring, when all i want to do is try to clear higher difficulties. I had 8 areas cleared with 3 stars, and some with 2 stars before attacking the Overlord.",
