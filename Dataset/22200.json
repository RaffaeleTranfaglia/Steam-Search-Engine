This is the world you're going to get into with this game.  I did not like the melee combat at first, but the story kept me playing, and I ended up finding that the parry hit and run knee to the face smash tactics to be, well....... really good. and by the end of the game I found myself actually wanting to toss my guns down and put my fists up. It's short, but left me satisfied. I hope we see more of this twisted world.",

I love the way that the first person fighting mechanics feel. But the story just could not hold my interest.  The world you are put in is such an interesting and creative one, yet the plot is so jointed and disconnected that I never felt like I got to know the world very well. The story and plot was just too confusing for me to understand. Many aspects just felt unexplained, and the game ends on a sequel hook cliffhanger.  Is the game worth trying? Sure. But personally? I felt the confusing story made the game drag on far too long.",

            "review_text": "absurdism is difficult. that which is otherworldly, that which is abstract understanding, can only stem from relations of relations of corrupted understandings. people gravitate toward things far removed from understanding. people talk and caw about games having disparate worlds, but zeno clash is true. zeno clash features a world so far removed from anything in fiction or in living. its an absolute triumph of visual direction. zeno clash is a textbook on the deranged. with all of my praise though, it does remind one distinctly of oddworld. however, zeno clash’s world is much more lively - less barren to say - and there are many humans. though there are many other creatures as well.  whatever zeno clash ended up looking like, the base idea is something I would sell myself off for. I am incredibly glad this game exists. beat ‘em ups are eternal for me. what rings incredibly true for zeno clash is how traditional it is. you fight with two kinds of punches, light and heavy. a light punch can strike up to three times and can be comboed into a strong. strong punches are kind of like a wind up punch; space yourself away from your target and dash in with your fist. both are incredibly satisfying thanks to impeccable animation and hit detection. if an enemy becomes dazed, they can be thrown. and that’s basically it. the basic tendency calls back the roots of the beat ‘em up genre, a very comfortable thing for me, and a very different trace of influence for a modern game. especially considering the direction beat ‘em ups have taken with devil may cry, ninja gaiden, and god of war - although those are fantastic titles - it’s nice to see a game toning things back. except, I’d probably enjoy a hyper-complex combat system more, in all honesty.  if zeno clashed revolved around limited arena battles punching the trash out of fugly foes, and in saying that it does anyway, then it’d be a fantastic game that anyone looking for new ideas in their vidcons should play. it wouldn’t raise any intellectual hell, but exist as something more primal than serious sam, with an even goofier atmosphere. the boxing arenas are still totally worth it. but what was a successful formula gets bogged down by forced variance. ace team wasn’t content with the gold they struck - or maybe the gold was struck from altering their original first person shooter formula? either way, there are guns in the game. shoehorned guns. guns that are not fun to shoot or use. if they were options to use in the battle royals then they would be tarnishing, but forgivable. they are not. the gunplay is forced numerous times. thankfully they are not long, yet the damage is still felt. it’s not like anything is broken with the guns - it’s just they’re incredibly mediocre compared to your fists. the endworld is an exception to that with interesting and fun ranged combat. though pacing of using a magic wand leaves some to be desired and the enemies you fight are nothing more than zombies, it’s still darkly enchanting.  ranged weapons present one problem and melee weapons present another. melee weapons have a light swing and a heavy swing, much like your hands. once again, they function like they always have in the genre. they’re usually satisfying to use and offer a break from cracking skulls with your knuckles all day. the problem isn’t in the melee weapons, but when you’re given them. not too often can you use them against normal facepunchers. heavyweight enemies can only be damaged and toppled by heavy weapons and only the charge attack really does any damage. this leads to very mediocre and unsatisfying fights. there are no gambits allowed, no subcombos to pull off, no variety to speak of. you distance yourself, wind up attack, strafe, bash, retreat, repeat. and zeno clash will just throw these fatties at you as the game progresses. they’ll be one with small guys, one coming right after another, and at one point in the game two at a time. the two at a time encounter is pretty damn cool honestly. still, they are static and unfun encounters, and drag down what should be the pinnacle of the game.  if zeno clash had a more organic presentation it would be legendary. if you traversed large and odd levels, fisting waves of enemies, it would have ascended. even if it had rather linear levels with stop and fight sequences, it still would have delivered a wholly amazing game. instead you’re more often that not pitted in smallish arenas to fight your rounds. there are more traditional fps orientated levels to be found, but in those you do not punch, which is all the more confusing. levels are relegated to being plot excerpts filled with gameplay, instead of having the plot compliment the gameplay. its pacing is haphazard and disappointing. it wants to have this grand adventure and yet its levels are arcade in nature. not like double dragon arcade, but dig-dug. they’re just rounds. that feeling is even more horribly accented in the second half when you repeat most of the places you already walked through on your return trip home, just with harder enemies.  sheer repetition is zeno clash’s greatest flaw. guns are no different from eachother besides how many bullets sit in the chamber. melee weapons offer no variation aside from different looking skins. both guns and weapons have wonderful models, but that’s not the kind of variation I’m vying for. there are many different and awesome looking enemies. those many different awesome looking enemies will be fought two to even three times each. their names are the same, I guess they are the same people, but when you fight the same enemies in the same level as a few hours before it feels really freaking lazy. with the two bounty hunter confrontations, both very great despite relying on poor gunplay, it’s more than obvious that ace team really wanted variation in their game. so the design choices in the meat of their game sit in ugly defiance to their vision. a real frustrating execution overall.  writing is stilted. purposefully, the characters need to assume their roles as midsavages. there is a mighty depth and conviction to the script. made up words and made up accents. though, the voice acting does not match the quality of writing, and is rather poor. the story itself, framed as a mystery, compliments the game’s piecemeal length. when it’s all said and done though the plot is a bit flat. it’s not really about what ghat did so much as ghat dealing with why he did it. with the characters being in a generally unrelatable state of mind, the implications aren’t so interesting to learn about. what’s great about the script is the weird things, the corwids, father-mother’s society, the endworld, golem’s crypticness. these things really draw you in. it succeds in vision and skill of writing even if it does not have the running time to tell a deep story.  zeno clash is an addled burst of fraught strangeness smoothed with brand new gameplay. its short length makes it very easy to recommend, but it also is its greatest limiter with unrealized ideas all over the place. zeno clash is a small game and isn’t content with it. because of that, I’m not exactly content with it either.",

I haven't seen such hauntingly alien landscapes and settings since Morrowind, the visual desing in this game is excellent with every location being memorable and every character becoming quickly recognizable at a glance. The combat is fresh, easy to learn but difficult to master and very satisfying which is amazing when you consider this is a first person fighting game! Even the plot feels like something vibrant and different, while fairly simple and some what predictable, you are presented with a rich and detailed world that oozes life and history but never feels the need to bog things down explaining itself.   The closest thing I can think of to bring up as criticism is that the sound design is very lacking, the music is so forgettable that it may as well not be there and the voice actors seem strictly amateur. It's also very short, there is some replay value with multiple endings and a challenge mode but it's still only a few afternoons worth of play. These are however very minor flaws in an otherwise beautiful game.  At the price this goes for during sales you owe it to yourself to experience this.",

            "review_text": "TL;DR – The most this caveman brawler gives you in terms of plot and setting exposition is a moderately-short blurb on the game’s store page. Also, one of the enemy models closely resembles a *ToTaLLy MEtAl* version of the Swedish Chef from “The Muppet Show”. Recommend.   Onto the review:  It’s actually to Zeno Clash’s benefit that it doesn’t really explain itself outside of the basic gameplay mechanics, which are simplistic but nevertheless require a bit of finesse if you’re playing on any of the higher difficulties. To elaborate, combat is your typical mouse-bound primary-light-attack, secondary-heavy-attack affair, utilizing the spacebar for blocking and evading. Uncoordinated lout that I am, this was interpreted as “spam the secondary/primary and run around like a chicken sans head”. This 'style' of gameplay actually worked for me, thanks to the normal-level difficulty setting I was playing on, in addition to smartly-placed health items in each area.   Unfortunately, this is also the likely cause of the game’s growing tediousness later on, as, outside of a few close calls and even some deaths, I was just smashing through opponents in area after area. To offset this, there is some variety in the stages; for example, a brawling sequence being followed by a shooting gallery level, or some other contrivance (like using a magic torch to light up pyres and moving statues alike). And the guns, oh the guns.   Indeed, the weapons in Zeno Clash most succinctly sum up the game’s overall art aesthetic; the closest comparison in décor is that of “The Flintstones”, with its brightly-colored yet naturalistic designs. Hell, there’s even dinosaurs (or at least large reptiles resembling them) in a level or two. The guns themselves specifically piqued my interest, as the idea of a primeval-era slugthrower is just surreally fantastic. For example, the pistols, which basically appear to be carved shells with a bunch of nails and rocks stuffed into them, are just fun to look at and use in all of their pea-shootery goodness (which may also explain why I keep running into the same named characters again after I so thoroughly obliterate their asses).   Besides the art design, this sense of backwards absurdity is ingrained in the plot and characters; outside of the aftermentioned blurb, the game leaves it up to the progression of the narrative itself to explain what the hell is going on, eking out small bits of info through dialogue and actions. It's a refreshing break from grandiose blocks of text that describe a game's lore in exacting detail, but I fear the world of Zeno Clash might still be too alien to experience without detailed explanation for some players. At the same time however, it's that same feeling of unknowingness that may spur other players (myself included) to push on and immerse themselves in the absolute weirdness that is this game.   Final words: Zeno Clash is so aesthetically 'out there' that it may dissuade players from digging into it, but the fairly-conventional combat system, in addition to a relatable (if somewhat vague) storyline, signifies that this 5ish-hour-long brawler is still worth playing for a couple of bucks.",

The voice acting is atrocious, the gameplay is severely lacking and repetative, and I'm not even sure if there's an actual story, despite their efforts.  There's only so much an indie or 'non A+++' game can get away with before you have to stop treating it like a child's kindergarten project, giving it A's for effort. The one time I thought the game was going to do something interesting, or reveal what the actual plot was about, and it just immediately shoehorns you into a boss fight - the same exact one that you've already done half way through the game. That's all that ever happens; cutscene, pointless fight. Cutscene, pointless fight. Do you get to do anything to advance the plot? Explore? Manage an inventory (re: choose what weapon to carry around with)? No. Every 'level' or whatever you want to call it will choose how you will start the fight, that means it will either take away anything you were carrying at the time, or give you a random weapon and make absolutely zero effort on explaining why this happens.  The majority of the game, you have a companion... but does she do anything to be even remotely helpful? No. During one of the boss fights that has no rhyme or reason (like much of the game), this character perches herself up on a vantage point with a rifle, and what does she do? SHOOTS THE CRABS SKUTTLING AROUND... I'M DEAD SERIOUS. All she ever does is gets up on a vantage point, and does virtually nothing. You can hear her shooting at times, but at what, I have no idea.  For the first hour or so, I kept asking myself... why did I get this game? And then, the question turned into: what the hell is this game even trying to do? I don't understand how or why this game has a sequel. I really don't. I forced myself to play through to see what the hub-bub was about, and was just as disappointed at the end as I was at the start. Easily the longest, least-deserving 3 1/2 hours of my life.  A game needs more than interesting visuals and a 'well, they tried' attitude to warrant being as popular and highly praised as this one is. Please avoid at all costs, even if that cost is $1.99. It's not worth it.",

            "review_text": "Regardless of some of the games shortcomings, this game is highly enjoyable with a very pleasurable 1st-person brawler experience makes for some very solid gameplay that is refreshing to enjoy.    I want to get right into things and talk about the combat first. The combat is fun and is surprisingly fluid. Probably one of my biggest issues with the combat system is the enemies invicible times. Enemies can always override your attacks but there's a lot of times when enemies will commit to a attack and are completely invincible. Making it so you take unncessary damage and it kind of ruins the flow of the game I found. Sometimes you can't even dodge their attack when executing a perfect dodge to counterattack. But overrall the combat is fair game.  In the combat you are either using your bare hands to beat the living snot out of your enemies in a awesome intense fashion, or you're picking their health off with a gun from afar.  The combat keeps it very simple with the controls but also makes for some intense fighting. It's really hard to explain how the combat controls work via text over doing a live commentary for example and talking about how they work in the game itself. But the game has a what I'd say fair learning curve with a stiff challenge you may not be prepared for in skill yet. But ultimately you'll learn how to conquer your foes even if it has you going back a chapter or two to do some training. Which really isn't that big of an issue since the fighting in this game is fun as heck. You'll give your old enemies the one-two-puncharoo and you'll pick up some knew combat techniques (skill specifically, the game locks some advanced combat early game. But all results in combat are based on your skill and use of the controls) and be trained enough to learn how to take out tougher enemies.   I liked the soundtrack, it wasn't perfect. But it was nice and I can remember a few specific tracks that fit my fancy. They fit the fighting scenarios well and they really helped you get into fights, I give them credit for making soundtracks that pumped me up some in a lot of these battles and levels.  The art directive was really strange, I wouldn't say it was memorable or enjoyable persay. But it was interesting to look at and look forward to for their next environments and people. Though I had an issue with the level designs. In the sense of the backgrounds. Everything a little above level eye sight which would be the middle of the screen was sickingly blurry. It was like this in pretty much every level. I had to keep my eyes on the ground and the middle of the screen or I felt sick.  The voice acting was poor in it's own right, but that doesn't really matter. Same with the story, the story was kind of weird and didn't really make any sense besides your were just running away from your home because of your actions. But the story and voice acting and art and some of the blurry vision in the levels really pale in how good the action in this game was.    I know I didn't do a good job at explaining the combat at all, i'd definitely suggest watching a video of it on youtube. But the action brawling in this game is really good fun. It was an experience I was happy to partake in and i'm glad I played this game.    I got this game through trading for it, for it was in a bundle. I heard the game was good and I gave it a try and i'm now here to tell you that is indeed the case. I'd suggest getting it price cut of at least above 5 bucks. Anything below that is just criminal. Though this game is priced at $9.99 or your regional equilivalent and I'd say this game is worth the full price. It's good and I can't say i'd feel bad if I dropped ten bucks on this game. Because even after beating the game there's a challenge mode in-which you beat the crap out of people for numerous amounts of floors and that's jolly good fun too.   So anyways, Zeno Clash. If you don't mind a game that is highly action-oriented and with great combat and that's very fast-paced and alive. Get this game, it's really enjoyable.    Anyways, thank you for reading my review. I hope you found it helpful for considering if you want to purchase this game or not, have a good one.",

If it had multiplayer, I could fully understand the appeal, but it doesn't even have multiplayer, all it has is a madly hard-to-follow story and interesting visuals. That's all it's merits. Sure it's in a nice niche of quick-time events that you just have to know when to do so, and it might take a fair bit of skill to really get good at it, but you don't have time for that. The entire game feels no different from Call of Duty in the way that along the story, you move forward and OOPS YOU CAN'T GO ANY FARTHER BECAUSE MONSTERS, and then it's just fight after fight, a cutscene that makes zero sense, rinse and repeat, and then the game's over; the only real difference being that in Zeno Clash the guns aren't even guns and your companion does nothing to help you even though she's probably capable. She just stares at you during your short-lived fights and makes no effort to actually drive the thing.  All in all, the game is too lacking to get a 'yes' from me.",

There is another option to play it a challenge mode, so far I have not tried it why can not express my opinion on it. The game is definitely worth $ 10, but just wait a discount. 8.3/10",

They are not the same run of the mill looks you see in most games they put thought and creativity into it.   Action is fast paced and fun I mean I cant remember playing a game where the weapons can be knocked out of your hand and you then fight bare handed. Bare handed is done perfectly to with everything you want fatigue, blocking, dodging and power punching to break the enemy's blocks. You can daze your opponent then throw them, knee them or uppercut them to the ground run over and kick them. You can also run over and throw an elbow. The only games with better fist fighting is fight night and UFC. The guns are pretty original and creative 5 of them then there is grenades and two melee weapons.   Seriously this is one of the best games I have played in a year really became addictive at points challenging but never frustrating. Had a weird but nice story not over played or dramatic with a really good ending. The only thing I can say bad its only about 5-6 hours But you get so much for what you pay for.",

The story is very weird and possibly off putting to some, (warning: you will fight the same people over and over, but in different circumstances and with new challenges added in) but it comes together in the end fairly well and can be challenging at times. Seeing as like only 5 guys made this game I was thoroughly impressed and glad that I played it. I'm looking forward to playing the second installment in the coming months.

The story is a bit meh, and just goes so deep into this worlds bizzare lore that it gets a bit muddled. Really it's just for playing through once and going 'well that was interesting', then never touching it again.  Lets hope Zeno Clash 2 is better.

The easy difficulty can get pretty hard and autosaves can put you in a tough spot (fortunately, there's two so you can go back a bit further).   The combat is interesting, although I found it hard to dodge because it's a two-action sequence (block and then move) instead of a chord or single button. For controller users, there's no auto-aim for ranged weapons, I couldn't get the sensitivity low enough for precise aiming, and the reticle is hard to see so shooting can be difficult.  There's other minor things that feel unpolished like delays after finishing a fight where nothing happens and the bad voice acting of the main character, but I still like Zeno Clash because it feels so different. Your companion's voice acting is great, many of the other characters are good, the mix of melee and ranged combat works well enough, the world is beautiful and strange, and the struggle of the protagonist (while not sold through the acting) is interesting and isn't the standards save-the-world cliche.
