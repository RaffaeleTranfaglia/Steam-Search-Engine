The types of weapons you get are gifted to you by the chickens you slaughter. You get little weapons or satalites that follow you around and you can fry them with a giant plume of fire. After you eat enough chicken you built up bombs of explosive gas. Just press enter to shoot your fart bomb you've been saving up for.  This really is a cluckin good game! I highly recommend it to everyone that has a fear of chickens!",

You can unlock cosmetic stuff for your ship, which can keep your interest as well. If you live in the Midwest, you'll enjoy the humor more. Particularly if you're from Wayne Nebraska and have been forced to experience the Wayne Checken Show you will understand the humor. It's almost like the town collectively funded this game for the show. Oh, and if you have no idea what the The Wayne Checken Show is Google, 'Wayne Chickendales.'",

I've played all the original Chicken Invaders, and love how each new game to the series adds something new and interesting. With this game being new weapons, maps, waves and unlockables.  Took about 2 hours to complete the game on the easiest difficulty, after one failed attempt, enjoyed it with no real sense of tedium. There are many, MANY unlockables and customization to keep you busy, I can see lots more runs before getting bored then coming back to it every now and then.  Overall, it's a great game at a great price.",

Blast space chickens, get power ups, play with a friend. Lots of different weapons. Good sound, good graphics, simple controls. Everyone can learn to play in minutes but still be challenged by the increasing difficulty of the game.",
