Also there's loads of comfort / movement options to choose from and you can change them on the fly in the game which is always nice.  The only downside is that it's pretty short and it's arguably expensive for such a short story but I guess that's the trend for VR games since it's such a niche market.  Other than that, 5/5, would recommend to anyone owning a Rift / Vive.",

Its very short, but the voiceacting and sounds are good and the graphics are one of the best until now (I have over 65 VR Games played, only a few are on this level). The story would be boring on a normal 2D screen, but here you get sucked into the world and story.  However, it has a few downsides: -If you dont have your VR Legs yet, you might feel discomfort while moving. -Very short -Chapter one is very slow, the game begins to kick in with chapter two. -A lot of slow walking (not realy a negative for me, but for impatient persons)  Besides that it has great moments.  If you want more storytelling in VR you should buy this game.",

Time to play target practice with a doll!  Overall, it feels like the devs bit off more than they could chew. There are a ton of voiced Characters, for example, which have nice looking models but are *very* wooden feeling with little facial and hand animation. It was just super hard to get sucked into the world or the story.  FATED looks pretty good in screenshots but I noped out of it after half an hour.",

The opening scene is on a moving wagon :) But I made it up until I had to walk forward .. then it was all over.  Will try it again when they support snap forward or some sort of teleport.",
