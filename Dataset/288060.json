            "review_text": "Whispering Willows is a side-scrolling adventure. It does have its horror elements (and a few 'EEK!' moments) but overall this is a game of exploration and story-discovery.   Options include choice of Controls (I used the default), separate sliders for Sound Effects and Music, a slider for brightness (so we can choose how environmentally dark we want it!), Language, Fullscreen/Windowed, Screen Resolution, and Graphics Quality.  All of the controls are given to you as you play but I'll list them here for you, anyway. ;) The default controls are as follows: Arrow keys or W-A-S-D for movement, E for Inventory, Q to switch to your astral form, Esc. for Menu or Cancel, and Space or Enter to interact with things.  Since the gameplay is exploration-based, the devs chose not to add a running ability... but they changed their minds after getting feedback from the fans. You can run when you are OUTSIDE ONLY by holding down the Shift key.  You CAN miss things if you don't take the time to explore everywhere -- don't make assumptions that what looks like a dead-end is *actually* a dead-end! For the most part, you won't be able to miss things, however. Any time your character touches something important, you'll get a pop-up at the top of the screen telling you to hit the Space key to pick it up, possess it, move it, or whatever interaction is necessary at the time. You can look at your inventory at any time, but you don't actually need to -- all inventory items are automatically used when you need them.   The story is told via notes and letters that you find as you explore. I recommend reading them immediately, and you can do so by hitting the Esc key when you find them (the game will tell you that every time you find one of them :p ) If you're not sure which character wrote the letter, just hit the Esc key -- you'll see the newest note's name highlighted. ie. William Wortham 3/15.  As you explore you will discover and -- in your spectral form -- be able to talk to the many ghosts that populate the grounds, as well as 'possess' items for a short time and squeeze through small openings. Although these openings have little sparkles around them, I *still* managed to miss a couple. Another way to notice those small areas is to switch to your spirit form. When you get near one, you'll switch from your full-form to a little bluish flame.  So how do you know when to switch forms? You are wearing an amulet, and when it starts to glow, you know that you are getting near a ghost. Otherwise, you just need to keep an eye out for small spaces, and things that don't quite look right.  You might think that being a side-scroller, there would not be much depth to your environment, and you'd be wrong. ;) There are multiple layers to every area you visit, not just 'front' and 'behind'. My preferred method of play is to fully explore an area before going through any doors or going up/down stairs, but that's not necessarily what works best in this case. 'Nuff said.   You CAN die in a few spots, but luckily you won't have to re-do much, as the automatic saves are well-spaced. Survival is not dependent on reflexes, it's all about patience and/or moving your character to the right place.  Overall, I enjoyed the game, and think it was definitely worth playing.",

            "review_text": "First impressions are here. I cover what's postive/negative about the game. Short version: It's a beautiful game that plays somewhat unintuitively, with simple mechanics. Its horror slant is certainly lacking, but that doesn't necessarily detract from the game. All-in-all, an impressive first effort, hope to see some better mechanics the next time around (assuming Night Light goes on to other proects).",

As you can see in the comments, the devs have listened to player criticism and corrected some bugs. They contacted me to detail one particular bug I found. I can only commend them for their efforts, and wish them the best on their next game. Hopefully others can learn from their attitude.    Cons     Awful art during cutscenes    You never get to do anything interesting with the possession mechanic    The game doesn't offer any semblance of challenge    Veredict  It's a rather dull game with pretty visuals that can be beaten in less than three hours. I'd only recommend it to point-n-click lovers that got it in a bundle.",

It leeans more on the story side of things than a game. You do have puzzle elements to figure out, but you can solve everything just by exploring everywhere and picking up the items you come across. It really is unravelling the mystery of the house through talking to ghosts and reading the notes and letters you find that is the fun part. And the artwork for the game really is quite nice looking. Takes about 2 to 2 1/2 hours to play through from start to finish.",

There are a lot of 'notes' and messages you collect throughout the game, can't say they add a lot to the experience. Even so, the atmosphere of the game is tense and frightning. The music is a bit weak. The game is a tad short (3.9 hours for me, and this includes a lot of backtracknig 'dead' time) so I don't recommend buying it for full price but only when there's a sale.",

The story for about 90% of the game is through notes and your diary. There are random ghosts around that give you a very small amount of their backstory and a glimpse into the game but they are more-so there to forward the plot or give subtle hints. This game is the definition of linear, not replayable and over in 2 hours at 100% accomplished. Also it has an infuriating enemy in it being spiders, which you cant see - only hear a little - that instantly kill you if youre beneath them. At 15 dollars you're not getting a whole lot of game - I would probably wait for a bundle or a sale.   Id give this game a 2 out of 5",

The controls of this game are perfect, just like cream on a lovely Victoria sponge cake. The story truly is the core of this game don’t, expect action and fps here. I would agree with the puzzle part in this game, the horror…not so much, I can’t really play horror as I’m usually a scared ♥♥♥♥ but this one isn’t very scary. The atmosphere is glim and dark with the expected night time all game long. There is friendly ghosts and the freaky monsters that come to get you, with nothing to fight back with btw.  So yeah this game is pretty good!! I would recommend it to everyone actually as the story is interesting enough to keep you playing till you finish the whole game.  Its a real shame i wish more people knew about this game and more played and enjoyed the experiace. Strongly recommended 9/10.",

I don't even know. -Whole thing feels like one fetch quest. Puzzles are primitive. -Cutscene drawings are just plain bad.  -Not being able to run indoors is... well, boring. -Enemies are rather annoying, not challenging.  *Adding 10 game references to obvious places does not automatically make your game good. *The game is short. In 2 hours I've done everything. But the price is good (?). I guess it balances out.",
