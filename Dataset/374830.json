            "review_text": "Defend The Highlands isn’t your typical Tower Defense or Real Time Strategy game. There is no mazing you need to do; it is just a matter of strategically locating your towers. Just setting down a tower isn’t enough though, you still need to place a unit in it for it to function. This adds up to an interesting twist in the standard Tower Defense genre. The individual towers and the worker units can all be skilled up by spending the skill points earned during each mission. While it isn’t the best Tower Defense games I have ever played, it is one of the more unique ones.   This game pokes fun at the various stereotypes of the British people. You play as the Scots… the drunken, porridge eating, haggis loving, golf playing, bagpipers. Are you low on units? Start belting out a tune on your bagpipes and the Scots for miles around will come join your cause to push back the evil British forces. You can then give the Brits what for with golfing snipers, haggis catapults, porridge shotgun cannons, turnip machine gun turrets and don’t forget the Bagpipe artillery. Alternatively you can poison them with the drunken haze surrounding your pub or crush them with a well rolled wheel of cheese. As you can see, the towers in this game are all quite hilarious. You also attract allied heroes to join you in your quest to overthrow the rest of Britain.  The enemy forces are just as amusing and stereotypical! I don’t want to spoil the fun by giving too much detail about the enemy so I’ll describe just a few to give you an idea. There are the posh British people who throw tea pots at you from great distances, the quick Welsh sheep riders and the Irish Potato farmers just to name a few. They tend to come at you in waves until you have killed every last one of them much like other tower defense games.  The game is not without its faults though. Unit pathing can be quite an issue. Often you place a tower down and tell a unit to go control it just to find the unit hung up on something and unable to reach the controls of the tower. It would be nice if the unit could teleport into the correct positon to control the tower if it is able to touch the tower, but sadly it does not which leads you to have to destroy the tower losing all the gold it took to make it. Sometimes the battlefield’s uneven surface can cause you to miss position your tower causing it to hit the ground despite looking like it should have a clear shot. The units will automatically run to any open tower or cover location when they first enter the field, unfortunately if there is something in their way they may end up caught on it and just infinitely run into a wall rather than trying to find a new path. Another issue I found was in the last mission. After playing for a while, my towers were randomly building way up in the sky where I could not control them. This led me to have to finish the battle with just my units which luckily I had skilled up throughout the game.   Pros:   Nice spin on the Tower Defense and Real Time Strategy genre    Amusing theme and story   Fun towers and enemies   Colourful dialogue   Even if you fail the mission, you retain your skill points earned, making it easier when you retry the mission   Vast Skill Tree which allow you to make the game feel a little different when you replay it.   Simple controls, no micromanagement needed.   Bagpipes  Cons:   Skill Tree likely will lead you to using the same few towers every match due to the rest of the towers not being upgraded yet.   Pathing issues, ability to place your tower in a spot that will make it useless despite it looking like a proper spot. Units may run into a wall infinitly rather finding a new path on their own.   Game bugged in last mission making it harder than it was meant to be. I enjoyed the challenge, but others may not.   You do not get any kind of refund for removing a tower and you are unable to move them once placed. A slight misplacement of a tower can cause it to shoot the ground rather than at the enemies.   It can be very unforgiving in later levels when the enemy begins sending massive waves half way through the battle. One mistake can set you down a losing path without much hope of recovery.   It's a little short.   Bagpipes   Overall, Defend The Highlands is a humorous take on the Tower Defense and Real Time Strategy genres. If you are able to look past the bugs and pathing issues then you should definitely consider Defend The Highlands.",
