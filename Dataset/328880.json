At heart, all HOG are just for the hunt-and-peckers in us, and there's many mini-games that are fairly challenging, but to get to the actual mini-games, you gotta go through a whole bunch of pretty terrible paths. I wish the game would just give you the various games to play as some of them I had to skip due to difficulty, but wouldn't mind going back and trying my hand at them.  DO NOT PLAY FOR THE STORY. There's none. or if there's one, its pretty terrible.   All in all, skip. save your money, save your hard disk space.",

Unfortunately it's very short (3 hours) and it ends so suddenly that you can't really understand if it's a fault or if there will be a sequel. My advice is to get it on sale (I got it with a bundle).",

            "review_text": "Space Legends is a decent hidden object/point &amp; click game. You are in control of Elizabeth, who is trying to save the one she loves. You move around to several locations in a big effort to get back home.  The story is lacking in depth and background but…really isn’t that bad. I was still driven by the story to continue on and find out what happens.   The puzzles are good and varying in difficulty. Although the lack of direction and understanding some puzzles caused a little frustration.  The hidden object scenes were great and I always looked forward to them. The hidden object(s) may require several steps before you can collect them (obstructed, not complete, out of reach, etc). However, there weren’t enough of them! For the handful of scenes they had, they were used more than once in each location.   Environments were nicely detailed and the music seemed to match each environment. The only time I noticed the music is when it abruptly stopped and started over again.   This game was definitely translated over to English as the grammar and spelling is incorrect in multiple places. Although, I could tell when they were trying to go for in those situations.  One last point, the ending. It’s abrupt and I was taken by surprise. I would have been fine with a cinematic of how things turned out, etc. But it’s a 3 second ending and then the credits roll.    Pros  +Great hidden object scenes +Detailed environments +Puzzles were good and moderately challenging   Cons  +Not enough hidden object scenes +Bad English translation +Story lacking a bit +Hint button can accidentally be pressed +A few backtracking points +Abrupt ending  I can ONLY recommend this if it’s on a .99 sale or you get it in a bundle. The $9.99 price is way too high for the content you get. Otherwise, it’s a decent hidden object game that will keep you engaged for a handful of hours and test you on some of its puzzles.    5/10  Average",
