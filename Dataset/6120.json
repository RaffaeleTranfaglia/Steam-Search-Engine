There's a little bit gore and brutal scenes especially on the boss kills. You start with 3 different weapon classes, melee = chainsaw (yeah!) double pistols (akimbo style, you can fly during shooting in the air because of recoil wtf?) and 2 daggers to pounce on enemies. Somehow the movements and controls are a little bit clunky. I even experienced some lags with over 300 FPS.  The big plus is the strange atmosphere. The background music supports it much and feels like a neverending Quentin Tarantino soundtrack. The big minus are the controls and fights. Enemies are able to block gunshots and can dogde around you in the background. Mostly the gameplay is like in Double Dragon. (you can also finish a just local co-op campaign). Enemies with ridiculous names appear from both sides and you have fight them down to proceed. You can pickup some powerups (grenades, health) or special weapons (grenade launcher, flamethrower) but it's just rarely.  The hard mode is really very hard. Even if you manage to kill properly all enemies on the map. There remain these annoying jump sequences. Once you fall down you have to repeat the whole level (in hard mode there are no savepoints). Or you just get hit by a grenade on the slackline or accidently change sides on a climbing pole. Sometimes windows don't break if you try to jump through ...",

You should also take a look into the cooperative game, because it provides a decent background story for the singleplayer campaign.

            "review_text": "By the time of this late review, you've probably have already made your mind about this nearly 3 year old game. I'm simply reviewing to state my interpretation. Shank is a revenge tale played in a 2D platforming brawler. Gameplay is somewhat comparble to the Devil May Cry series, with a standard attack, a secondary weapon attack and guns that can be switched on the fly, grapple and pounce moves, and a grenade to cause heavy damage. The combat is pretty simplistic, and often spammy, as mashing the standard attacks is sometimes the best way to deal with single enemies and small groups. That isn't to say there isn't some complexity with the fact that some enemies can shoot from afar, block or dodge your attacks, or perform unblockable power attacks. The majority of the combat boils down to managing gun shooters and grenade throwers while a handful of standard grunts and a 'big guy' or two that require you to dodge or block their attacks. Platform segments are simple and are nearly automatic, but can become a little annoying when you miss a grab point or are hit by a projectile mid-jump.  The game's simplicity is both it's main pro and con - it's a simple, very short story with easy to grasp controls and enjoyable 'mindless bloodshed'. It also means the game becomes fairly predictable and leaves most the game easily beat by 'spamming main attack' or 'spamming pistols' until you win (this will not always work though, and it pays to mix it up on tougher enemies and large groups). I beat it in less than 3 hours, which is crazy short, but I'm also perfectly fine with that because any longer probably would have outstayed it's welcome for me. (another backlogged title defeated!).  You won't find the new revolution in brawlers here, but you have a solid action title that's enjoyably mindless.",

            "review_text": "A number of Steam reviews, which I can only hope/presume have been written by exceedingly YOUNG people, seem to refer to the similarities between this game and a very recent movie series going by the name of 'Machete'. These kids clearly need to track down some OLDER films - not to mention read some comics (y'know, those things they used to make with PAPER) - and generally catch up on their 'grindhouse' and 'exploitation' history a little.    First of all, before Robert Rodriguez got involved with Machete, there was Grindhouse, in which there was a fake PREVIEW for Machete. Before that, he directed a little film (which bears an equal amount of similarity to this game) called Desperado. THAT was a sequel-of-sorts to his very modest FIRST film, called El Mariachi. We could then go on to mention that some guy named Quentin Tarantino started making (by-and-largely BETTER) films around the same time of somewhat same-ish ilk, and if we REALLY wanted to get pedantic we could acknowledge that there have in fact been DECADES full of movies directed by guys with names like John Woo and Sam Peckinpah without whom, let's face it, NONE OF THIS would have existed. Oh, and then there's comic writers and artists like Frank Miller, who not only co-directed the film adaptation of his Sin City comics (with a certain aforementioned Rodriguez character), but whose distinctive silhouetted-action art-style (which he's been doing for decades) is co-opted more than once in the course of...THIS VERY GAME! Which we should probably start talking about, in all fairness (since this is supposed to be a review of it an' all). SO ENOUGH WITH THE MACHETE REFERENCES ALREADY, OKAY?! The SEVENTIES were FULL of movies which could just as readily be cited as influences to this game. And action anti-heroes were rapidly firing twin pistols back in the EIGHTIES, boys and girls, in ASIAN movies no less! Anyway, enough geriatric ranting, on with the review.    Shank is good. REAL good. And kinda hard. Sometimes REAL hard. But is it unique? No. Just as its INFLUENCES (see last paragraph, just in case you missed it) aren't exactly brand-new, neither is the gameplay. But is there anything wrong with this, when the game is by-and-largely good old-fashioned 2D side-scrolling beat-'em-up FUN?! OF COURSE THERE ISN'T!! I mean, I don't play many of these games these days, but just 'cause an idea is OLD doesn't mean it's inherently 'bad'. Sure, it adds some SEMI-modernisms, like oodles of bloodshed and endearingly cartoonish visuals, but it's basically the same-old, same-old, albiet done WELL. And there ain't nuthin' wrong with that in MY book. Apart from some slightly ♥♥♥♥♥♥/awkward platforming bits and a baffling inability to assign any of the buttons to the mouse if you choose to play with keyboard, there really isn't that much to complain about.     Well, okay, one thing. I actually got the ♥♥♥♥♥ and threw in the towel on the chapter immediately preceding the final boss battle, because I honestly do lack the patience these days to keep fighting the same twenty-seven guys over and over and over again in order to yet yet again reach that one bit where I keep dying, and the game's sudden, stubborn lack of check-points was forcing me to do just that. Like I mentioned above, I'm gettin' old, so 'beating' the VAST MAJORITY of the game is good enough for me, in all honesty. A quick peek at a video walkthrough confirms that I didn't miss much, anyway. Like I said...nothing truly new and ground-breaking here, but very solid entertainment for anyone with the patience and skillz (dat's skillz wit' a Z, ya'll) to see it through. Guess I should try the sequel some time, too...    Verdict: 8.5/10.",

I liked where they were going with the combat, but it seemed like they didn't go into it any deeper. The animation was solid. It's not very long. It's a meciocre game, overall.",

Platforming was super meh, might as well have been QTE's. Lastly, game is fairly short... took me 4 hours or so for just the SP, no idea about the coop and will probably be some time before I get around to playing it",

Controls work good with Xbox controller, but it could be better. 2. Lot of cutscenes material is missing for no apparent reason.  If you go past that, Shank is really fun action game. Nice graphics, lots of blood and guts, 2D brawler made for modern age. You go right, jump, hack, shout and punch hordes of enemies. There is 20 single player levels for about 4-6 hours of gameplay and 2 player local co-op (2 controllers) for another 3-5 hours. It is a bit short but it is long enough not to become repetitive in a bad way. So I recommend it for a nice and violent weekend.",

However my biggest problem with the game is the story, i dont like how linear the story is, i dont like how it has no real originality and the 'plot twist' if you could call it that at the end, was not surpising, at all, I guessed the plot twist as it happened. while the gameplay to me is okay, thoughout most of the game I'm not sure why Shank is doing what he is doing, i dont know who that lady is in relation to Shank. I just really hate this story because it feels like no effort was put in the story.
