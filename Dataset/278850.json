            "review_text": "You get whay you pay for... and I got this game for free.  The gameplay is a lot worse than it shows off. Now I lot my retro games, I must have spent at least a good $20 every Saturday morning at the local arcade(which was in a bowling alley) so I knew what this game was going to be like. Heck I still have the original luna lander and that game is better than this.  I won't review the graphics or audio because they are both exactly what they show off... pseudo-80's/90's semi-realistic photos that move. No issue with that.  The issue is the fire button is permanently locked to Left-hand mouse and the shields(missiles) to the Right hand button, yet the movement is keyboard based... what the?!!!  And if you press 'ESC' to check the controls or something of the menu... YOU QUIT YOUR GAME!!!! You cannot resume or anything. You'd think they'd give a warning like 'Do you really want to quit?' but nooooo.  Not worth $5 USD. Maybe $1... if it was better by... I don't know... being able to re-assign the keys!  I'm going back to Luna Lander now or maybe some Sopwith Camel. Either is better than this.  P.s. How does this game take up almost 200mbs?!!! Have people just given up on compression?!!",
