I have put countless hours into playing this game and it was all well spent.   All the gameplay is smooth, each class helps out the other when you get to higher difficulties. HOW COULD I FORGET THE BEST PART, THE LOOT SYSTEM, you're always looking for better quality items for your hero, and it's actually a nice grind.  I am not going to make a huge paragraph about this game but all I can say is, it's worth every penny. Buy it.",

            "review_text": "Dungeon Defenders, in the beginning, was very fun. It is definitely a fun game. However, when playing online, there's no fun. It requires an insane amount of hours to actually build up the required amount of armor on a high level character to warrant putting down towers. You become useless the moment you play online. Single player is only fun for a little while, it eventually gets repetitive, and to be honest, impossible. You can not progress in this game by yourself. So unless you have a few dear friends to play local with, I would absolutely not recommend this game.",

            "review_text": "I should love this game. A tower defence game with heavy roleplaying elements, vibrant colours and plenty of different strategies to choose from.  The core gameplay actually really speaks to me too. You control your hero, selected from 4 different types (or more, we'll get into that) and defend the Eternia Crystals using both an assortment of weapons and summoned magical defences. There are wizards that summon elemental towers, knights that summon medieval fortifications and siege weapons, monks that work with auras and hunters that employ traps. All of these feel different and entertaining, and for a first impression this game made a great one. The further you get from this core gameplay though, the bleaker things start to look.  Your hero levels up by defeating enemies and surviving waves (or rather, having the crystal survive waves. Your hero just respawns if he/she dies), and gets a skill point or two to invest into either personal statistics like health or damage or choose to increase similar values on their summoned defences. This means that you have to choose how to balance things between your hero and your defences. Higher levels will also unlock access to better (randomly generated, typical RPG fare) loot, new defences and 2 special skills.  Spare mana from levels, which is there used to summon, repair and upgrade defences, heal the player and use special skills, is given to the player and is then used to buy items from the shop in the tavern (hub level) or upgrade existing items. Both of these take a  ton  of mana, far more than you'll get just by progressing through the game normally. You'll need to grind a lot to afford your first pet, or max out even the shoddy level 1 gloves you're likely to have picked up during the opening level.  Then there are 25 pieces of DLC for this game, total value ~5x times the cost of the base game that add new levels, new costumes and new heroes (some actually new ones but mostly gender-swapped reskins of the original 4 classes). There are three modes of playing this game, locally, online using the Steam system and 'Ranked' using Trendy's own in-house system. Ranked is the only way to earn achievements, and is completely separate from the rest of the game (characters, campaign progress, even camera settings) which pretty much negates all the neat Steam workshop stuff that's out there since everybody is playing Ranked instead.  I first bought and played this game on XBox Live Arcade, which was almost entirely neglected by the development team. Not only did they not get most of the DLC, they were also passed over on actual game updates, including patches and bug fixes. For example, to this day the first Apprentice tower has a hard cap on its firing speed that makes it utterly useless for higher level players.  More recently a semi-sequel came out,  Dungeon Defenders Eternity , which repackaged all of the original content into a shiny new package... and expected people to just buy it again. Worse yet, that game has since been  abandoned  and just half-heartedly (and looking at the community comments, also just incompletely) compensated the disappointed players by giving them a free copy of Dungeon Defenders.  I don't normally bother with things like that in a review, but their business practices really are abysmal, and the game would need to be a hell of a lot better for me to excuse them. So now there's an Early Access sequel in the works, which looks to add even more weird design choices and problems and I'm just done with all of it. Whatever is going wrong at Trendy Entertainment is going  very  wrong and I recommend everybody that will listen to watch it from a safe distance and not buy their games, including this one.  Maybe get  Defender's Quest  instead, since that's also a tower defence rpg hybrid and it's actually good",

After you finish the campaign, the challenges that you unlock are really fun, their like minigames. As a bonus, the ~20+ DLC's for the game make the challenges endless.    Suggestions if you buy the game.    - Play with a friend! - Controller, (  not required but preferred  ) - Start with the character: Apprentice - Have fun!",

(probably not, but it's awesome, really)  You are reading the review of someone who was able to play this game before the modders came and began their work of pure evil. If you don't have the DLCs you get to choose between the Archer, Monk, Apprentice and Squire. The archer-class focuses mainly on traps and, well, physical long-range attacks as she is an archer-class hero. The monk-class is balanced between long- and short-range attacks and can create auras (spheres) that have various effects on the enemies. The apprentice-class is a magic long-range fighter able to build magic towers and one type of blockade. The squire-class is the tank in this game as he has to fight in close-range combat and can summon various weapons that cause physical damage to nearby enemies.  Most of the players tend to choose the 'Monk' because of his balance, but you definitely miss out if you play only one hero-class. You get to know the advantage and disadvantages of every single hero and learn to combine them to master this game.  Enough talk for now, go and hunt some goblins!!!",

            "review_text": "This game was probably the most value for money purchase I have ever made. I have sunk countless hours into this game (I lied.. steam counted 737..) and it has provided me with hours of fun, a great community and a lot of interesting gameplay. The game itself is a 3rd person tower defence game with an rpg element to it. Your hero levels up and gets new items that drop from the monsters you kill. The loot is randomly generated which in itself has a good and a bad side. The good side being BAJILLIONS of armor/weapon variants. The down side is that getting good quality loot and more importantly loot that you need and are looking for is very difficult, especially when you get to the higher rarity armor and weapon types. This can make the game very grindy and if doing levels over and over again, perfecting your layout and gameplan isn't for you then Dungeon Defenders isn't for you, at least not if you want to be the very best like no one ever was..  That being said there are a lot of levels, challenges, maps and various modes to play giving the game enough variety and interesting gameplay to warrent anyone playing it for the price. There are some big flaws with the game. The prime of these boil down to two things; There is a lot of DLC, and I do mean a lot of it, and the game is very easy to hack. Now the DLC aspect of the game isn't too terrible. There is a lot of it but a lot of it is cosmetic and almost all of them are cheap. Now the hacking is an actual problem. The game is very easy to hack and hence hackers are prominent in the community, even in the online play. Trendy tries to monitor and ban hackers but it is a bit out of their control. If you are the kind of person who likes to play by themselves (which you totally can) then this won't affect you at all. If you want to play online with others then I suggest using the forums and getting to know a few people who play the game (or get your friends to play with you). Having people you regularly play with ensures a nicer experience then trying to adapt to pub games and risk having your experience ruined by hackers.   With all this in mind I still feel like Dungeon Defenders was a great purchase and a great experience. I would recommend it to anyone if for nothing else just to play through the story and see the interesting gameplay it provides. This game is old however and the sequal is on its way so perhaps holding off for that may be a better idea if you don't plan on getting into this game hardcore.",

I noticed it's hard to join low level people's games with a high level character. Which is why more people need to play this game for a variety of players. I host games often because of gettiing kicked, and allow all level characters to join most of the time.   Personally, I think modified weapons are great if you want to breeze threw the maps or have a more relazing experience. I would not recommend always playing with these modified weapons, because it takes away from the excitement of this colorful and sometimes challenging game. Challenge games are fun... and well, challenging. I recommend playing on hard once you get the hang of the game, because it's the right amount of difficulty and enemies in my opinion. I love playing on Insane, but I've put a lot of hours in this small addicting game. I play started out playing with keyboard and mouse, but i like to use a controller now. Using a controller is easier once you figure out how to build towers.  I recommend this game, but be careful not to get sucked in and spend a bunch of money. I hear it's very easy to do.",

If you never played Dungeon Defenders before, play this one before Dungeon Defenders Eternity. Dungeon Defenders Eternity disgraces everything about the original. They tried to fix alot of stuff that wasn't broke, and broke a game that was quite good to begin with.  It's true, this had alot of hackers cause it was too easily hacked (dunno WHY people have to ruin such a great game, what is so fun about hacking!? Nothing...), and though Dungeon Defenders Eternity solved the issue of making the game hard to hack, they ended up changing alot of other aspects based on the first Dungeon Defenders which saddens me to the extreme.

            "review_text": "Dungeon Defenders - Your everyday tower defense game.  There is a very big reason why I recommend this game - It is possibly the only game that my wife and I can play together without going at each other throats.  The background (story - if you can even call it that) is quite simple. The heroes go away for blood and glory, leaving the apprentices behind. As any proper apprentice does, they messed up and now hordes of orcs are invading you from every corner to destroy the Eternia Cristals and unleash a new latent evil).  So long story short - you have a cristal and you have to defend it at all cost.  The positives: + Very fluid game + Different Classes with unique traps and tricks + Nice cartoonish characters + Smooth Learning curve + Can be amazingly challenging, depending on how you play it + Nice to play with friends and family  The negatives - Can be repetitive (after 60h of game I am still loving it, but I can understand why people would say that) - Very segmented in DLCs. It is frustrating when you realize that you only have 50% of the game, and the other 50% is in DLCs. - Playing on-line with strangers is not very fun. Strangers dont tend to play as a team and the game becomes more a race to see who plants more of their own traps. Furthermore, higher levels will have no trouble outshining the lower level players.  My personal experience:  I have 2 characters - one in which I have been using to play alone (full single player, without even mixing classes) and other that I use to play with my wife.  My experience as single player - From what I read - and from what I believe it is the way the game was built to be played, when going single - you should use several characters and combine their traps in the most efficient way. Personally speaking, I have found extremely fun and challeging only using one character and its own abilities/traps. And trust me - it is hard, challenging, and sometimes it even seems impossible.  When I am playing with my wife - we often spend time discussing where and when to place traps in the latter maps, and we are already working as a well oiled machine in the maps that we know better. We have been able to evolve characters +\\- at the same time, and it is nice to see that even though we use different classes, we both feel that our roles as individuals and as a team are important to beat the level.   I feel that evolving the characters at a simillar rate has helped improving the fun of the game. If you have a couple of close friends that commit to level their characters at the same pace as you guys, everybody will feel important during game play and everybody will draw the most fun of it.  Just a personal opinion, but this is a game I would definitaly recommend, either if you are playing single or multi with close friends.  ",

            "review_text": "This game holds hours upon hours of playtime and enjoyment.  First off the settings are pretty simple and anyone who plays on a pc will understand them. Thats the boring part out of the way.  So before you get into a game you have to close two chunks of shameless advertising. They want you to buy new characters even though all of them are new because you havn't got into the game yet. There are four free characters you can play which are: Apprentice, Squire, Huntress and Monk. Each of these have different traps such as the Apprentice having a lot of higher damage traps whereas the Squire mainly has blockades. The damage and health of course does depend on your armour, how you level up and whether you forge items to be better.  The character creation is basically what colour you want to be and your name. Pretty lame but the colour isnt as important as the gameplay.  The problem with the game for new players is you would just click 'quick play' so you can jump right in. This will place you in a game with people similar to your level, except for the level 77 who has taken up all the trap space and all you can do is sit and sponge xp. This is the problem. Anyone of any level can join which has a huge effect on the gameplay, sometimes making you quit because you get bored.  However persevering with the game pays off as you start to learn from other people telling you your traps suck and the level up system, that doesnt seem to require any kind of grinding. Basically it is hard to be bad at the game. Its a tower defence game. Place traps in the right place and then shoot the bad guys with your funky weapon that has symbols you have no clue about. If its green its good. That is pretty much the game right there.  I just want to take a second to mention that annoying ingame voice bug. Good luck with push to talk. Most of the people won't be able to hear you if you do.  There are bosses in the game and you usually have to require doing a bunch of stuff like using electric rods of some sort, of course this is unless the level 77 doesn't go super saiyan 3 and one shot the boss. (And yes Sam if you are reading this I havn't watched it yet but I can still refrence it so keep your hair on)  The more you level up the stronger you become. You will be able to complete higher difficulties and get better gear. Along with this you kind of pass the new players and get in with the cool kids. These people suck. Im in games and they all agree to only take what you need. And im looking at items no one wants thinking, 'You are wasting valuable mana here!' (Mana is the currency for traps and the forge system, which is pretty much an average upgrade system) So i wait untill the last five seconds then mash 'E' and hope no ones see's me.  The highest level is 100. Im currently at level 45 or so. This means i can't say what it's like with the tough kids as i'm still only in with the cool kids. But i'm under the impression it is just a bit more serious.  So the game may come off kind of bad here. I didn't exactly say it was perfect because it really isnt, and there isnt going to be a change either. However, the game is very fun. I really enjoy it because i am a big fan of tower defence games and Dungeon Defenders ticks all the boxes and goes further. The maps don't seem to get old and the players all working together makes the game feel more like an RP that other games. Also when you max out your character, you make another one and do that twice more before you have to give them more money. That isn't very good in my opinion as i did pay for the game but i don't mind because the amount of play time in those four characters is more than most tower defence games have in total.  Im sorry if im confusing you or my sentances arn't the best but im very ungood at writing stuff. In conclusion, buy the game. It really is worth the money and with the second game coming out soon it would do you well to get a feel for how the game works so when Dungeon Defenders 2 is released you won't be kicked for being a scrub.",

It can be described as a blend of hack and slash loot collection with tower defense, such as the gift from heaven that was Bloons Tower Defense. In terms of how this blend plays out it allows the player to help out the towers during the attck waves meaning a much more immersive experience than other tower defense games. In tradition with games such as diablo there is also a heavy emphasis on randomized loot that can always be improved. This however can lead to some frustrating encounters as loot may drop with better stats, but have a level requirement of 60, at the start of the game. Gameplay plays out very smoothly with the transitions between the building and defending phases, allowing for a breather between the heavy onslaughts, letting you upgrade and repair your defenses as seen fit. The traditional defend the crystal game mode may start to get stale after doing many a mission but thats brings us to my favorite part of the game, the challenges. The challenges of the dungeon defenders are unque mission that put a twist on the workings of the game by changing how fundemental parts of levels play out. This includes a crystal that teleports around the map, a level in which golbins rain from the sky, one where no towers are allowed, and dozens of others thanks to the large amount of free and paid for content that Dungeon Defenders has recieved post launch. Overall the game is a solid blend of two enjoyable genres that is pleasant romp through many varied environments. I highly reccomend playing with friends as it increases the enjoyment of the game exponentially. The game has taught me that all necromancers are jewish Jay Leno",

Your goal is to defend different crystals in different maps and positions from hordes of enemies, using the building and fighting skills of your character, whose powers increases with the experience they gain while defending, and with the equipments you find scattered around the battlefield. In bigger and harder maps, you may consider getting the support of some friends in order to defend every crystal from the evil, and combining your buildings with different stats or different sets will bring your team to the victory. If you're playing alone, you may consider to try out all of the four characters, and to use all of their buildings togheter, in order to succeed in the game; If you're playing with some friends, coordinate each other and combine the different characters's structures in a proper way to have a chance against the wave.   If you're going to buy this game now, be aware of one thing : there are lots of DLCs that adds more playable characters, maps, a new difficulty, and the final part of the story of this game. This means that,  without buying almost every DLC , you will have only half of the fun from this game, making yourself consider buying the whole Dungeon Defenders Collection.  Also, if you're going to play huge maps with some buddies, your friends may experience big lags, even if they have a good computer which can normally handle very huge games, making their match boring and stressful.  Though this is a magnificent game, you'll need to shell out a lot of money to really enjoy it; also the developers are no longer working on this game (instead they are in the sequel of this, a MOBA genre), so the lag problems and such won't be fixed.

But between all of the characters (we bought them all), the massive amount of loot and the strategy of the tower placement, we have not been bored yet in close to 8 hours of play. And better yet - we've only scratched the surface.  So to those looking for a game to play with the family - I'd give this a definite thumbs up. My kids struggled a bit to grasp some of the concepts in the beginning but once they figured out the strategy of placing the towers and how to evaluate whether the loot was better than what they already had, it was easy. It's been really fun working together.  Quick note for anyone else interested - I am using the mouse/keyboard and my kids are using xbox controllers - definitely working out well.",

The four playable classes are vastly different and all have their ups and downs making this game a must have for parties.The game is possible to win in single player, though easier and much more enjoyable to play multiplayer with your buddies where the roles and the types of defences set up are handled strategically by the whole party. Another great feature of this game is that new content is constantly getting released, some of it free, in fact the whole title seems to be slowly heading in the direction of a somewhat interesting MMO allowing the sale of personalised weapons, armour and pets on the global market. My personal rating for the game is 10/10 ^-^",

Each has their own play style for not just their towers but also their actual fighting. This means you can enjoy a lot of replay value out of it, as you find different ways to beat the various maps on the higher difficulties with different kits.  Additionally, you can swap characters between waves of enemies. So once you grow your character pool, you can solo content on difficulties you would normally want a group for by just setting up defenses as a wider spread of classes.

(Im at 47 hours atm and I'm not even close to being satisfied.) - The graphics are great for a game of such age, not so great that you need a super computer to play though. - (Opinion) The concept is truly amazing, a 3d tower defense were you can help your towers get the job done. - 4 default characters (No dlc), and many more added with dlc. - Trendy Net (The Multiplayer Provider) is still keeping an eye on the community and banning modders. - There is an infinite amount of content to play on steam workshop. - Deeper well on Insane Survival HC mode. &lt;3   Cons: - Some (NOT ALL) of the community is filled with horrible trolls who can ruin hours of your gameplay. - Some grinding is required at higher levels, may result in boredom. - Some characters (Monk) are practically impossible to play solo, you must have a team. - Some bosses are imbalanced. - Dungeon Defenders II is garbage. - The story kinda leaves off on a big cliff hanger. - ^^^ You can't finish the entire story without a DLC. - Some of the (Recommened level) recommendations are extremely incorrect.

I found the gameplay to be great, it has a good story and different classes to experiment with. Again, there are downsides to the classes, first off you can't really customize the characters, you are stuck with the default look and if you don't buy the DLCs you are stuck with only four basic classes.(trust me the DLCs are worth it though). So basically this is a great game with a good plot and characters. If you are into defense/strategy games this is for you.(for the best strategic class I recommend the summoner DLC class.)",

(Thanks to Valve for the new Review Feature)  The Main Goal is to defend a Crystal from Waves of attacking fantasy creatures. You can pick one of several classes like the Apprentice, a Wizard Trainee that can summon Magic Towers to help in defending the Crystal. A Huntress who can lay traps to slow the advancing troops or stop them dead in the tracks and a lot more. It's a bright and colourful mix of 'Tower Defense' and First/Third Person Action RPG'. (You can change from 1st to 3rd person).  The Game has seen a steady support from the developers and offers a near endless amount of items ranging from Swords, Bows, Guns, Rainbow firing ponies and Seahorse Pets to small Goblin Cupids. The Campaign is a lot of fun to play together with friends, I can highly reccomend it to you guys if you're looking for a fun game for your group to play with. It's easy to get into and soon you'll be spending hundreds of hours (just like me) finding the perfect strategy and build for your character for each and every map of the Game. There's also tons of side-missions that cruelly twist the Objective to bring in some extra difficulty. How about defending a Portal that teleports around the map? Or how about trying to defend a Portal in a Town that is slowly being flooded while you have to solve riddles to lower the water levels ? All that and much more is waiting in this game.  This pretty much sums it up so far, again, I can highly reccomend this game. It's extremely addicting, has a cute graphic style, an amazing soundtrack and lots of replayability... and the added Steam Workshop feature only adds to the latter!  Give it a go! 5/5 from me",

The minimap must be invoked through some hot key and isn't displayed by default. And as some other reviews mentioned, the graphics is way too colourful and well, it might be suited for some kids but it just makes me dizzy.

Logistics dilute the fun of multiplayer in other RPGs, in my opinion: we're out exploring some hinterland and one of us runs off after this chest or the other gets attacked by some monster, and we have to keep backtracking to each other instead of adventuring . Really, it's just that there isn't much incentive to cooperate in such cases and the incentive to be spontaneous and follow your own interest remains. Or perhaps I'm just RPG-self-centered or something, but the point is it's not a problem in DD here, where you're stuck together and benefit from talking and figuring out how to use each other's resources to take the next step you take couldn't alone.  There is more skill and nuance than I would have thought in beating the succesive challenges, and it has remained fun for 200 on and off gameplay hours. The singular, all-useful character resource of mana is well implemented, in my opinion: a well balanced gameplay system is always a joy, but when you like one which is also simple and straightforward, it's impresive. There are many things to achieve and a lot of them are quite accessible, and finally I like that I can build up multiple characters and swap them in and out on challenging map set ups. Like mutually beneficial cooperation between players, mutually beneficial cooperation between my individual characters is pretty neat.",

Cons -Can be grind-heavy and time-consuming in later stages. Farming for mana can also be slow at times. -Not very fun to play on your own. -If you don't like Borderlands-style loot, you may find the constant sorting and swapping annoying.   One of the most fun 4-player splitscreen (if you have a dongle and four gamepads) co-op games out there. Big emphasis on teamwork and learning which classes, towers, and abilities work well together. Fun visual style and colour scheme, and a big variety in weapons and enemies.  It can get pretty grinding in the later stages; the difficulty jump between Insane and (with the DLC) NIghtmare is absolutely ridiculous, but everybody aside from the most hardcore players will find plenty to do on Easy though Insane. I almost never play on my own, but this is the go-to game for me and my roommates when we want to play splitcreen. Online co-op is fun as well.   Highly recommended.  ",

Pros: - Building or character focused - Pets... lots of them! - Costumes - Different events or themes as well as maps that go with them - Lots of maps and difficulty - Progression is easy if you're patient. Meaning don't think you run 3 insane Endless Spire and think you should get top gear already. - Different challenges - Tons of achievements - Lobby to show off and brag about your loot or act as a hub to interactive with each other.  Cons: - Takes time to learn maps - Takes time to progress like getting gear and such - Some Beggers/Looters/AFKers/Leeches  Theres more pros and cons(mostly pros) but I can't remember them all.

The towers themselves are so overpowered that you can just put a few on the spawn points and shut down the monsters completly. Where the game excels at is the loot and RPG portion. The loot modifications are random the weapons are ridiculously awesome looking so you can level up and customize your character however you want to play them.   PROS -Awesome looking weapons and loot. -Sylish games -Tons of cool maps and challenges.  CONS -Not a fan of the tower cap -Monsters hardly travel on maps -Some random bugs and crashes   Rating: 7.9/10",

            "review_text": "Dungeon Defenders is really cool and intense! When I first saw the game on Steam, I thought 'Naaa this game looks so boring' but when I looked at achievements and watched a bit of gameplay on YouTube, I wanted this game. When I played it first time it was pretty fun, now I really like this game, it's so much fun and it offers a huge challenge until you heroes reached a very high level! It's start off slowly but it get's better when you get your character(s)to a high level! To complete the levels on a certain difficulty, you need to have a high enough level to do it, unless someone joins your game or you join there game. It's kind of annoying when some players kick you out for no reason(Like when you just joined the session) unless your character is a low level character but you get some nice players that will actually help you level up your character. To make the game more fun, you have to try get all the DLC's! It's best to get them when they on special. The first DLC that great to start off is the Lost Eternia Shards. You get some new levels and unlocked the Nightmare Difficulty and you can play any level on Nightmare! It's crazy how much XP your characters have to earn after reaching level 70. From level 1 to 70, you have to earn about 3,000,000XP to get to level 70! Level 70 to 100, over 1.1 BILLION XP just to get to level 100. That's crazy!!! The amount of damage you do is so little and then you do huge amount after that! This game isn't about just using your characters to kill monsters, you also have to build defenses and avoid the enemies from the destroying the Eternia Crystal! Otherwise when the Eternia Crystal get's destroyed it's game over and you have to start the level over(Obviously!) At first, the monsters have a bit of health and in other levels like in the DLC, the enemies have HUGE amount of health, especially in Nightmare! You get a Meag Turkey Boss tha has over 350,000,000 HP!!! That's just INSANE!!! This game can surely be challenging but really fun! Once you get all your characters to level 100 and you got all the achievements, then there isn't really anything to do after that, you've completed the whole when you've done that! Once you reached Level 100 you can't earn more XP which kinds of sucks! You get survival as well in all levels and you get Pure Strategy where you can only build defenses, your characters can't attack! It least the monsters can't attack you as well  8/10  I actually don't have most of the DLC's for this game, but the reason I said a Mega Turkey has over 350,000,000 HP, I've played the level called Tarven Defense on someone else's game so I know a bit of some DLC levels.",

            "review_text": " Dungeon Defenders  is a unique tower defence based action RPG, with colorful yet cartoony artstyle. Your goal is to protect one or more Eternia Crystals from being smashed by Goblins and Orcs. You can do so by placing different turrets and walls to keep them off. Of course you can as well take your sharpest sword or strongest bow and hop in the combat yourself.   Dungeon Defenders   co-op mode  supports up to 4 players, and is highly recommended to play with other players, although you can still progress playing by yourself. You will be gaining experience while completing levels, what let's you level up. Doing so gives you skill points, what let's you specify your own gamestyle. Whether you wanna go for your own HP or maybe damage of your defences.  The game is somewhat of an DLC-fest, and I personally would highly recommend getting the complete pack when getting the game. As the DLC's triple the available characters and add tons of replay value by adding much greater level cap and whole new game difficulty, being much harder than the previous ones. (of course leading to much better loot.) Not forgetting some totally new maps with completely new weapons and pets.  However the game isn't just only protecting the crystals. There is some special challenges, one for example being you jumping into Orcs boots and now trying to break the Eternia Crystals instead. There is also some maps only made for some good ol' PvP. (some maps like these support more than 4 players.)  I personally have had a blast playing this with different friends over and over again. I highly recommend considering the DLC's if you are otherwise interested of the game.  Pros:  The game is a lootfest.   Tons of fun with friends.   It's really hard to run out of something to do.   You can definitely spend more than 300 hours on this.   Cons:  Game could get a bit hard playing alone at some points.  ",

After wasting countless hours and money on the game, you may have reached some progress - But by free riding in other high-level players games you can save hundreds of hours of grinding - Which is kind off all the game provides - Either free riding or grinding - Of which none are very satisfying.  Furthermore the game seems to have a big hacker-problem.  In short, do yourself a favor and don't buy this money- and time consuming game - I promise, it will bring no good to your life.  ",

            "review_text": "So Doungeon Defenders. It a towwer defence game mixed with a Horde mode RPG kind of a game.  Gameplay: So this game has 12 classes (8 of them are DLC heros) Each has diffrent defences they can place on the map each defence cost DU (Defence Units) and you have a DU limit for each map and each hero has 2 abilleties. As any RPG creatures drop gear with sats on them, There are 4 types of stats, Hero stats, Tower stats, Abillety stats and Armor stats. The goal is to defend the Crystal or Crystals on the map so if the crystals HP reach 0 the game is over and you win by defeating all the waves of enemys.  Game Modes: There are the campain mode (as explained above) Survuval mode, the same thing but you have to servive 25 waves and each wave is alot harder then campagin. Challenge Mode, This can be pretty much anything and there are tons of diffrent challenges. The difficulties are Easy, Medium, Hard, Insane and Nightmare. Easy, Medium and Hard are pretty much easy so I recommend you start with these and pick the difficulty you think you can handel. Insane has s difficulty spike compared to hard it is best to gear up before you try insane. Nightmare also has a difficulty spike and this time even worse then insane You need the best of the best insane gear to advance to nightmare but sadly enouth this difficulty is a DLC option so you have to buy the DLC.  DLC: So on to the DLC and there is alot of it. The Hero DLCs are as follows. New Hero Pack. These heros are just the other gender of the original heros the only diffrence is the Hero abilletys Next we have Barbarian. This hero is a pure fighter so he has no defences he can place on the feild he instead has alot of extra Hero Abilletys. Next we have Summoner. This hero is abit special it can't fight bt itself it instead place out minions. Even that these minions are defences they do not cost DU they instead cost MU (Minion Units) The MU on a map will always be the same as DU and yes it means you can place both minions and defences at the same time effectivly dubbleing the amount of defences on the map. Next we have EV Series. This hero is a shield and beam expert. She can build the widest shields to stop enemys from fluding in the wider the beam or shield the more DU it will cost. The beams are stun, boost and laser but the most useful is the boost beam as the beam only have to touch another defence and it will boost it's stats.  Map DLC: There are tons of maps I personaly recommend them all they make for a fun varied game. And if you play with friends only one person need to own the map DLC for the other to play it but only as long that person hosts the game.  Steam Workshop: If the games maps are not enouth for you this game has the Workshop with additional maps But I warn you thou it is very hit and miss and I have not even played close to all of them and the ones I hgav played are probebly updated since I played them  Summery and own thoughts: This game is best played with friends but I warn you right now this game can easly become a time vampire but even so I recommend it. Buy the DLC atleast the map ones as there are not enouth maps in the base game if you ask me. Other then that only but the DLC you think you will use. If you pick up this game ready your defences and arms for waves apon waves of enemys",

However, my own time with this game has shown it to be underwhelming. Allow me to explain my bias.  Dungeon Defenders does well in blending the tower defense and third person action genres. As one of four different classes (more if you've purchased the DLCs), you'll be fending off waves of enemies through a multitude of well designed and colorful levels.  The biggest issue I've noticed is the class imbalance. Some classes will have skills that can easily diminish hordes of enemies. Other classes, even at a higher level, will find enemies resistant to their abilities. Secondly, the combat just isn't engaging. Not only is it a bore repeatedly hitting the attack button, but it's also a bore to watch.  For the majority of its audience, Dungeon Defenders boasts great replay value. For those looking for more excitement, try elsewhere.  Grade: C+",

Despite being co-op, the maps don't have enough area for 4 players to farm equally. Sanctum is so much better in this respect. Things are not balanced, and DLC tends to add more junk while making the normal items scale down in quality. Yep, they can nerf your loot on your character.

            "review_text": "Dungeon Defenders. While the name may be remniscent of the classic tabletop fantasy RPG many of us know and love, Dungeon Defenders offers an entirely different world and a completely unique game experience.  A hybrid between tower defense and action RPG, Dungeon Defenders places you in the role of one of four young warriors left home alone while the Heroes of the Realm are away in battle. When a mishap threatens to unleash the diabolical Old Ones from their imprisonment within the Eternia Crystals, however, it's up to you to devend the Eternia Crystals and save the world from a new age of darkness!  The gameplay of Dungeon Defenders is deceptively simple: find choke points you can use to defend the Eternia Crystals, build your towers in the Build Phase, and fight alongside and manage those towers during the Combat Phase. But the simplicity of this system belies its incredible depth. The real strategy of the game comes from upgrading your characters and equipment, allowing you to tackle increasingly-difficult challenges and difficulty levels, all the way up to the dreaded Nightmare Hardcore mode.  While the content included in the base game is great, it pales in comparison to the array of incredible DLC available for the game. The opposite-gendered Heroes offer speed boosts and different abilities compared to the original four, the Barbarian allows for incredible DPS-oriented gameplay, the Series EV offers a number of variable-cost beams to buff and protect your towers, the Summoner brings forth minions and can even transform his play experience into a full-time RTS, and the Jester can move towers, run and upgrade speedily, deal incredible damage, and (with luck) control the battlefield with her Wheel of Fortuna skill, a true jack of all trades. Each of these heroes comes with their own map that highlights their skills while offering new and innovative gameplay mechanics. However, the ultimate challenge comes in the Quest for the Lost Eternia Shards DLC, which not only includes an entirely new campaign with even more difficult enemies, but also unlocks the aforementioned Nightmare and Hardcore options for all of the game's levels.  Still not enough for you? Each level, once completed, offers Pure Strategy and Survival modes, where you can pit your tower-building skills against increasingly-difficult waves of enemies for increasingly powerful rewards, as well as a number of special Challenges that range from holiday celebrations to complete inversions of the core gameplay experience. There are literally hundreds of hours of content available in Dungeon Defenders, and the experience is worth every one of them.  The game does have its problems. The menus can be rather clunky, the Eternia Shards maps are an incredible difficulty spike from the campaign levels even on the easier difficulties, and the loot dropping mechanics are a little obtuse. Additionally, while they don't overshadow the original characters, the DLC hero classes tend to be a requirement rather than an option on some of the more difficult maps, and the DLC map packs tend to drop better reward loot than the originals. Still, the problems don't really get in the way of the fun, and the developers at Trendy Entertainment are always responsive to feedback.  On that note, I'd like to point out that Trendy Entertainment (the people who make the game) are incredibly open and helpful, and always willing to help people out in a pinch. These are some of the most hardworking game developers I've seen, and they engage with the Dungeon Defenders community on an almost unprecedented level--even rivaling Mojang of Minecraft fame. If you haven't done so yet, be sure to visit the Dungeon Defenders forums, which, in addition to offering numerous helpful guides and trading opportunities for the game, also serve as home to the Trendy blog, which provides and open window into the development of Dungeon Defenders, as well as into their current developments of Dungeon Defenders' upcoming sequel. This is a studio incredibly devoted to their art, and they have a bright future ahead of them. :)",

If you are a fan of grinds (as I am in many situations) it should be a good fit for you.   Even if you don't enjoy a grind-style endgame, you can still get many hours of enjoyment out of Dungeon Defenders, though. There are plenty of maps and characters to master, and if you don't feel the need to increase the difficulty level beyond what you're comfortable with, you won't be forced to.  If you can pick it up in a pack with all the DLC it is even better, as there are some genuinely interesting DLC classes and game modes.",

I personally love the art style and gameplay strategy, and how it gives you a choice on what you can do.  Imagine it sort of like Castle Defense. Monsters come in, you need towers to take them out, but you are also able to attack the monsters yourself. However, monsters will attack your towers, and you if you get in their way. The best way to win is to work with others (agreeing with them on tower positions, repairing their defenses, etc), and to always think out your strategy before going in guns blazing (even at that, you'll still probably die if you think you can take them all on your own).  However, one issue is that there is a lot of DLC. If you want some additional content, either have your wallet ready or buy the new Dungeon Defenders game (however, that game cannot be played without an internet connection). But if you only want four playable characters and around twenty levels and challenges (each), this should be for you.  Another thing is that some online players (mostly newer ones) don't plan their strategy first and immediately want to get to killing. This can be a problem, since they steal the mana (what you use for abilities, towers, defenses, healing, etc) and start the wave before I can do anything. It's always good to talk to your team first before you do anything. Arguing over defense units (your limit of defenses) can be common, but usually it can be resolved.  Overall: It's a great and fun game.",

Although you may play alone, it seems that this game was definitely made to be played cooperatively with another people, as the combination of skills for each class plays and important role throughout the matches (of course, there's also the PVP option but I never really cared for it). It also seems that the sky is the limit when it comes to purchasing and upgrading new weapons as there's always something new available to afford. I'd say that the story mode is somewhat short and there's also a lot of grinding involved, but overall games like these are very similar when it comes to that.
