            "review_text": "Think Civilization (or Master of Orion, if you're familiar with that) except instead of playing a civilization, you play an independent demi-god that gets to freely meddle in and shape everyone's affairs. And while the writing is very funny and the soundtrack is lovely, some design decisions turn the game part of this into a bit of a farce.   You have way too much power over the entire simulated world. Pretty much every variable is directly and easily changed by a metaphorical snap of your fingers and a selection on a menu. You can make anyone like or dislike anyone else. You can quickly ravage anyone's homeworld by messing with their 4 economic indicators and there's nothing they can do about that. Alternatively, you can quickly turn them into an obscene super power, and they cannot do that on their own. Owing to the fact you're completely and instantly healed at the end of every battle, which you can escape from anytime you like, you can destroy virtually infinite numbers of ships, if you but have the patience. You can be delayed, but never stopped. Nothing in the game will ever challenge you; nothing *can* challenge you when you are given this much control over everything. Higher difficulty settings only cause things to take longer; they don't make you any less likely to succeed. The irony here is that beneath the dozens of daunting menus and hardcore aesthetic, what you have is an ultra casual game. And that's what ultimately makes The Last Federation pointless to play.",

        {
            "review_text": "How do I explain this? Bullet Hell meets Civilizations in Space?  You have 8 races, all with very identifiably anatomies ranging from small furry barn-owls to Metroid style Chozo-esque utopian robots to a planet of robots who act like Bender from Futurama to a warlike crab? people (what the hell is a Burlust). The main game mode has you trying to make a unified Federation to stop genocides like the one that happened to your awesome 4 headed dragon race. You can research technology on you rown or with other races to improve your relations with them, help build structures on planets that can either strengthen defenses, help production/livelihood, or just make a bunch of TV channels that help different races learn that they're not supposed to hate everyone.  All this is done through an interface that shows some incredible artwork of each planet and an entire solar system, and text-based explanations that are written as the actual dialogue of your snarky, spunky female ship AI, whom I may add is a fully fleshed-out character who will actively react to the events that occur in-game (she does NOT like when computer virus diseases pop up. Also she can be legitimately surprised if you can pull off things like getting the Peltians to successfully conquer a planet).  And in-combat you have a pretty well rounded bullet-hell style 2D shoot'emup complete with special abilities that can help kill enemies, keep you alive, and help circumvent the power management. Oh, did I forget to mention your ship acts like the old Star Wars TIE Fighter game where you divert finite power between weapons, shields, and engines?  The achievments in this game are a sort of guide to playing. Sure, you *could* just win by completely destroying all races except the ones who are easy to get into a Federation, but some require some finesse (and multiple saves to be honest) like trying to get a Federation of only the Acutians, Burlust, and Thoraxians for the 'Look Upon Your Creation And Despair' achievement when the fastest way is to....make a Federation of Acutians-Burlust-Boarines, then find a way to get the Thoraxians IN and the Boarines OUT.  And yes, you will end up loving some races and hating others. The hiveminded bug people are going to grate at your nerves as you fly to their planet every few minutes to let them know the hard way they're not allowed to have a military just so you can be absolutely sure they don't end up ruining your attempts at a clean, genocide-free Federation where nobody has to play planet hop-scotch and move their entire remaining race.  To top things off the DLC adds new scenarios, one in which you actually have your own faction and one where the Federation exists and you need to keep it from being taken over by a 9th race of Touhou-style bullet-hell ship-piloting bacteria. You have to stop everyone from fighting each other to have a chance against these things and as the Burlust, Acutians, Thoraxians, and Boarines will have taught you well enough, fighting is something a lot of people like doing, no matter how much you hate it.  The game never seems to drag on too long like the inevitable Civ comparison in the long-running marathon games and never seems too short like Civ games that barely hit the iron age before victory (of course the game can be cut short by you dying but that can be said about a lot of games). You can use the standard galaxy or give everyone dice rolls and just hope the people you hate end up starting out on a planet that's ill-suited to them so they don't explode in population.  The soundtrack fits the game *perfectly*, with each track set to each scenario (trade ship raids, resistance fighter smuggling, invading, defending, etc.) all culminating in an ending song that makes it well worth the trouble those Thoraxians give you DID I MENTION I HATE THE THORAXIANS?  Last, I leave you with an excerpt from one of my games: I was attempting to get the achievement for having the three peaceful races in the Federation and nobody else. I focused ENTIRELY on building up their research, technology, defenses, etc. until their planets were fully equipped with everything they could ever want or need. I just ignored the other 5 races and let them go kill each other for a while. Until....until I saw a small little skull icon with a red outline across the other planets in the system. Turns out when you let one race conquer 4 planets they form a nigh-unkillable Fear Empire. This Thoraxian-created Fear Empire literally could NOT be defeated unless I conquered EVERY planet they owned and on their last planet I had to exterminate over a hundred BILLION bug-people. I had three races completely blot out the sun with their fully upgraded warships, I bombed every single building they ever made into dust, I poisoned their environment so much literally nothing could live on their planet, I undermined their economy so they could never even think of building a single spaceship, I poisoned the population until disease was so rampant babies were born on their deathbed and that only took out about *half* of their population. After just hitting the Orbital Bomb dispatch and setting the game to extreme-speed for about 20 minutes I FINALLY killed every single one of these 100+ billion bugs amd wiped them from the galaxy, which allowed me to finally establish my peaceful Federation of pacifists.",

Reminded me a little of a way-scaled-down Distand Worlds, but with a turn-based, tactical bullet-hell twist.  The diplomacy was interesting. Each race ran a different form of government, each having their own nuances you had to abide by to get things done. I found it cleverly crafted, and will play again, soon.  Replay-wise, it seems like it could do with more widescale star system generation (more planets, game modes, scenarios...), but it was an enjoyable and worthwhile experience, nonetheless.",

Here, you play the power behind the curtains manipulating the other races for their own good (a little bit like a 'god' game). Also, the DLC allows for some more conventional game play. Initially, the map seems small compared to other space games, but in reality the 8 races are hard enough to juggle as it is.  There are some drawbacks: small font size makes it barely playable on a laptop if you have bad eyesight, you can't break a 'Fear Empire', and the races/map isn't random, which reduces replay value - a DLC or v2 of the game may fix this?",

For those who aren't fans of deep political games you can still find solace in the excellent battle system, turn based shmup works suprisingly well. If you do like political simulators there is one excellent feature to be found here, observer mode, in observer mode all you do is observe, this sound boring but is actually suprisingly fun to see a solar system develop.

With random elements and a political system being meshed with a premice that to me is interesting. I also had fun with the colorful turn based shooter combat which I found to be a neat twist on standard 2d shooters. However this game does have issues the formost being that the political system is is basicly tweaking numbers. That being said I felt very immersed with all the different ways to manipulate races and why it was manipulating them in that way. For me a added bonus was a very good tutorial gradually introducing me to all the mechanics of the game. I also never felt overly cluttered or lacking in information as everything is displayed as clean and simple graphs allowing me to absorb at a glance the state of affairs. All in all for me at least this game excellent and I will be playing a great deal more in the foreseeable futer.",

I think this is an awesome dev, and I think I love what they are trying to do, but in practice its just not my cup of tea.
