    "description": "For the first time in over 20 years, we are heralding the return of a much loved piece of gaming history with the classic RPG, Wasteland! Mutants. Again. Even more than there were last time: they seem to materialize out of the very grains of the radioactive desert sand. Venomous yellow eyes.",

            "review_text": "So here I am - heading back home on a bus from school, early 1989. The only real thing on my mind? Firing up the Commodore 64 and rejoining the bunch of Desert Rangers that have just escaped from their first encounter with the Scorpitron. Clips of various calibres were burnt through, LAW rockets fired, two mortally injured - but the team survived. Just.  How had this game got to captivate me so much? To this day, Wasteland ranks as my No.1 game of all time. Not a maybe, not a floating possibility amongst five other great games - but the clear front runner and sole contender. One that I doubt will ever be usurped in the immediate and all-consuming effect that wandering into the radioactive barrens of the American mid-West had on me.  Wasteland is a top-down RPG that follows the 'good guys' of Desert Rangers - attempting to put right the wrongs and work out what strange events are happening in post-nuclear desert around Las Vegas. Fully customisable characters are still fun today, but in late 1988, this was unheard of. Brawlers, pistoleros, ranged specialists to hi-tech geeks were all here - including murderous cyborgs, dodgy gamblers, bar owners and lethal, radioactive vermin. Wasteland introduced the options of restraint, or over-kill - depending on your mood and temperament. Do you carefully take a single shot at your target? Or burst fire of a trio of bullets? Or to hell with accuracy and lead count and simply rip through a magazine? Your ammo, your choice.  A newcomer to Wasteland in 2014 will be woefully unimpressed. What's all the fuss about? It looks archaic has virtually no sound and the main storyline can be completed in a very short time span. But a quarter of a century ago, this game shattered the adventure genre apart and set a whole new level of benchmark. The highly influenced offspring of the Fallout games show plenty of direct lineage back to the original game. But none enthrall in quite the same way that Wasteland did.  Even Steam refers to Wasteland 1 as 'The Original Classic'. For those lucky enough to have been around on its first release - that phrase sums it up perfectly.  10 out of 10.",

            "review_text": "Review: So here I am playing a RPG Text-Adventure game from 1988 (I guess I should mention that I have not yet played too many CRPGs) - and well, i knew games from back then were rather complicated compared to the newer games and it happens that you get stuck and dont really know what to do to go on. But surprisingly it only took me a while (okay to be honest i watched a gameplay video or two :p ) to get into the game mechanics and I started to really enjoy the game. The game plays pretty well and compared to the original DOS version the steam version has nicer Aesthethics like redone artworks (sadly not animated like in the DOS version tho) and Built-In game documentary (that even gets read to you). From the Game mechanics side, I did not experience any Bugs, only some difficulties (my party missed alot in the beginning and there are places where the direction that you use your Skills in matters where - in my opinion - it shouldnt. Also when the mayority of your party is unconcious you end up in a never ending cycle of a fight until you eventually die). The game Dynamics went pretty smoothly aswell but you kind of have to know what skills you need have in the beginning whn creating your own characters.  So here are my personal Pros and Cons about the game:  Pros: + What the game lacks in graphics it makes up in Storytelling and Gameplay  + Alot of fun and addicting gameplay  + For the read-lazy people: The Game-Documentary has voiceovers (but then again: Is a game like this for read-lazy people at all? Either way I like how they did the Voiceovers :3)  + Its the Grandfather of all Post-Apocalyptic RPGs... i mean that should be reason enough to play it!  + Good Humor  Neutral: - Needs some getting used to but honestly you cant really blame the game for it  - You get pretty much thrown into cold water at the beginning and have a hard time figuring out where to go but hey cant go wrong with the nearest visible town, right? (Cold start is kind of like in Skyrim to give you some example to compare to... Good for emergent gameplay and I like that but I would just like to atleast get to know a bit of background knowledge PRO-TIP: The documentary gives you some hints about what is going on)  Cons: - Small tileset because they wanted to save up on disk-space back when the game was created... i was told it fitted onto 2 Floppys (why do bunnies look the same as opossums tho ;w; &lt;- and yes these are enemies, and no they dont want to be cuddled, trust me i tried and died)  - Like I mentioned in my Review above there are parts where you can get stuck if you dont know some things (simple things mostly but you really need to know them)  Tips and Hints:  &gt;Try to get a high IQ-stat when creating your character and skill them wisely (the highest of any stat is 18) for example the Perception skill lets you 'see' things that you cant see directly... &gt;Your CON (Constitution/Hit-Points) regenerates over time. You should search for safe places to 'rest'. Time passes  when you do any Action: this includes Moving, 'View' whatever that does, holding down ESC. &gt;Dont get frustrated when you get stuck... it happens occasionally. Try to search the web and/or try things out.",

            "review_text": "Well. Where do i start.... Yes. It is old. The controls are funky and complicated. The game is difficult. BUT:  THIS GAME was the game that came before Fallout. And its better, at least storywise. And whats even better: The original developers of Wasteland 1 and Fallout 1+2 are currently working on Wasteland 2.&lt; So, if you wanna see what started it all, and play a game with insane humor and great story, try this. It's a steal, and will get you into the mood for Wasteland 2, which will be released early 2014.",

Ok, maybe not so much on the last one, but Wasteland is THE game that spawned Fallout, i.e. both created by Mr Brian Fargo. Wasteland is a must-have for any gamer who enjoys Fallout or retro classics in general. BTW, the music in this version is a later add-on, and is the same music used for Fallout 1 and 2, and includes some western-themed music that has a guitar track that goes like this: 'perrrr..........per-doo-per-per-perreeerrerrrerrrerrr' Fair warning, this guitar sound in this game (and in fallout) will get in your head late at night or any time you have an Old West Showdown, which for me is about monthly.  Now port this to android and then I will REALLY poop my pants with glee.  ",

Sure, I can see that, but fallout is a type of game that takes a genre and defines it. This game just happened to be first. Sometimes being first to the genre doesn't mean you're the best...   In 2014, however this game is literally a joke. It can't be played easily, crashes a lot, and the story is about as bad as you can imagine, but hey it was the 80s, and the 80s sucked. This is no exception. You get the same rehashed descriptions on most things, strange technicolor graphics, confusing UI, no AI, this game should have been designated KIA and never revived. Do not buy this game, do not waste your money as it comes in Wasteland 2 for free... and that's even a raw deal because WL2 is buggy with a strange UI and a lot of text. It's basically a novel on strings.   Now let the wasteland fanboys down vote this so they can sleep at night, despite even them knowing this game sucks.",
