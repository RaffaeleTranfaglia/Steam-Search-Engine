            "review_text": "TL;DR: You are getting one of the best strategy games of all time for $15 or less, when the normal board game version costs $40, and takes much longer to play than the digital version. If you like history even a little bit, or strategy games at all, I would highly recommend this game.   Twilight Struggle is an incredible game where every move feels like it could be your last, every mistake is paid for dearly, and every minor victory feels so, so rewarding. This game features a 1v1 tactical deathmatch between the US and USSR during the Cold War, and each side tries to best the other by spreading their influence throughout the world. Play is mostly card based, and each player must decide which cards to play each turn to destroy their opponent: but not all cards are helpful to you, and the threat of global nuclear warfare constantly looms over you. This is probably the most intense and fun strategy game I have played, and seeing it finally brought to Steam is a blessing.  PROS: - One of the best startegy games ever - I find the interface to be fairly good, save for a few hiccups - There is a pretty good tutorial for any newcomers - You can play online multiplayer or offline against an AI - The game gives you several options for modifying the base game, if that's your style - Atmoshpere, music, etc. is the best I could possibly imagine it to be for a Cold War strategy game like this - Tons of historical references for any history nerds out there - Considering the physical board game version of this is usually more than $40, and THAT price is worth it, $15 is pretty damn cheap - Taking over the world and nuclear warfare are ALWAYS fun  CONS: - This game has a pretty big learning curve, in my opinion. The tutorial is good, but you may have to play several games before you get the hang of things - I have noticed several minor glitches, usually when trying to get past a certain screen or when trying to click something, but I have found none of these to be game-ruining - May have to nag your friends to buy a copy if you want to play with someone you actually know - The AI takes a bit of time to make moves  NEUTRAL: - Not sure if I just suck, but the AI seems to be pretty brutally difficult. Some people may like this, others not - This game does involve chance: picking up cards and rolling dice. Some people may like this in strategy games, other people might not   Overall, I would definitely recommend this game. 10/10 board game, 10/10 strategy game, 7/10 video game. You will have a lot of fun spreading freedom as Murica, and a lot of fun killing capitalist pig-dogs as the commies. I think the asking price isn't bad, and I would definitiely pick this game up on sale.  (Editted to fix spelling errors)",

            "review_text": "What to write as my first review and about this wonderful game. Let us begin by saying that this whopping game is awesome. Not just oh look at the graphics or the gameplay or what not, it doesn't hold a candle there. It's a board game it will not win in animations because it does nto really have them. What it does offer is an amazing experience. You will fight your oppponent over countries ♥♥♥ for tat hoping for a better roll and you will smile while holding a hand full of your opponents cards. But only when you know the game. Before that it will seem dull, random and hard. People who know the game will destroy you in it. These are just things that happen.   Yet the game still feels amazing, my reported hours are low but that's just this version. The physical game has seen well over 50 plays. Some of which ended by the second turn and some which have lasted all 10. Even after all that time I still find new ways to use the cards and new ways to screw over your opponent. This version in particular makes it easier to get more plays in. The overall ui is serviceable I would say. It does its job and considering it will eventually make a mobile crossover the design choices made are understandeable. The AI is learning appparently and will get better but it will probably never beat a human opponent once you know how to play. It does a lot of mistakes (like not couping Iraq in AR1) so don't expect it to be challenging once you know the gist of what you are doing. Once you play humans though it's where it shines.   the tension of most turns is beautiful and gut wrenching. You play a card and hope they don't play another. You hope they play a card that has your event. It is the most wonderful aspect of the game and is the hallmark of brilliance. Overall I would say this is an awesome game and a good version of it to boot. It deserves all the praise it gets being #1 on BGG for over 10 years. Play it fall in love and lose yourself to it forevermore.",

AI gives a good game, but after learning the how to play via it beating on me, I started finding opponents online with Playdek and have not looked back. Never have had a problem getting a game, have not had any server problems. I was wary of getting involved in online play -- I hate hate hate things like Rock Star Social Club -- but it is painless and simple.  I had always questioned this game's number one rating on board game geek, but now I am a believer. It wraps up a lot of fascinating history into a quick and easy flowing game that still forces you to dig deep when trying to make the right call on what card to play next. Hats off to the deisgners, this is an incredible game. Favorite game play moment so far: It's looking like a Soviet coup in Panama will send the Northeast of South America tumbing like dominoes, but shoring up Panama means we won't get a shot at moving into Thailand, which probably means kissing most of SE Asia goodbye. What to do?!?!?",

Installed and only played one offline game as of yet, so these are very early comments.   I tried offline first so I could be up to speed with how play works and not take ages when facing human opposition. The interface looks nice and animations are cool enough, although the music got a little repetitive after only a few turns. One serious problem I noticed - don't know if this is just my machine? - is that when playing full screen the cursor does NOT line up with the board! Hence I had to click east Germany to place in Poland and some buttons weren't clickable at all! I hope this is either just me or there is a quick update/fix if not as playing in a window isn't much fun and requires a lot more zooming.  I wouldn't recommend any serious player gets this to face the AI! Hopefully it will learn and adapt as promised, however it headlined Indo-Pakistani war in round 1 and let me win by taking control of Europe by round 3... Including not challenging when I played ops into Italy and letting me take West Germany over 3 turns after playing Blockade!   Overall though, excited for this to develop and start playing people online in an easier format than Vassal. The long wait is over!  ",

There are several UI features that help you understand how the game works, and you have the option of taking back moves as long as the move didn't include a decision by your opponent or a dice roll (ie it doesn't let you cheat), and it has you confirm your moves. The learning curve for the game itself is moderate, but for the strategy it's pretty high, but you will still have fun losing.   The game log tells you everything that has happened, but there are some minor issues where you play a card that give your opponent some influence to place, and if you weren't paying attention you may not know because the gamelog won't tell you until after you end your turn.   There are some very minor bugs where the influence markers don't populate on the board right away, or the AI might 'hang' while making a decision, but moving the map usually fixes it for some reason. My only other complaints are that some of the UI and HUD are difficult to access or see because of other parts overlapping, and the AI feels like it takes an eternity to play sometimes. This is rarely a problem, though, because I'm thinking out my next move. So far I haven't encountered anything that breaks or diminishes the game. The AI is pretty damn good, and overall its a slick looking game and a fantastic adaptation. I can't wait for it to come out on Android in the near future.",

Biggest plus: it is hard to find any other game that fits this niche. It takes you through the intrigue spanning the entire Cold War. Finding a game that involves either real or fictitious Cold War combat is easy enough, but not one with a focus on bringing your side through the Cold War alive, but preferably on top.   Biggest weakness: some balance points are really odd. For example, whomever plays the card that leads to Defcon automatically loses the game. Not only does this not make sense from the perspective of nuclear war directly being proposed from the side that was ahead, when they were ahead, but it also leads to some odd situations where if you play cards like'Olympic Games,' if your opponent boycotts the Olympics at Defcon 2, you lose, because 'corrupt' you wanted to host the Olympics. There are others, and though they are fair in the context that the game remains balanced for both sides, it breaks the immersion greatly and can be quite a nuissance.   The rest of the game is satisfactory. Not amazing, but not bad either, save the tutorial which is mediocre.   I don't want to make this game sound too bad, but a lot of the good things about this game have already been mentioned. It is good, but I am marking 'Not Recommended' because the hype is more than a bit much. It is a decent game.  Now, as an adaptation of a boardgame, this is amazing.
