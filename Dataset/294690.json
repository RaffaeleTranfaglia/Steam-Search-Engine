            "review_text": "During the late 90’s/early 2000’s Humongous Entertainment released an absolutely fantastic stream of “edutainment” point and click adventures for children. These titles focus on a range of light academics including basic geography, basic to upper elementary level mathematics, logical thinking, critical thinking and puzzle solving, topped off with reinforcement of good manners and polite social etiquette. At the lower end of the age spectrum, they may require some adult supervision and supportive guidance, but there is no better series of games for a child’s first venture into PC gaming.  Putt-Putt Joins the Circus didn’t really stick in my memory like the other titles. Much like Putt-Putt Enters the Race, I was beginning to grow out of these games and I think that is mostly to blame. The Circus is certainly not the best title in the series but it’s definitely better than the Race.",

This one doesn't have much randomization to speak of in the slightest but makes up for it with a longer runtime than average, though the puzzles aren't particularly more difficult (they might actually be easier than ever before, really.) Plenty of diverse characters on display too and a pretty decent setting. I found it fun enough, perhaps my favorite of all the humongous games I've been playing recently, so~",
