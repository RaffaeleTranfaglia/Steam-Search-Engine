            "review_text": "  I've never been a fan of point and click games, I actually avoided them for the most part. I was more then surprised when I found myself enjoying this game.  Gameplay - The Good  - To start us off I'll say the game perfectly on it's highest resolution settings. No frame drops or issues of any sort. - Hilarious/Funny interactions between the two main characters and others that you meet later. - Supporting characters are funny and interesting. Actual thought was put into there point of existance. - There are easter eggs to other shows and movies that make for a lot of laugh out loud moments(for me atleast). - Great story that could have been generic but was expanded upon as you find more clues about your brother. - Voice acting was great - Everything you clicked on was explained by Ambers voice actor. In funny ways for the most part. - Love that the game is being played out as a 10 year olds imagination. How the stuffed animals are considered real people. - Puzzles were easy and rewarding. For almost every puzzle, you'll have to combine items to further yourself through the game. - Short loading screens between rooms. - If you're ever stuck Ted.E.Bear gives hints to what you have to do next. - Average length for an episodic game(2 hours). - $5.49 Canadian/$4.25 U.S. Considering how much fun and how much I laugh playing this game. I'm more then OK with the price. I can only hope the next episode is as good if not better. - Nice typical cliff hanger to set up the next episode. Made me excited for what may happen.  - The Bad   - Didn't feel like there was a lot of interaction. Felt like you spend more time watch the game then playing it. Since I'm new to the point and click genre I don't know if this is a common thing. Outside of that the story telling was interesting enough for me to not really care for this negative note.  Overal I loved this game. I had a lot of fun playing through, I cared for the characters and I actually laughed out loud to the jokes(something I don't do often enough). If you haven't tried this game out yet or are interested at all, I say get it. You won't regret it.  I made a video for anyone interested.         YouTube™ Video:  Bear With Me Mouthy Review&nbsp;",

            "review_text": "  Creepy,Funny and chilling Crime Noir Tale about a Girl named Amber and a Detective named Ted E. Bear.  As far as point and clicks I loved it I've played tons of point and clicks and this is one of my favorites. It's film noir black and white art style showing only certain colors outside of the black and white spectrum made me think of Sin city.   but don't let the title or cute animals fool you, This is a grown ups game how ever it doesn't throw bad language around like candy on halloween night.  The main character Amber is a very smart kid definetly a contender for best female protag  The voice acting is excellent.  The story does have jokes from time to time but it never let's the jokes break up a tense situation.  I really liked this game a-lot it was very cute and I finished it about an hour and 50 minutes but that's just episode 1. i'm excited for the rest.",

Currently only Episode 1 is out but I actually really enjoyed it, however, my only fault is there was a lot of dialogue that just kept reiterating the same facts that we had already learnt. It is short but at times feels like things are goign rather slow unfortunately. Despite this I still recommend this game, I still really enjoyed it and was sad when it was finished.

            "review_text": "I'm on the fence about giving this a thumbs up, but on balance it's a decent enough introductory episode, albiet one with some obvious, if not entirely enjoyment-breaking flaws.  I'm a sucker for noir and crossing that with something cute/a bit silly is no problem for me. The style of the game is decent, with decent art and decent music. The voice acting (especially for the Mugshot Brothers) is pretty good, especially for a game of this size. The story, unfortunately, is extremely short and falls flat on actually achieving any tension. Don't get me wrong - I don't mind short games - but this episode seems a little TOO short for what I feel like the story was trying to achieve. There are also some issues with the way dialogue was strung together where certain sentences cut off too quickly to sound natural - a small complaint, but when your game has so few elements it needs to get them all right.  The puzzles are few and pretty easy, but some are very non-intuitive (e.g., why can't I use my knife to punch into the glass for the clock? Nails are generally for nailing things - you're telling me she could push the nail through the glass, but not the knife?). There's only one solution for any given puzzle, and sometimes it takes a lot of annoying clicking and dragging around from your inventory to figure out what's what. While this is a problem a lot of click-and-point games suffer, that doesn't excuse any single game from being pointed out for this flaw.  I feel like it suffers just a little from trying too hard - trying too hard to be funny/clever, trying too hard to stuff itself with references from all over the map and across genres, trying too hard to break the fourth-wall at every opportunity, trying too hard to get the point across that it doesn't take itself too seriously while also making sure you know it's selling the noir-ness of it all as much as possible. When a game tries too hard (or seems to try to hard) it loses potential for forging its own identity. I actually thought the best moment in the game was when it stuck to its noir roots and had Ted. E. Bear monologue about the unfairness of life and the fact that they had to set aside the grimness of the situation and push forward to solve the case.  I'm going to give this a thumbs up on balance and hope that future episodes improve in length, in puzzle elements, and in finding a more nuanced and firm identity as a noir-rooted game from the perspective of a child and the denizens of her make-believe city.",

            "review_text": "Bear With Me is a point 'n' click adventure game being released episodically. This review touches upon the first part which had been released at the time of writing.  In the game of which the gameplay is very traditional to its genre, you play as Amber, a 10-year-old girl, whose brother has suddenly gone missing. To find his brother, Amber needs to recruit a retired investigator and her old buddy, Ted. E. Bear. The game features cartoony graphics mixed in with noir elements and is almost entirely portrayed in black and white, with the exception of red in relation to the villain of the story. It's description-heavy with the characters having a lot to say about almost any object on screen.  The first part clocks in at a little under two hours, and the puzzles themselves thankfully aren't obscure like they can get in some of the games of this genre. In fact, they're mostly on the easy side, with the player most likely already figuring out what to do only as the problem is presenting itself. For me, there was only little pixel-hunting involved, a problem also often expected with this style of gameplay.  The voice acting is generally pretty good. In a way, it's one of the highlights of this game. When it doesn't quite work, it's more of a writing problem than that of acting itself. We'll get back on that.  As for what needs work in my opinion, well... Let's start with the music. Or the fact that there is almost none.  In Bear's room, there's a pleasant jazz tune playing on a gramophone (or a record player, as I seem to recall the game calling it). In every other area of the game, there is no music at all. I see no reason to not have music like that playing throughout the game, especially to reinforce the noir atmosphere the developers seemed to want to go for.  Music does so much to the atmosphere in any game, and once you make key stylistic choices for your game, you should hold on to them with each element to reinforce the integrity. Have some more smoky jazz playing in the background and there you go! As it stands however, you mostly get noises of the storm raging outside, which isn't too bad - it's a bit of a writing trope, but isn't that the point?  Which brings us to the final point of my review, as well as my biggest gripe with this game - the writing.  The writer seems to think that jokes breaking the fourth wall are always funny. Even if they are told all the time. As in nearly ten times in the span of two rooms. You're wired to look at everything in games like these, and the game 'rewards' you with another bad joke that breaks the fourth wall.  Here's an example: after inspecting an object, Bear starts reading a bracketed text about the characters moving away from said object, out loud. The joke is that the voice actor would accidentally read this text without actually being supposed to. Amber then tells him he shouldn't read the text inside brackets out loud, and then the voice of the 'director' tells the 'crew' to keep rolling despite this obviously staged error.  That's not good.  Then we have some direct references to other games and whatnot in forms of 'this is not Resident Evil' and the really cringeworthy CSI: Miami 'yeahhhh' joke. Not terribly impressive and only really yank the player out of the world in the game. Granted, this kind of humor can be found from many games of this genre, but it's really easy to have too much and it shouldn't be shoved down your throat like this.  Then we have some jokes that are outright broken. At one point there's an acoustic guitar on top of a cabinet. Bear comments it by saying something along the lines of: 'It makes me want to get up on the stage and smash up the drumkit.' See, it would kind of work if it was an ELECTRIC guitar, but it's not. Why would an acoustic guitar evoke any sort of rock 'n roll spirit? It makes no sense.  Next, we have many, many jokes about the development of this game and games in general. About how the writing is lazy and how the graphic artists are lazy and so on and so on. Again, poor fourth wall. But are these really even funny to anyone apart from the development team past maybe the first one? If you have to use that joke, don't write like ten of them in a two-hour game.  In conclusion, I have to say you can tell love went into making this game. As I understand, the writer of the game was also the director, and possibly also the person who originally came up with the whole idea to make this game in the first place. The writing as a whole isn't terrible, in fact, I thought the more serious parts were pretty well written. If you don't mind humor that constantly breaks the fourth wall with plenty of references to things other than the story itself, you will probably enjoy this game - it's a solid game on other respects, gameplay, atmosphere (apart from the absence of music) and the voice acting are all good.  I did enjoy the game and will be eager to see how the rest of the game will turn out. Here's hoping the writing matures a little bit on the episodes that follow, though.",

We were so sad when we got to the end of the episode and quickly rushed back here to see if the next episode was available.  The two main characters have a great banter and enjoyable characteristics. We want to know more about their back story and help them solve this mystery.  The user interface is straight forward and the puzzles make sense; even if we did have to look for help on one of them.  This is a cute, fun, family friendly, point-and-click adventure with straight forward puzzles and plenty of humour.  Shadallark",

            "review_text": "Never mind the long playtime here. I left the game on as I rand errands. Tl;dr : This is a short, boring game.   The trailer looked great. The gameplay trailer looked fun! Sadly Bear With Me turned out to be a boring pixel hunter. To make matters worse it’s really, really, short. Painfully short considering it’s price. $4.99 of point and click fun should feel like an experience, not a paid half demo.   A half demo really?  Yep, Bear With Me feels like the first half of a Kickstarter Demo for a game that could be. I get the feeling that this was supposed to be a free intro chapter and maybe devs decided at the last minute to charge for it. Long story short, nothing of interest happens in this first episode.  Nothing.  You meet some of the main characters, hear some plot, find some hidden objects and make it to the attic and then BAM its over and you watching the credits in disbelief. How this game is getting so many good reviews on Steam is totally beyond me. I found myself stuck for a long while trying to open something with no clear direction at all. When I finally gave up and tried every random thing in my inventory to open it, a small nail did the job. It was such a stupid answer the game called itself out for lazy writing.  Really?  While the voice acting was alright, I found myself getting more and more annoyed at hearing the same lines over and over again. Especially Milly’s annoyance with me for not knowing what to do next. This leads to a huge problem with Bear With Me, no story/progress journal. If you take a break from this game and forget it’s forgettable tale and come back to it you are kinda screwed if you were in the middle of looking for something. You have no way to keep track of what your objectives are and what you accomplished. I cannot believe this is missing.  Sigh.  I want to love Bear With Me. Heck, I’d be OK with liking it and having honest hope for it. But the truth is Bear With Me feels like a short wasted opportunity. That said this is just the first chapter. Granted it’s a pitifully small chapter, but maybe, just maybe, it might get better from here. Then comes two important questions:  Is this game worth your time and five dollars? I hate to sound like a jerk, but no. I was annoyed through most of it thanks to the unclear gathering puzzles and lack of objective tracking system. The promise of a good, engrossing introduction to this world story kept me on the hook, but ultimately let me down. That being said, I cannot recommend this game to you. I played through it twice while making different choices hoping for a better experience, but I didn’t get one. Will I buy the next episode?  Kinda doubtful. Maybe, just maybe if I am lucky enough to be flush with money I might. But really for what I got out of this initial experience it doesn’t seem worth it. Also since most of the Steam reviews for this game are totally glowing, I get the feeling that it will end up as more of the disappointing same.  I hate writing bad reviews for games I wanna love, but what you just read is it. I’ll follow this game on Steam and hope for updates that make me hopeful for the sequel. Lets see what happens.      AVOID THIS.",
