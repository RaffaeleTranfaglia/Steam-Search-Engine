            "review_text": " This game was great. Pure and simple.   This is my first review, so i'll keep it short(ish). I struggle to find anything wrong with this game, but if I were to point at one thing it would be that some of the cinema-scenes were a bit long. Sometimes it felt as if you were watching the game rather than playing it. That said I really enjoyed this. The puzzles were good (and I have played alot of point and click) and they did not feel to repetitive. They were also challenging but not over hard. Every time I got stuck I just had to rethink the situation, and usually the solution would present itself. I'm not proud to say this but I have a tendensy to use walkthroughs whenever I get stuck for too long. I only did that once here and that turned out to be a puzzle that used color. I'm colorblind so that does'nt really count....  I thought it was a good story to, and unlike some of the other reviewers I rather liked Fenton as the hero. He's a bit cheeky and a bit of an anti hero, but after playing many of these games I find that usually is the case. I did not find it laugh out loud funny, but I found his coments rather amusing.  I also liked all the different places one got to travel to. It made it feel like you really were on a quest, unraveling an ancient secret, unlike many games that just puts you right near the goal at the start. The graphics were also very well done. They made the atmosphere complete and added to the story in a great way.  All in all this game really sucked me in from the get-go. It had a movie quality about it that really made me feel like I was there. It never felt boring and I was rather sad when it ended. (Thats a good thing.) I spent 17 hours on this game and thats not half-bad considering it cost me only about £8. I never replay games, but I'm really considering doing it with Lost Horizon. I give it a solid   9/10.  If you like adventure and ancient mysteries this is a no brainer.",

            "review_text": "Lost Horizon was a very enjoyable experience. This game has it all, nazi's, evil scientists, Tibetan monks, henchmen with weapons, and beautiful women. The main protagonist is Fenton Paddock, a down and out pilot who finds himself trapped in the wrong place at the wrong time. He is quick witted and often hilarious. One of the main drawbacks of my recent adventure game purchases has been the quality of the voice acting has been very low. This was not the case with Lost Horizon. The accents of the different characters are convincing and the delivery is very smooth. Nothing can kill my immersion faster than a character speaking who sounds like an actor reading a line. As far as the puzzles go, I did not come across any that required a guide, as they all seemed very rational. Overall, if you enjoy point &amp; click adventures with puzzles that aren't illogical, voice acting that is top notch, and en exciting story, you need to pick this up!  ",

            "review_text": "Really enjoyable adventure game with fun sloppy accents and silly situations - an adventure film with interaction. Some of the puzzles can get annoying - like seriously what the hell!? (and it will annoy you if you lose the flow and get stuck on one puzzle - but that's what GameFAQ's is for right :p)   For the most part it's a very enjoyable game with great visuals, and a really nice soundtrack. There's no branching paths or anything whacky happening with the dialogue but just a good old fashioned adventure narrative traversing parts of Britain, The Himalayas, and Germany.   One major annoyance was the completely different look in-game of the main characters as opposed to that used on the promotional posters/advertising - it makes absolutely no sense - but that's a superficial thing spurred by the evils of the marketing department, so we can disregard their input :p",

I should let you know that I got this dirt cheap.  + Atmosphere: yes it does rip off a lot but at least the source material it stole from is great.  + Voice acting  - Gameplay: easy puzzles to just guesswork. Aolt of repetive back and forth visting places I have been just for one item.  For the most part this is family friendly game.",
