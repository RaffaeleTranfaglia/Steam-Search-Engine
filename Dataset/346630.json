            "review_text": "If you want a nice puzzle platformer with some story, not too long, and also you can live with fact that it is an indie game, so graphically not the best (but great mechanics in the game, and gameplay &gt; graphics), also if it is on sale (-75% = 1,25 euros), go for it, you can spend nice 3-4 hours in this game (3,3 hours is my game time, i've completed whole game and also achievements in that time :) but i really love these kind of game, so i have an advantage :) ). Is it hardcore platformer? No, but some parts can be, especially last level, with boss. Is it hardcore puzzle game? Not really, but again, some puzzles can be harder, and you have to work with gravitation and game's physics. Is it worth 5 euros? I think yes, i've enjoyed this game, and the only con is graphics (not really my cons, as i prefer gameplay, not graphics :) ).",
