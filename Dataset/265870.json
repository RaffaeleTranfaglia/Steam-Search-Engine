            "review_text": "Alpha Kimori: Great Doubt - Episode One is Sherman3D’s first foray into making an in-house video game, with their previous work having been mostly outsourced programming and artwork for games such as Drawn to Life and Scribblenauts - and a fairly good first game at that. Sherman3D have brought something fairly unique to the table by releasing a Malaysian-produced Role-playing game more in-line with classical Japanese RPGs than anything.  Alpha Kimori takes place in a future in which aliens known as Centaurians have invaded Earth. A god-figure known as alpha Alpha - a giant spaceship - comes to the planet and rescues a chosen few humans, who are in-turn protected by 7 Angels who serve it. Alpha brings these humans to Kimori, a new planet in which humanity can begin anew.  The humans quickly run afoul of eachother and split into two warring factions, the Bidarians and the Jinrians. The Bidarians wish to drain Kimori of its resources (Crystals known as Ki Crystals) to create an attack force to take back Earth by force, while the Jinrians wish to live in harmony with their new planet and embrace the second chance they have been given.  Alpha Kimori follows Rick, a genetically-enhanced Bidarian supersoldier who begins to question whether the values he was raised on are morally right, or if he was just raised to believe they were. The story is a politically-rich tale with surprisingly complex themes of morality and legacy, and there are enough twists and turns to keep you gripped and waiting for the next scene of character interaction to find out where the story is going.  The story is definitely the most important and interesting aspect of Alpha Kimori, and you will find yourself pining for the second episode by the time you’re finished with the five hours this title delivers. Despite a few spelling errors and awkward translations here and there, the story is detailed and well put-together, and will definitely have you thinking about it afterwards.  The game is designed much like a standard old-school JRPG and doesn’t have that many unique aspects going for it as far as gameplay is concerned. It is an unfortunate example of an average game in this respect, as what it does pretty much just works and isn’t that interesting. This is especially noticeable at times in the story when you are expected to backtrack through areas littered with the most basic of enemies.   Much like in Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, the combat system is a standard turn-based tirade with attacking, special abilities, guarding, and items. There is no substance and no interesting combat options. Even when you unlock one of the most important plot-related abilities, it’s just slapped in the Skills menu with your other abilities. The only thing setting it apart from regular JRPGs is the fact that combat order isn’t dictated by a speed stat - instead the player characters always go first, except for one minor exception found in an extremely easy fight later on in the game.  I found the biggest problem with the gameplay is how insultingly easy it is. I didn’t find myself challenged by a single fight until the final boss, which was just straight-up unfair unless you have a good stockpile of powerful healing items. For the most part I found I could win fights in a single turn, which was only furthered by the fact the critical hit rate in the game is ramped up all the way. Critical hits happened so often that it looked like they may as well have swapped the crit rate with the normal hit rate.  Most new areas came with enemies that were only slightly more difficult (Generally more health and a tiny bit more damage) but with exponentially increased experience rates. In one area I was getting 100 experience per enemy, only to have that boosted to 300 per enemy in the next. This made me feel like I was permanently overleveled and made the game a breeze, coupled with the fact leveling up restores all your health and Ki (The game’s Magic Points).  Disappointingly, the design of the game feels like a lot more effort was put into artificially extending the game than creating anything with substance. You are repeatedly sent back through areas that have no relevance to the story whatsoever, and some parts even damage the story just for the sake of 10 minutes of added length.  The backtracking isn’t all bad though, as graphically the game is spectacular for what it is. All the graphics are beautifully hand-crafted pixel art very reminiscent of Phantasy Star and the Super Robot Taisen series, and the battle graphics are fully animated and a joy to watch, and each area was designed extremely well and rewarded venturing from the route you were to follow, making the backtracking a perfect chance to go back and find things you’d missed the first time around.  Accompanying every area, battle, and gripping scene is Alpha Kimori’s absolutely superb soundtrack. There is very little to complain about with the music in the game, with every song perfectly orchestrating the importance and emotion of every scene. The composer of Alpha Kimori really outdid themselves and I applaud them for creating such a beautiful soundtrack, which is most definitely the best part of the entire game and made my experience all the more enjoyable.  In conclusion, there are a few major problems with Alpha Kimori, but these could all easily be fixed, and I eagerly await the second episode with fingers crossed hoping that they have done so. I would recommend picking up this game if you value story more in video games more than anything else, as it is a spectacularly well-told story which now has me craving the second episode just so I can find out what happens!  7/10",

            "review_text": "Very unbalanced, seemingly unfinished even for an episode. You could grind and buy the weapons and armor in the stores like I did, but nearly everything but the shields are given to you just by wandering around. It's not like the encounter enemies really need it. And the prices for the (only) weapons in the shop are in the 4000-6000 range, while most of the enemies don't drop nearly that much gold. Everything else in the shops is priced at nearly 1/10 of that. Lots of artificially forcing you to walk everywhere, with tight corners to force you to battle monsters. Oddly inserted fetch quests, having to randomly grab 50 of an item, which I conveniently had through grinding.  Near the end of episode 1, I was Level 37 with all the equipment upgrades and could crash through scores of enemies without really needing to heal (even outside of battles). But the last boss fight of the episode nearly slaughtered me.   2/5 - 1/2 of every character's HP from the two group attacks each round, with two extra individual attacks. The best healer is the only character who has a group attack at that point, and my characters spent most of their time healing, and still losing HP. Two of the characters' healing skills only healed about 1/5 HP. Either the encounter enemies were too weak or the boss was too strong. No group heal skills, but all characters have individual heal skills. Only two characters can heal strongly enough to offset the continuous damage.     Supposedly your character wants to live without killing or hurting, but you can't help but slaughter the local wildlife.   It wasn't ever made clear if those monsters are also part of the Ki Monsters that I supposedly hate killing  . There were several battles where I'd defeat the super-powerful boss and then the plot would still show me defeated. I was death on RPG rails and everyone called me lazy and under-achieving. It doesn't seem like your performance affects the plot much. In fact, only 3-4 skills per character at Level 37. Pretty vanilla for the understated town badass. Any other skills probably won't exist until the next episodes. Doesn't seem worth the grind to find out.  Nice animations, good sprites. Seems like it's based off of one of the RPG Maker engines, so it was odd to hear my laptop fan (2Ghz x4 Core i7, FirePro M5950) running at full-blast for 2D tiles and it still wasn't smooth. I don't think I'd try it on the minimum specs. Maybe it was the AMD drivers, but more visually impressive games are smoother and less demanding. It's probably RPGMaker, which never seems to be smooth in full screen mode. The game didn't seem like it would run in windowed mode, though (Alt+Enter). It would show a window, but only display 1/4 of the screen in it.  It has potential, but because of the plot on rails it seems more like I'm playing a visual novel with a high encounter rate than an RPG. Seriously, one weapon upgrade. It  might  be worth $5 (half the price), but I'd look around and catch it in a bundle or on sale, rather than paying full price. 2D JRPGs are nostalgic, but it's not like they're uncommon, even today. And better ones exist, both new and classic. Go back and play Phantasy Star IV, Final Fantasy VI or Grandia (3D maps, 2D sprites), instead.",

I Can't wait to play the next episode, because the ending here in episode 1 made me curious. Though this episode 1 had too short gameplay. The Difficulty here i think is under the standard rpg that i already played before. But Overall I Like This Game 7/10. It Will Be 9/10 if the dev increase the difficulty a bit. Hope The Next Episode released on steam earlier.",

I would probably give 4 of 10 points.  I want to edit now: I played it to the end within 6 hours in total. And i have to admit the story really is facinating. The engine is pretty bad I think, but what do you expect from a game made from the RPG maker.  But I'm looking forward to see how the story develops! Now it's 6/10 points.",
