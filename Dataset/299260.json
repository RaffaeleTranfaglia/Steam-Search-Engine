Considering I got it for free of course, but if you are getting it for 10 euros, or even on sale, let's say 3 euros, it's simply not worth it. You can analyze it was ported straight over from mobile to pc, no improvements/modifications to the UI or whatsoever. Cannot recommend it, for the price, for it's poor mechanics and for the non-existent effort to adapt the game to a new and different plataform.",

But after I play like Level 7 or 8, the game got crashed. But, here's the review. Positive: -The Gameplay is fun, not too simple but still great -The Control is good but not the goodest -Awesome background music (Its like Plant vs Zombie) Negative: -We got money so easy, no challenge. Play, Finish 1 level, You got a lot of money -The Control of the Guns is so terrible. We have to click Left and Right Mouse to shoot the gun. -Lot of Bugs, Crash -The menu too much, too much column -Bad Aiming, when we want to aim the gun, we need 5 seconds maybe for nice aim to the alien I will give this game, 4/10",

Resolution is capped and cannot be changed - the game looks ugly even on a 1080p display.  The game relies on simple tower defense mechanisms, but also a 'first person' mode where you control a gun that you can use to shoot any enemies that get by. The problem is they don't allow mouse aim - you have to use WASD to try point the gun! Incredible incompetence in UI design.   Obvious thumbs down. Plenty of other tower defense games to choose from.",

You can go into first-person mode and shoot some aliens yourself, but the core gameplay is still pretty familiar. So what it really comes down to is execution. And, well...it's a mobile port. It's VERY CONSPICUOUSLY a mobile port. The interface is clearly designed for a touch screen. There are no keyboard shortcuts and no way to change the controls. It runs in a fixed fullscreen resolution, so if you want to go into windowed mode or adjust it to fit your monitor better...sorry, there's no option for that.  To top it all off, it's priced at $10, which is quite frankly an unreasonable price point for a port so lacking in polish. There are tower defense games out there that are just as good or better that you can play totally free.  Look, I like the tower defense genre, but you can do a lot better than this game. Do not recommend.",
