The basic strategy type is not new -- I've played flash games where you had to balance mining asteroids for resources with building defense installations while keeping them connected. But  NANULEU  only has 7 levels total (each level only has 1 difficulty) and a frustrating difficulty curve.  Creeper World  is much more fun to play, or even  BattleTime ; these games have more levels and will last you longer.  Needs more levels.",
