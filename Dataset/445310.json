However it didn't change that settings only for Trial by fire but for every other game and even on Desktop with only Windows running, it shut the system down after 10-15 minutes. Uninstalling didn't help at all. Just imagine your PC shuting down again and again with no reason, and nothing helps.  I managed to restore Windows 7 from a System security saving after 3 hours trying around and that finally fixed the Problem.  So This is not only a review its a warning. This game might screw your PC for good!",
