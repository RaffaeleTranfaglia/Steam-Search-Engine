            "review_text": "TLDR; Spandex Force is a fun casual match 3 game at the right price, but be warned its main story does have a time limit.  Spandex Force is a match 3 game which you play a superhero in training, and you gain power and attack through a match 3 game type system. Its core gameplay is pretty interesting at times, but overall it doesn't require alot to play a few matches, and you can go off and do your own thing. The story is generic, but it has a few side minigames that provide some variety. While progression is slow (painfully sometimes if you are just trying to rush through) it has enough bells and whistles to sidetrack you from feeling like you are just grinding one scenario. Overall a fun game, but the main mission does have a 30 day in game time limit.  Pro's: Match 3 with an upgrade system to vary how you play Fun gameplay (if you like Match 3's) Never really over/underpowered in the main storyline Varied minigames/sidegames that break the monotany from time to time Casual match 3 fun  Con's: Upgrade system could use some tweaking Can become really grindy in some aspects The rock paper scissors aspect of your attacks never really come that far into play Attacking enemies is slow, takes like 5 seconds each attack and it takes on average 6 attacks to kill a guy  Buy it if you are looking for a under $5 game to pass a few hours, it will give you that at a minimum.  *Final note: Dev seems to be pretty responsive on the forums, which is always really appreciated.

            "review_text": "port of a tablet game. has a fixed resolution that made the game unplayable for me because of slow-down. was a neat little game but inability to do simple things like change the resolution gives this one a pass. if it's ever updated to be an actual PC game and not a lazy tablet port, i'd recommend it. until then don't bother.  i refunded this game after being submitting a ticket about the resolution problems and getting a response that the resolution was fixed in this PC release. maybe you'll have better luck.  down vote only because of technical issues, switches to recommend if it's properly fixed.",
