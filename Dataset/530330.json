I'll just say that while it's nice for what it is, there isn't really much to it. Since it's free you should still check it out if you like trying out beginner game projects.  +The visuals are simple in nature but lit realistically, so the game looks pretty convincing aside from a few out-of-place assets, reminds me somewhat of the visuals in the PS2 Silent Hill titles. Assuming this is the creator's work and isn't a Unity store asset flip, it's pretty impressive. +The interactivity is well put together. &gt;There's multiple ways to complete the puzzles, but   all paths seem to lead to the same ending, that hints that there might be more coming.   -Short, doesn't explain much,   seems to be a set-up to a bigger game.   -Bugged out at one point: While inspecting the piece of paper in the tool shed my flashlight got stuck and just hung in the air, but could still be used by hitting 'F' which would make it appear and disappear.  Good for a first project, serves pretty well as a proof-of-concept for a larger game if that was the intention.",

A first person horror, adventure puzzle combination it was a bit short but enjoyable for me. I enjoyed the story it had a good level of puzzle solving to progress and a bit of a spooky feel in some parts. The graphics were decent enough the narration very good the puzzles were obvious with a little bit of thought but you are still kept intrested and want to continue. I played mine on my laptop i3 4gb ram dedicated graphics card win 10 and it ran very smooth with no glitches so you don't need i5 or i7 like it states. I played through twice so as to get the last achievement i missed the reader when you click on a note to read it click it again and it will read it to you then you will get that achievement.......

Overall it felt like a decent foundation for a good game. Unfortunately, when I was thinking of what secrets this game holds and curiosity pushed me forward while the suspense was building up and my instinct of self preservation screamed at me to be careful as I slowly progressed through the dark places not knowing what exactly should I expect and then I finally managed to escape, I was pretty soon confronted with the sad truth that this game is just that - a good foundation for a good game, but not much else. I wish this game was longer, I wish there was more to it. Honestly, I did not read the description of the game prior to playing, I wanted to be surprised, but I can't lie, when I realized this game is just a short story, I was disappointed. After playing this game, I had mixed feelings. I'm not exactly a fan of short story games. I can't help but think of this game as of Duty Calls: The Calm Before the Storm version of Outlast. Even the meaningless stick and the 500 sheets of wide-ruled notebook paper have their counterparts here, but perhaps that is just my misunderstanding of the short story games... The ultimate question I obviously have to answer is whether I would recommend this game to anyone or not. Well, despite my own disappointment, I am open minded and I would like to support what little good was brought for free in this title, so that's the main reason why this review is positive. Good luck to the creators of this game, thank you for this little game and I hope to see more games from you, hopefully longer games next time! :-)  6/10",

It's neat. I like the fact that at least on one place, you have two ways of solving a problem. The puzzles aren't very complicated or based on particularly great mechanics, but they feel natural enough, and I could care for a longer experience with that type of gameplay.  Because it's not going to take a long moment of your life to traverse. And quite honestly, I just don't get what the ending is suppose to say. The build up is okay for that type of short experience, but it goes pretty much nowhere.  It's free, you can totally try it. It's worth the hour (or less) you are going to spend on it. I just hope the devs are working on a more 'complete' game in terms of story at least.",

I found the first ending, going over the scaffolding. I tried to get out the garage for another ending, but I got hit by the guy, and when it loaded my check point, I kept falling through the floor into nothingness. So, I have no idea how that will end. But don't really care enough to play it again... Also, devs, as cool as lens flares are, if you're trying to make it a realistic first person experience, keep in mind the human eye doesn't see lens flares. So unless you're supposed to be seeing all this through a camera, there was no need for a lens flare on the moon.",

That said, the ending is amusing, and that payoff makes it worth the short playthrough.  The bad parts are: nauseating camera movement, confusing and frustrating game mechanics, graphics from 2003, bad sound design, bad lighting, bad voice acting, useless jumping, having to do multiple mouse clicks to complete reading notes or opening some locks, some useless objects to interact with, lots of objects you can't interact with even though it looks as if you'd be able to, some bugs like not being to pick up objects placed on a place of interest, illogical inventory system, unnecessary male voiceover might be alientating for female players.  The game actually feels like someone's practice attempt att level design, which barely works, but, as I suggested above: if you start it, be sure to complete it (there are gudies here at steam, if you get stuck).",

The graphics are actually pretty good, but it's hard to find some objects because they blend in with the back-ground, rendering them nearly impossible to see. There really isn't much of a heavy plot-line and such, so if you want a game with a really deep plot you probably shouldn't probably get this.  So in conclusion I'd like to say that for a free game, it's pretty good, but if you want a really involving game to play this isn't the game for you.  Extra: They're probably going to fix some of what I said in future updates, so if you really want this wait till they update it a bit more.",

The game feels very good in the sense that it possesses a creepy atmosphere, and the controls are very easy. While the voice acting is by no means fantastic, I have certainly heard worse. the music is minimal but it fits in fine. Figuring out the puzzles was not difficult, but that's subjective. If you're good at solving puzzles, this game may not be challenging for you. If you just looking for a bit of fun (an hour at most), then this may suit you. Unfortunatly, while there are two routes to reaching the end, the end is exactly the same no matter how you get there. There are no moral choices to be made, and how you solve the puzzels seems to not make a difference. The overarching mystery will remain unsolved no matter what you do, which I find disappointing. This game is more aimed at an escape rather than uncoving the mystery. That said, considering it is a free game, and the fact that it works fine (no crashing, only one point that caused a noticable FPS drop, and only one or two non-game-breaking visual bugs), I would say if you think you may enjoy it, there is no harm in giving it a try.

            "review_text": "So, from what I understand of the story, this game is a prequel to an upcoming game by Vaclav Hudec (it's hinted at in the final cutscene). In that case, I'm going to write this review in the context of constructive criticism and give feedback as to what can be improved for the full game.  (spoilers ahead)  Firstly, something I love about this game is its atmosphere. I dreaded each creepy hallway and spooked myself on a number of occasions. This anticipation, of course, made the man at the end seem a whole lot more terrifying. The atmosphere felt very similar to Outlast's, and I can basically describe this game as a puzzle-oriented Outlast.  That said, the puzzles were a bit wonky. I like the idea that each puzzle can be solved in a variety of ways; however, I found myself more often than not searching the room twenty times over because I couldn't find an important object. The placement of key items could be a bit more intelligent (though some objects were cleverly situated, like the pipe in the first room being in the center of the spotlight you could turn on) or there could be more creative item combinations. If you're going to have a variety of interactable objects in a room, why not invent multiple solutions using all those objects? That might even up the complexity of each puzzle, interestingly. In fact, I tried bringing the useless items from the first room--the clamp, saw, hammer--to the next room because I thought they might have some secret use.  TL;DR: Atmosphere was awesome, felt like the secret child of Outlast and Amnesia. Puzzles could be a bit more complex and could have more efficient design so they'd be more about brainwork than trying to find the right items in the environment.  (spoilers end)  If I have some spare money at the time, I'm definitely gonna be one of the first to buy the theoretical sequel. I hope the overwhelmingly positive feedback encourages the developer to produce a full game.",

The 'crafting' element is pretty neat too, fixing the bolt cutters and opening the attic.  Atmospherically, this game is very well made, the music and sounds build up the atmosphere very well. However the game doesn't break the atmosphere, it doesn't release the tension that it builds up. It is a horror game and it should give you active scares not only make you think that something is going to happen because lights went out or the music changed.  The ending was very nice in my opionion. Enjoyed it.  Overall you should definatly give this game a try, it is fun, short and enjoyable.  P.S: Why would you keep the keys in a lock?

Turns out, what I did lose was my time because the game for me was so bugged, I couldn't pick up tools needed in the very first room of the game, and some weren't even there for me to see.  I did consult a walkthrough after about 30 minutes stuck in the first 'puzzle', even though I despise that when it comes to games like this one, and in the videos the game was working fine for those people. Long story short, after about 6 restarts and new games, the game never worked properly for me. So, if you're feeling lucky, give it a shot, hopefuly it'll work for you. Sadly, I can't review the game's content itself since I never got to actually play it, so all I can do now is give this one a thumbs down and wish you all best of luck.",

Of course there are flaws here and there. For example, if you put the saw in the beginning on the table, you'll see it sunk in and the blade disappeared. Also, the logic is seriously funny. I have to find a key to open a padlock while I just need to grab a hammer or a crow bar and disable it just fine? I don't know what material the doors are but I guess it's either wood or plastic, and I'm pretty sure some of those tools around are pretty strong enough to smash a hole open instead of 'there's no door handle' comment. I know it's a fix ending so they have to make the guy a pansy, but seriously if I wake up in a strange place after a guy knocked me out, I'll be damn sure to keep the strongest weapon I can find by my side, duh. I'll run if the bad guy has a gun or something that looks like a scary weapon, but a wooden stick? My god the horror logic LOL Anyway, it's a not so bad game, but can be frustration as I was stuck at the beginning not knowing what I was supposed to do and had to look up the discussions.
