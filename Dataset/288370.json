Still wouldn't recommend in the current state, honestly just stick with the original.   Bought against better judgement (only $3 meh why not), graphics don't seem improved at all, even buggier than the original, shadows and FOV options are completely disabled and the menu even has a link to DLC that doesn't work.  Steam overlay won't show up, voice acting seems just as mediocre as the first (only reason I bring this up is because it was a selling point that they re-recored all the voice lines)  Why does this game exist? Why make a worse verison?  Will update if any of these issues get fixed, until then don't bother spending a dollar on this, let alone three.",

            "review_text": "I personally have the almost the same feeling as original one expect: 1st is the fact that the main story is easier and better looking. 2nd visuals are looking better than previous one,but at cost of shadows...sad. 3rd it gives you almost all DLC(expect soundtrack)from previous game. 4th the voice acting is better,but development of characthers is non-existent still. 5th is story is somewhat remastered. For example on stage where you get the suit,you instead destroying the wreckage,you destroy drones instead. 6th the ending is MUCH easier than previous one. Previous game had it very hard. So far my reactions is the same: mixed. The game is of course better than previous one,but the feelness of underpower combined with bad controls makes it not good. For 20$ like normal one its overpriced,but for 10$ or 5$ it may worth it. For over 10$? Unlikely.",

            "review_text": "It's been quite a while since I played the original SSZ, swearing to never go back to this pile of... disappointment.  Then SSZ DC came out, and I decided to take it for a spin. Why the heck not.  Has the game changed much since the days of the original? Yes. Graphics have been ramped up, textures reworked, the story makes a little more sense now, mission design was improved a bit...  How about gameplay, then? Well, difficulty has been scaled down, going from 'batshit insane' to 'barely managable' (on EASY). Controls have improved a bit, all those bricks they call fighters and interceptors now turn a bit better yet do not loose precision aiming. Capital ships now have their weak points displayed on the HUD so you at least have some help with destroying those monstrosities (and you will be doing a whole lot of that).  And this is where it ends. You still need MAD PILOT SKLZ to have a paper cat's chance in hell to get to the good ending. Check out the achievements ranking to confirm this. The Strike Suit itself still feels flimsy and underpowered - so still no piloting a big indestructable mecha with a can of whoopass In Space. (at least you get it sooner, if that's any consolation) And the music? If you expect a pounding rendition of something like, say, MUSIC FROM THE LAUNCH TRAILER, turn around and walk away. Because this is where the composer that wrote that piece went - and you'll never get a pleasant beat in the whole game.  Was I expecting much? Well, yeah, it was supposed to be a game about War Mecha In Space, and those are generally expected to be made of awesome. Did I get much? Not at all. Even in full cheat mode the game is a chore, flooding you with dialogue when you are way too busy to pay attention, and staying perfectly silent when there's a lull in a battle.  Can I recommend this to anyone I know? NO.",

I do not know about the origninal version of the game, but this directors cut is filled with engaging gameplay, a decent story and filled with atmosphere to the brim.  This is the most fun ihad with a space opera since Freespace. The Strikesuit mechanics are fun and rewarding and really give this vibe of being a powerful presence on the battlefield.  If you ever wanted to pilot a transforming mecha anime style and lay waste to hordes of enemies, here is your chance.  Oh, and the soundtrack is stellar. It was worth buying just for that. Also having a awesome game makes this one of my buys of the year.  9/10 points, for some technical problems that have been fixed by now, but should not have been there at release. ^^  its Worth a buy.",

Really doesn't work well with HOTAS because the throttling isn't specific but rather three speed (normal/fast/slow), and the missions are too samey for my taste.

Lots of nice post processing effects are gone too, and there is absolutely nothing to be seen regarding the improved textures and whatever else they promised. Ran both the old version and new version next to one another and the difference was very noticable. What is even more annoying are the constant hiccups (especially when the camera pans) in the frame rate. Really don't understand why you would release such a broken game. Why not wait until everything has been fixed and then release it? Didn't want to believe the reviews and just upgraded for those mere few euros, but at the moment they feel kind of wasted. Here is to hoping it will get patched really quickly. In it's current state I cannot recommend this game for both new commers and upgrading owners alike.",

To those that have given this horrible reviews with a whopping .1 hours logged into it (6 whole minutes), please load the original then load this one up. If you can't notice the difference you are trying really hard not to see them.  While I thought the original was fun, this one is SO much better that it's worth the upgrade to existing owners and the price for new players too. The models have been completely reworked and look better than ever. If your rig doesn't suck eggs (I only have a low-end gaming rig), you can turn on all the options and everything runs butter smooth.  The story and missions have been reworked to where it actually makes sense now. I don't know what else people want from this game? It has tight controls, a great story, a SPECTACULAR soundtrack, and now the graphics are at that next-gen level. Honestly, if you don't like it, then it might just be that this kind of game isn't for you.  Check out Scott Manley's review for a very fair evaluation of the game and his thoughts on paying extra for an upgrade if you already own it.",

It doesn't even have shadows as a choosable option. How the hell are you going to have people purchase this game, with ZERO multiplayer access, ZERO HD (I've got a 2.5k gaming rig - I run everything on max settings), don't give me that bullsh!t.   Now this game studio releases an 'upgrade'? HOW ABOUT RELEASE A FREE UPDATE FOR FIXING THE THINGS IN A GAME THAT SHOULD BE IN THERE TO BEGIN WITH (i.e. SHADOWS - what a grand idea!! #endsarcasm)  Until then people, wait until it goes down to $1.99. Don't fall into the shininess of the pictures or the space explosions like I did. Save your frikken money.   PEACE.",

Minus : - Upgrade System is bad... Some of the challenge are like Hell  End :  9 From 10  I realy like this game, and I hope you will like it too :P  ",

So many good space sims coming soon!) Graphics are nice, though a bit basic. Ships control well, weapons feel as though they pack a punch and the addition of a transforming mech suit/ship gives the game a bit more depth. Story is well written but the average voice acting lets it down a little. All in all, a solid arcade space blaster which is made more fun with the addition of mech style action. Rating 8/10.

The missions are challenging but never unfair...the story is very interesting and the combat ist great and very intensive.
