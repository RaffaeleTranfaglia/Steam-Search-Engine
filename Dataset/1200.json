It put you on the frontlines of battles that have been fought in countless other games, and in battles that only existed in history books, in photographs, in survivors stories, and in the numbers of lives lost. Some of these battles were never put into a game before.  The game itself was a huge achievement, and it went on to inspire many successful and fun mods. What more can I say after all these years and fun? Play this game, that's what.",

If your more of a CS kind of player and like acarde shooter kind of games this isn't the game for you. If you like realism &amp; team work this is definately the game for you. Although it only has one game mode, Multi-player, the game is awesome. In this game, it is impossible to go alone and try to be a hero. This requires a load of team work. Tanks also give it a boost in points. Since it's not based on the western front, which has been done 101 times, the game is unique. A Very good game. And the fact that you dont have a crosshair also gives it a boost in total realism.",

Never before in an FPS has surpressing fire worked so well. The sound in this game is unreal! When you are being shot at it really sounds like bullets are flying right past your head. Which leads me onto the next point. Imersion. I before said the graphics were dated but the little effects are SOOOO good. When shot at the tracer efects and dust kicked up is soo cool. The first-person animation is supurb which also helps with the realism. I rccomend this game to anyone!",

            "review_text": "NOTE:*****At the time of this review, this game is dead or dying in terms of its playerbase, buy at your own risk.*****  June 22, 1941. Breaking his nonaggression pact with Josef Stalin, Adolf Hitler launches Operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union and begins one of the longest and most brutal campaigns in modern military history. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 masterfully captures this front of the second world war like no other game to date. Red Orchestra is a realistic, team based, multiplayer first person shooter. It is not a simulator like the ARMA series, but is still a game that must played with the upmost seriousness. The game places you into the boots of a soldier in the Soviet Red Army or in the German Ostheer and allows you to assume the different roles of infantry or armored vehicle crewmen. Players can assume a variety of roles from riflemen, assault troopers, and tank crewman to snipers, sappers, tank hunters and tank commanders. Some roles are leadership roles, with the purpose of guiding and ordering your teammates to victory like squad leaders and tank commanders, with the ability to call in support, like devastating artillery strikes. Combat is realistic, tough, and gruesome. Every mistake is punished by death. Infantry must work together, take cover, and use real world tactics, with different roles coordinating with each other to achieve victory. Vehicle crews must also communicate and coordinate if they are to survive, let alone win, whether it's in an APC transporting troops to the frontlines or engaging enemy tanks as a gunner in your own tank. Fight several battles in historical locations all over the eastern front from the earlier days of the onslaught with the victories of the Germans to the final days of the Third Reich, with the Soviets in the heart of Berlin, with several weapons fully realized and vehicles with realistic handling and mechanics. Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45 is one of the most terrifying, realistic, authentic, and greatest multiplayer shooters of all time. A complete masterpiece.",

The whole point of the game, I think, is the gritty experience of getting stuck into a trench with a deadly rifle, daring to pop your head up to get into the fight. Shooting can be brutal, constant deaths, or finding a good spot and getting several kills. I once got into a bayonet scuffle with a player in a room, my heart was pounding when I saw him storm in. It was one-on-one, I don't remember who killed who in the end, I just remember that my hands were shaking, and I loved it.
