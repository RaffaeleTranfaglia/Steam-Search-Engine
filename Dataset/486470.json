            "review_text": "So I tried this game out, hoping for the best. TLDR: It was very impresive in scope but as a player I felt detatched from the game. The npc's sometimes shot me and sometimes didn't, the ships I found I could not customise or learn to make. Basically I just felt like the whole game was a repetative loop of 'Now go here, now do this, no go there, now do that' steps.  I found it fun for the first few deaths, but I got bored once I started to see the game sections repeat themselves. It feels kind of half finished, the content and vision are here but the player needs more personal elements.  In a very funny way, Duskers has what this game lacks BUT duskers lacks what this game has .... if these two Devs could combine Duskers and Derelict.... we may have a masterpiece",

            "review_text": "Well Here is my 30 min review: This game seems to have alot of potential yet it does a terrible job of explaining itself. There is no tutorial and the starter mission seems to be somewhat confusing. The concept is great but when i finnaly got to a space station where the missions are the mission was very vague and didnt tell me where to go. The game can be improved immensly upon by making it more clear atleast on the first playthrough on what to do. This is much like a game Endless Sky which had simmilar beginings as this game yet now it has many different features and a story line. I hope this game can follow the same path and improve. Currently a 6/10 with a whole lot of potential. I will definately be checking this out in the next few months though hoping for some improvements.",
