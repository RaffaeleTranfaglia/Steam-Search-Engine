And it released with day-1 Linux support! :D I'm very happy to have kickstarted this game and I would highly recommend it to anyone that enjoyed playing the old Myst series of games.",

            "review_text": "If you like a wonderful designed world full of interesting puzzles with a good story unfolding, similar to the great classics like Myst and its sequels, you will certainly love this game.  Controls are simple, with the UI being clear and well implemented. Worth to mention is the possibility to easily make notes. The puzzles are smart, well executed, and logical, ranging in difficulty, but always fair and certainly doable. Progress is quite linear but very satisfying and fits the story well. The voice acting is great, unfolding the story towards the end without having to actually read. The music is wonderful and accompanies the game very well. Plenty of different interesting puzzles to solve to reach new and varying areas, resulting in satisfying, well worth game-time (±15 hours).  The developers have done a great job, not just at wonderful graphics and soundscape in a beautiful fictional world. The clues given are clear and the tools provided are very useful. The world was built in a very smart way, giving or restricting access where needed or wished for. Very well executed to give direction to the player, avoiding backtracking or long repetitive walks.  On a final note and certainly no biggie, the only downside that really comes to my mind is replayability value. Due to the linearity of the story and the choice being at the very end of the game, both possible endings are easily accomplished due to the - although useful - (auto-)save feature. I would have loved to see the story hinting at a choice to make at some point in the game, followed by different game-play depending on the chosen path to eventually come to a climactic ending. In comparison, although the ending in Quern did not feel rushed like it did in Obduction, I felt similarly disappointed. The only reason to replay the game would be to get all possible achievements.  All in all a wonderful game I truly enjoyed. Hoping to see more in the future.",

The game does not hold your hand and the puzzles are challenging and clever.  Definitely a great game especially if you enjoyed the Myst series and Obduction.  Edit: So 20 hours later and 23 pages full of notes, I finally finished the game. Definitely worth it!",

            "review_text": "Excellent Excellent puzzle game using the Unity engine, there isn't very many games out there that use unity to its full potential. I have been a huge Myst fan since Myst came out, wasn't too thrilled about Riven tho, but this game beats them all.. graphics turned all the way up. runs smooth as a hot knife in butter.. I would suggest using a computer with at least 6 to 8gb of ram since I had to use my other computer that has 8gb. did not want to load on my 4 gb computer. both are AMD computers, 4gb one is a Phenom II X6 1055T with a 750ti and the 8GB one is a 1090T. with a 750ti as well. So run it on a 6-8gb machine i would suggest. tho you may be able to get it running good on 4gb I couldn't. If you like Myst style games get it at full price or be like me and find it on sale. Either way it is a very well done game!",

            "review_text": "The Good:  Trapped in a magical world by a hidden antagonist who communicates through messages left on pages of a book? Researching the secrets of a lost civilisation, learning their writing and numbering system and solving puzzles involving rotating stone discs and balls? Spinning brass generators, balancing scales, bizarre alchemical equipment and pencil sketches of clues, positioning lens to focus the sun? Any of this sound familiar?   If you liked the Myst series you will like Quern. It looks and feels identical. The setting, aesthetic, story and puzzle types are exactly the same. Right down to the U’nnec’essar’y apostrophes in the names of everything from the ancient c’Ivili’sation (not the D’ni, but it might as well be).   Quern is undoubtedly easier than any of the Myst games and is also a lot uglier. However, the puzzles are good and I’m glad I backed it. Nobody said Kickstarter was meant to encourage originality! It’s a solid game if a bit rough around the edges, it was realised on time in a reasonably polished condition. With the following caveats I would recommend it to anyone who likes Myst…  It’s a game “inspired by Myst” in the same way as Concordski was inspired by Concord.  The Bad  Apart from the total lack of originality in any aspect of this game, my only complaint is that I didn’t always manage to entirely suspend disbelief. It has all the classic puzzle-game tropes used to funnel you through in the right order, one area at a time. For example: the world is full of complex, powered machinery from a long-abandoned civilisation which inexplicably all still works perfectly (including the first button you press which moves a good two-ton block of stone aside to let you pass) and yet a couple of missing rungs in a rope ladder not half a meter above the ground renders the area impassable. Of course all doors can only be opened from one side by a lever (which is a fire evacuation hazard). Which lever, although within easy reach through the sparse iron grating, remains stubbornly locked until you approach it from the correct direction.   A cool idea, badly executed, is the sketchbook. In the game you can press P to draw a pencil screenshot. It’s all very artistic but I can already press F12 to take a Steam screenshot. So I have the choice between taking a really blurry artistic image which necessarily overlays the puzzle it relates to when I open it, or a clear image which I can keep open on my second monitor. The sketching also somewhat spoils the impression I had of an artist drawing all these things, rather than the game just applying a Photoshop filter to them. I liked it in Obduction that they used a camera.   Quern has another classic puzzle game problem : that of making lots of pretty background objects which can’t be interacted with but which would be very helpful for the puzzle if only they were more than just scenery. These things therefore serve first to annoy and then to distract from real objects camouflaged amongst them. For example: I’m in a crystal laboratory and there is crystal testing equipment with lots of generator paddles and electrodes expecting to receive a crystal, and the room is full of likely looking crystals, but they are all background crystals which I can’t use. There _is_ a change of icon between usable and unusable objects but really this should be clearer.   Finally the game is fairly empty of scenery in places. Except for logs. There are lots of logs. I can imagine the designers making a second pass of the rooms and thinking “this looks empty”… “what to do…?” “I know, more logs!” What are the logs even for? I haven’t seen a fireplace yet and everything is powered by crystals anyway.  And finally: it’s a still a bit buggy. I got caught in the clippings a few times, but it’s easy to load a save to get free and this is a very early release so I expect that will get sorted quickly.  The Ugly  This game is superficially quite pretty. However it doesn’t take long to realise it’s lightyears behind any of the Myst series (except perhaps the first one but that was released in 1778 so it’s not really comparable).   The water animation is… really not good (to put it politely). I know moving water is difficult but this is 1990s Tomb Raider bad.   A lot of the other graphics are a bit ropey. For example the rope. If you look at the texture of rope it frequently passes through the things it is meant to be binding.   And whilst I think of it, all the chopped trees have exactly the same “splits and cracks” texture on their exposed ends, where they are supposed to have been cut. And they are cut very cleanly cut too, as if by an industrial logger. Which has no place in this world. I hope. I haven’t finished the game yet.   The draw distance is bad. I don’t know if this can be changed, but by default I’m moving faster than the graphics are rendering.   In terms of graphics I would place this somewhere straight after Riven in the Myst series, when they just started to go with free movement rather than zipping from still to still.",
