The scenery is theraputic, and the mechanics are easy to learn. What makes this game shine the most (for me) is the plethora of 'Worms' ways to control the ball; the spin, parachute and levitating functions add a new dimension to the standard 2-D golfing experience. It's uber retro and eye-candy central.",

            "review_text": "Exactly what you'd expect. Golf with a Worms twist. Not sure if it's worth the asking price, but I got it on sale, so it was definitely worth the price I paid. My only real complaint is that you have to unlock each consecutive hole by shooting a par or better before they let you move on.  I can understand having to unlock the extra courses but unlocking the holes kind of takes the fun out of the game. Part of the challenge of golf is trying to make up for a poor showing on one hole by doing better on the next. They rob you of that opportunity by forcing you to repeat each hole until you 'pass' it. Kind of lame, in my opinion.  Overall, it's a worthy title, though.",

It was fun for a few hours and before I figured out how the specials like reverse gravity worked, it was really challenging.  The game probably is not worth it’s full price since it only entertains for like 4-5 hours, however when another -85% deal comes up it is a real nice game to add to your collection. ",

            "review_text": "Worms Crazy Golf is exactly what it says it is; the game features classic Worms characters, stages, audio, unlockables and customisation in a crazy golf setting.  Instead of killing other worms (which you can still do in this game to create bunkers) your objective is to actually navigate the courses using a variety of clubs and unlockable power-ups. The difficulty level does increase quite rapidly around the 2nd course, but this averages out again once you unlock better power-ups shortly afterwards. IIRC, other than the graphical upgrade, the PC version is also slightly different (harder) than the mobile version as some of the pars are lower. A worthy standalone entry to the Worms franchise in my opinion.",
