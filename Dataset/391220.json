            "review_text": "If you played the last tomb raider game, you will immediately feel right at home with Rise of the Tomb Raider. I say that as a positive thing, becuase Tomb Raider has really improved upon the gameplay elements, graphics and exploration.  So last game was sort of an experiment. It was a reborn of the series and it was a pretty nice, but casual and linear sort of game. This game is still very casual, just like the last game, but levels are more open, and there's things to find in every corner. I like that, becuase im the explorer type in this sort of games. I like exploring to learn more about the world, get upgrades and just get more out of the game.  The story is interesting and kept me playing. I remember that I liked the last tomb raider story as well. This is more of the same. Another journey, but with different landscape. The mountains filled with snow and ice looks great.  Game runs well, but it's really demanding with lots of settings. To play this on ultra you need a beast PC. I play with 980 SLI and because I play 1440p I had to crank some settings down to maintain over 60 fps. This game is filled with all kinds of graphics options, like hair physics, which is only something certain AAA-developers include in their title.  Voiceacting is good, and the sound effect are cool. There's some QTE's in this game, which I don't particulary like. Still, I think the last game had more of it, and most combat in this game is full of action and choice. You can stealth through or go guns blazing. You can also upgrade weapons and equipment more then last game and use that to make the combat more varied.  I honestly don't have any real complaints about this game. It's a good AAA-game with a lenghty story (I probably rush through large parts of it, and also played on an easy difficult mode), nice graphics, story, sound, controls, options menu. Levels are more open, crafing, weapons, etc, have more customization then the last Tomb Raider game.  The ending is very open and definitely sequel baiting. Don't get me wrong though, you get a complete story in this game, but at the same time it does hint at more. I would be okay with another game though. I enjoyed the first remaster of Tomb Raider, and I also enjoyed this title a great deal. Recommended.",

Playing as a grittier, more efficient adventurer gives the player a whole new perspective on Lara Croft. With better puzzles, more interesting and interactive combat and a highly engaging story, Rise of the Tomb Raider makes for an amazing successor to Tomb Raider 2013. Adding much better stealth mechanics to the game provides the player with a whole new way to play the game. However, the game has a particularly short main story. Overall, Rise of the Tomb Raider is a superb addition to the already fantastic Tomb Raider game series.",

            "review_text": "First off, I recommend the game in principle. It is a good game with a good story.   Story   The Rise of the Tomb Raider continues after the previous Tomb Raider game. The difference now is that, where the previous game (TR) develops Lara as an adventurer, this game (TRofTR) assumes that Lara is already established and therefore there is no character development. The most complex character, in my mind, was the main antagonist. The story itself is generally generic. A secret society tries to find an artefact that will help them take over the world and Lara must stop them.  Spoiler: she does.   Gameplay   As before there are open areas in which you can explore, with faster paced action sequences in between. I enjoyed the open spaces, foraging for supplies, crafting, upgrading my weapons and skills. I must admit though, that I wanted some more action sequences. Death is also not as cringe worthy. You fall off things a fair amount and presumably die, but there isn’t that same sense of being truly scared and being forced to survive as in TR. Yes, I know she grew, but I missed that same urgency that drove you on and on (or something similar to that effect).   Conclusion   It is difficult for me to review TRotTR without having TR in the back of my head. On a technical level TRotTR is far better. Larger environments, more tools and weapons, more options. Better graphics. But story-wise the previous one was better. Lara is just an effective and capable killing machine. The enemies are almost, to a man, all masked, so dehumanised. The main antagonist, however, was painted well and had my empathy.    Open questions to the developers:     Please lose Jonah. He’s annoying and, while I suppose he is required to ground Lara, he did nothing in either games. At least give him his mow hawk back so that he may look bad ♥♥♥ if not act it. Otherwise, if she must have someone to support her, introduce new characters more to the like of Conrad Roth or Angus Grimaldi.   Revaluate whether an “archaeologist” (adventurous or otherwise) would use an actual 1000-year-old authentic trebuchet to destroy the gates of a 1000-year-old city in order to get inside (amongst other autrocities). The amount of destruction of a so far hidden and unknown culture was truly horrific to experience. Puzzles are all well and good, but what’s the point if there is nothing left of the culture to document afterwards?  ",

Story is good but it missed some of the mistery from the first game for me, but still good with great VA to back it up.

            "review_text": "I've played all the Tomb Raiders since the original on PS1 way back when I was a kid. So as a TR game I really enjoyed this game a lot! It has the feel and the exploration and platforming of a TR game that I love.  The graphics are spectacular with great effects and immersive beautiful environments everywhere! Its really very very well done visually.  What I didn't like though is the difficulty of the game. I played it on the hardest difficulty and it was far to easy! Compared to the last game the combat was just a cakewalk. In fact it was so easy to headsshot every enemy that I NEVER even saw the close combat dodge/quick kill mechanic till the VERY END OF THE GAME when the final boss fight forced you into it as part of the battle. Because of this I had no idea wtf to do LOL like seriously I had no idea wtf was going on since I never saw that screen the ENTIRE game due to the enemies being so easy to headshot with the bow. Even when the enemies get armor and helmets its still a cakewalk.  I remember when they introduced the harder enemies/mercenaries. They play a small clip where they walk out and look all badass.....2 poison arrows later they are dead.... I seriously thought I was being trolled it was so easy.  You will not run out of ammo unless you try to waste it and run out.  Now Im not saying combat isn't fun, cause it is fun...but It just isn't satisfying when you see a room setup for you to use all these perches and such to take out enemies but there is no point in doing all that when you can end a fight in 5 seconds against 10-20 enemies so easily.   The previous games combat was MUCH more satisfying and felt like you earned every victory in battle. People complained so much about the combat that the devs dumbed it down tremendously in this new game. To me I would rather just play a game without the combat if its going to be this easy...just Saying.  Either make a TR game with proper combat or just make a TR game without it entirely next time.   Overall the game is WORTH playing 100%. Just be prepared for easy peezy fights if you are the least bit skilled at shooting games at all!  Also I didn't bother with the endurance or survival modes or whatever they are called. To me that stuff is just hamfisted attempts at making the microtransaction valid.",

            "review_text": "After the impressive revival of the Tomb Raider franchise in 2013, I had high hopes for this installment. It certainly doesn't disappoint. Rise of the Tomb Raider improves in most, if not all, of the areas that players wanted improvement from Tomb Raider (2013) including more actual tombs! I'll get to that in a bit.   PROS   - Beautiful environments. Graphics were really good generally.  - Voice acting was good, It definitely helps the game.   - The story, overall, is immersive and enjoyable.   - Side quests are a welcome addition that add a bit more length to the game and include some interesting rewards  - Tombs are definitely improved on the 2013 version, there are more of them and they're suitably challenging.   - Character progession offers choice to players. 3 different skill trees with a wide variety of skills that will help personalise your playing experience and augment your play style.   - Plenty of collectibles for people like myself who like that kind of thing. It provides a great reason to explore more of the world as well, which is well worth doing. It's not open world, but it's still fairly expansive in some areas.  - Level design, especially toward the latter stages, is very impressive.    NEUTRAL    - I personally found key bindings on keyboard to be a little awkward, you'll probably want to rebind them.   - The story, although really enjoyable overall, gets a bit cliche toward the end and I found myself beginning to pick holes in it, which ruined the immersion somewhat.    CONS    - Enemy AI just isn't that bright at times.  - Controls when playing with a mouse and keyboard seem a little clumsy. Sometimes you'll randomly miss zip wires and jumps for no reason. I feel like this is a product of the game being exclusive to Xbox initially.  - Definitely some bugs around. I found one type of craftable explosive to be paticularly buggy. As one example, n the final boss battle, it exploded next to the boss, who then just disappeared through the floor meaning I had to reload.   ",

            "review_text": "For me this is probably contender for GOTY.   If you loved the previous Tomb Raider reboot, you will most likely love this even more. Personally, I think Crystal Dynamics has somehow pulled off improving on basically every facet of the game in this sequel.  I have seen some people commenting that they think the writting/story is worse in the sequel. I guess you could say that the story is somewhat similar, but yes this is a sequel in a franchise, can you really complain that it has Lara raiding Tombs and there is some crazy fanatical maniacs trying to kill you? If you are looking for a drastically different story, you are looking for another game series...  In terms of gameplay, I don't want to spoil it, but they have added a few game mechanics that do improve the gameplay loop further. While the previous game was about Lara's birth as the character, this one really makes you feel like the full blown Tomb Raider. I don't know why Uncharted 4 is so well regarded, I guess it does have pretty great story and visuals (for PS4), but in my opinion it just cannot compete with RoTR on gameplay. Paritcularly I have always found shooting in Uncharted to be unfuriating garbage (maybe its just having to aim with joysticks), but RoTR combat just feels more dynamic and actually makes me feel like a ruthless killer rather than a clumsy (wisecracking) idiot. Also, as I progress through the game, I keep finding new mechanics that are similar to the new ones in Uncharted 4, but almost always I find that Crystal Dynamics have pulled off something that is more fun/engaging. Even climbing I would say is more fun here, which I have always found to be a mandatory chore in Uncharted. But this is all probably pretty subjective.  In terms of graphics, I am playing this on 4K on Ultra with a gtx 1080 at about 40 fps. The game looks simply amazing, probably the only thing I have seen it rival is Crysis 3. When I moved to 4K, I felt like a lot of games just simply did not hold up, because the greater resolution just made the lack of detail just more evident. RoTR definately holds up, and there are many times where I just stop dead in my tracks and admire the view.  Is this game worth full price: heck yes. It makes me sad how entitled gamers have grown with the quality and amount of content they get for $60. This game has several dozen hours of content, some of the most advanced graphics and tech, a detailed story with engaging gameplay and cost &gt;$100m to make. And if you are looking for this type of experience, Uncharted 4 is really the only other contender. When you look at it that way, how can you argue that the game is worth less than a t-shirt or a ticket to a 2 hour movie...",

            "review_text": "MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS/READ AT YOUR OWN RISK  Since I finished the game (100% minus DLC and currently exploring the expedition modes), I still feel secure in recommending it to both longtime fans and newcomers. It's a good game in its own way for people who don't know or aren't as knowledgeable of Lara Croft's journey in the game industry, but imo it's not quite what it could be for diehard fans. Don't get me wrong, I very much enjoyed ROTR more than the reboot; it's just still lacking in certain areas that - based on the improvement thus far - I'm mostly confident they'll, well, fix for a lack of better words.  For starters, they captured the sense of adventure better than the reboot by providing better incentives to explore the land as well as expanding said area. Aside from collecting resources, collectibles (ugh), and challenges (double ugh), there's the bonus of a group of people you can interact with who give you missions to carry out. This, on top of the newly designed challenge tombs, makes the world feel more alive through the past and the present. It definitely helps that the entire game is more colorful and vivid than the dull colored maps of the reboot.  As for the action, they added a few more mechanics to spice up the combat a bit. There's an array of weapons to choose from rather than one weapon that's either swapped for a better one or upgraded to look different, and most of the weapons now have specially crafted ammo. In addition to this, they've added on the move crafting to allow different approaches to combat encounters; you can now craft throwables to either damage or distract, both of which can also be upgraded to do more damage or add damage respectively. There are more skills as well, but quite a few of them were hit or miss for me. All this combined with an enhanced survival instinct that allows you to see when an enemy is in view of another gives way for better stealth tactics if that tickles your fancy. I mostly played the game in this manner on the seasoned raider difficulty, so I don't know if that affects my opinion differently, but I'm almost tempted to say that the game seems to push for stealth more than guns blazing - which brings me to my next point.  The game unfortunately still went with the endless amount of men trying to kill one female, and I'll never understand why. This isn't a SJW or feminist point, this is from the standpoint of a longtime fan who wishes to see more adventure and puzzle solving than an illogical one woman army. It literally kills me inside when even the game acknowledges this with its 'oh so witty' comments from said men who can't believe they're getting their asses kicked by Lara Croft. Yes, Lara Croft is a badass but she's a badass because of her intellect more than her ability to kill someone or something. In all the TR games she has killed to survive, but this just feels so forced.  That being said, the puzzles could use more difficulty still. I remember reading an article about how the devs were going to bring back nested puzzles, which they did for the most part, but then they turned around and said they didn't want to make them but so difficult that it would turn players away. I could understand that mentality back when Tomb Raider was first established because players still relied on physical guides or perseverance to get by, but in today's world where in less than a minute you can google the solution if you get stuck, I will never buy that as an excuse to not make your players think. I think there was only one puzzle that took me a second to figure out, and that was only because I got confused about one of the objects and how it was used. I also wish the puzzles existed outside of the challenge tombs.  Quick note about said tombs, I can't express enough how much better they are visually. They're just grand and take the appearance of settings from the likes of Tomb Raider I-III with today's graphics. Though they could use some diversity of the physical secret discovered, they did a superb job nevertheless. The rewards gained are actually worth the raid even if the tombs are still optional.  Last but certainly not least - the plot. It was certainly more compelling than the reboot in that the main enemy is more than a title; there's a backstory, there's emotion, there's a reason why that unfolds and intertwines with Lara's story. I can't say anything was truly shocking, but at least it's not Mathias...a potato is better than Mathias as an enemy. If it wasn't for my need to explore everything, the game would probably be short, so I guess that's a bit of a problem. I long for the days of, as another reviewer put it, globetrotting; I'm pretty sure if there were multiple countries with these kinds of maps the game would be much longer and have more depth but it doesn't seem Crystal Dynamics wants to put that kind of effort into it. The fact that they pretty much recycled the supernatural enemies (yay more undead men /s) and the final climb from the reboot speaks volumes of what kind of effort they put into the plot. I've seen some minor complaints about the overarching enemy, but since I grew up with Natla constantly having a vendetta against Lara it doesn't bother me as long as it's planned out well.  Performance wise, the game worked fine for me. My recent boot up of the game, during a loading screen, it crashed for the first time. There's a few moments where my fps will drop from the 60's-50's to the 30's and one time even 15 fps, other than that the game ran smooth. I have a gtx 780, a locked i5, and 16gb of ram so most of my settings were set to high/very high, and I refused to compromise on the pure hair at least being on because it looked weird off.  As I said, overall it's a good game. There's still room for improvement but it's already quite the upgrade over the reboot. Buy it when you can!  P.S: What happened to Croatia? AND WHERE ARE MY DOUBLE PISTOLS???",

Getting between 50-60 FPS with VSync enabled in game and Adaptive VSync in NVCP. Still can't enable the sexy hair so it still looks like a tornado is following Laura off camera.   This update litterally added 10 to 15 fps right out of the gate with DX12 enabled. DX12 is bad ♥♥♥ if the developer is willing to get it's hands dirty. DX12 isn't about new features like previous DX versions and more about optimization possabilities so it will always be a mixed bag.  Great to see Nixxis and/or Square Enix supporting the PC like this! We'll buy your games if you fix your crappy ports and you did!!!

Crystal Dynamics stepped up their game in the graphics department. The game looks absolutely stunning, especially in the cutscenes but also while normal gameplay. Thanks to motion capturing, insanely high end models and highres textures the characters look very lifelike and feel beyond real. The areas each have an unique feel to them and are very detailed. Only downside are the resulting fps, especially in some outside areas.  I also really enjoyed the story since it's solid, fun to follow and the characters feel authentic. Scattered around the map are countless letters and audiologs to find which tell tales of long gone individuals, like the man who chased the prophet. It felt very rewarding finding a new part of his story every now and then, since it also gives you more insight into the current storyline itself.  The gameplay recieved some upgrades as well, so it's even more fun to explore the relatively open maps, climb mountains, hunt for animal loot and decide for yourself which quests you want to do next. The game rewards you for exploring the area by finding weapon parts to unlock new weapons, single weapon accessories and so on. Gathering ressources enables you to modify weapons, improving their respective stats. By leveling up while playing and collecting stuff you can unlock skills which improve various general and weapon specific aspects of Lara, which is also rewarding.  The game offers at least 20 hours of gameplay without looking for all the collectibles. At this point I played it 25 hours and reached overall progress of 86%, so there are many more collectibles to find  I highly recommend Rise of the Tomb Raider. It's a must buy!",

While it was interesting to see them give a spin to old Russian myths, I didn't see the point of the Byzantine subplot, combat was so well made, that in the end the game's 'challenges' are simply banal and easy to solve (although difficulty in Tomb Raider has never been in it's enemies, but in it's puzzles) sometimes during stealth you can shoot a guy in front of you with the bow and he will do the skyrim thing of searching for you for like 2 seconds and return to his post...  All in all I recommend it to the fans, specially if it is on sale. due to it's gameplay, The Baba Yaga DLC is also funny, but not a necessity and you don't lose anything from not playing it.",

The optional missions even though some of them were fetch quests I felt in some way they actually complemented the story.

Crafting is much more enhanced and there are now many resources available to collect and farm, really enhances the survial aspect of the game. The tombs are also MUCH MUCH better than the reboot, more complex, challenging and worth exploring. The game actually deserves to be called Tomb Raider now.  - Graphics...OMG  - replayability. The reboot suffered from a lack of replayability IMO. Instead of giving us a mediocre multiplayer, CD made the right call by giving us several new SP modes that greatly enhanced replayability. I really love the 'card' features of the game that allow you to replay the game or just a chapter with modifiers, for example you can replay a chapter with maxed out gears and try it on the highest difficulty. There are also player created missions with different objectives.  - Finally there is the Endurance mode (which, unfortunately, is sold separately for 10$). If you like a survival type of game mode that desperately tries to get you killed you will love this (Frostfall in Skyrim anyone?). The game basically gives you a small openworld to roam around, but different from the main game, Lara has a warmth and hunger meter that will decrease with time. You need to hunt and create/find fire to keep yourself alive, while trying to find relics in ruins and crypts and fight off/elude enemies. The slogan of 'woman vs the wild' truly comes to life and shines in this mode.   cons - the game is VERY VERY demanding. If you enjoy playing games on high/max settings with smooth performance, but doesn't have a high end PC, FORGET ABOUT PLAYING THE GAME, at least for now. You would be better off playing this on XBONE. The game seems to be very unoptimized for PC, or just unusually demanding. So many people with 980 and even 980Ti are complaning of FPS dips. The game consumes a whooping 6.1 GB of VRAM in 1080P at max settings!  I'm NOT saying that you shouldn't buy the game if you don't have the high-end gears. The game will be playable on even lower-end PC, but just note that you WILL suffer performance issues. You've been warned!  - Apparently a lot of people are experiencing stability and crashing issue. So beware of that... - microtransactions for the expedition cards. It's pretty slow to earn in-game credits that are used to buy the cards that modify the game. The game is still perfectly playable without the cards. But it's clear that the devs intentionally made earning $ a lot harder so people will feel enticed by the microtransactions.",

The graphics, presentation, narrative, characters, gameplay and voice-acting has all been top-notch! Not only that, but for the price that it is for all the content you get (Main game + DLC + Season Pass), I'll say right now that if Action-Adventure coupled with good story telling in your thing, then BUY THIS GAME.  One of my biggest concerns with the prequel was that I felt they handled Lara's development haphazardly; I found that Lara was thrust into nigh on impossible situations too early on within the story, not allowing for a gradual build-up of her experience. I won't go into the details, but suffice to say a weakened human being would be highly unlikely to suffice the events she found herself in, though I understand with such games/stories a lot of this is done to drive the plot and make the gameplay engaging. Otherwise, for a reboot I found it to be an extremely well-designed title and my hats off to Crystal Dynamics for not only doing the franchise justice but also for creating a sequel that goes beyond my expectations.  I'll allow others to experience for themselves what this game is like, but I'll say this much; every system and gameplay mechanic has been substantially improved for this title, and really hammers home the idea of survival.  The only problem I have with this iteration is the use of the Q key/Survival Instincts, which is too prevelant. Sure, you don't have to use it, but it's functionality is so ingrained into the game's mechanics (enemy positions, resources, extras) and necessary for some essential parts (objects can be blended too well with the environment). I think it's a cop-out when developers do this, and honestly it's just a cheap way of making the game more accessible. Furthermore, as far as I'm concerned if you have to implement such a feature in the first place then they've not done a good job adding these elements to the game in the first place. The recent Batman titles did the same thing with X-ray vision, and I feel it just distracts from the experience.  Overall, a worthy successor to the reboot and entry to the franchise.

I really enjoy the story behind it, the challenges that you have to go through, there are multiple puzzles to solve and a lot more. I would also recommend buying a season pass for this game since you get extra modes and an expansion to the gameplay which is really interesting. But the only thing about the season pass is that you get outfits for Lara that you can already craft in the game. So, instead of purchasing the entire season pass, I'd recommend getting the expansion or the endurance mode.  Purchasing this game was a satisfaction for me since I really love playing Tomb Raider, but you'll enjoy the most out of this game by, high resolution gameplay, challenges that Lara goes through and a really interesting story of the game as well.

And the reason I tolerate this, I think, is because the sacrifice of logic is made to be worth it with exhilerating moments of engagement in the story. I feel what Lara is feeling when something goes wrong with my only plan, and I'm left with no apparent options, I feel trapped even though I'm not, but Lara is, and suddenly I find a solution, and it feels like a miracle. Experiencing the miracles are what redeems the logical falacies, and trapping nature of linear games. Just based on this I would recommend this game, but there are some things that may make some of you hesitate in buying it, and I'd like to warn you of those.   The most noteworthy is the grinding required to aquire certain things. This warning is only for those of you who happen to not want to perform genocide on wildlife that is nearly equatable in magnitude to the holocaust in order to attain the best bow, rifle, pistol, or shotgun upgrades for any or all of the variants of these weapons. I say this because the crafting requirements for weapon upgrades often requires many resources from animals. To be fair you can go through the game without destroying local ecosystems because the weapon upgrades are not entirely necessary, but if you are a perfectionest with a conscience you may be putting yourself into a terrible predicament by playing this game.  The other reason you may not want to buy this game is because you won't get much time out of it. Like I said it's a linear game so there's not much replayability to be had, and all the game has to offer to keep you engaged after you have finished the story is a thing called expeditions, which basically allows you to repeat specific parts of the story with arcade-like challenges. I find these boring, and I don't think they are good enough to maintain my interest in the game. I finished the story in about 19 hours, but you may finish the game in less if you don't get caught up in slaughtering the wildlife, so if you think &lt;19 hours of a great story is worth 60 dollars minus 1 cent then I recommend you get this game, if not wait for a sale, or just don't buy it.",

This one is very similar to the previous 2013 release, so if you liked that you'll enjoy this one.   I really had fun with this game, the tombs are fun to raid and the enviroment is really beautiful and fun to explore, the shooting feels solid enough, although the pistol is as useless as the previous game once you get a silencer for the rifle.  The writing is ok, the story isn't as interesting as the previous game in my opinion, but I enjoyed what they tried to show in it.  Overall I'd recommend it just for the fun factor, there's a lot to do in the game too, so you'll get a lot of money/time if you value that sort of thing too.",

Only better  -And I must admit, I didn't think all those crafting mechanics will work throughout the game and surprisingly I was wrong. It was truly beneficial  -Music is not 10/10 but still good  -First boss was a fricking   BEAR   And I liked it.  -Optional Tombs. They are beautiful. They are not easy to reach. BUT...(keep reading)  -Hunting is something now.    Cons   -The title  'Rise of the Tomb Raider'  felt like an another origin story/prequel. And actually it was. Not in a bad way but after completing the story, you want to play more because all of that was just a beginning of something. And we all know that we won't be seeing any new TR title in like 3 more years, best. I hope I am wrong  - Fast travel system is more usable than  TR 2013  but game is still linear af. Why bother making it sandbox? Because sandbox titles sell more?   -I can't decide what is off with motion capture, either it is too good that we are not used to it so it kinda looks new and weird OR it just tries too much and fails(rarely tho). Maybe it is just me guys  -Optional Tombs were fun but easy. Sorry.    Crystal Dynamics: Thanks for another great game. You guys rock! The title is pretty much one of the best looking game on the market and true representative of the 'Next Gen' I really enjoyed playing as a strong female character who is super sexy(I mean, that accent right?) yet still doesn't rely on her appeal at all.",

            "review_text": "So, I wanted to beat this before I wrote a review. When I finished, I had completed roughly 70% of the content. I missed a few of the tombs, but saw enough to know what they were like, and some of the weapon components.  All in all, this was a solid game, but not something I would recommend buying at full price for two reasons: 1) There isn't all that much gameplay to be had and 2) Though it's well done, there's nothing life-changing here. The most I'd pay, if I could do it again, is 40 dollars.  This is a nonexhaustive review, I listed the things that I've most commonly seen commented on and anything that jumped out at me.  TLDR: Good graphics, but mundane setting. Decent story, but a bit short. Average overall mechanics (crafting, combat). Enjoyed my time played, but less than the former title. Though i recommend it, I would not pay more than 40 dollars.  Pros:  - Graphics. The graphics are extremely well done. There is a lot of polish, nothing too clunky (the occasional visual glitch)  - Tombs. Tombs were pretty solid; simple enough that they wouldn't totally frustrate you, but not so mindlessly easy that they had no value.  - Story. This would probably be more appropriately listed in the 'neutral' category. I didn't find the story particularly thrilling. It was extremely straightforward, there were not any exciting twists. However, it was good enough to keep me playing and did not detract from my experience at all. Given that I wanted to see how it ended, even though the end was predictable, I suppose I have to consider it a 'pro'. Though, I'll finish a terrible book just to validate my own opinion, so this might not be a legitimate criterion to use.   Neutral:  - I found the gathering/crafting to be fairly mundane. There are a lot of different supplies to collect throughout your journey, but all recipes are standard: X, Y, Z, press button, new item. It did not detract from my experience, but - other than the weapons - it did not add much either. Given that the crafting felt like an afterthought, the game could have benefitted from fewer crafting components (I cannot believe I'm typing this). I spent a fair amount of time collecting things and killing random animals, but still could not craft a lot of items because I was frequently missing a component. Again, this did not hurt the experience, but it did not improve it either; it's possible I would have felt a greater sense of achievement if I were able to craft some of the items more easily. Either way, it probably does not really matter.  - Combat was average to me. I have read a lot of reviews that think it was better than the last Tomb Raider, but I don't understand why. The combat itself played the same, with a few minor changes. There was significantly less of it, which seems to be why people prefer combat in this game more than in the last. The reason I disliked it is because it was so damn scripted. Maybe a tomb raider game shouldn't have a lot of combat, but the reduction resulted in a gameplay style of: explore for awhile, cut scene, scripted encounter; explore for awhile, cut scene, scripted encounter. For me, it felt entirely too forced.  Cons:  - The setting. Graphically, I found the game mesmerizing. Unfortunately, the setting rarely gives the graphical depth a chance to shine. Most of your time is spent in a colorless, snowy scenery. Don't get me wrong, I love the snow, but there are only so many shades of white before it all just looks the same. When I finally made it to a setting with color, I was blown away. Sadly, very little of your time is spent in areas where the graphics truly get to show off.   - Linear. This might not be the best way to describe this, because there is definitely room for exploration. However, much of this game just felt too linearly scripted for me. You frequently bump into 'gates' (ie haven't unlocked an item that you gain access to later) that break up immersion. Initially, it did not bother me much. I figured, 'well, that's realistic, I guess'. Unfortunately, it happened so frequently while I randomly explored that eventually it dissuaded me from continuing to explore. Not necessarily the game's fault as some of that is of my own volition. The game doesn't do itself any favors in this category, though.",

I'd describe it as VERY HIGH settings with the exception of one or two parameters. This game comes into its own where the alst one failed miserably: multiplayer.

So please just bear with me and read this through.  My setup: GPU: GTX 760 TWIN FROZR OC 2GB CPU: AMD FX 8320 RAM: 12 GB  I'm running this game smoothly, the only times i get a bit of an FPS DROP is when the screen get's really close to Lara's face. As the hair and face are gorgeous (As expected) But since you do not get close to the face when really IN-GAME, but more between the cutscenes and the gameplay (during this transition of around 3-5 seconds) I do not mind the little to non FPS DROPS.  I have the game ready driver installed.  HERE ARE IS THE REVIEW OF THE GAME ITSELF.  Rise of the Tomb Raider is a great game that has got some INSANE rendering up it's sleeve. (The areas are BEAUTIFUL). The story is really like a Tomb Raider game should be. The sound is AMAZING, I'm currently using a 7.1 Headset and It's just to good i can't describe it. The game runs smoothly and with little to no problems/bugs (Atleast I have not encountered any yet)  I give this game a 9.5 out of 10: Because there were some small hiccups with the FPS at a certain time but nothing game breaking.  I really recommend this game to anyone that loves the Tomb Raider series.  Here's why: - Great Performance - Beautiful scenery - Story is Great - Sound is amazing (I REALLY ♥♥♥♥ING LOVE IT)  I got it with the 10% off so I paid 44.99€ But if you have the money you should definitely BUY this game eventhough it might not be on sale for you at the time.

Where most AAA games do one thing really well, or lots of things mediocre, this one is somewhere in the middle and does several things really well: -Great story (I watched it on youtube when it originally came out, I haven't beaten it myself yet) -Great stealth -Great survival / crafting -Great gunplay -Great secondary modes. Endurance / survival / time attacks etc. The usual feature set found in a lot of games these days, but done with polish and balance.  Final thought: I'm glad I waited for the 'complete' game rather than buying it and all the DLC separate, but now that the game is finished it should be at the top of the list for any fan of the genre.",

On the higher difficulties it's actually a challenge now, the firefights are very strategic and satisfying and plenty of tombs to uncover. Be warned though it's like Crysis, you need an incredibly powerful rig to run it once you get to the lost city stages. My frame rate on an r290 fluctuates wildly from 60fps down to the teens on the high setting and tessellation set to 8x in crimson control panel, playing only 1080p. This is with the latest beta driver. I thoroughly disagree with the reviewers who say there's not much difference between the quality settings, there is a gulf. If you have the rig to run this congrats, I thought meeting the recommended specs was enough but it's sadly not at least on AMD. A g-sync or free-sync monitor is recommended to address the frame rate fluctuations. I am hoping they can add further optimisations to the frame rate because it really struggles in parts. Can consume up to 7gb of video ram on highest texture settings, even on high it's saturated my r290 4GB buffer. But boy it can look beautiful.  Update: I have updated this section now that I have tested the latest AMD Driver 15.3.1 and the new Patch which both support DirectX 12. This game is incredibly single core heavy in DirectX 11 mode, even an overclocked FX processor (my 8320 is running @ 4.7Ghz) is not fast enough to smoothly run this game. However with the DirectX12 support now added, the game spreads the load evenly across all the cores eliminating the large frame rate fluctuations. Coupled with AMD's optimisations and the game can easily hold 50fps just about all the time and closes in on the golden 60fps on the default High game setting at 1080p. There are still a few demanding areas but these drop to the 40s instead of the teens now so they aren't are noticable unless you are looking for them.  The future of AMD and DirectX 12 looks quite rosy ;)",

All in all this game is quite beautiful, the acting is perfect and definitely worth every penny. I can't wait for the next Tomb Raider, the plot's not bad either but I preferred the one from the previous tomb raider. Still a great game with lots of quality, I beat it for a second time just a few days ago after beating it first on february 2016 and it still was fun to spend time on.

PC performance review.  My rig is an i7 4790 @ 3.6 GHz, 12 GB DDR3 1600, GTX 960 SSC 2GB, 750 Watt Corsair PSU.  High preset, with FXAA, 1080p, tripple buffering, very high details, HBAO +.  I get a nice playable 40 fps in areas without a lot of stuff going on, but still a decent amount of 'stuff'.  In intensive areas, I get 30 fps and it does not go bellow 30 fps. So the game is really quite a playable experience.  Now onto game play. Controlls are very solid, no bugs that I have seen.  My only issue is that sprinting can be a bit of a pain, it could be better because it does not always respond right if your not on the ground in a stable area. Kind of hard to explain.  Upgrading your tools and weapons is nice and easy. The outfits are pretty cool, but why the hell is the outfit tab under weapons? Really? Thats sexist. Back to serious, the outfits are pretty nice and some have bonuses, like faster regen.    Story is amazing. Plenty of twists and turns to keep you surprised. I was only able to predict one plot twist, so GG game.  The characters feel real and not un killable. Watch to the end of the credits - cough cough- Lara Croft is a mature women now. She does not cry over the evils she witnesses, and the people she kills.    Tombs in this game are hard, and that is a good thing.    To sum up Rise of the Tomb Raider is a great game, and refines the Tomb Raider formula.   9/10.  EDIT:  Since the launch of the game, the DLC have added much to the increase the total amount of playtime you can get from it.",

            "review_text": "Following the very enjoyable Tomb Raider reboot in 2013 I must admit many tears were shed when Square Enix announced that the follow up game would only be available on the Xbox. Sadly for kleenex share prices this lunacy did not last for long as the accountants had a quiet word in the shell-like ears of the marketing guys and explained that this was the worst idea since someone said 'yeah let's take this suspiciously large horse into Troy, statues are all the rage this season'.  However after my experience pre-ordering Arkham Knight, my anticipation was a little muted and I have held off on buying Rise of the Tomb Raider until a few days ago. After playing the game, my trepidation has proven to have been somewhat unfounded, though not enough for me to ever consider pre-ordering a game again (once bitten and what not).  So how does RotTR stand up compared to it's 2013 predecessor? Quite well actually, it's pretty enjoyable. It feels like a progression and there are definite improvements from the first installment. You have alot more weapons to choose from, and rather than weapon types being upgraded you now have the option to select the paticular type of pistol, bow, shotgun and rifle you want to equip. So if you are going huntng, you'll want to equip the powerful bolt rifle which will kill most animals with just one well place shot, but if you are entering into a fire fight with a half dozen or more enemies you need to think about equipping a machine gun with a much larger magazine (something that caught me out on my first play through). Also included are improvised weapons that can be crafted from jerry cans, bottles, baked bean tins, walkie talkies and chickens (yes you read that right) which can then be thrown at enemies or left as booby traps which is a nice touch. The skill trees have been enlarged and improved and affect how you choose to (or even can) play the game. Now each time you level up, you can choose to focus on skills that will give you an advantage if stealth is your prefered option, conversely if you like running into a room gung-ho all guns blazing there are skills available to help with that too. Another improved aspect to RotTR is the tombs, they are better hidden and once you are there they will take a bit more figuring out that in the TR reboot, so you get more of a sense of achievement when you reach your goal. And finally for the pros are the different outfits available, they now serve a purpose rather than just being aesthetic as many will come with bonuses that will help Lara through her quest  What I would say though is that this game does have a couple of issues. Now I am a big fan of the Assassin's Creed and Arkham franchises and enjoyed the Tomb Raider reboot as much as the first game from those two series. I was hoping that RotTR would be to TR what Arkham City was to Arkham Assylum. It is though more along the lines of what AC IV: Black Flag was to ACIII. Now don't get me wrong, I have got many hours of fun out of AC III &amp; IV, but they felt like very similar games apart from a few small improvements from III to IV (the sea battles and buliding of your fleet of ships for example). For all of the improvements of gear and tombs, this is something that RotTR also suffers from. The main antagonist felt very familiar, as did parts of the landscape. Certain levels looked and felt like I had gone through them before in the prequel and all of the enemies felt like a rehash of those who were in Lara's way in the reboot, even the 'plot twists' you can see coming from a mile off. All of which was more than a little dissapointing.  Minor quibbles aside though, this is another good installment of the tales of Lara Croft and I reccomend that anyone who played the reboot and enjoyed it should get this also as they will have fun scaling rock walls, skulking through gulags, hunting wolves and blowing up helicopters. I look forwards to the next installment.  A solid 8/10 game.",

If you loved the last game 'Tomb Raider' and the way the reboot went then you will love this game too.  Shame it's gamesworks this time around which, as usual, screws people's performance on the highest settings. This game needs optimisation still for when it is loading from the drive but most people's performance will be tanking because of Nvidia's usual BS.  So turn tessellation right down in your driver settings and turn off the HBAO+ to restore most of the performance dips. You will still get some stuttering when it is loading in this version 1.0 early build. This is because I only have 8GB of RAM and it is using the windows pagefile. Make sure you have your pagefile on an SSD, if you have one, when you are running less than 16GB of RAM. Otherwise do as I suggest and your performance will be mostly fine with everything else on max.  I am running an FX-8120 and a 7950 and I am getting a pretty solid 40-50 fps from the steam counter.  EDIT: Ok so I got to the 3rd part called 'Soviet Installation' and my frame rate tanked. I had to drop from 'very high' to 'high' texture detail. I'm guessing I ran out of VRAM cause that's all it took to bump my frame rate right back up again and I couldn't notice any difference at all at 1080p. I suspect 'v high' textures are just badly compressed. This game sure is punishing on hardware... but it sure is beatuiful.",

With an ever growing array of things that Lara is able to do it is pure enjoyment for those who like this kind of game. I have to say that towards the end things became a little repetitive (challenges) but regardless I really enjoyed the story, something that is often lacking from modern games.  Technically is an outstanding achievement with high spec graphics giving you gorgeous visuals. In fact I came back to finish this game because I scored a 32' 4K UHD IPS screen paired with a GTX1080 and the visuals so impressed me I started playing games again in general. This one I particularly enjoyed. Watching Lara climbing a wall in 4K is enchanting. Her shivering in the cold was particularly well done and provided some grit.   I enjoy a good story and I was not disappointed. With multiple characters and a strong story arc it is something we have come to expect from the franchise and we have not been let down. While I found Lara a bit too fragile for my liking it was interesting and somewhat engaging. I can't quite put my finger on it but for some reason I wasn't cheering Lara on. I was more watching her with an observers eye as I couldn't really empathise with her as I would have thought.  The deaths were many, as you would expect learning how to do things usually involved a fall or two. The gruesome way they were detailed is something new to this reboot. I am not really sure I like it that much. While it adds an element of the macabre it pulls me out of the moment. Does everything have to result in immediate death? Maybe this is just a way to avoid having an impairment system which I feel would be more realistic to the story.  Overall it is a tremendous achievement. A balls to the wall romp through and adventure where death awaits around every corner. Beautifully detailed and technically excellent I can't help but recommend this game to others.    ",

Usually, the second part to a game that comes out 'quickly' is bound to be bad or not live up to the expectations. This one however, took my expectations to a romantic dinner and proceeded to **** them all night long. That's how good this game was.  Compared to the first game this one is 10 times better. It's longer, there's more side quests (not that many though) and there's tons of little things to explore that add up to the lore of the game a little bit. I still haven't collected all the little things in the game or checked out the other game modes but I will soon enough :) Graphics are extremely good and the game is well optimized. They even added DirectX 12 support as of today which does absolutely nothing to my performance but whatever, it might work wonders for others lol.  Overall this is a very solid game and great port.

I do feel that the game is more meant to be played on a controller as most of the times I died, was because I fell during the jumps from one ledge to the other and that's cause of the camera angle that changes in some scenes and you can move the caracter a lot in the air, so using a controller will surely help with that.  And the graphics is some of the best!!!! You may need a GTX 980 Ti or GTX1070 to max out the graphics settins for 1080p gaming as my GTX980 just couldn't max the settings @ 1920x1080.

Endurance mode only if you're into the survival aspect of the game and want to experience more of that. All others DLC are cosmetic, aswell as a zombie mode which I'm personally not interested in.",

The graphics have also been amped up and the game world looks remarkable, problem is the game is haunted by bad optimization. Constant frame drops and freezing cutscenes and the occasional crash to desktop. The overall experience is great, but these frame drops which can get as bad as 20fps are absurd. Though my PC doesn't meet the highest requirements, I had the settings dropped a little with no anti-aliasing, textures as medium and some other settings dropped down a bit too, such as shadows and soft lighting switched to off.  But aside from the game performing funky on the technical side of things, the gameplay is solid, with what seems like fewer quick time events in the overall story, but sadly still make up a portion of the already arbitrary and ridiculous final boss fight which doesn't have you use any of the skills save for two. A boss fight should always be a TEST of your skills and NOT a contrived segment to 'wrap things up.'  Pros: -Built on the mechanics of the reboot -Beautiful graphics -Great environment -Polished gameplay -More tomb puzzles -The Baba-Yaga dlc is amusing  Cons: -The plot is contrived, boring and overall predictable and cliche -Even Laura seems to have lost some personality here -The amount of collectables is utterly ridiculous -The overall story is quite short -Half the puzzles are hardly even challenging  I'm just barely recommending this game, as it's not worth the $60(USD) price tag. Get this game on sale and you'll be more pleased for the price. I will say, running the game with DirectX 12 support (from the graphics options, in game) does seem to improve performance for people who have GPU's capable of supporting DX12.

The previous game already had too much, but the amount was somewhat manageable. Now it's just so much that it severely obstructs and distracts you from the main game. Folks who were hoping for a cinematic experience will be quite annoyed by all this filler that can be found pretty much everywhere you look. If you haven't played the reboot, go play that as it's both better and cheaper.  The only thing this game does better than the previous one is the optional Tombs, which are pretty fun puzzles. The graphics are better as well, though they're quite demanding and don't appear to be optimized as well as the reboot was (not that the reboot didn't have it's launch issues).",

I picked the first up on the playstation during a sale because i didn't know if i'd like this 'new lara'... By the time this game was announced i was already excited for it.  Day One purchase for me, I don't regret it.  Glad to see Max Settings + 4K is rather easily achievable as well. This is a very well optimized title.  120FPS @ Very High - 1080p 40-50 @ Very High - 4K  I haven't gotten too far into the story at the moment but from what i've seen, its very interesting and has lovely environments. It still feels very 'Uncharted' but I suppose Uncharted borrowed from Tomb Raider in the first place. It feels like an amazing evolution of the franchise. I hope they release a third title as well.   9/10 - Would recommend.",

            "review_text": "In a nutshell, the Rise of the Tomb Raider is a logical continuation of the 2013 Tomb Raider, and plays very much like its predecessor, but with many small enhancements to the formula. If you enjoyed the previous Tomb Raider, you'll definitely like this one as well.  I loved the visuals, the environment was absolutely gorgeous with detailed animations and beautiful art design. Facial motion capture really brought cutscenes to the next level, and the significantly improved lighting seals the deal to make this one of the best looking role-playing titles to date.  The game has noticeably more to explore this time around, and many more actual tombs to solve. I was surprised by the variety of tombs that the game had to offer; no two were alike, yet all presented a fun and reasonable challenge. Also a tip of the hat to Crystal Dynamics for not walling off parts of the game behind DLC. There is a season pass available, but the crucial thing is that the game has plenty of content and feels complete without it.  The game mechanics are very similar to the previous Tomb Raider. Cover-based combat and stealth approaches once again give the player multiple ways to play the game. The climbing, shooting, and loot collecting are smooth as clockwork, and the enhanced crafting system now allows you to craft ammo on the run.  I do however have a few gripes with this game. It is undoubtably very good, but not quite 'great' in my opinion. The thing that bothered me the most is the lackluster writing. If you finish the game and think about it for a minute, you might notice that some aspects don't really make sense. Without spoiling the story, I'll just say that the 'guardians' of the 'treasure' have no real reason to treat Lara and the bad guys differently if their true goal is to keep the 'treasure' hidden at all costs. I was a bit surprised by a plot twist late in the game, but other than that, most of it was quite predictable.   Lastly, I would like to mention that in order to experience this game in all its visual glory, you will need a bit of power in your rig. It is a demanding title, but in my opinion not unoptimized. I played through the game maxed out at 1080p(with FXAA), and was able to maintain a smooth 60FPS most of the time with a GTX 980 and i5 4670K, but my framerates did drop into the 40FPS range in large and open environments.  I'm generally a sucker for good graphics and eye candy, but I do value a good story. For the Rise of the Tomb Raider, my final verdict is a solid 'B+', and I would recommend this game to those who might enjoy an RPG with a blend of action and puzzles.",

Great graphics, although performance was a little shaky on launch, especially in the hub areas of the Soviet base and the Geothermal Valley. Thankfully the framerates appear to be much better in those areas. The crafting system was neat, I liked being able to make different types of ammo and explosives. The weapon upgrade system was good, the only thing I didn't like was the fact that you couldn't remove weapon mods like the first one, although having multiple weapon types made up for it. Haven't tried much of the challenge system with the cards so I can't comment on that. Story was ok, nothing amazing but kept me immersed all the same. Reading the lore was pretty enjoyable though. This seems like a weird criticism but I thought this game was a little less 'brutal' than the 2013 reboot. Death scenes are still gruesome, but not as shocking as the first game. I know, that's such a weird thing to notice, but I thought it was kinda innovative, a huge AAA reboot that managed to be pretty graphically violent. It just seemed kinda novel when I played it. This makes sense in a way, Lara is much more experienced as an adventurer now, so the world doesn't seem quite as violent as TR13, where literally everything was trying to kill you. Still, something I thought to mention.   Oh, being able to stealth around was great too. There were a lot more options to combat than just hide behind cover and shoot, which I thought was great. It was fun running on the rooftops sniping people with the bow or jumping on top of them.   Overall a pretty good game.",

            "review_text": "Having played through Rise of the Tomb Raider on xbox one upon release and thoroughly enjoying it I can safely say that I'm thrilled that its come to PC so quickly. Had I known the wait for the PC release would be a mere few months rather than say the best part of a year or so I would've held out for sure.   System Spec: Skylake i5 6600k 3.5 ghz  Asus Strix GTX 960 2GB  16GB DDR4 RAM 2133mhz   As mentioned earlier however the xbox one version was certainly no slouch and is still actually very impressive to look at alongside the PC version which leads me to discuss the game's scalability. From the outset you're going to need at least a mid to high end gaming PC to get the job done to any degree of satisfaction. The low settings do indeed take a drastic dip in quality and lag behind the xbox one version significantly. On medium to high settings on a modest rig like mine however you can achieve between 60 and 40 fps dependent on the situation (although I'd recommend overclocking your GPU a little at the very least). You might just be able to scrape by with your trusty 750Ti on lower settings as long as you're rocking a quad core or higher CPU as this appears to have significant bearing on the game's performance.   As a whole however despite many outlets raising concerns about performance and frame rate issues I've yet to actually encounter any myself aside from the normal dips in frame rate caused by demanding scenes or areas. I'm really quite happy with the performance even on a 2gb gtx 960.  Gameplay and atmosphere wise I really can't get enough of the game. The Siberian wilderness provides an excellent backdrop with your vision often obscured by snowy storms or dimly lit caverns however these make way to gorgeous locales such as the galleon frozen into a glacier or the sprawling vistas of snowy landscape. There are sections that mix up the snowy areas however which makes for some variety in the environments, Lara's movement and animations are slick and refined which makes the whole experience a joy to play through, enemy AI is up to snuff and requires you to constantly be thinking on your feet because they will quickly overwhelm you if you attempt to camp out and stay put in combat situations. The way the enemies behave really pushes you to make maximum use of the skills and crafting available to you.   If you're into exploration and seeking out new areas there is a plethora of interesting places to visit within the map which will often see you back tracking. However this doesn't feel like re-treading old ground rather becoming more familiar with the world which arguably increases your immersion and investment in the whole affair. It does become rather tricky to remember where exactly certain locations are however and you may often find yourself going from place to place before stumbling upon the location you were after.   As a whole however there are few faults to pick with the game aside from the common gripes found within the genre such as occasional bouts of repetitive gameplay and the plot is a bit hokey but then again in this genre I think its almost a right of passage now as far as plot goes. The acting in the game however is superb and draws you in far deeper than you might imagine.   This is one of those games that I can happily play through multiple times achieving a varied experience and simply enjoying the hell out of it for what it is.   This is one of the few games that I would actually place on that lofty 10/10 pedestal. Not that the games perfect but in my mind I found everything I wanted from the game and feel thoroughly fullfiled by the whole package. I should state that the xbox one version would probably only achieve a 9 mostly due to the PC just being able to bring out those more subtle world building elements of realism thanks to the application of 60 frames per second and the extra bells and wistles.   In closing, I have no reservations about recommending this game to anyone even at full price.",

            "review_text": "Let's face it, Tomb Raider didn't need a second reboot. 2006's Anniversary/Legend/Underworld trilogy was pretty darn good, and this is just a money-making venture.  However that doesn't make this or 2013's reboot bad games, far from it. The original was a lot of fun, beautiful, and while the ending sequence of it all being to do with weather control was a tad far-fetched, it made it no less fun.  This sequel to that manages to expand the depth of the story, and does a far better of fleshing out the characters, but performance issues and a weak final section rather diminish the overall quality.  Rise of the Tomb Raider, which, in all honesty, the original from three years ago could have been called, unless it was being literal, is a truly engaging game with breathtaking visuals including a quite stunning looking Lara who is probably the best ever cut-scene real-time rendered character ever seen in a game. It also manages to maintain the gameplay from the original while expanding the tools and general depth of side missions. There is a furious amount of depth in this game, and a furious number of side bits and bobs you can do.  The environments look...well...stunning, frankly, and while performance issues affect a couple of them, generally the areas look impeccable.  If you've played the original you'll fit into this one like a glove, but the big let down is the final section. It's big, it's long, and for all its pretty looks, it's boring to play - it's incredibly derivative and feels like a copy of the final area of the original - the boss fights are also a stroll and don't really create tension - one other review called this game easy - yes, it definitely isn't a tough game. One or two bits might see a few deaths but generally the challenge is minimal.  There is also the flaw that Lara has now become a bit superhuman. Sure, she always was, but with this reboot they've tried to make her real. Unfortunately when she flies through the air and grabs a ledge she has no right to get close to, it detracts from the realism.  The voice acting is good, even if the plot itself, while engaging, is ultimately a bit empty - there is also no reference to any characters from the original beyond Lara and Jonah who has a slightly higher than a cameo role in this.  It's a good game, very good, but that weak final section and some technical problems stop it from being truly memorable.",

The story is predictible but extremely capable of grabbing you by the nutts and not letting go until the game ends. I'm not the type of person who does every side quest or any side quests in most games but I found myself exploring every single part of this game by choice. The artwork you discover and temples are just incredible. The little letters and tapes you find scattered throughout round out the story much like bioshock infinite. I read the negative reviews and they are just great in the worst kind of way. One guy is complaining about crashes constently and his pc is likley unstable as all hell. Another guy was complaining because this game isnt optimized. I've played through the entire game on a 3570k and a gtx970 with the gpu load locked at 99% load the entire time. Its demanding because its a beautiful game. My settings are everything very high with smaa. Textures and shadows are set to high as very high textures blows past 4gb of ram and shadows at max dropped me by 10fps. With my settings, I was getting anywhere between 50-80fps.

            "review_text": "It's 'ok'.  For all the the first of the two 'reboot' Tomb Raiders by Crystal Dynamics had A LOT of things that GREATLY irked me (i.e. 100,000 quicktime events, Laura either falling from 10+ stories or getting 'captured' every 5 feet, and the plot with the other crew members playing out like a back 'slasher' film, etc.), I still found it MUCH more 'enjoyable' than this one, for the following reasons:  1) Exploration rewarded you. There was ONE map/chart per area that 'marked' the location of all the items onto your zone map. In this version, there's A LOT more 'AAA game hand-holding', and each zone has anywhere from 3-10 different things that will 'show' tiny parts of what you can find on the map. ...And if that wasn't annoying enough for you, most of the 'hey look over here' maps/charts are laid out DIRECTLY on the 'story path', so you would have needed to suffer MANY blows to the head to miss them...  2) Ironically, while the zones themselves at first impression SEEM much larger and more 'openly explorable', it's actually a facade, and they are EXTREMELY linear as far as how much you are 'allowed' to explore - you have to backtrack TONS more than in the first game after ytou reach the arbiotrary story point at which you gain the item needed to uplock more of the zone. One of the ones that irked me the most was that the tombs themselves (i.e. the fun parts of the games where all the ACTUAL 'TOmb Raide-raiding tombs puzzels' were hiding) were almost UNANIMOUSLY 'locked off' until you progressed far ebnough into the sotyline to gain the item to get inside them. What's worse is that VERY often the 'item' needed to gain entry to said tombs WASN'T EVEN THEN USED AS PART OF THE TOMB'S PUZZLE (i.e. the one that required the 'rebreather' for Laura to swim more than 10 meteres without drowning or something, cuz ya know, it's not like all that mountain climbing in thin atmosphere envirnonments woulda naturally given her a much larger lung capacity and tollerance for less oxygen! Oh wait...).  3) The actual 'Tomb Puzzles' were more 'linear' than in the last game, and I found the 'solutions' t be a lot simpler and easier to figure out as well. Now, I don't mean 'linear' in the sense of 'only one path' in this case, what I mean is that you may be carrying 5+ different things that *LOGICALLY* would have functionally solved the challenge presented to you, but ONLY the one Crystal Dynamics 'thought of' will work, so it turn into a game of 'die until I figure out how YOU want me to solve this puzzle'...  I wanna get some *special* hate on for a 'round robin boat pulling' tomb that took me EONS to 'figure out', cuz the boats themselves did not behave 'naturally' - they did not follow the current of the river, and their behavior 'changed' as soon as yopu jumped onto one of them as well (and while I was QUITE capabale of simply 'jumping' to where I needed to go FROM one of the boats, it would not let me 'ledge grab' until I was on the 'correct' boat...). I mean, what is this - a 90's adventure game!?  4) The 'coin collection' aspect of the game was TERRIBLY managed. You may have walked DFIRECTLY over the SPECIFIC location where a 'coin cache' was burried 100+ times, but until you find the SPECIFIC map/chart that TELLS you it's 'burried there', and give you a map marker for it, you can't loot them. While you could argue this means 'go fnd the maps/charts', in reality it means 'stop having fun freely exploring and progress into the story until we HAND you the map/chart along the story path where you can't miss it...).  5) The combat is basically unchanged since the first one. Sure, you can 'craft bombs' and 'switch out weapon types', but the effects of changing weapons were superficial at best, and some of the 'perks' for setting traps were COMPLETELY pointless, such as the 'turn enemy radios into proximity mines', and 'turn enemy bodies into poison traps'. I honestly got throught the ENTIRE game not getting to try either of these even ONCE (and almost ALL of my kills were 'stealth kills' as well), simply because the locations were enemies will actually DROP their radios are rigidly determined, and none of them let you take the 'crafted proximitiy mine' to the next enemy encounter. As for the 'dead body trap' thing, this has more to do with the enemy AI zoning - you would need to: A) Kill an enemy from stealth with more enemies remaining in the area. B) Have his body be in the open and 'visible' to other enemies (nearly impossible to do with 'stealth kills'). C) Not get 'spotted' at all, or they wouldn't 'check the body'.  6) I was kinda sad that rope arrows became 'contexztual only' - I had so many laughs in the first game using them to yank enemies off cliffs! XD  ----- So in summery, I really don't recommend this to anyone who wants to explore and play fun, thought provoking puzzles. I would highly recommend the first one over this one, but even so, I still think it's better than a lot of the garbage comming out of late from the AAA circle, so I will give the game a *tentative* 'yes' (if Steam offered a 'horizontal thumb' 'Meh' option, though, I'd be picking that one... &gt;_&lt;).",

If you liked TR 2013 as much as I did you'll love this game, it's essentially the same game only refined and made better with optional tombs actually affecting gameplay, so much so that you'll want to do them for more than just fun, more complex crafting and hunting becoming an actually necessary part of the game rather than the afterthought it was in the last game. Lastly, and thankfully, no tacked on and redundant multi-player.  From the following list it may seem like I'm dissing this game but it really is so good that those bad things just become more glaring.  That said, I do have some complaints: 1) wildlife, god damned wildlife, something is seriously wrong with a world where the wildlife is a bigger pain in the ♥♥♥ than waves upon waves of armed humans (it takes more shots to bring down a wolf or mountain lion than it does a person, and don't get me started about the bears, I emptied an entire stock of shotgun rounds and quite a few SMG rounds before one went down). 2) Camera angle, the camera, rather than being exactly behind, is slightly off center towards the right, you get used to it over time but it really is noticeable and irritating at first. 3) Suspension of belief, this is a game not real life so of course I'm more than willing to accept some of the more rediculous parts (the enemies at the end, swimming in and out of cold water lie it was nothing), but there are some pieces of equipment that are just plain silly, both are awarded later in the game. The first is broad-headed arrows, the idea itself that you can use them to help climb is one thing, but jumping from one to the next is just too much. The second is the rebreather, let's get this out of the way, this is not a rebreather, it is a water to air converter (you know, the ones that Obi-wan and Kwai-gon used in The Phanton Menace). 4) Lastly, and frankly the most irritating part, manuvering in the world. People will complain about Assassin's Creed free-running system but compared to this that is a Ferrari and this a Chevrolet Spark, the amount of times I've died simply because Lara did not move as I wanted her to is beyond count.",

There definitely wasn't enough exploration. And to make it worse, the maps are absolutely cluttered with collectibles, hundreds and hundreds of pointless collectibles. This took away a lot of the experience for me. I also did not enjoy the rpg-ish perk system. It's just not really usefull. I didn't like this system in the previous game, either. Also similar to the previous game, I didn't feel like I had to work to upgrade any of the guns. As long as you play the game, you'll unlock everything. I really don't like that, but others probably do. Now for my thoughts on the tombs, and newly added crypts. The tombs just aren't exciting. And they're usually too easy with only one single-tier puzzle to complete. If you skip the tombs, you won't be missing anything. The crypts aren't any better. They're like miniature tombs, but without the puzzle, and all you get are worthless coins. Adding on to the 2013 game, each area of the game has had the number of challenges increased from about 1-2 to about 4-5. Just like the collectibles, these really take away from the story, which is the main mechanic of this game.   Overall,  it's not bad, it's just not what it should have been. Even though the 2013 game took place on a single island, the environment constantly changed as you progressed. Rise of the Tomb Raider isn't like that. I'm going to do another playthrough, without collecting any crap this time, and see if my opinion on this game changes. If you don't have this game yet and want it, wait until it goes on sale. I don't think it's worth full price, considering they want you to buy the extra dlc.   Pros:",

It seems that there's poor memory management for textures in this game as at 720p I should be able to run this game at max textures like in every other game. And I have to say, at medium settings the textures look pretty bad for a game that's eating 2gbs of memory even at such a low resoltuion.  Overall, the game itself is pretty good.

            "review_text": "I enjoyed Tomb Raider's 2013 reboot more than I thought I would. I got it on sale, and was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the devs managed not to mangle one of the best-know game series out there. Given how good the reboot was and all that I'd heard about the next entry in the series, I was pretty excited for Rise.   The game mostly met my expectations, but didn't do much to blow my doors off. Once the (really bad) optimization issues were fixed, Rise looked beautiful and ran smoothly on high/very settings (970 FTW, i5 4690k, 8 GB RAM). The game's lighting is particularly noteworthy. It's amazing to look at a chem light's distorted reflection in a massive icicle.   On the gameplay side, things are decent. The platforming is fun (if a little spotty in places), the shooting feels much tighter than it did in the previous game, and the scripted moments are very intense. Yet a lot of the game feels a bit soulless to me. I found the skill trees shockingly mundane and often boring, to the point that I stopped spending skill points roughly halfway through the game. It just never felt worth it, and none of them seemed to alter gameplay enough to even justify the time it took to pick them. Similarly, the crafting system feels bolted on. Sure, you can add fancy barrels and extended magazines and the ability to quickly shoot three arrows, but you really don't need to. Combat encounters are infrequent, and they not particularly hard to survive even with iffy equipment.   Worse, much of the game feels restrictively scripted. Many combat encounters allow for stealth, but many others force you into guns-blazing battles for no apparent reason. The side missions feel bolted on as padding; I never felt interested or excited about 'clear out this cave' or 'kill four boars' quests for random faceless NPC #33,575. And because the skill points don't seem all that valuable, I was never given much of an incentive to do these missions other than to artificially extend my time with the game.   Even the open-world(ish) hub areas feel dull and lifeless. They're pretty, sure, but they just don't sing the way I'd hoped they would. They have no character, no life. Some of this problem may be due to the fact that there are patently obvious game signals everywhere--bare tree trunks you can climb, special walls to jump onto, rope pillars and pulleys to attach to stuff. I like the mechanics of the game, and I dug using most of Lara's moves and equipment. But the omnipresence of these signals never lets you forget you're playing a game, which seriously dings immersion. It's really hard to feel like you're in a real place when glowing objects, beams of light, and obvious interactive textures constantly remind you that you are playing a game.   Speaking of immersion, I was let down by the story. I appreciate the attempt to give the narrative some emotional weight, but I didn't connect with Lara in this iteration like I did in the last one. I didn't really care about Lara's daddy issues or self-righteous quest for vindication the same way I cared about her when she was hurt, scared, and vulnerable in the first game. Battle-hardened Lara Croft is a bad mama, but her badass-ery comes at the expense of the humanity that made the 2013 game so great.  Similarly, most of the supporting characters are so archetypical and two dimensional that I just couldn't bring myself to be interested in them. The villains, in particular, are flat, boring, and predictable. None of this is helped by the fact that that game's overarching narrative is the same as always in Tomb Raider: Lara must find ancient, powerful artifact before bad guys do. Oh, and she wants to redeem her dad's reputation. But mostly she just wants that shiny thing. The writers tried to spice things up with a couple of twists, but I saw the big one coming many hours before it happened. And when the big reveal finally occurred, it landed with pretty noticeable thud.   Where the game really shines is the optional tombs. These are genuinely interesting, and each one is unique. I very much enjoyed the ambience and story behind each tomb, and I found the puzzles--each of the tombs is based around a large environmental puzzle--to be challenging, interesting, and fun. Truth be told, I would happily pay $60 for a larger collection of these tombs, especially given the weakness of the game's overall story.   All told, I finished the game in about 16 hours. I didn't do all of the side content, but I did a fair amount of it, including the optional tombs I found. I don't have much interest in running around playing chase the icon to gather all the arbitrary stuff and complete all the arbitrary tasks needed to reach 100 percent. And because the story wasn't exactly the most compelling I've ever seen, I doubt I'll play this again any time in the near future. That's kind of a shame, really, because Rise has a lot of potential.  I hope the next iteration of Tomb Raider moves away fom the tightly scripted, gamey conventions of this entry and toward the much, much (MUCH) more enjoyable tombs, puzzles, and exploration that prop Rise up despite its faults. For now, I'd recommend that all outside of the most diehard completionists wait to pick this one up on sale.",

            "review_text": "Another AMAZING installment from Crystal Dynamics, this being the first direct sequel to the 'rebooted' Tomb Raider game from 2013. I'm loving this game so far.  Great overall story and setting so far. I'm only about 30% through the game at this point in time, so things are still unfolding for me. The general gameplay mechanics are pretty much 'more of the same' as TR 2013 - combat is pretty much the same as well, but they've introduced a number of enhancements and/or outright changes to character skill management and weapons upgrade management, as well as introducing a not-unnecessarily-complicated ammo/gear crafting system that allows you to craft your own ammo, as well as gear like quivers to increase arrow capacity, belt packs for increased pistol/rifle/shotgun ammo capacity, etc. These items can be crafted at base camps (campfires throughout the game) from various resources collected throughout the game world - we're collecting a bit more than just generic 'salvage' now...  As always with any Tomb Raider game, the graphics are pushed to a new level, this is easily one of the most gorgeous games I've ever seen. Make sure you've got the rig to handle this game if you prefer high detail levels. As a point of reference, I'm currently on a Core i7 3770K with 16 GB of RAM, and I was running two GTX 660s in SLI @ 1920 x 1080. I just upgraded to a single GTX 970 while continuing to use one of the GTX 660s as a dedicated PhysX card - everything else unchanged, and same resolution. I don't think this game supports PhysX, so the GTX 970 is doing pretty much everything. I've been using the 'Very High' graphics preset, but can't push things much beyond that and also can't seem to get past FXAA antialiasing, the other options on offer (MSAA and varying degrees of SSAA) just aren't running as smoothly as I prefer with a GTX 970, and even with FXAA, I'm still finding quite a few spots where FPS takes pretty rough nose dives.  Perhaps I'll just have to look into another GTX 970 for SLI and take care of that problem...",

I'd rather go for a shooter or an RPG first but Tomb Raider kind of does contain some of those elements so it kept me hugely satisfied throughout.  I feel that the game owes more to the Uncharted games than to the earlier Tomb Raiders and I don't have a problem with that. With some platform games I get frustrated if I miss a ledge, fall and have to repeat the process but this game gets it right. If I fell, I felt that it was usually my own fault. Same with the fighting and gun-play. You have to keep mobile but the mechanics are handled really well and loved using the bow - it felt really satisfying.  The graphics are amazing and are hugely detailed. There are many times where I stoped just to admire the view and this remains consistent throughout.  I like the way that you can build Lara's skills as you progress in the game so that killing faceless bad guys barely raises a sweat and we can relate to Lara with a fairly well written story,  I must admit that I enjoyed the first game more. I played that one on PS3 and collected everything but on this one I think that they lost focus in the final act, leaving the feeling that it was being dragged out. I wasn't disappointed that it was all over when I hit the final credits and that's a bit of a shame because they had excelled up until then.  So as a final thought, if you played the first one and liked it, there's no reason not to buy this. I did enjoy it but I felt that its predecessor was tighter.",

The gameplay is the same, but improved. There's a lot more to do, a lot more secondary tombs, lots of weapon upgrades and interesting Lara upgrades. And the Challenge mode only asks us to play some chapters again.",

        {
            "review_text": "Quite an enjoyable game, but the best part about it is actually the Endurance DLC. I recommend it for fans of TR 2013 and action movies. Do not recommend to people who expect a sophisticated story or are easily bothered by deus ex machina.  GRAPHICS: As with the previous title in the series, this game has absolutely stunning visuals. It does have issues with DX12 implementation however. It is a great game for resolutions above 1080p, as it has plenty of fine detail in grass, leaves etc that will show off the clarity of higher resolutions. Lara gets some sick hair physics, while other characters' hair gets some movement. There's some quality motion capture that really shines in close up cutscenes, and also it is nice to see a female protaganist with a range of outfits which for the most part are weather-appropriate.  STORY: Nothing particularly noteworthy here. Plenty of documents to give added insight around the main plot if you look hard enough, but the underlying story is kind of underwhelming. It is presented in a Hollywood-style fashion - not a lot of flesh, but a lot of production sparkle to distract from it. It is at least a human story with displays of emotion.  CORE GAMEPLAY: There is a mix of linear story sections and open areas to explore. Exploration has some rewarding moments here and there, and really shows off the visual quality of the game. Platforming is interesting but not particularly challenging - you can't accidentally walk off edges, camera usually points you in the direction you need to go, but there is enough variety in there to keep it from getting too repetitive. There are a lot of story sections in which you're escaping a structure that collapses around you or something of the sort - it is overused and melodramatic but you will die if you get sloppy, giving the scenes at least a sense of urgency. Puzzles are a good difficulty level - tricky enough to make you stop and think, but not enough to stall out the flow of the game. I would have preferred them a little longer however. Crafting and skills are more advanced than TR 2013, but still relatively simple.  COMBAT: Decent, but flawed. If you have decent aim I would not recomment playing on any less than Seasoned Raider. Some enemies will constantly throw explosives at you, forcing you to constantly dodge, while giving little real challenge. Headshots are overpowered as ♥♥♥♥. Melee feels a little awkward, especially on mouse + keyboard, but is useful and useable. Weapon variety has improved, with 3-4 different variations in each weapon category (bow, pistol, rifle, shotgun), 3 different types of special arrows, and craftable throwables such as molotovs and shrapnel grenades. It's a shame that most of the time this is reduced to your headshot scorer of choice. Stealth is a little disappointing; you have a variety of stealth tools at your disposal, however with no ability to move bodies, limited hiding abilities and many forced firefights through the story, it is difficult to maintain stealth long enough for it to be satisfying. The highlights would be the special arrows and the craftables; if you use these with body shots, combat is reasonably fun - until enemies spam explosives or you realise that headshots are just so much more effective.  ENDURANCE DLC: This is a good enough game mode to get it's own section. Seriously, I wish Crystal Dynamics made an entire game based on this. It's a lot more accessible than many of the online survival games out there where you can't reasonably survive as a solo player and/or will die a lot in the process of learning the game's mechanics. In Endurance Mode, Lara has to eat to offset starvation, and warm up by fireplaces to offset hypothermia, and if you neglect one of these you will die. You can select challenges to complete each run, as well as game-modifying cards, and then when you either escape or die you earn credits from these challenges and any artifacts you escape with, which can then be used to purchase randomised packs of cards. You have access to the full skill tree and upgrades menu for all weapons you pick up from fallen enemies, some of which are very useful, others less so. This mode actually offers better stealth action than the core game thanks to increased manouvering space and more serious consequences. Fights with bears, great cats and the harder versions of the human enemies are tenser than any fight in the core came too. The real letdown here is that there is only one map available currently, and two different layouts for crypts discovered. I also experienced game crashes at around the 5 day point, which I managed to solve by backdating to a previous version of the game.  SOUND: Stellar. The soundtrack is very well crafted builds great tension, and responds dynamically to the level of danger ingame with multiple levels of intensity. Voice acting is generally quite good, in spite of the mediocre story. Sound effects have quality to match. I will also add here that listening for animal sounds is quite important in Endurance mode; it's nice to know if you're walking approximately towards a bear, especially if you're out of poison arrows.  OVERALL: This review probably sounds like a mixed review - but I definitely feel positive about the game. It does have its flaws, but the overall experience is great for the most part. If you allow yourself to be wowed by it's good qualities, you might just find yourself forgiving it for its shortcomings as I did.",

I ran the game on very high for the most part at 60 fps 1080 with very few frame drops. If you played the last one, you’ll be very familiar with the mechanics, they do add a couple of new ones but they are very straightforward. Story wise, it’s very similar to the last game, but still very enjoyable.Combat and stealth are very satisfying but the stealth part isn’t emphasized too much so if you're not that type of player, you can still kill everything if you want to. The optional tombs are still short which is kinda a drag but are a bit more challenging I found, that or I’m just dumb. Overall this is a great game if you’re looking for something that’s visually stunning, puzzling and a lot of action, I would recommend this strongly.",

            "review_text": "Rise of the Tomb Raider is an amazing game I cannot recommend this game enough. In this review I will explain why  Story  This game takes place two years after the original tomb raider. Laura is trying to repair her fathers legacy by finishing his research. That is the gist of what happens. You go to two main places. Siberia and Syria. The Story is Quite amazing which went along with the previous game. Just a heads up if you thought the first games ending is epic. It is childs play to this one as it sets the series up for games to come. I felt adreniline while playing this game and you really feel for Lauras adventures. As with the theme of the previous game Survival is the theme. Which Tomb Raider does really well with. FYI guys the cliff hanger is rediculous it is eating me away as I write this review. Charachter development is phenomenol you really see how Laura has changed over the two years and how experienced she has become. (I really like the part in the begining of the game when she is in a tomb that the bad guys blast their way in and the part when she smiles when she takes it from Konstantine. The look she gives him is priceless it is the I survived worse, lets see how you do look.) I really like the coolness in situation and the confidence that she can survive any situation. She has this cool franticness to her.   Gameplay  The previous Tomb Raider kind of struggled with its theme of survival. I mean yes you hunted for dear, collected fruit, and fought for your life but when I was going through the motions of these the only thing I cared about was collecting salvage. This game however everything matters. It is really good at making the efforts of hunting hard animals and other things worth your arrows and other amunition. In this game you can make your own ammo (in some cases it is a real life saver). You also have an option that the game presses you to do quite often to heal yourself. Which makes the foraging you are doing actually mean something even life saving. This game builds on the previous game really well it really goes with the idea that she is more experienced. You see that in the skill tree, the weapons and items that she uses. Stealth has been improved allot which was kind of need in the first game. This game is very refined and the cinimatics are very enjoyable. The attention to detail in this game is outstanding and for those 100% this game will take a long time because there are so many challenges so many things that one can do in this game. This game is also really good at getting you to explore. The perks in the challenge tombs are awesome. The challenge tombs are awesome they don't take allot of time to do but they will make you really think things out.   This game is amazing I loved evry bit of it. I want more of this game this is what I look for in a game.   ",

Expect explosions. Lots of explosions. The plot is simple, yet the chracters and their noticable developments keep it interesting. The game is pretty repatative however in terms of platforming, but the backdrops and sheer scale (as well as the ridiculous ♥♥♥♥ Lara is doing) make up for that flaw.  The game, even on higher dificulties, is still pretty easy. -I use a controller to make things a bit harder.  Now on to the graphics - oh yes those delicious, eye watering visuals. Be cautious as this game will ♥♥♥♥ most cards on higher settings, even my gtx 970 has difficulty hitting 60 fps with very high textures (thanks, vram).  The lighting, the ambient occlusion, the extrememly detailed textures, THE HAIR PHYSICS, all come together to create an absolutely visualy stunning expirience.  Overall I would recommend this game, nice gameplay, great visuals, quality voice acting - though a bit repetative most people wouldn't mind. - keep in mind the game can be as long as you want it to be.

MECHANICS The mechanics of the game laregely remain the same from the last game, WHICH IS OK. It feels like a continuation of Tomb Raider, and RotTR feels like another adventure within the same world. There's a new crafting system so you're not constantly scrounging for arrows, and there are a few new types of ammunition and such, but for the most part, it feels familiar with some improvements added on. The developers actually listened to the advice of 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'  STORY Not done yet, but from what I've gone through so far, it's very engrossing, gripping, and gets very personal for Lara.  VISUALS This game wins the contest. Period. Absolutely gorgeous; the snow effects are incredible, the new hair software is incredible and actually looks real, rather than the solid, unmoving blocks you see in other games, and the level of detail in Lara's character and the rest of the game is unparalleled.

There are modes for hardcore survival, basic mode, and the cinematic mode I do believe.  HOWEVER, this game had some levels or sections that really made me mad. Occasionally the camera would shift angles and make it impossible to judge a jump or figure out where to go. If the camera just stayed in place over Lara that would be nice, but no. It may because of the game mode I was playing, I can't really test it out since most of those levels were at the end of the game. This game also has some levels that feel copied and pasted from the Tomb Raider 2013 game. A little bit of a nit pick however.

Whole levels look and play the same. Again Miss Croft left to fight for survival. Yes part of the fun but could you not find a different setting (e.g. urban).  As for outfits, they show little variation. Personally like business suit from Tomb Raider Legends or classic diver outfit in many early games.  Sadly as for plot, story, level design and outfits go Tomb Raider Legends still wins.  You would think that designers had not seen Indiana Jones. Here’s a quote to take in to account when designing future adventures:  “90% of an archaeologist's time is spent in the library. Myths can only be taken at face value.

This game was a lot of fun to play and the combat (for me anyway) was engaging and fun. Controls were great as well and the graphics were top notch! There were enough side items to do to mix things up and extend the gameplay, but not so many that it felt like a chore.  If you have a powerful system, this game at 2K (or higher) at fully maxed settings looks amazing! Once again, like Tomb Raider 2013, this game is what caused me to upgrade and buy a GTX1080 and replace my old 2 GTX 770’s 4GB in SLI. Once I did that, I could fully max out this game at 2K and get very smooth gameplay. That alone was worth the experience.  Overall, I do not have much more to say than the game was definitely worth playing and I may consider another play through using the endurance mode DLC add-on to add another layer of difficulty. I believe I bought this game when it first came out (and was on sale) but did not get to it until recently.

There is also a lot more to craft and I like the skills you can purchase in this game as well over the previous one. I don't really get why you can unlock all skills. Maybe this is just me, but I think it would be more fun to limit the skills you can buy so you can try out different playstyles and have to think about the skills you buy rather than 'catching them all'.   They added a lot more lore and treasures into the game, which is great! However... There is so much to find, that scouting around the area, trying to get to each one of these items gets a bit repetitive after a while. That and maybe still not enough challenging tombs to work your way through (Is there such a thing of too many tombs in Tomb Raider games??? I think not..)

But overall the game is realy solid, looks gorgeous, the story gets a little out of hand towards the end and some minor things like misgrabbing a ledge.

Ok so performance wise you need a gtx 980 ti/1070 to run this game on 60 fps consistently, because as i said with 970 on very high(there is no ultra )-high setting the game dips below 60 sometimes with no apparent reason especially in cutsenses !   Graphics are breathtaking if you have mid range GPU i would recommend you wait till you can affored a gtx 1070 or the new 200$ AMD card before playing this game.  GamePlay AWESOME action adventure with some rpg flavor with your good old skill tree, its not an open world game like the witcher 3 but there are some hub areas where you can explore and collect stuff and do some side quests+ optional tombs which are realy realllly fun, shooting is like the last game you have bow and arrows and couple of guns.

I found it to be a bit cliche but still entertaining (was just waiting for the Last Crusade comparisions to come in). The voice acting was superb and the direction of some scenes were impressive (obviously took a few pages from Naughty Dog's book). It did not have as many 'cinematic'-holy sh*t moments but the over all atmosphere and movement throughout the environment felt so much more alive and dangerous. The leveling system is simplistic enough and there's a lot of random stuff to find to help 'level up' quicker. I found that the additional 'shop' with its own currency was a bit annoying (there is only one that you had to quick travel to every so often to get a random tool/weapon/upgrade) but the stuff provided wasn't absolutely necessary, just nice to have (it did have the best assault rifle though). The puzzles in the game are fairly simple and the only aggravating part were the times I couldn't find where to jump or go- usually missing a small crack in the wall to squeeze through or was just stupidly blinded by the detailed environment (easily ignored if you have the perk to help in tombs/puzzles). Combat was iffy but if you are like me and like to snipe people with the bow, it really wasn't an issue. Hand-to-hand was clumsy but of course it's never really recommended even though you can learn counters . The silenced killing opportunities were always a plus- especially one place where I took out a whole room of baddies while under the ice.... just awesome. Completed the game at an 85% completion with 20 hrs at the time of this review. I'm still going back to find all the unlocks and items. I have not played the other mode where you can unlock perk cards to challenge others in different scenarios from the game's mission list or arena zones although I will soon just so that I can try and perfect Lara's silent killings. Can't wait for more DLC to come out- definitely a great game especially if you're itching to play Uncharted on the PC.",

The game looks pretty good, I was getting 60 most of the time on high-very high on a 970 -HOWEVER- during the firist few hours of gameplay when cutscenes would both initiate and return to gameplay there were HUGE hitches. It eventually stopped and I wasn't getting any frame dips other than areas that were just more taxing. Lowest sustained framerate I had for an extended period of time was probably around 48 for a minute or so during intense effects. Optimization isn't perfect but it's 90%, and the hair technology isn't nearly as hard to run as it was in the previous title.  As for plot, it's nothing extaordinary, it's what you would expect from an adventure game, and is very similar to the 2013 game.  The platforming as almost identical to the previous game, there's some more interesting action scenes this time around but to be honest nothing that really held a candle to some of the Uncharted scenes.

I was never a huge fan of Tomb Raider series before but now with the newest reboot I am fully on board this train. The gameplay is as fluid as the previous one with some new gadgets and ways to use your new skills. Also a basic crafting system is there that is both fast and very easy to use in and out of combat. The story is what you would expect if you played the last one with some characters stand outs. There are plenty of optional tombs and crypts to be discovered. I have gotten pretty far in the game and aside of couple of crashes the game ran smoothly for me and if you want to play it maxed out you will need a more capable machine to pull it out. I had big expectations for this title when it was announced and to my amazement it did not disappoint. Truly hope that this franchise will stay with us and next time without the exclusivity shambles the puled this time around. I want absolutely everyone to enjoy this title, because even though this game was technically released last year for me represents an awesome start of 2016.

In fact the platforming is at the forefront here, kind of reminds me of the old crash bandicoot days, thats always a good sign.

If you liked TR 2013 as much as I did you'll love this game, it's essentially the same game only refined and made better with optional tombs actually affecting gameplay, so much so that you'll want to do them for more than just fun, more complex crafting and hunting becoming an actually necessary part of the game rather than the afterthought it was in the last game. Lastly, and thankfully, no tacked on and redundant multi-player.  From the following list it may seem like I'm dissing this game but it really is so good that those bad things just become more glaring.  That said, I do have some complaints: 1) wildlife, god damned wildlife, something is seriously wrong with a world where the wildlife is a bigger pain in the ♥♥♥ than waves upon waves of armed humans (it takes more shots to bring down a wolf or mountain lion than it does a person, and don't get me started about the bears, I emptied an entire stock of shotgun rounds and quite a few SMG rounds before one went down). 2) Camera angle, the camera, rather than being exactly behind, is slightly off center towards the right, you get used to it over time but it really is noticeable and irritating at first. 3) Suspension of belief, this is a game not real life so of course I'm more than willing to accept some of the more rediculous parts (the enemies at the end, swimming in and out of cold water lie it was nothing), but there are some pieces of equipment that are just plain silly, both are awarded later in the game. The first is broad-headed arrows, the idea itself that you can use them to help climb is one thing, but jumping from one to the next is just too much. The second is the rebreather, let's get this out of the way, this is not a rebreather, it is a water to air converter (you know, the ones that Obi-wan and Kwai-gon used in The Phanton Menace). 4) Lastly, and frankly the most irritating part, manuvering in the world. People will complain about Assassin's Creed free-running system but compared to this that is a Ferrari and this a Chevrolet Spark, the amount of times I've died simply because Lara did not move as I wanted her to is beyond count.",

Gotta love bruised and dust-covered Lara stealthily snuffing evil foes and surviving the hell out of the extreme terrain, shivering from the cold at times. Satisfying puzzle/fighting/scavenging balance. Loved the more intense take-downs, the series could still use more realism in fighting and the ways Lara can die in, very graphicly, by the hands of her foes or traps, would make it even more intense and terrifying.

Somehow the storyline felt more boring and I was a lot less engaged than in the 2013 game. But still a better love story than twilight. This is what let me down the most. For the first 8hours or so I honestly didnt care if anyone in the story died, it just didnt get me engaged in the storyline. Then the last 4 hours just ramped it up and threw in every plot twist and developed everyones character. But because 2/3 of the game was just boring story, it really lets the game down.   The platforming/graphic/gunplay/everything is the exact same as 2013. Good graphics and gunplay/fighting and playforming is complete cancer. Whenever there is a playforming section it just feels like a massive cutscene. Theres no risk or reward; you die and respawn back to where you were 4 seconds ago.   Game is too easy. Played on hardest difficulty and died max twice per gunfight. Maybe thats just me idk, the handheld explosives and barrels 1 shot everything so you dont even need to bother aiming for headshots.   Animations in this game is the best I have ever seen, pretty much perfection.  Game is perfectly optimised. No CTD, framerate issues etc. Runs smoothly with maxed graphic settings.   tl;dr too easy, boring story untill the end, good graphics, good combat, perfect optimisation, perfect animations 8/10",

Also !! this one has a gigantic atrocity to a game with the Tomb Raider name on it, as it has a button ... that if pressed ... it show you where you need to go.... no really, i'm not joking, you hold a button and it straight out magicaly show you where you have to go, so you just follow it like a zombie, jumping around with the magical movement mechanics of Lara ( poor Lara, has fallen from grace i guess ). Plays best with a controller i guess. The game runs ok on my machine, with some settings dialed back a notch, in 1920x1080, the frame rate dips a bit from 60 to 40ish a lot of times ( as show by the Nvidia thingy with a green number on the top left ). I'm personaly ok with it, but i know many people are not, so...  For technical safety, my PC is pretty old &gt;&gt;  Core i5 something something 2 gtx 660 ti twin frozr something  ( no idea how to make the 2 work together, but they do sometimes i guess, on their onw o.O, i don't mind much ) 8gb ram memory 2 tb hard drive  ( I myself don't know a lot about PCs and dont mind much, my brohter built this one for me about 2 to 3 years ago )  Have fun, i understand the appeal of the game, and how much care went into it, as the things that make me hate it are by no means bad things on their own or bugs and such, but are due to my personal taste not matching the creators design decisions, so i'll recomend it anyways, it's a well made game, that's for sure.",

I'm very used to the previous Tomb Raider games, like Legend, where instead of being restriced to one big area, she visits different countries. I did feel very limited in that way, but the story kept me going.  I've completed the game, and have just a couple of collectibles left.

And the story itself isn't any good either, full of tropes and clichés.  Despite all this I like this one like TR 2013, but certainly not at full price. Paid 25 euros, played 25 hours, seems like a good balance. Animations, especially for the faces, are awesome, voice acting is good, graphics are OK but demanding ( couldn't get 60fps all the way through with a GTX970, it dropped to 50 no matter the settings ), combat is nice with plenty of options ( I used the bow and handgun most of the time ), and Lara being kinda 'weak' ( she dies in a few hits ) makes it almost challenging at time. Almost.  The stupid 'explorer's senses' highlighting everything for you on the other hand is useless and makes an easy game even easier, pretty much like the skills system. They are trying so hard to catter to casuals it's painful.  Also Lara's ♥♥♥♥ are smaller than ever. At this rate she'll be a dude in the next game. Wait, I can't write ♥♥♥♥ ? T I T S !

Rise of the Tomb Raider feels as if a PC version was being developed from the ground up because of the sheer amount of graphics customizations available from the get go. This game was made by a development team who cared.   I have a mid-low end pc by everyone's million dollar standards:  Processor: Intel Core i5-4460 3.20 Ghz Ram: 8 GB Graphics: Nvidia GTX 750 Ti 2GB  This game will run on medium settings at 40-50 fps no problem for me, which I'm still shocked by considering the attention to detail. I play with true hair on (not at very high) and I'm aware that turning it off would give me a LOT of frames back but honestly the True Hair is so hypnotizingly realistic I don't want to turn it off.  EDITED SECTION: The gameplay is also great. It's a lot more sandboxy than I thought it would be, with the ability to fast travel between campfires returning, but elements in the environment, such as ancient scriptures, inspire you to actually use this feature. You might not be able to translate something, play the game more, learn the language you needed, and return to read what you previously couldn't. Additionally, The tombs and crypts add the deep exploration aspect to the game, something that Tomb Raider 2013 lacked greatly. Exploring tombs and crypts give you tangible rewards such as new skills only acquired through completing these tombs. Now there's an actual giddiness I get when I see these gargantuan ruins because I know that there's always a seriously sweet reward waiting for me at the end. The addition of a trader is also interesting, whereas you can buy weapon attachments, standalone weapons, and resources in exchange for byzantine gold coins which, you guessed it, are found by exploring the environment thoroughly. This by far is the best game I've played in 2016.  I wish people would stop emphasizing Lara's breasts or butt in the half-♥♥♥♥♥ reviews that are topping the section so more people can actually talk about the amazing visual fidelity, great optimization, and great gameplay improvements that this game has given us.",

It felt like a less stellar version of Uncharted and had a very inconsistent production value. But I still played it a lot, for some reason. The gameplay was fun and something about it always got me coming back despite the cheap aftertaste.  Rise fixes everything; it has the level of detail, animations, setpieces, graphics (oh god! dem grepheecs!!!), beautiful (real-time!) cutscenes, gameplay, story and 'everything' to make Uncharted (which I love) look downright amateurish in comparison (Oh, how the turntables...).  And what TR2013 did great/better, Rise does even more betterer. The combat and platforming are even more fun and there's so much... stuff. It's really open to experimentation, even with things as linear as the climbing and platforming, there's so many strategies and way to approach each situation. Even when it's going full Uncharted in therms of setpieces, it still manages to match and downright surpass the level of quality Uncharted set as the standard.  In short, it's incredible! Not quite an RE4 or HL2 level masterpiece, but a very strong 9/10.  And, for those having a hard time playing it: Put the textures to high. If that doesn't work, wait for a patch. And if the patch doesn't work, start realizing that the next gen is here, this port is actually really good and newer games having a hard time running on somewhat older hardware is not a crime, it's the norm.  Just because the climb this generation isn't as steep as it was when Crysis came out, doesn't meant it doesn't exist anymore. PC games become more demanding as time passes.

            "review_text": "An amazing return to the adventures of Lara Croft. Even better than the original reboot released a couple years ago. First, I'm running on dual Sapphire Tri-X R290s in Xfire with everything cranked up to High or Ultra (if allowable) and the game ran fantastic. Also running an AMD FX 8350 on an Asus Sabertooth 990FX gen 3 with 16GB of Ripjaw on a 1TB WD Velociraptor. Now, with that out of the way, moving on.   As you may be able to tell from the stills on the Store Page, the game looks absolutely fantastic with everything up High. Environments are crisp and detailed. Small things like foot marks left from trudging through the snow, crisp winter air being exhaled and the hair all look phenomenal. Character design is top notch and character movement is swift and on point. Everything from the ground textures to the trees to the tomb designs are all very detailed and very well done.    Sound design is what you'd expect from CD. Full 5.1 surround implemented with ambient localization to character placement. Very nicely done. Guns have a nice pop, the twang of the bow being pulled and released is deadly accurate and the voice acting is top notch. Music takes the normal approach of being soft and subtle until you get into a fight or battle then expect to hear the pounding drums and native flutes bouying over the air to your attempts at staying alive.    The level design is a lot more open this time around. There are larger areas that have multiple avenues of exploration and camping allowed as well as many secrets that won't be found until a later return afer some upgrades have happened. There are different levels of exploration in this Tomb Raider. Beginning with the game's exploration of open areas, the tombs that have been amped up and many different iterations and lastly with the secret hunt quests that begin when you do certain actions. All well done and nicely implemented into the whole of its parts.    There's a really nice upgrade path this time around, similar to the reboot, and while allowing the basic avenues of upgrading Lara's abilities, I would have liked to see it have maybe a few more options when going down either of the 3 paths in the game. While some are interesting, some are your 'average' upgrades. Things like more health, or able to take more punishment would have been nicely tied into upgrading your equipment and clothing to include maybe some ballistic panels or whatnot. Still, it's nicely done and will have you thinking for a few minutes while you choose your path in this game.    The story arc is well written and extemely well voice acted. While the story does take some dips here and there, the story makes a case of being well prepared and ready for anything while adventuring. Lara is again the highlight of the game and is so fluid in her character design decisions and acting that it's completely believable in the end. Villain arcs are ripped right of the 'bad guy handbook' and, while done well, could have been a bit more interesting in the long run. The game took me about 30 hours and that was with heavy exploring and hunting, going for certain upgrades, etc. I never once thought the game's pacing was taking too long and was thoroughly enjoyed with my entire romp in the completely believable world that has been created for us.    While I won't give away and spoilers I will say this. The game ends with a little something that lets us know there will be another Tomb Raider at some point, and personally, I can't wait to get my hands on it if it's anywhere near as fantastic as the past two games have been.",

It's this one factor alone that just keeps me coming back for more and I thoroughly enjoy it. In my eyes, it's almost like a third-person version of Far Cry 4 and I played that game for hours upon hours simply to max out my character's stats.

It took the game industry by storm with its cinematic gameplay, fantastic visuals, huge open world, and realism. What could Crystal Dynamics do to top this you ask? It's pretty hard to top that and they didn't quite top it this time around. Rise of the Tomb Raider is more of what we got before and not much else but that's not a bad thing.  The game doesn't focus so much on Lara's survival to get back home but more on her treasure hunting. There's an item called the Divine Source that grants people immortality. It's something that her father obsessed on and ultimately got him killed. A mercenary group called Trinity wants this source so it's Lara's job to go and retrieve it before anyone gets their hands on it. The story is a little predictable and cheesy. It's the typical generic mercenary bad guy plot which I found uninteresting as Lara's character development was the center of the story in the last game. It's disappointing, but entertaining nonetheless.  The opening scene in RotTR is fantastic set in Tibet where you get to feel just how dangerous Lara's treks are and the environment around you. It's probably the best scene in the whole game as the developers slowly forgot what made Tomb Raider...Tomb Raider towards the end of the game like they were running out of ideas. You will notice right away the huge visual upgrade over the last game. Fantastic lighting effects, tessellation, gorgeous textures, and the character modeling is some of the best I have ever seen. The individual pores can be seen on Lara's face which is 10x more detail than the last game.  After the opening scene I realize not too much has changed from the last game control wise and the gameplay elements are nearly untouched just fine tuned. After I start trekking along in the first area I divert by exploring and finding all the hidden stuff. TR has a lot of hidden secrets to find and it's all about using your Instincts around you to find all the secrets that glow gold and finding the maps to reveal them on your map. I spent a majority of the game finding these secrets which are a blast to find however there's a Metroidvania feeling to this game. I had to acquire new equipment before I could enter certain areas especially the tombs.  While just playing the game in general I realized a few disappointing things about this game. Leveling up completely, upgrading all your guns, just like in the last game, means less this time around. The game is fairly easy, the mix between exploration, combat, and stealth are very random and spread out. I could honestly play the entire game with the pistol and I would be fine. The last game had enemies that required different weapons, but this time around Crystal didn't think about that. All the enemies are generic and there's no need to switch weapons. This is a huge blow to the games strategy that was so great in the last game. Ultimately this meant that all the side quests, gathering, and exploring could ultimately be skipped and it wouldn't make a difference. That's a really bad thing here.  Thankfully all the gameplay holds up to redeem this issue. Mainly this is here for completionists or anyone who wants to explore this gorgeous world. I think the developers forgot what was so great about TR between development cycles and it really shows here. The world was focused on so much that the stuff to fill it was pretty much forgotten. I have all these awesome weapons and upgrades, but...what do I do with them? I can craft special ammo for each weapon, but it didn't make a lick of a difference in combat. The only ammo that did was the new arrow types such as poison, explosive, and flame. Using them to take out a large group of enemies helped but that was it.  Lara also doesn't really develop more in this game. I thought the psychological stress on her from the last game would affect her here, but it's like it never happened at all. Her character is awesome as usual, but there's no more development and I feel the next game really needs to pick up on what made the first one so great. Franchise fatigue is going to set in quick here and many players may not be so excited for the next game if this keeps up.  In the end, RotTR is a fantastic game with a huge world to explore, a generic yet entertaining story, and more Lara Croft which is what we want. The biggest disappointment is there's no more character development for Lara and all these great upgrades and weapons feel useless due to the combat and enemies that didn't get any attention. The game is really easy and lacks a good challenge. The game is gorgeous, one of the best looking games ever made and continues to push PCs to their limits just like back in 2012.  ~Score: 9/10",

The story was intresting, i got the first tomb raider and was blown away by the story, this game doesn't dissapoint.  There were some game breaking instances where ceartin abilities would make you too op, like the true shot ability, instant headshots with very little effort, or in other cases where the game would stutter like crazy but thats more due to my medium grade graphics card, and after a little episode in the very beginning where it was stuttering like crazy, it did not stutter at all for the rest of the game. I think the most laughable aspect of the game is Lara's insane physics breaking jump, it was a little crazy the first game but it was just hilarious in this one.  Boss fights however were a joke, on normal at least, most of the time you're just dodging bullets, then its a one hit K.O, enemies in the begginning were not utilized properly in my opinion, and wildlife is pretty scarce in the game too aside from birds and rabbits.   I thought it was a pretty good game, although once you've beat the game, theres little to come back for. The plot twist towards the end opens the door to a new tomb raider in the next 2 years, im glad but hope they can fix the mistakes in the game.",

            "review_text": "I will keep this review as spoiler-free as I possibly can, so... here goes:  OVERALL RATING: ★★★★☆ (4/5)  Before I start this review, please note that I firmly believe that the Tomb Raider graphic novels are important if you want to know the FULL story here. They're not NECESSARY, but RECOMMENDED, should you want to understand everything that happened between Yamatai and the start of ROTTR (they do refer to things that happen in the graphic novels), so should you want a more whole story, I'd advise reading these prior to playing. They bridge the gap perfectly between the 2013 game and that which we see in ROTTR. I think they're well-worth the read, and the artwork is wonderful.  Traverse the snowy mountains and geothermal valleys as Lara does what she does best (even though what she does best seems to be butchering hundreds of people to find rusty old coins). You can see Lara wring out her hair after jumping in water, wrinkle her nose as she aims, and advance through truly breathtaking areas. I'm... I think I'm in love!  It's a fantastic game. I mean, it's amazing: it's got some interesting characters and some wonderful voice-acting, not to mention the beautiful graphics. I love the relationship between Jonah and his Little Bird (Lara). We meet some fantastic characters throughout the story. The story-arc was fantastic, with some wonderful details into both Lara's childhood and the life of Lord Croft himself...  However... that isn't to say that the story isn't without flaws. It's not a bad plot (in fact, it's wonderful), but it is quite predictable in places, and the formula is very, very, very similar to the 2013 game. Not only that, but the latter half of the story seems VERY rushed; I was under the belief that I was around half-way through the plot when BAM, I hit the point of no return. I think it could have been stretched a lot further with what they had: there were gaps in the cut-scenes I thought could have provided an interesting bit of gameplay, but alas, no such luck! It isn't a bad story by any means, but it was VERY SHORT.  The documents and relics are wonderfully detailed, and I loved listening to and reading the recordings found throughout the game. Some of the ancient text doesn't quite add-up with what Lara claims it to say, but I expected as much and so wasn't greatly disappointed. My only issue is that there are one or two grammatical errors in the writing where there shouldn't be, and it just seemed a little like nobody had bothered to proof-read some of them.   The hunting is just as good, and the crafting is a FANTASTIC improvement. I think I might be in love with the designs of the bows in particular. I really enjoyed the tracking element they added, and the outfits actually HAVE USES now (for example; stronger effects to certain things, higher carrying capacity), which is WONDERFUL.   I really enjoyed the challenge tombs in this game - I think they're a great improvement on its predecessor - and I'm pleased they game them some sort of purpose. It gave me a reason to complete them aside from wanting to see that little '100% complete' in my menu. They're also more interesting than they were in the last game, and a LOT less irritating, I found.   Graphically speaking, it's beautiful. I'm not massively bothered by graphics in games, but there were moments in the game I was utterly lost for words. The landscaping is beautiful. That's... all I really have to say about this topic.  The Baba Yaga DLC is short. Thankfully, it's not extremely expensive, but I feel that it simply fit in as a side mission with the main game. I think it made the game, overall, feel more worthwhile (I purchased the season pass with the game). I enjoyed the plot, but again, it was predictable and seemed to be cut-short.  [Expeditions will be reviewed after being played thoroughly]  I didn't encounter too many bugs in the game (impressive, considering it was only released a few days ago), though I did have to restart one or two checkpoints to trigger the next cutscenes, as they simply didn't load when they should have.  The game is, overall, brilliant (though it has its flaws). If you enjoyed the first of this reboot series, I strongly recommend this one. I really enjoyed the time I spent on it... If, however, you look for replayability, I don't think you'll enjoy this game as much as you should. I'd still recommend buying it, but if you want a lot of gameplay for your purchase, wait for it to go on sale.",

Pros:   Awesome graphics, especially on dx12  Cons:  The keyboard and mouse controls, along with clumsy gameplay in some aspects make for annoying breaks in the immersion  In the early part of the game there are many cutscenes, for lack of a better word. I'm referring to the long and short periods where you lose control of Lara and are forced to watch her do something. I'm not referring to the short pre-scripted actions like Lara squeezing through a gap.    Longer set of comments: 47 Minutes in and I'm not impressed. Clumsy keyboard and mouse controls, constant annoying cutscenes, cliche storyline.  Also not the open-world feeling I was hoping for.  On the plus side, the graphics are good  I'll try it with a controller to see if that improves the experience, but I doubt it. This feels like a game from 2000 with forced or limited perspectives  [Edit] 21 Hours into the game and I've changed my recommendation to positive. The number of custscenes or periods where you lose control of your character have reduced significantly and you become accustomed to the mouse/keyboard controls. There are still gameplay annoyances, but the game as a whole is enjoyable.  One additional thing that I find annoying is the constant back and forth to complete missions in different areas. For example you need a rebreather to go into 2 caves in one area, but you only obtain that later in the next area. Maybe this is an attempt to try and avoid a linear storyline.",

            "review_text": "If you want this game, wait and pick it up on sale. Rise of the Tomb Raider is beautiful and the opening showed promise, but the game fell off about 15% in. Much of the trouble comes from infectious game mechanics which have permeated the modern industry, but the plot was also weak and predictable (I sussed out the big twist at the 15% point.). For your convenience as a prospective buyer, I’ve divided my impressions of the game into the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.   The Good: Rise of the Tomb Raider is visually stunning. Playing it is much like watching a movie and the ‘cutscenes’ stitch seamlessly into the gameplay.  The platforming is enrapturing; the free-world setup of climbing and exploration makes each area a parkour playground. It was fun just running around in the wilds of the mountains. The ambiance of the world was well established and having rabbits run from your feet before a giant cat pounces you from the brush was one of the better aspects of the game.  The mini-tombs were definitively the best part of the game: encapsulated platformer puzzles hidden throughout the game gave a good breather from the (ugh) plot and made RotTR feel like a Metroidvania.   The Bad: The game implied danger; in the tutorial it explained that progress would be lost between campfires. Early in the game I believed this warning and frequently returned to campfires to save my progress. However, when I finally did die I found the game reloaded not at the last campfire but mere steps from where I had failed. The game has no risk. You don’t even lose resources (ugh) when you die, because the game autosaves after each rustled bush or kicked basket. I get that players don’t like to be frustrated, but the hand-holding in this game was excessive, particularly considering the warning.  The swarms of faceless “mooks” that you have to kill. The original Tomb Raider (for Playstation 1) stumbled onto a concept that was delightful… something the developers have failed to replicate even after two sets of reboots. In Tomb Raider, when you ran into another human being you knew that things were getting serious. They were few and far between, each was a significant threat (because their guns were actually lethal) and you had to strategize to defeat them. Doing so would give you a significant upgrade to your gear, facilitating the next branch of exploration. I felt no threat from encounters with the faceless “Trinity” forces and their endless numbers gave their deaths no meaning. I blame Uncharted and Grand Theft Auto for infecting modern gaming with this shoot-em-up mentality.  The Leveling. Any kind of immersion created by the graphics was immediately broken by the constant stream of Experience popping up after every successful action. I have no idea why modern games feel the need to have experience points; most of the upgrades could have been distributed among plot points instead. While the leveling process could be considered an acclimation to the hostile environment, it didn’t need to be so intrusive.   The Ugly:  “Crafting”. For some reason all modern games feel the need to include recipe books where you assemble junk you’ve collected from “The Wilds” (trademark) into something useful. This is the noxious contagion of that Minecraft game and its ilk and it has permeated every genre now. The crafting in this game was disgusting--you have to hunt dozens of animals to get enough scraps of hide to make a quiver for more arrows which--by the way--you don’t need anyway because you can make arrows on the fly with wood and feathers (which you find EVERYWHERE). The “resources” the game employs become layers of ammunition obfuscating your actual ammunition to the point where you just stop caring about how much stuff you have. The sad thing is this mechanic could have been turned around by circumventing the crafting lists for something cinematic. Make us hunt ONE deer to make our first quiver and then shelve that mechanic!  Lazy Lore. Superfluous content added to give the game more meat for 100%. Some of the early murals actually depicted the Prophet performing great deeds in historic venues. But… after about 15% progress the “murals” became nothing more than wall diamonds with generic text which Lara would read to fill a Language meter. That’s not a mural, it’s a plaque. If all of those little hidden “murals” had been combined into a single one with an actual image relevant to the dialogue it would have been much more satisfying.  The plot. Ugh. The plot was boring, predictable, lacked character development or motivating factors, frequently forgot important details (Oh hey, where’s Jonah? Oh, the game’s almost over, I guess I should remember I left him on the mountain now!), leaned too heavily on an infinitely powerful “secret” organization, and also depended too heavily on “That was you!?” shock drama. The sad thing is that the plot could have been salvaged with a second pass; characters had established details which were not explored and another draft before production could have improved it. By the last stretch I was so fatigued by the tired conflict I just wanted to roll credits.   What I would've done (WIWD): One: Cut the crafting. If the player goes up to a sapling and breaks off branches, just put regular arrows into their inventory. Special ammo? Using a resource node adds it to the pouch. Make ammo upgrades single-hunt side quests. Resource crafting tables are dull and need to go away.  Two: The plot. Ana’s illness should have been the driving force for Lara to seek the Source; attempting to save her step-mother’s life instead of trying to redeem her dead father’s name would have helped to make Lara more admirable and would have added some literary barbs to later events. Lara also needed to put more focus on reuniting with her friend Jonah; once she fell from the mountain she completely shrugged off her concerns for his safety… this made her unlikeable and was sloppy considering the relationship established between them before that event. “Trinity” was entirely unnecessary; Konstantin could easily have misappropriated a government force or even a private organization to suit his ends instead of being part of a faceless illuminati organization which was frankly unbelievable (any group with as many resources as were mustered in this game could not remain invisible to world governments).  Three: The mooks. Konstantin should have brought an elite force of mercenaries (like… a dozen) to the mountains to seek the Source. He didn’t need hundreds of expendable minions who were all apparently willing to fight to the death. He also didn’t need to maim them as a means of demonstrating how gruesome he was. This point also applies to Jacob; the resistance could have consisted of him and his daughter and still had meaning; in fact it would have been more moving if there were only a handful of them instead of the dozens the game presented (those dozens effectively rendering their losses faceless and meaningless). Tomb Raider shouldn’t be about clearing a bloody battlefield with an assault rifle. It should be about tombs. The game’s notes did establish backgrounds for a handful of unseen characters; if these had come around as boss fights the story’s cohesion would have been improved greatly. It would also have made the fights more memorable (I honestly can’t remember several of the zones because they were run-and-gun).  Four: The collectibles. More tombs, fewer ‘hidden item’ counts, but more meaningful finds when you come across them. If the murals had been more significant, with each improving the language skill by one instead of slowly filling a bar, encountering them would have been more exciting and thus more memorable.  The game suffers from not being memorable. It’s a pity, because it easily could have been.",

There are positive factors like: - very good graphics - interesting environments - a lot of stuff to discover (more optional tombs for example)  To make it short, it is everything the first rebooted Tomb Raider (2013) was and more and better. So if you liked the predecessor then you will like this game too.  Now the downsides:  - The 'AI' is not just stupid... this is advanced stupidity, Enemies are only a threat when in great numbers, but not even then.... - The difficulty is a joke, the game is far too easy. Even on the higher diffulty settings - The puzzles in the tombs and other parts are also too easy... how stupid do the designers think we are Oo (It is worth mentioning that the puzzles are more elaborate than in the predecessor) - The focus is too heavy on shooting than on exploring (of course this strongly depends on your preferences) - The jumping and climbing passages are not well done, it is always plain obvious what you have to do  I didnt finished the game yet, the game says I have completed more then the half content. Since this is also counting collection optional stuff i assume I am at the last third of the story. Thus, I think the price is too high, because most of the play time goes into completing collections and gather crafting materials.  If you are unsure maybe wait for a sale. For lets say 30€ the game is worth it. Since, its not a bad game per se.",

Easy progressing, game is too forgiving, also causing animations' mess. + Some tombs were really challenging. - Enemies are really stupid.

Usually you need ape skills to get somewhere but enemies are everywhere. - Game forces you to visit already visited areas to fill achievements and also gather resources for upgrades. Well, some maps are very badly prepared for this. In common, when you play, you just know where to go. If you are there for the second time, you are just lost.

Well, let's place one there into solid rock, another one into ancient building which was sealed few centuries. Just WTF. - Drops. They are purelly random.

I feel like, at least for some people, this will put them off from the game--and I find it ironic that, in our PC climate, people are told not to talk bad about religion unless it is Christianity: thus this game, while not representing what I believe, does in some ways mock what millions of Christians the world over believe (overtly in some respects.)

            "review_text": "Ok let's get this out of the way first, If you're after something pretty to push your expensive PC to it's limits then this game delivers, some gorgeous scenery and some of the best facial animations i've ever seen. If you're after a good game at the same time your out of luck.  *Plot*  The plot sees Lara Croft, a mutant descendant of Wolverine carrying the regeneration mutation searching for an artifact called the divine source that can give others her miraculous healing capabilities. Her journey takes her to the mountains of siberia where Lara encounters a war with the natives and templars(err i mean 'trinity') and suffers from schrodinger's hypothermia alongside everything you would expect from a tomb raider plot. It's not amazing writing that invokes great thought but your playing tomb raider, what are you after? It does what it needs to. It is an improvement on the first game however, Lara isn't yet the film Badass yet but she doesn't switch between sobbing and bloodthirsty killer every 5 seconds, supporting characters aren't underdeveloped pieces of meat who are there purely to throw in whenever the writer feels Lara hasn't faced a 'hardship' in a while and there's a Little less physical abuse to Lara’s superhuman body. The game however has a habit of completely ignoring the concept of hypothermia until it's needed for the plot and as i've been joking about this whole paragraph, Lara at least doesn’t get impaled 20 minutes in but still manages to take multiple lethal multi story falls then procede walk off holding the wound and acting like a toddler waiting for mum to kiss a small scratch better and then forgetting about it 30 seconds latter. The game also suffers from overdoing the dramatic moments, when things are crumbling around you you're supposed to get a little adrenaline burst as you get through the tense moment. That doesn't work in Tomb raider though, the grounds falling apart beneath you, there's a chopper shooting at you but you're just holding W and tapping space with a mildly bored and noting how conveniently that rock just fell, there’s no tension after the 30th time.   *Game Word* The ‘open world’ is hardly open, it’s filled with plenty of annoying rocks, shrubs and moderately high walls and rubble to act as lazy ways to box the player in. The second act is a pain to navigate as the maps not particularly effective, it’s not open it’s a series of tracks really and coupled with the terrible map and lazy walls figuring out how to get back to that collectable is a pain. Thats right i said collectables! the same damn collectables and mini tasks that you’ve seen in every AAA open world game in the last few years. It’s boring, uninspired and just a lazy way to pad out game time. These tasks include hunting and looting to support your open world standard crafting system with the usual lazy story locks on items making it completely redundant to even have.  One good addition however has been optional challenge tombs, there’s about 9 or 10 of these and they each feature a puzzle that needs to be solved to unlock some interesting perks at the end, these aren’t particularly taxing but they are enjoyable.  *Gameplay*  there have been improvements in some areas but very little in others, it’s mostly the same though.  The bulk of the game sees you climbing things and this is something the game has not advanced at all in. Things that you can interact with all have very obvious and ‘gamey’ visuals to them, there’s the really crumbled rock you can climb up and ledges and walls covered in bird droppings that you can grab onto or jump up and things with perfectly preserved rope around them. These stick out like a sore thumb and continuously remind you you're playing a game. Assassin's Creed has shown how you can have perfectly climbable buildings and trees and still have them feel almost natural so it’s not like this sort of climbing is a new idea. this is coupled with terrible keyboard climbing controls that lead to leaping of a cliff routinely. Climbing feels like you’re just holding down a button as you move through an incredibly artificial looking track.   Combat has improved though, Lara can now dodge effectively between cover instead of hobbling about into gunfire and getting stuck for a moment before dying, there’s a bit more enemy variety and ways to play this time round instead of popping up and down behind a rock. Enemies don’t die from one hit in stealth then turn straight Boromir levels of arrow tankiness the moment they notice you, there’s a bit more variety in the combat and it doesn’t play like a cover based shooter anymore which is wonderful.  Stealth gameplay is fun with multiple ways to clear out a group of bad guys, slowly pick them off with arrows or throw in some explosives and pick off the last guy quickly, there's plenty of room for play. Sadly there are maybe 10 or so encounters like this in the game, it’s fun to do but there is just nowhere near enough moments to play around with stealth, this is especially sad when there are so many perks that provide fun ways to play with stealth.  As for the rest of the gameplay, it’s a AAA open world game. There’s messages and tips popping up constantly that end up feeling patronising and annoying after a while, it constantly gives you experience and levels up things. I understand this stuff is to keep the casual kiddies entertained with a drip feed of arbitrary rewards but to someone who plays games regularly it’s maddening and you just wish you could turn it all off and enjoy the game.    Is it worth full price, no i got it to oggle at the graphics but still felt let down. Will it be worth it on sale? for $15 to look at the graphics it’s a good deal but other than that it’s still not worth it for gameplay.",

            "review_text": ": This Review was written by: 'WishingWitch' a very good friend and fellow Steam customer :  Rise of the Tomb Raider 2016 turned out to be a complete disappointment  I got to know Lara Croft in 2013 in ‘Tomb Raider’. That game had all of my heart from the very first minutes. It had stunning plot and well thought out characters. They had charisma, goals, feelings and relationships. That story sucked me in and never let go. There was a couple of times (with a helicopter and a plane crash) when I thought that here it is, the rescue team, will finally take all of us out of that wired place. False hopes that caused real emotions! The end of the game was a complete surprise even though I made every possible effort to find all the little clues to what was going on that island. I didn’t just play it; I lived out the whole thing.  So I was anxious to see what happened to Lara after that. And I’m heavily disappointed. Game mechanics is simply taken from the previous part, nothing new. Characters appear and disappear randomly, without a story attached. And don’t even ask me about the plot. It’s simply missing. There is a small story to explain why Lara needs to go on that trip, but it’s hard to take it seriously and really believe. Who the hell is the prophet and what is Trinity? What do they want? Who are locals in Siberia? Lara sees some people randomly, but seems like they are homeless. I didn’t find even a tiny inhabitant village over there. Lara freezes in a decent coat and runs around the snowy hell in just one sweater absolutely comfortably. No relationships at all, no conversations, no character development in mental sense.   And I’m not even saying anything about the surroundings. That ‘strong soviet atmosphere’ they are forcing in this game makes me laugh (I’m from the Eastern bloc country). It’s so unnatural and so filled with stereotypes that the whole impression leads to the conclusion that the developers didn’t put any (tiny) effort in research, just started creating scenes.  So Ms. Croft is not a living character any more, she’s just a beautiful doll that can give a hard time to all enemies, that’s it. Visuals are great, but that didn’t save it for me. Stopped playing as well as streaming. May be one day on a beer party I’ll finish this journey.  P.S. Hope, ms. Rihanna Pratchett has nothing to do with the plot though; such a story would make her grandfather turn in his grave.",

People who “Just love it because it’s Tomb Raider” will not care\\agree (so most who are looking at this probably)  This game.... It's so bad. I would go as far to say that this game is blaring example of what's wrong with many (not all) AAA titles these days. I'm not often inspired to write negative game reviews, but after about an hour of this game I could not stomach anymore.  This is a gross ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of gaming concepts that have been rehashed time and time again over the past 8-10 years, all put together with a writing style of cliche 80’s B-movie. They put the guile of “puzzle” on it, but it’s silly and simple and frankly patronizing. It even offers you a “help me” mode that is insulting whenever it pops up. It pops up in painfully obvious times, as if you were about to use the bathroom and it feels it needs to remind you to pull down your pants, you know in case you forgot.  It feels like the dev team on this project cared about this title. It feels like they tried to incorporate key themes and values from the franchise and make something that would appeal to the Tomb Raider fanbase. The mechanics are what you would expect, the graphics are nice, the voice acting is solid. These are things you expect from a AAA title. If you compared this to getting a functional product from any professional environment, you can check off the box “Is thing that can be sold”. Good job.  This plays like a super generic hollywood blockbuster movie, every scene is super predictable, the concept has been seen 100 times before, the plot is stale, the characters are unrealistic and absurd, the “action sequences” (please note the quotes) are lots of button mashing made for consoles. If I want insane unrealistic but cool jumping around, I will play Assassins Creed, if I want focus based fix shooting I’ll play Mass Effect, so on and so on with games that did it. Giving me the simple rehash is just not fun.  Game developers, please stop making this smelly smelly junk, and start putting time into you products. You are pandering to the most common denominator, but if you try harder they will buy along with the large percentage that enjoys thoughtful and provocative gameplay. You have such talent and resources at your disposal, please stop making this trash. The best example I could give would be this: The worst show I could think of on “common TV” is Two broke girls, it averages 6 million views a week. Game of Thrones, something with good production value, story, and originality averages 20 million views (not counting the millions of pirated views). Don’t make Two broke girls, make Game of Thrones.

You just showed up in time to be kidnapped!') or very telegraphed ('this NPC is getting a lot of screentime, I wonder if he's plot important!').  More importantly, though, the concept and charm of seeing Lara grow up in the first game is gone. She's no longer an innocent archaeologist coming to terms with how brutal the world is: after the events of the first game she's already a veteran killer. Worse, what moves her is an obsession with her dead father rather than something that the player can easily empathize with, like surviving and escaping a cursed island.  After over 20 hours of play I simply got bored and gave up.",

I took the time to type all of this out, even ways how I would like the game to improve. Please don't dislike this review without reading it just because you might like the game yourself. I gave a lot examples on how I would like the series to improve and maybe you'll like my recommendations as well, or maybe for an entirely new series.  Good:  - There's parts of the game that look really nice (and other parts that were low detailed). - I like the weapons, tools, grappling, abilities, etc. - I didn't run into too many bugs.  Bad:  - The story. It's not that interesting and it's very vague. It's about Lara Croft and others searching for ancient treasure that makes a person immortal. Lara said she wants it to study it and share it with the world...? The antagonist wants to become immortal. The lame part was that they don't know where it is or if it's even real. The back story was bland. - The dialog and acting was way too overly dramatic and revolved around revenge. - Not enough enemies types. There's 3 types of enemies: wild animals, male mercenaries, and the cursed men in armor (they're just reskined male mercenaries). So, it's repetitive. - Not enough music, I was getting tired of the same music playing over and over. I felt the same way with Bioshock Infinite. - Lara always has perfect skin right after a bloody battle to the death, then acts so chill about almost dying. She doesn't experience trauma apparently or at least for more than 2 seconds other than being sad about her dad dying when she was young. (not really a spoiler) - I didn't like how there's too many 'close call' instances throughout the game and also how everything she touches breaks instantly. - Lara's mouth doesn't move when she talks at times.  This game is like other treasure hunter stories where the antagonist and protagonist are simultaneously going after the same treasure. I think it would have been nice if it wasn't as linear and if the dialog wasn't overly dramatic. I would have liked more stuff similar to the concept art. This game focused too much on killing bad guys just like Tomb Raider (2013).   How to I would make improve the game: I think there should be an open world wilderness where you have to survive. Rarely, you come across abandoned buildings and towns that you can explore. You have to hunt for food, kill wild animals attacking you, and sleep (kind of like The Long Dark). There's also notes, books, and people that hints towards the locations of tombs. As you explore, you learn more stuff about the areas and it's secrets. You stumble across ancient ruins and temples that are much bigger than you expect. Each area has a different appearance, story, enemies, monsters, and music. So the game would be very diverse. It would also have a good story too that ties everything together. The characters would act to things realistically, for example in The Last of Us they had conversations that made the characters more alive.  Example of diversity between areas: 1. An ancient civilization at the bottom of an enormous, dark abyss with creepy mechanical monsters that crawls on the walls of buildings. 2. An ancient underwater civilization with evil mermaids and other weird sea stuff, also would be cool if there was bioluminescence. 3. An ancient civilization in an extinct volcano with slender man-like phantoms. Guns don't have any affect on them.. it's something else. 4. An ancient civilization in a valley covered with a invasive little flowers (like kudzu vines) which has fumes that makes Lara go completely crazy, seeing things that aren't there and having to fight that. There would be a bunch of these areas and each place would last around 3-6 hours of gameplay, maybe more. Pretty much, it would be an open world survival game mixed in with fantasy horror, exploring weird places, treasure hunting, and puzzle solving. I think that would be a lot more interesting and fun to play.",

Wouldn't the blade turn sideways even a bit? Bounce off due to loss of force? I get hammering it in (and getting a sound of pouring sand out of a bag) but throwing it? With a wire? You play as Lara Croft not Peter Parker.  These are the major things which ruin the experience for me so far. A couple of annoying details that shouldn't have made it through a beta make the game feel unprofessional, not to mention they're easily fixed.  1) When I pull out my bow the AK on my back disappears. When I pull out the AK the bow disappears. 2) Very bad sound handling. Lips are not synched with voices and the whole thing feels amateurish. 3) Why can I attach a grenade to an arrow but not chuck the grenade? 4) Why must I wait for a campsite to be able to craft new upgrades? 5) If I have a combat knife and a pikaxe on my belt and an AK in my hand, why do I pull out my bow to strangle someone with it as a melee attack? This feels like a half finished 'attack with the current weapon' mechanic that got dropped but still found itself in the final game. 6) Why can I not pick up an enemy's weapon?

There are tons of examples, but here's one: You have to climb to a ledge 5 feet above you. Now, there is all kinds of what would be climbable cobblestone (IRL) right under the ledge, but instead you have to spend a lot of time raising and lowering water levels with different switches and what not, to flood the room so you could grab the ledge from a swimming position instead of just climbing it. Another example is that you need rope arrows to pull down small walls when you could have just been able to use the climbing axe to do the same.  The puzzles are just plain dumb in this regard, and there are tons of them, making advancement in the game and story very frustrating and time consuming. Another thing is all the stupid relics you find randomly spread in boxes in the most unthinkable places, which makes no sense. And these relics rewards nothing but some XP and there are literally hundreds of them. Another time consuming matter.  The game focuses alot more on puzzles, relics, tape recordings and other lootable nonsense than on the story itself, which is sad because the story is as I've said pretty amazing.  The game world is very good though, and somewhat open. The crafting system is ok and rewarding.  I would not play this game again, due to the sheer time consuming and nonsensical stuff that has no relations to the game.

I dropped my settings to high switched everything else off and still get frame rate drops, but less regular.  Its playable if you like to be bored out of your tree and like regular glitching and unresponsive controls.  Don't get me started on lara's pony tail wagging like a dog even indoors with no wind lol.  Another tripple A joke.  I highly recommend you save your money and watch this rise of the tomb raider drama DVD on youtube with somebody that has two 980 ti's sli, because thats what it takes to play this MUCK on ultra!",

The game is well written so far and Lara is such a likeable and developed character. Why the bad review? This game has crashed my display drive 3 times in the hour I played, meaning that the game would crash the monitor and would require a hard reboot. I have looked it up so I know I am not the only one that this happens to.",

However, the game missed out on making the gameplay thrilling and the overall story interesting.  The major setback of the game is that it fails to meet the expectations of the players that have played the 2013 game. I found that there were hardly any puzzels in it, which is one of the major things that i missed in this game. What i missed in the gameplay was probably the 'survival' feeling. Furthermore, the story made Lara look a bit overpowered.  Close combat was also very rare. Oh and one more thing....why does Lara look so old!",

Early combat: Ultra clunky, definitely no grace at all. Gears of war, cover fire style.  Mid game: They ramp up the complexity and the levels are linear to help guide the character, but non linear in that you need to look everywhere. Nice :) Mid Combat: fortunately there isn't much.  Late Game: exploration is unrewarding, but you get a cool tool thats fun to use in the levels! Late Combat: It still sucks, but i got used to it to some degree.  Overall: Character dialog and choices are very cinematic and non realistic. Lots of Eye rolling. So shooting hundreds of enemies is fine (not to mention the hundreds she brutally killed in the previous game), but she gets all emo and hesitant when a main baddie is around?  I'm just glad that the wussy lara story line is done now, so we can get back to the real lara! I honestly wouldn't tell my friends to buy this game... but its your choice, those are my impressions, i hope it helps you get an idea of what to expect!",

I have pre-ordered the game and the season pass, and thats how you treat your customer for pre-ordering? 3. 980 TI for 1440p? Are you serious? I have Gigabyte G1 980 ti, and I coudn't get 60fps on max settings even on 1080p with G-Sync enabled! I had approximately 40-45fps average with dips to 30fps. What the hell?  This is awfull. I am lost for words. I've bought and played the original game and definitive edition on different platforms. It was great! But this... how is it possible? I've played my friend's xbox one copy of the game and I enjoyed it. I was waiting to get the best game experience on pc, and this stuff happens. I am deeply dissapointed by this treatment, and I doubt that I will purchase something else from this company.  DO YOU FEEL BLAME? ARE YOU MAD?",

Why does she get hurt and why is this such linear garbage. I only buys these fames when they go down to 15 dollars and event hen i feel like i paid too much for this fetish of a game. I hope that in the next installment they dont just hurt your player modael ever 2 minutes and force you to type away at you keyboard to survive these borring cutscenes. I always let Lora die after a while and jump off of mountains because that is alot better than playing Typist the game.
