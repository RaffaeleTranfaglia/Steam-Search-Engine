            "review_text": "A wonderful remake of the Atari 8 bit classic Archon. Graphics and sound are fine, but it's the great gameplay that makes this game so enjoyable.  The original Archon only had one game board and no campaigns. This game has many different game boards and some interesting and challenging campaigns. I've put a lot of hours into the campaigns and more than got my moneys worth.",

            "review_text": "A fun little time waster, providing a simple to grasp system with great depth and variation through the many different boards. The units are smart, balanced, leading to fantastically tense gameplay on occasions. However, the games style, taking a board game and a real time arena fight make it unconventional as board game style videogames go, and I would really say it appeals more to the side of me that likes turn based RPGs and old arcade and micros games. Its a worthwhile buy in any case if you want to spend a few minutes thinking and slaying in equal measures.",

            "review_text": "This game is 10 cases of epic. Yes, it's a 2D Chess game, but it's BATTLE CHESS. You literally fight each other using the chess pieces in a 1v1 combat match for each piece. This is easily one of the most fun simple games I've ever played. I paid $1 for it during the Steam Summer Sale, but I would've gladly paid up to $10 for it. That's how awesomely fun it is.   Note that I did play with my nephew locally, so it may not be as fun if you don't play with other real people.",

It's has the original with vastly improved graphics over the original 8-bit version, and quite a few new features and game modes.   This is a game of strategy, and it's deep but very simple to learn. Lightning fast reflexes and great timing are probably most important, as long as you pick the terms of a fight.  Try to fight on dark squares if you are the dark side, and light squares if you are the light side, for a big advantage. Don't leave your best pieces on the wrong color tile or they may get killed in 1-hit.  No online multiplayer is a huge missing feature; other than that this game is solid. Fun and addictive.",
