            "review_text": "This is my favorite videogame, and I've played quite a few. I'm glad it's finally on Steam.  The journey to the Lands of Dream is one you must take yourself: You have to live it,  be  there, to understand. I recommend it to you, especially if you like point 'n' click adventures and slower-paced games. Take your time, explore, examine every nook and cranny, talk with all the lovable characters (which have actual depth, instead of being one-dimensional caricatures), and just enjoy the experience.",

Slow down my friend, here's a world you got to explore, take the time to read, understand, laugh, cry, feel awkward... I had to rethink the way I approached video games to be able to fully experience what the game and dev wanted me to experience.  I've been on steam for years and I never wrote a single review. You who are reading this right now, I invite you. Drop the Xbox controller, close that AAA game, stop that rage quitting platformer and enter a world where time stops and where you can marvel at everything.  Oh, and it's full of social science references.",

            "review_text": "This a very strange and charming per-screen-based first person view point and click adventure game that has surprisingly good writing, strange quirky humour and interesting life and philosophy musings. This is also the first commercial game from the same writer that brought you the story of The Talos Principle, which is probably a selling point of it's own.  This game... well, this portal to a different world is quite peculiar. It's full of buttons and switches, some of which are helpful and some of which make funny noises. And that different world is both surprisingly charming and funny and quite painfully real. Full of quite unexpectidly well put pop culture references (so many games fail at maintaining their own feel while doing this, after all), weird creatures and unpleasant bureaucracy.  There are moments of 'okay now what', and it does want you to calm down and pay attention to everything and not click through text, so it requires a specific mood and mindset to be enjoyable properly. But when you're ready for it (or, more like - you THINK you're ready for it), The Sea Will Claim Everything is a joy. Mouse thinks it's a bit overrated, though.",

            "review_text": "Jonas Kyratzes, one of the writers of The Talos Principle, with the whimsical art of his wife Verena and the music by Chris Christodoulou (who did the music for Risk of Rain) united together to make a wonderful game.  The Sea Will Claim Everything is a very special and rare game that combines the exploration of a fantastic and creative world with interesting and deep analysis of modern economical and political problems.  Partially inspired by the economic crysis that struck Greek, and still holds many european countries, this magnificent game explore with a slow pace and a biting humour many unresolved problems of this situation, still aknowledging the difficulty of resolving it.  On top, or besides this, the game itself is the story of a wonderful group of magical island, whose beauty and existence is menaced. Kyratzes manages to write an interesting, moving, eccentric, dramatic and fun story, such as is life.  A truly interesting experience, with excellent music and wonderfully represented, that I suggest to experience slowly, and if needed be, with a tutorial if you encounter any empasse. Do buy it.",
