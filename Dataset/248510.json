    "description": "The Old God has left the world and the pretenders are awakening and coming out from hiding. You start the game by designing one of the pretender gods that will compete for true ascension to godhood. The type of god can range from a magically powerful arch mage to an ancient kraken or a mystic monolith that people pray to.",

            "review_text": "Dominions 3 stands as one of my favorite strategy games of all time. It's not really that similar to anything else; the combat is all automatic, and your main job (as a god) is to manage your empire, build armies, build forts, research and cast spells, and plan out where your armies will go.   The graphics are sufficient for the job they do, and there's a plethora of addtional mods and maps and what not available for it.   All told, i quite recommend it to any fans of strategy who are looking for something a little different.",

            "review_text": "Note: This review only reflects single player. Some of the concerns should be equally valid in multiplayer tho.   Pro: - lots of nations and spells to play with  Contra:  - no upgrade path except for magic, you start and end the game with the exact same troops  - larger empires are micromanagement nightmares (commander limits, picking up scattered units, managing troop supplies for fronline armies etc on a 45 province map is already horrible) - tedious mopping up of beaten opponents (hopefully you didnt pick low dominion while trying to assault a water fortress with Shamblers ...) - hands off battles  - almost non existent province development  And just as a side note there isnt really a steep learning curve, its just that you have to memorize spells and units or you will be looking up those all the time. Games like Chess and Go can offer a deep strategic experience without overboarding rule complexity. Dominions while initially fun becomes tedious and boring very quickly.",
