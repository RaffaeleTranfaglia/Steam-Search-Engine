            "review_text": "This little indie 2d space rogue-like turn-based strategy game is strangely addicting.   By all rights, it's not a very well polished game. There are lots of spelling errors, fairly simple graphics, and issues with controls. However, all that being said, I spent a good deal of time playing it. Though I didn't play it exclusively. I spent most of the time playing this game watching TV shows on Netflix as well. So keep that in mind.   Game play is fairly simplistic, but as you progress you keep that progression of your character. I don't believe it's possible to complete the game on the first play through, similiar to Rogue Legacy. As you progress, your character gets stronger and takes their traits with them for the next play through.   Each time you start, you begin with basic equipment, and as you take down enemies you loot their technology, giving your ship an advantage. The AI is pretty simplistic, so don't expect great tactics from the enemies. The more you play the more you undersand how the enemy ships work.   The achievements will take some time to get as you need to become strong enough before you can attain some of them.   The ending I've seen wasn't the best, and the story was very simplistic. Either way, it's still a fun play while doing other things.   Overall: 6.2/10 - It's worth the dollar cost, though you can get it on sale or in a bundle.",

            "review_text": "This is an interesting little space roguelike made in a free version of unity. It has promise, but may not be worth your time.  Pros: Cheap. At the time of purchase this only cost 15 cents. Decent help. The help screens if you flip through them do a pretty good job of explaining how to play. Some of the art assets are OK.  Cons: This is a very rough around the edges product. There is a lot of polish missing. Small spelling errors throughout ('sacrifise', '3 enemies is approaching', etc.) Gameplay itself is both easy and boring, and yet also tedious. You start off slow and will be hitting the end turn button a lot. The map does not scroll with you which gets annoying as soon as you can move faster. The art is pretty bad in many cases. The font is too large. The whole game feels designed for a phone and not for a PC. The later gear does not have clear descriptions, and there are no pop-up or context menus on anything. This means that figuring out what new gear does is a matter of trial and error. Now you CAN flip gear back and forth for free, so this helps. Sometimes I noticed no difference from equipping a new piece of gear. A story is told, but you have no input, and I found myself quickly skipping past the screens. Needing to quit a level and 'lose all progress' to spend skill points quickly gets annoying.   At the end of the day it isn't bad for someone's first try at a game. This is not the sort of project that should be sold, unless you like paying for someone else to learn game design. The game is boring, easy and tedious with poor artwork. It feels like a school project.  3/10",

            "review_text": "This is a fairly average Unity engine 2D game.   Some recognition is deserved for the complexity of the gameplay, but at the end of the day, it's simplistic with mediocre graphics and nothing much to engage the player and draw them into the game.  While the game includes a few pages of instructions, these are tedious to flip through, a tutorial would have worked much better.  Ultimately the game had potential, but the delivery was flat. It just doesn't come across as fun. You'd be better off finding an ancient copy of Master of Orion.",
