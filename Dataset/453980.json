However when the aircraft is fully upgraded, you move on the next set of stages and fly a new aircraft with no upgrades. - Very clunky menus Overall a very poorly designed and executed game.",

It's a fun game, pretty simple, drop bombs, level buildings, get powerups! But there's a good deal of patience or timing skill required, and it's a good game! Easily worth the time to get achievements. IDK Maybe they made it tougher since other people reviewed, but it's definite fun imo and not too easy, particularly for games in the casual genre!  Editing to add: I really like the weather effects (screenshot taken &amp; uploaded) so that might be an additional bias to the theme on my part, but seriously this is a 'play for yourself,' if you aren't grinning/enjoying in the first 15 minutes, it's not your thing, but I can't put it down ;)",

            "review_text": "  Airstrike HD is a simple game and doesn't try to advertise itself as anything more than that - At least that's the impression I got out of it.  A few things that irritated me through playing merely half an hour into it: The take-off and landing 'cutscenes' should have some way to fast forward or skip them to get right into the game itself. Trying to tackle specific achievements, screwing up, and having to do it over again can make it get very annoying very quickly.   Another huge issue I had were the powerups. It seemed like a majority of the time, you can easily pass through levels without ever grabbing them, and in all honesty it's probably better if you don't. You rarely, if ever, will need the items that help you, but the items that hinder you are FAR more unforgiving, you can go from easily beating the level to automatically losing as soon as the item is grabbed. A good game would have some kind of insurance so challenge the player to work at completing the level, but these just seem like the developers went for more of the, 'Oops you hit the box guess you lost this round ;-)' route instead.The item I seem to always hit is the pink reset item, which basically feels like the game raises a giant middle finger at you and tells you to play the entire level over again, even if you were only a few drops from completing it. Oh but don't worry - Your insignificant score will remain.  The upgrade system is also very weak. It's the same thing with each world (pass a level, get a little perk), and you don't even get the most useful ones until you face the boss (which you can destroy in one shot, without it even trying to attack you). Why not have a system where the score is instead replaced with a currency, where we can spend this money to upgrade plane bodies, wings, bombs, etc? It's a concept we've been seeing in free flash games for years now, and a game like this underachieves in this regard?  I realize these are very nit-picky, but the bottomline I'm trying to get at is Airstrike HD is no better than your standard internet game you can find for free anywhere else. I'm not sure why this game has a price tag at all. But because it is asking money, I would imagine these little things would have been given more thought, instead of just a glorified flash game with repeated and stale levels.",
