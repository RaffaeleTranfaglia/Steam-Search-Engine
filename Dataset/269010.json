The game itself could need some design polish, couple of mistakes, simple plot and shallow characters. However Science Girls is not a bad game and do recommend to try and play if you love RPG game.

As I was playing it, the characters kept 'teaching' me things and at first I thought it was bad writing, but then I realized this game was trying to educate kids and that just made it so cute like in a very sincere way. I think a kid around 9-12 that likes RPGs would probably get their money's worth out of this game or anyone else that appreciates sincere but ultimately low quality indie titles.",
