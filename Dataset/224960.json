    "description": "Adventurer Lara Croft has been hired to recover the pieces of an ancient artifact known as the Scion. With her fearless acrobatic style she runs, jumps, swims and climbs her way towards the truth of its origin and powers - leaving only a trail of empty tombs and gun-cartridges in her wake.",

I decided to replay this.  What an advanture! I did complete this game about 20 years ago and this time I did it in 1 go.... When I solving those puzzle so many unexpect childhood memory that I have long forgotten flow back to me and that's a wondful experience.  A Master piece and all time classic.  However I can only recommend this to old school fan. since: 1. Control is hard and less responsive and hard to manage then newer Tomb raider game. 2. Music is good but lack variety of new generation of games. 3. Graphics has aged quite a bit and younger kids now days won't like it any more. 4. Have to save and load way too offen cause this game is really really hard and sometime there are multiple hard jumps. if you don't want to lose your progress.. Save Offen!  Anyhow for rating... For old time classic 10/10. For modern day enjoyment 7.5/10",

            "review_text": "The game that started it all. it might seem primitive by today's standards, but believe it or not - it's still mind boiling and fun to play even today. If you're reading this then you've definitely already heard about the series, so there's not much of a point to recommend. It's a must play category title with great level design and soundtrack. The game takes place in 4 differently themed locations (so it doesn't get boring), each location has at least 3 levels. There's also a free expansion pack called 'Unfinished Business' that has 4 extra levels (PC exclusive).  While TR is certainly not a realistic game (finding medipacks and ammo in tombs) I couldn't imagine it being different. You have to sacrifice a bit of realism to keep the game fun and entertaining. For the most hard working / curious explorers each level has at least one secret. Depending on the secret you may get ammo, medipacks or even a new weapon (early access in a way).  The PC version isn't as good as the PlayStation version, considering that the PC version was released for DOS it lacks some features. It runs through DosBox, resolution can be increased but it's not the best experience. Everything is fixable as long as you're using 3rd party software such as Glidos. It enhances the game visually and also restores it's original audio quality. You can play it at pillarboxed 1080p without any problems at all.",

            "review_text": "What most people remember from this ancient relic of a title - fast approaching its twentieth anniversary at the time of writing - is an unassuming level called the Lost Valley. Ms Croft, far from the first female video game protagonist but arguably the most influential, runs through a short cave system not dissimilar to that of the opening levels, and gracefully swan dives into a pool from the very top of a waterfall. As Lara, you indiscriminately kill a few wolves, and then you find yourself in this expansive, jungle-like environment. The pitch black darkness above - the result of hardware limitations at the time - was intended to imply an outdoor, night time environment. It doesn’t quite pull it off, and you might feel like you’re still in a cave, miles underground, shrubs and trees inexplicably growing all around you. One thing’s for sure, though - you’re entirely alone.   But not for long. Two creatures attack, on top of you so quickly you hardly have time to register it. You push on, hoping there’s not more of them - the earlier Tomb Raider games had a genuine fear factor to them, a genuine sense of vulnerability - and just as you’re about to pass under a broken bridge, wondering what might have caused such destruction, the screen starts to shake. The tense musical cue kicks in*, and then it appears. A huge polygon monstrosity roars at you with not-quite CD quality sound, and then it’s up to you - fight or flight.   What makes this so notable a moment in the present day is that the Lost Valley was the third level of a fifteen level game. The Tyrannosaurus Rex does not act as a bookend for the game, or even for the level itself. It is not part of some grand set piece, or even an epic boss fight - provided you can avoid the damn thing’s jaws, a gunfight will last about twenty seconds, and yes, you can even beat the level without killing it at all.   What we have here is game design from an era where things weren’t focus-tested into banality, when developers implemented outstandingly memorable moments without basing an entire game around it. A T-Rex in Level Three suggests a time when developers could, in short, do close to whatever they wanted. Dinosaurs wandering around Peru? Well, sure, why the hell not? Jurassic Park had come out three years prior, and dinosaurs were the next big thing in entertainment. It didn’t necessarily make a lot of sense for Tomb Raider, from a contextual standpoint or a gameplay standpoint, but somehow, it worked. And Tomb Raider’s full of moments like that - our heroine’s making her way through a mutant-infested Atlantis, complete with fleshy, pulsating walls, and then she enters what appears to be… an underground skateboard park? And sure enough, someone’s riding towards her, skateboard under his feet, twin Uzis in his hands, spitting out a remark that seem to be an almost-quote from Taxi Driver (“You firing at me? You firing at me?!”).   These days are long gone. If you’re going to put dinosaurs in a game, dinosaurs have to *make* the game. You certainly can’t go putting a T-Rex in the third level. And forget murderous skaters altogether. You’d have half your audience scratching their heads. For better or for worse, consistency and logic are cornerstones of modern gaming - triple A and indie alike, I’d argue - and the times when developers could truly put an idea in their game “just because” are over. For those who can handle the archaic controls and dated visuals**, Tomb Raider remains well worth playing today. More recent Tomb Raider titles provide the same exotic locations and eclectic blend of platforming, exploration and combat as the original, but they often feel like you’re strapped into the seat of a rollercoaster - it's frequently breathtaking, but you're very much on a set path. For that reason, it’s the original 1996 release that has me coming back whenever I want a fix of the exotic, the surreal, and the often downright bizarre.   Tomb Raider. Come for the dinosaurs. Stay for the gun-totting skateboarder.   *Strangely, this Steam version of Tomb Raider seems to lack musical cues such as the one signalling the appearance of the Tyrannosaurus Rex. I’m not sure if this is my setup, but other cues, such as Lara’s voiceovers during the tutorial in her mansion home, play fine.   **The Steam version of Tomb Raider provides the smoothest graphical setup I’ve seen for the game, providing texture qualities not far removed from late-generation PS1 games, or even early Dreamcast titles. Unfortunately, it also introduces occasional screen tearing, clipping and pop-up/draw distance issues.",

            "review_text": "First of all, yes, this game does desperately need an update for new systems. I didn't finish it for just that reason. That is to say, the game runs alright on modern systems, but uses a downright bad DosBox emulator which crashes whenever the Windows key (or a few others) is pressed, which is especially annoying given the fact that particular key falls squarely in-between two of the most commonly used buttons in the game. One slightly wrong move and you've blown it. Also factor in the 1996-era computer graphics and controls (which are particularly notably bad here, as you not only have the all-too-common directional issues of the era that always make me wonder how we didn't pull our hair out, but also a character that sometimes downright refuses to jump and move in a given direction at the same time), and this game is particularly dated and as such is at times frustrating. These are definitely cons which, depending how you feel about playing classic games from the period, could be a deal-breaker.  Yet, I do still recommend it for those who want the original experience of playing one of the best games of the Lara Croft series, and have the patience and ability to do so. Unfortunately, the graphics of the period are particularly hard on the eyes, so if you have vision issues like I do, be prepared for the possibility of extra strain. But, while it is old, it is still very much the game that you might remember, frustrations and all. The game is immersive, the puzzles and encounters engaging, and it simply feels like a genuinely death-defying Lara Croft adventure (though, admittedly, some of the challenge of defying death comes strictly from the poor controls) where one truly is free and forced to jump, climb, shoot (though there is auto-targeting as long as you're facing the right direction, or it'd be downright impossible with these controls), and dangle with the unforgiving precision necessary to survive. If there's one thing games of the era tended to get right compared to today, it is definitely the lack of hand-holding despite the inferior controls. This is a true adventure game.  Overall, though highly dated, it is a truly great game, and one that would serve the series very well as a future remaster rather than the modern inferior sequels they keep releasing.",

Well they do now! This is just the regular vanilla version of the game and Doesnt include certain updates nor the ability to install the Unfinished Business Expansion that Eidos gave away for free.

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider is a game I returned to with eyes glazed with nostalgia. I do this every few years with various things I liked as a tween, Linkin Park, being another prime example, before remembering that my 12 year old self wasn't actually that bright.  That's not to say Tomb Raider is bad. It's just aged pretty badly, early 90's 3D makes Lara look like she's been carved out of wood and she always tends to be trying to merge with the scenery. Environments aren't much better, in the back of your head, you're always vaguely aware that the whole game seems to be built on a grid, (every block the same size, etc). So aesthetically it's crap, but how does it play?  Moderately badly now you mention it. To be fair Lara does control extremely well for running around, making huge leaps, somersaulting and shooting. It's when the game gets into the second act and the fiddly jumps come in that the controls become a problem. If you, like me, played Tomb Raider back before the iPod was invented then you probably remember with fondness the screaming masogynistic curses you would yell at Lara as she dived into a spike pit instead of the desired ledge. It is not actually that fun reliving said experience.  My final gripe is actually hard to describe. (some background) I got all the old Tomb Raiders in a steam sale and binged on them over a weekend off, (this is the best of the lot) and I started to get this nagging feeling. The same feeling I got while playing too much Diablo 2: 'it's all the same.' you are doing the same thing over and over. Theres not much game here really, just a series of levers you have to pull in the correct order. That combined with the ugliness and the frustration drove the final nail into the nostalgia coffin.  Having said all that, it's still a great game and definately worth £4.99. The reason for this is similar to the reason I like similarly hideous game 'Deus Ex'. Because it's ugly as sh*t the designers could make pretty much whatever they wanted. The game is loooooooong, the variety is fantastic and the different locales are great. the game is packed with highlight set pieces, like the T-rex attack, the colosseum fight, the Sphinx, a statue turning Lara into gold, Atlantis city and a certain (very vertical) level in which you must pass the challenges of the gods. That's the reason I kept coming back to the shoddier sequels. For that sense of adventure I shared with a woman with an extremely impractical set of mammary glands.",

Apart from the graphics, another hark-back to the golden era of 16-bit gaming is the lack of hand-holding. The levels can be huge, the puzzles daunting and without a map, the game can be a formidable challenge to the novice gamer - as it was even 20 years ago.  Looking at Tomb Raider 1 in 2015 things like door switches can seem wholly illogical, even nonsensical. But approach each game level as a conceptual puzzle set-piece, and one can see it has more in common with games like The Talos Principle than the Tomb Raider reboot.  The player controls, considering the games age, have arguably aged well once you've mastered them. Compared to TR1's contemporaries such as Deathtrap Dungeon, Syphon Filter and Soul Reaver, Lara Croft's animations - to be able to somersault and shoot simultaneously (and later 360 degree turns in the air), were incredibly underrated and advanced for the time.  Tomb Raider 1 is a Classic in every sense. Gameplay, music and yes, the graphics, will always hold a special place in the hearts of adventure gamers the World over.",

Because the PC version is for DOS, you can only use a 4 button controller. I imagine there is a way to use a controller with more buttons but it seems like a lot of hassle. The PC version does have better graphics than the Playstation version.  I recommend getting the Playstation version instead if you can.",

            "review_text": "As most elderly folk will remember, Tomb Raider 1 was highly innovative when it was released. It's all all-time classic, considered a milestone in graphics and inventive gameplay, and helped shape the beloved tradition of starring eye-pleasing females in video games.  Is it worth revisiting? Yes and no. The levels are incredibly repetitive; cave walls and temples are all you will see. You will spend hours dragging blocks and running back and forth between switches, ever finding little if any resistance from enemies. Also, are 4 different weapons really enough in our homicidal gaming world? You don't even get the uzis until the 12th level! The challenge lies in the unforgivable controls, where delayed jumping mechanics and treacherous distances make a two-headed monster you will come to respect, love and hate.  I feel that rating this game above the sequel, Tomb Raider 2, would be based on sentiment rather than content, but that remains one guy's opinion. Even if it is a good one. In conclusion: the game is definitely worth replaying for those of us who had the chance to experience the golden era of PS1, but I would not recommend this game to a new player, even if they are into the franchise.  Groke out!",

It is a wonderful adventure, exploration and platformer game. The story is a little lacking and somewhat confusing. I thought I would be noting the horrible controls since I had remembered Tomb Raider games having such horrible controls, but I didn't find them to bad once I learned what each button did. I don't know what Tomb Raider game in my past gave me this problem, but it wasn't this one. It was many years ago as well and my ability in games may have improved.

But everything else is in such good order that you will very quickly be fully immersed. The visuals will melt away and what you'll be left with is one of the most fantastic adventures in gaming history. Bar none.  Pros The Tomb Raider franchise almost certainly requires no introduction and this first game in the series is, in my opinion, its best. When gaming made its transition from 2D to 3D and from cartridges to optical media, Tomb Raider took astounding advantage of both. The adventure is a sprawling epic that gifts players with a good many hours of challenging gameplay. The environments are interesting and varied. The puzzles and object hunts meld well with their contexts and level objectives. The plot is fairly well developed and the dialogue is appropriately cheeseball. The music and ambient sound, however, are extraordinary, even by today's standards. Among the very best I have ever heard, period.  Cons The only criticism I would make of Tomb Raider - and it is very rarely a hinderance to enjoyable gameplay - is that the camera is a little wonky when Lara is in tight quarters. This can make pathfinding a little rough on occasion. Other than that and the understandably dated 3D graphics, however, the game is, to me, practically flawless.  Setup Like a good many old school games here on Steam, Tomb Raider is delivered as a DosBox configuration, fully packaged and ready to go. The team even went through the trouble of including a Glide emulator with the game, allowing the enhanced 3DFX graphics engine to provide a 640x480 resolution and mipmapping. I strenuously recommend upgrading this to the very accessible nGlide by a fellow called Zeus. It has me running the game at 4K resolution with tweaked gamma and I have to say, the result is stunning.

            "review_text": "BEFORE YOU READ I DID PLAY ON PS1 AND THIS WAS FAR BETTER, IT JUST DOES NOT FEEL LIKE A GOOD PC GAME SO MY REVIEW STANDS AS IT IS THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING.   *sigh*....    I came into TOMB RAIDER with pretty high expectations after hearing about what a great game it was... and dear Lord was I mistaken.   Never, and I mean NEVER, have I played a game that felt so unpolished, so.. incomplete... even Sniper Elite V2 was better than THIS, and I hate Sniper Elite V2.    Taking into mind that this is an old game, I must say it was most likely a genre changing, ground-breaker of a game when it arrived on shelves, but it did not age well. The controls feel more like something out of an old arcade machine, and not the good ones. I mean one of those untouched, unheard of fighting games with about ten buttons for punching and kicking each, and some of the worst receptivity you'll ever play with. I was literally saving every platform I jump I made, and that is preettty bad when most of this game's puzzles involve platforming. You have to hit and hold three buttons at a time to jump and latch onto a platform, and if you do not hit those buttons at exactly the same time, then you either jump incorrectly or don't latch on, and this... oh this is bad. This should be fixed, she should automatically latch on when you jump, or atleast jump in the direction you move. Surely they had the technology to do this at that point in time, right? Then even worse is her BASIC movement. Yes, Lara's basic steps and turns are so bad it makes some of the game almost unplayable. When she steps forward she moves about 3-5 feet, and when she moves back she does this annoying hop that goes about 5 feet back. This becomes even more nerve-racking when you take into consideration that ANY type of movement left or righ can result in a rol, cartwheel, or side-jump that messes you up 80 percent of the time. This breaks most of the game (at least for me), and makes it darn near almost unplayable.   Then there is the fighting/shooting and obtaining/activating items. This is not as bad as platforming, but pretty close in it's own rite. To pick up on item, you have to face it, stand directly in front of it and press 'use'. This sounds easy, until you take into mind she moves about 5 feet every step she makes, making this beyond tedious. Then when you must activate an item such as a lever, they want it to be almost exactly on point, and this is more of a pain because most items you must activate are small and hard to get Lara to stand in front of, which makes overall interaction with your enviornment annoying and a pain. The when you shoot, there is a horrid auto-aim mechanic that just makes her swing in circles over and over when enemies move, and she generally stays locked on, so when that enemy is dead, you can bet she'll stil lbe standing there shooting it's dead body. This is somewhat humorous... but a pain in the butt. Generally you are being attacked by 2 or more enemies, so shooting the dead body just ends up getting you killed, and her reflexes are horrible, so turning usually results in more attacks from your enemies, and a dead Lara. This is very tedious, and I do not know how the developers left it like this, and just makes me think even more that this game is cheap and half-way done.   To end, the game has no soundtrack. Yep, none. The only thing you hear is a looped boom and crumble-like sound that just makes the pretty repetitous and bland enviornments even more so. This not only adds to the overall boredome this game provides, but makes it very annoying to play, and I am thankful the developers at least added the option to turn it off.   Overall, this could have been AMAZING... but because of bad aging and horrible PC controls, it is a horrid train-wreck of an excuse for a 'game'. The only really good factor is it's saving mechanism, considering it actually functions quite well and is quite fast. Overall i'd give this a 3/10, considering the amount of happiness you fel when you actually get the games mechanics down to a point. For anyone other than die-hard TOMB RAIDERS, i'd say stay away from this game at all costs.",

The game literally starts it's own DOS prompt (using DOSbox) and launches. It does not run natively within windows. It's not a deal breaker, just annoying. In order to get the game into full screen or change any settings concerning graphics, input mapping, ect.... you have to alt+tab out of the game and get into DOSbox, change the settings you like, and then continue.  Second: DOSbox does not correctly recognize joysticks or controllers. I've been using my PS3 Sixaxis controller for playing many games. Almost all PC games I've played work just fine with the controller. Not so much with this game. In fact, only 4 buttons on my controller work.  Lastly: (And this is very important) There is no clear way that I have found to change the keyboard mapping. 'WASD' can be set to move your character around, but you have to use buttons for the camera too! There is no mouse support for this game. (It runs in DOS) Which leaves you fumbling around just to make simple jumps. I never made it as far as any combat, though I'm sure that would have been a real pain in the rear.  To conclude: Skip this one. I got it as part of a bundle, so I don't feel too bad for grabbing it. But seriously, skip it. Find it elsewhere. Find a better port. Pull out that old grey PlayStation sitting in your closet and scrounge EBay for an origional disc. Just whatever you do, do not willingly buy this game.",
