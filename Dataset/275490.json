BUT this game just doesn't feel right in 2014 on PC &amp; I give retro games usually good scores. Although it might be an okay mobile game for along the way, or for children up to the age of 6.   Pros:  + good controls  (slow, old school feeling)  + okay ost + okay gameplay + trading cards   Cons:  - no atmosphere - boring - doesn't make fun - collecting jewels&amp;chests - simply not contemporary - not worth your precious gaming time   Just get   Commander KEEN   (for the retro lovers), or   Spelunky   (for the modern lovers) &amp; definately pass on this one.

That's right, EIGHT levels in I had to put my controller down and decide if the hours of idling would be worth it for the cards.   It's a shallow platformer that's not very worthy to begin with before you add in floaty controls, unnecessary enemy knockback, jumps that require perfect placement or a large portion of the level must be replayed (only up to LEVEL 8, remember), backtracking through said tedious jumps because the coins you're required to collect are on 2 different paths, constantly changing objectives (one level you're collecting coins, the next they're just a bonus while you're defusing bombs, the next is just grab all chests), a bad HUD (health 'bar' is a shrinking heart icon with no indicator of actual HP #'s and the timer is just a color-changing line), and pointless mechanics (losing your health just respawns you, why have timed levels, and the enemies are just roadblocks that respawn if jumped on).   When it gets down to it, Canyon Capers is just jumping, collecting different items in linear levels, and occasionally more jumping on 'baddies' that get in your way. That's it. If that's what you enjoy, fire up some NES classics and play something from the good old days that's still good. Not this.",

You are on a specific time each level, and you must collect part/everthing in the level. All the levels look the same, and the items you collect don't actually do anything. If you get touched you go flying backward, which is always such a stupid inclusion in platformers. The guy jumps terribly and awkwardly. It sucks having every level ruined because you missed 1 tiny item, or how you didn't plan your route perfectly, meaning its trial and error. Another problem is every level is linear, meaning if you want to get to the upper right and you're in the lower right, you have to get to the middle, then go right, then left, then right, and youll be there, because thats the single way to go there, which leads to backtracking. I jsut sick of retrying levels because this isn't a real platformer with progressing levels, objectives, or story. Just collect-a-thon where you need to 'collect all gems in 45 seconds or restart level until you can'. Busch League. 4/10.",

First of all, you just run and collect gems until something interesting to come, but, it doesn't come. You just keep completing levels that are similar and boring. If you like platformer games you should play Mario - not this.",

That when the character jumps he spins, albeit there are unlockable characters, I just couldn't be bothered.  Or could it be that the game is not about exploration just jumping around collecting gems in same same looking boxed environments.  I think its the fact that so much work has been put into this game, it seems really polished. It's polished like a tasteless aunties collection of porcelain girl and boy shelf figures. They'll never go on antiques roadshow, they're ugly and they're tacky, but your aunty with the blue hair and voice that grates on your ears love them.  I love Risk of Rain, a game, where you jump around limited environments, collecting stuff and unlocking characters. Sounds similar, it's just that, that game doesn't have a visual style I find nauseating.  I think I'll recommend this game, not because I like it, because we need different tastes, and we need that tacky aunty, with porcelain puppy dogs on her mirror shelves or whatever.  So if you like the visual style, what you'll get it a decent polished game. ",
