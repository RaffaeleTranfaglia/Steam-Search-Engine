    "description": "Prismatix is a fast-paced endless-runner where ones main objective is to beat the high-score. It is a small, yet solid and re-playable game, that you can play while waiting. Try not to fall down the Spectrum Lake, as you jump on the platforms, and shoot down the enemies. Will you manage to beat your high-score?",
