However as is the problem with all CYOA on this engine, the amount of stats and what they mean do not translate well into making decisions.   Worth it at 3$, get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "The story is fun, puts you into Greek mythology. My only complaint is that there are times when you feel like the game presents you with nothing more than the illusion of choice. Meaning the game appears to be offering you a genuine choice of several very different options yet whichever you choose the result will be the same with only lipservice paid to the actual choice you made. So...I'm unsure how many real 'change the plot' choices there are or if the plot is basically set in stone and you are just dictating the tone/dialogue/windowdressing.",

            "review_text": "I really enjoy a lot of the Choice of Games titles. I wasn't sure if this one would end up standing out or not from the demo, but it did. Then length is very good, so it's worth it's money at least in content. It doesn't tackle any particularly new ideas, but it's not trying to as much as set you in an ancient tale. This is fine, it does it well. You feel like you have quite a bit of agency, some of the twists are not easily predicted, I found no obvious bugs in mechanics or dialogue, the stats you built are meaningful and consistant, and the writing quality stays solid through to the end. It might not be a title I recomend to people who are new to text adventures or CoG brand in particular over some other riveting titles, but it is a really enjoyable game. The price is pretty reasonable for the content, but if you're not sure about it, picking it up during a sale is resonable. If you come to enjoy the genre, definitely check out their website for more of their games since they're not all on Steam. Every game has a free demo, and a handful are free all the way through.  TL;DR: Fun game if you're already a text/CoG fan, if not, pick it up on sale and give it a try anyway. I enjoyed it.",

The adventure is epic, the decisions really feel like they matter, there are so many ways to succeed and fail and the feelz! Great story, great writing, takes a little bit from homer's odyssey and other greek-like myths butt still feels fresh, well planned and very well thought out. Tin Star will be the next one I purchase and play after this one.",
