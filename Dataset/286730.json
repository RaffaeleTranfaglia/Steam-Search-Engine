Man I wish I still had my old Joystick so I could experience being 6 again...  The controls are not explained at all, but after about 10 minutes of pressing buttons everything came back to me. And as far as graphics go, I must say this game has aged well, it's not up to par with modern games at all but damn it still looks cool.  Also, as a side note I still have the disc for this game, it doesn't work with newer systems but hey! Still have it! Now I just need Comanche 4 again and I can die a happy man.  Probably not worth it if you're only interested in the latest and greatest, but a definite must-play if you like this kind of game. Also a definite must-re-buy if you played it in the past. GIVE IN TO YOUR NOSTALGIA, YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.",
