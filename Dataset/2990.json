Like if they always were there somewhere. FlatOut 2 might aswell be one of the first video games I've played on the PC. I don't even remember the year when I played it. Around 2007-2010 maybe? But mah lawd is it a good game for me. Maybe a couple years/12 months ago played the Ultimate Carnage with my friend. Too bad the multiplayer ain't working no more. Would've loved that.  The only downside I get from FO2 is the textures. Usually the textures don't really bother me but in FO2 the textures seem to blur the road so it's hard to see where you drive. Or it might just be the resolution, I dunno.  Overall. Oh my god is this a good game. And made by Finnish people too! Recommend 10/10",

Derby mode alone is enough to let off all the steam after hard working day. When you strike some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the side on 100 km/h... It's one of a kind feeling. Too bad GameSpy is f\\/cked.

Strength of the cars is much higher, so the driving becomes much faster because you don't need to worry about blowing your car up after a few hits. Actually you can really feel the speed. Hits are also much more satisfying because of the star awards for every hit. Driver characters in every race also makes it more personal - if someone pushes you out of track or something, you can hunt him down afterwards, because every driver is different. In first game everyone was practically the same. There is also much more derby events, speedway races and stadium challanges, though i didn't like the show cars with the jet engines.  Overall a fun game where even just driving feels enjoyable. Score - 8/10",

The physics are funny, the soundtrack is great (if you like semi-modern rock music), The damage engine is good, The graphics aren't too outdated, and best of all, the driving feels great, even on a mouse and keyboard. My one dislike is that the menus have no mouse navigation, which is the only thing that makes me realize that it's a PC port.  I highly reccomend this game to anyone, really.

I think I can play this game for a long time and have fun with it, 'cos every race has surprises. You need to run and try to defeat other racers, and need to avoid and keep safe with a lot of destruction instinct. Oh, the soundtrack is very good too, nice songs, rock'n roll all the time.

And those are not good post effects, but some cheap brownish-orange overblurred sepia, like in GRID. They took the first game, increased the speed and added explosions, basically, they made a BurnOut out of the good game. Honestly, I tried. I finished the first tier for all golds, and on the second tier I realized it's overly boring. The original FlatOut was way more catchy and it was unique at the time.

Controller would be nice to have, your mouse is obsolete for this game, you only need AWSD and/or arrow keys. Addicting, fun, and challenging! Worth the $9.00.

The controls are a bit sluggish but tight nonetheless. It's fun to just smash the ♥♥♥♥ into people in a race and then participate in a stunt course where you can pretend to be Paul Walker by crashing your car, flying out of it and smashing into somthing. The soundtrack consists or mainly rock and pop punk, with a touch of metal and a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ band we call Nickelback. But just because the game has a couple of songs by Pennyback, doesn't mean the soundtrack is bad, because you get songs by bands such as Rise Against, Fall Out Boy, Underoath, Megadeth, Yellowcard and Papa Roach.   Overall rating: 8/10 Recommended if you like: Racing games, especially ones like Destruction Derby, as it is a similar game.",

            "review_text": "Flatout 2, in my opinion, is one of the best arcade raceing games you can find and I'm not just saying that because of the nostalgia I have for playing it on Playstation2.  Pros: +Graphics: For a game that came out in 2006 on the Playstation 2, it looks amazing. I would even say it's Playstation 3 good.  +Gameplay: The controls are simple but fun and there's plenty of gamemodes to make the price well worth it, from career mode to single races, minigames to demolition. The tracks are filled with hundreds of collidable and destructable objects to smash through, windows, furniture, billboards, fences, barn walls, ECT. The minigames are one of the best parts of the game, how can you not love hurling your drivers ragdoll body into a dart board or row of bowling pins?  +Very little glitches: Ignore the hours Steam says that i have played because I've spend a good few dozen hours back on the PS2 and I hardly run into any glitches. Really the only ones I seem to find is the rare object floating or getting stuck in your car for a few seconds, nothing gamebreaking.  +Soundtrack: The choice of music in Flatout 2 is amazing and I would dare say comparable to the older Tony Hawk games. Some of the bands featured in the game are Bad Religion, Megadeth, Yellowcard, Fallout Boy and Nickleback.  Cons: - Controller support: Although you can use an Xbox 360 controller, it's only partially compadable, but to be honest I don't find it to be that big of a deal, just a bit annoying. You can't pause with the controller or navigate the menus, because controllers only work when racing.  -No online support: Don't get this game if you're looking for a racing game to play with friend online, because it's a a port of a Playstation 2 game.  -Sofia Martinez: ♥♥♥♥ that ♥♥♥♥♥! She's always right behind you and the smallest mistake can have her to pass you up.",

The race tracks are amazing with nice maps and lots of deaths...And the canal map (my favorite) is just perfect &lt;3. Sadly is not possible to play online like before, with gamespy shutdown the online multiplayer support is gone, you can use other ways to play flatout online like Tunngle, and you will find some players to play with.

It's not only racing, there are also special games modes, for example, you have to jump out of a fast moving car and try to go the highest. This makes the game more fun.  The physics in the game are OK, it feels realistic to drive the cars, and ramming your opponents look awesome! But, be careful when driving fast, because even the tiniest objects, like sticks and rocks, can just bring your car to a wheelie and then crash, allowing your opponents to pass you.  There are a variety of cars to choose from, within 3 categories; derby, race and street. The cars are upgradable which is cool, but you cannot customize your car. The soundtrack for this game is epic! There are amazing tracks featuring Alkaline Trio and Yellow card etc. I think you'll enjoy the music, and old, classic racing game soundtracks sound great.  You might not like this game if you just want to race, because in this game, you will need to crash other cars as well, to get nitrous.  I really enjoy this game! And it's at a cheap price, so even better! This game is so recommended for fans of Burnout, like myself, and other car-crash and other action games.",

I still remember the day when I found out that I couldn't play online anymore, it was a sad day. I had lots of friends that would get on around the same time I would. It still has multiplayer, but you need a third-party software to run it.   If I were you, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. I bought the Flatout complete pack for $6. It's worth it. Besides Flatout 3, that game is trash.  (Show Sally Taylor no mercy!)",
