            "review_text": "Extremely challenging and insanely fun! Solar Shifter is a shmup with immersive 3D backgrounds and massive battles. You can use your ship to shift out of tough situations, avoid deadly lasers and obstacles.  I enjoyed every minute of this little gem so far, and its only fault in my opinion is that the screen can get a bit cluttered sometimes due to the 3D background. This isn't that much of an issue, and the addictive nature of the gameplay will quickly get you hooked. The price is also more than generous.  I definitely recommend this game. ",
