            "review_text": "Though I'm familar enough with the DC Universe from a pop culture perspective, DCUO was an outstanding 'educational' experience, putting me in the middle of massive DC lore. I learned a lot about characters and locales that I've only ever given a passing glance. The graphics are pretty nice in a optimized sort of way. There is quite a bit of varability to your character, though extremely simplified from more traditional RPG's. The F2P aspect really doesn't hurt you too much until you've reached end game levels and are finding yourself bored. At this point, you either decide to move on to something else or start plunking down for DLC, which will include additional character options, maps/arenas and storylines. Unless you jump, head first, into the end game content, the community really doesn't do much with you. You can join a league, but from beginning to entry level raiding, you aren't really worth the time for anything helpful. The 1-30 run can be handled solo, with the occassional interaction with the community, so if you're there, just to see the sights, it's well worth the venture.   Pros: Lots of DC history. Easy to learn gameplay. Graphics work well from medium to higher end systems. Lots of DLC, if interested.  Cons: The community snubs it's nose at F2P'ers. You only have Gotham and Metropolis as open world content. The rest is instance play. You are relatively limited in character builds unless you purchase DLC. Little to no viable end game content for F2P'ers. Pony up $$ if you want to keep advancing.",

            "review_text": "As a regular player of the game, I will go Schrodinger and not recommend the game while recommending it.  1 - If you intend never to spend any money on this game, don't play it for more than once per week. Endgame is seriously limited after you hit max level, specially as you can progress very quickly on that point. Conversely, subscribers might enjoy the game a lot, unless they allow very little to bother them. 2 - Do not queue publicly after Tier 4. Teams are horrible and, to add to that, refuse to acknowledge their own fault. I don't even bother trying to tell them that (I don't like pointing fingers at others), I play as a Healer (Hi, world, it's Combat Doctor here!) and I just stand there keeping my team alive and trying to keep myself out of trouble. 3 - Keep your voice chat off. Your ears will be very thankful.  4 - Play with friends. 5 - Don't bother about power customization if you want to play a damage role or any role whatsoever. Thanks to Advanced Mechanics, pratically all power customization has been thrown down the toilet. You can make custom builds, but they won't be nearly as effective as the cookie cutters.  Potential 10/10, currently 5/10 from me.",

            "review_text": "So, DLC ehhr I mean DC Universe Online is a good game.The game revolves around brainiac invading earth, in the minst of battle with Lex Luthor Batman, Superman and Wonder Woman get killed and without any heroes to defend earth, it gets overrun.Lex Luthor goes back in time and warns the heroes previously mentioned about the danger the future holds, and releases an exobit which allows normal people to get powers. This is where you step in, creating your character hero/villain. Depending which mentor you choose will depend on your city of operations (Batman/Joker=Gotham, Superman/Lex Luthor=Metropolis and so on), the combat varies on melee and ranged attacks with a few unlockable combos and powers.  Pros: Interesting idea  Detailed worlds  tons of character customization options  Lots of comic book lore  fun combat  ok storyline  tons of collectibles  cons: Occasional server crashes and force closing  They didn't cut back on the dlc, but it is f2p after all  Final score: 8/10",

It has some cool character customzations, various enemies, decent fighting mechanic (as long you do not pick a brute as template)and i have to say not many games can switch from flying to walking so smoothly. One thing that bothered me is that It looked like something a 12 year old would play, yet their was Red Lantern Guy Gardner, known to be one of the most brutal and gory characters in DC universe(still not as bad as Lobo). I would recommend this game, but if your like me certain minor things might ruin your feel for the game. Eye-sore color scheme costumes like purple and yellow, green and pink, and much more... set you on edge, You might want to skip this. The game is well done for a free to play, an if you like DC universe get it, but again (I KNOW IT SOUNDS STUPID) the color choices by some of the players in that community made me stop, Because i'm an OCD little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and i cant help it.",

            "review_text": "First of all, I recommend a fast internet connection...not necessarily in order to play, but for the download. After downloading a few gigs on the initial download from Steam, it patched another 11 GB. So... if you do have a slow connection, this one will be one of those 'overnight downloads'  Anyway, what can I say about DCUO? I did start playing about 4 weeks after it was launched, and liked it very much early on. I eventually did stop playing, but came back several times. Unfortunately, due to the switch to and from P7S1-Games and an email-addy I cant access anymore, I lost my original account and another one I made.   It's not THAT much of a problem though, as leveling a char to the cap level does not take long at all. You do a few 'main story' quests plus some bonus side quests, and in no time, you are there. So, leveling is not as much a part of the game as in other MMOs, unless you wanna level a ton of alts. That is totally ok though, I like leveling, but don't need days of leveling in EVERY game I play.   The game itself is lots of fun, and since I mentioned alts: YOu should try a few, try different builds. The weapon sets (like gadgets, swords, guns, kinetics etc.) are tons of FUN. So is the controller-role IMO... most of the chars I made were controllers.   If you like to, you can build a new char based on your favorite DC char (I made a Batman-inspired gadget-using controller, and on my old account, I made a Flash- and a Green-Lantern inspired char. The latter was pretty easy regarding outfit and powers, as one of the DLCs will give you very nice Lantern-style powers). Or you can go for a totally unique character regarding powers and outfits  The game is fast, think 'MMO meets arcade beat em up'. The races and challenges are fun, and one thing I liked was that several of the quest bosses and special dungeons you do at cap level especially (and I am talking about solo-instances) are pretty challenging the first few times. It DID feel like a nice little achievement to finally beat some of these encounters, so that was nice.  The game never kept me playing longer than a few weeks, but also, I always keep coming back to it. It's fast, it can be quite tough, but it's tons of fun, whether you are a DC fan or not.",

You start by creating your character. Male or female, tall or small, wizard or ninja,... it doesn't matter, because there won't be a super hero like you! You will be unique!  Altrough the game, you will make your character become more powerful, you will make it have more powers (some of them are iconic powers, like the heat vision of superman; the Canary Cry of Black Canary; etc...)  There are many missions in the game, and each one of them reward you with different prizes as you complete them.  In conclusion, the game is fantastic, I will play it as long as possible! &lt;3  ",

When flying (If you choose that super power) and flying fast threw all the colours and buildings etc, you will notice you start to feel sick. I did all the time when flying, up down, up down, left right all well colours on your screen. Very disorientating. (How ever it is spelt)  2. Every mission has the same thing to do and outcome, go here beat this guy up and his hench men or pose... and report back. This becomes very very boring soon, and then when you max rank you just spend most of your time helping others with a mission because no more really unlock.  Then you hit the pay wall. The wall asking you to pay for ALL the DLC because you are extremely limited to your class and what to do, and then it goes all down hill from there.  You can max rank, you can do quiet a lot of stuff, but if you want to use green lantern or people like that. It is pay us money and that is a no no.  The game is worth the time you put into it. After all, free super hero but it is not worth the money I think, which I am glad I did not pay.  You are a super hero that can be killed by a basic mob... You never feel powerful or strong like a super hero is.   It has small other problems, like you get a small bag size, to buy a bigger it is real money, to do certain stats it is real money. Otherwise you spend lots of time getting small stuff and just doing the story and quests which I have no problem with :)",

But if u feel like going into this game u should probably look at the expanssion they have created and are creating at this moment, u will have new power avaible u will unlok the 3 set of pvp guear as new raids and all. Even if u play as a free member u will have so mutch to do that u will never feel bored. Is a magnific game and very creative 2. I sugest u use a controller because there are a lot of buttons to push and I think they are very well put in your controller and good luck =)",

Don't be a joker, check it out now! :)",

            "review_text": "A free to play MMO, DC Universe Online is a game that attempts to make MMO combat more exciting and involving, rather than just 'click and wait'; the combat plays out similarly to an action game, with many different weapon and power types, each with their own animations and unlockable combos. This helps keep the game feeling fresh through multiple character playthroughs, although the combat eventually becomes somewhat repetitive, and it doesn't help that most of the quests are 'Kill 30 enemies' or 'Destroy 10 things'; the formula rarely changes. Navigating the world is enjoyable due to the fun travel powers (which are unlocked from the beginning), although flying feels boring in comparison to super speed or athletics. Needless to say, DC fans are the ones who will get the most enjoyment out of this game, with many iconic locations to explore in the worlds of Metropolis and Gotham, and countless famous foes to square off against.  TL;DR: If you are a fan of MMO's and a fan of DC superheroes (or supervillains), you should definitely try this game.",

If you don't buy the DLCs you're pretty much stuck in the same missions over and over again.  I never bought a DLC or anything in this game, never spent a dime on DCUO but I am considering spending just a bit from time to time to get access to my escrow cash.  Even with all this cons (P2W and many many DLCs) I still enjoy the game and will keep on playing it on my free time. As a free player you still can do a lot and overall I think the F2P part of the game is very very good, just don't expect to be the no. 1 player without spending some money.",

The game like many mmo's has you make your own charcater, chose a power, etc. The game has nice unique features to make you stand out if you chose. You can chose a superhero mentor, Superman, Batman, or Wonderwoman, who each specify in one unique kind of fighting style. For vilians mentors include, Lex Luthor, The Joker, and Circe. I finished my game as a superhero under the help of Batman. I found myself traviling from Metropilis to Gothem completing missions. Throught 2/3's of the game it is tedious and gets increasingly more difficult. Although ranking up and getting more powers, the game has a very short stop. I probably put a couple of hours, either with my friends assitance or not. Like many mmo's once again, you can of course pay dlc to unlock more missions and or superpowers for your charcter to master! I leval cap'd in this game way to easily. If you wish to stay with your free account, like I did, you can make two charcters! Seems better than only one, until you realize, the storyline is the same, with or without friends or groups, you just switch your roles going through the same jobs! Overall this game only recives a 6/10 for its shortness and paywalls. I'd recommend this if your looking for a nice short game on your computer or Sony Console.

If you're a working man who only has a couple of hours each day, it'll take you a week. With a party it's a lot faster. You have to join a league or else you'll get nowhere in this game. Please don't PUG too much. Plan instances with your league. You'll get ♥♥♥♥ done much faster that way. You have to get membership after level 30 because you won't be able to progress without it as you lack all the DLC's. And last thing, if you only have two hours a day to play this game, then this game is not for you. I'm saying that because you wouldn't be getting the full experience, only a sample.

I say this because after you hit level 30, you hit subscription-based paywall. With that said, though, the features players pay for are totally worth it in that you get hours upon hours upon hours of fun (I have over 1000 hours in the game...).   Pros About the Game: - Unique MMORPG (superheroes man, how much better can it get?) - Insane customization - Decent character creation - Game community and Daybreak (game company) communicate well and creators listen to players. - Monthly DLC is gone and now replaced with larger DLC packs being released every few months.  Cons About the Game: - 'Free to Play' is almost false considering the pay-to-win structure of the game (ie: Utility Belt) - Missions are fun, but get pretty boring - Not really much replay value with regards to low level operations   All in all, I really enjoy this game; I wouldn't have played over a thousand hours of it if I didn't. That said, the game is really meant to be for those who are ready to pay for DLC or subscribe to a membership. If you can't afford to do so, for whatever reason, you may want to re-consider hopping into this game. If you can afford it however, then I highly recommend you give the game a try; I mean it’s free until level 30 anyways so there’s nothing to loose and everything to gain!",

Still it does have some obvious flaws, including that it's undeniably pay-to-win. However as someone who believes in a 'Give Nothing Get Nothing' Policy I have no problems with a microtransaction or two - if it makes the game more enjoyable.  Still I recommend you try it inspite of it's pay-to-win hierarchy because it is quite fun; I haven't reached level 30 yet (character level cap) but I have gotten into some PvP Fights and a couple of dungeons and they were quite fun (naturally I lost the PvP Arenas because of my gear :/ - Still Got Marks tho :D ) The game is more heavily populated by PSN Players now adays which is obvious because of the PSN tag they get from connecting through the PS3/PS4. I use my PS3 Controller with a small windows mod to convert it into a XBOX-style input (the mod does not directly mess with any of the game files - only my my Operating System) and it gives me no tag :/  The Downloads of the initial game are something of a chore - even with my blazing fast, rock solid internet it takes me like half an hour to download this game in full. Once it's fully downloaded though everything should be ok as long as you don't uninstall it.",

            "review_text": "Its one of my favourite all time games and favourite MMO of all time. The superhero storyline and theme is very appealing to my personal preference and the combat hack &amp; slash system is amazing for an MMO. Its simply, yet can be sophisticated too. If you learn all the powers and fighting combos, you can put together your online fighting style and combat technique to destroy all opposing forces. A lot of people slam the game for all types of reasons but people need to understand, no game is perfect and not every aspect of the game will appeal to you. This is one of very very few games, where 99% of everything in the game, appeals to me and makes me want to delve into the game 24/7.   The only downfalls to the game IMHO, is the leveling cap. Level 30 is very low in my opinion and since I have played since launch, I would have hoped that it would have been increased to level 50 at least by now. Thus adding much more content and storyline to the game. The DLCs are ok and some of it was just what I was hoping for, but are money grabbing DLCs in other peoples opinions. But when you love this game as much as I do, I dont mind it at all and will support developers till the end of this games life. Ive already maxed out and done everything possible in DCUO on the PSN network and have recently migrated over to the PC version to start again. It shows just how much I love this game and am willing to put in hundreds of dollars again into the game to support developers. The powers in the games could be further externded if possible and more tactical battles amongst PvE and PvP would be great too. Im hoping the game will be expanded over time and more content will be added to bring back veteran players and bring in more new players as well. For that to happen, the F2P system needs to be looked at again as most people have deemed the game as a P2W game. It is somewhat but minimal. Yet its still enough to throw people off the game and slowly kill the community.   I would love to work aside the SOE developers to offer suggestions, test new content and help expand the DCUO game overall. From day one, I have had hopes that it would be expanded and content added on a regular basis to rival games like WOW. To me it has the potential and should have treaded carefully in doing so. But now its too late for that, but it still has time to make a 360 degrees turn around and still become one of the best MMOs out there. The metacritic score of 72/100 is very low in my opinion and should have scored much closer to 80 and even 85-90. But I believe that the level 30 cap and slow and small amount of content added over the years, had hindered its progress and made the community much smaller than it should have been. If good content and level cap raised happened earlier on, the game would would have been much more known and better ranked. Its direct rival, Marvel, has a much higher metacritic review score and it is a good game, but I still believe what DCUO offers is still is just as good, if not better.  I have had ideas in my mind about DCUO and what could be added to the game to make it much better and bring back its player base and even bring in more players. I have emailed the SOE about it and gotten no reply and believe its fallen on deaf ears and/or the team has given up on DCUO or but it on thr back burner, because they believe the potential the game had, is long gone. When it first became F2P, it pulled in 100K new accounts. SOE should have used that opportunity to build upon the amazing the game they already had and add content accordingly so the new players could see how amazing DCUO really is and what theyve been missing out on. But sadly, I believe it was all done as a ploy to grab as much money as they can to base future DLC projects upon the amount of players and funds coming into their account. Thats where I think SOE went most wrong. Instead of listening to the player base and adpting to the F2P system they implemented, they went on how much money they could make and didnt take the communities opinions and suggestions seriously or at all in most cases.    To finish up on my review for now, I still think DCUO is an amazing game and definitely recommend to everyone that loves MMOs, hack &amp; slash type of games, RPGs, DC Universe and a mostly friendly  community base. The game has some flaws and drawbacks but no game is perfect. But IMHO, this game comes closest to being a perfect game in my eyes. The majority of its content is very appealing to my personal preferences and keeps me very intrigued and wanting to constantly play every free moment I get. I have a ton of suggestions, ideas and concepts that could/would make the game amazing and hugely expansive without much work necessary, but whether someone from SOE reaches out or even cares enough about its own game, to do so, I will only have to wait and see. I have contacted them twice already in recent times, with no reply or acknowledgment at all that they have received my email, so I assuming their response team is either lacking in personnel or just cant be bothered. I hope DCUO will continue to expand and SOE looks to add an expansion pack as rumors were swirling when DCUO was at its peak, but since then, there has been nothing but mediocre DLC packs. Good or poor as they may be, we need more! I would love for an expansion that would raise level cap and introduce a new main storyline to DCUO. It would be amazing to see and I could gurantee, it will bring back alot of veterans and even bring in new players to the game as they see the development team are still working on the game and actively adding more and better content. As it is right now, the latest content added, are very small and lazy-like. Not much hype or even amazment about them. Seems like a small team is only left to deal with DCUO and it is very saddening in my eyes and heart. I had wished and still do, for DCUO to be around for at least another 5 years with active excellent content being added. All the possible storylines are already there in the DC Comics and just needs to be integrated into DCUO. I dont see how hard that can be and how much amazment it would bring to true DC fans and DCUO fans.   Ill give SOE a free idea/suggestion on a possible future expansion to further DCUO and its content and gameplay. Take the DCUO universe to the universe....literally....Brainiac came to us...lets now take the battle to him and his home. Giving the opportuinty to even explore the Green Lanterns galaxy, the remains of the planet Krypton....there is so much more that can be added and expanded from that alone. Enough to create an expansion that would be mind blowing and amaze the die DC fans and DCUO fans. If this were somehow to materialize, I would further support DCUO and SOE and make sure to do my part in helping spreading the word about the expansion. And if given the opportuniy, even help out with testing, suggestions or anything I can be of help with if SOE were to approach and ask me to help. I would be a great ambassador for DCUO. My love for the game, knows no bounds and I just wish for its success to be limitless and never ending. Please SOE, heed my word and suggestions, and do whats best for us DCUO fans. I will forever be grateful and dont want to see DCUO end up a dead community where I am running around with a few people trying the game and leaving not long after because of the dead player base. Its already saddening to see the same players over and over and no new people or veterans. But Im sure an expansion and marketing and awarness project would bring DCUO back to life again to the peaks of MMO history and amazement that its destined to be. It should be rivaling WOW. WOW has no real rival and I thought DCUO had that potential with its already rich history of lore and stories that are already out there. How amazing would it be to play it with your own created hero ?!?!    9.7/10 - Almost Perfect",

            "review_text": "This game is all kinds of fun. Running around flash style, zipping around buildings batman style, or just superman-ing it up, running around with a unique hero with your own special powers and weapon choices is a total blast. I have quite a lot of hours put into this outside of steam mind you. This is the only game I've ever played that pulled off the ability to FEEL like a super hero/villan.   I could do a pro/con list, but I'm sure you would have seen plenty of them by now, so I'll just give my basic opinion of the game itsself. There is quite a few powers you can choose from, on top of several weapons you can choose from to go with any kind of play style you really want. No one weapon or power is neccesarrily better than the other either, you just have to play accordingly. Which isn't a bad thing, but some people don't get that and assume there is...shall we say 'cookie cutter' builds. I'm sure there is certain ways that you can play a specific build to make it better, but it is by no means REQUIRED in any sense. At least in my experience playing with tons of people (raids and pvp).  As far as the F2P (free to play) model, let's all be honest, it could be a whole lot worse. Given it's current F2P model, I think it's fair enough. But ABSOLUTLY DO NOT expect to get the whole game through the F2P model. I heavily recommend just doing the subscription, as it will save you hundreds of dollars up front. Many powers among other things will be LOCKED unless you have the dlc, which all gets UNLOCKED when you get the sub. $15 a month is much more manageable for most people anyways. But again, that's just my preference on the matter. You will not be able to access most end game raids through the F2P model, or most 'auction house' stuff (due to the cash cap).  Overall I give this game a 8/10 for ingenuity and enjoyability. It's definitly a gem amongst the many crappy MMO's that are out there, especially the ones following a 'F2P' model. At least download it and try it, the worst that could happen is you just not like it and uninstall it anyways. Which I personally doubt if you are even looking at this game and curious if it's enjoyable or not.",

For this reason alone this ranks high on my list of very replayable MMOs as I always come back to this game when I just want to be a super hero and fly around as I consider it the current gold stadard for super hero MMOs. Personally I am not an avid MMO player so I don't like that sometimes when grinding out kills for a quest combat encounters feel very cookie cutter because you are fighting one type of mob so I wouldn't give this a 10/10 as it, like the whole MMO genre, has some work to do but I highly recommend it as the graphics are superb, ui doesn't feel clunky, it is very openworld, and gameplay is fluid. Definately a must play. The time steam says I've spent on this game is less than I've spent on it because I've played since it was released free to play and only recently did I play it from steam.",

As you play from level 1 to level 30 it's all fun and games, with various side missions along the way. after level 30 it gets a little less fun. To continue on in the game you have to purchase the DLC, and to really level up in the game you have to keep spending money. Another issue with this game is the constant crashing and technical issues that arise while playing. It can be as severe as completely crashing your computer to bad lag or screen freezes. The game also has quite a few glitches, such as the map not loading fast enough and causing your character to fall through the map.

Recommended to make your superhero with an armor that you don't mind being changed. You can be a hero or villain, doesn't affect gameplay as much, just when you are a hero, you go to police stations, and when you are a villain, you go to clubs. After you pick your side, you pick from three mentors. This just determines your starting area. For example, if you pick batman, you start in gotham, same w/ joker for villains. superman=metropolis, etc. Then you pick from a pretty good variety of powers, including Ice, my personal favorite, fire, telekinesis, even nature. After that you pick a weapon and movement method. you can pick acrobatics, which is jumping and climbing, flying, the definite fastest, and superspeed, turning you into flash. for weapons, you can have a bow, dual pistols, an assault rifle, and some melee weapons, including a dlc shield. (damnit dlc!) Also note that your powers, movement method, and weapons are all skill trees you can level up for new attacks based on the skill tree. for example, flying lets you do wind or cyclone attacks, pistols let you learn gun-kata, (like this if you remember that), or pistol kungfu, which actually looks pretty badass when strung together.

In addition, they're still updating the game, including more powers to play with. What really makes this game fun is the active combat. You pull off combos and use melee and ranged attacks in real time. Dodge rolls and blocking is thrown in to make this a great and very enjoyable combat system for an MMO. Different movement styles like super speed, acrobatics, and flying. Different fighting styles like staffs, swords, hand guns, rifles, bows, and hand-to-hand combat. You can really make a Hero or Villian you've dreamed of and fight along with other iconic characters of the DC universe. All the heros and villians are fully voiced and Mark Hamill as the Joker? C'mon, that's just the cherry on top. However the lvl cap is 30 but you continue getting better gear rto increase your combat rating to take on harder missions and get sweet, better loot. I mostly played solo but still found fun in the solo missions and the 4 player alerts(dungeons). Watching a DC movie new in theaters or a new DC cartoon just gets me in the mood to sign back up to play as my shield weilding, gadget using, buff specialist, supervillian cyborg.",

The gameplay is sublime and incredibly fluent, i experienced no lag. Graphics wise, the game stood up to the cartoony, yet serious style that DC comics have always used. Storywise the game gave me joy whilst playing, however as i would normally get side tracked by side missions in other games, this game i was 100% on story and only actually played a couple side missions. Another problem that i faced was the stats of some weapons and armours, i ended up bying a very powerful gun at the start of the game for a very cheap price and used it up to the point where i was at level 27, due to no other guns matching or overthrowing any of its stats. however (and i would not say borderlands extreme) but the game offered a wide range of equipment and armour, attention to small details as most of the armour was not just different stat wise but also looked different to armour of the same subgroup. Overall this game was a great success in my mind, however my one major problem with it was, it is 'pay to win'. through the campaign i was bombarded with dlc requests and had to get rid of items because i simply did not have the correct dlc. Very off putting if i were a minor playing this game, i would preffer that you aquir certain items from dlc and not be asked about them mid-game. Aside from that, this is a great game to pick up and i would definitely recommend this game to anybody. - 9/10.",

The latest Catwomen content seemed like someone just churned up and thrown in with the bug release as the level itself was very easy. The other problem is how the mobs don't tend to adapt to your level. For example in many other MMOS you'll face a mob when you're level 10 and then when you're, for example, level 30 ,and you encounter that mob again he'll still be just as hard. The game is quite expensive when paying over the months but it's quite fun when playing with friends. And the community seems to be stable/growing.

You get to make the hero you want with few limitations. Gameplay is action oriented. No auto attack or click and hold to attack. Moves revolve around skills and combos. The game is fully explorable. Almost open world (with the exceptions of changing cities, going in buildings, and doing dungeons). You can have a hideout, but that seems to be more for those willing to spend money (furnishings, better locations). I never talked much, but, from what I could tell (back when I still played) the community was very active. Questing: It does have your filler quests to lengthen the game and provide quest gear, but the story quests are fun, and bosses can be difficult (because why have a game if it is too easy?).  Cons: As an MMO, I expect this, but it still bugs me: Gear is a thing. I can't say for pvp, but gear can make or break a character. Gotta gear up. I get bored of Warcraft because of two things: Not action based, and engame is a gear grind. Questing: When a city gets attacked, you expect just that area to be under attack. Here, everywhere is being attacked all the time (quest zones). I understand the reasoning behind this, but it would be nice to see the area at peace when you and your comrads save the day. Warcraft uses phasing to do this. Great mechanic. Very immersive. The programmers here probably can't use their system for that. Maybe they don't know how. Maybe they don't want to. Whatever the case, it is a con in my book. The faction headquarters can be confusing for new players. If I remember, I wandered around a while before finally getting oriented...  Honestly, I reccommend this game to anyone who doesn't mind (or enjoy's) gear grinding, and to those who feel a city in constant chaos is the perfect way to relieve stress. Personally, I couldn't get past it, but I still enjoyed the game while I did play.",

You can't play as a main character such as Superman, Batman, The Flash etc. you have to design your own character and you are limited to certain resources and if you want to resemble Batman, the Flash, Superman you have to just make a design that is close enough to it. Also it shows alot of green lantern stuff along with other lanters, but what they don't say is that you have to buy that stuff. Also you can sometimes make characters like superman by unlocking his embelem but in order to unlock it you need to complete a bunch of challenges and challenges that are hard. its like you need hacks to complete stuff like that. But I am not telling you to hack, I am just saying that this game can be decieving by its looks, However this game is really fun and I would recomend it but I cant choose a nuetral option so I will choose Yes.",

Being able to choose good or bad side have always been fun for me with games, I always choose the evil side. It goes against the normal 'Hero is born and has to save everyone!' which most games use. I love the Joker and how psychotic he is, so having him as my mentor was the greatest. I highly suggest playing this if you enjoy MMOs and being able to be a little evil or good if you like to stick to the norm. You will have a blast picking the mentors, powers, looks and other abilities in this game.",

Like most MMORGP's has the auto-aim / auto-target. This is not very new, but also not very innovative. The top level (30) is easy to reach and there is plenty of end-game content. For the end game you need a good, active and cooperative community. That is sadly the biggest problem of the game.  The comminution on the PS3 unfortunately is very newbie unfriendly (PC unknown, but see forums.) You will not get much help, even if your level gets higher you can get regularly kicked from groups if you do not perform. For large raids it is also difficult to find a (good) team.  I play the game the PS3, since I saw it there first and downloaded it. Also my characters there have the highest level, I have it on PC, however in my opinion, a game controller required for the best get game experience.  Still, I would recommend this game, though it has its shortcomings. It is generally a fun and immersive gaming experience.  8/10",

Then yes this is the Perfect Game for you - Under that Notion this game would be a 10 out of a Friggin' 10.  However, let's put some real stats out there. !-Review as of Fri, October the 31st; Halloween-!  Cons- - Playing, having a blast, new to the game? Get Killed. It'll happen a lot. And I mean.. A lot, sometimes you cannot even complete missions/quests just because there's so many people out there to get you... It's not that bad though sometimes people just ignore. - Played 7 days straight? Great, you're not even close yet. The game requires a lot of time spent to get 'Up there' With all the 'Big boys'. Afterall the contents been there for quite some time... 3 Years of Contents to be precise. - Want XYZ powers with XYZ? Sorry you can't combine powers like that Unfortunately.  Pros- + Trailers leaving you breathless, wanting more. Story driven so good, you wanna read more story and start buying thousand dollar Comic books. Mentions of the story, as well as understanding why the story the way it is... Is amazingly put together, a game I cannot forget, but I have to put away (Due to time restrictions). If given the time, I'd throw my life into this... Until something 'Newer and slightly better' Presents itself a year or two from now. +Achievements grants bonuses (Stats) which is amazing, because now you'd have a reason to obtain them, and another way to obtain more... (In an evil laugh) MUWAHHAHAH~! POWERR~!! + Game customization is great, 8.5/10, I'd give this a 9, a 9.5, and a 10, if 1 of the three happens.  1) Allow mixing of powers, or a mixture of powers, or a combination of - There-of. 2) The ability to have multiple powersets rather than multiple characters.  3) Delve into territorial control (Such as districts) as well as mini-hq (From taking said districts, as a refill/access to mail, a hub). and 4) A greater purpose to 'Guilds/Clans/Group' so that, even if you are brand brand spanking new and only played 7 days straight... You'd still have a purpose to the 'Higher ups' as well as have something to do 'In the end of the game' whilst being only 7 days old.  + Replayability is always there, there's always an achievement you didn't get, or a mission you didn't thoroughly do.. Or people to hunt and kill and show prowess too. + The common game raids are there, and the bosses are quite challenging 'Some', lot's of DLC to get to continue gaming/expanding your repitore. + Too many more Pro's to list, why are you still reading this? Go get the game already~!",

After that there's no use playing since you need a membership in order to gain access to the weapons and armor needed to play with factions and enjoy the true essence of the game. You only get 2 hero slots to start, but if you spend $5 bucks you get 5 or 6 hero slots and a couple other perks. There are plenty of missions available and you get to fight some pretty cool bosses from the DC universe. That is probably the coolest part of the F2P mechanic. It's free. You have nothing to lose except hard drive space. You'll have fun playing it for a while, maybe until you hit level 30...then it's time to retire.",

Throughout the game you create your own character in extreme detail and completely to your own liking. You can play with friends, random people, and/or a league. One thing you must realize before playing this is level 1-30 is basically a long turtorial, hence why it can be completed in a day by experienced players.   The true leveling system in this game is called Combat Rating (CR). Assentially, once you reach level 30 you need to complete instances (solos, duos, alerts, and raids) to get more gear. However, as there are different tiers of gear there are also different tiers of instances. Which instances you are allowed to partake in is decided by your Overall Combat Rating. Their are three different combat ratings which are displayed in stats. Your Overall Combat Rating is the CR of all the gear you possess in your inventory. Your Equipped Combat Rating is the CR of the items you have currently equipped. And finally your PvP Combat Rating is the CR of all the PvP gear you have obtained.   Pros:  -Completely design and create your own character with the style tab that allows you to use any styles you have previously obtained with any gear you have equipped.  -Tons of powers, movement styles, stances, and more to pick from. -The DLCs really do add to the game with almost every one giving new powers, cities, alerts, raids, duos, housing systems, and more. -The Free to Play system is not half bad like in many other MMOs (SWTOR...) -The Legendary Status (subscription) is extremely worth the 15 dollars. Trust me, once you dedicate time to the game at level 30, you need everything it includes which is far more pricey to buy alone. -By the time you are doing instances at lvl 30 you will understand how to properly use your class due to leveling from 1 to 30. -A great community that often helps out when you ask. -A great trading system. -A rediculous amount of styles to wear (1000+). -Amazing PvP (and PvE for that matter).  Cons: -To be honest level 1-30 can be tedius after the first couple times once you do all the story lines. -As with all MMOs free to play service has its restrictions (such as credit cap). -At time the devs go overboard with the ban hammer (just be careful with how you act). -If you don't have a couple of friends to back you up in instances, it can be hard at early levels because people do tend to kick you if you are not performing well. -As with most MMOs, if you want to get anywhere, it becomes extremely time consuming. -Can't really think of much else...",

Also, I looked forward to playing a highly cooperative game with my friend. Otherwise, I would not even thought about it. I have since cancelled my subscription and plan on deleting the game once my month is up. I consider WoW the creme de la creme of MMOs. Still. Even after all the challenger MMOs that have tried to one-up it. Obviously, since I plan on deleting the game, my experience wasn't ideal. Mainly, I was just bored.   I prefer to play DC Universe over WoW. DCU is well-paced and immersive. The combat is above average for MMOs and it seems to take skill to get good at your 'power-type' (ice/fire etc). The combat involves combo attacks which made fighting a lot more interesting to me.   You still get your typical 'Kill X amount of X/Collect X amount of X' just like any other MMO but the game disguises it well in my experience and it doesn't get repetitive as fast as it does in other MMOs. I have played one dungeon as of yet and it also seemed less repetitive then your typical MMO. The dungeon still had a linear basis but unlike WoW you run (I fly) around a certain area and kill things rather then literally folow a linear path which I thought was a nice touch.  By far the one of the best things about DCU is the character creation. The creators of this game did not hold back as far as aesthetic possibilities for your hero or villain go. I consider myself a creative person and I had a blast making my hero. (A gadget-wielding, flying zombie with a gas mask, tech wings, gangster hood and jacket, tech legs and boots with high socks who happens to answers to Batman.) So yes, I then had the priveledge of running around Gotham as this ...'thing' (my character) whom I have grown to adore for his ridiculousness.   Highly reccomend for any MMO triers out there.    Note: Have not looked at all at paid DLC and I have not gotten to a curve in the game where I feel like I have needed to pay to be as good as other players who have. (I am lvl 11 or so and from my first impression the level cap seems to be 30. Correct me if I'm wrong.)",

            "review_text": "I’ll start by saying that I started playing this game since it launch and it wasn't on Steam, so the amount of hours I've put into it is sadly more than you can see. Also I am an Legendary/All Access member, so I have no restrictions in this game that you as a F2P player might encounter. I leveled a F2P character to the maximum achievable point, and I can tell that the only restriction that you will feel is the character slot limit (if you want to try all mentors and powers) and 1500 cash limit (you are allowed to carry only this amount with yourself, if you go over 1500 it will just go to the escrow and you won't be able to access it, only by paying). You can invest 5$ and some of the restrictions will get lighter, but the maximum amount of cash will be 2000, and believe me, you won't really feel it.  I once wrote loving review for this game, it was in 2012. Time is moving forward and yet the game does not. There was once a great amount of charm around this game, the road from 1 to max level was fast and colorful, and it was all based on quests. Yes, quests, filled with brilliant voice work and actually building up to the idea that Justice League will accept you as their member. Although there was a part of me that didn't really like this idea of levelling like a sidekick (after City of Heroes and Champions Online), but I was intrigued by the idea of what will open when you actually become a member. And then, after reaching max level, the problems started.   Let’s talk about the endgame structure. After reaching level 30 you get introduced to a new vertical levelling system – Combat Rating(CR). All the endgame content is divided into Tiers, and each tier requires a certain amount of CR. Each tier consists of a few Challenges (Solo missions), Duos (2-man content), Alerts (4-man content) and Raids (8-man content). From each of this activities you get random loot drops (once a day) and a certain amount of currency that you can use to buy better gear. The better the gear -&gt; the higher the CR -&gt; the higher the tier that is available to you.  So, let us continue. With introduction of new Raids and Alerts, the story still treated you like a sidekick. But that isn't really a problem. The problem was, that there wasn't an actual story behind any new content. Yes there are few Investigations/Briefings(game's variant of Data Logs), a few cutscenes and an 'epic premise' behind the scenes, which you don't have an ability to enjoy. In all the modes you get a little glimpse at something epic. And that's it. They did try to implement daily story missions in some DLC's but the last fun ones were in 'Home Turf', since then it was only getting more boring.  Now remember that to get further in that little story, you need to have an appropriate CR. But until reaching the needed CR to open a new tier of content and some development on the story, you're just replaying the same few alerts over and over, grinding as if you're in an Asian MMO (which are changing to the best lately). Without any variation. Until you reach a new tier you are just replaying the same few activities. And the sad part is, that they reuse the same content in every new DLC, you will see instances that were there even from the launch of the game. And every new zone that they actually create in the latest DLCs are suffering from a copy paste syndrome, where the starting zone is something new, but when you walk a few meters all you get is catacombs with one repeating section. I've heard an argument that maybe they do this so that PS3 will run it without problems, but come on, Defiance on X360 has more variety.  And that is the main point, comics are all about the story and characters, so was this game (from 1-30 levels). But in the end the focus shifted and instead of creating and implementing new campaigns, they create a few grind arenas. And after you reach that maximum CR there is nothing to do, except maybe feats that grant you some Skill Points, but you will need to replay the same content that you will probably hate.  One thing that you can actually praise the development team for is balancing and patching. Although this praise can be nullified, because when you see their live stream where, after this many years, they are proud that some Bosses are no longer turning instantly, but they do take their time, it is just preposterous. But they do balance the powers towards each other, although instead of creating different instances of your power in PVE and PVP, they meshed it up and occasionally PVP players will cry about something, which will lead to PVE nerf for that power and brake someone’s style of playing.  All in all, I do hope, that they will get back to their roots of creating stories and original content. Now that SOE has become somewhat independent, it can lead to great things or turning the money into a complete cash-grabber.  If you are interested in this game, don’t invest money. Just play the game from 1 to 30, after that there is absolutely nothing, that is worth your time. Although, if you really like DC Comics, grinding, praying to RNG and story isn’t that important for you then go for it ^_^. If for you story is a must and you want to feel involved in DC Universe, then just go from 1 to 30 and forget about this game. Your time and money can be spent better. To everyone else, who don't look for Superhero MMO and DC Comics, I cannot recommend this game. ",

This is an MMO-ARPG for PC and Console simultaneously - Adjust your expectations about gameplay and community accordingly  Decent graphics - Should run on any 2016 Windows gaming PC (uses Unreal3 engine) - Lacks modern polish (no advanced shaders) - Still looks good due to comic book visual theme (no photorealis tic texturing)  Some AAA Polish - Extensive opening movie - Cinematic cut-scenes  - Lots of voice-over during low levels  Captures the superhero ethos well - You can create your own superhero, extensive costumes and powers - Communicates the DC superhero 'world' well - Appropriate tongue-in-cheek scripts - Multiple level-up paths to 30, with slightly different voice-overs, missions, etc.  A dev team still exists - game originally built by SOE and sold to Daybreak Studios in early 2015 -- some people from SOE moved to Daybreak - game design fixes/adjustments have been made over the years - releasing new episodic content -- Must subscribe or pay to get this content (see F2P limits below)  UI is badly explained - tutorial is inadequate: too much glitz, not enough teaching - no manual - web and wikis often outdated (multiple game system changes since 2011 launch) - Current players often have difficulty explaining detailed game mechanics -- Players are a poor substitute for an up-to-date manual or wiki  Learning curve is gradual until you start doing group content - Post-level-30 teams and guilds (leagues) can be harsh, be prepared for ugliness - See community and teams below for details  'Mouselook' control method familiar to FPS players - but viewpoint is 3rd person - you see your character - moving around in open world, especially flying, can be awesome - movement controls have clunky design decisions for strafe and backward movement -- work-arounds exist, but they're clunky; somebody should shoot the designers (oh, yeah, they did)  Combos are major part of combat - mouse button 'tap' and 'hold' mean different things -- for example, combo could be left-tap, right-hold, right-hold -- variable internet lag can wreck combos - you need a stable connection to play - can learn multiple weapon types, each weapon has separate combo specials  Main game begins AFTER you reach level 30 - a lot post-level-30 content is 2-, 4- or 8-person missions, although some solo does exist - high level content often has gear requirements, you must 'qualify' for advanced missions  Community 'quality' is mixed - PUGs will kick people mid-mission to improve their own rewards at the end - Guilds ('leagues') are often elitist, requiring significant post-level-30 gear just to join - Console players alongside PC players = poor communication, culture clash  Team missions REQUIRE teamwork:  - Tank, healer, controller, damage are designed-in team roles (character classes) - Must know what is expected of your role, and play that role on a team - Be prepared for bad experiences in PUGs (pick-up groups)  Remaining player base is small - PC and playstation players on two servers (NA and EU) -- Xbox players combined into one server for NA and EU  If you spend money, even just once, the game has built-in voice support - Most leagues and teams expect mic and voice  No open world PvP - server mergers have removed all open world PvP servers - gankers who loved open world PvP also gone  F2P has significant limitations - DO get plenty of gameplay to judge the game -- No need to decide in two hour refund window -- You get a variety of superheroes who can level up to 30 -- Vast array of superhero clothing available for free, colors also free - NO need to constantly buy consumables or playing time - Do NOT expect access to the whole game for free -- You must pay to access the full range of possible superhero types (powers) -- You must pay to access most post-level-30 content -- Money accumulation limit 'escrows' excess income until you subscribe - Access to entire game requires either a $15/mon subscription or large one-time purchase -- one-time purchase costs about $190 to almost equal a sub -- Even the $190 purchase still results in certain limits, publisher WANTS you to subscribe",

I would recommend Champions online instead.  I first played DCUO way back at launch on ps3 and while it wasn't the best mmo ever and definitely wasn't as good as city of heroes. I still thoroughly enjoyed it. Back then I would have recommended it. Now however I definitely will not recommend it. First of all I couldn't even get it to install properly. The launcher would just randomly shut down without any warning while installing. I basically had to keep opening it, it would complete about 5% of the install and shut again but I kept going out of sheer nostalgia for this game.  Eventually I got the game installed and created a character it was only then the real troubles started. The game makes all free to play users wait in a queue to join the server. The estimated wait time was 2 and a half minutes however it took 10 minutes to get it only to be instantly booted back to character select. Another 10 minute wait and I was back in the prologue only to find that the controls were absolutely atrocious. My character wouldnt turn properly, instead he'd just kind of run forward and gradually turn round while still playing the forward run animation. Sort of like the tank controls from the old resident evil games. I don't know if its a bug but I certainly don't remember movement being that clunky back on ps3.  To make matters worse if you didnt move the camera while moving the character it would just flail wildy in random directions. Again I don't know if this is a bug or if they just messed up the controls when they ported it to pc. I tried searching online and found only one thread on steam of someone having this problem and absolutely zero solutions.   The flying controls seemed a lot more responsive so I tried to push forward only to have the camera completely disconnect from my character while i was flying. I made sure the auto follow setting was on but it didn't seem to help. It honestly felt like I was playing an alpha version of the game.   If you are a fan of DC then go ahead and try it. Maybe your experience will be a lot less buggy than mine but be smart and don't spend any money on this until you're sure it will work properly for you.",

Before you start raiding, it's fine, you can do any solo or group content without too much hassle. You can get away with no tank or no controller (restores group's energy).   But once you hit 30 and start raiding, this issue becomes unignorable. If your controller can't, or won't (looking at you, PUG raid controllers), restore energy, your group will wipe unless you're being carried. If your tank misses agro on 1 mob, your healer will die.  The healer relies too much on the controller, who both equally rely on the tank, who relies on DPS to kill ♥♥♥♥. It sounds basic, but it's like 10x the reliance on party composition in PvE content than any other game I've ever played.   As a healer, I can only cast 3 single-target heals before I'm completely drained of energy. This game has no passive energy regeneration, so I have to attack to regain energy. But attacking gives me less than 1% of my energy. Imagine the pressure and aggravation of having to heal someone, let alone a group, when your heals take 30% of your energy and your attacks restore 0.2%. That's the hell I live every time I try to do 8-man content or world bosses in this game.",

There are a ton of good things about this game! tons of content the community is mostly nice and helpful (if new: Always go on Youtube and look up boss fights and raids before entering) and with the new Director he is making big changes for the better to make the game more.... current.  What I DONT LIKE: is the pay wall. F2P until level 30, P2P for everything else after. You cant even finish the main story without buying the DLC's. Every additional Power must be bought with money and even some core items for gameplay. There is so much DLC that paying for all of it use to enjoy the game is annoying. also you have to 'subcribe' to use all your in-game money and inventory slots otherwise you have to put real money into getting access to use your ingame money once. (Tons of videos to see what i mean). You almost have to be rich to play the game at ever turn there's a pay wall.   MINI ISSUES: Graphics, Unreal engine and animations are all outdates (like most mmorpg looks the same as it did 5 years ago) animations and phyics can be annoying. UI is 5 years old and is super buggy. everyone uses the same powers for maximum damage (might be changing soon see DCUO Forums)  I will change my review when the game changes. I love the game because its awesome I get to be a superpowered freak of nature around almost all my fav super heroes and villains. I've learned a lot about DC from playing this and am very passionate about it but these are my thoughts. there are good changes coming to the game soon but it is worth playing just not really worth all the money atm.",

Main reason: I played that game back then( 3 years ago) because it was hard, you will never find any other game, that will have the same difficulty as this game had (the dificulty came from the mechanics of this game, it was not a question about gear, but your own personal skills (think of 'dark souls')), therefore it was a challenge, it made me search for a good guild and find friends, if you wanted to play solo... forget it, thats what i liked. good guilds formed and competed with each other, everyone wanted to be the first and the best, and to acomplish it, you just needed your personal skills, no grinding for best gear, no p2w, only subscribe to play.  Other reasons: Unique combat which was revolutionary when this game released, and still, until now i didnt find any other MMO where the combat is better or even the same. The best part about combat is, that you not only push your buttons and wait for the boss to die, the game asks you to do something special while fighting, so you have to interrupt combat. this way every single fight becomes unique and requires its own tactics. this feature is also unique, there is no other game that has it. This game is simple, there is not much crafting like in other mmos, no gathering 100 different types of materials, no upgrading gear to +20, no special bonusses on gear, which you have to study to understand and pay incredible amount of money to buy from other players to get or spend incredible amount of time grinding dungeons and hope it drops and what not all those WoW inspired MMOs have. because of this, this game has to provide hard content, where players fail and spend time trying to finish it, otherwise there would be not much to do, and it worked well back then, but the dificulty was so high, that many ppl complained, that they could not finish content, because they lack personal skill and are unable to play as team and use tactics, so the devs desided to lower the dificulty and make it basically a brainAFK grindy game and every 3d month they release another content to grind, all players, who played this because of the high difficulty left and the game turned into a ghosttown, now the game slowly filles with players, because other players start to play who is ok with all the grinding,  So if you are OK with brainAFK playstyle then definetly go for it, you will see a masterpiece of a MMO. earlyer i would have given it a YES, but because this game right now is nothing but a huge grind (in the end game), i will give it a no.",

Originally, the developing company hyped up the game, promising everything from customizable player housing, villian and hero PvP that would be well-balanced and enjoyable, as well as a relentless assault on the typical flavor of the week scenarios and power upgrades. They promised scenarios and power types that have actually existed in the DC comic genre. Out of all of their promises, they've fulfilled two. In a ratio based item, that's 2:45.  In general, that's bad business. When they discovered that they were unable to or were expected to keep their promises, they quickly went the route of the current MMO genre; free to play. Since then, the game has constantly had ill-repairs, downtime, unmet promises, and very, very low expectations. It is just one step above Champions Online, save for the strange Mortal Combat type figurations for certain attack moves (down, down-right, right anyone?). DC Universe actually has a storyline, which is impressive given its current state of affairs in-game. Character customization is lacking. The developing company (mainly their PR branch) continues to promise amazing new feats, outfits, and customization that will resurrect its game in a manner that would put an unnamed fellow from 2000 some years ago to shame. Unfortunately, thus far, they've only been able to resurrect a continual decline in player data-base, as well as overall effectiveness.

This is sad and not what a company should want to portray to new and renewed users on their first couple days of playing. As has been stated before, this game should be called DC Universe Offline.",

It went free to play and I tried it out again much later and it was fun for kicking around in PvE and I leveled a few more toons to the cap level of 30. I have 3 level 30 Villains and 3 level 30 Heroes.  PvE: The grind to get into raiding is more than I have ever seen in an MMO and I have played a lot of them. Game mechanics for raids are very poor. You expect to be leveling a very active controller character and end up standing around with your thumb up your butt just handing out energy to the tanks and healer. The one big raiding guild that I had joined was full of 'lifers' (people who had purchased a lifetime subscription to the game) and they added their own drama to the game to spice it up... I was banned for being 'a potential spy'...   PvP: The PvP mechanics in the arenas are evolutionary, however severely unbalanced even more than other MMOs. Open World PvP is similar mechanics where there is a mirror world where everyone can PvP no matter your level. Level 30s often squish low level players for kicks.  Social: The game keeps coming out with new paid expansions, however the population continues to dwindle. I still have the game installed because I like the PvE fighting mechanics. It's fun to watch some of the combos and devastation in your wake. Hardly anyone reads the chat, and its near imposable to get into an active guild because most of them are dead.   Opinion: It's fun to tool around with a buddy, just don't expect to be able to play with your friends right away. The introduction to the game is roughly 15-30 mins long depending on your experience with the game. I still keep it installed just to pop in from time to time and beat down some mobs.",

To fix this I tried just about everything. While I was trying to fix the problem my account password was not working so I reset it and it still did not work. I waited a day and that was finnaly working. If anyone could give me suggestions on how to fix it I will give it a try but until it is fixed this is the most frustrating game ever!",
