            "review_text": "What is Hatoful Boyfriend? Hatoful Boyfriend is a bird dating sim.  I purchased this because I thought it would be funny to say that I was playing a bird dating sim. There wasn’t suppose to be any real feelings behind this purchase, it was all in jest.   I launched the game and quickly got to the bad ending. I figured I should at least complete one or two “good” endings before I uninstalled the game and abandoned it to be just another game in my library. To accomplish my goal of being able to complete a good ending, I quickly made a “birds.txt” where I would list everybody in the story with a couple words to allow me to remember who was who.  Ryouta : Childhood friend, sick Sakuya : ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Yuuya : Works in infirmiry, upperclassmen, half brother of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, flirt Nageki : Library silent dude San : RUN RUN RUN RUN RUN Kazuaki : Homeroom / math teacher, falls asleep Shuu : Doctor   Referencing this “cheat sheet”, I was able to get a good ending fairly easily. I repeated myself, this time going for a different ending...sometime in this third playthrough, something changed.  By the end of that ending, I was actually enjoying what I was doing. This “Joke of a game” was actually drawing me in, not because of “bird dating sim”, but because of the actual plot and the compelling characters. My cheat sheet was pointless, I knew all the names. Everybirdie had their own personality, and their stories had wildly different outcomes, yet were all tied together to help reveal a plot that actually mattered.   As you play through the game more, and achieve different endings you find little bits and pieces about the world. You read how birds became the dominant lifeform on the planet, how the human race almost fell to extinction, and how bird politics work.  Each story feel completely different. They all showcase a huge variety of emotions and social conditions. One story / ending exists entirely for humor, and no deep thought is put into anything. You are able to laugh your way through a 20 minute story and have a great time. You re-roll your game, and suddenly your story is filled with great sorrow between all the funny bird puns. Sadness then turns into happiness as your story becomes complete. Re-roll again, now you are exploring yet more bird puns, but this time also the impossible expectations sometimes forced onto oneself from their family. Re-roll, now genocide is brought into the fold. Re-roll, we are happy and excited again.  What the hell just happened? This game somehow managed to put an actual fantastic plot full of emotion and lessons of how the world works into...a bird dating simulator. Somehow this completely over the top game idea is completely overlooked the more you play it and fall in love with it.    Everybirdie should download this game and try it out because “lol bird dating sim”. You’ll be amazed as the joke suddenly starts being enjoyable and the fact that everyone is a bird spouting bird puns is able to be completely overlooked.  What is Hatoful Boyfriend? Hatoful Boyfriend is a fantastic game filled with more emotion and story than it should possibly contain.",

Then, the eve before my birthday, a close friend had stealthily bought Hatoful Boyfriend and sent it to me, thinking it'd be a funny early birthday present. I decided to humor him, and booted up the game on that one fateful Saturday night.  My house burned down, I lost my job, my wife divorced me and took custody of the children, and my pizza delivery guy was late.

I thought this would just be a lighthearted, funny game I could play for some kicks and giggles. Don't get me wrong, the actual romance storylines were pretty hilarious in nature, like the part in Ryota's romance where you get a peek at his job (if you've played the game you'll know what I'm talking about).   Honestly, I wasn't expecting much from this though besides the joke about it being a pigeon dating sim... until I got to the BBL storyline. Without spoiling anything, let me just say the BBL storyline/ending has nothing to do with romance. It gives you a huge insight on all the characters, their pasts, and how they're all connected. It's rather long compared to just romancing one of your bird companions, but well worth playing through. The BBL storyline/ending does not give you much choice options and is more like a visual novel, but I really appreciated how the developer chose to make it. For me, it turned this simple pigeon dating sim into something far more complicated and intriguing. It is also the reason that this game has become one of my favorite games I've played in a long while.  I give this game a 10/10 purely for the BBL storyline/ending.   11/10 for being a pigeon dating sim :p",

But knowing me I looked over those birds and went for the psycopathic doctor. &lt;3  TL;DR: You date a bunch of birds but there's a much darker story behind that silly dating sim. Just do it.  The only con would be that the story's just the same thing over and over, that is if you're trying to get all the endings like me.

My first run,I decided to date my math prof.Loved how he always felt asleep,and since my girlfriend watched me play,we were giving hilarious voices to everybirdie.I ended up managing to date him,and after this success I rushed back into the game.Next came Nageki,and there we both were shocked at the issue of this relationship.I ended up dating everyone,and especially loved Okosan's and Anghel's endings.Laughing at it's maximum,especially when you're with good company.  After a while,I couldn't stop playing.And one day...they gave me the choice to fullfil a promise.I looked at it wierd,and decided to not do it yet because I had endings to do still.  Finally,I decided to go in and fullfil those promises this night,on my own,without anyone else.I started the game and decided to date Ryouta just to see the difference.Even though there was some wierd messages from time to time...The run went as usual.Until one day... /! SPOILERS FROM BAD BOY'S LOVE FROM NOW ON!/  Until the day Ryouta found my head in a box,while every other classes found parts of my body in others.It was a shock to see that this adventure got bloody.With extreme shock and thirsth of knownledge,I decided to keep going,and find the truth...  Everything went so fast,yet so slow.This dating sim has transformed into a dark thriller.Every seconds I was awaitting the Scarecrow to appear.Every seconds I was questionning things but never did I answer them.  After 3 hours in this run,I reached the end of Bad Boy's Love.I now know the truth behind this storyline. And here I am,tears to the eyes,salt to the lips,my mind questionning restless...  I was wrong about this game.When I first bought it,it looked funny.When I first played it,it was hilarious.When I played a lot,it grew tiresome but always so perfect.When I discovered the truth...It wasn't so funny anymore.I didn't know anymore who was evil,who was good,or who should be killed.I only know that this game is not any dating sim.  This game...There is no words.My tears are still flowing,even after the 20 minutes I spent writting this.I still ask myself questions,and answered few.",

Just listen, I'm going somewhere with this okay? *sigh* Okay, without further ado, I present to you...  LASTING IMPRESSIONS Hatoful Boyfriend  GENRE Dating Simulator/Visual Novel  STORY In Hatoful Boyfriend you take the role of Hiyoko Tosaka, a human going to a prestigious highschool for birds. The school in question is St. Pigeonation’s, and it's known mostly for being the world's greatest gathering place for birds. You're a sophomore now, but you haven't done much to adjust to the atmosphere of Pigeonation's just yet. You're not entirely lost though, as you also have one of the several woo-able birds with you, your hardworking best friend Ryouta Kawara. Along with him you can also bond with narcoleptic math teacher Nanaki Kazuaki, bashful aristocrat Sakuya Le Bel Shirogane, distant bookworm Fujishiro Nageki, suave ladies' man Sakazaki Yuuya, enigmatic doctor Iwamine Shuu, and hyperactive track star Okosan. With so much romance in the air, it's hard to believe the school holds so many dark secrets...  GAMEPLAY Ever read a book online? It's like that except every once in a while the books asks which choice you want to make. The choices you make will determine which bird you end up with, along with which ending you get for them. [Provided you don't get indesicive and go the way of the dodo, of course.] Each day you will be asked which class you want to take; this decides which trait will be leveled for that day. As previously mentioned, this will affect which ending you get for your desired bird.  VISUALS Not much to say. It's pictures of birds with various backgrounds. The backgrounds look very nice, and there's quite a large amount of them. You also get a little end card pictures for your gallery after the end of each route. They're gosh darned cute.  SOUNDTRACK The soundtrack is a delightful mix of royalty-free, classics, and original [I think?] tracks. All of them fit perfectly with any of the situations at hand. [Except maybe when Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy plays, that's always just plain silly.] There's many tracks from Kevin MacLoed and SENTIVE; the sexy, suave Dispersion Relation, Simply Blue, Daybreak [Personal favorite.], and tons of ones with gibberish for names. The collector's edition is worth is just for the beautiful OST.  SEQUELS [SPOILERS] Hatoful Boyfriend is the quintessential example of an idea that I've had for a while now; some games should never get sequels. While it's obvious that a bad game shouldn't deserve a sequel; I'm of the opinion that if a game is GOOD enough it shouldn't HAVE a sequel. If a game does all that it wishes, if a game provides a fulfilling, complete experience; it would be insulting to continue where the game left off. You may be thinking 'How does a game about dating birds provide a fulfilling experience?' I'll tell you; it's because the entire dating sim portion of the game is a mere facade. Once you've completed all possible routes at least once, you have the option to unlock BBL; a grim narrative that reveals the lore behind this game's world, the motivations and sins of characters, and completes all story arcs. The dating sim part of Hatoful Boyfriend is there simply to set up characters so that you know who this story is centered around. You know how they act by then, what their situations are, and this only helps to greatly strengthen the story. It's a fantastic conclusion, and it's one that left me speechless. Which brings us back to sequels. As I've said, a sequel to this game woud be a downright insult; a direct sequel that is. A direct sequel would be insulting, as the game would have nowhere to go with the current story; all arcs are completed. However, an indirect sequel would be a very, very smart idea if done correctly. By merely taking the characters we know and love and putting them in a different kind of story; the game has somewhere to go. Oh, and it did go somwhere, as an indirect sequel exists. [Holiday Star is its name if you were wondering. Not yet on steam though.]  FINAL THOUGHTS I dove this game. To say that this was a pheasant experience would be the understatement of the century. While at first glance, it may look like quite the bad egg, it's surely a narrative you'll never forget. I'm talon you, it's all here! Great soundtrack, amazing characters, bird puns; it's just a quail of a time! The price ain't nothin to go squawkin' about neither, no need to worry about some ludicrous bill. This is the defenition of the phrase 'more than meets the eye' and you'd have to be some hard boiled individual not to enjoy the humor at the least. I know I'm gushing, but I just can't recommend this enough! While you're at it, make sure to kill two birds with one stone and buy the collector's edition with it. The soundtrack alone makes it worth it. Alright, I've egged you on for far too much now, I'll sparrow you of any more. Hatoful Boyfriend has left a resounding lasting impression; it's not what the source material is, it's what you do with it that makes it a golden goose egg. You've got your ducks in a row MediaTonic, keep it up.  And now, in Japanese tradition, a haiku. Hatoful Boyfriend, A dating sim about birds. I was not prepared.",

            "review_text": "In Hatoful Boyfriend, you play as Hiyoko Tosaka (or whatever you choose to name her), the only human in a school of pigeons. You can even get yourself a birdy boyfriend! There's Ryouta the childhood friend, Sakuya the fancypants, Yuuya the ladies man, and many more amazing avians. It plays out like a regular otome/visual novel does, read the text and make some choices. I bet you're thinking 'omg so random, dating pigeons lol', and that's a natural response. But if you were to look up the definition of 'don't judge a book by its cover', I'm pretty sure there would be a picture of Hatoful Boyfriend there.  You see, the pigeon dating sim premise is just a cover for the real story. After you unlock certain endings with different birds, you can start a new game and the true story will reveal itself, aka the Hurtful Boyfriend (or Bad Boys Love) route. In BBL you will learn why Hiyoko is the only human at the pigeon school, why the pigeons can talk, why she needs to form a bond with the birds, and much more. I can only say so much without spoiling it, but be prepared for a mental meltdown. It is filled with drama, tragedy and unsettling content. After seeing certain endings in the dating sim part, you'll probably be thinking 'well, I've already seen some disturbing stuff... This will be a piece of cake'. LOL NOPE. The dating sim endings are nothing compared to the true BBL route.   To put it simply, this game is like one of those sweet &amp; sour candies; it looks and tastes sweet on the outside, but once you delve deeper in you'll reel back in shock and wonder wtf happened to the sugary outer shell.",

And upon completing your first playthrough and finding a pigeon to be your soulmate, this would be an entirely accurate assumption to make. However, the real depth of this game surfaces with each continual playthrough. Something far more sinister is happening at St. Pigeonation's. You will eventually find out the answer to almost any question you may have had when you first heard of the game. Why is everyone a bird? Why are you a human? Who is the Hatoful Boyfriend? The path to this knowledge will take a lot of perseverance, but you will be surprised by the outcome.",

            "review_text": "Initially, Hatoful Boyfriend struck me as a purely comedic otome game. Like many who chose to play it, I decided to go through it for kicks. Eventually, I learned that it is not what it seems at all. The more I progressed through the game the more immersed I became in it. I forgot all about the fact that it was meant to be a dating simulator where you court birds. I learned that it possesses all the trappings of classic visual novels. It is rife with plot twists and angst. The story is surprisingly deep, something I found to be a relief. As you go through the routes you obtain more and more pieces of the proverbial puzzle. They fit together pretty nicely at the end. I was glad to know that it is more than just some silly thing.  Although it has many elements and troupes that are common in such games it presented them in a unique way, I think. However, my taste for it was admittedly acquired. After having went through a route in its entirety I became bored of many of the jokes and scenarios which had been scattered throughout it. For a time it was a bit of a chore to go through. Thankfully, the skip button helps you rush through the things you have already read, cutting out unnecessary game-time. You definitely need to be patient when going through Hatoful Boyfriend. I personally feel that in order to get the most enjoyment out of it you should go through one route at a time. That way you will have plenty of time to reflect on what happened as well as keep your interest in the plot fresh.  PROS:  &gt; Overall, Hatoful Boyfriend is short and sweet. A basic route can be finished in an hour even if you are a slow reader. This makes it a great thing to play before going to bed or when you just need to kill some time for a while.  &gt; The art is soft, and the scenery colorful, making the backdrops pleasant. It is simple, but is still able to add to the mood.  &gt; While many of the characters and their stories are tried-and-true they are still ones you can get attached to (for the most part, anyway).  &gt; There is more than one unlockable route.  &gt; The story becomes more advanced as you progress through the game.  CONS:  &gt; The protagonist is simple and impressionable.  &gt; During the main routes you do not get a lot of route-exclusive content. A lot of the scenarios are the ones you go through during the main story, so you end up having to read through much of what you already have.  &gt; The running gags get old fast.  &gt; You are unable to save at decision screens and must do so just before you are about to make a choice.  &gt; There are very few CGs.  &gt; Sometimes your saves will bring you to a backdrop and you cannot do anything at all so you have to exit and re-open the game (save your game in multiple slots just in case!).  All in all, I think that Hatoful Boyfriend is enjoyable. I feel that it rewards you well for your diligence. The final, true story that is Hatoful Boyfriend is great. I absolutely love the BBL ending, and think that it was worth all the time I spent working to get it. I believe that it is a fairly solid purchase.  ",

The characters are great, all with distinct personalities, including the main character. Unlike some other dating sims, it doesn't branch off into a separate route for each character you date --instead, the new stuff for each character is interspersed between scenes common to each character... expect to be hitting the skip button a lot. The amount of new content for each character is pretty good, though.  The real meat of the game is when you unlock the final route after completing all the other routes. To put this in perspective, there are 15 endings (not counting an epilogue). I read all of the dialogue out loud with my friend, using the skip button for dialogue we already saw before. It took 10 hours to do the 14 normal routes and 6 hours to do the final route alone-- that's how big the difference is. So make sure you do the final route, since it's a huge amount of the game and it really ties everything together well.  Where the game fell short for me was in the implementation. There were a number of annoying technical aspects that really detracted from the game. One was the skip button, which sometimes failed to skip past old dialogue and would also skip past new dialogue. Another big one was the save games, which do not work if you have the game installed somewhere other than your C drive-- a real annoyance with the really long final route. And then there were just some small annoyances like unnecessary extra clicks (such as having to click twice before every choice), the slow speed of the scene transitions, and a ton of typos... which were actually kind of entertaining, but still.  Even so, the game is worth playing. It might not be the most polished VN you'll ever play, but it has some solid writing and is just a really fun experience.",

Everytime I start the game with a new goal, a new bird to date I get sucked into this amazing story about both their lives and the world we live in. Never in my life I would have thought that this game was just as amazing as it actually is. I really love this game, even more for everytime I play it.  I am going to get all the achievements before I am done with this game. Still it had such an impact on me that I will think of it when I am not playing, for a while.  I give this a 10/10.

But to make list a few complaints:    The game is quite poorly coded and thus sometimes hard to use with a mouse. More specifically, there are minor bugs like the fast forward button or choices not working.    Additionally to the above, you can't click fast forward in certain situations, even though it would work if you clicked it before that screen appeared.    You can affect weather with your decisions.    The game presents you with choices that make absolutely no difference on the way that further conversations with specific characters go. The only consequence is that at one moment near the end you either die, or the story moves forward, and a bit later you get one of the possible endings with chosen character.    These glorious conversations with Ryouta:      You: I hope your mother will get better.   Ryouta: No, she won't. *runs away crying* (oh, did she die? :( )   [later]   R: My mom feels better!

It is a fun game, and great that it offers a fast forward option when you want to skip sections you have read already (such as the beginning). Progressing through the story isn't terribly long for most endings, and trying to get each birdies ending is fairly straight forward. This game is easily replayable, especially when you unlock more endings, and can easily get you hooked. I suggest buying it on sale, however full price isn't terrible either. My only quarrel is sometimes getting a full ending for a character may not always be clear cut, and thus having to restart a new game may be cumborsome, and one of the endings took a little longer than I would have liked (regardless of how interesting it got). It's a great game and earns and 8 out of 10 stars. Something Everbirdie would love, so go find your husbandove  P.S. I'm putting this game as a nomination for The “I Thought This Game Was Cool Before It Won An Award” Award.

And you are right, but that is not the whole truth; beneath its satirical surface, Hatoful Boyfriend hides a gripping story that turns it into a very solid Visual Novel.  + The silly humour makes this VN accessible even to those who are not into Japanese culture, making it excellent (and affordable) for those seeking to dip into the genre; + While short, the main routes are solid and varied, ranging from tear-jerkers to plain WTF, with some hilarity in between (try Okosan's route first of all!) + The 'hidden' (and arguably 'canon') route presents a very interesting darker tale; + The OST and visuals are not mind-blowing, but they are pleasant and do their job.   +- While I did say it was a fine VN for beginners, it is still a parody of the dating sim genre and thus some of its content might fly over your head; +- The ending of the 'hidden' route might be considered too convoluted by some, although I would say the journey is still worth it, no matter what opinion you might have of the ending.  - While the main routes being a bit on the short side isn't a big deal and not something I can complain too much about considering the game's price, I do think some routes could've been fleshed out a little more; - The translation has some typos and English oddities.  VERDICT: If you think that this game is just a gimmick, play it and let yourself be surprised! With more than what meets the eye (you can easily clock 6-8h if you complete all routes), Hatoful Boyfriend was an excellent surprise and should be considered by all those who enjoy Visual Novels or plot-heavy games. If you are looking for gameplay-heavy elements, however, you WILL be disappointed, but that's just how VNs are.",

Radical political parties, genocide, experimentation, biological warfare, murder, pudding--just to name a few--are all themes you'll encounter in this game.  You are a human transfer student in a school specifically for birds. Unbeknownst to you, your mission is to woo every bird in the school, albeit one at a time in separate playthroughs. Each bird has different interests, personalities, and backstories, but the more you play, the more you'll realize that they're all intertwined, and that there's something terribly sinister going on at your school behind the scenes. Once you've seduced every bird and achieved every ending, you are rewarded with a chance to 'fulfill the promise,' and solve a mystery that will leave you on the edge of your seat for hours.  Hatoful Boyfriend is beyond deceptive in its marketing as a joke, and I hadn't expected that it would tell a wonderfully written story that would leave me in tears at its end.  --  My only gripe about Hatoful Boyfriend is the spotty save system, as so many others seem to have issues with, too. I would occasionally need to load a save only to find that it would load a background without characters, text, or interface, forcing me to Alt+F4 to leave the game. The save file was forever corrupted, and I would have to restart that particular storyline. The dating playthroughs are short enough to finish in single sittings, but the finale can take hours to finish. I would recommend playing the finale only if you know you have a lot of free time ahead of you, at least until the save issues are fixed. I will amend this review should they be resolved.

First of all, the cons:   It's got a clunky interface for a VN, where you can't read previous text, remove the text to look at the pictures, and if you're trying to skip to get to the route you want, it's pretty slow and tedious. Some of the achievements are 'get the ending' and 'get the full ending', which are pretty much the same. And some graphical assets seem much less HD than others.  Ok, bit of a spoiler here. The dating sim portion is pretty short, the main chunk of the story is in the secret 'BBL' route, which you unlock after completing the dating sim routes.  That route is worth everything.  If you do not find yourself emotionally involved when reading it... perhaps you should seek out a doctor. Ho ho ho.",

It'd seem like it'd give my friends a good giggle.'  I did not know what to expect.  The concept may seem silly at first, and it still kind of does, but when you actually play it, this game is not a joke. A lot of heart and soul went into the writing and I can see that the developers did not screw around. My first playthrough left me a little confused, but the more you play, taking different routes, the more you uncover of the story and lore and you see how complex and interesting the world of Hatoful actually is.  The characters are interesting and diverse from the creepy Shuu, to the pudding loving Okosan. Going through each path allows you to uncover more and more about these characters and become more attached as you go on. Your first playthrough may take you an hour or so (if you read the dialog you lazy dog) but later, each playthrough may take 20-40 minutes depending on the paths you take. The music sets the mood of the characters and the sound effects can really set the atmosphere.  Great, emotional visual novel/ dating simulator full of giggles and tears, would recommend.",

And to some degree, I agree with them. A great deal of this was only mildly entertaining and I did not understand why people (especially close friends of mine) loved this game. The game begins with the main character (a female... yes, you play a female in a dating sim...) starting her sophomore year [unsure if right or not] and during the next year dates several bird-boy-people-things... NOW, you must be wondering, 'Why is a girl dating birds!? How can she develop intimate feelings for these avian creatures!? HOW CAN THE BIRDS FRICKIN' ACT LIKE HUMAN BEINGS!?!?!?' Put those questions aside when you play the story, but just don't forget about them entirely.  Each character's dating route got progressively more funny and interesting the more I played it, EXCEPT FOR ONE which made me feel like I was mashing my head against a wall for doing something so inanely stupid as it was not a good route to take... If you play the game, you will know the one because you will think the main character is dumb. After playing through just about every route at least once, I unlocked a new route that was only available to begin in the beginning. THIS FINAL ROUTE, HOO BOY IT WAS A DOOZY!  This final route made the entire game so much more worth it, and answered soooooooo maaaaaannyyyyyy quuueeestions! OH, and if you want to do the epilogue, you need to get all endings before doing the Final Route (There are some characters with TWO endings, one being a normal ending and the other being a TRUE ending...).  I am not really going to talk about the final route too much, but let me just say that this game was a rollercoaster of funny moments and intense plots.  I TOTALLY RECOMMEND THIS GAME, but it sometimes felt annoying to play through a route again JUST for the epilogue... Good thing this game has a skip function to speed through text... Saved me MUCH MORE TIME than I would have done, if that function wasn't in the game.  In short, if you love games with fantastic stories, GET THIS GAME NOW!",

The bonus ending (the BBL route) was one of the more compelling game (and VN) stories I remember reading made from such seemingly simple and ridiculous premises. I don't even know how they made all the story parts so intervowen, when at first they seemed so random. It was worth unlocking all the slightly repetitive playthroughs to get to it. For anyone wondering why this game is interesting - wait until you get to the last part.

This leads to a lot of self-referential and fourth-wall-breaking humor. Not as much as in a Deadpool comic, but still enough for frequent grins and occasional belly laughs.  Despite being single-player, this is a great 'couples' game. I played through most of it with my spouse watching, and we had more fun with it than with an episode or two of most of our favourite TV shows. For an example of how this works out, check the Hatoful Boyfriend playthrough on Genna Bain's YouTube channel (she plays it with her husband, a professional game reviewer).  There's definitely replay value, but not much mystery about the storyline. If you've EVER seen a high school anime, you'll see 'twists' coming from several miles away. For what it's worth, my ending (I dated one of the aristocrats) didn't resolve much of anything and left every major plot point hanging. Bad form, but the rest of the playthrough was fun.",

Probably one of my favorite things about this game is (besides dating birds of course) is the fact that the actual endings aren't all going to be 'and they skipped off into the sunset to make like 12 babies'. Some of these endings, spoilers will be blocked out, are actually very realistic given the circumstances    Nanaki's comes to mind first  . And the writing is very funny at some parts, but doesn't try to force the laugh which makes it weird.  I did notice though a few coding issues. The very last choice in Shuu's true end only showed one of the three options. Then the other showed (enough of a delay I thought they devs had actually only made it one choice). This very well be myst my machine though. Also, when you level up in the classroom, there is a blank textbox when it plays the level up noise and you have to click enter again to get the actual level up text. And in my time playing it I've seen only one typo.  But, those issues are easily overlooked, this is a great game for people who aren't super into dating sims and want something that is both well written but not too into itself. This game will draw you in by the idea of bird dating and will trap you in it with well written characters and well done, just realistic enough romances.  And when you unlock the Bad Boy's Love route it will all just keep going. It's almost like a DLC, but comes witht he game. It introduces a plot it never even hinted would be unlocked and clears up a lot more character story and loose ends. Along with giving you more insight to the world outside the school.  At a price to the player character, of course.  EDIT: I'm having trouble loading save games. It shows me the BG and character I was speaking to and plays music but no text box. Be warned.",

            "review_text": "Hatoful Boyfriend takes a fun one-note gag of dating birds and executes it flawlessly, then executes half a dozen other things flawlessly while it's at it. It constantly mixes up its approach, and the result is a story that manages to be hilarious, goofy as all hell, but also legitimately touching.  Ultimately, playing Hatoful is something of a question of sincerity. Yes, the world and story are totally bananas. But the game's willingness to change tone on a dime and play things completely straight leads to no small number of poignant moments. The world of St. Pigeonation's is absurd, but is it really any more absurd than the latest tale of heroic space marines, robo-Nazis, or godlike gangsters? Not really, and at some point, after dealing with characters that act, talk, hope, and fear just like people, you're going to stop caring that their portrait is a ridiculous looking bird. And then, just when you start to get a little emotional, it's going to hit you in the face with another pie.  If there's a downside, it's that the actual gameplay can get a little tedious. A huge chunk of the game doesn't open up until you've romanced all of the birds, and a few of the birds have 'normal' vs. 'perfect' endings that make for two near-identical playthroughs. So after a few times through, you'll want to pull up a guide (and thankfully there are some good ones) and make judicious use of the fast-forward button to breeze through repeat content. I promise it's worth it, though.",

Don't let the fact you're going through the standard intro yet again bore you into quitting- the story diverges greatly from what you've played, and actually gets very interesting (assuming you can suspend you disbelief at the level the novel asks you to). Yeah, there are a few misspellings and instances of poor grammar (just as with the rest of the game). But, if you're willing to do that, and don't mind linearity, then yes, this is worth the full price. If not...  The normal game does a good job deconstructing the high school dating visual novel cliches, and the fact you're a human girl vying for the affections of a bird only adds a bit more humor to it. There's a fast-forward feature that skips to the next day or decision, so replays aren't that painful. My favorite endings in the standard game are the ones for the Fallen Angel, best Track Star, and best Doctor. If you're not willing to go through all the endings and don't want to go through the bonus story, then I'd wait for it to go on sale. If you're more of a completionist, I'll say it again- I was very impressed by the bonus story, and completely taken by surprise that the writers could craft some junkfood for the mind that good. The bonus epilogue isn't that good, so it's up to how much of a completionist you are if you shoot for that as well. But the bonus story is worth the money and the effort of unlocking it.",

I never felt compelled to write one, even on games I have played until I memorized character's lines. I just never felt like I wanted to.  So the fact that I'm even writing one should say a bit.  If you are anything like me, you'll buy this as a gag. Just to see HOW YOU CAN RELEASE A BIRD DATING SIM that will ACTUALLY SELL. Seriously, I couldn't even believe what I was reading. I haven't even PLAYED a dating sim before, just shooters and RPGs. EXTREMELY non-feminine games. But as soon as you actually start, you begin treating it as an actual video game, one that you may even like. So even if you're just kinda 'huh, this looks weird', BUY IT, SERIOUSLY.  Best $2.50 investment I have EVER made.  Fat birds are now seen as evil in my eyes.  Pudding has been made into a whole new context.

Some of the art isn't super great (the backgrounds can be a little blotchy) and the music is just classic cheesy dating sim stuff, but it's all pretty decent anyway.

WARNING - SERIOUS SPOILERS AHEAD  On a surface level, this is like any other Japanese dating sim - except with pigeons. As Pigeonations High School's only human student, Hiyoko Tosaka, you have the option of romancing a number of birds, each with their own unique personality and backstory, and can even unlock secret birds. Most dating scenarios end with a surprisingly heavy twist, even if you achieve the 'good ending'. The atmosphere of the dating scenarios is very bright and pleasant for the most part. The humour, and there's a lot of it (some possibly unintentional and resulting from the translation), adds a lot to the game.   SPOILER WARNING AGAIN  But the dating scenarios are just a facade. The true game is unlocked by achieving the good ending for a few certain birds. Once you have unlocked it, you find yourself in a post-apocalyptic, dystopian world wherein the majority of the human race succumbed to the avian flu. As a result of experiments conducted on birds to combat the virus, birds have gained sentience and human-like characteristics and intelligence, and now rule the earth. Hiyoko, the human protagonist, is gruesomely murdered, and all Pigeonations students are under lockdown. Playing as Ryouta, your duty is to discover the disturbing circumstances of Hiyoko's death, and reveal the true nature of Operation Hatoful.",

But when my character mentioned   being a hunter-gatherer   within the first few minutes, I knew that there had to be more to it than that.  As I continued through the game, I found that it was not only much more amusing than I'd expected, but that the characters were genuinely engaging--particularly Okosan (tiny brain, big heart), Sakuya (imagine if Draco Malfoy were a) likeable and b) a fantail pigeon), and Yuuya (a mysterious ladies' man). The first time I played, I got the bad ending because I liked all of the birds so much that I couldn't decide which one to focus on!  After that, I felt like I had to stick around and get all of the characters' endings. It helped that after the first run-through, there was a fast forward button that allowed me to skip sequences I'd seen before. Following most endings, I'd find a new entry in the 'Archive' section of the game that hinted at a convoluted backstory. And once I'd finished with all that, I found a new option available in the beginning of the game that unlocked the  real  story, which was unexpectedly dark and twisted.   This is honestly one of the most entertaining games I've ever played and I would recommend it to just about anyone. I'm picking up the sequel as soon as I post this review.",

There are at least a couple of story arcs that made me want to cry, and THAT is something that I was not expecting AT ALL. This game is fantastic. It knows that it is absurd, and takes full advantage of that fact.  but it also manages to get you to take it seriously, too, and that was one of the things about this game that impressed me the most; a game about a human dating pigeons that manages to evoke strong emotions, has a deeper underlying story, and most importanly, makes you feel like most of the characters are more than just silly pictures of pigeons on a computer screen: this game gives everyone a personality and a story, and it makes characters appear far simpler than they truly are multiple times. Every new playthrough gives you a new understanding of the characters and makes them that much more like real people.",

The setting is refreshing, at first glance. Instead of being surrounded by handsome dudes, you are amid a bunch of cute and intelligent birds that you'd wonder how you are gonna make love with them heehee. However that is about the only difference between this game and other cheap dating sims - the appearance of your potential boyfriends are birds instead of humans. The endings are all too easy to achieve. And in order to play the bonus ending, which is a huge plus to this game, you'd have to acquire all characters' endings first, and that can get hella boring when you don't find certain characters appealing (aka Shuu).   Pros: -Birdie boyfriend 3&gt;3&gt; -The BBL Ending, it is practically a free DLC and is pretty neat -Characters are likable -Some nice feels in certain endings -Straightforward steam achievements (and not too hard to get) -It is neat how love can be triggered and grow so easily between two 'creatures?'  Cons: -Grinding for endings to unlock the bonus ending can get boring -No real bad endings -Too much dry and dumb humor (poorly written goofiness) -Little to no character development -Certain plot twists are too abrupt -Wayyyyy too obvious on how to hunt down your targetted birdie  TL;DR Only buy the game when it is on sale. The first couple playthroughs and the bonus ending are nice but also forgetable.",

One thing I appreciate is that Hatoful Boyfriend doesn't try to convince you that characters that are unlikable and/or creepy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are appealing love interests. You pursue them for the sake of game completion, knowing full well that your character's getting into something unappealing and possibly even dangerous. In some cases you might be surprised at what you find out. So you keep doing it anyway.  I've played otome where you're wooing some misogynistic jerk or antisocial personality, and you're supposed to believe you'd actually willingly fall for that for the off chance he might turn out having some redeemable quality or sympathetic sob story. I can't stand that.  I like Hatoful Boyfriend--but keep in mind, the only other otome I've played that I liked was Idea Factory's Hakuoki, a game based on Japan's Meiji era where the members of the Shinsengumi basically become vampires to avoid their historical deaths.

            "review_text": "Normally I'm not a fan of love stories. I often find them boring and in most cases predictable. Still I tried some Otome games out, because I was curious. In the end I just got confirmed what I thought beforehand: Dating Sims, wether they're for girls or boys, are pubertal immature sex/romantical fantasies which feature stupid stories and stereotypical/sexist/sexualised characters.  I despise this genre of video games.  But then I heard of Hatoful Boyfriend and that it would be a parody on this genre. That got me interested and I bought it.  And I absolutely don't regret it!  You're going to a school, can choose a route with a specific character you like and fall in love with him. Due to that you can get different endings. If you want to see all endings you have to play it several times. The basics are absolutely the same as in other Dating Sims.  But the differences are awesome!  Let's begin with the protagonist: She's not a weak, whining little girl like in most other games, but actually likeable and funny- due to the game having a satirical undertone. I just couldn't stand the protagonists which I've met in other games, they were extremely annoying.  I think it's definitely doing justice to it's reputation of being a parody. It's poking fun at rpg games, at PETA, at generic anime situations and also at stupid gender roles.  Dialogues are on the one hand very funny and hilarious, but on the other much less stiff than in other games, but in certain occasions even very serious or sad.  While in other games characters are often superficially done, here the characters are lovely and have a well-thought-out background.  The story or rather stories (because of all the different characters) are well done! What I like about them is, that they make much more sense than in other games and are even logically. In other Dating Sims they're just stupidly predictable. But the endings here surprised me.  Then there's also this special route, which you can unlock if you have a specific number of endings. This special story answers the questions, that many had already in their head when they heard of this game the first time: Why birds?  I loved this route and how every other piece of story the player gathered while doing the other routes came together to one and explained everything that's going on there.  By the way: If you want to have every ending then you have to play the game several times. There's this nice fast forward button with which you can skip everything that you already know. Otherwise it would've been a bit frustrating, but fortunately that's not the case.  Hatoful Boyfriend also showed that game developers shouldn't be afraid to do something with the fate of the protagonist...   While other game developers do everything so that the protagonists doesn't die and can be the glorious hero in the end, here it is possible that you get an ending were you die.    To put it in a nutshell: I love this game. The characters, the story and the dialogues are awesome. And while it has a lot of funny moments, it has also some very serious, sad and deep moments. Don't be fooled by their appearance, those pigeons are much more human than you think.",
