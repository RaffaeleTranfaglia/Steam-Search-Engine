Because really there are better Idling games out there and this one is very unique. It comes with a story and it is actually a very dam good story. Unlike other Idle games that just focus on graphics this one does not. which is why i play it more then clicker heros or any other Idle game i have in my Library now",

Because I've played this game from early alpha, where you can only slap hyperion and barely have any hp left to win. I've seen my clones sitting there in the training tab, Whole 40k clones sitting on the training tab and wondering how much clones to Black-barring the skills. Ok enough for the rant, and here's my review.  You start with nothing. Except your name, gender, body, and your ability to create clone. The clones are what you get for doing nothing at the start of the game. And then you realize there's a training tab there. You clicked it and it shows you what can you do with your clone, let them train for you, the lazy one. Then, after a while, you realize that you can smack gods to create more things. Then after a few hours, you realize you just lost to some god. You get a rebirth, and starting your life again, just like reading from the start of this paragraph again. Only to realize you've lost hundreds of hours in this game.  And you realized, you are happy. Happy for a reason. Happy because you can smack more powerful gods.",

This game easily differs from other idle games because of its innovative system, I started playing it yesterday because I was bored and despite all the doubts I had at the start, I can say it was pretty enjoyable. It's only a matter of time until you can learn or even master the game.  Some people judged the book by its cover while doing their bad reviews and didn't really try to play it, but like I already said, this game is very good, but it's not easy to get into. It's also important to say that this game is not pay2win, all the real money stuff you can buy are very optional and act like a gift for the ones who support the developers. Also, don't underestimate this game potential because of the simple graphics. ",

I can't defend spending money on this now unless you do it just to support the developers. There is only one thing I could concider getting, but not as long as the prizing is as it is. I honestly cant understand why they have made their purchases this expensive. This is a small marked, there is (or at least shouldn't be) any competetive reason to keep players at a blanced playing field, the game isn't interesting, and the game isn't that good. Why are you holding people back from experiencing your game? You have people who don't have my patience, that won't bother with this game, and you have people who have my patience that won't bother spending money on this. The only crowd I can concive that you are making money on is kids. This would just be abuse.  TL:DR The game is free to try, but I don't think they have anything to support their expensive ingame purchases. And it's hurting them selves in the prosess.",

This is definitely the sort of game where you need to be patient to be able to do anything at all, but if you put the time into it, new things will unlock, and you will be able to create matter, build monuments, trade things and even convert those matter into planets and the such. And now I can see that there are new features added into the mix; I am really looking forward to playing with that. Overall,Idling to Rule the Gods is definitely something you should leave in the background whilst you do other things, and come back to see how the avatar 'you' did whilst you were elsewhere. I definitely recommend a try at the very least, maybe you can grow to like the charms of this strange little idle game.  EDIT: And now I found out that there are lores, detailed lores that outlines how you've came to be, why you are fighting creatures and gods, as well as how your powers came to be, and how they relates to gods. This is amazing and it tied the different pieces of game mechanics together. I have never expected such a detailed lore for this game, and now I am more glad than ever to have found this game again years after the last time I played it.",

The game is ugly; there's no denying that, but the underlying mechanics are polished and there's actually a dozen different things to split your non-time on. For the first couple of weeks of game play, I'd think I was done unlocking new goals only to discover yet another additional mechanic to level up. Then I looked closer at the Challenges and realized there's a load of reasons to reset from zero for even MORE permanent bonuses. I've been poking at this thing for most of a year and I haven't even built a galaxy yet.  If you're looking for a time-eating incremental idler, this is a good one. There are tons of different goals to work towards at your own pace and an honestly interesting back story told through an optional side menu.",
