I finished the bossfight in act two, then a scripted 'defend the artifact' mission triggered half way across the map. Before my troops could even get close, a bunch of lizardmen appeared and destroyed the artifact. Then the game crashed and when I loaded back in it seems I had to play the entire Act 2 again.  No autosaves or checkpoints on a long level? In 2016?",
