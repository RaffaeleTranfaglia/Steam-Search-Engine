If you love shooting people, crashing vehicles or fighting the police, then this ain't the game for you. Go buy GTA instead.  This game is set on a fictional LA 1940s. It gave a different vibe when traveling in the open world. The detective stuff like finding clues or asking suspects questions were good, though they could've done better, but is IS a 2011 game. Many have changed in the gameplay of games through the years. I kinda understand why the gunplay is kinda clunky or kinda basic because maybe they focused mainly on solving cases. It's just my opinion though, but it's still fun.  A very unique game. would recommend",

            "review_text": "There are games you know when you play that there hasn't been any real work put into it and most of the budget went into marketing. But there are some games that when you play, you KNOW that the sheer amount of creativity put into it and the expenses made to craft the experience and make a world has paid off.  And then there's LA Noire.  This game sets a new standard for the storytelling experience in games, not only with it's technology, but with it's excellent integration of good gameplay mechanics and using that as a way to unravel for yourself the world and it's mysteries.  The gameplay involved in solving the cases is pretty solid, with you scouting for clues that will later be used in interrogations. Though the clue-hunting is little more than a game of click-everywhere-until-something-happens, the meat is in the driving sequences and the interrogations. The driving sequences make full use of the fact that there's a big open world out there and anything could happen. Simply driving from one place to another is a nice experience as you see in full glory the love and patience with which Team Bondi recreated 1940s LA. Of course these can be skipped but you'll be missing out on the side missions which dot the city from time to time and can only be discovered if you take over the wheels.  But the true flavor comes from the interrogations. They used this technology masterfully in order to not only make the interrogations engaging, but also accessible with some exaggerations on the part of the actors which was done on purpose knowing full well the limitations this technology could have. Simply reading the expressions isn't enough since you also have to back up your accusations with evidence. This requires some thought and patience on your part and you need to read the descriptions of each clue carefully before using them. Suffice it to say that the game is worth it for these sequences and there are a LOT of them.  The story too is quite excellent with many noire elements, plot twists and an overarching conspiracy. LA Confidential, the 1997 movie set in around the same time, was a considerable influence for the game.  There are a few negatives though. Some cases felt like I wasn't really solving them. Even though ALL the cases have definitive culprits, there were a couple of cases where I felt I was simply going through the motions. The shooting isn't very good. The chase sequences on foot aren't really great as there are some navigation issues. Though the game is HUGE with MANY cases and the DLC also contributing to the list, there's not much to do outside the story missions which somewhat ruins the fact that these guys toiled so much to recreate this beautiful city. The PC port, though it has many of the features other PC ports lack like a good options menu and reasonable mouse support, it still is quite wonky though I wasn't too distracted by it.  Minor faults don't bring down this excellent game though. It is something I would definitely recommend to any gamer who wants to play a linear story-driven non-action intensive game. Suffice it to say that after I was done, I missed the game and felt just a little hollow inside.",

            "review_text": " Presentation   L.A. Noire has an excellent setting, Los Angeles in the 1940's, and everything the game has to offer feels very true to this setting.  The story of the game is very well written, offering insight to life in the 1940's overall as well as focusing even more on the lives of cops, crooks, and war veterans.   Graphics   L.A. Noire's graphics are excellent. Even though the game's a few years old by now, it still looks spectacular, and nothing in the game is boring to look at.  All the animations look great and it's worth to note that there haven't been better facial animations in video games after this game.   Sound   From the sound effects to the songs and shows on the car radio as well as the music that's been carefully selected to feel right in different situations, everything in this game sounds just right.   Gameplay   There are gameplay elements that will instantly feel very familiar to those who've played any of Rockstar's games before. But there are also many unique features that this game has to offer.  The game is divided into different cases during which the players are also able to focus on different side quests like dealing with street crimes and finding different cars and landmarks.  Questioning the suspects and other people of the world is done very well. Although, I have to say that on a few occasions, I felt that the right choices were a bit surprising to say the least.   Noteworthy   My playtime of 38 or so hours includes just one playthrough with all the DLC cases included. I also did over half of the street crime missions and unlocked more that a third of the vehicles the game had to offer.  I did come across a few bugs during my playthrough, but they were mostly graphical stuff that disappeared fairly quickly. I also experienced some stuttering every now and again, and the game did freeze two or three times during the almost 40-hour long playthrough. However, I feel that these had little impact to how much I enjoyed the game itself.  The game does require for the player to log in to a Rockstar Social Club account, but it is possible to choose a 'Default' account for which the player doesn't have to provide any personal information and which requires no email verification or the like.",

            "review_text": "DISCLAIMER: IF YOU WISH TO PLAY ON 60FPS, USE WIDESCREENFIXER SINCE THIS GAME IS LOCKED IN 30FPS. FOR FOV, USE FLAWLESS WIDESCREEN AND PRESS EITHER + OR - TO CHANGE THE VIEW. THE PORT FOR THIS GAME ISN'T REALLY THAT GOOD BUT THE GAME ITSELF IS.   LA Noire is an open world detective game set in the 1940s after WWII. You play as a Cole Phelps, a marine turned police officer then detective. You solve cases from traffic to homicide to vice and then arson.   PORT This game was ported by Rockstar Seeds who were known for porting other pc games either developed or published by Rockstar such as GTA 4. Team Bondi developed this game for Xbox 360 and Ps3 and a year later, Rockstar Seeds brought it to PC. Like GTA 4, LA Noire isn't really that a good a port, maybe worst if you ask me. There's no mod support so there's nothing anybody can do fix the issues this game has. The PC controls aren't that well so you need a controller. The framerate is capped at 30fps, unless you use the tool I mentioned above, it's easy to use. However some of the physics in the game will be messed up when playing at 60fps, there are videos on Youtube that shows it. But just cap it back to 30fps for a minute and you'll be fine. Also there are plenty of texture pop-ins everywhere you look especially driving. It's obvious how much they truly cared from this console port.  GRAPHICS As stated there are a ton of texture and assets popping up in the screen but you can handle after a little while. The amount of detail in this game is amazing. As a guy who lives in Los Angeles, I actually recognized a lot of buildings in the game, the amount of work put into the interior, and exterior design of the city is beautiful. As you may know, this game utilizes what's called MotionScan, where the developers used 32 high definition cameras to capture actors faces. While it looks great, less attention I believed was put into the bodies since it was done separately.   STORY You start as a cop, then rise to becoming a detective. The story is told by the cases you solve, however the actual story to the game does start later near the end when you're in vice. You can pick up the pieces to the story by picking up newspapers as you're doing the earlier cases. The dialogue in this game is well written but there were some times when I felt that the actors where overdoing it. Above all, the story is really good and dark since that's what you would expect from the noire type of entertainment.   GAMEPLAY Rockstar may have published this game but it doesn't mean you blast gas stations up with a rocket launcher. To simply put, the gameplay is extremely limiting. You can browse the open world detail of LA Noire but there isn't much to do in this game when not doing the cases. There are mini side quests where help people out but they're really short (Lasts about 1-3 minutes). Interrogation in this game consists of asking a question and wondering if that person's telling a truth or lieing and expose them with evidence, or doubt them if you don't believe them. Like other Rockstar games, there are gunplay but in my honest opinion the gunplay in this game feels like an arcade game. It's not the same as GTA or Red Dead Redemption's gunplay which I think is amazing (Rockstar please bring to PC).  CONCLUSION I believe you will enjoy this game especially when getting the Complete Edition which has every case the game has to offer. I know I haven't said much about your character Cole Phelps but to honest he has no personality at all. You don't know much about him in a personal level.  1.) Port isn't that good (30fps lock) 2.) Environment is really well detailed and amazing 3,) Don't know much about the character you play as.  If on sale, get this game and have fun, it's a long game.",

            "review_text": "This is the best detective game on Steam at the moment. You play as Cole Phelps, a veteran who went into police work in order to keep serving his country and dispense justice. As you play, you say to hell with procedure and take the initiative to solve the crimes the lazy detectives are glossing over. This gets you promoted to become a full-time detective, and you make your way up the hierarchy of crime investigators.  I'm not gonna bother dividing these things into pros and cons. If you need a detective game in your life, buy it.  If you don't, read this review and buy it.   GAMEPLAY: You're not buying the game for this: - This is a third person open world game, yet it has nearly nothing to find or do in terms of free roaming. Between missions you may accept a street crime side mission, but they often boil down into a chase, a car chase or a shoot-out, all of which probably won't get your blood pumping. Do yourself a favour and just follow the story; it's pretty long. - The combat is boring and generic. The weapons bear no real feeling of impact and you can take a lot more bullets than the bad guys. Melee combat is practically unexistant. The combat is merely a way of prolonging the game and supplement the story. - No reward or change if you decide to go for a non-lethal arrest. - The driving is nothing spectacular. It's far less enjoyable than in most Rockstar games in that it's pretty slow and car chases force you into just trying to keep the driver in sight until the game decides that he's arrived at his final destination. Occasionally you will be able to have your partner shoot out the suspect's tires, which feels alright, but you won't be aiming. - Interrogation is a pretty fun mechanic which is probably what this game is known for. You have to read the suspect/victim's facial expressions and pick up on uncertainty or curious claims, then decide if they're lying or telling the truth and reveal more info/clues if you answer correctly. Sometimes you'll be dealing with good liars that the game won't tell you about, who tell you their side of the story very rigidly and confidently, but without the facts adding up. This is to make sure you know have an overview of the case and it's a very nice touch. - Facial features and animations are great, since a fairly thorough facial motion capture method was used for every character and gels very well with the story. As a result, every character in the game looks like the person who performed the voice. - The game is locked to 30 FPS for the facial motion capture to work.  STORY: The reason this game is nothing short of phenomenal: - Between cases, you will sometimes get a clip that goes back to Cole's participation in the war in Japan after the attack on Pearl Harbour. From the very beginning of the game, you'll be seeing these clips/flashbacks and they will play into the story as you progress. The way the game creates parallel story lines that eventually cross into eachother is absolutely fantastic. - The cases are often connected to eachother in some way; I can't say much without spoiling it.  - They're also fairly devoid of plot holes and create a comprehensive and complete experience. - The job eventually expands into your personal life, even though it initially doesn't seem like you even have one. - Characters from the story occassionally appear in the side missions (street) crimes, which is a nice touch but it won't mean or matter much. - The atmosphere is extremely immersive and convincing; when you launch this game, you turn into L.A.'s top detective in a realistic city based on real places with real landmarks.  The music amplifies the detective noir vibe and is probably the final aspect that gets you into the role. Every character wears clothes and sets their hair in a way that is true to the time period as well. - The voice acting is absolutely beautiful and convincing in every aspect. Team Bondi really scratched together some very talented people.  L.A. Noire does what is does very well, and as long as you're willing to look past the FPS cap and just follow the main story line, you will be an experience richer. The interrogation mechanic might get dull after a while; for this I recommend you consider what you'd answer in a situation and then look up the correct answer in a guide to keep you trekking along.",

Absolutely fantastic story and characters; combined with a beautiful map and fun gameplay. It's a very unique game in my opinion; there aren't many like it. I stretched the game out for a long time (almost 6 or 7 months) so when I finished it was almost like I had binge watched a tv show on netflix and it was coming to a close. One of the few games that actually made me emotional at the end. I highly recommend it to anyone who's considering it.

You will not find any other kind of game like LA Noire. The bad points are that the game will repeat clues, and you will notice them.   Ex: * you found a clue... you should check out the Steam Cafe.  *Gabe says he works at the Steam Cafe... you should check it out.  * The Steam Cafe is located near the crime scene... you should go investigate it.  Another problem is when you have to question someone for doubt or lie, you have to somehow bring up a clue that's comepletely off topic.  Ex: Gabe: 'I've been working at the cafe the whole time. My alibi clears me!' You: 'You're lying! You're the culprit!' Gabe: 'prove it!' You: you bring up Half Life 3... 'Why isn't this out yet?!' Gabe: 'Oh! You got me!' *correct answer*  Overall, it's a good game with multiple interesting stories of crime. I completely recommend it if you're interested in solving crimes by finding clues and detecting people are lying.",

Noire is a boredom factory. You push some buttons, you look around, you click through some dialogue and out comes the snores. The game is simple, the action sequences are usually holding the shift button as you jump over fences and short walls and other manners of game props while chasing a bad guy, and the 'puzzle' elements involve looking for one of the many shiny clue objects in a scene (there isn't even any clutter to complicate things, the console effect means that even in supposedly hectic scenes like a recently trashed apartment there are only a few interact-able props, which the main character will almost immediately tell you “isn't relevant to the investigation”) or walking around a room until a piano note sounds, then pressing a button and rotating an object to get the moron detective to look at all 4 sides of a knife before deciding it could be a murder weapon.   No matter what you choose from the dialogue branches, the main character shoots off in whatever direction he fancies, so any immersion into the supposed movie atmosphere of the game is broken every time it prompts you for input because the talking heads have no flow to their discussion.  “Stick with it”, they cry, “the later cases get pretty good!”  Hogwash. It felt like a chore slogging through every single mission, at no point was I having fun. The stories aren't compelling, the gameplay isn't exciting, the puzzles aren't puzzles, and above all the voice acted dialogue sequences are an agony to sit through (not because of the voice acting, which is average at its worst). Pass, pass ten thousand times. I would rather play a real puzzle game, a visual novel, or an action game. L.A. Noire tries to do some mashup of all three and comes out a pile of turds.

The game seemingly started fine, or perhaps I was too enamored with the city to notice, but DX9 or DX11, highest settings or lowest, nothing mattered. The camera would stutter, the engine would slow, and otherwise damage the otherwise breathtaking aesthetics of L.A. Noire.  2) The driver and pedestrian A.I. is atrocious. For a game that forces you to spend the majority of your time driving, expect to laugh at the ridiculous decisions made by the NPCs in this game. Then, when chasing down suspects or trying to avoid... well, I won't spoil anything, but let's just say at certain points, you will yell at the television for these dummies to get out of the way.  3) The action sequences aren't as interesting as the investigation ones. Basic action, such as the street crimes, or even a moderate shootout, aren't too bad but the above complaints tend to ruin any tension Team Bondi attempted to create.  I think that's about it. So what did I like?  1) The city. Sorry, Sleeping Dogs, you've been knocked off the top spot (previously owned by Saints Row 2) for best video game city. It's no wonder Team Bondi went bankrupt after this game. The amount of time and resources it must have taken to recreate Los Angeles is staggering.  2) The characters. Thanks to stellar voice acting and the well-publicized facial animation engine, it's easy to forget you're playing a game and not watching a movie. Tip: Play L.A. Noire in black and white and the effect is even more staggering.  3) The story. I'm a sucker for noir in general, and this is a pretty good tribute to the genre. That pretty much every single element is tied to the main story, no matter how minor it seems, is a nice touch.  4) The investigation. Whether you're screaming at a widower -- er, I mean 'doubting' a widower -- or trying to figure out how a torn letter fits with the case, I enjoyed poking around the city's seedy underbelly and solving the (many!) mysteries.  Note that I keep writing 'the city' instead of 'the game.' Yes, it's that realistic.  I loved L.A. Noire, and if you like mysteries and history at all, please don't hesitate picking up this game. Just be warned that even at 30 FPS, a computer that laughs at the recommended specs of the latest games will (probably) not run this smoothly. Fortunately, you'll probably be too engrossed to care. I know I was.",

            "review_text": "So , I completed this game on 100% and I can finally write a review.  What can this game offer?  Well , in this game you are going to play as a detective Cole Phelps and watch not only how he is going up in his career but also how he is becoming a real hero.  There are 5 desks to complete in this game : Patrol , Traffic , Homicide , Vice and Arson. Each of them contains ~5 cases (only Patrol has 4) and also 1 or 2 DLC cases. Both of default and DLC cases are very interesting. Each desk offers unique cases , for example in Traffic desk you will investigate crimes related with cars stealing and in Homicide you will investigate brutal murders.  To feel like a real detective you'll need to collect evidence at crime scenes and also ask questions to suspects. You'll need to see if they are telling truth or lying and show one evidence to confirm that they are lying. Sometimes it's really hard to tell if person is lying and that's why there are 'Intuition'in this game. You are getting 'Intuition points' while you are leveling up and use these points to see what have other players chosen.This can help a lot.  There are a lot of things to collect in this game from hidden badges to cars. To fully understand plot you can pick up newspapers which you can easily find during main story. There are also flashbacks in the end of some cases. These flashbacks help you to see the past of Cole Phelps.  This game has huge open world(almost a half of GTA V(or even more)). To move around quickly you can ask your partner to drive the car to the selected location. This can save a lot of time.  In conclusion , I can't understand why almost everyone is upset with ending of this game. I think that the ending that we have would be the best option to end the game.  One disadvantage of this game is that it's locked on 30FPS.  So , this game is great , shall i say. It has a great story and spectacular gameplay which will make you play this game even after you have beate it. Although , without DLC cases this game may seem to be short so if you can afford DLC bundle - buy it.  I can proudly give this game 9.5/10 (because I had some problems with it and saw some bugs)",

The game has performed pretty smooth so far and the graphics are good, but the atmosphere and visual depiction of Los Angeles is fantastic! The story line and voice acting is very good and quite absorbing. I've never been a big fan of crime detective adventure mysteries but this game has changed all that...I'm hooked, at least for L.A. Noire. The keyboard (you can customize) and mouse controls take a bit of practice but then it flows quite well. The downside (which is very insignificant) is the auto saves, I'm not a fan of that but in a game like this that is probably the only option. I highly recommend this game, just be sure you have a computer that can handle it...I too give it a 9 out of 10!  Patrick  ",

There aren't many games in which you get to test your brains as well as as your hand-eye coordination in real world scenarios. Playing a detective could never be as much intriguing or fun as it was in L.A. Noire.  The game mechanics are super cool, allowing the player to gauge the characters expressions and body language and based on that, assess whether they're lying, hiding something, or telling the truth. Although the game is fairly linear, it's very interesting to see how the decisions made affect each case. It would have been even more interesting if the entire story changed on the basis of those decisions, of course!   Every gamer should definitely play this once.",

            "review_text": "If you`ve been looking for that gem that lets you play a career on the other side of the GTA fence, then this is certainly the one and not only that, its a masterpiece.  Highly stylized and cinematic this game tips it`s hat to the Hollywood of the 1930 and 1940s taking after films like L.A. Confidential (one of my favorites).  There is so much more to this than a game like GTA in the way of storyline and character interaction that it is beyond comparison. As you`ve probably read on other reviews, pain staking detail was paid to facial animation for this title giving it one of the most realistic in terms of facial rendering allowing you to look for facial and body language to determine whether someone that you`re questioning is lying or not and the subtle nuances of their mood, all of which affect your questioning and your case. Sure there`s shootouts, foot chases, car chases and stakeouts but the real heart of this game lies in the career of your character and his interactions with potential witnesses and crime scene evidence.  Be prepared for an involved commitment or if you`d rather just run around on patrol, you can play with the Free Roam mode. You'll play from four desks: Traffic, Patrol, Homocide and Vice. Each has a series of cases that take you through your character's career which plays out like a classic movie with modern drama and writing. There's top notch voice and motion performance and some of the greatest moments in the game will come from your interactions with the various partners you have at each desk. Highly recommended if you like Rockstar's style and attention to detail. This title shines in its attention to storyline and the details of working in that line of work and of course if you've tired on running with one side of the law in the various virtual worlds out there, this one will give it to you in glorious detail that experience from the other side.  It does require a bit of horsepower to fun smoothly though a fast dual core 2 Ghz with a half decent video card (Geforce 210 w/512Mb) should do sufficiently with the graphics options turned down which still looks great. I'm running at about 3/4 of full graphics and it looks and feels awesome with a machine a fair bit faster than what I've recommended.  For the price this one sells it is a gem for certain. Keep in mind that this title is definitely for a mature audience as you will be solving cases accurately modeled from actual crime scenes. Viewer discretion is definitely advised.  This title really gives you the experience from the other side of the fence to so many other titles out there and its an honest and hard hitting title for certain. A great experience and Rockstar has pulled all the stops to tell this police story.  Highly recommended",

            "review_text": "So I'm kind of missing a middle option in terms of ratings here.  While it's not a espacially good game. It isn't a bad game either. In terms of technical aspects. The graphics are nothing mind blowing by any stretch of the imagination, but they aren't bad either. There's a strict 30fps lock going on, which I couldn't find a quick fix to by googling (such as changing a line in some config file) So I just decided to suck it up and enjoy the 'console experience'.  The gameplay: The investigating comes down to looking long enough for 'clues' and interrogating people afterwards and deciding wether they are a) lying (and you have proof in form of one of the clues you previously collected) b) lying (and you don't have proof, but are in fact just suspecting they are lying) - this option is confusingly labeled 'doubt' c) telling the truth  The rest of the gameplay comes down to some shooter-segments, some car chases. Neither of which are particualarly good.  The Main positive about the game in my opinion is the Story, which I actually found pretty interesting. However the actual plot only develops very slowly during the beginning and middle of the playtime. The story gets more interesting towards the end when the plot thickens.  Another Selling Point is the setting of post WW2 America in the late 40s, which isn't beeing explored in very many games. So If you think this sounds like a interesting setting just because it isn't such common theme in video games, then this might be something for you.  So overall I said I don't recommend this game because there is no middle option, cause that is what this game has written all over it in my opinion. And I reserve the 'I recommend this game' option for games that I think are actually worth recommending, such as the Witcher 3, Tomb Raider(The Reboot), or Bioshock Infinite,... This doesn't mean I think LA:Noire is bad, it's just not as good as those games which I just mentioned in my opinion. And it honestly feels kind of like a ♥♥♥♥-move to click the thumb down-button, because I know that people that don't read the review will just think I thought it was a bad game, when really I don't.",

At first I thought that the crime or chapters of the homicide cases were poorly written because although some of the clues pointed out to the 'person of interest' being the criminal, even though not everything fit into place. After playing through the chapters a few more times, I thought maybe it was just the developer's way of portraying the LAPD in the 1940's and their focus on convicting a suspect instead of actually finding out who did it and delivering justice; justice however is relative to the person dishing it out and the person receiving it. It could also be that all the cases lead up to a true mastermind framing everybody else, so that is something to look forward to. Overall, the gameplay is pretty enjoyable in the sense that it is quite similar to GTA. So if you're a GTA or mystery fan, and you are also interested in playing the role of the cop instead of the role of a robber, I would highly recommend this.",

Each division features 4 to 6 varying cases, which are - some more, some less - tied together. There is also a major backstory that runs like a thread through all divisions and cases.

The main cases are very interesting and carry a lot of suspense and intrigue. The downside of many of these cases is that they may become too easy for some and may not prove to be a good challenge. However, it is important to note that only the chase scenes can be a bit too easy, but actually finding the clues and persons of interests in the right order can prove to be a challenge.

First of all Cole Phelps is just an extremely dulll and unlikeable character. His smug, smarmy facial expressions are captured perfectly with the only real reason to take a glance at this game. The facial animation is still better than most today however the texture quality has not aged well and coupled with the choppy framerate it just doesn't look as good as it once would've.   The story doesn't seem to be going anywhere interesting after more than six hours (I've played an hour or two offline as well), it just seems to be a kind of episodic deal. Crime or two, promotion, another crime or two. If you're into detective stuff and noir style then maybe, just maybe you can get into this as there is kind of a gap in the market for this stuff. Just don't expect much in the way of action.  This game essentially plays itself during any action sequences. You just hold the trigger down and move forward until the other guy stops running. The shooting is very basic, not bad in any real way, there's just nothing to it. There's nothing really noteworthy to say about the driving either.   The meat of the gameplay is the detective stuff. This consists primarily of listening to people talk and using the advanced facial capture stuff to read faces and determine if they're lying, with the help of evidence and context of course. Oh and bad acting works to your advantage too sometimes. You literally just pick Truth, Doubt or Lie which is just doubt but you have to pick a bit of evidence to back it up. You also walk around picking things up and looking at them with great interest. The thing that bugged me the most with this is the fact that it immediately tells you if you got the dialogue tree wrong which just compels me to retry until I get it right and subsequently I end up hearing the same bits of dialogue a dozen times. It'd be more immersive if it just sort of went forward with no specific indication, at least not until the end of the case. For the last one I just used a walkthrough but that made it thrice as boring which is when I realised that I was not enjoying it enough to play anymore.

You will be able to play it at 60 fps if your PC is powerful enough but then uncapping the framerate would mess up one thing. The driving. Driving is one of the key elements of this game and after you have uncapped the framerate, driving physics will be slightly altered. It will be harder to drive around as the vehicle will feel 'floaty' like how the driving in GTA 4 feels like. But if you can get used to that, then there should not be a problem at all.   That would be the only issue in this game so if you can overcome it, you will have a great experience playing it. I would definitely persuade anyone out there to purchase L.A. Noire.",

Even if you do have a computer capable playing Grand Theft Auto IV, you may still suffer very bad gameplay experience because of its limited 30 frames per second refresh rate and some other technical bits about the bad performance of the game...  Since this game is not using Rockstar's Advanced Game Engine but a modified unnamed engine, I guess you may find that some driving aspects and shooting mechanics are slight different in the works from GTA IV...  Workarounds are of course limited and not throughly proven to fix all solutions surrounding the game, example: -str or Single Threading game setting -nonv to disable nVidia 3D stereoscopic view (if you are using AMD or Intel GPU) -npd works by extending the compatibilty of GPUs which are not in their native supported DirectX version. If you have a DirectX 10 GPU but there's no DX10 option, you better choose DirectX 9 renderer and add -npd to the command line  But if you managed to iron out (or even ignored) these NG stuffs, you will really get to experience the game at it's best!

The start of each new chapter gives the feel of a new episode of a crime drama on TV. This is a good fit, as the game is quite a bit like an interactive movie.  The game controls are a bit like Bully (also from Rockstar). Grand Theft Auto controls would have been better, but the game plays perfectly fine with a controller.  The graphics are quite good. The latest and greatest lighting and textures may not be present, but the game does a great job with facial expressions. This is a good thing, as most of the game revolves around your ability as a detective to identify when someone is not telling the truth.  Gameplay has youin the role of a detective. You look for evidence, question suspects and in your 'off time' run down street criminals as sort of little mini missions. The evidence searches are quite easy if you set the controller to vibrate when they are nearby. Without the aid of vibration, it would be very easy to miss a clue without clicking every shred of paper you walk close to. Suspect interviews are a little tougher. You ask a question and get an answer. Then you have to decide on facial expressions (shifting eyes, a smile, looking away...etc. if the suspect if not giving the full story, or if they are flatout lying. If you choose correctly, you are rewarded with more information and some points. Choose wrong, and you will fail to be promoted. There are intuition points you earn that can help to find evidence and determine if someone is lying, but you can burn though these quickly and will need to solve more crimes to refill your suply.  There are fight scenes with guns and fists, and chase scenes in vehicles. If you fail these smaller missions several times in a row, the game shows you merry and allows skipping the mission without penalty.  As I said, the game is very much a story that you are taking part in. Gameplay is not very difficult, and while you can replay missions to do better, the story and cutscenes do not really make for interesting replay value.   I'm enjoying the story, and am intrigued enough to keep going. Overall the game is good. I think the only downside is a low replay value. There is some type of online social component to the game, but I've not been able to connect to it, The game is a few years old, so maybe the servers have been shutdown? ",

He was with me on okinawa, he was never really my friend, but he wasn't really my enemy. I started with small talk about the war back in the day. But he's fed up and said cut the crap. So i started questioning him about the murder. He got no alibi at the time of death. It was a simple question, but a complex answer.  Now the hard part, I have to decide. Is it the truth? Or a doubt? Or maybe a lie. I decided to trust him. And he gave me another lead. I went on with that lead with my partner. It was pretty convincing, so i decided to take him as another suspect and brought him to the station. While searching the place, i found the murder weapon and proceed to interrogate him. He gave an alibi. I chose the lie, and show him the evidence. I charged him, and the DA will do the work next.  I went home, not to the usual place. It was a blue room, i saw an angel singing i always kill. I was tempted. The next morning i went to the office, there's another murder. So i went to the crime scene, expecting a new body. But i was wrong. It's the same mark as before, the murder didn't stop. At that moment i knew that it was him. I went to his place and dragged him back to the station. He insisted that it wasn't him. And i said that's a lie. But it was pretty convincing, so i persuaded him to gave up names. He's a tough guy, he won't gave up his friends. So it must be on our unit back in the army. Just before i went to continue the investigation, the boss called me. There's a picture of me with the germans. My wife left me, and i got demoted. It was my partner, he rat me out.   Then i wondered, who's really the enemy, and who's really the friend? I got caught in the truth and the lie. So i forgot the doubt. Then i doubt the LAPD, i doubt my partner, i doubt my wife, i doubt him. And the most important one, i doubt myself. I said goodbye to the angel. Forever.  Then i went home to play L.A Noire.",

            "review_text": "Now that I have 100%'d this game I can write a review :  This is the best detective game I played so far ( and my veri first one ). It introduces you to Los Angeles back in 1947, with a very good off-case story and behind the scenes ( flashbacks ). Some cases are really short and most of them are a bit longer, wich is great. Homicide desk is the trickiest chapter of all the game. The atmosphere feels great but weird camera angles. Very unpredictable cases, unpredicatble endings as well. The story isn't linnear, wich is the biggest detail on a game IMO. And If you're tired on doing cases, you can do street crime cases, wich are fun ( the only thing that bothered me was driving all across Los Angeles )  Unlike some R* games, the hole map is 'unlocked' at the very first chapter of the game, wich is nice seeing as GTA Series got their map locked at startup ( except Gta 5 ).  Pros : - You will laugh your butt off listening to your partner when you crash into something or run over someone. -Non-linnear story. -Extremely confusing sometimes, making you think really hard ( Homicide desk is he best example ). -♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ partners. -Dlc is worth buying, It adds 6 cases I believe. -You're solving a street crime case, ok? You're interrogating a suspect and out of nowhere Cole asks the Suspects : 'Do you ♥♥♥♥ boys?' - Definitely the best question in the game.  Cons : -This game has catch-up locked, wich makes it really easy to NOT fail a stage of the mission if your suspect is getting away. -The achievement 'Auto Fanatic' is the most tedious of all. 95 different vehicles and you have to drive them all at least once, and to make things worse, remember you're in 1940's and almost all cars look the same. - **MINOR Spoiler Alert** - Ok, let's talk about the ending... here's where R* did things horribly wrong, the game shouldn't have ended that way and I was extremely annoyed about that. Some people said they liked it, I personally HATED it. Definitely they should have gone for a different one.  Overall, very good game, give it a try. I loved every second of it but not the ending tho...",

The recreation of LA is glorious, the cars, the facial animation, the characters, this game has all the chops of a great detective game. It was just the story. While I loved Cole Phelps as a characters, he made some choices that made you facepalm, 'COME ON COLE!'. Once you get through the story, free roam mode is sweet as you get to find famous locations and collect things, I actually had way too much fun with this game.  You are Cole Phelps, a rookie cop with the LAPD in the late 1940's. While playing as Cole, you will get to learn about his past in the war, rise through the ranks, become a public hero and chase down the Black Dahlia killer. LA Noire is not your standard open world action game as it is certainly more than that. It's more like an adventure detective game where you use a gun every now and then. More later in the game while working Vice than during your time with Homicide.  Very fun, but I probably would have made different choices later on in the story. 8.9/10",

And, if you wanted to take a break from the story, you can drive around town responding to 'normal' police calls such as bank robberies, things that aren't detective work, you can also search for rare cars and learn more about the landmarks of Los Angeles in the 1940/50's.  The mechanics (Questioning, clue finding):  I must say the questioning part of this game is very fun, and the achievement for 100% correct answers is very difficult without a guide, I almost had it and near to the end I screwed up a question and it's safe to say I wasn't very happy at all with myself.  The clue finding is fun as well, in some cases it's a bit boring, but with most cases I've found that there's difficulty finding some clues but once you've played the game through at least once, you can remember some of the spots where clues are left.  The length: A perfect size in my opinion, it's lengthy but not so lengthy it's ridiculous.

The gun action was also basic and easy to understand , from taking cover to blind firing your ememies or even just straight ramboing it.  Taking the vehicles back to 1940's was a very neat idea, driving old cars was fun for a change wrather than the ones in the GTA series. They are over 90 vehicles and I only found half of them.  The map is huge and there's just so much to explore.  The main factor of the game is the motion capture of the face, the facial expressions were probably the most detailed and realistic I've ever seen in a game.

The main feature you've probably heard about is the interview system, decide from truth, doubt or lie when questionning witnesses or suspects, the results of those decisions changing the case and Cole Phelps' career.  Go from beat cop to traffic detective, up through homicde and into the dangerous world of arson and vice, clean the streets whilst driving carefully (if thats even possibly in a rockstar game) to crimescenes and sweep areas to find evidence that could crack the case wide open.  The game doesnt just allow you to interview suspects and search through trashcans, you will definitely get into a few brawls and gunfights along the way, whether you be tackling the mob, or just stopping a robbery, you wont feel the need for more excitement in Rockstars L.A. Noire.",

This same set up (with an r9 380 GPU) runs games like Shadow of Mordor at a rock solid 60 fps+. Yet LA Noire - from 2011 no less - still runs like a slideshow. Specifically, any situation where you can see more than 4 feet from your character drops the frame rate down into the teens or low 20s, making movement jerky and the visuals distracting and unpleasant. Unfortunately very little of the gameplay takes place in phone boxes or toilet cubicles, meaning that most of the game runs badly.  This, along with Episodes from Liberty City, marked the low point in Rockstar's dismissive treatment of PC gaming. It is obviously a problem with incredibly shoddy coding in the PC port - do a web search for 'LA Noire framerate issues' or similar to see thousands of others just like me. It's never a good sign when there are dozens of potential hacks or command line tricks available to try to get a game to work properly. Oddly, you will also find people with inferior systems having no problems, confirming that the game is not demanding, just badly written.  There's probably a great game in here somewhere. But if you buy this, you're risking horrible, game breaking performance problems.",

If you watch a 'making of' video, then you'll see the incredible tech they put in place to capture actors face reactions and performances as part of the characters in the game. This makes the game highly immersive and helps to deliver many interesting stories (crime cases).  In some ways, sovling crimes is like playing an interactive story more than a game. However, I found it a really enjoyable and entertaining experiece! You do feel involved and in control, so it's not a QTE experience.  The game does borrow heavily from the Grand Theft Auto style of open world play. I was not a big fan of this style of open world play. You can discover mini-cases or bust robberies in progress as you drive around the city, but none of these are very compelling or story driven. Thankfully, this part of the game is completely optional. In fact, even driving is optional as you can have your partner drive you straight to the scene of the crime!

As you attempt to solve murder, narcotics and various other cases, the game requires you to critically think as you progress through each case. Each investigation requires you to inverview possible suspects and decide whether they are telling the truth or lying. At the same time, there are numerous instances where gun play is an important part of the game as well.

Shocklingly enough, the game runs smoothly on my machine with absolutely no issues, whatsoever. Perhaps the people having problems have older machines or out of date drivers. I didn't need to mess with the command line or anything to get it to work. These issues could have been resolved through patches.  - Game is fun to play, even though it gets a tad bit repetitive.   - Facial features are AMAZING. Even better than today's games. This game has aged well.  - Smooth animations and transitions; chases are seemless.  - Has the best voice acting I've ever heard in a video game.  - Excellent graphical fidelity and sound.  - It has a black and white option where it applies a filter to make it look like you're watching an old movie. It's actually pretty cool, even though I'd never use it, so it's a wasted feature for me... but it's there.  - Menu is intuitive and easy to use. All appropriate features are there, including the option of turning off mouse acceleration, which is always nice, as it puts off a lot of people.  - Consumer-friendly price for content: I got this game for under $9 a while back including all of the DLC.  - I'm not sure how historically accurate the controls for the cars are, but vehicle controls are decent and driving doesn't feel frustrating.  - Character movement is authentic/realistic.  - The game allows you to fast travel ANYWHERE via your partner.  - There are 7 things to do in this game: 1) Do the main missions. 2) Do the short side missions that pop up when you're on your way to the main mission. 3) Collecting cars (95 total). 4) There are many landmarks scattered throughout the city that you can find. As you are driving through the city and pass by a landmark, it gives you the option of pressing a button to record it. That's it. 5) There are various newspapers (13 total) found throughout the city. You can only collect these during the main missions. It is not possible to collect them in free roam, which is kinda dumb. 6) Finding hidden badges. 7) Finding film reels.  ********** CONS: **********  - No manual save. I'm used to games providing both or just manual. Having only auto saves makes it so you can't start the game where you'd normally like. I like to reload saves to do things I normally wouldn't do.  - Cutscenes aren't skippable. Meaning if you mess up a few times, you need to rewatch them.   - The game is fullscreen while cutscenes are widescreen. I get that the devs were trying to give the game a movie-like feel to it, but it ends up being distracting/annoying and odd.  - Intros (starting up the game) are not skippable so you have to wait a minute or so for the game to load (game's file system is not standard so I couldn't find the intros to rename them to make them not appear. Google was not helpful). This might seem like a minor issue, but it is greatly annoying, especially including the time it takes for the game to unneccessarily check for DLC content, which it shouldn't check for in each session.  - Even though it's an open world game, it does not feel like it because there aren't any reasons to explore the city. If you are driving towards a mission marker, you'll ocassionally get these 'crime in progress' missions (can choose to accept/deny) where you stop what you're doing to drive over to apprehend/kill criminals. These are nice and varied, but they aren't enough to help carry the game (not that long, usually 2-3 minutes) outside of the primary missions.  - This is more of an interactive movie than an actual detective game. I felt like I was just being led from point A to point B. A few cases require you to use your brain, but the game is pretty straightforward, otherwise.  - The world doesn't feel alive. NPCs have the same facial and aesthetic quality as the main characters, but they don't do anything unique in the environment. If you bump into them, they'll say things, but their mouths don't move. The most interaction you'll get from them is if you run into another NPC's car. It's cool because they'll do the whole ragdoll animation and look injured.  - You will encounter chase sequences of various kinds. I just wish that the chases on foot were better. For example, if I'm chasing someone with a gun, I would like to shoot them in the leg to incapacitate and arrest them. You can fire warning shots, but sometimes it doesn't work so you'd think it'd make sense to shoot their foot. But if you do this, the criminal dies, which is dumb.  - This game needs a difficulty setting. You can tinker around in the settings to turn off hints and such, but certain aspects like the combat aren't challenging at all. You get infinite ammo, enemies can't aim, and your character can soak up an outrageous amount of bullets. Granted, the emphasis on a game like this shouldn't be on combat, but considering there are a lot of combat-type sequences, it gets frustrating to the point where these sequences become pointless.  - Double DRM (Rockstar Social Club + Steam). Seriously? At least it's better than GTA IV's triple DRM. Rockstar claims that the game can run by turning Steam off, but the game wouldn't launch when I did that. Most of people's launch problems are from these DRM related issues. Just be glad you don't have to deal with GFWL, in addition.   - For me, it's not fun to drive, which sucks because driving is an important aspect of this game. The novelty of driving through 1940s L.A. wears off fairly quickly. Luckily, Rockstar anticipated this and included a fast travel option for your partner to drive you to your location. But when you do that, there's not too much left in the game, as you'll be blazing through the campaign in no time.  - The game is not challenging. You can completely fail every case and you'll still progress and get the same ending to the game. The lack of branching based on progression (like Mass Effect) is very disappointing and further diminishes replay value.  - I didn't enjoy a lot of the side activites (street crimes were good). Most of these feel like padding, to be quite honest.  - Lack of mission variety. Pretty much every case is solved the same way. The mission where you are tracking down the serial killer is INCREDIBLE and had me hooked because it was something different and fresh. It's easily the best mission in the game. The game started getting good after the the 7-8 hour mark.  - This is one of those games that I don't see myself ever replaying. What would be the point? You already know who's guilty and who isn't. It would be like retaking an exam when you already know all of the answers. When you replay the missions, you already know how characters/suspects are going to behave. You could try to get a better rating, but that's not something I'd want to do.  ********** SHOULD YOU BUY IT?: **********  While production value and graphical quality are tremendous, they shouldn't decide whether a game is worth playing/owning or not, but there really isn't a lot to do to extend the life of this game. Yeah, you can argue that it has a lot of outside activities, but I would argue that collectibles don't count, as I consider them to be annoying padding. There's no multiplayer and, as far as I know, no plans for additional DLC. The campaign is fun, but not one I'd play again and the side missions aren't interesting, aside from a few street crimes you encounter, but those can be finished rather quickly.   With everything that I said, I still would recommend buying the game with all the DLC on a sale, rather than the vanilla game, itself. Despite all the negative things I had to say, there's no denying the fun that I had. Go and get it! ",

It amounts to a bunch of issues that should have been resolved with a few decent beta-testers, but it seems the developers simply pushed it to get to the PC too fast.   The game is sometimes unclear on how to succeed: in interrogations, the subject gives a statement that cannot be true or false, so asking whether he's lying or not is aggravating.   Otherwise, though, the cases are well written and engaging. The story moves well. The environment is fantastically realized, especially the cars and the radio entertainment.

The atmosphere is superb, the dialoge and feeling unpecedented in games like these, it just feels right... On the downside is the Mafia 1 problem that the city of L.A. just feels bland and lifeless, like a sleepy village with a highway running through it and the motioncapture used for the facial animations sometimes looks pretty awkward, as the actors have to overact for the system to pick up their expressions^^  So overall this is a one of a kind, overlooked masterpiece that deserves way more credit...all the more reason to hate this ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bogged and all washed up port!!!  9/10 for the game 1/10 for the pc port  way to ♥♥♥♥ all over your gem rockstar!!",

Set in a gloriously convincing depiction of Los Angeles in 1947 (which is much more attractive than today's LA), it casts you as Cole Phelps, returning war hero turned cop. Instantly, you plunge deeply and satisfyingly into his working life, solving a vast number of cases as he becomes the LAPD's poster-boy, first in Homicide, then in Vice. And your immersion in Phelps' affairs ratchets up even further when he is hung out to dry by his dubious superiors. There have been plenty of games with cinematic pretensions in the past, so what is it that enables LA Noire to make a transcendental leap? Inevitably, technology is involved: the new MotionScan system used to capture actors' performances simply produces more convincing facial animation than we have ever seen in a game.",

The cars were beautiful (even taking into account the anachronistic years and the break lights, which are justifiable from a gameplay stand point) and fun to drive. The game has good graphics for when it was made as well, for those of you who like that, and the game is more than your average shoot 'em up. If you like games with a lot of action, I wouldn't recommend this to you, as shootouts are not as common as GTA or Half-Life, but if you like a game with an enriching story that has a bittersweet/depressing end, then this game is for you.",

I have recently purchased it on Steam and it was a nice trip. Now I'm going to say this, the game is underated to me but I can totally see why people do not enjoy it as much as I did. It's a simple, yet complicated game. It's your standard Rockstar game at its core (open world, shoot, explore, nice story) but not your standard Rockstar game at the same time. First of all, not really open world. You do not get to explore the world whithout any kind of restriction because you're always on a case or mission. You could start a mission, forget it and just explore L.A , but to say the truth, it isn't that interesting compared to other open world games. It's a third person shooter, but you don't shoot a lot in the game since you are a Policeman, but when you do, it's fun yet way too easy (only need 1 bullet to the head and BAM!). The game, did not age that well, but the facial animation still impress me and all. The story of the game is very good I find, but really feels rushed towards the end (♥♥♥♥ ending). What really makes the game shine to me is the way you do interagations. You are a cop, you try to solve murders or crimes, you need clues and you will interogate possible suspects. The interagation is simple, by looking at someones facial animation or tone of the voice, you decide if someone is telling the truth, lying (backing up with clues you find during the case) or if you doubt (which is lying but that you don't have any proof to back it up). The second thing I like about the game are the characters. No, I do not like Cole Phelps (main character), he's an angry prick and I don't find him interesting. But all your partners you have in the game to help you are all very interesting and different. Also the game has a really good sountrack IMO.   In the end, the game doesn't feel that open world, a little easy on the combat side, a really good story (gets bad towards the end :( ), amazing facial animation and great characters. I give this game a 8/10",

            "review_text": "This is a great game! The story, cases, and the world are interesting enough to keep you playing.  Story  LA Noire is divided up into different desks. You can think of them like seasons in a TV show because that is what they felt like to me. There is Patrol (tutorial), Traffic, Homicide, Ad Vice, and Arson. Minus Traffic and Patrol each one of them have cases that all connect to form a bigger story. I can't really describe it without spoiling anything. In all of these cases you play as Cole Phelps, a marine who came back from WWII with a big award for bravery. You get these flashbacks of his war days that seem pointless at first but as I mentioned individual cases combine to form a bigger story as do these flashbacks. You also have partners who are all very interesting characters. You wonder why some of them even became police officers when they do and say certain things.  Gameplay  The gameplay is the same for almost all the cases. You go around the city following leads, collect evidence, and interview people. The evidence is necessary to catch people in lies. If you think a person is lying you can either doubt (call them out without evidence) or lie (call them out and present evidence to back it up). It's confusing at first you get used to it. Evidence is always written in your notepad so it's easy to remember which evidence you need most of the time. There is a problem with this system though. Sometimes the right answer is to call the person out on a lie and then ask a different question (that they lie to) and then present evidence on that. For example in one case you ask a guy if he knows the whereabouts of a certain person. He says no. You have to say he is lying and then Phelps will ask if he has commited any burglaries (unrelated to the 1st question) then present evidence that he has committed multiple burglaries. If doubt was not one of the answers this game would be a bit easier but Intuition Points help. Intutiion Points allow you to remove an answer or ask the community on what they pick (kind of like lifelines) or show all clues in the area. you can only ask the community if you join Rockstar Social Club though. If you achieve maximum rank (you level up by completing street crimes, interviews, finding landmarks) then you get 5 intuition points to use each case.  Setting  The setting is in 1940s Los Angeles. This is before it got really famous I think. You can listen to old music from the 40s and some radio shows sometimes (sitcoms on the radio) like 'The Bickersons'. The cars look cool too and do not blow up if you do alot of damage to them unlike other Rockstar games. The world has landmarks for you to find (like RKO theatre), there is an achievement for driving one of every single car including cool rare ones like the Ford H-boy and lame ones like an Ambulance car and a giant pickup There also badges and movie reels to collect but those don't seeem to do anything other than be an achievment. Newspapers also give you a movie clip that relates to the story. Most of them have a major antagonist that you won't come across till later on in the game.  Graphics  A big con about the game is that it's not a a very good port. It's better than GTA IV but still not quite up to speed. There is a 30 FPS cap. On an AMD R7 250 it will run at 30 FPS with everything on Performcance and 2x Anti-aliasing. If you think I just have a crappy PC I should let you know I also have a multicore processor and it has a better framerate when you swtich to single threading rather than multithreading. So ovbiously they messed up. But you can look past it cause most of the time the framerate is constant.  This is a pretty fun game and you don't have to worry about people calling you to hang out, go out on dates, drive them somewhere, etc. The main gameplay and story are fun enough to keep you playing to the end. Alot of people say that the ending was bad but what did you expect, happy rainbows and dancing flowers?  Also   Courtney Sheldon is a NEEEEEEEEERD!  ",

At times the correct choices seemed a bit far-fetched or inconsistent, even if you were very careful. Maybe the developer pushed this gameplay mechanic a bit too hard in an atempt to keep the difficulty high enough. This prevented me from enjoying an excellent game as much as I should have. The combat also feels out of place (when gunning down hordes of nameless bad guys like in GTA) in a mature game. Flaws aside, this is still a milestone and an example of video games slowly growing up. The open world city is also amazingly authentic, arguably better (and certainly larger) than Liberty City in GTA 4. Porting from consoles was done acceptably well - you get HD textures and enough options, but there is a console checkpoint save system, 30-fps lock and a little mouse lag. Sadly Rockstar Social Club is mandatory.",

And the fact that the game attempts to capture human emotion is super cool.  Did I mention that the music is great, and the art concept (capturing post-WWII LA) is amazing and intensely detailed? And the cinematics are well-done and actually very interesting; the game is kind of like an interactive movie, in a good way. The only thing missing is the musty smell of old houses from the late '40s.  But then L.A. Noire goes off the rails. It's shockingly buggy; the game stutters, for no reason, even in interrigation sequences. The actual graphics quality isn't very good, despite the design and art direction being wonderful.  Even worse, they have totally banal car chase and gunfight scenes that get old, and ruin the well-executed plot. And just because the game is made by Rockstar, why did they need to copy the GTA universe, and try to make you drive everywhere? Plus, for all your decisions as a detective, you have no agency in the outcome of the game. The same thing happens no matter what choices you make. Then, the cherry on top, they try very hard to convince you to sign up and login to their stupid online social club.  Despite all of this, L. A. Noire is still a wonderful idea. I love the idea of an atmospheric detective game. It's worth it for that. But boy-oh-boy do I hope someone makes a newer, improved, L. A. Noire 2. ",

While driving, combat, and free-roaming are not as good as in the Grand Theft Auto games, the story is excellent, the expansive 1940s Los Angeles setting is very well made, and the extremely detailed proprietary MotionScan capture technology allows you to analyze the faces of suspects during interviews to determine whether they are telling the truth.

Playing at 800x600 with all settings scaled down produced an average of 19 FPS.  Even so, I got through the half of the game, hoping that at least the story would be OK. That's when I quit. Not because the story (it was OK and probably will continue to be troughout the rest of the game), but because of the way the interviewing works. Actually, how it does not work with a common sense, and most of the time you're left on guessing or spending intuition points because there is no clear way of knowing what the right choice is.  Too many questions with no clear answers, it made me want to just click through the answers without even thinking just to progress the story. But low, almost unplayable framerate combined with interviewing nonsense - I had to let it go.  Following is a simple example of a badly constructed intervieweing and one that made me give up on the game.  *** SPOILER ALERT ***  So I'm interviewing Miss Candy WhateverHerLastNameIs and the first question I've got right.  The second one is whether she knows about the names of certain bookmakers. Her boyfriend knows about them, the man laying on the floor knows about them, but there is no way to know if she does, no evidence points to her exactly. So I go for Doubt and of course, that's wrong because the fact that her boyfriend had a paper with their names in his locker should've made me sure that she's involved.  Next, I ask her whether she knows about boyfriend's whereabouts, she said she doesn't. Now I have a bus ticket and a picture of a boat as evidence, so not wanting to fail again, I'm guessing she's going to meet him were the bus ticket leads her (because he's on the run). I say she's lying, put out the evidence and it's fail again.",

The investigations are interspersed with 'action scenes' that range from car chases to shootouts and fist fights. I think some people may be turned off by this game if they assume that it plays like Rockstar's flagship Grand Theft Auto franchise - it might use a similar engine but LA Noire is definitely a different animal than GTA.

            "review_text": "L.A. Noire is a noir detective action adventure video game developed by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games released as a Microsoft Windows port on 8 November 2011. It is set in Los Angeles in 1947 and tells the story of a LAPD officer solving a range of cases across five divisions.  This game draws heavily from both the plot and aesthetic elements of film noir which are stylistic films made popular in the 1940s and 1950s. Because this is a game about 1940s detective work, it doesn't shy away from adult themes such as gruesome multilations on a full frontal nudity victim, racial bigotry, paedophillia and even necrophillia. Definitely not a suitable game for the young.  Graphics wise, I am most impressed with the character face renderings which till this date (2015), no other game I have seen comes close to replicating how realistic the faces are. That said, while the faces were realistic, their body animations look rather stiff and it can look quite jarring at times.  Gameplay wise, while there is an open-world of Los Angeles for you to explore, there really isn't any point in doing so other then solving minor crimes and finding several point of interests which contributes to an achievement score. The game even allows you to completely skip driving to locations if you so wish. With a total game time of about 25 hours, it is spread over a total of 26 cases and they are all played out in a very linear fashion, not unlike a graphic adventure game.   To break down the gameplay at its basics, almost every case is basically   1) Go to Location. 2) Look for a bunch of clues. 3) Question some people.  And thats it. There are sometimes action sequences and gunfights inserted along the way to break the cycle. But thats basically it. Rinse and repeat until every case is solved. I actually recommend following a walkthrough to get the correct answers when questioning people so there is a nice flow to the story with no disruptions.  Overall Rating: 8.0 / 10 Well worth playing for its story and character development despite its very linear approach at storytelling. Don't go into this game expecting it to be a Grand Theft Auto or Mafia clone. Definitely well worth a purchase when on a sale.",

It's a unique experience I've never really had in a game like it before or since. It's a detective game in every sense of the word. You get a case, you find clues, interrogate witnesses, deduce the culprit, arrest the culprit, and then go out for donuts. There's chase scenes and shooting sections for the more action-y crowd but these sections have the option to be skipped which is great for people who aren't really good at those or just hate doing them. There are detective games with crimes to solve but none have the depth of L. A. Noire as far as quantity, quality, and continuity between cases.  Each mission takes less than an hour to start and solve depending on how determined you are to find every clue so no case will have you stuck forever. There's also the option to just drive around and solve street crimes for you more free-roaming mission grabbing junkies. There is no failure for messing up an interrogation because there will always be a way that leads to the right convition so you don't have to look up walk-throughs for exactly what to say and find unless of course you want a perfect score.  The real satisfaction comes the very first time you nail an interrogation on the first try and slap someone behind bars. Your boss tell you 'good work Phelps' and your partner says 'nice job rookie' but it feels like they are saying it to you and you feel like you accomplished something on your own. One case down, 41 to go.",

            "review_text": "LA Noire is a strange game, in that it is a combination of 4 action games (car chase, foot chase, fist fight, gun fight) and an adventure-y detective game that is focused around interrogations. Since all these elements are woven around the same story, it really works, at first. After about five or six cases, it loses its luster somewhat. The foot chases, gun fights, and fist fights are too easy. The car chases are easy too as long as you remap your keyboard so that you are driving with two hands. The interrogations are HARD. Even if I read all your evidence carefully, and review your conversation log, and look carefully at the expressions of the suspect, I still get the answer wrong almost half the time. When you get an answer wrong, you often miss out on evidence that is necessary for later interrogations. So once you start bad, things just go downhill. The case always 'solves itself' at the end no matter how bad you screw up the interrogations, and it does this in a very confusing way. It is very frustrating because you can tell you have missed out on half the story. I have replayed some of the cases using a walkthrough, and found out there were big chunks of the story that I completely missed because I botched the interrogations. I replayed a few cases hoping that I could learn to do better on the interrogations, but it hasn't helped yet. The concept of the detective part of the game is very cool, but in the end too difficult and frustrating. The action part of the game is a little too easy and a little too repetitive. The graphics are very good, the facial detail, the period music and details are great, clearly a AAA game in terms of production values. It seems like this game went straight from concept to game, without any play-testing to calibrate the gameplay to a level where it is challenging but still fun.",

This game drags on like a re-run of the hit 1950s show Dragnet, starring Jack Web, but without the fun breaks found in commercials. The player directs, and I don't mean anything by the term, a tough but fair cop through a simple set of investigations which eventually end in a car chase, a shoot out, or a beat down. You might win or lose any of these, but it doesn't really matter. The point is to wade through countless sidebars and cutscenes until all of the boxes are checked and you get a new suit. Pretty much all there is in L.A. Snore is a bad map of Los Angeles, some fairly poor car choices, and traffic and pedestrians that repeat endlessly and do not add to the story at all, and a hard-nosed dead-pan straighter that straight WASP cop who is not likable in the least. I suggest you think carefully about buying this and then don't anyway, it will be more fun.  I paid $7.49 for this waste of time and money.  Pluses: It seemed to work occasionally. Negatives: It seemed to work occasionally. Took several minutes to load, when it loaded at all. Had a lot of cut scenes which gave a back story to a character who I already know too much about.

However dont go into this game expecting GTA as a cop the game is segmented into individual cases and desks. Plus there isnt exactly a ton to do on the side except collect hidden items or solve 40 random minor crimes that take anywhere from 1-5 minutes. On top of that the game is much heavier on the investigation then gunplay and the gun fights only take up about 15-25% of the game. My biggest disappointment was the story however i enjoyed it till about half way through when they threw in an annoying twist which annoyed the heck out of me. The ending is also somewhat weak in my opinion and feels like it was forced due to time limitations :P. Overall I feel it was well worth the $25 i spent for it though.",

As always, there are things that can be improved, but this did not diminish my enjoyment and suspense. You play a rookie cop that moves along the ranks and various divisions of the police force, as you begin to solve (perfectly and sometimes not so perfectly) crimes of varying degrees. The music adds suspense, tension and lends atmosphere to dramatic scenes. There is a certain realistic feel to the characters and animation, as well as the layout of the game. The controls for the most part are simple and easy to learn. The use of an accessible notebook adds flavour and is really helpful in remembering clues. The puzzles range from easy to pay-close-attention, but generally don't distract from the flow of the story. Depending on your system, the graphics are decent and flow well. My wow-factor is in the facial contorsions and mannerisms, which capture the moods of characters quite well. It is unfortunate that a sequel or a continuation of the genre won't be possible, given that the studio that started this is, as far as I know, now gone, but I recommend this game to those who enjoy noir detective films and books. It still has the feeling of a game, not a novel, but in this one you get to take part and your actions will have consequences. I will certainly recommend it if it is on sale and it should make a nice gift if your intended victim enjoys games with detective storylines.",

            "review_text": "Simply put, LA Noire is a steaming pile.  Somewhere along the way developing the impressive technology, art direction and amazing facial animation, LA Noire forgot that first and foremost, a game must be fun to play.   The one thing that I absolutely can not stand about the game is the sluggish controls. Even when walking around as Phelps, I feel like I'm driving a tank. Attempting to finesse my avatar to examine a piece of evidence in a crime scene is an exercise in frustration. When not driving the tank that is my character, I'm driving around in cars that feel just as unresponsive, except that I'm required to chase another vehicle in crowded streets. The only section worse than the driving and investigating is surely the shooting. The developers must have known these sections were terrible, because after you fail a number of times, you are given to option to skip the action sequence.   LA Noire is not without some redeeming qualities. The crime scene investigation (when you're not fighting the controls) is very interesting and the interrogations are definitely the golden nuggets amongst the pile of dirt.   However, this concept sounds familiar... Isn't there another game with these fantastic game mechanics, except without the cumbersome mess of action sequences? That's right, it's called Pheonix Wright: Ace Attorney.  If you're looking for crime scene investigation and perp busting action, look no further than Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney!  On a side note, my heart goes out the to development team that produced the amazing art and technology for LA Noire. It must be devastating to work so hard on a title only to have it crippled by terrible game design and then losing your job because the management of Rockstar Bondi is as incompetent as the design decisions.  Worst game I played in 2012.",

It is a really long game and the entire charm and unique-ness of the game wears off a few hours in. Personally, I find myself too stupid to be able to solve some of the later cases and it didn't help that by that point I just wanted the game to end. The game, at least for me, got rather dull about 15 hours in which is roughly around the 1/3 - halfway point in the game. The only reason I carried on with the game was because I heard that the story towards the end start's getting really good. But 10 hours later I was more bored than I could be and I just decided I couldn't be bothered to finish it. So I watched the ending on YouTube.   The game is pretty much a detective game where you have to walk around crime scenes to find clues and then interview people for information. On the interviews you have to ask questions and then you get the choice to say whether they are telling the truth, to doubt what they are saying or to show evidence (from the clues you found at the crime scenes) that they are lying. You determine whether they are telling the truth or not by how they react. The game used clever face scanning technology to scan people's faces and movements so they look realistic which, while cool, does look a little strange, isn't the best quality and also is the reason the game is locked to 30fps on the PC with no simple way to unlock it. Also, for someone who suffer's from minor autism, I personally have a hard time reading the people's faces to tell whether they are lying or not! You also have shooting and driving sections, but these are rather generic and get dull fast. The shooting sections are fun but are always really short and thankfully the driving sections can be skippable (hold down the button you use to enter the car and your partner will drive instead of you).   The game is fun at first. The first few levels in the game are great fun and you feel very clever. However the game starts to get rather confusing and difficult towards the end and the games charm does slowly start to fade so I never finished the game. However I bought the game on sale and I have enjoyed my time with it. However I never finished it and I am done with it. But I don't feel like I was ripped off so I still reccomend the game.  P.S. The PC port is not that great. The game is locked to 30fps due to the face animation technology used in the game. the graphics are a little dated and there is a lot of pop up. However, if you play the game just for the actual detective parts and don't really care about the shooting or driving sections (which thankfully are skippable if you fail them a few times) then this shouldn't really bother you. However it is something to keep in mind.",

I have played through this game 3 times (on the 360) and saw that the Complete Edition was cheap on PC and had to buy it. The extra cases are very good.  The PC version is decent enough. I use a Widescreen fixer so that the game is forced to play in 60fps instead of 30fps as the 30fps caused motion sickness for me. I reckon they should have had more graphical options but really, when your immersed in the story trying to crack a case... you really don't notice the graphical quality.  I enjoy using a 360 controller as the keyboard and mouse just feels unresponsive and if you want that vibration feature whilst looking at clues then you'll need one. It was what drove me into buying a wired controller and a wireless reciever thingy for my 2 wireless controllers. It improves the gameplay by 150%.  I don't really know what else to say. The game is impressive, the cases are great, you can get very immersed in the world and sometimes I end up empathising with a lot of the characters because the emotions on the models faces are just so well done. When I see a victim crying it does make me feel for them and when some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gives me a smug look during an interview I want strangle them.

There's also optional emergency calls that come through where you can go stop some petty criminal in action. The interviews were really my favorite part; trying to pick the right interrogation technique, when to mention certain pieces of evidence and so on, was fun to do.  There were some less awesome parts of the game. They designed this huge city for you to drive around in, but you can't enter ANY of the buildings except the police stations and whatever building is active for your current quest. It kind of left me feeling cold and disconnected from the city - I couldn't just wander around in and out of shops and houses.   Also (SPOILER ALERT!!!) you end up finishing the game as a completely different character. It was frankly a little odd. I got very attached to the main character, then 2/3 of the way through, you start playing as someone else - who was, throughout most of the game, kind of an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that you worked against. Having to suddenly play as him really annoyed me.   But even so, I still consider this a fun game worth at least one playthrough.",

Indeed it is underrated in Rockstar's inventory of great games (Max Payne, GTA, Red Dead, etc.), but stunning at every angle. It's a pleasing switch from the action packed FPS's, enormous free roam RPG's, and 3rd person adventure. The game is very realistic in people's reactions, attitudes, and apparel. The gameplay is rather smooth and enveloping, sucking you in to figure out who has killed this man, and why. The graphics are above average for the time it was made, from the poignant facial structure, enamoring city of L.A., to the fine scratches upon personal items. The interrogations are vexing and require a lot of thought, especially during the 2nd half of the game. All around, great game, even the second time through. Recommend",

The graphics on this game are one of a kind, using special effects to map the characters faces to look like actual faces and you may even recognize some faces from well known TV actors. This game is set in the late 40's and it a city where you will shoot down criminals, get involved in mob wars, and you'll never find a woman that wears her hair down...for some reason...like ever...it's wierd...literally every woman you meet will have her hair up in a bun...  This game is one of a kind, a classic brought on by Rockstar games. Usually known for their GTA series where you play the criminal causing chaos in the underground they have changed things up with this game where you play the law, and you will feel the pressure as you hunt down murderers and drug dealers. It is vital that you find the clues and squeeze information out of suspects during interviews or you may not solve the case at all which changes the overall direction of the game.   I definitley recommend getting this game, it is a great story and great gameplay.   Overall I give this game 9 out of 10 Toast for Twenty's.",

Go to A, collect evidence, go to B, question eyewitness, go to C, chase suspect.  The main meatyness of the game is the interrogation scenes in which you go though a list of questions and listen to the reply's in which case you can say that the suspect/eyewitness is telling the truth, lying or unsure. Get it correct and the mission is made a bit easer for you, get it wrong and you might find the mission a bit more difficult.

Graphics are great and used in great way in gameplay. Audio is as good as it can be. It took me about 30 hours to complete game with dlcs but without a lot of side missions and discovering city. So there is at least about 35 hours of gameplay if you are not using walkthrough. Some gamplay elements could have been used more in cases but that is not big deal. More of concern is optimization which is only thing that is not done right on pc version of a game.  My rating for LA Noire is without problems with optimization 9/10, but with problems with optimization is 8/10.",

Most of the game was made up of asking questions and figuring out if people are telling the truth, but the huge story arc around the 4 desks and flashbacks kept me entertained enough to play through this surprisingly long game (I had all dlc). I also grew to really like the characters and the actors did a great job performing them. Also, working on 4 different desks is really cool since you get to see the different branches of the police and what they work with. There is alot of driving, but street crimes keep you busy when driving to the next location.

The story follows Cole Phelps, a detective from L.A who's routinely solving crimes and getting promoted while on the job. He'll encounter many scandals about the LAPD and people question his background and sometimes even hates him for being the survivor of World War 2 on his squad. This game features case solvings, and use motion face recongition to help you determine if they are telling the truth, if you think you have doubt its the truth, or they are outright lying. There's not that much variety of weapons, but in this era of the 40's you'll see common weapons from the era, such as the Tommy Gun and the Colt M1911. The player will get to examine evidence and the crime scene it self. Cole Phelps is also sharp on his style of clothing. I'll have to say my favorite suit would be the 'noob suit' 'The Golden Boy'. This game also carries a wide amount of vehicles and all of them are also from the 1940's era. Overall, the game is extraordinary and has a rich story and wide amount of gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the motion face recongition is very fine. The only thing that bothers me, it's that it's not really an acutal detective game, as it's all following one story and scripted. We should have been able to choose our own paths and that would have made this a what I would like to call an 'IGN Masterpiece 10/10'. My rating for this would be a 9.5/10.",

The game's system allows for someone who wants to play seriously to do so but also allows for someone who wants to just blow through as fast as possible to do just that. I really loved looking for clues, posing questions backed by evidence, and uncovering plots in cases, some of which are clever stylized recreations of actual cases from the time period.  Interesting story lines converge in a pretty well written overall story and feels pretty good when all is said and done. Play time is even better than most 3a titles anymore, at around 35 hours.  The game is set in 1947 L.A. and I loved the fact that when you got in a car you could hear radio brodacasts from stock footage from the time. The Jack Benny Show, old news broadcasts, and of course music from the 40's. The cast of characters is pretty massive and there are a lot of recogniseable faces and voices. Commercial actors, and T.V. and Movies actors alike, not just voices but whole guest apperances. pretty cool I thought. Also cool was the fact that vehicles are real vehicles, Hudson, Chevrolet, Ford, Packard etc.   You spend a lot of the game performing interviews to get along in cases and you have to pay attention to people's faces and voices to get an impression of truth or lies. The result is a really incredible looking facial animation set. It's like actually seeing people talk, no choppy dubbed looking animatronic movements. The only complaint in this subject is that the voice acting isn't always very good. gets a little campy here and there.  The game is gritty and covers a lot of situations. Marital problems, drug use, mental health, corruption, political standings etc.   Definately a Rockstar title, lots of shooting and language but I felt it fit pretty much every situation so it didn't detract from game play except for some of the street crimes ( optional side missions)  All in all I'd say get this and play it if you're looking for something cerebral and engaging. If you just want a run and gun though you're not going to like L.A Noire",

Noire quickly, it's the story of a LAPD cop named Cole Phelps and his rise &amp; fall in the police system, all while questioning a bunch of people about various crimes. This game manages to immerse you into the past, in the late 40's as a LA police officer trying to climb the ladder.  I like alot of things about this game: The ambience, the music, the facial system, the captivating storyline, the relevance of almost everything placed in the decor, the dialogue, etc, and the list goes on. Rockstar/Team Bondi (R.I.P.) have done an amazing job on this game, making sure to create a different feel than in their previous games (such as Bully or GTA). There is no other game like this one, and that's a quality I love when it comes to good games.  The story will run you at the very minimum at least 26 hours (DLC included) and you can then retry past cases individually to try and get better. I like to play through L.A. Noire about once every 1/1,5 years (it's kinda like a movie, where it's as enjoyable as the first time once you let some time pass and come back to it).  I would recommend getting the complete edition of this game to any fan of Noire TV series or movies, and fans of well scripted detective games. DO NOT come into L.A. Noire expecting exactly the same as GTA but as a cop in the 40's because you will be very dissapointed. That being said, the game is amazing, probably the most immersive game i've played. ",

You just drive between fixed locations, which your partner can do as well. - cars feel not so different and unrealistic; there is no point in driving anything but your police car - again the GTA heritage: controls are not really well suited for clue finding - no saving, so you can't redo certain parts you failed without replaying the whole case (episode if you will). You can still retry the action scenes if you fail those, but not the interrogations for example. - unskippable cutscenes - the story is progressing slowly and is too linear for my taste and age (you are not given much choice, at least until I played - didn't finish it)",

Logic of what answers to give Ie, after asking a suspect a question you can either 1)truth 2)doubt 3) lie. It is sometimes 'puzzle game logic,' in that the correct choice is not only not obvious, but not logical. Sometimes when you select doubt, you basically say.... 'are you sure' yet other times you outright accuse them of murder. And sometimes I can anaswer doubt, doubt, truth for 3 questions, all three responces are about the same ... 'are you sure, you should tell me more,' yet I was correct... not a point in the games favour when I can be correct or incorrect and not quite understand why.

            "review_text": "L.A. Noire is an open world story oriented detective game, to describe it shortly, set in 1947. You play as Cole Phelps, a detective from the LAPD; during the course of the game, you solve different cases as you are promoted between different desks such as traffic, homicide etc. During the game, you are aided by your partner (which is a different detective for each desk).  The cases are very interesting and have stories which only last for one case or even several cases, which will tie together in the end (for example the homicide desk). The game is very heavily story-oriented and besides the cases, it tells a very suspenseful story of Cole Phelps' division fighting in the Pacific theatre of war in WW2 and his comrades, how they adjusted after the war, and how Cole discovers corruption and connections with gangsters deeply within the LAPD.  The gameplay is focused on exploration, as you need to search for clues at various crime scenes to piece together the big picture. A very innovative and still amazing feature is the motion capture technology used in this game which renders facial expressions with astonishing detail. This is needed, because you need to interrogate witnesses who may or may not withhold information from you - you need to deduct if a person is lying (using evidence to prove it) or not telling the entire truth. Your partner may sometimes be able to suggest places to try next to advance the case.  The city, Los Angeles, is beautifully rendered and captures the film noir atmosphere perfectly. Because the game focuses on the story, the city is mostly used as a backdrop - there are no activities outside of a couple of side missions called street crimes. These are usually short but very exciting missions. There are quite a lot of beautiful cars you can drive, although the driving isn't anything special (the feeling is mostly similar to GTA San Andreas).  The story is quite long but very engaging and will keep you glued to the seat until the end!  Summary  Pros:  - Excellent story - Authentic film noir atmosphere of 1947 Los Angeles - the city, the cars, the music - just perfect - Unique gameplay features - collecting clues, interrogating suspects/witnesses - Extremely detailed facial expressions  Neutral: - Driving mechanics  - Shooting mechanics  Cons: - Occasional stuttering even on high end machines - frame rate locked to 30 fps (but otherwise playable)  Overall: If you are a fan of such games (I recommend Mafia 1 and 2 for a similar feeling) this game is excellent!",

The game has references to locations, films, cars and cases from the actual period but never really took full advantage of the period or the police perspective. The period however was well replicated for the game and the open world is pretty much flawless.  The game itself revolves around point and click investigations of crime scenes and interrogations using the truth/doubt/lie reaction system in combination with the suspect's/witness' reactions. The investigation then develops based on the amount of evidence found and correct interrogation options chosen. However choosing the wrong options or missing evidence will result in you missing out sections of the case as you are not prompted to visit key areas or talk to key people. This can be a problem as the doubt/lie options in interrogations seems to be inconsistent, and evidence needed for the lie option is quite often circumstantial.   The story focuses on the character of Cole Phelps who has returned from fighting in Japan to take up a position in the California Police Department. Phelps is a straight policeman with a cool head and quickly rises through the ranks as he continually produces results. The story is generally generic and dull as Cole Phelps is such a reserved character and outside of the cases there is minimal story. The cases however are, for the most part, interesting and varied.   Pro's:",
