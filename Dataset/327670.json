            "review_text": "Matching games are a dime a dozen these days and the genre mash-ups have seen a meteoric surge thanks to the popularity of Puzzle Quest. If you've stumbled onto a mobile device's app store recently then chances are you've seen a dozen or so examples in just the last week. Even the supposed last bastion of 'hardcore' gaming that is PC has been infiltrated by an impressive brigade of match 3s, chain-linkers and gem puzzlers. So with Ironcast adding to those numbers on Steam, should we really care?  Oh Hell yes.  Puzzle Quest sparked imaginations due to its blending RPG features into a familiar formula. Ironcast does something similar by taking the core aspects of multitasking strategy titles like FTL and distilling them into components that suit a more casual, yet still complex model. You're not going to be making split-second decisions that decide the fate of the lives depending on you a la XCOM but that's not to say that the depth afforded by these elements isn't going to challenge you at every turn. Ironcast is more than tough, at times it can feel downright unfair. You're a one woman army with the odds against you from the very beginning and each encounter is finely tuned to make that apparent.  You are Aeres Powell, an Ironcast pilot fighting for the British Empire in an alternate Steampunk timeline where France has declared war and battles are fought with enormous mechanised monstrosities. The traditional stiff upper lip manner of speech and premise that France hasn't yet surrendered may suggest a comedic tone but the story is a well-written and convincing account of war-torn Victorian England. Those seeking lore to flavour the gameplay will find a moderately gritty tale that will make you care when you hear the consequences of a bad decision or mission failure.  You might think I've left discussing the gameplay this late due to its simplicity when the truth is that I'm unsure how to simplify it enough to fit this review. You can make three matches in a turn, collecting one of four different matters; ammo, coolant, energy and repair nodes. Each adds to a stockpile that can be used for a variety of actions that do not consume a turn. So far, so simple you might think. This is when the aforementioned strategy elements kick in. Each material can be used to power certain parts of your mech: your two weapons, your shields and your locomotive drives. Charging each system requires a combination of two resources so while you can potentially make an unlimited number of maneuvers in a turn, you'll quickly deplete your reserves leaving you entirely defenceless if you're reckless.  With that previous paragraph covering roughly a third of what you need to know to succeed, it's safe to say there's a wealth of tactics and knowledge to be gleaned from the competent tutorials and trials by fire. Balancing the demands of your mech with the need to manipulate the play-field is stressful enough without considering the advanced factors like evasion, over-heating, link nodes, overdrive and targeting specific body parts. On top of all of this, you have a total of twelve slots for augmentations and a wealth of equipment so customisation is key to winning the toughest missions. I've finished battles to find myself reclining into my seat physically exhausted, not realising how tense I'd become over the course of particularly tough battles. Becoming so involved and immersed is something I'd never thought possible in a game of this genre.  It is unrelentingly tough at times and you're not expected to be able to win first time round. Like Majora's Mask's looming moon, there's an enormous boss approaching headquarters that marks the deadline of each playthrough. All missions cost one day and with only 9 to spare you must choose the most rewarding path through the offerings. Certain missions will see you engaged in out and out combat whilst others require surviving a set number of turns, recovering cargo, or disabling enemies without killing them. Gathering scrap, war assets, blueprints, experience, and augmentations is vital to success but even though death is permanent, it is not a setback. Your score is added to a Global Unlock tally that rewards you with many permanent perks, pilots, and vehicles which not only boost your chances but make replaying an absolute pleasure.  Visually, both sides of this genre combination are often underwhelming. The art style involved here is really quite appealing with the character portraits and general tone evoking a convincing steampunk era. The animations of the mechs, from the arcs of energy weapons to flames billowing out of weakened components are a cool touch but it's understated throughout. The simplicity does get a little repetitive after extended playtime but your focus will rarely linger on the imagery for long periods.  I've said it before and it's worth reiterating, Ironcast is unforgiving. It's also inventive, smart, rewarding, and satisfying to the degree that all other games have fallen to the wayside since I started. This review was ready for writing at the 6 hour mark so all extra hours since have been pure indulgence and addiction. In a genre so devoid of even attempting to innovate, Ironcast is a masterpiece and quite easily one of my favourites games of this year.",

Negatives: * Not enough strategic depth. * Not enough variations in weapon upgrades or shield upgrades to justify it being a roguelike * It seems that the game wasn't originally meant to be a roguelike as it's really story heavy. * You cannot see your opponents moves * Your opponent only has one visible stat, which is the coolant.  I played 3 different sessions of this and just didn't find the playthroughs different enough from each other. If the developer is willing to improve on the game's core mechanics through patches this could be a great game.  Currently it is fun for maybe a few hours. It really is worth buying if you're a huge puzzle quest fan, but do not expect this to get even near to the same level in terms of complexity and build diversity.",

            "review_text": "I played this game at Pax East 2015 was impressed that it was a day 1 purchase for me.  I bought it day 1 and got to see all the extra features that I did not get to try at the convention was really impressed.  Gameplay: I can see the similiarites from FTL and from a typical match 3 gem game. You have two weapons and two defensive moves that can be used every round. Both kind of devices use different resources (minus coolant as that is used for both) you also get to do 3 matches on the gem board to gather resources for said skills. Do you match some ammo gems and shot a few rounds and then use the next two matches to get more? Or do you go for a more balanced approach and try to keep your defenses at their top tier every turn.  Once you get the basics down they introduce active and passive abilities, special gems to match and also the ability to target specific parts of the enenmy.  After every mission you go back to your hanger where you spend salvage to repair or upgrade your mech.   Graphics: Not sure how to describe them, but they do the job. Simple but perfect for what this game is.  Music: Love it.  Story: Simple but enjoyable. You get to make choices for the missions which adds to the rogue-lite feel of it. An enemy cargo ship oftered their cargo to spare their life. I agreed and I got the choice to still turn on them and kill their ship for salvage. Simple choice system but really enjoyable.  Final Thoughts: Great game, if you enjoyed Puzzlequest or games like that it is a must buy. The staff is also very friendly speaking with them directly at Pax and also on the forums.  9/10",

Match 3+ but with limited number of matches per turn, makes you think before matching.  4. Replayability. As long as you don't rage quit, the game by design is very replayable.   Cons:  1. Frustrating. Be prepared to die every time you play. But each time you die, you usually unlock something new to help you in your next playthrough. You'll often feel like you're never making progress though.  2. I honestly didn't care what was being said between battles.    I'm probably not going to play this a lot. It doesn't overly appeal to me. I'd rather play Puzzle Quest. But it's hard to thumbs down a game that works properly, doesn't have microtransactions and tons of DLC, and doesn't appear to pander to Social Justice Warriors.   A good one for fans of FTL to pick up in a sale some time.",

            "review_text": "OK, I just finally beat the game... barely!  Take that Mr. Matthew Spencer !!!!  (he's the person listed in the end credits responsible for game 'balancing')  Anyway, I hope you seriously consider adding the ability to sell/scrap old parts in the game (even if it’s only for 50% of their original purchase cost). This would greatly improve the role-playing aspect and wouldn’t change the “balance” all that much.  Although I changed my review from no to yes, I still can't fully recommend this game in its current state. It's WAAAAAY too frustrating!!! MAKE SURE YOU RESEARCH TIPS ON HOW TO BEAT THE GAME IF YOU EVEN WANT TO HAVE A CHANCE AT WINNING!!!!  It kind of feels like you made the game ridiculously hard to compensate for the short campaign length. It should be longer and you should have the option of taking your supped-up Ironcast through the game once more after defeating the fnal boss. That would be a blast and make it all that much more worth while!! Take that!...and that!...and that!...phew..phew..phew!!! Who's laughing now you giant walking trash can ! : )     ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW   NOOOOOOOOooo NoO NO NOO NOOOoOOoooooooooo....not AGAIN!!!!!  Please please please balance this game!!! It would be amazing!!!  Sooooo much potential but instead this game just settles for 'Frustrating'. : (  I get the concept of the whole unlocking thing and the joy of trying over and over to get better at something, but please alow me to save at LEAST either before or after one of the big boss fights. I got killed in a 'medium' game right after finally defeating a big boss battle. It was way harder then the boss battle!    Also, if you gave out more scrap then people would be able to enjoy playing around with the upgrade part of the workshop. This would do a lot to increase the RPG element of the game. As it is, the only thing I can ever afford is the occasional health increase.  (On a side note, what about adding fun to the game by having the ability to customize your Ironcast so that you look different from your enemies.)  At least let me sell/scrap my old parts for scrap so I can upgrade my Ironcast! The option to reroll the percs at least one time would also be great as it is not uncommon to get only one 'type' of perc to choose from.  These small changes would go a long way to balance the game.   If you want to change any of these aspects of the game, I would be happy to write a positive review. : )  The concept behind the game mechanics is a great idea.  It would be a shame to just abandon it in it's current state.",

There are all kinds of gameplay elements that keeps the game interesting, also the perma dead element brings in nice game dynamics keeping you motivated in trying another round. The artwork is beautiful although it might be more detailed, for example I'd like to see the mechs in much more detail.

Ironcast is no different, and after about 20 games, I was only able to confront the boss once, and died a glorious death 'so close to beat him'.  Is there any winning strategy in this game ? I'm not sure. What I've learned so far, is that Defense is key to survival. If you let your guard down, you will suffer. Oh boy, yes you will. So Defense and Energy Upgrade are a must, but be wary of Energy cost, since some Defenses requires 3 Energy et other ones 4 Energy - this might not seem a lot, but when you are 1 Energy short, you pay a big price in Health, that will later transfer in Golden Bars in the workshop - those precious Bars you need to upgrade.   What about Weapons ? Whatever your choice, you need one to be used against strong armor and little to no movement (single shot with high damage), and one against fast movement and little to no armor (multiple shots with low damage). Splash damage can be good, as long as you are not in a mission where you have to preserve any component of an enemy Ironcast - just check the splash damage is under the current opponent Defense level.  One note about Cooling. It's used for Weapons, Defense and Movement. Even if the initial reserve is fairly high, if you use them a lot, you'll be short soon, and working a machinery without Cooling is like setting yourself ablaze.  On my own, I like to play the first character (Defense and Movement bonuses) with the second Ironcast (Energy weapons) and play like a tower (almost no movement). I usually bet on upgrading Energy reserve up to 12, Defense then Weapons (same ones, but better if available) ; and on the abilities offered each time you reach a level : Cooling + Defense + Golden bars bonuses. My only weakness is that at a certain point, my weapons might not be up to the task.",

On top of this there's random missions each in-game 'day', with each mission taking up that entire day and then after you complete it you move on to the next. Every mission gives you currency, experience, and blueprints you can use to purchase new equipment for your mech. After 10 days a boss shows up in London and you have to fight it.  All of that seems like it would work well, but it's all tweaked too far on the 'nearly impossible' side. At the base level you have to complete missions to get stronger, but the drops after each mission are random so you could go for a while without getting a weapon or other equipment that will be enough of an upgrade to justify the significant cost to purchase it. Every time you level up the abilities it offers you to select from are random, so you could go for a while without getting any that are useful in more than the most situational of situations. The matching gameplay ends up like how it sometimes happens in Puzzle Quest, where on occasion you might end up without any gems of the resource you need and so aren't able to win not because of lack of skill, but because the RNG says 'nope'. And then you have to do all this preparation in 10 days. Like, imagine FTL if you had to fight the rebel mothership at the end of sector 2. That's how tight the timing has to be on everything.   After each failed attempt you gain experience towards a global profile level that unlocks bonuses that apply to each run. These bonuses are almost entirely useless on their own, however. Things like getting an additional +5 health per level up, when the default health for your Ironcasts are in the 800s and by the end of the game enemy weapons are doing around 180 damage per hit. The only way these global bonuses would help is if many, many, many levels were grinded out to have them add up to something significant. That's not my idea of fun.  You basically need to have perfect item drops plus perfect levelups plus perfect gem configurations in order to succeed. An ideal balance for roguelikes is to have the player's skill + strategy be able to overcome most of what randomness is thrown at them. This game is too far on the random side, to the point where player skill is almost meaningless. If you don't get the right drops or have enough global bonuses to boost you up, you won't stand a chance regardless of how perfectly you execute on your strategies.  It's really a shame, because the game looks fantastic and the setting is quite fun. If it were tweaked a little more fairly it would be quite an enjoyable experience.",

            "review_text": "Overall this is a great game it could have done with a bit more  variety in missions , Ironcast's , upgrades and a longer campaign in my opinion the turns until you encounter the boss are to short  so its highly likely you will be well underpowered to actually face  the boss fights.  There is some rng involved off cource on what you get for loot drops and gems that you can match up wich makes it interesting and fun  to replay with different commanders and ironcasts as you unlock them.  The game could use a online vs mode with other players i think that would  work well select your equipment , outfitting and face each other in online mayhem. Also a few tweaks to the user interface would not hurt selecting a particular  sub system like shields , weapons etcetera will cover up the enemy ironcast with  a ui menu wich is annoying and takes away from the aesthetics of the game.  I hope that the Developers will fine tune this game some more and perhaps release  dlc for it wich i think it can defenitly use its fun to play and i come back for more  i would have no problem paying a bit extra for good dlc to extend gameplay.  Overall a great game with a great price tag bought it at the promotion sale  wich was worth the money although even after the sale ends the price is still  very reasonable i do reccomend this game to any who are trying to figure out if its worth a purchase or not ( yes it is ! )",

It does get a little frustrating when you can't win a match because you got boned by chance but it's a great game to pick up and spend 30 mins on before moving onto something a little deeper.",

It has minor faults - the game ends too quick for my tastes as I was enjoying it immensely until the abrupt end, and the story is decent but concluded sloppily - but I had a great deal of fun in the 18 hours it took me to beat it, and hopefully the ending sets up a very well earned sequel in the future.  At £10, this game is a no-brainer for puzzle and strategy fans alike.",

But fun and well-polished and very atmospheric and addictive. Story, artwork and music are top-notch, game mechanics adequate so not to spoil your game. Recommended to anyone who likes Victorian era and Steampunk. To authors: thank you. If you will be updating this game please add more Ironcasts and maybe think about balancing weapons and parts a little, so that they would allow different strategies (energy weapons with % of killing shields? projectiles with % of crippling drives?) Also would LOVE to see AI improved and having actual board we could iteract with.  Right now 'stealing' energy/ammo from AI does not affect its behavior, it would be great to see it suffer without ammo.",

Had me entertained for 10+ hours.   My only concerns:  - Mech/pilot variety:  Of the 4 mechs I'm offered so far every model is basicly the same. Only some stats are a bit different and the special powers are mostly boring and/or useless. Why can't I play a steam tank later in the game? Why not a totaly different mech? Same with the pilots who don't change the game that much.  - Random gems/difficulty: While my very first playthrough was pretty successful, during most of the following ones I got f***ed by the gems appearing (e.g. no coolant/energy/ammo gems for several turns) or an supprisingly strong enemy pretty early. So most of the time I had to start over after only 2-3 Missions where in FTL you have the chance to escape every fight and still make it to the end boss most of the time (and die there).",
