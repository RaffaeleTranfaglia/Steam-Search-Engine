That being said, i want to clairify something. People comenting about te price of my setup are both right and wrong. I have a dual 1440p setup. One monitor for arma and one for misc things. Arma is very cpu intensive, so I am running an i7 5820k @4.5Gz w/ water cooling, as well as a 980Ti and multiple SSDs in RAID 0. the 32 gigs of DDR4 overkill, but i got it on sale, so why not. This is to acheive a minimum of 60fps Ultra (1440p) at all times, even in multiplayer. This game is beutiful, realistic, and has endless possibilities to explore, so why dont you give it a shot!",

            "review_text": "If you're coming to Arma 3 as an Arma series veteran, you already know what to expect. For the most part, the game hasn't changed since the last installment, but then it's always felt a little bit like Bohemia Interactive are still building on the groundwork laid back in 2001 by Operation Flashpoint, in the world's longest ever game of 'development Buckaroo'. Thankfully, the whole thing has yet to fall to pieces in any significant manner; it's quite happy to continue wobbling uneasily for now.  Arma has a reputation. It's known to be frighteningly obtuse, bewilderingly complex, and often hilariously broken. I can tell you right now that Arma 3 is no different, and absolutely still deserves that reputation. Thankfully, I don't think it's unfair to say that this is the closest an Arma game has come to being 'user friendly'. The controls have been tweaked, and the interface refined a little to accommodate more modern tastes. For these improvements alone, I do recommend it to newcomers to the series over any previous entry. Coming from any other modern FPS game, it will still take a good few hours of what can feel an awful lot like hard work to get to grips with the controls, but I honestly think Arma 3 will see a far lower 'drop-out rate' of newbies who were frustrated to the point of giving up by the previous games.  At the time of writing, the elephant in the room is the lack of content available. When compared to Arma 2 (which is handsomely bolstered by an array of official expansion packs), the amount of hardware available to play with is frustratingly slim. In many cases, opposing armies are equipped with identical vehicles which get a slightly different paint job at best. For anyone used to the myriad of variants and oddments available in Arma 2, Arma 3 can feel awfully disappointing. Fortunately, this is alleviated to some extent by the strong mod community. It has long been the case that the best parts of the Arma games are the parts not developed by Bohemia Interactive themselves, and Arma 3 is most definitely continuing this 'tradition'. Nevertheless, I can't help but feel that the game could've done with a few months more time in the oven before full public release.  Speaking of the mod community, I think it's criminal that almost none of the best, near-indispensible mods from Arma 2 have been officially integrated. For a self-professed 'war simulator', Arma 3 is hugely lacking in basic features like being able to rest your weapon on surfaces (even with a visible bipod), or tow damaged vehicles.  For all its flaws, though, Arma 3 is still a blast to play. If you can find a decent group of like-minded gamers with access to a voice-over-net server, you're in for some of the best gaming you'll ever experience. Sure, you'll probably have to load up on mods to satisfy your need for variety. And sure, sometimes the game will crash spectacularly, or the physics engine will flip out and kill you for standing too close to a wall. But when you're standing on a hilltop, looking out over an enemy outpost with your squadmates while a CAS helicopter strafes an enemy APC and spots targets for a distant sniper team; when everything clicks together in the way that only Arma can manage, you'll be glad to have been along for the ride.",

            "review_text": "I played this game about 90 hours which is more than any of my friends at the moment.  Can't really compare it to any other game. Arma is just Arma, period. xD If you haven't played arma before then you migh think that this is the game about shooting or operating armored vehicles, but no, not really. Most of the time you will run around some forests trying to spot the enemy and figure out how to take them out. Then you probably gonna be spoted by the enemy and be dead in a seconds. Repeat.  Playing this game requires strategic thinking - you can't just take gun and take enemy out, no, it doesn't work that way. This game features two maps: big and huge, including towns, forests, mountains, flat fields and graaaas grass grass. Yeah, i love grass in this game - looks fantastic. xD So... Where was i? oh, right, the map is big and you can go by your feet or take armored vehicles, civilian vehicles, helicopters or planes... You gonna waste time to get to destination point and after hour of travelling there you will be shot by some weirdo in the woods. Repeat.  Anyway, this is nice game(yet you need some great rig to run it) with limitless editor and mod support. Best expirience achieved in coop missions with friends. Team Work is necessary.  Pros: +Limitless warfare simulator +Graphics looks beatiful 80% of the time +in-game editor allows you to create your own missions +Steam workshop support: download missions created by other users or get more weapons and vehicles. +It's not CoD +It's not BF4 either +Bugs are fun  Cons: -It's probably boring for players from other shooter games -Limitless CPU usage: your cpu will cry like a вitсh during the 100 vs. 100 battle with tanks and helis. -Graphics doesn't look beautiful 20% of the time. -Not so big default weapon arsenal(but there are mods, hey) -Multiplayer performance sucks sausage -Campaign is not open world and not coop as it was in Arma 2 -Bugs are still bugs even if they're fun -AI has IQ equal to chair. Or maybe table.   P.S. Did you really read it all? Lol. If you consider yourself as a 'hardcore fps shooter player and cod is for kids bla bla bla' - try arma, waste your time, enjoy true hardcore. P.P.S. I was really bored so i wrote all this. Don't blame me, please.",

            "review_text": "Arma 3 from Bohemia Interactive is the latest in its military simulation series of games, which began with the original Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis. With Arma 3, both the visuals and gameplay have received major improvements and redesigns that result in a game that is far more polished and entertaining than previous entries in the series. Even more so than previous games in the series, Arma 3 is primarily a massive military simulation sandbox that only grew larger with the modding community.  While either in the editor or during missions, players will be traversing the Aegean islands of Stratis and Altis of Greece, the latter of which is a massive 270 km² in size. New to the series, players will be able to navigate underwater environments using either submersible vehicles or diving in wetsuits. The list of weapons and vehicles available to players is rather difficult to grasp at first as the variety from everything from tanks and airplanes to machine guns and sniper rifles is outright extensive. As the game takes place during the mid-2030s, most vehicles and items are still recognizable in addition to the inclusion of in-development warfare technology that has yet to be deployed on current battlefields.  Players new the Arma series can learn the basics through showcase levels that also highlight new gameplay features and graphical improvements to the engine. In addition, players can test their firearm skills in various shooting challenges that vary in type and difficulty. When finished training, players can then browse through the multiplayer lobby for online matches or delve into the continually-growing selection of community-created scenarios through the Steam Workshop. Players can create scenarios using the in-game editor while having access to all of the game's resources from vehicles to weapons. The process of downloading scenarios through the Steam Workshop only requires one click which in turn automatically downloads the new content.  The game focuses heavily on infantry combat and that is where it shines. However, is does offer up an impressive number of vehicles with which to traverse the vast distances on offer and to wreak havoc onto your enemies. Everything from civilian hatchbacks to heavily armoured tanks to transport helicopters and unmanned drones can be used and there are no cosmetic vehicles to be found.   Some areas have wrecks of cars lying around which obviously are of no use to you and it can be very frustrating to find yourself in the middle of nowhere, walk into a town in search of a car and find the whole place devoid of anything useful. The vehicles are also delightfully fragile, which is not only realistic, but serves to keep the infantry focused gameplay balanced. You won't be any safer flying around in a helicopter than you are running around on the ground as heat seeking missiles traverse the distance between you and the launcher very fast, so if your reflexes aren't good enough, you're going to lose your tail rotor, which will bring you down.  There are more than enough weapons to keep you interested for a long time and the ability to customize them with a plethora of accessories is a nice touch which enables you to make your gun completely your own. Realistic ballistics and damage models make the game very engaging and disbelief is effortlessly suspended as the game world immerses you in a tactical combat simulator experience unlike any other.  Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, as you progress, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.  The Crysis series can move over for benchmark tests as Arma 3 is without doubts one of the best looking PC games of 2013. Nearly every aspect of the game's engine has improved dramatically which is evident in the extensive visuals menu with toggles and sliders for every modern graphical setting. Arma 3 requires the latest and greatest hardware to run everything the game has to offer on maximum settings. Fortunately, the game's various graphical options allow for scaling back to a more manageable framerate.  Audio enthusiasts wont be disappointed either as all of the game's sound effects contain a strong sense of realism. From gun shots whizzing through the air to the landscape being shaken by explosions, the sound effects truly immerse players in the battlefields. Performance wise, Arma 3 has been improved through recent patches but still has some problems with optimization on even the most powerful hardware. Players should research the game's recommended specifications as an upgrade or two of computer hardware might be required for playing the game with an optimal framerate.  Arma 3 is the definite game of the series thus far combining everything that Bohemia Interactive has learned over the course of development. Most fans of the Arma series will be delighted by the massive sandbox and in-depth editor available for modding. Ultimately, Arma 3 is what players make out of it for themselves, either if it's messing around in the editor or joining friends online for multiplayer matches. With Arma 3, Bohemia Interactive proves yet again that it knows how to expertly craft military simulation games.",

With increased player control/movement, enhanced mechanics for vehicles, weapon systems (if you buy it), flight models (if you buy it -_-), and much more! The control in tight spaces should be worked on, this is no call of duty, the controls are clunky, but are a vast improvement over the previous installment (arma 2). Another of the top complaints of this game is the NETCODE. It is terrible under load, but again, is much better than arma 2.   This game is mostly open source, Meaning that players are able to change almost every aspect of the game from the amount of fog to adding dinosuars into the game. The things you can do are endless and that is it's selling point. Bohemia Interactive leaves the imagining to you and the community to come up with your own story or missions. This game is heavily supported by the modding community and for good reason. The scripting language for ARMA 3 is .sqf, Based off the C++ coding language, but it seems like a little of everything works. (there is alot of things you can do to make somehting work) I have based 4 years of my life modding and playing arma 2 and arma 3, making this my most played game, by a long shot.  The best way to play this game is modded and with friends. By it's self, arma is fun, but somewhat bland, but that seems like that was part of the plan... BI (Bohemia Interactive) made the game as basic as possible to allow you and it's users to change it the way they like it!   Do I recommend this game?  YES!

            "review_text": "The most comprehensive military sim out there, setting you loose on a massive island with all of the weapons, vehicles and scenarios you could possibly wish for.  The game itself has remained almost unchanged since the original Operation Flashpoint, released over 10 years ago. However, of all the iterations, Arma 3 is the one that has improved things the most. These aren't big changes, but merely small gameplay tweaks that make it feel more polished and smooth.  Graphically, it's convincing. It isn't always beautiful but it gets the atmosphere of a real place just right and the large view distances are key to making it feel ALIVE. You can tell that the developers did their homework when researching the island that this game is based on (Yup, it is a real place).  If you don't know anything about this game, the best word to sum it up with would be 'realistic'. You are a single soldier in a large, real-time conflict. You can die from a single bullet or stray shell and alone you have limited influence over how the battle will go. Expect to be crawling through muddy fields or cowardly hiding behind cover as bullets whiz overhead. Don't expect to behave like Rambo and to survive.  I wouldn't consider this game 'complete' just yet- for months they have been rolling out updates and patches and at the time of writing, the main campaign is only 1/3 released. That being said, it's the community that really supports this game. Mods like Dayz show how flexible and open-ended the game can be. Really, Arma 3 can be seen as offering an island and great multiplayer support, letting the community come up with the best content.  Personally, I haven't spent much time in the large-scale multiplayer side of things. I prefer playing missions with a friend and those experiences have been enjoyable and memorable. Expect a single objective to take a while and for it to get rather frustrating as you die through seemingly no fault of your own. I've also spent a lot of time simply exploring the large island. Yup, on my own, with no NPCs or other players. I love the sights and sounds. I love exploring over the next mountain, or lounging about on a beach, soaking up the digital rays. I don't expect other people to find that fun and neither does the game- the fantastic mission editor simply opens up countless opportunities for you and I chose one of the most dull and mundane simply to see how much enjoyment I could extract from it.  The community is what makes this product what it is. They're serious but loyal and will likely be playing this game for years to come. You'll make good friends if you behave in a sensible and team-worthy fashion and thanks to the Steam workshop support there are thousands of mods and maps to download to boost the number of scenarios the game has to offer.  Buying this game is an investment. The developers and community have pledged their loyalty to build it into a must-have title, though it could take several years to reach that stage. Don't expect gameplay that's easy to jump in to, nor should you expect a fun standalone experience. But this game is no COD. By default it's not a mainstream game, but the possibilities it offers you are almost endless.",

It's even better when the suffering is compounded by playing with friends. After multiple restarts because a BDRM annihilated you with pinpoint accuracy from 3 miles away, you'll have a great time.  The main problem with this game is that it's set in 2035 and you're fighting Post-Human Space Iranians in a tank from the 70s. Thankfully, this game is supported by an excellent modding community and you can use mods to take the game back to the greatest era of human history; The Cold War. You might not get the chance to die on the atomic battlefields of the North German plains, but you can get pretty close to it thanks to this game and the dedication of the modding community.   Eventually, you will reach the mod singularity where you will simply have too many mods. You will spend hours in virtual arsenal making the perfect loadout.

            "review_text": "Arma 3 is a tactical military shooter, it has an unique spot in having the biggest maps with most players combined. Imagine yourself 120+ players in 2 or 3 teams fighting it out incl vehicle warfare... Tanks planes helis even boats included in that list, described at the shop description arma really sends you to war. The bad side is that this comes at a cost of at least a good pc to even being able to play it to full potential. And even then you limited by what the servers can pull off, eventually you will enjoy the game a lot more in smaller groups.  But arma 3 is not all about war, with steam work shop full of content or not to say the least about 'armaholic'... Arma 3 has so many possibilities that you won't run out of content to play quickly. With arma life which pretends to be a GTA with real players as cops medics and military. Included with gangs and your own choice to be the bad or the good guy and fight it out in the wild wild west. Or mods based on the older arma 2 mod DAYZ still to this day better than the standalone... But also with more known game styles like KOTH which is more a team death match with a level and money systeem.  What the best side and also directly the worst side of arma 3 is that everyone can hire a server. Games can never really die in this way, look at how many still play arma 2 daily... When a game dies mostly seen in EA games shutting down their servers, arma on the other hand will never really close down. Aslong everyone can hire a server whenever they feel like it... Great community can grown upon this but also people can abuse it, with scripts with saved slots as example. Pay the server owner €10.- a month and you can always play (join the server because only vips(donator) can join the last 20/30 slots). While every server has to pay hes server rent, servers with scripts like this or those that show xx amount of players always on the server is a big issue. (mostly combined to too double the effect ofc...) It is funny because i've been admins on several servers, have seen how it has been run from several different points of view. And none of these server owners have ever used or felt forced to use any of these scandals so yes i'm surprised... While most just hire the server as a kind of donation to the game or those who get real donations from community members help the game thrive.  Arma 3 also has a great single player game the voice overs are sometimes weak to say the least but it goes... I won't really call it a story, although a story is being told, just see it like a training course for the multiplayer. ;) Arma 3 also gives you a very strong but still simple 3D game editor whereby making missions is as ease that everyone can do it. Or also known zeus which makes you being able to play as a game master, you can make missions or sent waves while you friends are playing. It gives you an eagles eye of view of the battlefield and gives you the tools to spawn and do almost anything you can Imagine. Arma 3 is one of those uncut gems and well worth every penny you put into it.",

It is a very renowned and creditable game because they showed their efforts to embody a variety of things in the game : constellations, military realities, and so on. We can easily find out about why it deserves to be popular.  We can create the mission by ourselves. This huge merit makes us to deal with enemies in a environment that continuously changes. Plus, we can play the game in various game missions, not a fixed ones.  Not only that, the addon system is a bonus factor that help us to enjoy the arma 3 in customised circumstances. You can imitate whatever you want using the addon system.  I want to say that you have to buy this game if you are reluctant to buy it. Given that arma series is a civilian eddition of VBS series, it is clear that this game is a perfact fit for you. I didn't mention lots of realities of arma 3 though.",

The usual hardcore users of this product however usually use it as a base for massive coop operations, including vehicle platoons, artillery support (manned and operated in a realistic manner by players) and infantry squads. You want to realistically call in a fire mission for the artillery? This is your game. You want to call in close air support for a strike on a sniper/tank/building? This is your game. You want to indulge yourself in close quarter combat with your squad? This is your game. You want to hunt down IEDs and the insurgents who placed them? This is your game.   Ok now, these massive coop operations are made possible and realistic by the modding community. This is a fact, the base game is (to the best of my knowledge) not ever used when it comes to any serious servers or communities.  The modding community supplies the realistic radio communications, the real word weapons, the medical simulation, better sounds, better graphics in some cases, better AI (!!!) and all kinds of maps, so YOUR platoon can deploy anywhere from Alaska to Zimbabwe. AND it brought you bipods (seriously Bohemia, how did it take you so long to implement freakin bipods in the game...).... This modding community made the game more realistic and created the fanbase it has today. Arguably the most attention Arma got in years came from the Zombie mod (not a fan btw, but still). And now Bohemia comes along and wants to charge you for DLC. Alright you might say, what is the DLC?   The DLC includes things as long range capable rifles and tools to be more accurate.  It also includes things like new helicopters and slingloading vehicles/objects.   These are argueably some of the main features for the marksmen and helicopter DLC respectivly.  Now, these features where added by the modding community YEARS ago. In arma 2 already. For absolutely free. They still exist in Arma 3 too. I do not see the need for the publisher to charge this amount of money for features the community pretty much figured out on its own. I would rather donate that money to a beatiful website called ARMAHOLICS and to certain mod developers on there. And arma 3 is a triple A game with a triple A price. As others pointed out already: People who preordered, played in the alpha etc. paid MORE money than people who waited for the steamsales to kick in. I can get the whole game cheaper and including DLCs than the chaps who where loyal to bohemia and this franchise in the first place.... what the ♥♥♥♥ .... seriosuly. That is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, even from a marketing perspective.   Here is my advice: If you are looking for the real arma experience (large-scale coop, usually vs. AI with differing amounts of military realism) buy the base game. Then find a appropriate server or group to play with. They will teach you how to mod the ♥♥♥♥ out of this game and you will never need the lame DLCs.",

I say this as someone who enjoys the following elements in games that I devote a lot of time to: Extensive, detailed cooperative play, and realism/immersion. If you're going to Arma looking to play the next Counterstrike or whatever, you're going to walk away disappointed.  Arma is more of a simulator than a casual shooter, and yes, there is Wasteland which is basically a worldwide deathmatch sandbox, and Arma 2 had DayZ (Which let's face it, is also a boring deathmatch sandbox with the inclusion of zombies), but to get the most out of an Arma game, you need to approach it for its strengths - the simulation aspect. You can play solo as a member of a squad (Depending on the mission - finding good missions can be a little tricky), or command AI using some non-traditional, but with some practice, easy to understand commands and play it like more of a strategy game.  In multiplayer, COOP is king in my opinion, but you can have large scale team-vs-team PVP which is a lot of fun as well. I admin a server that runs a large-scale coop mission 24/7 and it never fails to impress and challenge because the AI is smart enough in Arma games to allow for emergent gameplay - they'll flank, they'll fall back, they'll improvise, and it's different every time and you have to think. The engine takes some getting used to compared to the average shooter, but Arma 3 specifically is far less buggy than other Bohemia games have been. Being different isn't a reason in and of itself to dismiss it though.  If you're used to other games or approach it like a shooter, you might be annoyed with it, but if you give it time and learn it (and I can't stress enough how important it is to play a good mission in a coop setting to get the most out of it), it's hard to put down. Some of the best gaming experiences I've had have been a product of this game engine in coop with dozens of other people, and you owe it to yourself to give it a shot.  Treat it like a strategy game or simulation that has shooting involved, not like a CounterStrike-Of-Dutyfield alike.  Also steam sale so why the hell not?",

Yes, I don't have thousands of hours in it... but after getting back into King of the Hill (currently level 54 on it with 300+ hours in that mission/mod alone), I plan to change that. First game of mine to break 1000 hours... here I come!  Singleplayer runs beautifully though note that, even on regular difficulty, the AI can, and will, shred you unless you play to the absolute best of your ability... but even then...  Multiplayer, while not being the best in terms of stability and/or framerate (whether that be the fault of the servers or game's code), excels in other ways that games like Battlefield don't. Easily my favourite gamemode/mod/mission is King of the Hill -- 3 teams all fight it out in a ~500m radius circle. What makes it better than just 'run in and kill' like the Battlefield series? Vulnerable progression. You start out with a TRG 5.56mm; it's okay but you're going to lose most gunfights without the element of surprise. You want that next gun, scope, launcher or vehicle? Work for it. You earn money from vehicle destroys, kills, revives, healing teammates and sitting in the AO (the circle).  There are other great modes such as Wasteland which is similar to King of the Hill but, instead, everyone's spread far out across (typically) Stratis. You can group up with people or go lone wolf. Kill people, loot them, get money, buy things, kill more people. The thing that I dislike about Wasteland in comparison... is the lack of progression. It's just a sandbox pick-up and play gamemode/mission.  What I'd like to see happen with ARMA 3: - improved multiplayer performance and stability - free, non-DLC weapons and vehicles ported from ARMA 2 (and Chernarus too) - more than just 2 sniper rifles in Marksman DLC -- so many people are disappointed with the lack of content coming from these DLCs - something valuable and proper in the expansion of Late 2015",

Sadly Bohemia got creative and put the A3 in the near future, with more futuristic forces what pretty much killed the 'realistic mil sim' part for me. But still A3 is a great game. It's unbelievably moddable so I was able to get my modern military fix quickly with user created units.  So, the good: -upgraded graphics engine -gigantic map -bipods! Yea, after few years they put bipods in game! -shooting from vehicles - same as with bipods - finally! -new more smooth and natural animations -game is super moddable -as usual great mission editor (I pretty much spent all my time creating my own missions). -driving is way more enjoyable than in any prev Armas  Now the bad: -no female soldiers/civilians -(if COD could we can too) -insane gun swaying and bobbing, gets infuriating -stamina - your soldier will fall on his face after running for 10 seconds -compare to A2 not that many various units -still no tank/apc interiors -lots of people reporting insane lag/fps issues MP and SP.  Its a great game, and you can pretty much mod it to whatever you want - rpg/zombies/survival (blah...booring)/ military ops/racing- peek your fix. Still, if you are looking only for realistic military sim - get Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead and put the ACE mod into it - it will be insanely good and sadly better experience than A3.

I get it, that this was a tutorial phase; However, I could do with less fadeaway's and more actual gameplay.

Arma 3, may have it's flaws, but overall it isn't a bad game. If I were in charge, I would have modernized the graphics a bit, and put a greater emphasis on the smaller details such as battlefield damage to structures and the environment, the movement of the weeds, grass and tree's in the wind, and other little things to enhance the immersion experience.

The scales and graphics on Arma are pretty impressive, although as in many games, the graphics are less impressive up close, less the textures and more the number and complexity of objects, however, with a game of this size if each house was packed with objects, you can bet the frames are going to take a massive hit, what bohemia have done is find a reasonable balance with this.  Generally the environment looks great, there are some questionable physics interactions which can make for some strange happenings, although that is part of the charm with Arma.  If you want a military sim, that generally plays pretty well with a decent amount of guns and vehicles to mess about in then this is well worth it.

At first the game feels dull, almost boring. You´re bored as to why nothing happens and everything seems so slow, but once you get fired upon, or get targeted by enemy artillery fire and see several squadmates around you bite the dust as you barely survived an artillery shell that injured your legs to a point where you can´t run anymore - the game becomes extremely intense.  Your squad has been hit by artillery and you are among one of the few who kind of survived that attack, but your legs are injured and the next medic is 1 kilometer away from the AO. So you try to stay alive and slowly walk or crawl back to the military outpost in hopes of getting back to the EVAC zone in time (before the transport chopper flys off or the enemy decides to run a couple of bullets through the rest of your body).  So you hump back towards the military outpost that you and your team used to advance from, because you know you´re going to survive once you get there as there are many teammates and the EVAC zone is also back there. As you slowly make your way through the open field trying to stay as low as you can, crawling behind bushes - you suddenly hear shots from the distance and know that the enemies are advancing towards the EVAC zone and therefore towards you...  You try to make your way as fast as possible, when you read your teamchat talking about the EVAC chopper that is already on it´s way and almost there and you´re still 650 meters away. And as if that wasn´t enough of an issue, the enemies have spotted and are now starting to fire at you as well.  And as you keep crawling towards the EVAC zone and notice more and more shots hitting the ground very close to you, you know that you´re probably not going to make it. And suddenly you hear a sniper firing from the EVAC zone down towards your position. He shoots one enemy rifleman after another and suddenly the teamchat indicates that the EVAC area is clear and that the pilot is going to wait for you... you stand up and try to not make your teammates wait too long for you while feeling happy about having survived such a counterattack without having to click on Respawn.

            "review_text": "I really hate to say this, but you should wait to get this game until BIS gets it finished, assuming that happens. The reader should realize that I have almost 2000hrs in ArmA2. The 600 or so listed on my profile here is just since it got added to Steam and doesn't count the time pre-Steam.  So, as someone who plays exclusively with friends on listen servers, not on big public servers. As someone who plays mostly CTI maps (remember those BIS?), and as someone who spent most of those almost 2000hrs flying CAS in a jet (remember those BIS?), .......I can honestly say that I'm rather let down by ArmA 3 and it makes me very sad.  The interface has always been clunky from way back in OFP and before. The new backpack system seems to me to just be a reskin of the same thing. It does indeed make it a bit easier to use being able to drag and drop stuff (novel!!), and while I appreciate the work here.....I'd rather have seen the time spent on other things.  To be fair, two of the devs DID spend time locked up in Greece for a stupid reason. I think it was 11 months? This is something that is strictly forbidden to speak of on their forums for some odd reason. But, I understand this had a huuuuuuge impact on their development cycle as it was their two LEAD devs as I understand it. I get the feeling that they got back, and shoved development through in order to compete with the (then) new BF and CoD releases. I personally feel this was a huge, quivering pile of mistake. Because......they aren't really in competition with those games!!! It'd be like saying that chess competes with checkers and monopoly. All board games sure but vastly different. Same here! ArmA II was all about trying to make the game more of a military simulator. Though I think they had to admit some limitations here and there with the tech of the day without making the engine only playable on super computers. ArmA III seems to go away from this and I think it's trying to compete even more now with those other games in some ways.....maybe I'm wrong? It just doesn't feel like the team is as worried about realisim any longer.  For me, the fact that it's set in 2035 is a HHHHUUUUUUUGE turn-off and almost a game breaker right there. That, and there's ONE jet in the game thus far.....one AND it's some old trainer POS to boot.....nice.....well guess this confirms my hunch I've had for a while now. BIS seems to hate fixed wing like Blizzard hates melee! It's all about rotary wing! Which is fine and dandy unless you need an A10 or a Spooky. By 2035 we assume naturally that these have been phased out, so where are their replacements? Hell, at this point I'd be happy with an F15 that I can just fly and do stand-off attacks with from miles away.....oh right that's what the choppers are for!  Am I ranting a bit there? Um, yes sorry, but I was just looking SO foward to this game!!! Heck I even did the pre-order on the delux version!! NOW? Ya I'm kinda not happy about that.  I fire the game up now and then after I see an update downloading. Just to mess around with the undrivable pickups and do target practice with the assault rifles that have recoil like a .45-110 every shot......it's like going to the playboy mansion only nobody's there.  So, I'd say to wait on this game. I'm still playing ArmAII where I can fly fixed wings even in the base game. Oh yes I know...mods mods mods....ya *hangs head*",

        {
            "review_text": "This game has a ton of potential. I'm a fan of the of the Arma series, and Bohemia Interactive as a compnany. I bought Arma 3 back when it was in early access as an alpha. Back then, Bohemia was releasing regular updates that included in game content. I've become very skeptical of Steam Early Acess titles, but I trusted Bohemia Interactive as a company I have bought from before and have been happy with my purchases and received many hours of enjoyment from their previous titles. (Arma 2 and Carrier Command to name a few)   Arma 3 Eventually hit Beta, and later final release. After the 'Finalized' product was increased in price the in game content soon stopped flowing. Then the Karts DLC was released. I thought 'Oh this is just some fun thing the devs made some weekend.' I passed on it as it had a kind of high price tag for just a mini-game calibre addon. Now the Helicopter DLC came out. It costs around 16 bucks. With these helicopters came new game mechanics. You can now tow vehicles via one of the DLC helicopters. Keep in mind, Arma is a game that has an active community of modders, scripters, programmers, mappers and artists creating new content every week.  That's not to say Arma 2 didn't have its share of DLC. However, for comparable prices you got a new singleplayer campaign, a few scenarios, and an array of vehicles opposed to just two. This is the direction I don't like to see Arma go. When I bought the PMC DLC for Arma2, it felt worth it. I got more hours of gameplay by myself and singleplayer and many more options for transport and weaponry in multiplayer. The Arma3 DLC seems unfair. The two combined are offered for a reduced price, with both DLCs (around 25 dollars) You get three vehicles, (A kart and two helicopters.), a few outfits, and a starter pistol.  On top of that, this game requires pretty fancy hardware to run above a steady 30 frames. I've found that this a very processor intensive game. I recently went from an I3 processor to and I7 and now make 40 frames pretty steadily on very high or ultra. However, when flying or otherwise moving fast, I still experience some heavy frame drops. These don't make the game unplayable by any means, but they do happen somewhat frequently (usually when flying over large villages with lots of models, namely Kavala.) For CAS pilots, you're almost always flying very low to the ground, and very fast. The added frame drops increase the challenge of flying CAS in urban areas. Now for people who are using lower end processors, you'll find looking at a village, even not directly (through terrain or a building) will drop your frames by atleast five. For people controlling Zeus you'll find that lag increases very quickly for your players the more things you put onto the battlefield. It becomes apparant a lot sooner than you'd expect for a game on the scale of Arma 3. Speaking of scale, a word often used when describing the main map, Altis. Altis has a huge perfomance difference comparatively to other maps. Now, obviously, the bigger something is, the more intensive it is to render. I NEVER noticed differences in performances from Chernarus to Takistan, to Namalsk, to Zargabad, to Utes on Arma 2. Granted, Altis is a lot more urban than Takistan for instance, and to be honest, I'd rather play Takistan if I can go anywhere on it. I've been on Insurgency servers where going to Kavala is against the rules because spawning AI in there increases lag to a huge degree.  Being a finished game, Arma 3 feels a bit empty on the side of vehicles and weapons. There are TONS of outfits, but I'm pretty sure there's less than 20 guns (not counting variants) For a game as large as Arma, you'd think there would be a large array of weapons, similar to Arma2.  Aside from that, being injured and out of breath REALLY kills your aim, it doesn't really feel right to me but I can live with it.  Also, using scroll wheel as an action menu is still awkward as hell, but you get used to it. Again. I can live with it.  That's my gripe with Arma 3 right now. Here's what I like:  Otherwise, Arma 3 has great potential. The Zeus gamemode is innovation I've been looking for in gaming for a long time. It allows someone to take the role of a Dungeon Master and create the story of the mission as it proceeds. With that it is tricky to be/find a good Zeus. Once you can make a challenging, but not impossible mission for your friends, it is a blast for everyone. It's even fun to mess around by yourself as Zeus. You can create your own missions, and since the AI is good it's still challenging. I love Zeus and hope to see similar concepts in other games in the future.  Flying is very tight. Flying is as near perfect as it gets for me. I am very happy with the flying system in this game, I have not tried the advanced flying mode yet, but I imagine Bohemia put the same care and attention into it as the now standard, default mode. The land vehicles turning radiuses seem huge, but they are military vehicles.   The singleplayer story is a lot more intuitive and better paced than Arma 2. I have not beat it yet, but there have been many moments I have enjoyed. It is set up in a three part act, much like a movie, the middle being climax/dilema. The first act is rather short. Other than that, so far the campaign is much more engaging than Arma2.  The community for Arma, if you're not aware is terrific. I love being able browse for addons other users created. This allows units to personalize their gear and vehicles to better suit their playstyle (Navy, Marines, Airforce, ETC) There are tons of mods that make the game so much more involving and immersive. If you get this game, I'd say it's a must to download a few mods.  I know I said the scale is too big above, but if there's some things Arma does right, one of them is scale. When your on Altis, or Chernarus if you want something that runs better, You feel like you're in huge area, and there could be fighting ten kilometers from where you're fighting. Because of this, everything takes time. Getting a tank to a battlefield to tip the balance of the fight is a hard choice to make, because that fight could be lost by the time the tank gets there.  Gunplay and movement are silky smooth, however, balistics seems a bit off. Some enemies seem to just absorb bullets sometimes. Bohemia included modified stances so you don't have to download a mod. The modified movements are very useful.  ~~~~ Some things I don't like that aren't Bohemia's fault:  Servers feel pretty empty at the time I'm gaming, and takes a while to find a good operation.  You can no longer host a forward private server for your friends, due to the Gamespy closing, Steam took over, I don't know if they'll bring it back, but that was definitely part of the reason I got into Arma. It was very easy to pick up and do a mission with a couple of buds.  Too many Altis Life servers. ~~~~  All in all, I think Arma 3's path will change. The community got pretty upset over the helicopter DLC, and with good reasons. I like this game. I still play it today. Is it worth fifty or sixty dollars? Probably not right now. However, this game isn't by any means bad, and if you enjoy a more simulator feel when playing a first person shooter, I would say that this would be a pretty good game to get.  Bohemia, I hope you gain my trust back.  (Sorry for any typos, wrote this late at night)  ",

So much to do, guns to shoot, vehicals to drive, vehicals to FLY, and items to wear and use. I do remember my very first time ever playing, I booted up the game into altis life, and as I sat on the porch of my home, I watched as a police officer arrested 4 men in their underwear. As they all kept screaming 'APD (altis police department) IS ILLUMINATI'. And as the officers kept repeating 'NO WE ARENT SCRUBS'. As I progressed through the game, discovering new modes, maps, missions, and more, I grew a liking to king of the hill, me and my buddies would roleplay it so hard. We would sprint through the all out war field, wondering if we would make it out alive, as my head medic, takes a sniper round to the leg, and hits the ground. I looked to the sky, making sure it was clear, I saw an enemy parchuting to the ground, obviously ready to kill us, I raised my rifle, and shot, and I watched him fall to the ground, dead. I read the kill feed 'Jesus Christ was killed by Moist Potatos'. My team yelled 'YOU KILLED JESUS! RIGHT OUT OF THE SKY!' I advanced to my wounded soldier, and I stated 'youll be okay, its just one shot'. He looked me in the eye, and said, 'its okay boss, its my time, let me go in peace'. As my eyes began to water, and drip, I told him I would fill his request, and I clicked, 'Cancel Revive'. The water from my eyes splashed onto the keyboard, my palms began to sweat, and I became shaky, I yelled to my team to keep going to the objective, and I laied down next to my dead medic, and waited for the sniper round to hit, me. As the bullet landed right in my head, I went happy, I did not regret my choice. As I respawned, and I saw my medic standing at the base, I cried, again, and shot that little mother f*cker for not getting revived. So, he shot me, and I got mad, and force shut down my computer. Ill never forget that game. The game my medic puss*ed out, and turned into a lil b*tch. Ill always smile when I think of that.  11/10, this game deserves a bigger fan base than it has, it is SO worth it. Not tired of it after all these hours. Buy it.",

            "review_text": "If you are considering buying Arma 3 for the multiplayer there are a few things you should know... About the multiplayer: There are several modes of multiplayer. There's Life, which is like an role playing type scenario. There's Wasteland, which is like DayZ but without zombies. There's also the several military combat oriented multiplayer modes. Multiplayer can be rewarding, but the Arma community is extremely diverse in the way people play their game. There are some casual players, but you will also encounter real military simulation enthusists. If you like to have fun, I suggest you approach the latter group with some degree of caution. They're not all bad, but I have run into some that have Units (Arma's term for clans) that do uniform inspections, boring training and, in one case, would not admit women to their unit because it wasn't 'realistic'. Just remember, if you're not having fun then it isn't worth your time and you should immediately ditch those people that are being such a drag. Other then that, the multiplayer can get quite laggy, but you can usually find another server to play on if that's the case. And bring a book because you can expect a lot of downtime in some modes of multiplayer.  The game itself is a bit buggy. It can break your immersion at times, but when it really counts (in firefights) it rarely glitches out on me. This is a CPU intensive game. If you have a so-so processor but a good video card you may have to do some tweeks to make the game run in a satisfactory manner.  Overall, I enjoy it a bunch. There's a lot to learn and I'm quite happy with the game.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.  Eat.",

Let's have a litte summary.  +Pluses: Cool campaign, I liked it  Easy-to-use editor  Maaaaany addons for this crazy game!  The multiplayer COOP servers are cool, when you fight against other players  The gamemodes are insane  Huge, Altis map  You can find very interesting arma 3 groups (Tactical ones, either non-realistic, arcade groups)   -Minuses: Bad optimization  Completely unrealistic sway system (Me, alongside with ex. GROM solder can prove it)  Long loadtimes  I had to read about arma's tweaking like 30 minutes before I got it  Most of the servers are Epoch or Breaking Point reserved, either locked.  I don't like the idea of futuristic vehicles and helicopters. I excepted Arma 3 to be continuation of Arma 2 with better engine.  The most disappointing point: Lack of bullet chamber, just... No words to it  The bolt sniper rifles lack in reloading animations  The pistol's animations are ♥♥♥♥ed up (Just inserting the mag, no sign of pushing the lever either pulling it back to chamber the bullet)  The bots are difficult to hit, they're often OP, even after tweaking (They survive headshot, they don't pass out, they don't fall down when hit to chest, like soldier'd do IRL). Even after scored headshot, the bot is able to 360* noscope you through wall. Setting up specific mods helped.  The game doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥, it may crash random times if you won't do proper things to prevent it. Before I prevented it from crashing, I've reinstalled my system on 64 BIT, been updating the drivers instantly. Although the solution was simple (Using CCleaner and cleaning the computer from inside aswell), I didn't have the same issues with other games. I don't like the way that buildings break down. It's no good for me, it should be more realistic.    I've spent 600 hours in this game to instantly believe that it'll get better. The only thing that makes me play the game is that I've found tactical team and I play with these dudes.",

Its massive open world environment makes it an awesome combat simulator. It comes with fun stock game modes, and has a good fan base. But if you really want to have fun, I highly reccommend playing some mods, such as breaking point, battle royale, and Altis Life, to name a few.   PROS: -Large open world terrain -Challenging gameplay -There is a thrill everytime you play. It never gets old. -Good mod support -Lots of vehicles air, land and water -Realistic engine -Almost endless possibilities  CONS: -Poorly optimized. Even on my $1500.00 custom build, I still averge only about 40 FPS, dipping to 15 FPS sometimes. this is a minor problem, seeing as my average of 40 FPS is more than playable, however it is still an anoyance. -The game has its fair share of glitches. For example, sometimes I'll be driving behind one of my teammates when his truck snaps back and destroys mine, killing me in the process. Nothing happens on my teammate's screen. Many of the glitches are purley aesthetic, for example, when you die, sometimes your neck stretches out to 5x its size. A bit like BF3. -While the sounds in the game are decent, they are not exactly fantastic. To fix this, get JSRS sound mod.  Are you thinking of getting this game just for Altis life? Many people do. Thats fine, infact many of the biggest servers are altis life servers. I play on GSN's Altis Life server. It has an excellent community and friendly admins.   Overall, the game is very fun, and a massive improvement over ArmA 2. I would give it 8/10...  Thanks for reading.  ________________________________________________________________________________ UPDATE  So, after spending over 200 hours on this game, I will say this. Playing this will change you. If you are a COD player, Battlfield player, etc, you will find yourself 'not challenged' by the gameplay anymore. I've gone back to COD once or twice, and it no longer provides me with the realistic thrill that it once did. If you are in the market for realism, and a game that requires real strategy, get ARMA. Just remember, your play style must adapt. You cannot rush. You cannot spray. (Well, you can, but you will likely die and get yelled at).",

Not a normal shooter, the stuff you learned in CoD or Battlefield will not help.      A lot more fun if you join a group you can play with (large organised missions).     VERY good Dev support. There is even some support for Arma 2 OA. A very old game now.      Following on, the developers are good. They do want to help the community.      Mostly mature community (avoid roleplay servers), chances are you'll play with 16-42 year olds.   ------------------------------------------------------------------------  Are you bored of Call of Duty? Battlefield?   Where you do the same thing, over and over again. With little to no mod support?   The same small maps with invisible walls?   Play Arma 3. This is a sandbox game with an absolutely massive terrain for you to play on, no invisible walls. No black screen telling you to go back. With very good support from the developers who are more than happy to help.   The massive terrains, some of which are made by the developers, others by the userbase and the sandbox nature of the game means you can very well play for a very long time without encountering the same location and mission that you've played on before.   Mods? The developers actively support them and there are thousands of scenarios/missions/maps/vehicles and weapons waiting for you to try if you ever get bored of Vanilla.  ",

It makes missions being done by yourself without any AI or player assistance very difficult. But if you have a group of friends to help you take on some of the missions, you will enjoy this game. The multiplayer is awesome. Before I found this game, I had always been searching for a game with a gamemode that has teams with about 65 players or so each all fighting over one point. The workshop feature makes the game even better, being able to download new missions whenever you finish the ones you already have. This is overall a pretty cool game.",

I can heartily recommend the VDV-GRU if you like serious Mil-Sim experiences in a friendly enviroment, no matter your starting skill level. Be advised: we use a lot of mods, and we play as Russians, so be prepared for a lot of AK's and shooting at NATO-friendly forces. 3. Get some good mods to shape your arma Experience the way you like.  Have fun!  Sincerely, Efreitor Hansen , Bravo LMG, 1.

Fatigue actually has an effect on the game, you have to stop and catch your breath if you move too fast for the weight you caring if you want to actually hit anything. The enemy AI is intelligent, they actually get into cover when being shot at, and they have great accuracy when returning fire.  You can move freely in between infantry and mechanised roles, without loading screens. The numbers of each on you team actually have a big effect on the outcome, as well as how they are used, as most vehicles require multiple players to use them effectively, e.g. A tank needs a gunner driver and a commander to be effective.  Arma 3 improves greatly on Arma 2, and with over 300 hours spent between them I can defiantly say this game is worth buying ",

            "review_text": "Bohemia Interactive Fans have been waiting 4 years for the next instalment of their most favourite PC open world military tactical Shooter franchise, Arma 3. Tacking place on the Aegean islands of Altis and Stratis of Greece with both Islands featuring the largess terrain of 290 km2 for any Arma game, Arma has never been so open world before. The islands features over 50 renamed villages with buildings that are both penetrable and destructible. The islands also include all sorts of kinds of wild life ranging from goats to grass snakes, bunnies to butterflies and even sharks and sea turtles in the surrounding waters. The republic of Altis and Stratis is populated by 5 unique factions that includes NATO and CSAT alongside the local AAF, FAIA gorillas and the civilian population. Each faction has their own motives, characteristics, vehicles and weapons.  Arma 3 contains over 20 Vehicles including tanks, cars, helicopters, aircraft and quads that can be driven by players in the game. Plus, there is a selection of over 40 weapons to choose from that can be customised with their own types of scopes and other various types of attachments. Each type of weapons has its own handling, sway and recoil meaning that a Sub Machine gun is much easy to handle at close range then a sniper rifle. Arma 3 is so tactical, it features 15 types of stances that can be very useful in exposing the least amount of your body to the enemy. Although, Arma 3 has realistic ballistic penetration physics depending on weapon type, attachments, material, calibre and distance meaning that hiding behind a wooden fence or plaster wall may not really be a suitable type of cover. In Arma 3 you will have to be careful about how much weight you’re caring which can have effect on stamina. Arma 3 features a realistic night sky which can be useful when you are lost on Altis without a compass as the stars can be used to navigate. There is reasons why so many military veterans are into the Arma franchise.    “Arma 3 makes Call of Duty look like a kid’s game.”    If you’re a new player to Arma 3 and are intimidated by the large amount of complexity to such a realistic open world military tactical Shooter then you can start off with boot camp. Recently introduced in a free update it offers up a single payer tutorial campaign and virtual reality training topics.  Arma 3's multiplayer is where the game really shines. Servers can have up to 100 players in all out warfare. Other than the vanilla game modes there is a bunch of community made game modes including the very popular DayZ zombie survival game mode. Arma 3 comes with a free DLC called Zeus which can be used create multiplayer scenarios from a birds eye view perspective. Arma 3 content creators also can easily create and save multilayer scenarios by using the in game scenario editor in a matter of minutes. Arma 3 content can be shared and downloaded over the steam workshop with over 10,000 scenarios and addons that have been published and is growing each day. There have been Arma 3 content creation contests with prizes veering from €20,000 to €200,000.  Arma 3's new graphic engine unleashes the full potential of PC gaming. Fans will notice that the new real virtuality 4 engine Is great improvement over Arma 2's engine implementing all sorts of new changes with significant improvements to animations and sounds, combined with the introduction of Microsoft directx 11 and Nvdia physX™, the battlefields of Arma have never felt more real. However Despite being the 4th version of the real virtuality engine it’s still heavily based on the decade old Bohemia Interactive real virtuality game engine that is known for its poor optimisation leading to poor performance making it very demanding on PC hardware, epically when there are allot of AI’s.  Arma 3 Averages reviews of 9/10 (55,000 being positive and only 6,000 negative) on steam. You can download the game now at a standard selling price of $39.99 USD off steam. Although, a steam sale would put a huge discount on the standard sale price if you choose to wait for one. I would recommend getting the Apex Edition as it’s come with all the DLC’s and the just recently released Apex expansion which is currently 20% of. With the game being constantly updated and having constant flow of community made content, the game is a must buy for any PC gamer. As expected for any Arma game it requires a very beathy gaming PC with both a powerful Graphics Card and processor so we recommend that you make sure that your system is well over the games system requirements before you make your purchase. A PC with an Intel core i7 processor and a strong graphic card along the lines of an Nvdia GTX 970 or AMD r9 390 would be an ideal system for Arma 3. Installing Arma 3 on an SSD would also lead to much faster loading times.    Pros   - Open world with eye dropping graphics - Realistic tactical Shooter - Amazing campaign that reliably produces stories - Large Varity of over 20 vehicles including tanks, cars, helicopters, aircraft and quads that can be driven by players in the game - Selection of over 40 weapons to choose from that can be customised with their own types of scopes and other various types of attachments - 15 types of stances that be very useful in exposing the least amount of your body to the enemy - Realistic weapon Ballistics - Servers can have up to 100 players in all out warfare - Community made content   Cons   -Highly PC system demanding -poorly optimised game engine",

Ex: Yesterday I'm playing Arma 3 (Bennys CTI mode), I have 7 M4 Scorchers all parked at HQ with 1 gunner in each. The plan is to sneak in at about 500m from the objective, use the M4s to eliminate all opposition, then take the objective single handed while the rest of the team is attacking another objective. I hire a quadbike w/driver, assign the driver as Green Team and jump on the back. I tell him to move to the next town, and I open the map to select my best approach to the objective. After selecting my approach I go back to 3rd person view. We are about 10m past our HQ. The AI is crashing into a small rock on the side of the road. Over and over and over and over and over and over again. To my left there is apx. 10m of wide open road. :S   All I can say is WTF. A statement, not a question. WTF. Not WTF?. WTF. Get it. Anyways good game. No other game is as extensive as Arma. I would even call it more a 'sim' than a game. Not a true sim, but a sim none the less.",

I'm not going to write too much, just a few selected points that I want to highlight.  - Great, engaging and helpful community - The Singleplayer portion is pretty good too (surprised by this personally) - Incredible amount of content thanks to Steam Workshop - The level of realism is staggering, and keeps surprising me. - Graphics are beautiful! - Sounds are so realistic it's scary at times.   One warning: The games is pretty demanding (I can keep it somewhat steady at 35-40 fps on high settings with a i7 4770k, GTX 770, 16 gb ram).

There is also the Life mod but i dont care about them sooo... yeah go play it for yourself.

The rest of my teammates in the building were running low on ammo as well and the enemies were closing in. We called for someone to bring a hellicopter from out base to extract us and bring us back to base so we can rearm. Then some one said 'hold on guys im on my way!' After a few minutes our ammo was dangerously low and we hear our chopper coming. I saw him drop off 5 other players who immidiatly engaged the other team. 'ok go go go!' yells one of my teammates. We all ran out of the tower in a crouched sprint towards the chopper with bullets flying everywhere. I finally made my way to the helle safe as well as my other treamates. Whiule watching everyone run to the chopper i see two of my teammates get dropped. One just yelled 'dont worry about me just go!' The back of the chopper closed and we took off headed back to base to rearm. NO OTHER VIDEO GAME CAN PUT YOU UNDER THAT MUCH STRESS! And I loved every second of it!

First off, this game, in all actuality, is more of a sandbox, and a gaming platform, with a military theme than it is anything else. People will fanboy out and say that this is a hardcore military simulator bla bla bla, but really it is what you make it, and it depends on how you play and who your playing with. For example, like survival based games? Wasteland! Into roleplaying as police or rebels, Altis life. Like large scale team on team pvp? King of the Hill by Sa-Matra. Like the hardcore military aspect arma has to offer? Find a good tacsim clan. And there are quite a few. The thing about ArmA is it is designed as more of a platform for things to be developed on, such as the mods that the wonderful community has designed. In our clan we use quite a few mods ranging from sound mods that add more realistic and adrenaline pumping sound effects, to weapon and vehicle packs to give us weapons used in real life by the military units that we essentially try to recreate.   The problem with some people is that they expect bohemia to add all of these features and what not such as a medical system, or more realistic this and that, but the problem is if they did things like that the entire community would be effected, not just say the military simulator players of arma, and at that not all clans wish to play the same way, so if ArmA added say a much more realistic medical system, some clans wouldn't like that and it may mess up there playstyle, which is where mods come in, so clans can adjust there gameplay to how they see fit.  Overall this game is amazing, I have spent many hours playing on our tactical realism server, and i have spent MANY hours up all night with friends in skype and teamspeak on wasteland servers, playing with extreme military tactics in a post apoc. world gathering gear and taking out any and all contacts. This game has the pontential to bring you hours upon hours of entertainment. Forget all the complaints of 'lack of this and needs more that' b.s. This game can be what you make of it and most of us have chosen to enjoy it! There are some amazing things being devoloped for this game such as the A.L.I.V.E. mod which adds a very realistic living breathing ArmA world where enemies have there own objectives and behave like real humans being controlled with real tactics and objectives in mind. Things like that make this game amazing and I expect to be playing it for many years to come. I've been with it since the first month of alpha and it never ceases to get more and more amazing weather it's updates to the engine, or updates from the large and amazing community.   There is so much that I can't even begin to cover in this game but from the experienced I have had in this game, it is easily my favorite game of all time, even though it may have some querks here and there, it is amazing - 10/10.",

You can make either a hostage situation or rise up against a city and take power for once and for all.  THe graphics in this game are simply amazing. Though, you must have a beasty computer to have Okay FPS. If you lower the settings it will be very harsh on your CPU but as the graphics go up the intensity on the gpu goes up. So that could really be improved on in the next Arma.  The DLC's are amazing. Helicopter, giving you a huge variety of helicopter of your choice to fly around the insanely large maps to conquer. Marksmen, be the best sniper in town and pick people off from hundreds of metres away. Karts, If you want to have a bit of fun and drive around in your mini go cars and mess around with people. Always a laugh... Tanoa, a Insane new jungle mape with improved helicopters and unmanned vehicles, oh and new kalashnikovs, what could be better. Though unfortunately the price, too high Bohemia!  The game is amazing with some aspects of the game being a let down.  Here are my ratings,  Graphics 8.5/10 Realism 9.5/10 Maps 8/10 Gameplay (Feel of the game) 8.5/10 Campaign 6/10 Editor 9/10 Guns 10/10 Sounds 10/10 Variety 8/10 Communication 10/10  Overall: 87.5 Great Game!",

What you really need to do is join servers that are running gamemodes such as Domination, and coordinate with your entire team. Keep in mind that Arma 3 is nothing like Battlefield or Call of Duty because you have to pay attention to the global picture of the entire map rather than just what you are currently aiming at. You have to talk to your squad, even if it is people you don't even know very well, because everyone contributes to the well being of the squad. All in all, Arma 3 is an extremely fun game as long as you play it correctly.",

For instance, the rebels would often only have RPG's or any anti-tank weapons as compared to tank on tank battles. So this forced you to set up ambushes.  However, in this game, it's got a-lot more of a guns away attitude. Very few people (Unless in Wasteland) actually communicate, because they don't need to.  BUT go and buy it if you want a tense and action packed multiplayer, but for the more tacitcal players, I would advise staying away.",

            "review_text": "This is going to be a pretty long review of ArmA 3 so lets get started. ArmA 3 is an open world Military simulator, designed to capture real war. And it does this fairly well. But I cannnot recommend the game for the following reasons.   Firstly we will start with the Pros and then the Cons.      Pros:         ArmA3 is set on either Stratis, Altis or Tanoa depending if you purchased the DLC or not. Stratis is a good small map with good positions for setting up interesting military operations same with Altis. Tanoa is a Fujian like terrain with many trees and bushes allowing for jungle type warfare scenarios which is both interesting and engauging.       The game is highly moddable you can write scripts to add new functionality or create models that create new types of gameplay. Such as new weapons or vehicles. The engine is powerful in terms of versitility but not so great in other aspects.       Vehicle,uniforms and weapon content is quite wide in terms of what you get for the base game but all the other DLCs add a fair bit more than what the base game offers including a new jungle type map.       The game is visually appealling with post processing effects including 16bit HDR and Your basic bloom effects. It also has high resolution textures for all vehicles players and objects.      There exists a pretty wide range of game mode variation from Invade &amp; Annex to KoTH all the way to GTA remake called Altis Life.      The games weather is a real testiment to what TrueSky can do it's beautiful the sky along with the cloud and weather effects. combined withe HDR the game comes quite close to actual real life sky colouring. Coupled with the weather effects sound improvements that game with Tanoa eliminated the tin sounding thunder claps.        Cons:         Game suffers extreme bottlenecks in the rendering loop with super-sampling. A resolution of 200% set in ArmA 3 results in a massive drop in videocard usage. to nearly 28% This is probably due to ArmA 3 not feeding enough work to the videocard as a result the videocard is always waiting for an update.      Game depends on single core clock performance because of how the threading model works. Simply put the game main thread sit on a single core with worker threads sent to other cores, those worker threads report back to the main thread so in the instance that a worker thread is in the geometry rendering or texture rendering the main-loop is in a wait-state for the sub-threads to report back their status as a result CPU and GPU usage drop like a brick.       Artificial Intelligence is definitely not intelligence the AI are smart enough to aimbot you thats about it and you have to use external scripts to fix something that should already be in place. I mean tab into zues and they have a missile reticle on your player behind a build / tree. They drive and are as smart as your little toys you used to have as a kid that would crash into a wall turn randomly in 1 direction then move forward and repeat. Half the time never actually getting around the obstacle      The community is rude and generally arrogant, you ask certain questions and they will attack your coding because you did 1 thing wrong instead of actually pointing out the problem they bash what you did. They are certainly not real programmers in any respect.       The scripting engine is yes versitile and functional but thats about it. Many nuances exist in the scripting engine and documentation for it is dismal and lacking. Edited by the community through much trial and error. And assumed functionality from previous experience. Python or Lua which Lua is more commmonly found in other games as a script API are known to have very good documentation as they are so wide spread SQF on the other hand is a mess a god damn mess.       Networking wise the game doesn't scale beyond 40 - 50 players depending on the server, but in general for example KoTH with all it's server-side mod components and client side it still suffers massive FPS drops when clients get close together ArmA 3 is a military simulator engine is people repeatedly try to treat it like GTA or an MMO type game engine which it is not, and so performance overall suffers considerably when we get &gt; 50 players online.       Mods don't follow a standard of work, as such anyone can publish ArmA 3 mods, even if they may contain catastrophic bugs that lead to memory leakage in the sense of external dlls or scripts.       Scripts also don't follow a standard of work, standardisation is almost non-existent in game and people often slap scripts together and hope for the best. Without considering the consequences of that script.      Code theft and thievery is rampant 1 community develops something the other has to steal it from that community. People also try to threaten about code supposably owned by previous communities which it is only owned by them if money was to change hands and or contracts were signed which if they were not would not matter by default you own the code rights.       Apex DLC is only worth the money if you only care about the map the map is the most interesting part of Tanoa thats about it.       Many missions are highly toxic and encourage disgusting gameplay behaviour and the related. wasteland,Altis Life and KoTH are just mere reincarnations of Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty and DayZ modification. May as well be.       Gameplay becomes boring an uninteresting after being both drained by the communities and the script engine not cooperating for whatever undocumented stupid reason.       The wiki documentation is a mess a total mess certain pages re-route to completely unrelated pages repeatedly, with a nesting effect there is no class inheritence or order, the wiki is mostly chaotic and messy.       Communiities have a real sense of entitlement just because you wrote it you should share it, this is not the case. With the above stated 'theivery' of code. People feel they deserve it in the community because of knowledge they contributed to the wiki etc. They are entititled to sweet f.a .     Thats just my little breakdown and rant about how bad the game is and it's problems. If bohemia were to fix the framerate problems many people experience from people with I7-6700K at 4.0Ghz to I7-5820K at 3.3 Ghz then I might consider it recommedable, but this game is still suffering framerate problems 2 years since it's release. The community hasn't cleaned up it's act and the game still does poor usage of videocard resources it should be using a lot more. The engine is old and archiac and requires both 64bit addressing in order to help the large maps without having to stream the data by dynamically loading and unloading data on the fly to get around the 32bit memory problem. 64bit memory would also allow more resources to be utilised because more threads often require more RAM. For each of their instances.        This is my first and last Bohemia game I will buy    ",

            "review_text": "This game has outstanding potential hidden inside it. Over ArmA 2 and Arrowhead, both graphics, features and gameplay has improved significantly. Unfortunately, cannot say the same thing about performance.  Not only you need a beast of a PC to run it at a decent framerate on singleplayer, on multiplayer, that thousands of dollars worth PC won't help you, since it's completely down to the server hardware. Every AI unit you add to the battle might and will impact your framerate. If there are 30 units, kiss 10 frames goodbye. If there are 100 units, that will sum up to at least 20 frames.  Engine itself, is heavily dependent on CPU and by that I mean it's clock speeds. At this moment, AI runs on the main game/server thread to combat any desynch in multiplayer in turn, tickrate hits the dirt. Considering game is not multi-core optimized at all, neither Hyperthreading nor Octacores will help you. If you do not have a Nvidia card and you are planning to run the game with a CPU that's a little better than what's recommended, don't bother, it will slice 10 from your frames, culprit, PhysX. Even with the top of the line CPU and GPUs in SLI, do not dream about anything over 60 frames on a populated CO-OP, Single Player or Multiplayer mission. You WILL get dips below 40 at times.  Graphic settings won't impact your frames much, as long as you reduce CPU hogging settings such as clouds and drawdistance, you can run the game at ultra without much of an issue. Framerate impact is completely because of CPU under utilization.  Mechanics are amazing, gunplay is exceptional. AI can be extremely clever and they communicate, flank, use supports and can make your life a misery if you aren't situationally aware. Single player is extremely interesting and mission editor gives unlimited content possibilities. On development branch, Introduction of Zeus DLC wasn't in vain. It's such a great addition. Consider it as a more user friendly mission editor that comes with the game plus, you can adjust EVERYTHING in real time. It will make you forget about the performance.  For $35.99, it's a good package. But if you aren't really into such a game, I say wait for a better discount.",

To truly appreciate the realism and immersion of Arma 3 you have to find a good server to play on. I have not played a game in recent memory that provides the realism that this one does and the community is really the driving force behind that. The gameplay is solid, but the learning curve is somewhat larger than your average shooter. Combat is not in your face, but tends to be long range engagements that last a significant amount of time. The single player options are decent, and provide a good means for learning the game, but you should not buy this game if you are looking for a single player experience. My only other significant complaint is how poorly optimized this game is. It is a pretty game, very pretty actually, but it runs so poorly on even decent rigs that it can become quite frustrating. 7.5/10",

That has nothing to do with the quality of the game but more down to me having a vast library of 'life vacuum' games.  They have incorporated so much into this game but sadly have arrived in the form of DLC. Luckily I didn't pay that much for the game first time around. It is always a pleasure being able to play a game built purely for PC. As the spin off MODS available are astounding and with such an active community you are never going to get bored of this game. The core engine on A3 is much improved and offers some fantastic postures and firing positions. So no longer are window ledges too high or some walls that little bit too high to fire from. You can adjust your posture to accomodate this.  Multiplayer is obviously where this game really shines and there are a plethora of servers out there for you to really fit into. We used to run our own server with a very unique way to playing the game and triewd to keep it SF orientated with few air assets on call or artillery. It now seems some gaming clans or servers have taken this a step further some are very rigid and disciplined. This allows the game to be played as it should be played. If you don't fall inline or just like to blow the base up and annoy everybody else then expect a ban. You get assigned to a fireteam with a TL. Your TL talks to High Command for your orders. Then you line up for deployment with a dedicated Helo pilot to drop you on Target. Great fun and ordered. That is just one game mode developed by the community and the organisation of a clan.  The modern setting isn't really my bag but it does work. I prefer current as opposed to future. However there are lots of mods out there to sort that out.",

I'm biased to say this 'cause my favorite style of playing is sniper but... Now back to its cons, The biggest failing of this game in my opinion is not being optimized 'cause there's no excuse for that, you know there's a myriad of games with huge maps that are optimized and you can clock them easily. Hope the company that's made this game come out an update to optimize it, or at least optimize the next arma.

But other than that you should be just fine with making friends upon mods like exile or Epoch. As a advanced Heli Pilot for my squad i dropped 50$ on a joy stick and love it to death this game has so many feature to put you at a higher advantage than other's but when it boils down to your PvP its all skill from there the zeroing is pretty realistic and has the feel of a sniper sitting out at 1,200 meters from his targets and watch them drop as you cover your squad as they breach the building. I introduced the game to a couple of my friends they gave it a try and now I play it with them every day. Engaging situations with your team is fun as well, As you must have great communication and reation time to complete your task. for the price goes 60$USD is for sure worth it but i'd pick it up on sale just so you can get the DLC as well. for PC specs the game doesn't take much to run Don't need a beast build to play this game to look nice.

Umm.. yeah, I can really recommend this game to everyone who is looking for a realistic (no, let's not say realistic, instead simulating reamlisme) This game is trying really hard to simulate realisme, which to be fair it does pretty decent aswell.. Of course you can never really make a game that is totally realistic, but this does the job for me at least. I'd say the campaign is decent, way better than the games before it though. I play mainly altis life, where I meet lots of friends and people who stole my kidney. There is not that many TDM servers though, mostly german ones. But plenty of CooP servers (I recommend '=7Cav=' Coop server) Umm yeah, the inventory-UI is wastly improved and is a lot more easy to use. Also there is a ton of new 'combat stances' which can come in handy if the fence you are hiding behind is to low to prone or too tall to crouch behind. The AI... is um really like it's always been stupid and careless but once they spot you from like over 1000m they are able to hit you like it was nothing, that can be a bit a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes, but hey.. Don't get this game for singleplayer experience go buy this game, go to multiplayer and search for some 'Altis life' 'Wasteland' servers.

The campaign is really good, there is nothing wrong with it at all except from where I find it hard at some cases. But overall it holds a realistic simulation of how its like.  I also love multiplayer on Arma III. People can transform CO-OP gamemodes to a realistic enviroment in multiplayer, like some people can form squads and they like to make it look like a real squad which contains planning, tatical, commands, things like that. It makes the game look real. Arma III was released 7 months ago but grows a better game each time. There are certain amount of bugs and glitches in it but its very rare the bugs or glitches occur....  The game is quite expensive I know, its 35.99 but its good to spend money on a brilliant game like this. If you want to spend more on it you can buy Digital Deluxe Upgrade for 8.99. I recommend buying the Deluxe Edition for 39.99, make sure you like what you are buying of the Deluxe Edition. When you buy this game I hope you have alot of fun. Thanks!   ",

The reality factor is unbelievable (yes yes some things still need work, like tire explosions and some vehicle control but it's the best it gets so far). All the aspects they need to improve aren't a big deal because they have a huge and amazing developer's team which keeps releasing amazing updates and HUGE DLC's and bunch of extra content.   Honestly, you don't need to read any review unless you're looking for very specific detail. Watch their promo video heree and go on their forums to learn the most. You don't need to read a lengthy review to know this is one of the best games ever made. GET IT GET IT GET IT. Do NOT wait for it to drop in price (it does here and there) Just get the Digital Deluxe Edition and all of the DLC's. You spend 50-60 bucks on games which you beat in under 100 hours or even under 20 hours. You'll spend $100-$200 on ArmA3 but expect HUNDREDS and THOUSANDS of game time. There is ALWAYS something new to do. TONS of game types and OMG if you play with a friend or let alone a LAN party, that's the best it gets, it's so much fun. An amazing community consisted of military enthusiasts and active soldiers and veterans as well as Emergency Response personnel like Fire Fighters, Police Officers and Paramedics. Why does it matter? Becaause these men and women know how to takeand give orders. How to make a simulator like ArmA feel as if you're actually in there. Just do yourselves a favor. Stop saving for whatever you're saving, stop reading this and go buy the game. Then start saving again :)   My Rating: 9.5/10 I know it's tough to make everything perfect but things like vehicle and aircraft control need to feel a bit more real (most of them do but some are just so frustrating) also little things like when your tire blows up, it shouldn't just disappear lol... That's why you didn't get a full 10/10. Those small things, really do matter. Some people will hate on me for saying that but I am sorry, many would agree with me. I couldn't give it less than 9.5/10 because even though they still need some work on some objects in the game, it's the best I have ever seen, ever. Nothing get's this real and collaborative. The team play in this game is unbelievably crucial for success. Most of the time it's plain suicide to go solo. This is as real as it gets (behind a computer monitor). Have fun.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

            "review_text": "Here's the thing about ARMA: it is what you and the people you play with make it. Nothing more and nothing less. This has always been the case with the ARMA series.   The vanilla game with no mods is decent if you have a group of friends to play it with, boring if you don't. The mod community is enormous and most people play versions that are modded in some way. This ranges from relatively small quality-of-life changes like ACE to total conversions like Exile and Epoch. The game can be an ultra hardcore milsim or a somewhat more arcadey (but still with a lot of realistic elements) shooter. The game can be hilariously buggy at times. 90% of your playtime, it will be stable, and a lot the bugs are caused by mods, but you will encounter them even in vanilla.  In multiplayer, this game is VERY INTENSIVE ON SERVER HARDWARE. It takes a beast of a server with a beast of a connection to host 50+ people with no lag. A lot of server owners don't set their population limits appropriately and you end up with laggy servers when they get full. You might have to look around for a server that's set up properly for the number of people allowed on it. You won't have to look terribly far, though, and once you find some good servers, the multiplayer is great.  I'll mainly address the quality of simulation, since that's what ARMA is primarily intended to be. Mods are very much personal-preference based and outside the control of the developer so it wouldn't be fair to go on about them too much.  World Simulation: Very good. The engine includes a host of robust options for simulating weather, and the weather affects the world and your ability to fight in it in predictable, realistic ways. Fog creeps up from valleys in the morning like you would expect it to, for example. The simulation does fall short, however, when you consider how the weather affects the ground; there's no struggling through mud after a heavy rain, but that is something that no modern engine of which I am aware can currently achieve.  Infantry Simulation: Excellent. Ballistics are calculated appropriately, first-focal-plane reticles graduated in milliradians can be used to estimate range and hold-over properly. Terminal projectile performance when penetrating barriers, body armor, and previously living tissue can occasionally be a bit off, but mostly functions as one might expect in reality. Glancing or multiple ricochets can be downright wonky but don't have a huge effect on the game since most of their energy is spent on the bounce. Occasionally a bullet will hit a helmet at just the right angle to glance off instead of deliver what would have been a headshot, which can be realistic or not depending on the exact circumstances. Infantry is the most realistically simulated part of the game and has clearly had the most time spent on it.  Air Vehicle Simulation: Good. Be warned, all flight models are simplified. If you're into flying, it's not going to be as close to reality as DCS or Flight Sim X are, but those are dedicated flight sims. Fixed-wing aircraft work just fine. CAS has to coordinate with infantry on the ground to be effective. Air superiority can be a little underwhelming. As a pilot, most of your time will likely be spent in rotary-wing aircraft, either as air support or as a transport pilot. Rotary wing flight models are very simplified and don't factor the finer aspects of rotary-wing aviation such as ground effect and translational lift, and they barely acknowledge rotor torque, but they are otherwise passable. The big challenge for aviation in ARMA comes from knowing how to use your aircraft appropriately and make tactical decisions with your approaches, rather than the actual act of flying.  Ground Vehicle Simulation: Passable. Ground vehicles function just fine, if not in a completely realistic manner. The main issue is that they can take damage from very strange sources when you wreck them into something. For example, crashing an ATV into the wrong type of bush at relatively low speed can cripple the vehicle and nearly kill you, but encountering a small construction fence at the same speed can simply knock the fence over while you continue on your way. As long as you aren't wrecking, the vehicles otherwise behave in fairly predictable ways in terms of encountering small-arms fire, mines, IEDs, and larger ordnance.  Sea Vehicle/Diving Simulation: Passable. Honestly, there's not much reason to go in the water on the current maps in ARMA, but it includes a lot of options for interacting with the water such as submarines, boats, wetsuits, and chest-mounted rebreathers like the ones used by Navy SEALS. The depth of simulation kind of ends there, with no provision for breathing gas mixes or operating depth considerations on the rebreather, which is stated to be a pure-oxygen variant and as such would be fatal at depths of 20 feet and below. On Altis and Stratis, the world below sea-level is well finished, there's just sadly not much reason to go there. Underwater controls can be a little awkward but usable.  AI Simulation: Borderline to poor. The AI are fairly dumb regardless of difficulty setting. Difficulty is increased by allowing the AI to cheat more and more. The end result is that the most 'difficult' AI will do things like spot you through a building with xray and aimbot you through the wall. If I had to choose one aspect that Bohemia really needs to work on for future installments, the AI is it.  In conclusion, I recommend ARMA 3 if you have some buddies to play it with or are willing to find some. It's a solid milsim, or a pretty solid whatever-you-want-to-make-it-through-mods. The game depends very much on interaction with others, however, and the odds are if you get it for a single-player experience, you won't enjoy it too much.  UPDATE:  Post-Apex, ARMA 3 remains very much what you make it. The mod community is huge and varied, tons of servers are available for vanilla and modded games, and the base game is still great at its core. The occasional bug still rears its ugly head, but there are far fewer of them than there were even a year ago, and they tend to not be as potentially gamebreaking.",

Bar none, the BEST military simulation on the PC that is available to the public and priced under $10000  Yes there are flight sims that do flight more realistic, there are tank sims that do tanks more realistic, etc, etc, etc. However, there are no other games that combine ALL the aspects of a military simulation in one full package like the Arma series does.  Arma III is the continuation of the Arma series, which started out as 'Operation Flashpoint 1985'. OPF1985 was considered the best of it's time when it was released and the Arma series has continued that tradition with many of the same developers that created OPF1985.  With a simple quick mission builder, a full blown complex high-end mission editor, mods, mods, and even more mods to make Arma III something really special to those of us who enjoy these type of games.  If you want the same feature set, but more realistic you would have to actually be in the military and have a security clearance and thousands of dollars. But you can get close to the same thing that real militaries around the world actually train with for less than $60 and you don't need to sign-up for service.  If you want to enjoy this, but can't afford it at full price or have an older or slower PC, then Arma II almost as chock full of features and mods so if you can't get this, get Arma II.",

Number one, its engaging and immersive and fun, and number two is the fact that Bohemia Interactive cares about its modding community (Hence the competition 'Make ArmA, not war'). But ArmA 3 comes with a few flaws. Chief among these, in my opinion, is optimization as I own a very good mid-level PC and I seem to be getting around 16 to 20fps. Also is the lack of vehicles and weaponry, although I know that is set to change, I would have liked the game to be complete and not an 'about to finish up Beta'. But if you have some friends that are interested, then why don't you visit the islands of Altis and Stratis. Live a new life in Altis or Stratis Life, fight for survival in Wasteland, or work together to defeat OPFOR AI in Invade and Annex. Just bare in mind that this is a Military simulator, so no run and gun or Rendezook's here, just good ol' fashioned tactical warfare.",

The Altis Life RPG mod, for example, is the best game mode I've ever played. Bohemia have factored almost everything into this, and made so much attention to detail. It's purely amazing.  Although made on a 7 million budget, this is way better than any other game on the market. Of course, it's confusing. But, it optimizes everything. Every key on your keyboard does something, every animation has so much detail, and the configuration settings are amazing. Even if your PC isn't the best, you'll still be able to run this fine. Which brings me to my next point, the engine was made to be clunky, so you can run this game at 25+ FPS and it's quite tolerable.   The only problem I've found is it runs in 16-bit colour mode when running on borderless windowed. But that is nothing compared to how great the game actually is. I have spent a small 60 hours playing this, 57 of which were in the past two weeks, according to my Steam profile, at the time I wrote this review. I have had so much fun in this. Just as I was about to leave gaming altogether, I bought this for 60 AUD. I don't regret it.   In essence, if you have friends to play with, and a half-decent computer, you will have so much fun on this game. I recommend it to everyone. This absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥ on Arma 2, DayZ and any other type of game of similarity.",

            "review_text": "Short and skinny: Don't buy this if you are looking for an alternative to the 'Big 2' AKA: COD/BF series. It has never been that, and never will be. This is mistake #1 with this series/style of sim/game. People say 'How is it compared to BF/COD?' It's the dead wrong question to ask.  Preface/General: Now that aside, this is a simulator for it to be 'what you want it to be'. Think again more of a brutal sandbox mode game for either single or multiplayer. It doesn't hold hands, there is not much for a indication on how you die...you just die. Now keep in mind, you might travel from 5min to 30min, or even more to a target area in a sandbox like this without even seeing an enemy/pulling the trigger, and things can be 'randonized'....and if you screw up, or even if you do things perfect/to the book, you still might 'insta die' because you were in the wrong place/wrong time...much like real war. That's brutal to a lot of people who in turn ask the question of 'Where is the fun in that?!' To that, I'd say 'It's what you make of the experience, what you feel if you do acomplish someting in it.'   Performance: My experiences have always been that this sim always runs incredibly better for 'single player performance' for it's built in missions, or user generated download missions/etc. There are infinite downloads for user generated content, or you can easily make your own 'what if' missions. Again, you need to think 'hardcore BIG sandbox'.   Multiplayer: Can be very fun, but user beware it's not for the faint of heart. If you are looking for a instant 'run and gun' like the intro mentioned titles, you are going to hate the expereince. It's not that at all. The community is more 'niche' and if you don't care for that, this is not your game/sim. Also, mutiplayer is way more taxing on your system for performance generally speaking depending on the mission/group size. Your mileage may vary. It does also support Track IR5 for those flight sim folks wanting that for your infantry control as well which is almost a must for a hardcore sim like this.  GUNS GUNS GUNS: Ballistics are modeled to be as close to possible as the real thing. This means gravity drop/pattern spreads, ballistic modeling for impact on various things. It's a simulator. That being said...so many people have become 'conditioned' to 'balance/fairness' for multiplayer aspects. IE: In those FPS games they will adjust/nerf/improve guns based on player feedback and perfomance, largly due to map constraints in the sake of 'balance' vs 'realism'. That's not here. It's all just math in a sandbox. To some people, that is great, to others...a nightmare of people screaming 'SRAW IS OP!/GUN X IS OP!'. Balance and 'fairness' is not why you play a simulation though. Also bear in mind it's quite common to have fire fights on some areas of 500m or more apart on some areas, so again this is where people might not be used to long range tactical combat. Every weapon in ARMA is usefull and you will be more concerned about your SQUAD loadout vs your own. It's not a lone wolf game, and there are not 'stats/unlocks'.  How is it VS 'fill in the blank?': Think of this in this comparison. DCS-A10C is more akin to the Arma series, vs say BF/COD/Ace Combat. They all share only one common item 'War based'. Other than that, they are VERY different experiences. Games like BF/COD, you will litterally be pulling the trigger, or dieing within seconds of spawning in, and if you die, the respawn timers are either non existant, or a short few seconds...it's insta action at it's core, as well as those titles having VERY enclosed maps vs scale of Arma maps. Arma, you will be at a base, and it could be 5-45 minutes depending on a wild spectrum on things whether single player or multiplayer. Some people can't handle traveling more than 10 minutes to a target/engagement area before becoming bored, or will rage quit if they get killed instantly by not using cover. There is no 'red flash, retreat to cover'....generally speaking in comparison to FPS's mentioned above. Depends on what you got hit by, and where. 9/10 you're going to be insta killed. This forces VERY tactical cautious team based game play...because who wants another 5-15 minute trip from home base back to the action?  I play both DCS, ARMA, and BF series, and they each have their time and place. Comparing them is hard to do as they are truly not the same genre really. The biggest buyer remorse with series like these (ARMA/DCS) is people go into them expecting an 'alternative' to a mainstream BF/COD/Ace Combat play style, only to then find out they stepped into an entirely different genre of game/sim play style.  Like others have said....'should you buy it?'  If you want a brutal infantry/ground vehichle (primarily infantry) sandbox large scale map simulation with lots of modding options=Absolutley. If you want a harcore 'flight sim': No, buy DCS instead. Flight mechanics here are more simish than BF, but not even close to DSC series. You buy ARMA more so for the infantry combat aspect. If you want an alternative to BF/COD/MOH: Absolutlety not. It's not the same genre of software at all. I know all the screenshots and user videos can make it 'appear so'...but the reality is that it doesn't play like that at all.",

            "review_text": "This game is plagued with awful optimization issues that make the game practically unplayable in certain mods. For example, in Wasteland, one of the more popular mods out there, the game will literally crash my entire PC every 10-15 mins. I do not have this problem with any other game and have run stress tests on my PC several times. Arma has had optimization issues since Alpha and this really needs to be looked at for Radeon card owners like me (HD 6870). I've done everything from reinstalling drivers to amping up the fan speed to maintain at a very reasonable 60C. Chances are you won't run into this problem. But then again you might and if you do, you're in for a world of frustration. I don't have problem is most other modes. This game is very finnicky and like I said there are some optimization issues as people with weaker specs may be able to run the game better than someone who meets/exceeds recommended specs.  Most of my friends have also experienced a couple of crashes in their time with Arma 3. So crashes are not at all a rare occurence in Arma from my experience.  Do I recommend this game? Hard to say. Mods like Wasteland and City Life are what really make this game worthwhile and there's a half decent campaign going for it. Grab it at a discount but don't pay full price.  Overall: 7.5/10",

If this game had the money of BF4 or CoD it would blow them out of the water. Team coms and work mixed with the pure massive size of the maps work well.  The other large draw is the mods. Where else can I cook meth, have a shootout, steal a helicopter, get away. Then take out the herion dealers with the helicopter. Lose it in the fight and be gunned down after running 2 miles trough a mountain trying to avoid a manhunt. Almost anything or scenario that is avaiable IRL can be set up in here.

You can use tanks, apc's, helicopters, boats, submarines, cars, jets, UAV's, rocket launchers, machine guns, grenades, command troops, and a whole bunch more.  Q. And game modes? A. There is a campaign with a storyline, there are single scenarios you can play, there is multiplayer with all kinds of co-op or competitive gameplay and there is even a mission editor and extensive mod support.

Great job, Bohemia!!!!!  -Arma 3 APEX:  I, in all my countless of hours playing this series under various names since the year of our lord 2000, have never been so highly impressed with the work done for a single map, and cannot, I stress, CANNOT, say enough high praises for the latest campaign that came with the initial APEX release. Particularly the 'Hearts of Darkness' mission.  Pros: -use of lighting is just fantastic, mind blowing at times.   -Overall graphics feel well optimized,(finally) with continuous 60fps on ultra settings and high vis disance (machine specs at end)  -Again, accolades to the lighting team- when used properly its so close to real its staggering  -the preconfigured campaign with it respawn feature make this combat simulator a little freindlier for MP play  -The campaign is well done mechanically, that is to say the gameplay missions are fun and challenging, with plenty of replayability.  -Added set of new vehicles, elements, items, you name it. Very comprehensive addition of props and other 'life adding' features in the editor.  -In all my years of playing, only one other map has shined so brightly in my mind, Kunduz Afghanistan. (Mod) This one is better in nearly every regard to all that have come before it, especially in the way of textures and sound. Just flying around it is a real treat. Way to go, Bohemia!  Cons: -MP mission feels somewhat limited as to loadouts, especially by the end. -Its still ARMA, so high learning curve for being able to do all the things you need to know how to do. (Once mastered, the rewards are amazing.)  -As a fanthing, I have a hard time finding cons. Ive made solid friends from this game over the years playing in online communities, playing tactical cant be done any better. This game is a true to life military simulator. In fact, it is used under a different name for training the military. Being deployed to Afghanistan, I literally sat through a theater specific IED threat briefing that was entirely an ARMA video. I was jealous of the units they had to use. ;)  Asus MB, air cooled system i7 3770k 3.5GHz  16Gb Corsair Dominator 2x GTX 970 SLi, 850W psu 500Gb Samsung SSD + others some usless leds and the like",

When it first saw the Sun light it was buggy and badly optimized. I know. I was there at the begining (not with this acc.). After a time it started changing in a good way. Many new things have come: updates, fps improvment, bipods!, mods. Mods changed my way of thinking about Arma III. I used to be pessimistic and I didn't play a lot with it. But as these things came I started beleiving Arma III is good, it's getting better. I started using many mods, tons of maps and so on. Arma III is a great game so as Arma II. The main issue with this game is the people who can't see that this is not a COD or a BF. There are people out there crying about the realism of the game. I think this is the main reason why many people play it: the realism. It's great playing for hours in a milsim or in a CTI game. I can only recommend this game for people who loves these kind of games. It's not that expensive as it used to be, but I highly recommend firstly download this game from a website, try out if it's working and after that buying it. +thing: the camera mode. It's a great fun for people who are take shots with there camera in real life.",

The main campaign can be frustrating at times, but overall is a very excellent experience. User-made content and scenerios add another layer of depth, and Zeus gives an easy integration of that and multiplayer.    Multiplayer is by far the strongest point of the game, giving an in-depth experience in many a situation. You can play it as a roleplayer, joining Life servers. You can be a survivor of the wastes in Wasteland, or you can join in many user-made situations. The greatest of the options, however, is proper, team-based objective gameplay. With the right men, squads can work together to accomplish tasks against insurmountable odds. It gives a very strong sense of satisfaction to be part of such a team, and finishing the mission only solidifies that feeling.  If you want a very-well made military simulator, offering wonderful graphics, processor-melting situations, teamwork, tension and combined-warfare operation, Arma 3 is for you.",

The mods really do make these games come alive, but if it wasnt for the awesome Dev team and massive amount of content available with the vanilla game, the community as we know it wouldnt exist. I have never shared so many different emotions playing one game, Anger, fear, frustration, joy and curiousity as I let my imagination write a tale every time I log in. Of course your gaming experience will vary depending what type of mod you are playing, but thats just another great asset this game has, you can literally go from a battlefield 4 style game mode with 100+ players on a simply massive map, to a zombie survival in a wasteland, or strugling to survive as a prisoner recently dropped into a unkown island.  If you are looking for THE military simulator, that simply has it all and then some.. this is it.  The learning curve is steep, and there isnt much forgiveness from veteran players, but how you handle being thrown into the fire is up to you. Did I mention the modding community? because its insane, literally everything you wanted to create or play your own custom server is here, from base building, crafting, farming, flying, weapons, vehicles, maps, npcs etc etc etc the list is endless.  Currently I have been playing Exile servers with my Wife, there is persistent base building, missions, trading, looting, raiding, crafting and much more. Eventually you find the community that fits your play style and thats when you really get addicted. PVE/PVP, Roaming AI, Vehicles etc there are thousands of persistent servers running hundreds of variations of each mod, and almost all have very active players and admins.    No Doubt 10/10",

            "review_text": "My favorite game of all time is also a flawed mess. Let me explain.  Similar Games: Insurgency, Operation Flashpoint, Battlefield (in some respects)  Pros -Unforgiving hardcore tactical gameplay. -Realistic damage model. -Intense, Cinematic firefights that will have you at the edge of your seat and get your adrenaline pumping. -Co-op and PvP is amazing in this game if you play with the right people. -Has one of the most dedicated modding communities I have ever seen. -Easy to mod. -Many official and fan made gamemodes that are a blast to play. (Favorites: King of the Hill, CTI, Liberation, Insurgency) -Detailed open world enviroments. -Destructible buildings. -Overall a fairly welcoming community. -Dynamic gameplay, hardly anything is scripted. -Combined Arms gameplay. -Variety of roles to fill within a squad. (Ex: Medic, Sniper, Grenadier, etc.) Vehicular combat is also a thing. (Tanks, planes and helos are all included.) -Large scale battles among varied enviroments. (some modes simulate an enemy army moving along the map.) -Easily the best co-op game of all time. -The game is in constant development, with updates on nearly a monthly basis fixing issues and adding improved mechanics. The dev team seems to listen to requests of the community as well.  Cons -VERY steep learning curve. (You will get destroyed a lot when you begin.) -Bugs. Many Bugs, mainly collision issues which can be problematic, especially during PvP modes. Getting stuck on objects is common in this game. -Performance varries and is hardly based on your PC specs. (Most of the performance issues in the game are due to slow server speed and the amount of AI/Players that are accounted for at any given time during a game. The faster the server is the higher the FPS.) -Single player can be really dry. You will get hardly anything out of the game if you only play single player. -Clunky UI that takes some getting used to. This has been improving. -AI varries in intelligence and reaction time. This has been improved in the recent updates, but it is still pretty bad. -Only for a certain audience. -Some of the animations look rediculous.   Overall  I have had a fantastic time with this game. It is a clunky mess, but at the same time there is no game on the market that provides the same amount of freedom as well as tense, heart pounding gunfights that Arma does. However, the barrier to entry is so high, I think the only way to enjoy this game is to know someone or even better, a group of people, who play it regularly to show you the ropes. If you try to get into this game in any other way, you will have an absolutely miserable time. As I may have said earlier, a huge aspect of this game is the Co-op and if you play with people you don't like your opinions on the game will follow suit. Another thing to consider, is how niche the game is. Research and/or try before you buy.  10 out of 10 -As contradictory as this verdict might be considering all the problems this game has I cannot deny the amount of enjoyment I have gotten out of this game so far and the several hundred hours more to come out of it in the near future.  This game is for: Players seeking a tense, challenging, stress indusing, tactical shooter to play in cooperation with other like minded people.",

I have even learned to autorotate so the whole team dosn't die if the engine is damaged.  I have not used any type of special cotroller yet. I have a very old joystick which I tried using one time, but it is very unresponsive which is surely due to it being probably 15 years old. Normally I just use the keyboard to fly around and do very well. Remapping the keys to fly is a must. There are some crazy default keybinding layout for helicopters.  Flares work well. A lot of times you will be fired at in the air by enemies and flares will help guide rockets astray. You must still try to dodge them however, because not all rockets 'seek' you. Some are still just simple rockets and will still hit you. Mostly, for my experience online, you do not have too many rockets fired at you while on the ground, usually just while flying. So flying low across the ground to a landing spot is recommended, behind trees especially. Following roads up to a landing spot is good because you will avoid unloaded physical objects that can wreck you, but just make sure you don't fly right through a town or the AO doing this.",

Unlike other games that try to give a 'Warfare' experience but instead give you a stupid CQC stage, in this game, it is 'Do or Die', you must team up, but you can give it a try to being solo, of course, it will NOT be like Call of Duty or Medal of Honor, it will be... an unique close-to-real warfare experience.  The game has few guns, but they are unique and can make a difference. The variants are extended, making it a huge library of choices you can have. The bullets have an unique rendering, and you can have tracers (Red, Green.), which can be seen and can help to tell a nearby teammate where the enemy is. The vehicles are decent, most are sluggish and it does not really give you a civillian feeling, but it gives out most of the Military feeling.  Many servers to play in, with different modes: Altis Life, Co-op, Zeus and so on. You can find a game mode you want, and with the huge quantity of modifications existing around Steam and the internet, you will certainly never stop playing, unless tactics or marksmanship isn't your thing.   9.5/10",

I join a nice server which seemed to have nice people and they seemed to beonly rude to the cops. I am invited into a little group by this one guy to have some fun with.. 20 minutes later im in the back of a truck with a guy holding a gun to my face and im ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ my pants here.... So they take me into a hideout where they make me sing for them and then they kill me. As i wait for a medic im being t-bagged by like 10 people which is not cool. Once the medic came they killed him too and started t-bagging him. I then respawned a new man with a horrible past :(  Great game overall :D 10/10",

As a result, I have learnt several new skills from the game to use in my non virtual life. The first of which would be to undoubtedly be wary of stairs, every since I played this game I have never died in RL while going up stairs.  Another skill I have gained while playing life mods is learning how to make and sell drugs. I would be rich by now if I lived in Altis, but im saving for a plane ticket so it won't be long. There isn't enough time to explain every single skill I have learnt from this game but I think even just that one example of surviving stairs is enough to justify buying the game.

ArmA 3 really dominates the 'realistic, military, video game/simulator' genre. Combine some wicked creativity with ArmA 3's mission editor mode and you can create your own missions and scenarios. In the past people have used this to make their own additions to the game, such as new weapons, vehicles, clothing, and even entire maps! ArmA 3's customization is endless and will keep you constantly changing guns, attachments for them, and other equipment to match the situation your in. If you feel like playing solo, ArmA 3 has totally revamped its Campaign mode to keep the player's attention and actually immerse you in the ArmA universe, or forget the single-player all together and go play good cop-bad cop on Altis Life, a user created gamemode, or blowing up tanks and getting in random firefights with other players in Wasteland, also a user-created gamemode. If none of this satisfies you, then you can always just build your own mission, so that you and your own private team can go and enjoy a experience that I guarntee you is as close as you'll get to war before enlisting!",

I can easily say the best times I've had playing a video game have been in this game. Those times don't come easy though, and most videos don't do those times justice. Arma 3 is full of quailty people, but as it's seen significant growth, also growing amounts of trolls and not-so-friendly players. If you can find a group of players with a similar mindset and enough talent, you will have a fantastically unique time in this game.  Unlike most mainstream shooters, this game is almost entirely community based. Sure, Arma 3 itself is controlled and developed by Bohemia, but once you get in-game you are most likely playing a creation of another player. This completely opened ended sandbox of opportunities also has it's downsides though.  For one, performance isn't top notch. The game doesn't perform horribly in most cases, but a poorly scripted mission may lead to a drastic FPS decrease. Networked play will opperate fine under vanilla or well-created missions on a beefy server, but adding in a lot of players and custom scripts will quickly lead to major, annoying dsync.   The creative freedom in this game also means that expecting to launch the game, join any open server, and bunker down for some fun isn't a realistic expectation. A vast majority of the servers are community operated, meaning there are some very good and very poor servers. Apart from the diversity in game modes (a positive element), many of the same game modes (or missions) are modified by their respective server owners. This could mean some extra goodies, or some unexpectedly low FPS.  For all the negatives this game has, the positive elements will easily and repeated lead me to highly recommend this game.

And the pace is very different from your CoDs and Battlefields and whatnot.  But this isn't trying to be those games. It is not a shooter, it's a simulation. And it's the best one there is.  - It's a true sandbox game. From the campaign to the multiplayer. And there's nothing like it out there.   - The standard map, Altis, is a replica of the real-world island of Lemnos. And me and my mates love it so much, we're saving up to go there on holiday.  - You can do whatever you please. The scouting missions in singleplayer let you explore the map and do missions, the multiplayer opens up the entire map and lets you do whatever.  - Bohemia are absolute darlings and are doing a fantastic job. Have been for years. The community is beautiful, from the players to the modders.   Oh, and one of the devs got arrested for 'espionage' while visiting the island for research. That's how committed these people are.   TL;DR:  Joined a squad as a medic. Saved about 12 people, then got shot... a squadmate carried me on his back a full kilometre to get revived by another medic.  11/10, would get shot again.",

However, it's hard to get bored of everything that multiplayer has to offer; Altis Life RPG, Wasteland, Exile, Invade &amp; Annex, you name it.   The gameplay mechanics are the worst part of the game. You really can die by opening a bloody door, albeit rare. Not to mention the driving physics. It can be very tough to drive using just W, A, S and D. Even crashing into a rock that appears as though it just 'Came outta nowhere!' at 5MPH can do severe damage to your car and health. The game's packed with glitches.   Aside from the occasional buggy annoyance, if you're looking for a war simulator that allows a range of unique experiences, ARMA 3 is probably your best bet.",

This game is not the most optimized game out there, your PC might struggle like hell. You can enjoy this game if your PC specs meet the requirement, even so you might face FPS drop during gameplay (explosion, etc.). This game is CPU intensive, if you experience FPS drop, there's a chance it is caused by your CPU (unless you set the graphics all the way to high then your GPU might be the case too).  This is a military simulation game, if you like games like Call of Duty (and used to it), you might not like this game however if you want to try something new then this game is worth a shot. This game has limited HUD, there is no minimap and if somebody is shooting, you will not be given a hint and you will need to find the source yourself. You will be given a compass to help you to locate yourself, and to give other people hints about the location of the enemy. Every single bullet counts, I mean 1-3 shots can kill somebody, do not spray and pray. You will not be given a hint about your location, so you need to be observant and check your surrounding.  One big problem about this game is.... There is no melee so you can't kill other players with a knife, it can be a huge turn off for some people (I am one of those people), nevertheless it is less likely that you will use melee in the game, it is most likely a gunfight.  If you want a shooter game and want to spice things up then Arma 3 could be the game for you, if you are still unsure then you can check some YouTube videos and see it for yourself. This game is hard, the control buttons are many (I highly recommend newcomers to go to the tutorial first) before going into the campaign or multiplayer.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- My PC specs can be seen in my profile, just to let you know how well this game run at least in this setup.

Over the years, this clip has come to mean pure suffering to me and yet I cannot and WILL NOT stop watching. I have accepted the fact that I will never be Anne Hathaway’s forward young man, that is not the problem. How could I be? I’m nothing like this interviewer. I simply do not have this dumb ♥♥♥♥’s exquisite genes and playful personality, quite the contrary. If you need to know, I’m a fat, balding piece of human garbage living in a turd of a city and working at a dead-end customer service job for a greedy insurance company. My entire role there consists of telling people about the technicalities used to deny them coverage, so I know a thing or two about misery. I’m a broken man inside and out with few if any reasons to live, and yet my personal suffering is increased tenfold by knowing that I will never get even a whiff of Anne Hathaway’s soiled panties. I can tell you exactly what they look like, for I have pondered it. Anne is a simple woman, yet she is elegant also. Therefore, her panties reflect these qualities. She would never debase herself with the likes of a “g-sting” or a “thong-style” garnment. No, my friends, hers are of simple white cotton: clean, classic, tasteful, and with a small but noticeable urine spot in the crotchal area. Would that this video were in smellovision so I could finally realize my one and only dream of knowing her personal scent, suicide myself and truly die a happy man. Is that too much to ask? One freakin’ whiff of Annie’s juices? I mean, come on, Redbull should get on that ASAP. It’s great to see a triple backflip or whatever but I have an actual physical NEED for the smell of those panties. It boggles the mind that one of those visionary companies such as Google or SpaceX hasn't rolled out SOME version of the smellovision by now. In the 21st century, it is absolutely unacceptable that we don’t have access to this technology. It is criminal. How dare humanity presume to explore space, map the earth or cure deadly diseases when we can’t even conquer “the gap”? These ingenious fools need to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and hurry because the window of opportunity is closing. Don’t get me wrong, the Hathmonster is still fertile and fresh. As a matter of fact, I would argue that the organs are in their prime, but there is a lot of work to be done here. The technology for smellovision is not even near ready to provide the goods. It still needs to be developped, tested and rolled out on a massive scale. Even then, I doubt that the queen of smells would submit to a thorough and invasive panty-scan willingly (she’s too sophisticated for that), so we need to make advances in the field that would allow for telesopic smell capture or even x-ray smell replication. We’re two steps behind and it is simply frightening. The reality is that we might never get to dowload a perfectly compiled fragrance-code of her odorous ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and enjoy it in our homes. It’s a long shot, but maybe if everyone thumbed up this comment we could finally raise awareness on this issue. Maybe Richard Branson would see it and realise how urgent the situation is. Millions of people are dumping buckets on their head for some made up disease and meanwhile I can’t even get a retweet for my #SpreadTheSmell campaign? How is that fair? I can’t even get ONE lousy sniff? Why would God even put me on this ♥♥♥♥ing earth?﻿",

Arma 3: Brings allot to the table when fighting in wars I mean when I first played Arma 3 and that was when it was free on steam I instantly played the campaign and it was amazing, Not as great as Battlefield and Call Of Duty campaigns. Now lets cut this boring crap and talk about running the game.  Intel HD 4000+ Graphics Card: Will run the game, But on Low settings and will get over 30 FPS witch is all you need really to get a good feel of the game exept obviously crap graphics. It can run Arma 3 on a mixed scaled of Low and Medium settings but will get around 20 FPS depending on what settings you have changed to Medium ( I allways have Vsync off, Not sure if that improved FPS but I do it anyway :p ). However once you are flying in the air in combat like Apache's or Armed Little Birds for example your FPS goes up obviously because it does not render as much stuff around you as when you are on the ground you loose FPS.  AMD Graphics Card: Not sure about this graphics card as my old I3 Intel HD Graphics 4000 Laptop can run arma 3 in the ways I spoke about above but lets bring Arma 2: OA back here for a second, On Arma2: OA I get about 40-60 FPS witch is great and in the air about 70-80 FPS and thats perfect but I came across someone who uses a PC with a AMD graphics card and even on low settings he gets like 15 FPS and maybe 25 FPS if he is lucky. So Arma 3 wise I am not too sure on what FPS you will get.  I do not recommend anything like FPS boosters or Contig ect, As they may contain a virus and can slow down your computer badly.  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░  ░░░░░░░░░░░░░▄███▄▄▄░░░░░░░  ░░░░░░░░░▄▄▄██▀▀▀▀███▄░░░░░  ░░░░░░░▄▀▀░░░░░░░░░░░▀█░░░░  ░░░░▄▄▀░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░▀█░░░  ░░░█░░░░░▀▄░░▄▀░░░░░░░░█░░░  ░░░▐██▄░░▀▄▀▀▄▀░░▄██▀░▐▌░░░  ░░░█▀█░▀░░░▀▀░░░▀░█▀░░▐▌░░░  ░░░█░░▀▐░░░░░░░░▌▀░░░░░█░░░  ░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░  ░░░░█░░▀▄░░░░▄▀░░░░░░░░█░░░  ░░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░▄▄░░░░█░░░░  ░░░░░█▀██▀▀▀▀██▀░░░░░░█░░░░  ░░░░░█░░▀████▀░░░░░░░█░░░░░  ░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░▄█░░░░░░  ░░░░░░░██░░░░░█▄▄▀▀░█░░░░░░  ░░░░░░░░▀▀█▀▀▀▀░░░░░░█░░░░░  ░░░░░░░░░█░░░░░░░░░░░░█░░░░",

            "review_text": "ARMA 3 is a solid military simulator that really gets its legs from the modding community. Many ppl are familar with the ARMA series for one reason alone and that is the DayZ mod, it's even a well known fact that the game ARMA 2 sold more copies shortly after DayZ was released than it had since it's initial release. Not having played much single player besides a few short training sessions this review is going to be mostly focused on the multiplayer mods, gameplay and engine in general.  First of all I want to say that this game may not be for those with underpowered PCs ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE PLAYING MULTIPLAYER. While the engine performance is dramaticly improved over ARMA 2 unfortunently it seems that in multiplayer performance will suffer especially with high player counts due to a combination of server performance (running an ARMA server is very resource heavy especially cpu) and netcode shortcommings. The graphics have been improved over its predecessor as well as performance allowing for even greater view distances than I was able to pull off in ARMA 2 while still having playable framerates. Lighting in my opinion seems to have been improved the most leading to many atmospheric moments when I would find myself taking a screenshot. Models have all been improved quite a bit with the character models receiving the greatest leap in graphic fidelity, I can almost feel the stubble on the manly mans face sitting next to me in the attack chopper its the future I tell you.  As you would expect in a military simulator there is a huge variety of boom sticks and vehicles to play with and not having a knowledge of military equipment or really a lot of experience with ARMA 2 I won't go into what guns/vehicles are new or what is more or less realistic. The gun and vehicle models however have seen a fantastic improvement in overall texture detail and resolution and the animations in general are a giant improvement over previous ARMA games with many of them appearing to be motion capped for that sexy smoothness.  Gameplay has shown improvement in equal lengths with my favorite additions being the character stance positions, revamped inventory system, and much more natural feeling to movement in general. This is partly due to the fact that animations in general have been improved but also because mouse acceleration and smoothing seem to have been fixed. Combat feels solid and realistic the effects and sounds of warfare do well to set the mood and convince you that you are really blowing the ♥♥♥♥ out of someone or really in the ♥♥♥♥.   The positional audio is fantastic and you can tell the approximate distance of gunshots based on their volume, and trust me the sound of a gunshot travels a long long ways. I also want to mention your characters sound effects, visual effects, and ambient animations, I love these and they really pull me into the experience. I have been walking for nearly 30min and I have finally made it to the cocaine fields but someone saw me comming. Oblivious I stand collecting the leaves when I hear something and my heart sinks, the rustling of feet and whispers in the bushes. I panic and turn the way I came bursting into a full sprint as I hear sirens begin to blare out and helicopter blades begin to spin. I'm sprinting at full speed now and the edges of my vision blur as I run blindly into the darkness. I'm breathing more heavily now and my vision is more tunneled than before, the color seems to have melted away slightly and I can't focus my eyes. Still running I'm breathing so heavy now that I gasp for air at times nearly choking on the air i'm attempting to breathe. The sirens are now far off in the distance and the whirling blades of the helicopter have nearly left ear shot, I gasp for more air as I slowly regain a normal rate of breathing. I wipe my brow to remove the sweat and my vision finally clears, I can see the boat I rode in on still there waiting for me I feel much better now. It's these little details that make an experience like that feel personal and real, this was an experience I had playing the mod 'Altis Life'. Everything in the right situation really comes together to bring you into the game experience and this is somthing ARMA 3 has pulled off well.   Now the mods are where I think ARMA really shines as they provide infinite replayability assuming the community continues to develop for the platform. So far I have to say I am very impressed with the creativity of the mods and the scope of the mods in general. Want to recreate a historical engagement, maybe survive the zombie apocalypse, or perhaps selling fish and smoking weed is more your gig? You can do it all with the vast array of mods already available, but I want to talk quickly about my new favorite mod Altis Life. Altis life is a roleplaying mod were you must choose whether you are a civillian or a cop and you must live out you life however you choose. Civs must make a living whether legal or illegal it's you choice and your options are vast for how you do so. The cops must keep the civs in line and enforce the laws, if you are running around smoking weed and yelling F*ck the police you are probably gonna get pulled over, beaten, and arrested. Play it cool and do the speed limit maybe you will get away with that trunk full of heroin and get rich quick. Or maybe you just want to pick peaches, smoke your weed, and claim its for medical purposes when the cops pull you over its your choice and it is really great fun.  There is so much more to say about this game and the potential it has with the fantastic modding community but I've written too much here already and i'm tired so i'm going to bed. On second thought maybe ill just do one more run to the poppy fields.",

I have been playing a bit of the standard Arma 3 features which are fun, but the sheer number of mods and workshop missions is unreal! This game is so flexible.  My most favourite mods and missions I have been playing are:  Altis life: think along the lines of GTA, but everyone ever where is a real player, the police, military, bandits, civilians, criminals, everyone. It is a very immersive mission where you do what you want, whenever you want. Earn money through doing legal jobs, or become a criminal and traffic drugs, rob banks, rob other players, do whatever you want to survive, but beware your actions could get you on the police wanted list. Buy food, weapons, vehicles, licenses and so much more, it is a great experience when your on an active server.  Escape Altis: an online coop game which can also be played single player, your goal to escape the huge island of altis. You will encounter AI enemy`s in all kinds of locations, choose how you get through, stealthy? Or guns blazing? Do it your way! This mission is very challenging and lots of fun, best with mates!  Breaking Point: Think Dayz but on a bigger map, less glitches and now a choice of 5 factions to choose from. Each with their own perks, rules (or none depending which you choose), and appearance. Breaking point provides 5 maps, Altis, Stratis, Thirsk summer and Thirsk winter.  The thirsk maps are PvP orientated with survival thrown in for good measure.  Stratis is bigger than than Thirsk maps with a bigger focus on survival against zombies and other players. Altis is just huge!  While breaking point is still in its infancy, the dev team is working really hard at it and adding new features and maps frequently. Vehicles in this mod are fairly rare, so expect work to be done finding them, you will also have to fix them up to get them working to.  I love the Arma 3 engine, it is so flexible and allows for so many different ways to play, it just never gets dull.  I highly recommend it!",

I recommend getting the DLC Pack with it and (as soon as it releases) getting the expansion. The DLCs bring cool new content to the game and it is a great way to additionally support the Developers  ArmA can also be greaty improved with mods, to anyone new to the game: Check out mods like TFAR, ACE3, ASR AI and RHS:Escalation",

Yes, there's a campaign, yes you can do the mil-sim related tasks and wage war against other mil-sim players, but this game isn't typically played like that. Custom maps like: Altis Life, King of the Hill, Battle Royale Mod, etc are how most people end up playing and enjoying this game.  As of this writing I play this game, for the most part, once or twice a week, but as you can see I've logged hundreds of hours on this game. That should speak quite a bit in regards to the fun factor. Whether you want to Role-Play with other players (who 50/50 just shoot anyways), play a giant game of king of the hill with big guns and vehicles, or just play an hour long survival last man standing kind of game... Arma III offers it.  Downsides to this game, bugs, lots of them, expensive DLC, and one of the most poorly optimized games I've ever played. The game would greatly benefit from a way more optimized engine that doesn't tank a modern PC under 60FPS by just being in a town.   Once again, that said, you can spend hundreds of hours entertaining yourself in the world that is Arma and I do highly reccomend this game for all shooter fans.",

Where landing craft was landing on the Beaches and men were getting killed... I landed in the airport and I remember how people were signing up for the army. I ran through the grass in California, rushing to the airport to head to Afghanstan. After I landed, we landed in Europe somwhere. It get us half an hour to get though training. I fell asleep after a day. I woke up hearing the transports going by of Officers. I got up and looked around, I decided to go aboard my Heilcopter. I looked outside, the driver closed the Heilcopter down after my new sqaud got in. I looked as we passed the terrain, beatiful. Then we were going accross the sea. I still had my pistol out and tried to quickly figure out where my gun was. Then, I saw land, the same land and beach I saw on T.V. We landed a mile or two away from the beach. I didnt have time to figure out my equitment so I rushed with my sqaud. My sqaud was getting ahead of me. Heilcopters and airplanes were everywhere above me. I kept running, my sqaud split up, I kept falling my objective to follow my leader. I looked ahead and saw fences and tons of troops. I finally got my gun out and rushed accross grass and fences.  All of a suddden, gunshots started to fire, I didnt know where so I kept running. A sharp pain in my hand and I dropped to the floor taking cover. I kept crawling until my worst enemy was in front of me: The fence. I decided to get up and run, I kept running until I reached the troops running in the dirt. Then, my sqaudron started to move out to the town. On my way I saw men surrounding a man. The man was dead, I heard gunshots all over again. The man checked the boddy and the dead man got up. The sniper was shot by his own teamate. I rushed to where the sqaudron was and they healed the man, appolgizeing. I kept rushing through, all of a sudden, 'Mission accpomplished men, onto the next objective'! I lost my team everybody spreaded out. A Heilcopter was picking a man up, I rushed to it and it took off without me. I decided to head back to where I ran through the fences. I kept running, I noticed that I was thirsty, I was tired. I kept running, trying to figure out my radio. Pressing buttons all over. All of a sudden, I pressed one button and talked into it: 'Hello, Hello this is Robert, this is my first time fighting and I need a medic!' I repeated the same sentence this time louder. No reply came to me and I was worried I would die  Sweat came accross my face as I looked into a empety Heilcopter. I got in and he took me further into the fighting, not back to H.Q. I never knew when the battle was gonna be over. I frogot my Journal on the other Heilcopter and noticed this Heilocopter from H.Q. The ride was longer, we passed many farms in ruins and a city. The heilcopter stopped and dropped me off, alone. Another Heilcopter came in and quickly a man jumped out of it. I remember a attack Heilcopter above me. I ran to the village and was shot multiple times. I turned quickly and got on the ground, I was shot in the back.  I fell asleep. I woke up back at H.Q. wondering what was happening. 'go go go!' A man shouted as cars passed by. I was eager to get back into the Chopper. I got in and there was a bigger, new sqaud in the Heilcopter. They wispered plans to eachother. I started to write my first battle but time went by and everybody got out. 'Robert, go go go!' The man shouted, I got out and the heilcopter waited a second then lifted off the ground. This time we landed in the same spot I stayed with my team this time but the same comamnder came on the radio. 'Great job you have taken the objective'. Our team ran to the forest silently. Our sqaud commander took his binoculars and looked ahead. 'Retreat!' Kept repeating on our radios. A half an hour later, armour was spotted and I ♥♥♥♥♥♥ myself. We were under fire and multiple jets were spotted. A artillery shot fired and the civillian that came with us fell to the ground. The Marine got his SAW and fired it.  We moved into the town and we thought the two heilcoptesrs were enemy heilcopters. We got into one of the Heilcopters and we waited for a long time for many people to get in. Ranger sqaud got in with snipers and a civillian got in. WE lifted off the ground and this time it felt alot more scarier. All of a sudden while I was about to say somthing a huge hole went into the glass and hit the machine gun and almost killed the sniper. Bullets were everywhere and there were jets outside picking us off. I wanted to get out but everything was down. Nobody moved and we were going on. The heilcopter exploded and we all flew out. A pack of us layed there. I was gonna call for a medic but I couldnt reach it. Nobody could find us. We were all lost. All I could do was finish my story and await for sombody to find me.      Thanks for reading this was my first time and im eager to do my 2nd adventure and then get some mods like the zombie mod and Colonial mod!!!",

You can zero your scopes to get perfect shots from a distance. 1st and 3rd person views allow for very tactical gameplay.

If only there were more developers like these, along with Valve, and other notable examples.  Improved physics, graphics, mechanics, fantastic soundtrack, modding support, mission editor, this is the military sim to rule all military sims, and it feels a damn sight more snappy than its predecessor too, which really tickled me gleefully. Of course, it still has a few optimization issues, but it is certainly an improvement over previous titles.  Even if you don't like what the vanilla game has to offer, there are many dedicated modders out there creating new and free content for you to enjoy, and so are the developers!

(wasn't expecting a run and gun, but i was expecting to play a war game, not a run around grinding gold with stupid rules and having to have a job rpg) i would say avoid it.. i tried so hard to get a refund, but steam sucks, and i couldn't even get a real response from a human being.. now im stuck with this useless single player game.. i keep trying to force myself to find something fun to do with it, and it can't be done... on the other hand technically and graphically it;s amazing and the attention to details is great... it was just squandered on a community with terrible terrible terrible ideas on how it should be played... the addition of official servers wih official game modes, would make this game a 10 out of 10... until then, its like a 2.. unless you like pretending to be an under paid truck driver that gets harrasse by lame people who think they are digital police..  i personally wish i never spent a dime on this game...",

I normally don't like these types of games because they seem to create their own version of reality that makes the game even less realistic. For instance: Enemy troops, who have just been established as being too dumb to find their ♥♥♥ on a map of their own homeland are now able to hit you, without scopes, in heavy cover at 300 meters. In contrast, a veteran marine gets tired from walking up a gentle slope for two minutes. However, the single player is meant to train you for multiplayer, and it succeeds in doing this. Or you would think.  The multiplayer allows for plenty of roles, so if you are new, you can always stick to support. Unfortunately, the FPS is going to be around 25 on standard gfx. I also get this feeling that 80% of the people have NO CLUE what is going on. This is usually a sign of scattered game design.  Optimization is kinda bad depite being almost indistinguishable from a game from 2006 with a ton of AA modded in, but how else are you going to move those newly rebranded Nvidia cards off the shelves every year?  The keyboard bindings are a tragic mess. Double right clicking to use the iron sites? Five different buttons to use all the menus and submenus? Various key combinations to draw a LINE ON A MAP?? Using a layout standard that does not resemble anything ANY OTHER WELL KNOWN GAME uses? It does not help that there seems to be a .75 second delay to all commands.  This is the Crusader Kings II of FPSs, except where Crusader Kings is ♥♥♥♥ed because of random events that cause your King/Duke/Whatever to grow a nipple out of his forehead, totally trashed mechanics that allow for an army of 14 archers to defeat your army of 1240 because it was raining and they felt kind of down and AI that seems to really hate you especially for no clear reason other than that they want to capture you and cut out your eyes and testicles, ARMA III has controls that make no sense and optimization that makes Company of Heroes 2 look like it could run on a TI-83 calculator.   Buy for the (extremely short) single player on sale. The idea is novel, but not so much the implementation.  I feel sorry for those poor designers who got arrested by the Greek Armed forces during this game's production. Not worth it.",

Arma 3 is also that rare – these days – game that will push all but the most powerful PC hardware. It looks amazing even on older systems, but if you want to crank it up at eye-bleeding resolutions you’re going to see performance loss.  ",

What you do in this game is shoot and survive, as well and try to eventually get to the end of the campaign, which is the same thing you do in Minecraft. There is even crafting if you get mods! This game wants to be like Minecraft!  Five Nights at Freddy's comes in at night time. You walk around trying to avoid other harmful cisgenders, or sit in your base (like in FNaF) and try not to die. This is a carbon copy of FNaF at night time, yet it costs twice if not thrice as much.  Then there's Garry's Mod RP when you play a mode called Altis Life. IT'S THE SAME THING! THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS THE GRAPHICS, AND IT'S WORSE THAN DARKRP! You have to grind for hours just to get a gun license, and when you get the gun you are shot down by police for being black and have to start all over again.  And finally, it also copies pokemon go. In a mode called Wasteland, you walk around on your map trying to collect different vehicles to harm other cis-gender scum, but there are WasteStops, or as they call it in game, 'shops', for you to get the appropriate gear as to set out to find the vehicles. or you can just purchase them, which I think is a Pay2Win aspect and that's why Pokemon Go is better.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

Its because Arma 3 provides the user with the tools to create whatever he wants.  You finished the campaign ? No problem , here are hundreds of user created missions for you that you can now play. You dont like the missions ? No problem , here is the editor in which you can make ur own missions. You dont like the Arma 3 Factions/Weapons/Vehicles /Visual FX/Sound/AI/Realism ? No problem , here , download the hundreds of mods available for free. You want to create ur own content ? Here are the modding tools , you can do / create whatever you want with them.

Everything from the sounds to the character models you can tell have been worked on in great detail. If you haven't played Arma before there are some great tutorials to help you get started. This game also gets even better with friends as you can be tactical and outmanuver your enemies. I really can't say enough about this game it is just great. I would say the most annoying thing about it though is that your singleplayer saves get wiped as soon as the game is updated which is why I haven't finished it yet but besides that you should really get this game, you won't regret it!",

There are no longer DayZ mods due to obvious reasons, but Epoch and Overpoch are pretty much the same as it. Like the Hunger Games series? try Battle Royale. Like massive open-world money-based (ingame of course) team deathmatches? A3Wasteland is your mod. And then there are the singleplayer mods. Iron Front, the WW2 squad based one (which I believe is multiplayer too), Dynamic Universal War Simulator, a massive war of which you are pretty much a field generalblowing up those damn OPFOR kiddos. These are only a few examples of what are to come if you just buy this game.  And could I forget the voice commands? GlovePIE or VAC, whatever your thing is you can just shout into your mic THREE, SUPPRESSING FIRE or TEAM RED, GET IN THAT TANK and they will and you will feel good about yourself.

So expect to bring friends to this if you would like to play missions online. - The game's performance is heavily decided by the server. If the server laggs you will not only get lagg, but a low framerate as well.

I introduced myself to him, He Introduced his name as well. His name was John, as we were waiting for more teammates to join us on the ride to the objective, We chatted about this war (Trying to RP Here and he joins me in RPing) As we were chatting he told me that he been playing this game for 769 hours now, and that he was going to quit soon. I told him i understood why, The helicopter was full now and we began to lift off and go to the objective. As we were going there we were shot at and began to crash everyone jumped off and was killed, Me and John were still inside the helicopter that was falling slowly He told me 'Jump, go now you ♥♥♥♥er.' I jumped and made it into the ocean with a broken leg, I swam up as fast as i can, and saw the helicopter slowly fall and crash into the mountain side, and then exploded. I swam to shore quickly and patched my leg up and ran to crash. I found his dead body and said in chat 'RIP IN PIECES John.' i took his gun which was better then mine and ran to the battlefield. As i made it to the battle field, there were explosions, gunshots, Helicopters crashing and then exploding, and People dying right in front of me. I have indeed seen some ♥♥♥♥, I saw a fellow soldier on the ground i asked if he was ok he replied' Does it look like im ♥♥♥♥ing OK?'  'I'm crawling for ♥♥♥♥s sake when i could be running at the hill and be taking it over.' I said 'Ok, ok here' I dropped a med kit and ran to the Hill we were suppose to take over.  I saw 3 enemies run pass me, i shot at them and killed 2. One of the enemies saw me and began to fire at me and shot at me chest once. I ran and the enemy followed. As i thought i was going to be found and then shot, I attempted to heal up but then he found me and was about to fire when 2 teammates came to me and killed the enemy.  I thanked them, healed up and ran to the belly of the beast. I met a teammate being shot at heavily and was wounded I told him to run to me, he told me he couldn't he was hurt and couldn't run. I threw a gernade at the area where all the enemies were shooting at and got a double kill but 2 enemies survived. He had time to run towards me and survive but as he tried to run towards me a Sniper got him in the leg and made him crawl, as he was about to die he told me to run, the sniper finished him off and hen payed attention to me. The sniper shot me injuring me and i began to crawl. 4 Enemies ran toward sme and all four shot at me. And i respawned. 10 out of 10, will get shot at by 4 people and wounded by a sniper again.",

Put the fish in the frying pan and pour over 500ml of the milk. Stud each onion quarter with a clove, then add to the milk, with the bay leaves. Bring the milk just to the boil – you will see a few small bubbles. Reduce the heat and simmer for 8 mins. Lift the fish onto a plate and strain the milk into a jug to cool. Flake the fish into large pieces in the baking dish. Hard-boil the eggs. Bring a small pan of water to a gentle boil, then carefully lower the eggs in with a slotted spoon. Bring the water back to a gentle boil, with just a couple of bubbles rising to the surface. Set the timer for 8 mins, cook, then drain and cool in a bowl of cold water. Peel, slice into quarters and arrange on top of the fish, then scatter over the chopped parsley. Make the sauce. Melt half the butter in a pan, stir in the flour and cook for 1 min over moderate heat. Take off the heat, pour in a little of the cold poaching milk, then stir until blended. Continue to add the milk gradually, mixing well until you have a smooth sauce. Return to the heat, bringto the boil and cook for 5 mins, stirring continually, until it coats the back of a spoon. Remove from the heat, season with salt, pepper and nutmeg, then pour over the fish. Assemble and bake. Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Boil the potatoes for 20 mins. Drain, season and mash with the remaining butter and milk. Use to top the pie, starting at the edge of the dish and working your way in – push the mash right to the edges to seal. Fluff the top with a fork, sprinkle with cheese, then bake for 30 mins. Make up to a day ahead, chill, then bake for 40 mins.",

Overall Arma 3 does look a lot better, but still runs pretty poorly regardless of high end hardware (i7 960@4.1Ghz+STRIX R9 390X/ 3930K@4.2Ghz+STRIX GTX 1060/ i7 4770K@4.3Ghz+780Ti MATRIX SLI (previously 290X MATRIX CF and 390X STRIX CF) / i7 6700@stock+GTX 1070FE / i7 5930K@4.5Ghz+STRIX 980Ti SLI (previously 780Ti MATRIX SLI).   Rather than wasting time on a dubious futuristic setting it would have been far better for the developers to focus on quashing performance issues and providing a believable simulation with realistic damage based on impact point+round+angle. Also AI is still very dumb and STILL unable to haul @$$ with a sense of urgency.   I see Arma 3 as a downhill slide for the series, being far more casual than previous iterations in terms of attempted realism compounded by unwillingness to expand the core mechanics for realism that had been laid down since OPFP. In a way it's more like the Battlefield version of the series.  Also on the campaigns; they are straight up trash. Resistance and Red Hammer have not been bested to date, although the Arma 2 campaign was pretty fun. Arma 3 is just a slog of monotony; APEX is a waste of money.",

Playing alone isn't to great but with friends you capture the whole experience of Arma 3. The maps are huge so you have to do lots of exploring,pretty cool if you enjoy exploring. The vehicles have their own controls maybe except the land vehicles and some other type of vehicles. The air vehicles are hard to control unless you played the rest of the Armas.(BTW still don't know how to use air vehicles). Is this a full release or a beta? I do not know it has plenty after plenty of bugs to fix. Like when that time I shot some one his body had an oversized neck the body itself had its body armor turned into a size of a pea.

            "review_text": "ARMA III is one of those games that is really cool in it's own unique way. Unfortunately, ARMA can't stay out of it's own way long enough to remain cool. Before I start, I should mention that this review is based only on my experiences of single player and the editors with the deal-breaking focus on the editors themselves. That said, I'm expecting the dislikes to rain.  This is a difficult one to review. As of writing I've played about 40 hours of almost exclusively single player/editor use. In some ways I really enjoy this game. The biggest draw for me was the editor(s) in this game. The ability to create my own skirmishes anywhere on this giant island and watch them unfold is awesome. You can basically make up any scenario you can imagine and play it out. This alone has kept me entertained for at least 30 hours by itself. I got past the extremely unintuitive user interface and AI quirks and genuinely had a good time hiking around and blowing stuff up.  But, if ARMA is anything, it's a shining example of why documentation is so important in software development. The documentation for ARMA's editors, both 2D and 3D, is bad. And when it's not bad, it's non-existent. What does the Game Logic object actually do in the editor when it seemingly has no inputs or outputs? Why do some modules need to be synced to each other when others don't? How are you supposed to figure out what to sync to what and when?   Usually, there is no answer. Or the answer is outdated or inconsistent between the different editors. Or you'll find other people asking the same questions with the responses basically shrugging. The answers I did find always came down to a 'copy paste this script' or 'follow these exact steps' with no further explanation as to why I was doing these things. That's great for getting something working instantly, not so great for learning how to use the systems and building the intuition needed to take things further.   I don't think this is about the complexity of the editor, I think this is about bad design decisions and lack of consistent, clear documentation. I've worked with Garry's Mod coding for at least a thousand hours and have developed software for many different languages from Python to assembly. The only reason I was able to accomplish these things was from the comprehensive documentation on how things worked and _why_ they worked. And even if they didn't have those things, they at least gave a brief snippit on what is required for the function/module to actually work. Something that the ARMA amazingly doesn't have for the vast majority of it's objects. Just looking at the MP editor modules on ARMA's own wiki page, only about 3% of the listed modules have documentation. The game TIS-100 is more approachable than the depths of these editors.   So, I've had fun with ARMA for the most part. But this well is running dry for me quickly. I wish it wasn't because this feels like the kind of game I would enjoy if ARMA didn't tie its own hands behind its back. For the reasons that I bought this game, I wouldn't recommend it. If you play it for multiplayer, your experience will probably be completely different. So, take this for what it's worth.",

It's BORRING.  Even when i actually got to shoot half a hour later... the gun physics are so lame i laughed and shortley after quit and uninstalled it. If you shoot a rifle at 50 metres square at a target the size of a torso, the bullet will hit it, but in this so called SIM it won't most of the time. Guns just are not that unaccrate. shotguns have spread not rifles. a rifle at 50 metres will be 1 cm each way tops not 50 cm. that alone is enough for me to quit and uninstall it and NEVER play it again.",

            "review_text": "This game looked promising in alpha but has been patched to a worse and worse state ever since. Don't let any of the pretty screenshots or clips fool you. It's practically still an alpha game and will probably never leave this state. If you're the type of person who finds fun in playing scenarios against extremely stupid bots, this might serve. For anyone else, don't waste your money. The netcode is absolutely horrible - the game is full of lagging, rubberbanding and anything else you might expect from a game that hasn't been finished at all. No matter how fast of a hellmachine you have below your desk, the game will almost always run at max. ~35fps in multiplayer, a lot less if in action. So aiming and hitting someone is rather a game of luck than anything else. Further, the gun and aiming mechanics are absolutely cumbersome and just annoy the crap out of you in combination with the weak engine. Right now you just aim at someone, fire, and very often absolutely nothing happens. No hit, no blood, nothing, even after firing a whole magazine at the enemy while keeping the crosshairs exactly at him, from a distance of, say, 50-100m. Does actually happen. In multiplayer the enemy you try to eliminate then starts running around like a rabbit (because they know exactly how it looks on your screen - it makes it even harder to hit him, because he starts teleporting from one point to another), and tries to spot you while doing so. Yes, that's right. In a 'military simulation' it has proven to be more effective to run around like a crazy ape, right in the open field, than to look for cover and continue from there. The structures look mostly the same and are full of bugs aswell. You can't go through a door without getting stuck in some way, in like 50% of cases you get stuck right at the bottom of stairs and have to take a step back and try again (no need to mention how much it's going to trigger you if you get killed because of this stupid sh..). So stairs and doors are to be considered extremely risky to use - just like in real life right? Right, it's a simulation, it has to be realistic!  In spite of everything the developer of this game absolutely avoids improving the engine or the netcode since release in any way, they rather design some new weapons they can wrap into a dlc and sell for 10 bucks. Since alpha the game has used cpu power in an absolutely unoptimized manner, has therefore extremely poor performance on even newer machines and just makes it impossible to have a nearly fluid aiming experience. There is always some lag or stutter that often will decide about the outcome of a confrontation.  Like I said in the beginning, there was a lot of hope and potential for this game when alpha released, but this is now more than 3 years ago and not many of the relevant aspects and weaknesses of this game were actually improved. It might actually have gotten worse since then. I bought it for like 20€ back then and even for this price I would definitely not buy it again. Do not buy this crippled piece of software.",

I am a man all day, doing manly things at my manly job, and when I come home I just want to be a boy.   I have no problem getting killed with a single bullet, dealing with bullet drop, limited amo, or stamina effects on aiming. I love all of those things, and those are the reasons I started this relationship. But you're high maintinance, I can't give you the time you require, and I don't have a big enough friend group for you to like me.  Yesterday:  4hrs - Play singleplayer to learn controls, loving the game so far.  0.5hrs - Jump into 'Quick Play' try to go into normal FPS game modes like catpure the flag. All but two game modes either told me it couldn't find a server, or that I didn't have the DLC. Seems odd to me.  0.5hrs - Playing 'Caputre the Island' spawned in the middle of the ocean. WTF!!? Some guy on mic says you need to install something which will make a carrier ship appear, so if you don't have that you just fall into the ocean and can't get to the helicopters. Hmm okay.  1hrs - Same game, spawning at the points that are on land. Me and about 15 people are all waiting on a heli to pick us up. Sigh... Bored... Oh look a heli, yay!  0.05hrs - Heli gets shot down in route to town, I bail the heli like a Jason Bourne bad @ss and go to deploy my parachute to fly in like a tiger ninja raining down bullet hell that could make a grown man cry... but I don't have a parachute. Splat!   0.5hrs - Profanity, inanimate objects accelerating accross the room at forces greater than or equal to gravity, anger at game, dissapointment in purchase, hope of reimbursement, worry about game time spent in single player, sadness at time lost, look at clock and it is past bed time, tired, work tomorrow.  I am a software engineer by day and spend a lot of time figuring out computer related things. Like a TV show watcher, I too like to unwind at the end of the day, but for me I get that in gaming.   No I'm not 60, I am in my 20's.  WORKING FOR FUN IS NOT FUN WHEN YOU JUST GOT DONE WORKING FOR 8 HOURS.  In conclusion, Arma I'm sure there is someone perfect out there for you...but it's not me. I really wanted us to work out, I truly did, but it wasn't meant to be. I hope we can still be friends....  ps. yes I tried other game modes as you can see from my play time, but I didn't have much success. One game I got in and 2 mins later got kicked, I wasn't using a mic, I was playing the objective so not sure what I did.  yes I know this is a strategic sim, not a fly out of a heli 007 game, I was really mad that I had to A) spawn and wait close to an hour for another heli, or B) quit, download software for the carrier and join back in  In that timespan I could have played 2 BF4 games and had loads of fun. I wish Battlefied was more tacticle, but I'll take it over Arma because I have more fun overall.",

Arma 3 contains a simple campaign with an uninteresting story that is simply there for solo players who want to go through structured missions. A lot of people slate call of duty and battlefield for having bad campaigns but my God the Arma 3 campaign is poor compared to any call of duty or bettlefield game I have played. The campaign is full of 2 Dimensional characters and it really takes some time to get going. I like the freedom the campaign gives but this brief freedom soon grows boring and stale.   Arma contains a variety of gamemodes on the multiplayer side, Most just feel unstructured and boring. It is a very long and soul crushing task finding a decent server or let alone any server playing certain gamemodes like deathmach and it is an even longer task trying to force yourself to enjoy the game. The Role playing (Altis life ETC) servers in particular are extremely boring and you are SERIOUSLY better off playing garrys mod roleplay servers if you enjoy those gamemodes.   I GUARENTEE you will get more enjoyment on a darkRP server....   Arma 3 just feels like a waste of time, I regret buying this game, I wouldnt of bought it if I wasnt pushed into buying it by my friends who dont even play this anymore.

            "review_text": "It's the dead of night on the CSAT-occupied island of Stratis, and the peaceful darkness is about to explode into chaos. I'm leading one of two spec-ops teams on a mission to liberate the leader of a local guerrilla faction and return him to the much larger island of Altis. A British squad is in charge of the actual rescue. Our job is to cause as much trouble across the island as possible to distract the CSAT forces and give the British the opening they need.  Over the next hour, that's precisely what I do. Inserting by boat from the northwest coast, I head south and raid an ammo dump before cutting across to the eastern shore to destroy a heliport. Then my squad suppresses an enemy encampment from a hillside near the centre of the island as I swoop in from the west to flank them. Yet before we can regroup, my entire team is killed by reinforcements descending from the north, and the British still need more time to complete their mission. Alone, I rush to the southernmost tip of the island, where I blow up a fortified anti-air position before escaping by riding a quad bike back through the swarming enemy forces to the extraction point, where the boat takes me home.  Arguably the biggest complaint about Bohemia Interactive's post-Flashpoint games is that their campaigns haven't used the magnificent landscapes they create to their full potential. The first Arma's campaign was a hastily cobbled-together disappointment, while it took a certain zombie-survival mod to harness the austere and foreboding power of Arma 2's Chernarus. That Arma 3 uses half an island for just one of its twenty-odd missions is indicative of Bohemia's effort to resolve this ongoing issue. Indeed, taken as a whole, Arma 3 strives to make this deep and impenetrable military simulator series a more comprehensive, more engaging and more user-friendly experience. It isn't completely successful, but I had an awful lot of fun watching it try.  While Arma 3 was officially released back in September, the campaign has been portioned out in three substantial chunks over the last six months. Each chapter is a self-contained entity with its own story arc and theme; combined, they tell the tale of the excitingly named Corporal Ben Kerry and his role in the war over the fictional Mediterranean island archipelago of Altis and Stratis, waged between four different factions.  The first part, Survive, is geared towards introducing players to Arma. It takes place entirely on the smaller of Arma 3's two islands, Stratis, and sees Kerry banding up with a group of NATO survivors after the local Altian Armed Forces, backed by NATO's eastern equivalent CSAT, rise up against the local US garrison. For the most part, missions are small-scale skirmishes that keep you firmly in the 'follower' category while teaching you the basics of minimising your daily lead intake. Rescuing a downed helicopter crew instructs you on establishing a defensive position, while a midnight liaison with local militia explains how to flank and clear buildings.  It's hardly the campaign's most spectacular stage. Story-wise, it's let down by voice acting that ranges from passable to cringeworthy and a script that understands military radio chatter but not how human beings interact with one another. Even here, though, Bohemia's approach to maximising the assets it has built is apparent. Missions are nearly always multi-staged, with objectives being added and changed as events rarely go according to plan.  While it smoulders rather than sparks, Survive concludes strongly and the momentum is carried over into Adapt, definitely the best of the three chapters. This introduces Altis, a masterwork of environmental design. I could write another 1000 words on its remarkable sights and sounds: its misty dawns, crimson dusks and streetlight-speckled nights. But what's most important is how the detail that's gone into mapping the landscape's undulations - the lumps and bumps, hills and valleys - plays into the game's combat. A little rise in the ground might be the difference between life and death as you throw yourself down in evasion of the fiendishly accurate enemy AI. When they stop to reload, you'll rush to locate a better vantage point, order your men to 'find cover' (an extremely handy new command) and plant half a dozen bullets in your opponent's surprisingly tough body.  Tactics are vital in Arma 3, but it's terrain that really makes the difference between success and failure. It's crucial to learn this before Adapt begins, because the difficulty suddenly ramps up. The first mission sees you alone, unarmed and with a city full of enemy soldiers between you and any kind of safety. At this point, setting saves to unlimited using Arma's highly customisable difficulty levels becomes a necessity. Fittingly, after Survive, you will die many, many times. That said, it's important to note that combat is more satisfying than before thanks to improved animations, smoother weapon handling and better optics - meaning the challenge stems from your opponents rather than clumsy controls and slow-to-aim weapons.  Adapt also changes the way you play. It gives you a squad to control, which is a mixed blessing. AI units tend to be much more perceptive of enemy locations than you are and are especially useful when facing down tanks and APCs, but they also require a fair amount of babysitting to keep them alive, and the lack of changes to Arma's squad commands means this can be a chore. Especially problematic is AI ammo management; your teammates go through bullets like a swarm of locusts through a corn crop, and resupplying them in the field is a nightmare in Arma 3's clumsy interface.  Alongside its story missions, which include the brilliant raid on Stratis described above, Adapt also introduces an open-world component. From your base you can go out on 'Patrol' and complete multiple optional objectives, from clearing enemy checkpoints to smoking out a sniper hidden inside a labyrinthine industrial complex, all while collecting weapons, ammo and equipment to use during the main missions - though the clunkiness of Arma's inventory management means this is less enjoyable than it should be. If you want to bring stuff back to base, you need to find a vehicle and load it item-by-item from your own inventory, while before each mission the game defaults to a standard equipment loadout and items you previously had can be lost in this process.  After the meatiness of Adapt, the final chapter Win feels fleeting by comparison, with only six missions to its name. But they're also the most spectacular, displaying vast, combined-arms battles that cover sweeping areas of Altis. It's strongly reminiscent of the opening of Operation Flashpoint, but with you in control rather than being led by an AI squad leader. In these closing stages you can call in devastating artillery strikes and helicopter assaults, simultaneously demonstrating the sheer destructive power of modern warfare and your own insignificance in the scale of things. Story-wise, it's also the most interesting segment, making unsettling use of its near-future setting and offering a branching conclusion that is fascinating, whichever direction you take.  Arma 3's campaign is a big, powerful, deeply engrossing thing, but there is one disappointment: its lack of vehicular missions. Since the story focuses on one not particularly interesting character who is ultimately a grunt, there are no tank missions, no helicopter missions and no jet missions. I can understand why, to a point: Arma's vehicles, especially its airborne offering, take time and effort to learn to control. Moreover, in these kinds of games infantry combat tends to be more enjoyable anyway. On the other hand, Flashpoint offered plenty of vehicle engagements during its campaign without any issue, and it's frustrating that, 13 years on, Arma's campaigns still lag behind it in terms of breadth of experience.  8/10",

You might be able to get some good mods on this game too (Battle Royale, Breaking point) that will only expand your game expierence. When you first start off your frames will be absolute crap, google stuff to find fixes, you just have to change some stuff in your game files. Stick to certain servers too. They may be the only ones with good frames/those cool guys you were playing with earlier.   All in all you gotta trust my review because i only write long reviews for games im passionate about.

The game engine is a great improvement over Arma 2 and looks every bit as good as Battlefield 3 &amp; 4 graphics but where this game really shines is its Modding support! Online mods like the day z and wasteland mods are such great fun and there are moments where you’re creeping through the woods or in valleys in the dark at night and you just feel this uneasy tension that you never know whose sights you could be in. I was a long-time fan of the Battelfield series but the DLC whoring has completely disenfranchised me from the series, it came to a point where any time I just wanted a quick game with friends I was forced to download stealth DLC that I was never going to purchase and it stealing valuable HDD space, therefore preventing me from playing at all even when 3 of us did have the latest patch, 3 of us couldn’t play anything but vanilla due to the fact we all had different DLC.  ARMA3 has been a breath of fresh air to me with loads of content available from the modding community I may even start modding this game myself because they have provided modding tools and actually support the modding community and listen to their concerns and address things that need fixing, Unlike other (we know better and are not interested game companies )  I can’t wait to see what awesome mods will come in the next few months.

Fully funcional star map. Sound travelling  (If your 300 meters from an explosion you will only hear it when its too late). and fully funcional vehicles  Next pro is the arsenal. you have around 50 weapons at your disposal which are fully customizeable with attachments. and thats not even counting mounted options like HMGs and Mortars.  Lots of control. If you can do it in real life theres probably a button for it in arma. theres even a salute button  Pleanty of vehicles. theres Tanks IFVs Helicopters, Jets, Submarines, Cars, APCs, Drones and more to play around with in arma   Now lets go over some cons  Its Really intimidating. this tacks onto one of the pros. theres lots of buttons to memorize and keep handy because you are going to need them ready for combat  Its expensive. Arma is an expensive game to buy but is also time expensive as you will need about a week or so to learn what everything does all of the buttons ECT  And finally we touch base on the DLC and the rather poor way it is presented. The DLC is not presented well. for instance. if your playing on a wasteland server and see a go kart but dont own the Karts DLC. well ♥♥♥♥ you because you cant drive it. or if you try to spawn in a helicopter in editor from helicopters and you dont own it. same issue. cant ♥♥♥♥ing drive it   Final verdict is Nutrel (Leaning a bit twards positive)  The game is amazing but the poor DLC model drags it down for me even though i own the dlc.  If your willing to give it some time to learn and make the investment you will love it",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

And if you try to use the quick join tactic it only tells you that your preferences or filter needs to be changed or something like that, and possibly the most useless DLC since Horse armor ( like markesmen DLC which gives you more sniper rifles, the Kart DLC which lets you play Mario Kart if Mario Kart had death at every corner, the heli DLC wich obviously gives you more helis, and last but NOT least is Apex which in this case is worth getting but its about $34.99 at the moment, it gives you a new map, new story, a bunch of guns, and a big and beatiful map called Tanoa with jungles and cool looking places all on a groupe of islands).   Though besides the DLC the game is still fun to play especially with friends, and the Mods oh man the mods :D are so good, like C.U.P's mod, World War II units , Esseker (though it only looks really good at higher settings and even at High its a bit laggy, though im pretty sure the creator made it to be played on Ultra anyway), and possibly the best Iron Front which is like World War II units but it gives you all the stuff of World War II like the tanks, planes, ships, etc.  Anyway if you have a ton of friends who like realistic games as much as you do and also like fighting eachother with armies of A.I in a pretty good looking game with epic mods and one epic but arguably outrageously priced DLC and with a cool 3D editor than this is the game for you.

First off Arma 3 isn't your normal First person shooter, This game takes skill, it isn't like Call of duty or Battlefield, ther isn't a rank system and there isn't an XP system. This is 100% millsim, You will throw out into a map that is massive beyhond any map you've ever seen. The combat is random at times and intense with no limit on 'fair gun play' Depending on what mode you play you and with who- you won't be shooting your gun a lot. this game takes a lot of time. The story mode is fun and gets you into some good basic combat along with a fair story line.   MP is full of mods and game modes set for almost everyone looking for either laid back game modes that you can hang out and play with your friends, or 100% tactical millsims that rage on for hours with strict Millitary commands and stratagys.   the editer is another great tool in this game, if you wanna try your skills in editing a mission or just playing down soilder to fight it out you can! The editer puts you in the driver seat for what you want to create!     Now lets talk about what you're gonna need for PC specs; first off forget the reccomended specs it's 100% BS   you're gonna wanna an Intel I5 or I7 first off, this game doesn't like AMD regadlesss of cores.  8GB of ram at the least! 12-16gb is best. And a GPU that can hold up to Armas insane looking graphics ( did i mention this game looks amazing?)    Sadly lagg and FPS drops are all to common in this game, even with my PC specs i get 15 20 frames in towns when small battles are going on.   BI never really optamized this game very well and it's really hurting us players who don't have enough money to dump on a new PC (i've been trying since this game came out toget it to run great, still trying)     so last lets do pros and cons     pros   -millsim tactics  -large multiplayter games  -many things to do from flying,boating,driving   -good story line with easy to get into modes  -realalistic battles with intense firefights    CONS  -poorly optamized   -too many mods on some servers causes issues  -easy to play, not easy to get use to/into     Honestly there isn't much i can say bad about this game. I really enjoy it and have a ton of fun playing it with all the freedom it gives you, if you got a good PC and wanna try something different. Buy Arma 3!",

Audio needs improvement. (Sometimes there is a helicopter above you making it difficult to hear dialogue.) The concept is really cool, but I think for a $40 price tag I expect fewer issues. There are better games for your money IMO.  Rating: 3/5",

I'm going to tell you what you SHOULD know RIGHT AWAY.  First off,DON'T ENTER THIS GAME TREATING IT LIKE CALL OF DUTY/BATTLEFIELD. This game is a LOT more realistic than 'shuut the gun and dey ded'. DON'T THINK YOU CAN JUST DIVE IN. This game has quite a large learning curve,so expect to die a lot at the start. If you want to practice,first do Bootcamp, then VR Training,then complete the campaign on Regular/Elite. You should be ready after that. Finally, DON'T ENTER THIS GAME TO PLAY NON 'ARMA' GAMEMODES.This means gamemodes like Breaking Point,Epoch,or Altis Life. These gamemodes,in my opinion, don't really represent what Bohemia was trying to achieve. Im not calling these gamemodes BAD,they're ♥♥♥♥ing great, I just think that you should also look at the 'Military Simulation' gamemodes,like Invade &amp; Annex, Co-operative missions or KOTH  Lets now do what I like to do when reviewing games, Categorize and Pro-Con-ize. Im a weird man.  WORLD DESIGN  +Big,but not big enough to make you bored of travelling +Diverse areas (Urban,Forests,Plains,Mountains) +Dynamic weather system (Fog can get to the point where you cant see 2 metres in front of you) -Too open (In my opinion. Needs more Woods and Urban areas)  GRAPHICS +♥♥♥♥ing Gorgeous +Very customizable -Demanding (If you dont have a good PC,expect 20-15fps)  GAMEPLAY +Excellent blend between realism and lots of action +Makes you afraid of just a war by how dangerous this game can be +Sometimes,I friendly fire because I thought that a teammate was AI (Yes,its that ♥♥♥♥ing good)  SINGLEPLAYER +Great as practice for new players -Not the best campaign i've seen  MULTIPLAYER +The most ♥♥♥♥ing diverse amount of gamemodes +Easy to find a favorite +Co-op missions with friends can be the funnest thing you will ever do -Most was community made (which is still great,but that means that Bohemia didn't really do any of the work,they just posted a bunch of categories)  COMMUNITY +Mods can range from better graphics to ♥♥♥♥ING DINOSAURS AND STAR WARS +Friendly,Respectful community that doesn't hate on noobs -Where there is good,evil tends to follow in its wake (Almost every server I've been on has had a troll on at least 2 times a day)  THE FINAL VERDICT  Buy this ♥♥♥♥ing game. Do you like Military?BUY IT. Realism? BUY IT. Role-playing?BUY IT.This has become my favorite game of all time,and the only thing that I think will beat it is ArmA IV.  BUY  THIS  GAME",

My main interest in Arma games was always the mil sim part (not interested in any rpg/zombie modes) and so far A2 OA is the best for that. Sadly Bohemia got creative and put the A3 in the near future, with more futuristic forces what pretty much killed the 'realistic mil sim' part for me. But still A3 is a great game. It's unbelievably moddable so I was able to get my modern military fix quickly with user created units.  So, the good: -upgraded graphics engine -gigantic map -bipods! Yea, after few years they put bipods in game! -shooting from vehicles - same as with bipods - finally! -new more smooth and natural animations -game is super moddable -as usual great mission editor (I pretty much spent all my time creating my own missions). -driving is way more enjoyable than in any prev Armas  Now the bad: -no female soldiers/civilians -(if COD could we can too) -insane gun swaying and bobbing, gets infuriating -stamina - your soldier will fall on his face after running for 10 seconds -compare to A2 not that many various units -still no tank/apc interiors -lots of people reporting insane lag/fps issues MP and SP.  Its a great game, and you can pretty much mod it to whatever you want - rpg/zombies/survival (blah...booring)/ military ops/racing- peek your fix. Still, if you are looking only for realistic military sim - get Arma 2 Operation Arrowhead and put the ACE mod into it - it will be insanely good and sadly better experience than A3. Great game, sadly not the best in the Arma franchise. ",

It is more complex than the usual big-name games like Call of Duty and Battlefield, making the learning curve potentially intimidating for beginners. In reality, however, if you can handle typical FPS games, you can figure out the basics of Arma 3 in about a week. The reward of sticking with it is immersion in massive, beautiful, outdoor environments (the smaller island of the two is about 20 km² while the larger one is 270 km²), tactical play, and epic encounters.  There is something different about scrambling for cover as you're being shot at by an enemy patrol, and not knowing where it's coming from -- and then after you find out, having to use compass readings to share that knowledge with your teammates. It's also incredibly fun to take an AI squad under your command close to an enemy position, assigning targets to them individually, and then ordering them all to open fire at the same time on the unsuspecting soldiers.  Notwithstanding all of this, quite possibly the best part of Arma 3 is its open nature. While you'll probably enjoy playing the stock Escape missions, you'll soon discover that there is a treasure trove of custom scenarios created by the community. This is one game that is worth the price just for the community creations alone.",

            "review_text": "Ill get into the fps and system specs first, then the graphics, gameplay, and my opinion on the game. The game's fps drasticly changes depending on what server and if you're using any mods, and the action that's going on in your server, my game usually runs from around 20 to 70 fps. The 20fps can happen if there's alot of action around, with explosions, vehicles driving around, helicopters and jets flying. This is the performance i have on: Intel i3-6100 @3.70Ghz(4cpus), 8GB RAM, Geforce GTX 750ti, MSI B150 gaming M3 motherboard. I get that fps on kind of medium-high graphics, i have some settings on ultra, but some on low. I've found that to work for me the best. The game overall looks beutifull, depending on the map and server render distance limitations. The gameplay is highly customizable, litteraly you can make any mission, and find mods, for any type of situation you want to play, or any kind of operation you want to do, though this needs a good editor or editing team. The game is great, especially with mods, the base game, after around 200 hours seems very plain, and has nothing new to offer, the dlc isnt good, the dev's dont make the dlc and new updates compactible with mods, and thus making problems for highly modded servers, the game itself with mods, is playable very long, friends to play with is a bonus, and deffinetly makes everything more fun and interesting, but its not a necesity, you can play solo too, though it will deffinetly get boring faster than with friends. I recommend everyone to try this, but dont purchase the dlc's they're not worth it, if you are sure that you will use them and/or need them, only then purchase them, becuse the updates of the game are free, only some useless content which the dlc add's, that could be aquired via mods months before.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ As of October 2016, i can barely reccomend this game due to the actions of its developer, apex dlc which they released at the price of 30Euro, is very much the most overpriced dlc i've ever seen, it does not offer content for the price that it asks, 21/10/16 Just saw that they're releasing 5 more dlc's in 2017, 1 of them will be free, which dosent matter becuse it probably will be ♥♥♥♥. Jets Dlc, 'Orange' Dlc, Malden 'free' dlc, tac-ops Dlc, Tanks Dlc,  i cannot express how bad this is, instead of updating the game with fixes and optimization updates, they create dlc similiar to Payday 2's developer - Overkill, which is very bad, if it does go down to the point where dlc's are more than the base game itself can offer, it will become a pay to play game similiar to World of warcraft or skyrim online, where you need to pay every month to play, surely you wont need to pay every month, but the dlc seemingly will fall into your lap and ask you to buy them, bassicly vets of arma 2 and now arma 3 players will feel the need to buy these becuse of the simple fact that the previous dlc didnt offer as much as it should, bassicly resulting in an endless DLC spam from the devs instead of updating and adding content to the base game. If you do not have the dlc you will be recieving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ad's all around the game you payed allready for, for example, driving in any other seat than driver seat in any apex vehicle, or using any apex gear, such as the re-skinned vests or uniforms. Also commenting this fact on the roadmap announcment in steam, i was banned for 5 days and my comment was deleted, even though the game is rated 16+ and rated with bad lenguage, so i dont understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with this bias that the devs are trying to make out of arma 3. Its sad, i really enjoyed arma 2 with barely any dlc, if these dlc's result in me not being able to fully enjoy this game, the dlc will come, but ill go.",

OH and btw, the AI have a 90% chance of a headshot on you making them kill you instanstly almost everytime. Especially annoying when ARma decided to put a death limit on the missions...",

            "review_text": "Ill get into the fps and system specs first, then the graphics, gameplay, and my opinion on the game. The game's fps drasticly changes depending on what server and if you're using any mods, and the action that's going on in your server, my game usually runs from around 20 to 70 fps. The 20fps can happen if there's alot of action around, with explosions, vehicles driving around, helicopters and jets flying. This is the performance i have on: Intel i3-6100 @3.70Ghz(4cpus), 8GB RAM, Geforce GTX 750ti, MSI B150 gaming M3 motherboard. I get that fps on kind of medium-high graphics, i have some settings on ultra, but some on low. I've found that to work for me the best. The game overall looks beutifull, depending on the map and server render distance limitations. The gameplay is highly customizable, litteraly you can make any mission, and find mods, for any type of situation you want to play, or any kind of operation you want to do, though this needs a good editor or editing team. The game is great, especially with mods, the base game, after around 200 hours seems very plain, and has nothing new to offer, the dlc isnt good, the dev's dont make the dlc and new updates compactible with mods, and thus making problems for highly modded servers, the game itself with mods, is playable very long, friends to play with is a bonus, and deffinetly makes everything more fun and interesting, but its not a necesity, you can play solo too, though it will deffinetly get boring faster than with friends. I recommend everyone to try this, but dont purchase the dlc's they're not worth it, if you are sure that you will use them and/or need them, only then purchase them, becuse the updates of the game are free, only some useless content which the dlc add's, that could be aquired via mods months before.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ As of October 2016, i can barely reccomend this game due to the actions of its developer, apex dlc which they released at the price of 30Euro, is very much the most overpriced dlc i've ever seen, it does not offer content for the price that it asks, 21/10/16 Just saw that they're releasing 5 more dlc's in 2017, 1 of them will be free, which dosent matter becuse it probably will be ♥♥♥♥. Jets Dlc, 'Orange' Dlc, Malden 'free' dlc, tac-ops Dlc, Tanks Dlc,  i cannot express how bad this is, instead of updating the game with fixes and optimization updates, they create dlc similiar to Payday 2's developer - Overkill, which is very bad, if it does go down to the point where dlc's are more than the base game itself can offer, it will become a pay to play game similiar to World of warcraft or skyrim online, where you need to pay every month to play, surely you wont need to pay every month, but the dlc seemingly will fall into your lap and ask you to buy them, bassicly vets of arma 2 and now arma 3 players will feel the need to buy these becuse of the simple fact that the previous dlc didnt offer as much as it should, bassicly resulting in an endless DLC spam from the devs instead of updating and adding content to the base game. If you do not have the dlc you will be recieving ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ad's all around the game you payed allready for, for example, driving in any other seat than driver seat in any apex vehicle, or using any apex gear, such as the re-skinned vests or uniforms. Also commenting this fact on the roadmap announcment in steam, i was banned for 5 days and my comment was deleted, even though the game is rated 16+ and rated with bad lenguage, so i dont understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is up with this bias that the devs are trying to make out of arma 3. Its sad, i really enjoyed arma 2 with barely any dlc, if these dlc's result in me not being able to fully enjoy this game, the dlc will come, but ill go.",

I take off (not knowing what to do at all) I manage to get it flying and I head towards the capture zone and I got too low to the ground and smacked into a telephone poll and some how the heli survives and all the 30-year-olds are like good job on that landing , then I reply saying 'idk how I did that, I literally have no idea what I'm doing, I just bought the game'. So for some reason, people kept on getting in my heli and I got better at flying and got the nick name the Nye Airlines (my name at the time in arma was just Bill Nye) and to this day forward the nye airlines lives on.   doggo/10 would fly a heli into a pole again",

I played and greatly enjoyed the Operation Flashpoint games Dragon Rising and Red River, but felt they had too much of a mainstream Call of Duty-esque to them. Especially Red River. While Arma 3 has a decent storyline, the character development isn't there. The main character has little to grow on and other characters while ok, could use some more backstory. Probably the most interesting is SSG Adams.   Weapon usage, ballistics, and sounds have improved since first released. And it's all welcomed to me. Originally broken up into 3 parts, the latest patch makes it all one long story. I love the first and second parts, 'Survive' and 'Win' respectively. Though they are shorter than 'Adapt.' Win being the shortest with fewer 'cut scenes' than the others. But with the extensive open world, multitude of showcases, and huge multiplayer (which I have not experienced), it has more content than most games come with in an entire DLC season pass. BI has done an awesome job and didn't just give up on it. I highly recommend this came to anyone!",

The game is graphically gorgeous. Has some of the best lighting effects I've seen since Metro.  On the downside. Your character fatigue is ridiculous. For being a simulator you will immediately die if shot. But on the other hand you have to shoot the AI several times before they will. The game can be very complicated at times if you're not familiar with this like myself. All in all it's a very good game if you're willing to put the time and effort to learn everything.",

Let's start with the absolutely horrendous framerate, this is not something based in inadequate hardware. Once you start playing on a server, you may notice 100+ fps, things are moving along nicely. This means you managed to strike gold, and entered a freshly booted server. As soon as you get into a small community, the framerate drops. To insanely low levels. &lt;45 fps is hardly uncommon. This happens on every single server. Once the server is rebooted, your 100&lt; fps is back. This is of course just the tip of the iceberg. Every single staircase, on all three maps, will ♥♥♥♥ you up. You get stuck in them, you teleport around, you fall through them. Amazing stuff when you're running up a tower while being shot by everyone, including their grandmas.  Once we've started handling this, usually rememdied by running in fully standing position, you're still getting rubber band lag and all kinds of incontrollable spastic movement. Amazing. But here's the real piece of the pie - the server browser is the worst browser I've EVER had to handle. Not only does it send you flying to another server when you select one, but refreshing the server list, even with decent constraints, it's a major gamble. Will you find ANY server at all? Probably not. Okay, let's restart the server browser then. No. Of course not, you have to restart the whole ♥♥♥♥ing game to even have a chance. But no, usually you still find absolutely nothing, what so ever. Okay, so you give up, and decide that 40 minutes of trying to enter a server is way too much. OH hell, look, ARMA 3 keeps running, even though you closed it 5 minutes ago. And you've suddenly got no internet connection. Supposedly this is due to some overloading of routers, but have fun trying to solve that issue. Nothing helps. You just need to wait it out. Or reset your router. Or restart your computer.. Nothing helps in any consistent manner.  I love the gameplay, I love the slow paced sniping and the huge amounts of features. Too bad you can't ♥♥♥♥ing play it.",

We may love and enjoy the only one playable milsim in Steam, but still there's much to improve.  Game got it's 90% positive reviews just in case of the fact that there aren't many   good   milsims to compare to Arma.  By the way, instead of improvements that are   really needed   , dear Bohemia made DLC's. Hopefully, we have waited only 1,5 years for bipods. And here comes Apex DLC, with much more, really much more improvements that should have been in-game since 2013.   And don't be lazy guys, check out the price of Apex and recognize that it's more expensive than game itself in 2013.   Yes yes. ~~~ I bet people would by 60$ optimization DLC instead of that. The problem of engine is that lags don't come from high graphic settings. They come from view distance setting, which have to be set low to play with normal fps. However, singleplayer doesn't lag so much, so you have to choose:  ~~~№1: Play with the dumbest AI ever in SP missions without lags.  ~~~№2: Play multiplayer with the most terrific lags ever. Most servers use mods, which make even more lags.      Other hateful sh!t:    For the memory of the brave soldiers who have died being stucked in a fence. Somebody, kill the 'v' button.  You can heal youself infinite times in vanilla. Just like in real life, medkits set you HP to 75%.  Who cares about that you can sprint half a minute with 15kg machine gun?  Ah, we have AP and HP ammo in every game, but hell yes, not here, in the best milsim of our universe.  Oh cr*p, you can't normally reload weapon in vehicle. You even can't change the seat.  Very realistic radar, really.  Tell us that hero, who has made realistic helicopter physics with 1 second delay for engine power control, turning your helicopter flight in a 999 ping simulation.  This game don't have realistic physics for planes. Not sure if I should be happy about this or not.  Bohemia was brave enough not to use the nodegraph for AI. Sure, it's impossible to put nodegraph on 270km^2 map, but guys, bots are stuck only in towns. Wasn't it hard to make nodegraph in those little settlements? All of us know, that if we'll make NPC drive through whole Altis on a truck, it will spend 40% of time bumping random garbage can or house before it reach it's destination point.   Sure, you know that AI has other problems as well, because sniper NPC still can't make a single hit with his GM6 Lynx from 400m, but can pistolsnipe you from the same distance.  Another trouble is low basic content. You gonna say this game has it's awesome mods, and be sure, you're right. Despite the fact that that must-have mods won't work after every update. And they're still unstable.  To be sure, how great vanilla is, check out if there are any servers without mods, and tell me later, how much in % you've found.  People are judging physics, but it seems that no one noticed this dumb recoil system, an more, even dumber penetration system in ballistics for vehicles, I hope fellow WOT or WT players will understand what I'm talking about.   Be sure, everyone LOVES scrolling mouse3 to change a gun!  NPC walks through stones.  It's fixed now, but I remember those times NPC couldn't drive on a brigde.  100% of civilian popualtion are wierd 20yo men. No children, no old people, no women.  You can shoot out armoured glass with SMG.  We certainly enjoy control system.  Please tell me, how NPC survive after 12,7mm shot.  NPC don't care for driving over their mates with an APC.  Anyone remember those times, when NPC teamkilled you if you've crashed UAV?  Guns don't have safe mode. (Mods gonna help you)    Do you already have stairs phobia? Because they gonna come to you at night and make you fall though the Earth to the south pole .    B*tthurt is over.  ",

So if you get into this game being all like 'Yeah, this is what war is like, this is realistic and really precise' Then sorry. You need to get out in the real world pall. Because I don't consider a game that when you shoot the enemy in the head they are able to do a 180 turn and shoot you 3 times in the head before dying very realistic. Same goes for boosting of stairs when walking down from them to quickly and breaking your legs.   This game is however one of the funniest games I have ever played with friends. The amount of vehicles, the guns, the destructible enviorment. The overall map is not to shabby either.   If you get this game for fun gags with friends and just cause overall chaos then this game is perfect for that.  If you get it to play it as a serious war game then i'd say the clunky motions and faulty A.I ruins that emediatly",

Not even two seconds later, there's a sniper round that hits the wall next to me. So I freaking book it about 200meters into these tall bushes. I have ghille camo on, right? I should be safe.

We expected the next generation of Windows: we just didn't expect it to be called Windows 10. None the less here is Windows 10: the next Windows OS for PCs and laptops, smartphones and tablets. And, indeed, an OS for servers and all points inbetween. Microsoft said that Windows 10 is built from the ground up for a world in which mobile- and cloud computing are key. Execs from the company said it was committed to making Windows 10 friendly for the enterprise, ideal for keyboard and mouse users, but also optimised for touch. Oh, and Windows 10 will put the same interface on devices with displays ranging in size from 4in to 80in. 'One product family, one platform, one store,' says Microsoft.  Given the lukewarm reaction to compromised Windows 8, these seem like bold claims. They are necessary, though.Also necessary is Microsoft's decision to make Windows 10 the most beta-tested product it has ever released. Windows 10 was tested by over 4 million people around the world before its launch. That doesn't mean it's perfect - indeed some people won't like the privacy issues (see far below) or the forced updates. Others won't like the new Start menu or the fact that there's now both a Control Panel and separate Settings app. But these won't be issues for most people - minor gripes at worst - and the improvements, new apps and new features make it well worth upgrading. For more detail on this, see: Should I upgrade to Windows 10?",

Peel and finely slice the garlic, then peel and matchstick the ginger. Trim and finely slice the spring onions, deseed and finely slice the chilli and cut the lime into wedges. Trim, peel and thinly slice the carrots at an angle.  2. Cut the broccoli into small florets, then finely shred the stalk, discarding any gnarly bits. Cut the chicken into 1cm strips. Cook the noodles according to packet instructions, then drain and refresh under cold water. Drain again, toss in a little oil and put to one side. Lightly toast the cashew nuts in a non-stick frying pan until golden, then tip onto a plate to cool.  3. Heat 1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a large frying pan or wok. Season the chicken with a pinch of pepper, then add to the pan and stir-fry for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden. Add the coriander stalks, garlic and ginger and cook for a further minute.  4. Next, add the spring onions, carrots and broccoli and stir-fry for a further 2 minutes, then add the cooked noodles. Keep stir-frying until the noodles are warm and the chicken is cooked through. Stir through the soy and fish sauces, then remove from the heat.  5. Divide between bowls, sprinkle over the nuts, sliced chilli and the reserved coriander leaves, then serve with the lime wedges for squeezing over.  ",

The tutorials are called 'showcases', which is not at all helpful or descriptive. If you're coming to this for the first time you'll likely make the same mistake I did and try to do the campaign first.   The sim itself is insanely hard. The realism means you'll often come under almost instantly lethal fire from shooters who are completely invisible to you, and that's just in the tutorials. Even when you can see the enemy, they're often dots on the horizon who can nevertheless pick you off behind cover with unerring accuracy.   Ammo is incredibly restricted, meaning I was actually glad when one of my team got killed because it meant I could resupply. There may be a way to get resupplied without your teamates dying, but like so much of this game, it is not obvious how to accomplish that.   The controls are far from intuitive. It took me the better part of an hour and some editing of the control menu to get the gun optics to actually come up reliably when I clicked the right mouse button. Much of what you are supposed to do happens through the 'order menu.' I think you're meant to use this (maybe? again, it isn't clear) to order NPC team members to do stuff, like attack a particular target, but it is far too unweildy to use in combat. To select the 'order menu' you have to press '0' or '~'. '~' didn't work and the font chosen means it isn't obvious if you should be typing 'o' 'O' or '0'. It's zero, btw, but zero on the number keys at the top of the keyboard. Zero on the keypad does something else. The keys can also do different things when modified by alt and ctrl. In the middle of a firefight. Where you die instantly to targets you can't see.  Navigation seems straight forward until you try and apply it and realise that waypoints don't actually appear in your HUD, or maybe they do and I just don't know which button/menu item to select to make them visible.   Even the inventory system is overly complex. If you try and loot a corpse you have to loot each individual part of their kit separately (clothing, webbing and pack). Not realising this for the first hour and a half contributed substantially to my shortage of ammo.  I've tried the campaign and the first 2 showcases. I can't complete the 2nd showcase, because on the rare occasions I don't get insta-killed by the hostiles, the anti-aircraft missile is unguided and I don't have the knack for hitting moving targets with it.   I've died at least 100 times so far, &gt;20 of those to land mines, which are also invisible.  A punishing exercise in misery and frustration. Not recommended.",

Even battle royal is a slow paced drag while you wait to get shot at. Took me a good 2 hours to get the controls into even a basic layout to play, that was without touching any air or sea vehicles.  -Overly complicated controls -Horribly slow game play -Inventory control is stupid, you have to switch between 3 tabs because you have 3 places to put your items.  -Does have decent graphics -They did make it the most realistic combat simulator in the world, because like the real world war is 99% walking, waiting, 1% gun fights.",

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

            "review_text": "I was really hopeful about ARMA. As it is, it was pretty lame. Maybe it'd be better if I had a super fast computer, AND everyone had the fastest internet known to mankind. It is almost as realistic as WarThunder, but jumpy, jagged, and with laggy multiplayer. Some say the controls are confusing, but I don't agree. The controls are a little different, but you get used to them fairly quickly. Some of the confusion comes from putting more than one action with the same button, switching based on whether it is a tap or a hold. I referenced the controls menu a bunch, but there are numerous tutorials, guides, training scenarios and other practice available right in the game.   I really appreciate how realistic it is in that there are no markers for the enemy, and it only takes a couple of hits to kill you. Unfortunately, it always takes at least 4 bullets to kill an enemy. Unless you hit the face. The helmet will not do, you must hit the face or neck. This is actually pretty hard to do when you are at distances of 100+m, which you usually are engaging at those distances +/- 50m, and when they shoot more accurately than you because you have been walking/running everywhere and thus have less fatigue. Avoid ever sprinting, even though the map is bigger than any map in any other game you've ever played in, just be patient and take 2-4 minutes to walk to the next battle. 'If you run, you'll just die tired'.    I went into a multiplayer game and saw helicopters flying around in crazy upside down positions, crashing and falling to the ground. Perhaps a contributing factor was the fact that it was a 70+ person game. When I joined, I saw in the chat room that players were complaining about the lag, as I quickly downloaded a 3.4 MB setting file from the server. Obviously, my joining the game clogged their upstream pipe. This happened a couple times in the game as new players joined, lag spiked. Perhaps a fix of this could be a download mirror used for all servers, or something to save on server bandwidth.  This game made me laugh at how unpolished it was at several points. Mostly this was for multiplayer lag jumps, but it was funny when I tried my first multiplayer mission and my trooper, who was not the squad leader, would not stop calling out orders to everyone every 10 seconds. I tried figuring out why I was issuing all these commands, but it happened without my pressing buttons or anything close to the squad command buttons. It was also funny because the in-game voice chat toggle button defaults to [Caps Lock], so when I returned to typing out messages they were SHOUTING HALF THE TIME. Oops. I couldnt figure out how to stop ordering everyone to regroup with me, nor could I find the enemy (it was a co-op mission), so I decided to try something else. In my second multiplayer game, I was starting to get the hang of it. I died plenty at first, sure, but there was always a nice helicopter pilot ready to take us to the battlefield when I respawned. I'm REALLY GLAD I didn't have to walk all that way, because if I did, once would have been enough for me to quit. I was starting to get the hang of it, and even a few kills. Someone finally got me while from a higher building, and I was returning to the battlefield in a helicopter. I started typing to my teammates while riding in the heli, and even though I was typing a message, when I used spacebar during the message, it caused me to jump out of the helicopter without a parachute. I died before I could finish typing out my question, but in a way it answered a different one. I decided to stop playing multiplayer and try the campaign.    In the first mission it was funny to have an enemy blazing away full tilt at my essential NPC partner, and for him to not even notice the enemy was there, walking on by. I would have preferred my AI teammate to actually engage the enemy, but I'm sure walking up and shoulder checking him as he walked by was pretty effective. In the same mission, I snuck up on a machine gunner in the same first mission and wanted to see what the 'action' button would do when I got close. It turns out, instead of knifing him or doing some other crazy-cool CQB maneuver, I pulled out my medical kit and started bandaging him while he turned his MG on my face and opened up. In the second mission, I wasn't able to progress because one member of my squad spotted an MRAP that he REALLY wanted me to destroy, even when our mission didn't call for it. The rest of our squad was fine to go to the Rendezvous point, but that NPC squad member kept yelling for us to take out the group of enemies by it. The squad leader kept yelling for him to return to formation, and I just kept walking through the forest for a while, hoping that he'd return at the next script line for the story. He didn't. I ended up going back to the last autosave and taking out the rest of them, by myself (after 20+ tries), without backup. I was a little glad I did, because when allies engage the enemy, they die as fast as the enemy does. Which is as fast as you do. Which is QUICK. I never neded up finishing that mission, because even when I knew generally where the enemy was coming from, I couldn't see them to shoot them. But they sure could see and shoot me through all the leaves and bushes in the forest. I died over and over. I'm sure it was a bit like 'Nam, and just as fun. So I decided to uninstall.  If it weren't for that, the campaign at least has great production value, on par with Call of Duty. The voice acting, scripting of scenes, and music all are top notch. It is ready for Oculus IR, and maybe I'd enjoy it more if I had a computer that wasn't at least 6 years old. I am usually a simulation enthusiast, loving realism even over gameplay (hey, I like WarThunder, where you also have a hard time identifying who is an enemy and you die in 1-2 hits). However, this was just not very enjoyable. ARMA is like fighting on 3 or 4 battlefield 3 maps at once, with 100 players. That sounds fun, and it could be. As it is, however, it tries to do entirely too much (for my computer). It ends up being a laggy, frustrating mess. It'd be fun at a convention, on a LAN, with computers with monster video cards, because the draw distance is intense. But I was frustrated, not having fun, and ready to uninstall after just a few hours.",

In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg. 2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla. 3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat. 4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed 5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed. 6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more, being careful not to burn toppings.",

Let's start with a brief overview with the games problems:  1. The game runs about as good as a starving albino ethiopian.  2. The controls/character movement is clunky. I feel like I have to dust off my knees before I can actually run again after proning. 3. The character movement feels unpolished, unnatural and clunky. eg jumping, running, proning (everything ffs). 4. For cars you don't open the door you actually teleport inside. Sad for such a resource hungry game. 5. Driving feels unnatural, laggy and just poorly implemented. Again Sad for such a resource hungry game. 6. The Physics in the game are horrible. Crashing in a Vehicle doesn't feel right. Nothing feels right at all in this game. 7. Netcode is absolutely disgraceful. 8. The price is an absolute rip off for this clunky explosive miscarriage of a game and yet you still charge me for DLC's  After all this time to develope this game it still feels unfinished and unpolished. I don't know what Bohemia actually works on. Like all this time and you can't even get the main fundamentals of the game feeling right. eg running, crouching, proning, shooting, aiming, driving (♥♥♥♥ing everything). The performance is soooo ♥♥♥♥ing poor like honestly what sucks up all the power. I teleport into the ♥♥♥♥ing vehicles I enter and I only get 30 fps on all low settings with a $3000 rig I can't even be bothered saying the specifications on because it is pointless since countless people have already stated the poor performance of the monstrosity. This game is not even visually that amazing. The amount I have to render is nothing out of the orginary. I don't know how but you have managed to sell millions of copies of this game to people. I think it is mainly because of the unique concept, the great community and the player made content. The players and the unique roleplay experience is the only thing that keeps this game alive. It could be so much better. It disgusts me to actually charge for DLC content of such an unfinished, unpolished game. So much money must have been put towards nothing. All the updates over the years must have been on stupid ♥♥♥♥ like the clouds in the game. Please just get the fundamentals right before updating unneccesary ♥♥♥♥.

What they wont show you or tell you is how BAD AND DISGUSTING it is, Example you're driving a main battle tank, you deside to drive through a small less than a meter high wooden fence. the tank maybe or will either 80% chance, 1# break, 2# blow up 3# become badly damage, 4# become partially damage 5# you take health damage   same with driving it into a bush or a tree, same with cars, oh and you can't drive road baries over or the run way ones.. you'll just blow up lol  same with the off-roaders and massive trucks....   Top cons about this game   Disguse  Physx Lack of trucks/tanks/fixed-wings - fixed wings ' planes ' badly made, they tilt like hell wont even fly in straight line can't call airstrikes or support like - Arma 2 or Arma OA Missions are crap and short... Delux and Limited edition - Thought they said all DLCS free. this is a scam and a lie you've got to pay for carts..    Good things?

Also, if you are no a fan of the military games than this game offers you lots of 'less military' mods, for example, arma 3 life- this mod simulates what life is like and you canplay this all through arma 3.

I would personally not recommend this to people for many reasons: 1.Graphics problems are very relevant, most of the time the amazing graphics are only loaded in a small radius around your character. When ever a scope or sight is used you can see a good distance but the terrain looks like it came from an old Atari game. 2. This game is OVERLY realistic, the features like fatigue from running are very cool and something that impressed me at first, then began to ruin the game play because by the time you reach any enemy soldiers your character can't aim even when in the prone position, added to that is even on the easiest settings (for AI and character) the player can only take around 4 hits where as the computer characters can take around 10 or so hits to die. 3. The story line for the campaign does not have the diversity of games like Battlefield or Call of Duty. In the first section of the campaign you are consonantly going to and from the main base, there are certain sections of the campaign missions where you might get to fly a UAV or drive, but those are few and far between. These are the main reasons why I wouldn't suggest this game to other people, if you have played alot of Battlefield or Call of Duty this is most likely not the game for you, but if you like hardcore strategy and realistic MILSIM games this is the game for you. My suggestion is wait until this game is on a good sale (50% or more) because there is a high chance that alot of player may not enjoy the difficulty of this game.",

Considering that not only you get the main game (Army simulator), but you can get many more mods (for free ofc), which are so much fun. For example Battle Royal, which is the mod leaving you and lot of other players on a n island, where you have to find a weapon, and kill everyone else to win (basicaly same as in the movie hunger games, or battle royale). Another one breaking point is the one familiar to dayz. Or there is a role playing mode where you are thrown into the city, and only you choose whether you are going to be criminal, or cop, or doctor, or anyone else.  Thing about this game is that its engine is really open for comunity to make its own modifications of the game. This game is based on comunity, so if you are bored of regular deathmatch shooters, and want to play shooter with more realistic atmosphere and better interaction with people, there is not better game for this pupose.   And if you didnt actually get what i ment by this long boring review, just google a little bit and try to find many exciting mods that exist, or are in development.  Shortly... if Gaben gives you sale on ARMA III, GO FOR IT, you wont regret the money you will spend.",

The ArmA series is known for having a really strong modding community, this is thanks to the support and the encouragment from the developers of the game.  There aren't really many problems with this game and the few problems that it does have dont really affect gameplay and if a bug is found the community generally makes it know really quickly helping the developers find the problem and fix it really quickly. With all the bugs getting fixed so quickly and the problems with the game being so small this leaves a great amount of time for the developers to add more to the game making it greater.   Overall this game is really fun and really intresting and you cant really run out of things to do with all the mods that are made for the game (Epoch, A3 Life and more). The ArmA series is also the origination of the DayZ game.",

The main problem with this game is that a lot of the content is hard to find for the average user.

That's not to say that you have to join a community to have fun in this game, there's tons of mods that can be played as well--I'm strictly speaking about the base game--it is not that fun when playing with randoms, you need a heirachical structure issuing commands and also squad based tactics (no ♥♥♥♥, like an actual military) to experience this game in its true light.  Some popular mods are: Altis Life (roleplaying game where you roleplay real life in the game, stay away if you don't have a mic please) Battle Royale (much like the movie, you get dumped on an island with nothing and have to be the last man standing) DayZ Epoch (Some people prefer it to DayZ Standalone, it's a fan mod)",

It is an easy game to get to grips with the basic movements but takes time to learn and master some of the extra functions you have. Grpaphics and game play are superb and smooth. I never notice any lag. The open style field of operations is huge. There are many weapons and vehicles to use. It is more akin to Battlefield than COD. You are in squads with soldiers of different skills. You have pilots, medics, marksmen, engineers and infantry. You need a pilot to fly the choppers - you cant all do everything. so it is a true co-op. What I prefered with this game over Battlefield is the CO-OP elelment of the game is humans against AI. This meant I did not take 15 mins to arrive at a battle with my level 1 peashooter only to be oblitorated by a soldier with a personal nuclear warhead! I believe there are Humans V Human servers too but I never tried these. This gives the novice time to experiment with the game and equipment. There is also an effective boot camp to train you before combat. I have only scratched the surface of what there is to learn. I will buy the game based on the co-op missions alone. You need time to play the game. It is not a 30 min game to play before bed!",

The game is definitely awesome if you know what you're doing and become experienced, but unfortunately it is terrible for new players who do not know how to play just yet.  As a new player, even if you go through the bootcamp, you still have a hard time communicating with other teammates. You will find yourself in a car with other players who take you nowhere, or otherwise you'll drive a car with other teammates and take them nowhere useful.  The fatigue (stamina) system, while realistic, is giving players who have no vehicle a very hard time because they have to walk their way through.  Attending the action takes a long time. Transportation may take up to 10 minutes (WITH a vehicle) and when you arrive at the battlefield you might just die within moments, making all your efforts of arriving WORTHLESS.  This means one can not just come in for 20-30 minutes of gameplay. It takes at least one hour in a row to enjoy a multiplayer session.  All in all, Arma 3 can be an awesome game if you have enough time to become fully familiar with it and also have plenty of free time to play.",

As you may know, this is not Kansas anymore. This is a WAR simulator. War. Like in: big scale combat simulator. You'll see tanks, planes and infantry fighting, awesome game mechanics to simulate situations, steath and other things but it is a lot different from BF4 or Call of Duty. Hell... these games don't even belong to this review. It's simply different. If you 'die', a lot of things can happens and respawn is almost never friendly.  This is all I can say about the 'capital' of the core game, vanilla, single-player: it's a unforgiving, beautiful combat simulator and no matter what other people say, this is as real as it can get (without mods, of course).  Now, let's talk about the Multiplayer and Mods. Well, you know DayZ, right? That's one of the most limited mods avaiable for Arma. You need to search for mods like:  -Epoch (Overpoch): Where Minecraft meets DayZ. You'll explore, find loot, build bases and eventualy die in a fire. -Altis Life (kind of defunct): Drive cars in a island like a normal person. Expect police, terrorists and drug dealers. It's a lot of fun! -King of The Hill: Battlefield meets Arma in this amazing multiplayer, multifaction combat simulator. Capture cities, use vehicles and have tons of fun with up to 120 players in a single map! -Wastland Mod: Three factions battle for the control of an persisting island. Find a squad, play with vehicles and kill the other players.  Ok, I'm not putting a lot of effort on this simply because each mod is a new universe. The number of server-side customizations make the game simply huge. If you buy it, I know you'll find a mod that makes you happy.

Singleplayer is lame, There are a lot of broken missions in it, search for 'UAV mission' 'how to avoid mortars in tipping a hit' etc. Multiplayer is lame, You can't even find a normal server that has tanks and helicopter and stuff. 95% of the servers run an 'rpg' mode which is a rip off of gta. The other mode is 'wasteland mode' which is basically dayz without zombies. I'd also call it a dayz rip off but it was created before dayz. heh I can understand why they created dayz cuz that mode sucks too.  Not to mention that 90% of the servers are over 600 ping if you're from europe. Some servers even kick you because your nick is too short. LOL right ? thats true. and most of the servers require a password to enter.  Edit : Hit registration is also horrible sadly, if you've played king of the hill, you know how bad the registration is, 30 rounds full mag shot at someone 10 meters away and they almost stay alive. At far distances, when people prone, it looks like they go into the dirt because the plants and stuff doesn't render at long range, this makes long range combats incredibly frustrating. My review is still negative sadly. I'm playing almost every mod and workshop maps to find a good aspect but it really is so hard to do it, the game feels sooo clunky. Plus zeroing pretty much sucks most of the time. Let me give an example ; I was on a hill and I saw a guy at 400 meters, I zeroed my rifle to 400 (note that he was on a building and we were at the same elevation) and shot at him, guess what bullet goes 2 meters above him.   Well THAT is the final ♥♥♥♥ ! In the king of the hill gamemode I said before, you level up, and it takes a ♥♥♥♥ ton of time to do so. I was about level 32, and then I went to steam workshop to download some scenaries to see if the game is succesful at those single/co op player missions, well it is kinda OK BUT WHEN I WENT BACK TO KING OF THE HILL I WAS LEVEL 1 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T I DIDN'T DELETE A GOD DAMN THINK 10/10 UNINSTALL WAS THE ONLY SMOOTH THING ABOUT THE CLUNKY MOVEMENT SIMULATOR.",

            "review_text": "Okay, let me just go ahead and get this out of the way, this is not anything like COD, Battlefield, or most other major Shooters. This is a simulation of war at its very finest. With a HUGE amount of variation with weapons, vehicles, and even character customization. However, the game isn't focused around mechanics entirely. It has a 3 part campaign (Survive, Adapt, and Win, four if you count the Prologue campaign.) You can add even more to that list with community made content from the Workshop. There is a fully functional editor so you can create your own Scenarios with. ( If you're new to the series, you might have some problems with the editor at first, but you will start to understand eventually. )  My only gripe with the game is that their is a massive learning curve for the first 3-4 hours. You will find yourself being dominated by your opposition most of the time. Luckily, there is the Prologue campaign, the Bootcamp, and the VR Training missions that do a great job at explaining the changes and improvements since ArmA 2.  The story of ArmA 3 will put you in the boots of Corporal Kerry, a United States soldier who is apart of a joint NATO peacekeeping force in the Republic of Altis. The 3 playable in game forces are the same with any ArmA game, BLUFOR (NATO &amp; FIA), OPFOR (CSAT), and the Independent AAF, each with their own exclusive weapons and vehicles.  No matter which side you fight for, if you find yourself commanding a large army, you cant just send them all at the objective at once and pray to god that it works. No, you must use REAL tactics and have a good strategy, utilizing your supports and making every asset count.  If you want a game where twitch reflexes do not instantly win the game, this is a good game to check out. However, if you do not have a good system and are cash strapped, I advise you wait for a sale to come out, you can usually pick up the game and ALL of its DLC at a discounted price during that time.",

Too often is early-access a disaster with most companies. So it was good to see this game be a refreshing change to that trend.  Arma 3 as of pre-DLC was excellent. Runs much better on less up-to-date hardware than its predecessor. Has a wide range of settings with a built-in FPS gauge in the settings menu that really comes in handy. Other notable gains over its predecessor are a host of innovative gameplay mechanics, along with the usual suspects of arma styled gameplay.  I have recently been playing a boatload of King of the hill on some of the larger servers, and i have to admit the ability of the engine to do what it does is flawless. However it is ruined.  How is it ruined you ask? Simple. Bohemia has transmogrified into a money-grubbing DLC-pushing ♥♥♥♥♥ of a AAA wannabe. Its so cool to get into a really intense battle, run out of ammo, look to a fallen comrade for a replacement weapon only to be greeted with a 'pay us money, this is a 'premium' weapon' message. Im pretty sure i payed for a full game, not some cheap mmo.   Obviously the way that Operation Arrowhead was passively incorporated into arma 2 just wasn't earning them the money they wanted. So all that there is to do is tell people to stay away unless you plan on paying at least 75$ for the entirety of this game. It's really sad to see it go down like this. I had high hopes for BI as a company, but i can't say i'll be making a third purchase from them.",

You can fly a heli , drive a car ,ride a quadbike (quadbike fav vehicle) everything in the shop is pretty cheap but some other things are a little bit expensive...It runs quite well but WHY NO SINGAPORE SERVERS?!?!?!?! BTW Choose independant if you wanna play a THAI server becuz they mic spam in side chat in BLUFOR and OPFOR... Independant is more fun then BLUFOR and OPFOR becuz its challenging! They upgraded the repairing things from arma 2 instead of having to get the parts and ♥♥♥♥ you just need a repairing kit (Arma 2 DayZ Mod) MOVING ON TO THE BAD STUFF  BADSTUFF  ♥♥♥♥♥ everywhere People mic spam in my server NOT EVEN TALKING ENGLISH in side channel Only few people are nice to become friends Get killed on sight even without weapons its ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.I spawn and instantly die Doesn't have a safe zone for any teams.

This game barely even touches the graphics card which in my opinion is very ♥♥♥ backwards considering how advanced gpus are. The game would be fun if it would run, hopefully multicore support is a thing in a later date. I suggest and i5 or i7 processor if you are ever going to get frames online with this piece of junk. THe game is fun though just the multiplayer servers have a trend of playing really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game modes such as stratis life and any form of wasteland. In my opinion the game should be more structured and focused on team based combat rather than every man for themselves on 200km squared (or however large the map is).

EDIT: After hundreds of hours spent on this game it's extremely obvious it's just broken.  Optimization is nearly non-existent. With more than 40 players every server lags so much that it takes an entire magazine + 5 seconds of lag to kill someone. Countless glitches persist to exist since the release of Operation Flashpoint (First Arma game.) If not the glitches, then hackers and scripters will certainly break your day. And if not purposefully malicious hackers, then purposefully malicious players will do everything in their power to annoy you. And Bohemia Interactive have armed them with an incredibly powerful arsenal. The game itself is very over-priced. 25$ is the most I would (And did) pay for it. And they dare demand even more money for crappy DLC's that add nothing to the game, but break it's balance even more. You really need to work your ♥♥♥ off to painfully extract any enjoyment out of this game, unless you are an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and take joy in annoying others.  I only recommend this game if you are a military simulator nut and intend to play only in closed, community-organized events on a heavily modded game.",

In this abstract indie art game, you ask yourself these philosophical questions while dealing with the terrorizing dead circle of reloading the same mediterrenian island art installation over and over.  10/10 - Perfect for independent strong womyn that can afford huge monitors and enough meth to get the cognitive abilities to hit anything at all.

Arma II, without any DLC, has such a great amount of content, it surpases Arma III, and then, with the addition of DLCs such as Operation Arrowhead, Czech Republic, etc.    My question is, is there more to come for Arma III?

To Run this game at a pretty stable FPS on multiplayer (Since its whats most people plan on playing) You need a Decent PC, It is not targeted towards Low-end rigs but way more so to the mid-high-end rigs.  The game has ALOT of bugs from vehicles flipping out to dieing by running down stairs and glitching through a wall , Jumping 2 feet from a ledge and dieing but not from the ROOF of the hospital in Kavala , They can be soul breaking and really dishearthening.  This might seem like a Negative Review but the reason why I give it a Thumbs up is not just because of the Graphics (especially all ultra maxed out) or that I am a big fan of Simulation related or types of game but its the ADRENALINE you get when in a fire fight, Yes you might play CS:GO and get a kill and feel *meh* about it but when you are in a proper full on 50v50 Firefight , Granades , Rockets , Smokes , LMG fire , MMG fire , HMG fire , small arms fire is comming at you in the front lines of the battle and you look back over your shoulder see'ing your squad Downed. It makes it your mission to go down swinging and the the immersion adding onto it with the fantastic surpression and sound affects adding to it all.  This game Is primarily Millitary Focused , However you can play more RPG style mod's like A3L as the modding community is huge for this game.  My favourite aspect about this Game is flying of course, I have spent about 1000+ hours in a chopper alone of the 1800 at the moment , this game and it for some reason just cant make me stop.  I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone interested in Simulation / Fire fighting / Adrenaline large scale combat thrilling people.  LePanda",

The difficulty is artificially inflated by AI that cannot correctly path or follow orders, but has accuracy based on a slider-style. This is not fun.   It's particularly annoying after spending hours within the keybinding section, trying desperately to get a system that works from a standard keyboard. I appreciate you're going for simulation but when you run out of keys and start having to use CTRL or ALT then your game is simply too complicated, and fumbling around the keyboard during a firefight for optics modes etc is just frustrating.   The graphics are pretty, but only when cranked up, and I had to do some config editing to get any reasonable framerate out of it. That said, even stripped down, the graphics are ok.   I appreciate that the hardcore fans that have put hours upon hours of training to get passable at this game will flame a review like this but this game is simply hard for hard's sake. I can take challenging. I can't take mission fail after mission fail because the team members failed to react accordingly to orders. ",

The best mods are King of the Hill, where 3 teams of 40 fight for control of a 1km wide circle using jets, tanks, armored vehicles, attack helicopters, snipers, aandan assortment of infantry, all uniquely equipped. The bullet trajectory physics is awesome, you can shoot through most walls depending on their make up. The learning curve is sharp, as there are a lot of buttons to know and rebind, but taking the time to learn them and set up a configuration that's right for you is worth it. The game is a lot more complicated than most shooters. After playing arma, going back to other shooters lime CS GO seem so gross, the idea of running around and shooting a fully automatic rifle (which by the way has only tracer rounds) and actually being accurate is ridiculous. Arma is the best shooter I have ever played, it offers a sandbox of tools and content for people to create their very own experience.",

            "review_text": "Let me start off by saying that this is my second review. I originally gave it great reviews but after seeing what's being released lately, I just can't merit the initial praise I gave this game. This game has a lot of potential. There really aren't many games like this, if any. People can cite whatever they want but nothing comes close to a game of this scale. The fidelity of the flight combat, compared to anything other than games like DCS, Falcon or CLoD is unparalleled. Operation Flashpoint just simply cannot compare to this game. Games like BF or COD or even Red Orchestra aren’t even in the vicinity of this game as far as realism is concerned. The only thing that compares is Project Reality on BF2 (more on that later). With all of the praise, this game just comes up flat. I’ve spent hours modifying cfg files in Arma 2 and Arma 3. I’ve been a fan of the series for a very long time. I’ve owned every single arma other than the original Operation Flashpoint. I’ve owned, Arma and All of the expansions, Arma 2, Arma 2: OA and now this. I will probably purchase Tanoa also, IF they work on making it a 64 bit application.  The decision to make this a 32 bit game was a colossal failure. The engine as it stands right now, cannot utilize ANY of your systems resources efficiently. It doesn’t utilize multi-core properly, it can’t use nearly enough of my RAM, and it cannot use more than 20% of either GPU, let alone run SLI properly. I get the same frames whether I use 3 screens or 1 screen.  The gameplay is the best there is for a shooter. There just isn’t anything that rivals this currently. The scale of the war that you can have in this simulator is unreal. You can have massive battles that can go on forever. There are countless mods that include; game modes, vehicle (air, land, sea, space), nuclear weapons, halo mods. Want to fly an F-16? Somebody probably has the mod. Want to fly a Mig? Somebody has it. Want to play Arma2 but you don’t own the game? Download “AllInArma.” The developers promote the community and love that the community mods this game.  The sound is phenomenal. It’s not some thrilling game like BF4 or COD as far as sounds are concerned. Initially they sound underwhelming. However, upon closer inspection they really do sound accurate. Also, the atmosphere of sounds when battle begins is unreal. You will twitch when bullets come close to you. You can hear them whizzing past and each sounds somewhat different. Vehicles sound unique, explosions sound insane. It’s amazing how an explosion from an aircraft yields no sound if you’re in it but if you’re on the ground it sounds enormous. You will shake violently as heavy rounds or ordinance land in your vicinity.  The graphics can go from looking photorealistic to looking like a slide-show; seriously. This can be the greatest game ever, if they just fix the engine. I know it’s not a mild undertaking, but I’m pretty confident they can afford to do so. If they fix the graphics engine, and that’s a big if, they will be able to draw from a much larger crowd. Which brings me to Project Reality. While Bohemia, who I have a lot of respect for, has been messing around with this outdated engine, The creators of Project Reality got a kickstarter for their new offering squad that runs in 64 bit, uses multicore and employs DX12. If Tanoa and the release of the new engine incorporates DX12 while taking advantage of multi-core, I think Arma3 will survive; if it isn’t well-optimized, you could see Squad draw from the BF COD crowd as well as the simulation/realism crowd. Just my 2 cents.  ",

I also had the pleasure of opting in for the ArmA 3 beta, allowing me to play it before it was released and I can say for one this game has grown so much since dev stage. The only issue I have is the lack of the 'last stand' stance that was removed at some point after beta, but only because I thought it was unique being able to shoot while lying on your back. But its really a trivial issue, the biggest issue you'll hear about is the lag issues during multiplayer which hopefully they'll be focusing on within the next year because it has been an issue since the previous games. But don't let that deter you from buying this amazing game. When you get it, it'll take some time to learn as this game has a steep learning curve but before long you'll get the hang of it and you'll be able to ignore the issues multiplayer has and you'll be speaking the lingo of the community while you're assaulting a large, heavily fortified enemy base. Theres hundreds of things you can do in this game and thats without the mods. As dumb as it sounds, one of my favorite things to do is play a sandbox mod (which you can easily find on the workshop here on Steam) and just fly around and explore the islands as theres hundreds of miles of detailed landscape to explore plus it helps me keep up my flying skills. Mods are another thing, there are thousands of them and each one brings something new to the table, the mod community is outstanding. Now... multiplayer lag issue aside, the other issue a lot of people have are the paid DLC that has been released; the helicopter dlc, marksmen dlc, etc. All these things probably should have been included into the vanilla game but after spending so much time in the game and realizing that it has hours upon hours of replayability then the extra $30 isn't that big of a deal. Its well worth the price of the game and DLC, especially with the upcoming Eden expansion which gives us a new tropical island to explore... things just get better and better with this game.

Long time Bi fan here, have been playing on the Virtual Battle Space since Operation Flashpoint demo included in a PC Gamer demo disk from early 2000's.  What you feel you're probably limited to in Arma3 today, you will not be limited to tomorrow. Bi has been working on this engine for a long time, and I doubt you'll see them put it down. They constantly update it, and are always looking for new types of game play elements to add.   The modding and content creating community are always hard at work, bringing sci-fi franchise cross overs or simply older cold war vehicle addons. A lot of the content that appeared in other ArmA games have made their way back into ArmA 3 threw either Bi releasing packs, or additional addon packs created by the community.   'Jankiness' of movement - It's constantly being tweaked, and reworked bit by bit. a new Stanima system that displays your characters stanima has been introduced and since tweaked to show/explain why your soldier keeps running out of breath (Turns out the more gear your carrying, the lower ammount of stanima you have is!). The ability to 'hang out' of vehicles and spray &amp; prey has been added, allowing even tank commanders to return close range fire from the hatch!  Helicopter &amp; Flight mechanics - Are still being worked out/on, but have generally been better simulated with the 'advanced aircraft controls' that have been added to the engine, allowing players to switch between 'realistic' and 'unrealistic' flight models from the game settings. Fast ropping and carry-all support that was seen in Bi's other product 'Take on Helicopters' has been introduced as well.   The Marksman DLC - Added to EVERYONE (not just DLC owners) the ability to support your gun on objects / deploy bipods for additional support on PRACTICALLY EVERY WORLD OBJECT / MOVABLE OBJECT (IE, You can use the hood of your car as a support for you rifle, increasing accuracy, then jump back in your car and keep driving, get out, repeat, etc!). This simple addition to the engine created the potential for a lot more 'shooters' in the environment, meaning you now don't need that one specific area of a hill to get the shots off you wanted.  The Eden Editor - A 3D world-view based editor to allow for more detailed and specific mission editing for the community- will be released (planned) some time around the end of February, but is aviable for everyone to play with now as a Beta threw the 'beta participation' option in steam. For years the community has wanted this, and now they've finally got a nice package to present to us!  I have a Bi Bias, and I've been using their products for a long time. I must say that the evolution of this engine, along with the contributing support of the community and progressive work being done on it, constantly working on, and adding new features to the game/engine- have made it a fantastic product to any Military or simulator buff- And to those individuals alone, it IS NOT a $60 mistake waiting to be purchased on the steam workshop.   Enjoy it today, enjoy it tomorrow. There will be a day you REALLY enjoy this game.",

Pros (these may include pros from Arma 2 aswell):  - MUCH better optimised than Arma 2, no idea what they have done but this runs much smoother than Arma 2.  - No more thermal sights, I tend to really only play KOTH and have yet to be killed by any thermal sight.  - Animations are much more realistic.  - Audio is much better, as of a recent update the sounds (especially distant gunfire) are higher quality.  - More to it, sounds bland I know but there are more things you can do, such as sit and shoot, set up bipod/lock prone position.  - As well as being better optimised the game itself is much prettier than Arma 2.  - Kills are very satisfying, especially when it comes down to a tactical kill.  - There is so many options for tactical play, like there is so much you can do in order to gain a tactical advantage.  Cons (these will include cons that are also present in Arma 2):  - Snipers, although they are a true threat in war, they are also 90% cause of death in this game.  - Control scheme changed, quite a bit actually enough so that you may have to shamefully ask how to do a certain action or be forever lost in Arma 3's key binding options.  - Lag and desync still exist, and will probably kill you at least once (I know all games can experience lag but Arma has a very unique form of desync that can make pilots/drivers crash and soldiers teleport).  - FPS drops/stutters, whilst rare they can and will happen at some point (I randomly got about 11FPS at one point, when I regularly get over 30-40FPS maybe more).  - Bugs, you see some traumatising s*** and I am not refering to the terrors of war, I am refering to the dead guy 50ft in the air that keeps teleporting above you.  - Third person, this game has the option to go third or first person and most beginners will go TP as the game can be clunky to begin with but as a true FP player it can be annoying when someone hides in cover and peeks out lightening fast and instantly mows me down, or when I have a guy suppressed and move to a new spot he waits until I move to strike.    Overall is a good game that will annoy and frustrate you, but will always tempt you back for more.",

            "review_text": " 1300 Hour UPDATE: 19 OCT 2016. Older and wiser, right?  This is quite possibly one of the best games I'll ever play. If you’re the military type—real mil., not COD / FPS / what have you—this is a must have. If you haven't played it, if your pc can run it, get it.  The campaign is alright and the multiplayer is worth endless hours of entertainment.   I can’t be bothered to write a full evaluation, as that would be pages long and I doubt anyone would read it. Instead, I’ll just list some points. Don’t base your purchase on my review alone.  If &lt;60 FPS is a problem for you, you may want to look elsewhere. This game will take your high end, relatively recent, gaming rig and make it look like a toy. The Arma 3 game engine is absolute garbage for optimization, and that won’t change within the lifetime of the game. However, when (if) the next iteration of the Arma series arrives, BIS has promised a new engine. Hopefully with better performance.  A second issue I have with the game is DLC. I don’t mind DLC, and I understand why it can be a good thing, but in the case of A3... Too pricy for what you’re getting. Sure, the DLC content is pretty fantastic, but it’s basically useless by itself. You still need player-made missions to utilize it, and in many cases a server and community to host it. 90% of the game’s official single and multiplayer content makes no use of the games DLC extras (excluding the Apex  ”campaign”  and content; that doesn’t really count).  It also sucks to have bought the digital deluxe version and not get anything useful such as some free DLC content or in-game recognition. Don't buy digital deluxe- if you want the map (fairly useless unless you want to get it printed as a poster), guide (the games FM feature is boss for new players, I’ll give it that), or in-game music (eww) you can find it online for free; it's nice to legally own it but not worth the money. As of right now, if you want all the DLC, get the Apex edition.   This game also relies a great deal on community content and modding, for most hardcore Arma players, the vanilla experience is somewhat lacking. I’d highly recommend checking out the Steam Workshop, the BI forums, and possibly Armaholic (though it’s getting dated). Once you’ve tried a few good addons you’ll wonder why BIS hasn’t added the stuff into the game already!  Don’t pay full price for this game; it’s not worth it. If you can get it for 25%, or better 50%+ off, go for it! Keep in mind, though, if you’re reading this review some years in the future, this game will lose a ton of value when the next iteration comes, as the community will move on. It’s quite reliant on multiplayer and modding.  All that being said, with the drawbacks this game has—such as horrible performance universally, overpriced DLC, community reliance for content, future / space alien factions, hollow cookie cutter AI, et al— It’ll be something I look back on as a significant part of my life when I’m older.  I’d give it a solid 4/5. ",

But I personally think that the best part of the game is the community, with the inmense ammount of mods, I have 40 gb if not more of mods.  A lot of mods brings inmersion and realism, this and playing on a unit Its the best thing to experience on Arma 3.

That alone makes the game seem like less of a sim to me, and more of a Futuristic FPS with incredibly complex controls. The amount of content at the start was also quite lacking, deciding to use multiple varients of one rifle instead of making seperate platforms, making the game monotonous without mods to add in modern day weaponry.  That being said, if you can get past all of the glitches, poor optimization, obtuse control scheme, and incredibly fragmented comunity, this is by far one of the greatest games ever made. Arma 3 excels in one thing that is only equaled by Garry's Mod: Sandbox gameplay. This is less of a game and more of a set of tools to create and execute scenarios made by the community, whether it is a single player making small scenarios for themselves, or a team of creators making an expansive mission for their unit to play co-op with. This is bolstered by the excellent modding community, which is always active and looking to add more amazing content to this already great game. Arma 3 is what you make of it, so if you are into PVP or PVE, there is something in this game for you.",

The only problem is, they built it on an out dated and really bad engine. At times, I cannot help but ask myself why. Like why can't I move while switching weapons. Or why everytime I move it's just delayed. Even my relatively powerful computer can barely run this game with 30 frames when theres some action.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a fun game. I really enjoy it, but it's like Arma 2's engine with A LOT more content that it can barely handle, and it's pretty easy to tell.",

I was sceptic about Arma3, since it was pushed a lot via different magazines and channels. At first glimpse i seemed to be right, Arma 3 without singleplayer, wtf? BUT: i have to admit, that the two chapters of the campaign yet released brought it all back for me. The old fever came back in a rush, nailing me in my seat just to replay mission by mission over and over again (you know, just to not lose a single member of my team...). Gameplay is smooth, i never came across (or failed to recognize) a single bug, graphics are awesome, weapon handling is unmatched ... i could carry on like that for while.

Ragdoll physics have been implemented, and the look spectacular, as well as the new vehicle mechanics. Improved AI makes the enmy more fun yet more deadly, both friendly and enemy. The campaign is much better than that of previous Arma titles (my own personal opinion). It is longer and more in depth, and has several unique twists. Also, user made scenarios can be downloaded through the Steam workshop. I don't play with any mods, so I really won't pretend to.  Even if you have never played Arma a day in your life, i would recommend this game for the lengthy campaign, amazing graphics and gameplay, downloadable user scenarios, and spectacular multiplayer, not to mention mods.

Listening carefully you can hear the full range of sounds a weapon makes when fired, the bullet explosion along with the self reloading mechanism and the release of the shell casing - unlike other games that concentrate on the explosion sound itself. I would, however, like to hear more realism in the movement across different surfaces, while footsteps sounds are good, I would like to hear the sounds of the different grasses and bushes scraping past your uniform.

So why am I paying for a game that wont be finished until modders have plugged their hard work into free fixes? Why not just get a modding community to make the better Arma? Since they do it outside of the company ANYWAY?   The thing is, many, many loyal community members pleaded with BIS to remove the issues Arma 2 had, with Arma 3. But they didn't.

Arma3 compromise not a lot, focusing on what is important. Game has steep learning curve, and you need mouse with plenty of buttons - and uber keyboard skills to tackle this game. Reward is amaizing tactical gameplay you get online.  (and with a bit of skill you can map ps3 controller to cover most vechicle functions and basic movements for that crucial moments)  PROS Annimations has been improved a lot! Game models looks great in detail Awesome mod support and workshop integration Hours of fun on large map Mostly good online community of players. Steep learning curve filters out COD style kids.  CONS Maps feel empty and 'too clean' sometimes. Lack of grittyness  Still no secondary weapon in holster - Cmon I can forgive no SP campain on release date.. but not fixing simple bug like that on time? Poor SLI performance (10% improvement - or is it just me?) Lack of decent tutorial  Overall Arma3 is great fun, even more if you have few people to play with, as VOIP is must. There is few things that should be ironed out and polished before game should have 'released' status in my opinion as beta was really ok, to keep works in progress and release final product with all fixes applied. But I would recommen this title for more advanced military shooter lovers. Expect to run.... a lot!  Overall  8/10",

My biggest question is, what the hell am I supposed to be doing exactly? Perhaps too realistic for my living room.   So, clearly a work in progress. I suggest looking up gameplay videos before you purchase, because this is a WYSIWYG purchase. The ♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that the controls are sophisticated as hell. In fact, the controls are so different compared to most games that I play of a similar genre that I decided it wasn't worth my time to learn them. This isn't your typical bang bang, boom boom, shoot em' up Johnny, fifteen minutes before prior arrangements kind of game, it requires patience! In order to enjoy this game, you'll need to sit down, free up the next week and a half and really familiarize yourself with the controls, features available, etc.  The good is that I can tell already that this game is flexible and detailed, allowing for user created mods. If you enjoyed Ghost Recon or Flight Simulator, you may like this.   I would not recommend this game because I don't think that $60 is a fair asking price for what I recieve in return. Seeing as it is still under active development, I'm actually quite suprised that they would ask that much for it. Then again, I'm probably just butt hurt that I wasted a chunk of my paycheck on a game that was clearly outside of my comfort zone.",

Robotic animations, unrealistic physics and flight models, hollow low-production value sound effects, bland visuals unless you have an absolute beast of a computer, horrible UI, clunky controls, the list goes on, and on, and on. It makes no sense to someone who wanted to see so much from ARMA III, that almost nothing has chanegd from the previous games. It seems instead of addressing these immersion breaking features, the dev team focused mainly on an absolutly massive island, which they succeeded in producing. Unfortunatly, the gameplay on this island is much less than enjoyable with the host of problems detailed above and all the other various performance problems and bugs. The editor has been somewhat improved. Campaign is about as broken as its ever been, which I guess is to be expected, and other scenerios just feel rediculous with armored vehicles hitting rocks at 160km/hr and flying 50 feet in the air, their obnoxious guns rattling away their tune. Anyone who truly expects anything from a dev in a sequel should be hugly disapointed with this broken pile of rubbish selling for $60.",

Even on the lowest difficulty setting, the enemy AI will be downright stupid in the manner that they approach you, but once they're in position and they know where you are... You're as good as dead unless you rethink your approach. On the flipside, the campaign is entertaining when you get lucky and are surprised to see things go your way for once, but it's usually by the skin of your teeth. Most reasons people would buy this game is for the multiplayer and other mods made for it, but the campaign mode should only serve as a crash and burn tutorial. If you despise frusturation but love when a plan comes together, this game is for you. It's important to note that this is more a simulator than a game, where you can create your own missions/scenarios, be it online or single player.  P.S. There are no realistic ballistic characteristics among the ammo calibers in this game. Unless you score headshots all the time, every rifle/pistol does about the same damage to enemy AI. It could take anywhere from 3-5 landed shots to take someone down. Your best bet everytime is choosing a low recoil weapon where you're able to re-acquire your sight picture quickly after every shot. Or, any scoped rifle. So, any SMG on burst fire or accurate sniper rifles are your best friends around here.",

            "review_text": "Rating: 9/10  Brief Summary: ArmA 3 is an open-world military simulator. It is a first/third person shooter with drivable vehicles, but is considerably more realistic than games like CoD or Battlefield. For example, the firearms handling is probably the most realistic thing you'll see in any modern game. Projectiles behave like they do in real life; they travel in ballistic arcs, lose velocity as they travel through the air, and drift due to wind. Due to the sheer scale of the maps (270 km2 for the Altis map), and the realistic weapon handling, combat feels very different from your average shooter. Infantry usually engage from hundreds of meters away; tanks and helicopters may engage targets that are several kilometers away. Cover, concealment, and smart tactical positioning are the way to survive and win in ArmA 3, and there's much less of the close-range machinegun blasting that makes up a lot of the gameplay in other FPSs. The inventory system is a major improvement over previous Arma games. You now have weight based system, and you can pick up a backpack and load that up with gear as well. Weapon modding can now be done on the battlefield, allowing you to switch scopes, add/remove flashlights and lasers, and attach/detach silencers in the middle of battle.   Content: You can either play a single-player campaign, individual single player missions, or play multiplayer. The game also features a fully-functioning editor that allows the creation of missions, and also can be used to free roam the maps. The game in its current state contains two maps, the 270km2 Altis map and the 20km2 Stratis map. These maps are fully accessible, highly detailed, and have a hand-crafted high quality feel. They are both land and water maps; anyone with SCUBA gear or a submarine can dive to the bottom of the ocean, which is detailed as well. The game currently comes with three major factions, plus rebel and civilian factions. Each of the two major factions have a decent working set of infantrymen, firearms, tanks, artillery and assorted armored vehicles, though aerial vehicles are currently limited to helicopters. There is a third faction which is currently being filled out by free DLC from the developers.  PROs: Huge game maps, open world gameplay, and a unique videogame combat experience. The developers have historically been friendly to modders, and ArmA 3 is now integrated with Steam Workshop so that you can download user-created missions straight from the Workshop.  CONs: Buggy, engine is somewhat antiquated and not well optimized. Single player campaign is currently unfinished (1/3 is currently released), but is being updated with free DLC packs.",

I find this rather disapointing, as there is no lack of jets in ARMA2, and all of it's addons. I just think some more jets should be added, that do not require the download of mods.

The most enjoyable gameplay ive found is online in a Coop map with 50-60 other players fighting against AI with everything we have. This is not for people who like CoD and BF's fast action paced shooting, generally the enemy base is halfway across the map (Altis) from your base thus even flying with a helicopter at the speed of 200+ kmh it takes 5-10 minutes to even reach the place, count in the fact that sometimes you have to wait for the pilots to return for another run.  Also being very moddable game, various game modes such as DayZ, Wasteland (dayz but no zombies pretty much) and Arma RPG life are very popular among people who dont wish to shoot much but adventure instead. Not only mods but you can actually create your own mission/scenario/race with the ingame tools!

I can attempt to play with all the video settings on low (disabled) or Ultra and never obtain over 30fps inside a city (just strolling down the streets, no fighting, explosions ect.)

There is even a slot for mags so you can manually reload used mags and drain them out! But better than everything is that you can't pinpoint what makes Arma 3 feel so diffrent from Arma 2, because of all of what they did. In fact, people that disliked Arma 2 then came on to buy Arma 3 because it's THAT diffrent! It's worth the 60$, but you should just wait for a Steam Summer/Winter Sale to get huge discounts. Plus, Arma 3 is also more customizable with coding/map making, just look at some of the existing Arma 3 videos and all of the sweet gametypes that AREN'T on Arma 2. One of the biggest things they did (besides make better vehicle physics) was add a legitamate campaign instead of just missions with little or no story. But even better than actually working vehicle physics, is how freakin' optimized the new engine is, and yet is simultaniously so powerful! Need I say more with that final thought?",

Although i still do like the COD series, i have not played one scince Black Ops 2, Anyways back to this ARMA, It has many different game modes from Altis Life- CO-OP Missons, Altis life is set up like an RPG, Which is fun but not really my type of game play, it is the reason that i got the game but i enjoy the CO-OP missions more, Once again i strongly suggest this game to anyone. Hopefully they stay on track with the realisim and make an ARMA 4!!!!!",

            "review_text": "The game itself is unlike the easy predecessor Arma 2. When you get shot your guy reacts to it and makes assaulting almost impossible. Not only that but when you run your guy will become fatigued and start to slow down, this makes traveling long distances a little more realistic. Weight plays a great factor in the game, the more weight the less stamina making you a nice slow easy target. The hoarding days are over, carrying and unrealistic amount of weight and being able to cross the map on foot will be a challenge. The best route for combat is to take cover and move up slowly, most players will find this as a disadvantage due to time consumption. Take gun recoil into your thoughts as you choose what weapon to use, sometimes a smaller caliber rifle will out match the light machine gun due to weapon recoil. Stances can be your best way to get a better look at an area. Because Arma 3 uses bullet penetration, a wall does not mean safety. Some structures primarily wood ones can be shot through making peaking through a window and ducking when being shot at not that safe anymore. Also take in mind your ammunition, when you reload the magazine is put in your inventory and replaced with another magazine. Unlike previous Arma 2 games when you move onto another mission during campaign you carry the exact same items as you did before. Meaning if you left one bullet in your magazine and reloaded, you still have a magazine on you with one bullet. Using all of the rounds in a clip is advised to save needed space. There are vest and rigs that you can scavenge from dead enemies, these usually have items inside them when you pick them up so remember to check your rig or vest often. Attachments are a very nice part of the game, being able to pick up a enemy weapon strip it of its attachments pick your gun back up and attach the attachments to your gun can make all the difference. Choosing between one more magazine and one more grenade can be a challenge test out grenades and see how accrete you are with them; remember that a grenade has to be thrown unless it is a grenade for a grenade launcher. This limits the area that you can throw it too; take in mind that the trees and bushes will stop a grenade from continuing on its mission. Vehicles are nice but not as hardened as Arma 2 vehicles, Ramming down fences and running sown signs are now more consequential. Take in mind that during the campaign a great portion is on foot, but vehicles do have their part in the campaign. Searching the inventory of a vehicle that you cannot drive can be very productive; some vehicles have a abundance of items that can help you. A note, that in your controls in presets there is an option called Arma 2, if you are coming from Arma 2 this would be a nice option for you but if you are not familiar with Arma 2 controls you can try to learn the default controls. Unlike Arma 2 when night time comes you better have night vision goggles if not there is no upping the gamma till you can see, (as of currently) the gamma might be changeable in the main menu. Take in the environment and learn the terrain because you are in for one heck of a ride my friends, welcome to Arma 3.",

Cons: - Very poorly optomised (hard on CPU) - Will sometimes crash online  All in all, I enjoy this game, and recommend it when its on sale.",

It's your choise whether you believe or not. If I was cheating I wouldn't be writing this review and also I wouldn't be cheating after 100h of play time.  So let me start here with what happened and then I write review.  I used to play this game a lot and then I only played this occasionally with friends on servers. Last time I played this game was when helicopters were realesed so I bought them and played a lot with friends. So very last time I played was maybe 5 months ago.  1 week ago I was invited to join lots of friends. So I turned game and got message GLOBAL BAN from BATTLE EYE. No message or reason why or what for just GLOBAL BAN meaning I couldn't join any server. Dind't know what to do so I did research on battle eye and if you do research yourself it means if you get global ban you are f*cked and battle eye don't give a f*ck, because :  THEY WILL NOT PROVIDE WITH MESSAGE WHY YOU WERE BANNED AND THEY WON'T UNBAN YOU meaning and if you were banned it was for a reason!  I didn't cheat so I don't know reason. Anyway I sent them mail (to battle eye) I have recieved automated response from tem seconds after saying : EXACT WORDS:  IMPORTANT: Note that all global bans issued by us are valid by default. While we carefully investigate every case, please understand that we will not manually re-confirm the validity of your ban to you. Therefore, if we don't get back to you within the next 72 hours you can assume that your global ban is valid and will not be lifted by us. Sending the same request multiple times will not accelerate our reviewing process in any way. Also, note that we will not disclose any details (including internal evidence) about your ban.  Basically saying we don't give a f*ck about you and you f*cked and go f*ck yourself, simple.  basically it's 3 days. It's been 1 week no response as I expected.  So I spent lots of money on this game just to get banned for LIFE even I didn't cheat and no one gives a f*ck.  I bought this game to play multiplayer not single player mission.  ----------------------------------------------------------------  So now move on to game itself.  Game is too expensive and is getting old, single player mission are only single player not coop and they are very long and diffcult as f*ck even on easy settings.  DLCs are total rip off. they said you can lift almost anything with helicopters. BIG BULLS*HIT because there are only 3 or 4 things you can lift. You can't lift lorries as they said you could.  BIG BIG LAYERS JUST TO HARD SELL.  Multiplayer: Too many servers which are unstable getting hacked or restrarting every 5 f*cking minutes.  So whats good about this game?  Nothing. If you want this game to play single player mision download it for free.  If you want it to play as multiplayer than expect s*ity servers and getting ban for no reason whatsoever and once you get banned expect as above no one will give a f*ck.  Arma 3 / bohemia eagle will say they have nothing to do with it if you get reply from poor customer service and battle eye won't even bother to reply.  Once you get banned you basically have single player s*ity game.  Would I recommend it?  DEFINETELY NO. I wish I could get my moeny back but off course, if no one gives a f*ck and no one replies to you so screwed.  This is the best customer service, you get banned for no reason/ mistake and no one will ever tell you why and what for.  So there you go.  Like I said at the start I didn't cheat, I have no need to cheat, it is your choise whether you believe it or not. SO you just have to trust me I guess and read this long story, because basically I lost all money I paid for game + DLCs what are total rip off ",

Well, the good news is that in Arma 3, you can do all of that and more.  This game was designed to be a sandbox military simulator, and it is just that. The beauty of it, is that it's not locked to either small-scale fast-paced run and gun or massive scale 24-hour battles. It can be both those things, and everything in between due to fantastic modding and custom map-creation tools that every player has access to. I haven't taken much of a look at the campaign, but to be honest, the Arma series was never really created for its campaign. Multiplayer is excellent, graphics are excellent. What else is there to say? Just make sure you have a beast of a PC if you want to run it on ultra-high settings.",

            "review_text": "This game is so awesome, IMHO bohemia has outdone themselves. I have played a good deal of arma 2 and it was sweet. But this game takes all (hence my already 115 hours in it). BECTI is one of the best gamemodes I've ever played worth the price of admission just for that. Im really enjoying the SP campaign as well, has its glitches and bugs but thats just arma.   The modability of this platform is really the reason to get this or any other BI game. I realize some people think that it is lazinees on the developers part to rely on modders to make their game great, but to me the whole engine is just a modding platform and BI has been nice enough to not only give us a peek under the hood, they let modders rip it apart and put it back together. Very rare in this day and age.   Spoiler for long part on optimization   Now to the real question...optimization and how does it run, my specs are 8350 under water light oc 4.3 ghz, R9 290 also underwater, and 8gb of 1600 ram. Well I will say it runs a whole crapton better than arma 2 on my computer, my experience is mostly limited to dayz in arma 3, but I played a bit of breaking point and if I get on a good server I get a good steady 50-60 fps outside of cities and mostly maintain 30-40 fps in cities until a lot of action with dips to 25ish. In arma 2 I couldnt even manage 30-40 on the best of days. So its a much more enjoyable experience. Now obviously if you go intel you will have better overall fps, my brother has a 4670k and 290 and gets an average of 0-15 better fps than I do (may not sound like a lot but when hes getting 40 when I get 25 it sure does). I got my 8350 for free so I took it, it works a charm in almost every other game except this one. Considering for some wierd reason 25 fps is playable in this game (its really strange, I consider 45-50 to be minimum in other games) ill keep it. You will ahve to work a bit to make sure you have good ping to a server, and if you have bad fps try another server, you'll be surprised how much a good server helps, when playing SP becti or whole lotta altis I sit at around 38-45 once the ai get going. When me and my brother play he hosts and I can get 50-60 for the most part with dips still into the mid-high 20s. So yea find a good server and it will make a world of difference!     The features in this game honestly amaze me (BI takes the cake when it comes to ingenuity), sling loading is awesome, and not only can you shoot from vehicles but Helos with ramps you can open the ramp and shoot from it, so sweet. The advanced flight model while challenging to learn is a lotta of fun once you do. The marksman dlc is looking like it will be sweet, deployable bipods ought to be a real treat (even if they should've been in the game by now better late than never!)  Spoiler for dlc (I didnt realize these spoilers didnt colapse, but it helps to break up the wall of text)    Speaking of dlc, there is a lot of negative talk about it, Which I dont quite get. Bohemia makes a dlc offers every engine feature free, and asks money for a few helos. The fact that they dont want to split the MP playerbase is really a great step in the right direction IHMO. If you dont want the dlc just dont buy it and voila nothing happens you dont get kicked off of servers that use it. You still get the best parts of the dlc for free (which were definitely the most work to implement on BI's part Im sure)  Ill pick on one of the worst but most popular now: EA and BF4. I played that game so much and I enjoyed it my overall K/D spread is positve, and I could manage to get MVP most if not all games, so yea I enjoyed it. but I also hated it, there were so many issues and here is ea still ram dlc down our throats along with battlepacks and class shortcuts. Im no sheep so I refuse to buy the dlc, I wont support such a money grubbing company at all. But now because every server (that has any population of which there are few enough anyway) has mostly DLC maps, I cant even play talk about not only splitting up the mp player base, but kicking out players who dont want to buy the dlc.   In the oposite direction, I was riding along with a guy in his taru the other day couldnt fly it but thats ok. People who think that the helos give an unfair advantage need to think again the damn things arent even armed.     Over all this is one of the greatest games I have played, the visuals are stunning. If you can get over some of the annoyances that are arma (ie movemoent is a bit wonky, no jumping execpt with mods, dieing from falling like 10 ft and more!) this game shines. I mean theirs what? Like 30 firing postitions? The attention to detail is pretty great. With the main map (altis at 270 sq/km) never has combined ops met such a huge battlefield.",

            "review_text": "The majority of the time spent on this game is online. However, it is almost impossible to come accross good servers with good players these days (Asia/Oceania/Europe). Servers are generally running non-vanilla gamemodes. While this can be charming for others (and apparently it is), it is very irritating to me as it eliminates the seriousness during the gameplay. ArmA 3 was meant to be the most realistic, strategic battle simulation game on the market. Therefore, user expectations are usually high and how much of these expactations are met is a very controversial topic. When you play ArmA 3 with a good bunch of game-buddies this is the best game ever, but you will find the most idiotic insufficiencies even though it has been more than 2 years FYI !  CONS : -No secondary arms visible on holster (WTF?) -Explosions are quiet childish and unrealistic -You can't jump without mods -Death animations are funny -Gore is minimized as possible -Woundings are boringly simple -Most important objects are not modelled for the animations. For example, healing animation is basically self-injecting a syringe of adrenalin to the leg. Ermm.. There is no syringe. Have I mentioned the animation for healing other players ? Well, no need because it is also self-injection animation. Another example, reloading the rocket launchers. There is no rockets. How about that ? -Musics. -Everyone plays individually in multiplayer. There is no teaming up, this is mostly due to language barriers. But these can be and should be solved with visuals.  PROS: -Graphics. -The world. It is practically real. I have personally went to one of the maps (islands) that actually exists. Nature and environment is very very real. -Physics, sounds, dynamics, realism, weapons. Thumbs up. -Openness to development -Customizations -My high hopes and never-ending expectations",

It is much more than a fps game, it takes tactics, restraint, communication, being careful, and being calm. It has a hard learning curve to become an effective soldier, but thats the best part. There is bootcamp to learn the basics and campaign to learn tactics and how to shoot. I find even if I do not take a single shot, I still meet nice people and have a great time. Do not feel overwhelmed by the combat. There is a bunch of servers that are not veteran combat simulators like Altis Life and Epoch.   My first experience in an regular invade and annex server does not seem amazing. I met up with my squad and boarded a helicopter. The heli was shot down by enemy aa in a matter of seconds. next we took a jeep for some reason which was shot by a tank and blew up. We then were shot off quad bikes. Then crashed another heli. Finally we reached the combat area. Then we were hacked. Our heads were replaced with street cones or burlap bags. Then the hacker shut down the server. This did no matter because I was with the funniest and nicest people. We made jokes and laughed. It was just a great time.  I have made countless other memories like getting a colleteral with a sniper rifle, shooting 20 people in the matter of 5 minutes, and huddling in a 10mx10m chapel with 20 men hiding from an attack helicopter. Although people say Arma is boring and uneventful, if you have a decent amount of patcience, you will be rewarded with a great playing experience.",

Make use of your stances and peek around cover, make sure you dial in your sights to the right range and if that 50 cal starts turning on your position you better run.    Getting tired of being in the sh!t? Download some modded missions like wasteland or exile and start surviving! Watch out for bandits that will kill you for that canned catfood hiding in the desolate hills of a devastated world.    More of a sandbox make your own mission kinda player? Well go to the editor and spawn whatever you like on the map, hop in to preview and play with it, then save it and upload it to the community. Or you could just download one of the thousands others have already made.   This is an amazing sandbox shooter, with vehicle, bullet velocity, and damage realism. Definitely not run and gun and you won't run through a room shooting and knifing 5+ players here.    However every game has it's cons. There's a couple of bugs to watch out for that have been in the game since day 1, and don't seem to ever be getting fixed. Here are the big ones.  -You can break your legs on small falls, such as off the side of stairs more than a few feet high but its easy to avoid once you know. -Players can peek through walls (some anti-cheat fixes this) -Sometimes you get stuck floating on second floors, but all you have to do is prone or vault   So if you're thinking of getting a new military shooter, and you're tired of the BF4 or COD feeling, you should definitely give Arma 3 a shot.",

It's a game which isn't designed for CoD fans or CS GO fans, and to be honest such games never interested me. Everyone who is serious about gaming and likes FPS games will find a mod that fit his style. Want GTA V mod? You got it, ALTIS LIFE, want DayZ mod? You got it, got Epoch or Breaking Point, want CS GO mod? You got it, got King of the Hill and Wasteland.  But the ultimate mod is Battle Royalle.",

Naturally you all run to cover but two more get hit before you can go prone, so you call out to the remaining squad members about how they are doing but you come under fire from the left flank killing everyone they took cover on the left side. So its just you and one friend left, against 5 possible contacts and a sniper. Seems like impossable odds? Well you are in the middle of a town and the cover you went into is a house in which your partner is in the other house so what you do is use hit and run tatics slowly killing them off until you get lucky and wipe off the flanking squad. Now all thats left is the sniper in which you know where he is because you saw his muzzle flash on his first shot. So you and your partner slowly move towards his position out side of town and you take aim, the first shot misses. Now he is alerted to your position and fires a single shot before you could kill him. He misses you, but hits your friend. Arma is a game where a single mistake, a mistake that can change you from the hunter to the prey. It could be even as small as forgetting to bring extra ammo to as major as not following a patrol pattern. Situational awarness is probally the best skill you can have in arma, of course being able to hit things is as well. The only reason why this game is still 40 bucks is not because of the dlc's and the vanilla content (Don't get me wrong i've spent 90 hours on vanilla but thats about it) but mainly because of the amazing modding community.",

Honestly, I feel a bit ripped off by the lack of content provided by the developers, and the gameplay seems aimed at entertaining the Call of Duty/Battlefield FPS crowd. They continue to update it with new content, but it just doesn't hold my interest very long. Not to mention the many unrealistic features they added in to make it combat seem more 'fluid and fast'  If you are overflowing with $$$, and you feel like buying it, go ahead. I would not recommend buying it just yet.  **UPDATE**  I am very pleased with the addition of new content. The sad part is the content is in the form of paid DLC, but they are worth buying on a sale.  The gameplay has changed heavily since I wrote the last review, and I can say that I do enjoy it, even though it is frustrating at times. I learned that the game will act as a realistic combat simulator if you treat it like one, and it will be a fast-paced FPS experience if you play it the wrong way.  Overall, I think it does a good job at keeping both of the genres entertained, but I will still hold Arma 2 close to my heart and soul. Try this game out, it really is fun. Just make sure you have some friends to play it with, it can get kind of boring.",

On singleplayer this game runs at 60-90fps depending on the scenerio played and on multiplayer it runs at 20-30fps even on a server with 120 players. You can play either fun gamemodes like king of the hill or extremely serious realism gamemodes with milsim units.

The Team AI, they are Dumber and slower then a bag of Bricks. They can be helpful in engaging the enemy IF you can actually make them follow you (they get stuck, they get lost, they shoot each other, they blow each other up, they block each other and so on). The enemy AI is too brutal, since they dont seem to see grass and can see through bushes and such (which you cant see through). The missions are designed to ♥♥♥♥ with you and trial by error will be a very common theme which is frustrating even to the most masochistic Players.  MP could be great but the People are Cancer. This game is the reason why i stopped playing MP games for a Long time and not planning to buy any other MP Only game. The Ammount of Toxicity i have experienced is insane. If you are a Psychopath/Sociopath you fit right in otherwise give this one a Pass, shame really. Unsure why a Milsim would attract this type of crowd.  Performance wise you need a very beefy Computer. CPU and GPU should be high end otherwise the game runs really poor.  DLC Huckstery is very strong in this game aswell, there are several weapons ingame you cant use without paying. They are arguably superior versions and this makes the game Pay2win. The DLC Apex seems seriously overpriced and because of my Poor MP and SP experience i wont buy it.  the Controls are Clunky and giving orders is a Tedious Nightmare.  The graphics however are very nice.  Finally i cannot reccommend the game, The game has been out for quite a while and SP wise its not going to change (4 free). MP is bound to become more toxic until the playerbase vanishes so i would avoid that too. The only saving grace could be if you have alot of dependable (and non psychotic) friends, the MP will certainly be awesome then.",

            "review_text": "For TL:DR, scroll to bottom for summary.  Arma 3 is a Military Simulator (milsim) which gives a focus on teamplay. Started as an Early Access title (one of the few Early Access titles that actually worked), gamers were able to submit feedback reports to the Arma 3 developers on a feedback website. This existed throughout Alpha and Beta phase until its full release. Because of this, the player base provided a lot of great feedback to the developer teams which ended up giving us a game much better than Arma 2. The player movement feels more fluid, the graphics are more clear, the world interactions and combat are better. Arma 3 is a little different in style from Arma 2, because it is more focused on a near-future war between NATO and CSAT (CSAT is a fictional Middle Eastern/Asian alliance).   Even after the game was launched, constant improvements have been made to the game, such as the introduction of the Marksmen update, which incorporated weapon bracing on world objects, the use of bipods on sniper weapons, vehicle-based turn-in/turn-out shooting (using a gun in a passenger vehicle) and the Helicopters update, which added a better physics model to helicopter flight and dynamics. These were released with DLC; but the actual mechanics were given to all players, which in itself: is generous of Bohemia to do so. Arma 3 just had a visuals update, which fixed the ugly water graphics glitch where water would animate above ocean level up terrain + other little changes here and there. With this aside, Arma 3 is a pretty solid game; but does have some steeper system requirements: thus may not work for everyone.  Arma 3 incorporates a coordinate system that real militaries use, squads, squad formations, identification of hostiles and movement is all a familiar thing to anyone who may have experienced time in the armed forces (I have not, but I know people who have and they were impressed). The game is not for your typical Call of duty or Rainbow Six or Battlefield type of player, the gunfights are much more challenging. In combat, you may have to zero in your sights to shoot down enemies from longer (or shorter) distances. The ballistics model in the game can be demonstrated clearly with the Virtual Arsenal/Virtual Training where the traces of each round can be viewed. Body armor matters in this game, as using lower-powered ammo will not cause as much damage (if none) to a target, thus forcing you to aim elsewhere or use a stronger gun. What is even cooler, is that if you shoot a enemy target far away with a lower-powered gun, the bullet velocity eventually slows down to the point where damage isn't as high as it would have been out the muzzle.   Vehicles have hitboxes; meaning that if a RPG strikes the side of an armored vehicle like an APC; the wheels/treads will likely take more damage than the vehicle's hull (unless a well-placed RPG shot gets in a weak spot). Grenades are useful, but not against armored targets (yes, frag grenades are almost completely useless against a 60 ton steel tank.) This encourages you to coordinate attacks on enemy targets, calling in airstrikes, specialists and other well-equipped units to deal with tougher hostiles, while your standard issue assault rifle will do just fine for infantry combat. The multiplayer in Arma 3 is the best, because you are around live players doing missions together which can be quite fun, even though there is a learning curve; it is well-rewarding when a mission succeeds and everyone makes it back alive. Arma has no shortage of tactical combat and planning. Keep in mind, this game isn't for everyone; simply because you don't usually join a server and have instant action all the time, it is more of a game of patience and finesse (or BLOW UP EVERYTHING if it is required).   In addition to the large maps and coordinated gameplay, this game has a rather good modding community with great mods coming out all the time. The game recently got a 3d mission editor which allows the use of a camera for much more precise object placement and better visualization. The game comprises of a nice scripting layer, which you can write your own custom scripts that can be executed in the game to present new operations. Modders have been able to make dynamic campaigns that are randomly generated and large scale. The modding capabilities are great, I have a USS Nimitz mod with an F-18, so I can do full carrier take-offs and landings, as well as in-flight refuel. Because I love to fly, a lot of my time is in the cockpit of a jet doing Combat Air Patrol (CAP) or Close Air Support (CAS) for ground units. Other times, I act as a transport pilot; but on many occassions I have done frontline ground assaults with a full squad armed with an SCAR CQB, RGO grenades and full body armor. This missions get hot sometimes, other times they are a walk in the park.   Arma 3 also has some diving units and missions; which are SEAL-level of awesome. You can board a small submarine and sneak up on the coast of an island, then walk inland and plant explosives on a enemy communications listening post. It is quite fun, and is even better when you do it at night. The AI in Arma 3 is much better than Arma 2, and the game has come a long way; I can vouch for that being a Early-Access Alpha and Beta contributor. Overall, if you are a fan of games which offer depth and a learning curve, Arma 3 is for you. The plus side of getting good at Arma 3, is you can turn your head back to those COD/BF/RS players and say: 'You got nothing on me.' If it isn't for that, it is just a great and enjoyable military simulator. If anyone has played Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis; this is basically a modern reincarnation of that.   Summary -   Pros: + Realistic warfare. + Challenging combat. + Team oriented gameplay. + Great modding support and community. + High replay value. + Land, Air and Sea combat. + Good assortment of weaponry, vehicles and units. + Easy and intuitive in-game editor. + Strictly a skill-based experience. + The IP owners legally authorize modders to port Arma 1 and 2 content. + Unit customization and a virtual arsenal for loadout editing and saving.   Mixed: = Some small DLC came out, but the developers did include the mechanics for free for non-DLC owners.  Cons: - Some areas are poorly optimized, thus presenting sometimes poor performance. - Not enough naval warfare. - FOV in some vehicles without optics can appear zoomed in.  I recommend.",

The campaign wasn't great but it was better then the arma 2 one. I found that multiplayer can be incredibly fun and entertaining but it can be really hard to find good servers, I would recommend the CCG servers or downloading a seperate launcher to find good servers. I think the game should really be played with friends and it can get a bit boring if playing alone all the time. Overall its a great game when you find good servers and have friends to play with and im really looking forward to the Apex DLC release as I think it will greatly improve the game. This game is definitely a good one to get if you are a fan of arma 2 or other games as such.",

Time to find a gun and survive. In this game mode it is alittle like hungergames, player slots vary, but i love to play on the ones with player slots from 64 people. Making it challenging but still possable. In the gamemode it is you fighting everyone last alive wins!  Altis Life   Roleplay your life, start a gang.

            "review_text": " SINGLEPLAYER-ONLY REVIEW. I haven’t touched multiplayer at all.    ArmA  is the type of game the GameSpots or IGNs of the world might give a 6 or 7 out of 10 because of big technical flaws, but offers something special that some might enjoy as much as a 9/10 game, kind of like Mirror’s Edge. Among military shooters it’s ambitious to the point of spectacularly falling on its face at some points and achieving equally spectacular feats at other points. It’s one of those games from which I wish other developers borrowed some ideas and gave them more polish, but I keep playing this one because no one else is making anything quite like it.  I’m mainly writing this review for anyone who hasn’t been exposed to Bohemia Interactive’s previous military simulators in the  ArmA  and  Operation Flashpoint  series, and a lot of what I’m about to write really applies to all these games.    ArmA  is the kind of game where missions simply give players objectives but no linear paths to completing them, usually commanding an AI squad. If you’re under an AI commander or squad leader, it’ll feed you dynamic objectives based on its own objectives and in reaction to what’s actually happening. For many this might be a first clue towards how ambitious and unscripted the AI in  ArmA  is. Another is how characters dynamically call out actual enemy positions in a sort of robot voice, indicating distance and direction. You can reload a combat encounter 20 times and get 20 different battles.  These battles can rage across miles in an open world that easily dwarfs games like  Skyrim  and is probably far larger than  Grand Theft Auto V . In includes forests that look as big as actual forests, and dozens of towns where you can open every door in every building. It’s not a matter of content, it’s this big to create a proper stage for combined-arms combat simultaneously incorporating full-scale infantry, tank, and air battles.  That scale makes  ArmA  feel nothing like conventional shooters in terms of pace or tactics. It isn’t a game about constant combat, it’s a game where you might spend 15 minutes driving or marching your squad across peaceful landscapes until a bullet suddenly whizzes past your head and instantly transforms the scene. I personally think it makes for a good sense of contrast. You’ll also rarely fight enemies less than 150 meters away.  If you’re like me and are mainly in it for the singleplayer experience, let me tell you I got much more out of modded content than Bohemia’s actual campaign. It’s not terrible but it also rarely makes use of the game’s core strengths. The campaign is split into three parts. In the first you’re a grunt following orders in what feel like slightly more dynamic Call of Duty battles. The middle act is the campaign at its best. In it you lead a small AI squad in guerrilla attacks and are given much more legroom in how you handle objectives. In-between missions this act let’s you traverse Altis and complete side objectives, which can end up being really cool demonstrations of  ArmA's  elements. Going on a quiet road trip under the night sky to ultimately plan your own assault in a pitch black forest or an urban mission in the city lights just isn’t something you can get anywhere else right now. The final third of the campaign has you leading larger groups into larger battles, but not with the same degree of freedom.  ArmA 3's  final mission, depending on story choices, is a neat and challenging take on open-world survival gameplay.  The uneven campaign is ultimately forgotten in the face of the mountains of fan-made mission and even campaigns. Many of them understand and play to the appeal of  ArmA's  dynamic open-world action. Some do this on a smaller scale using chunks of the world map (or custom maps), while others try to create grand adventures across the whole thing where almost all decisions are up to the player. There is easily enough good fan content for  ArmA 3  now to eclipse most typical shooter campaigns from a content standpoint. That doesn’t even mention the custom maps, units, weapons, and vehicles modders constantly churn out. The editor itself is fairly easy to grasp considering how obtuse the actual game can be. I’ve often had fun simply planting a jeep or helicopter in a map and using that to explore it, or setting up my own battles between AI characters.  That brings me to the first possible sticking point for those who try to step into Bohemia games. While it’s progressed over the years,  ArmA  has an interface that feels like it was designed around 90’s PC gaming principles from before console developers started to streamline things. The default control scheme uses basically the whole keyboard (and is designed to accommodate the lack of a mouse). The squad command interface relies completely on the function and number keys without using any mouse interface except the scroll wheel. The inventory system is a whole other can of worms. The fact that characters and even vehicles have inventory space is genius if you ask me, but the implementation is confusing at first and awkward once you get used to it.  ArmA  is everything about PC simulators that both intrigued and scared away console users in previous decades, but applied to today’s technology.   If you’re still willing to stick with it for the gameplay opportunities I described earlier in this review, you’ll also have to forgive Bohemia for not having EA or Ubisoft money despite doing things far more ambitious than either. That means animations that are downright robotic compared to Uncharted, PS1-era voice acting, and massive glitches despite years of bug squashing. To be honest the vanilla AI still doesn’t really know how to navigate indoors. AI driving? Good God.   Then you’ve got  ArmA's  overall performance. It’s hell on CPUs, for both reasonable and bad reasons. This is a game that will calculate the trajectories of bullets 20 miles away from you and the decisions of every character firing them. On the other hand,  ArmA 3  mostly uses only one or two CPU threads, so raw clock speed is more important here than cores. This game probably benefits more than most others from CPU overclocking. On my stock i5-4670k at 3.5GHz it’s not unusual to have framerates in the 20’s for minutes on end. Bohemia is slowly trying to bring this game and  DayZ  into modern DirectX versions but it’s been a slow process.  Still, you have to give Bohemia credit for adding to and tweaking the game as much as it has been for three years. Since launch there have been massive changes to the way weapons work, the lighting system, and the audio. With the  Apex  expansion coming soon, it doesn’t look like Bohemia’s gonna stop developing this game for a while.   ArmA 3  is one of my favorite games to play right now, but that’s because I’m so entranced by the scale and freedom of its missions that I’m willing to put up with an incredibly clumsy user experience. If the standard COD or BF experience completely satisfies you and you’re just looking to see how  ArmA  competes then you’ll probably find it to be a poor-man’s version from a bunch of weirdos in the Czech Republic. Anyone willing to dive into obtuse command interfaces to reach the expanded possibilities within, piles of mods to continually customize the game, and toy around with a hardcore sandbox, will find a quintessential modern example of PC simulation gaming.",

I would say just dont buy into this game and get Arma 2 until all the DLCs and game is complete thus saving you a lot of money in the end on things you should already have given we payed the full price of the game like the people need to now.",

Me and my friends are in a gang war with some enemies and have been searching for them throughtout the map or an entire hour. We eventually decide to do a drug deal with them because the drug traders arent safe. We go to the airport and I set up in a tower to watch over while my leader is outside the building and my frends are outside. All of the sudden our leader gets taken out and to guys go over to loot his body. In the meanwhile, they've got a heli flying over and guys infiltrating the building my friends are in. I immediatly take the two guys out from the tower and move to a different position. One of my friends was shot in the building and the other took the enemy out. We eventually clear out the building and the heli flew away.  I hope this helped. You really need to gett this game its worth well over how much they price it at.

The added weapons, UI, co-op campaign, vehicles, and sounds have been a huge welcomed addition. The island and jungle remind of the Dominican traveling through the country. The spatial sound and environment sounds are so well done, it really puts you in the jungle. I'm once again impressed by the team and this expansion just seems to 'Click'.

He says into his radio, his sirens wailing and lights flickering. I take a sharp turn to the left, making the officer fly 20 feet into the sky, his hatchback giving its final, saddening yell before plummeting to the ground, exploding and killing the officer on impact.  I turn around, a Hunter and two SUVs headed my way: I must escape quickly! I held shift, accelerating my car by 10km/h. I proceeded down the road that I originally aimed for, soon turning into a dark alley to avoid contact with the law-enforcement.   'NEEEEEEOW!'  A series of blue lights and sirens sounded past my location. I was safe; or at least I thought so. Before I could realise, a PD helicopter was patrolling the skies, soon discovering and announcing my location. As its beam of light beaconed at me, I reversed from the tight space, and sped to the town centre - Kavala square.   Disobeying the speeding limit, I held my finger firmly on the shift key, knowing that if I let go I'd be trampled and macerated by the Hunters that persued me. Realising that the whole of Kavala PD was now shadowing me, I lead them to their unexpected deaths: attempting to de-sync ram those like the detective I eliminated before. It wasn't long until they raced down the street - I stuck the front of my vehicle out of the gap, sending the impenetrable Hunter to its destined death.  Untouched, my car remained in pristine condition, however I was still in pursuit. Locked onto me, the chopper hovered above, revealing my position. Intimidated, I abandoned my Offroad and scrapped my clothes, sprinting to the suit-store. I purchased a cheap hobo-outfit and ran back to my car, only to realise it is now under the jurisdiction of the cops as they formed a road-block, defending the crime-scene.   Attempting to explain to the officers that the vehicle belongs to 'my friend', they stated that I should leave. In protest, I stole (however I do not think of it as stealing, rather borrowing my own ride) the OffRoad, detonating two police cars and myself during the process.  TLDR: I rammed some cops, abandoned the car, changed clothes, stole the vehicle back and we all exploded.",

It has tons of content, and it's still being updated regularly. The DLC is honest and a lot of it is free to try.  I guess this game is the closest to an army simulation you can get. Adding mods and playing online (look up a3l or ccg launchers) and a whole new world opens up.  I recommend this because I come back to every time. 300+ hours and more to come. See you there ;)",

Sprawling from the singleplayer military campaign to the amazing world of Altis life, you are free to do what you want within the world of Arma. The world is one of the best i've seen, with millions of manually placed objects to make it feel as though it is real life. The multiplayer gunfights are gripping, but sometimes unfair as the PVP isn't the best i've ever seen, but it still does it's job! On multiplayer you will experience lower FPS than in singleplayer, but anyone who has played this game will understand that it doesn't matter. The game is too good to even pay attention to your rapidly decreasing FPS!  Overall I'd rate this game a 8.5/10. A few things could be improved here and there such as hitboxes, and the lag that you experience in multiplayer. But apart from that, this game is a must buy for any FPS fan!",

Just starting and playing the campaign which incorporates only the best aspects of all previous releases and campaigns starting from CWC down to Red Harvest in ArmA2, we have: 1. Fast paced action as in CWC - You usually start in the action or closeby, no longer do you need to relocate over miles to get into your AO 2. A small unit gameplay as was featured in the Red Hammer campaign. 3. Weapons and Magazines carry over to next mission, as seen in Resistance 4. Campaign with optional sidemissions, as seen in Armed Assault and Queens Gambit 5. Sidemissions may include long range scouting with dynamic elements, as created by the community and similarily featured in the Red Harvest campaign  The inventory system has been completly overhauled and provides a lot more possibilities than previous releases, instead of slots (which are still kind of there) you now have a weight limit similar to what ACE mod previously suggested. Pack a lot of stuff and you will drain stamina more quickly, on the other hand don't carry much stuff or heavy armor around with you and you can run for miles - but a single bullet can put you down and you risk running out of ammo.  Movement controls have been streamlined to provide a more simple and user-friendly experience akin to ArmA CWA, and in contrast to the 2 previous releases. You have a lot of options, though you do not need to map everything.  Then we have the new battlefield that was added in ArmA3, SCUBA ops are provided with a realistic scenery, sadly you are not able to do much under water other than using your weapons or pre-defined actions (thus only scripted actions).  Also the AI still gets stuck in buildings and behaves erratic under fire sometimes, i am pretty sure there will be mods to fix that though.  Well to finish this review: I just go this 2 days ago and i already feel i will be addicted to this masterpiece for quite a while (check it: 24 hours spent in game already), if you're one of the oldschool players who turned their back on ArmA after the last 2 releases: You MUST get this, you simply MUST.

BE AWARE Arma 3 was suposed to have been made, user friendly as far as mod and levels go, using the workshop. Unfortunatly they never made it work. It looks realy cool , you can suscribe to and post all the mod and levels you make, great.  But to play a level you subcribe to, you have to remember all it's dependencies, and load them when you start the game. This makes it imposible to just jump in and play, making the game lame and troublesome. example :  If I want to continue 3 missions tonight, I have to remember all the mod dependency names, load them in the menu and restart 3 times.  That's realy what you get after, you brush away all the Workshop hype.  Why is Workshop not properly implemented? The developer of Arma have been and are still making the same mistakes over and over. They just keep adding stuff, without fixing obvious and very important stuff.  Like the workshop problem mentioned, or the annoying crouch after map problem or the gun always up in my face, or undrivable vehicles due to the CAN'T see out the window problem, or the houses built alsmot on the road realy (The town owns 3 meters on both sides you can't build there). And the DLC makes it realy bad, can't use the stuff or you force others to purchase it. Apex campain is silly and short, not at all realistic, and useless in solo mode.  Any how, great game, if they fix the problems. For now just be aware, of the not properly implemented WORKSHOP. (only half works)  I personaly spend more time in Arma2 because of these problems.",

            "review_text": "UPD: FPS tanks when fired upon, this is ♥♥♥♥ing unplayable.  There you go, saving and loading now works fine with ACE3. Now I can go with an actual review.  The game suffers horribly from lack of content and weak campaign. The DLC barely add anything yet they require ~$30 for at least Helicopters and Marksmen. Both DLCs add a few choppers and sniper rifles that should have been in the base game in the first place. But Bohemia decided to follow the extremely anti-consumer trend and ads for these DLCs pop up everywhere in the game. I can forgive Karts, they're cheap and actually add more than Helicopters and Marksmen. Now Apex, on the other hand, is an actual Expansion Pack, adding a new map, a new campaign, new stuff everywhere. And the funny thing is that Apex is only a little more expensive than Helicopters and Marksmen. Care for a price drop, Bohemia? I doubt it.  While OFP and Arma 2 were enjoyable without mods, Arma 3 was clearly developed with mods as life support in mind. You will not enjoy Arma 3 without mods. There's only a little bit of content for BLUFOR and OPFOR which absolutely need an expansion through various mods - you will get tired fairly quickly from the same guns and vehicles.  The campaign was abysmal even in comparison to campaigns from Arma 2 Expansions. Characters abruptly killed off, characters dissappearing from the story until the very last mission, a story-critical McGuffin appearing at the very same mission, no explanations at all, et cetera, et cetera. And yes, the campaign itself also abruptly ends.  Now to the good side. The controls are a bit smoother than Arma 2 - I particularly like the combat pace and simple bipod resting. The aiming is improved - now you can actually zoom into an RCO and not go into another screen. Sway is debatable, but it's more realistic, so I don't mind it most of the time. The new maps are quite big and nice. The graphics are great and the optimization at the time of writing this review isn't that bad when we talk about Bohemia. The original OFP music cues are back with a vengeance, they got amazing remixes.  But in the end, I cannot recommend you this game at full price with its amount of problems. I'd suggest that you buy this if Arma 3 + Apex would be $60. But the base game does not worth it at all, better stick to Arma 2 until it gets on sale. That's what I did, but I still kinda regret buying it.  Either way, DO NOT EVER BUY the DLCs unless they go -90% at a Steam Sale or something.",

The way I'm going to do this is give you my overview, then I will break the game down into pros and cons. If you want to skip to the pros and cons of this game just scroll down a bit.  Overview: I have always wanted to play a game that encompassed the feel of war, many games these days make war seem much more fast paced than It really is. ArmA 3 takes its time in creating an environment that turns hours into week long deployments. If you are wanting a realistic hardcore simulator, without the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t this is your game.  THE CONS   Clipping is bad, you can just crawl through some walls by running and pressing 'z'.   Player base is mostly toxic.   Horribly Optimized.   Steep Learning Curve.   Bad Campaign.   Lack of direction after completing the game.   Horribly Optimized. (x2)  THE PROS   Beautiful Graphics   Player base (with external units) is generally accepting and kind.   Plethora of game modes.   Great community mods.   Realism.   Depth of combat.   Precision of military recreation.   Active Development.   New DLC launching all the time.   Community focused development team.   Generally a good game.  CONCLUSION  This game is a must have if you are interested in a large scale military sandbox. The multiplayer is amazing and the campaign, whilst bad, is still bearable. If you are on the fence about purchasing this game, do it. I recommend joining a unit, this will give you a group to help learn and master the game. Although if you do not have the best CPU on the market, i3-i7, you will not be getting the usual fps you would expect from an older PC game. Expect 30-60, depending on the areas of the map you are in!  I rate this game... 8/10, due to optimization being horrible.  ",

In fact I have bought 3 copies for friends since my own purchase. I bought initially for the new Epoch Mod, which at time had not been released, and found many other game modes to play, in the mean time. From Wasteland to King of the Hill to Life and later Battle Royale and Breaking Point. I would say that half my hours have now been spent in Epoch for Arma 3, I have to say I am personally very fond of what they have produced so far and am excited for the mods further development. What ever brings you to buy Arma 3 though I do not think you can fail not to be impressed by its scope and depth, nor remain unimpressed by the ingenuity of its modding community. Buy it! Play it! Love it!  Update for Apex Expansion Overall so far disappointed in the expansion, Tanoa is beautifully detailed but resource heavy on your PC. Buildings are only 50% enterable compared to 99.9% of Altis a huge step backwards in map design and execution.  Whilst there are new factions, weapons and vehicles there are still no women in the Arma 3 world!  Would i still recommend Arma 3, hell yes! Would I buy the expansion version? Harder to answer in the positive, but if on offer and within your budget it would be good to have the new map and units and vehicles and weapons to access despite the expansion's other failings.  Now using the Eden Editor to make missions and edit maps and it opens up a whole other dimension to Arma 3's potential and playability. So much still to learn and loving still!",

If you dont buy it you cant use the weapons other people may drop which is not even making any sense.

The game has gone through a lot of changes and has came a long way from what it was in alpha. Ive kept with arma since the beginning and checked out all the new updates when they released. Bohemia does care about the game (even if the cost of DLC doesnt show it) and will try to fix any bugs or add awesome new things into the game on a regular basis. The modding community is what really makes the game though. Theres loads of different mods, from sifi to realism you can most likely find some kind of mod that is amazingly fun to play with. As of this review (12/15/16) Arma 3 is still a 32 bit game, which means it takes a good computer to get a solid frame rate at higher settings. Bohemia has announced they are making a 64 bit version of arma to be released soon so I hope that will finally take some of the performance issues out of the question. Now this game is not perfect by any means, and has a good amount of bugs that can be game breaking at times and are very annoying to deal with, but IMO its worth it to deal with a few bugs to have such a fun game.",

There is no stability. But I recommend it anyway. It is hard to understand but it's just the perfect military simulation once you start to know how to play.",

Need less to say I'll be spending countless more hours running, gunning, driving, shooting, missing, killing, and most importantly.... dieing.   That being said Arma 3 is an incredibly fuliling game. From casual dicking around, to hardcore roleplaying and milsim and everything in between. Theres almost no other game like Arma. It's huge sandbox is capable of most anything you can imagine. It's realistic ballistics are incredible and one of the best features of the game. It's ability to be modded allows the modding community to provide you with always varied gameplay. All of these features and many more are the reasons Arma is one of my most favorite games and the game I think I've ever played the most of.    Arma is also incredibly demanding in several aspects. The most important of which is hardware. Even a gaming PC that can play most other games on ultra without missing a beat, May still have trouble with this game. This game is considerably CPU intensive. Stick with intel processors over AMD processors. Even on Standard to High settings my OC'd FX-8350 4.8GHz CPU and GTX 770 has trouble getting a consistent 30 fps on highly populated servers.   ",

(I personally recommend the life servers) Great game mechanics, and different ways to play such as tactical, stealth, and full out guns blazing. one of the best war simulations out there. 10/10.....................................

Make the Ravioli dough.  - Crack eggs into a large mixing bowl and beat them with a fork. Add water, oil, and salt. Mix. - Add 1 cup flour to the bowl. Use a fork to mix the flour with the eggs, water, oil, and salt. Repeat with the rest of the flour. Mix until a smooth dough is formed. - Clear and clean off a large work surface and dust it with flour. This is where you are going to roll out your dough. - Take the dough out of the mixing bowl, shape it into a ball, and place it on your work surface. Knead for at least 10 minutes or until it becomes elastic. - Dust a rolling pin with flour to prevent the dough from sticking. Roll out the dough until it is about 1/8 inch (1/3 cm) thick, or about the thickness of 2 stacked quarters. - With a cookie cutter or upside-down water glass, cut out circles in the dough (will make about 15-20 dough circles). - Ball up the unused dough and either roll it out and make a couple more raviolis, or wrap it and put in the freezer for another time. Dough can keep for weeks when frozen. Just make sure to wrap well so that it doesn’t suffer from freezer burn or absorb freezer odor.   Fill the Ravioli shells.  - Take the ravioli filling out of the refrigerator and place a tablespoon of it in middle of a dough. - Fill a small bowl with water, dip your fingers in, and moisten around the outer edge of the dough circle. - Fold the dough in half over the filling, making a half-moon shape. Be sure all the filling stays inside. Pinch the edges together and then seal the edges of the ravioli with a fork. Make sure to press firmly and go all the way around. This will add a “homemade” touch as well. - Repeat this process for all your dough circles. - Dust the finished ravioli with flour to keep them from sticking together.   Form the Shells and Fill Using a Ravioli maker.  - Roll the dough into two sheets - Place one sheet on the ravioli maker, and form the filling cups. - Fill with the ravioli mixture. - Lay the second sheet of dough on top, and roll it out. This will seal in the filling. - Remove and separate the finished raviolis.  Cook the Ravioli.  - Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil. - Place the ravioli in boiling water for 5-6 minutes, or until they float. You can also test for doneness by nibbling on the edges to test. - If you don't want to make all the ravioli at one time, you can freeze the rest  - Take ravioli out of boiling water with large slotted spoon and place on warmed plates  Serve it up. Top with your favorite sauce, grate some fresh cheese over it, and enjoy!",
