    "description": "Six years have passed after the events of 2226 A.D. The balance in the galaxy has been restored as transgalactic corporations have been deported to the outskirts of the galaxy and deprived of their power. The Empire, just as before, continues to fight against the Aliens. As a rule armadas of battleships aren't used in such conflicts.",

Know what you are getting into before you buy. You will need multiple save files, and to save at each stage of a mission in a new file.  However, the gameplay is good and fun. I have played Sw 1 and 3. Therefore i know roughly what is going on. If you are presistent, and enjoy this type of game it is worth your time, knowing the above.",

Most of the time I spent just moving from one system to another. One major battle at the end and curtain went down  Review: it is so short, that there is basically impossible to evaluate the game. It brings the whole piece down and shame on original game, which was good fun. This is barely size of an add-on, to call it Star Wolves 2 is an outrage. I am really happy that I haven't bought it by the time it was presented, because spending 50 euros or more on such thing would be madness. It is really sad for anyone who liked the first episode that when it came to inventing tasks and story line, the only thing that has landed on paper is one exquisite ♥♥♥♥. Writer must have been either painfully underpaid or utterly useless. Or maybe he just learned that he suffers from some horrible terminal disease and could not finish what otherwise would certainly have been piece of his lifetime. That there are three story lines does not sooth the bitter taste at all",

The music is decent, voice acting terrible (in the first game, the voice actors didn't speak English too well, but it was a lot better, and had more actors). The game's incredibly easy, it lets you get insane amounts of money from the equipment dropped by the enemies (which are also easy). It's insanely linear - fly to this sector, pretend that you don't expect a trap, kill everyone, fly to a different sector, repeat. Buy the first one (it was good), but forget that such a disgrace as is Star Wolves 2 exists.",
