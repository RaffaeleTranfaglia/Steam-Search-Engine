The combat has improved a lot,and it's much faster now,i think the game has improved quite a bit and it even has some minigames now.   If you enjoyed the previous games i'm sure you will be pleased with this one.",

I played the 2 other agarests game on steam and this one is clearly the best. It's true that the battle system SEEMS too complex in the beginning because you don't have enough skill choices but it becomes interesting later on (Gen 1~ middle).  It still contains a lot of 'fanservice' scenes (mostly CG) and the massage minigames are... well... a bit over the top for me but they're not mandatory. But the core of the game is the battle system and it's really fun but hard to master :)  Don't listen to the trolls saying it's 'censored'. The only cut content is 2 CG and the massage minigame with (child) Fiona... Doesn't matter at all because it doesn't affect anything...",

Storyline, and everything else seems to be on par with what we've grown to love... The gameplay changed. Yes, its more interactive, although, I missed the old RPG menu battle style, which is what I fell in love with about the first one, and the genre in general.  Still, a good game by Compile Heart, who also worked on Hyperdimension Neptunia. I'll still reccomend this,  but, I'll reccomend you play Agarest: Generations of War, and Agarest: Zero first.",

The only reason I wouldn't recommend this to people over the PS3 version is that it is censored. The puritanical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in recent years despite the world collectively becoming more mature is ridiculous.   Companies need to learn that censorship in any form is wrong.",

            "review_text": "I really wanted to love Agarest War 2. It was pretty good, not great, until I got to the True Ending. It was all down hill from there. There were so many steps to get this ending that I had to follow a very specific guide. Of course, that alone doesn't bother me, but after all that, there are 8 more bosses you have to beat that are so much stronger than anything you have faced before. Suddenly, grinding for hours is a must.  Unless the battle system is amazing, I really hate grinding. Agarest War 2's battle system is certainly different, but not especially interesing and in some cases, not especially fun. On top of that, the frame rate of this game just kept getting worse and worse. Battles became painful moments I had to slog through. I still could barely scratch the first boss.   Something tells me that beating these bosses is possible in New Game +, which is complete nonsense. This game is not good enough to warrant a second playthrough.   I do not recommend this game unless you are really into massaging anime girls to raise their stats and get them to like you. Oh, that's a thing by the way. The three bath house minigames star you and your many hot, female party members in various states of undress. I did not find them enjoyable. They are not required, unless you want the True Ending, which I did.  TLDR The gameplay is just okay until the framerate starts to suck. The minigames made me feel unclean. The True Ending requires stupid levels of grinding.",

            "review_text": "Yeah I picked up this game only because I wanted to see if it was as bad as so many people have placed it.  BLUF: (Bottom line up front) The first game was the hight of this series, even zero was a pale comparison to it  It is! In its defence it would have been better if it was a spin off.  -The continents are so strange you can't place what one is what unless you memorized the names. -The Cast is so bad that you won't even be mad anymore that you have 2 less people in your party -The spell lists and books seem like a cool way to specialize your party, but both the skills given and the powers you recieve are worthless once you get the power of Arc-An-Ciel (AAC) -The main story is so pathedic that you mainly just use skip in order to get to the next crapy battle  The good parts of the game are very few -All party members get exp now, so no longer will you have a party member under leveled at a special battle that only they are in (which is also gone) -Battles are faster (if you didn't use auto battle for easy fights in the first two) -You can change your party mid battle (This one was actualy amazing)  Neutral parts of the game (good/bad depending on player) - No longer are your weapons key points of skills you can have, now it is only better stats. making end game items no longer character specific - Flashy combos are replaced with finnishing moves (no AP required, just tokens you get for break gage) allowing for quicker flow, and the ability to use multiple times in combat (even more then once on one foe) - Mini game added to agument relationships (good for those that want to experience a different story options but still want to keep brides happy to pick them at end of generations)  Worst part of battles in this game, is that you had to specialize your characters so much in atks (one char had only holy atks ect) in order to take advantage of weaknesses cause of the crapy rotation skills. But with the low skill count in thsi game for a large portion of it made it worthless once you started to get enough for specializing (See AAC)  I did drop this game due to lack of interest, and just watched a speed up 'lets play' in order to see what I missed (which was my time and money)  WORST PART OF THE GAME IS THE DEMAND FOR MINI GAMES! and it was made for a controler or motion control. so the port to the computer was bad for adjusting for true ends.  I believe that games like this, that abandon all the qualities that makes a game great and unique, end up killing otherwise worthly franchises.  Final review: Only get this game if you A)Didn't enjoy the battle system of the prior ones B)Didn't enjoy the fact that wrong decitions in the story could prevent you from choosing a bride at end of generations C)you REALLY want to see a sequil (oh wait japan companies dont care about us, so I guess a port when/if they make one?)",
