            "review_text": "Transistor is a brilliant 2D sci-fi action-indie RPG, brought to us by Supergiant games – as most of us know, are the creators of Bastion. While Transistor doesn’t exactly play like Bastion, I’ve still enjoyed my time with it. The hand-drawn visuals are fantastic and oozes style. Darren Korb composed the soundtrack and it's a delightful treat for the ears.   The gameplay is fun &amp; unique. The player takes control of Red (the main female protagonist), who has the ability to freeze time and plan out attacks – which is called a 'Turn()'. A well-played 'Turn()' can be rewarding and its especially satisfying watching your attacks play out In motion.  I know we’re all going to make this comparison, but Transistor plays more like an RPG than Bastion. You level up, gain new skills and can customize them to your liking. Fans of Bastion and newcomers who are unfamiliar with Supergiant games will without a doubt have a blast playing Transistor. I highly recommend this game!",

            "review_text": "Transistor is a sci-fi action rpg from Indie studio Supergiant Games (The makers of Bastion).  You play as Red, a famous singer from the city of Cloudbank. An incident occurs that leads you down a path of no return. In the process, you receive the mysterious weapon known as the Transistor and the powers that come along with it.  Gameplay consists of real time combat mixed with an optional turn-based system. At anytime during normal combat, you can pause the game to plan and queue up attacks. This proves immensely helpful when you face large numbers of enemies at once.  As you progress through the game, the Transistor gains new powers. These can be used in either active (attack), support (supplement attack), or passive modes. The level to which you can customise powers to complement your playstyle is one of the highlights of the game.  The visuals of the game are another strong point. The artstyle is stunning. Great use of colours and imaginative design bring out the vibrancy and beauty of Cloudbank. This is a city you'd want to save.  Voice acting and music is stellar. The soundtrack is atmospheric and easy on the ears, while the voice acting is filled with character.  The plot can be ambiguous but if you pay attention it makes sense by the end of the game.  The only downside is that a single playthrough lasts 6 hours or so. Some may find the $20 sgd pricepoint too high for that length, although there is a new game plus option that provides some replayability.  tldr: A polished, unique Indie action rpg albeit a little short. Highly Recommended",

            "review_text": "Basically, this is Bastion with a 'software' theme. The art and music are outstanding, though very similar to Bastion, as is the attention to detail.  There are loads and loads of programming references, which I found absolutely delightful, being a software engineer.  You don't have to be a software engineer to enjoy the game, though. Like Bastion, the game is perfectly accessible to anyone. It's been described as an RPG-lite, but there's plenty of gameplay complexity. The combat is a mix between ARPG and TBS.  There are even a few 'puzzles' (game calls them 'tests') thrown in, where you are challenged to win a fight by utilizing your abilities in specific ways. These tests are a way of educating you on the combat mechanics.  There's plenty of strategy involved, including the ability to make combat more difficult in exchange for a small exp bonus. I played at effectively the highest difficult setting and enjoyed the challenge. I'm probably going to continue through the second playthrough for additional challenge.  The first playthrough is fairly short, but never feels tedious, either. The second playthrough can be taken to extend play time by quite a bit. I like the game length. Some might complain about the price point, but I think it's fair for a quality indie title like this.  There are stability issues at the moment, but they are rapidly being patched, so I expect those to mostly be resolved soon. I mainly encountered problems with the optional 'tests' deadlocking (?) and requiring manual process termination. Glancing at the forums, this seems to be related to the online features, which are understandably more difficult to test prior to release, so it's not exactly fair to ask 'don't these people test their game?'  Also, there's not much character development and no real character interaction (though there's plenty of good voiceover). Some might miss that, but it didn't bother me. The focus is on atmosphere. I liked the way the game slowly revealed the backstory and made you work for some of it - revealing character biographies if you used your abilities in different ways.  I liked the story, though I may be biased given the theme :)  In conclusion, I highly recommend this.  Disclaimer: I only played 30 minutes into Bastion so far, so I'm not very qualified to compare the two titles. (Yeah, I know, I'll get around to finishing it eventually)",

The story hooked me right from the start. I literary downloaded this game, played nonstop and finished in a little over five hours. Now I am still awake at 3AM feeling compelled to write a review about how much I loved this game. I really do not have any words that will do any justice to this unique and beautiful world that I completely fell in love with. This will, hands down, be the best buy of the 2014 Steam Summer Sale.",

            "review_text": "I've been thinking for some time that cinema is leaving the spot open for new ways of storytelling. Videogames have tried to take that spot over the years, ofering now a great tool for writers and devs to reach their audience in ways movies can't.  This level of inmersion is often used to put the player in other character's shoes, offering experiences with more or less background. Transistor favours the storytelling in spite of some of this inmersion, making the player an observer, not giving you absolute control, getting carried by the events, giving you a broader view of what it has to deliver. And what a way to deliver it. Transistor executes flawlessly everything it attempts. It doesn't offer you the latest in graphics, the best music or the most action-packed gameplay, but it makes sure you enjoy every last bit of it. Don't take me wrong, the hand drawn graphics look gorgeous, the music is great and the gameplay is very, very enjoyable, but it's the way it delivers it to the player, what makes Transistor one of the very best games I've ever played. And I've been around since the 80's. The game takes all the good things from Bastion, all kinds of influences from our day, and builds a vivid, original world, so full of life and personality it makes everything else look so run-of-the-mill, so old and used. It tells the oldest Story ever told, a Tragedy. But it's the characters, the world they inhabit, the references to our world, the little details, the pauses, the many readings anyone can take from this story... It's more than just a game, just a story. It's an interactive piece of art.  To sum it all up, don't miss this experience if you're looking for something else than quick, mindless fun in a game, because you'll be missing a classic. This game is gonna be high up in the history of videogames, at least as one of those 'hidden gems', and will bring you memories (and probably a smile) when you stumble upon it in some years.  Indie games are offering new, fresh, great ideas and masterpieces like Transistor only proves that it's a very good time to be a gamer, enjoy it while it lasts.",

UI has some issues, though -- you'll encounter them when you'll be trying to customize your loadout. But nevertheless, game is extremely good -- must have, if you ask me.

But when i started to play, and i was going deeper and deeper, i knew that this game deserve for those good opinions.  But let's start from the begining. Transistor is a typical arkade RPG, where we will try to find a previous users of the sword (Transistor) and try to discover the true Transistor's destiny. To do that we will have to defeat a whole armies of enemies which we will have to stand and fight with them. Yeah, fight system in this game is just great! We have a lot of various skills that we can combine with each other to gain a brand new skill! Isn't it just great? But let's go forward. Through the game i have made a lot of screen shots, more than i'm usualy making during a game, becouse this game have an awesome audiovisual layer, it's more like an art not a game. I love the songs composed by Darren Korb and Ashleu Barrett it just fit great in the game, i literaly can lisen a soundtrack a whole hours. The storyline is also a strong part of Transisotr, i remember that when i was finishing the game it felt like - WHAT? WHAAAT? Wow, this game is awesome!   Well... after all, do i recomend the game? Definitly - yes! One of my fav game so far. 10/10",

Transistor has a few things in common with Bastion - Great voiceover, compelling world and story that reveals itself through the narrative, the solitude of the main character, interesting art style and unique enemies and the combat is similar (yet at the same time completely different).  Transistor is beautiful (if you like this animation style), the music of the game is simply fantastic and the story flows well towards the inevitable conclution. The fighting is innovative and clever and makes you want to try out all the combinations.  The game is not without flaws though - it is highly linear and constantly pushes you through the quite short story arc. Exploration is not really present so if you want to rush through the game you can do so quite fast.  Is the game worth buying? Yes!

            "review_text": "Transistor is one of those few games that feel unique. The last few years I have only got this feeling from two games, the first one was The Banner Saga, and now Transistor. This is a game that when I sit down playing it I don't wanna stop, but I dont really want to continue either, because i'm thinking: The game is probably quite short.  However, for this story the amount of time was perfect, not to short and definitely not to long.  This is a very interesting RPG-game with a deep love story, in a city where very weird things are going on.  I must say that at first I was very confused, but the longer I played it the longer I was drawn into the story and into the world of Transistor.   Together with the exellent art-style and magnificent soundtrack this game made made me more immersed than what I usually get in games, atleast since I got older. I remember that I as a kid more often got this feeling, the feeling I got from Banner saga and now Transistor. I guess that is because I get used to it, to the way games play and the way a gaming story most often adapts.   Romance or more rather love is a huge part of the story, or it basically is and I don't feel many games use that as their spine. More games should, since it's a powerful tool to usurp our feelings. I want my feelings to get usurped by games, I really do.   This game has two main characters, one is Red, a strong female character who are fighting to get back her voice, which was stolen from her by Camerata, which is a group you don't know much about, but their intentions were at first good, but power might have corrupted them. The other protagonist is 'the' Transistor, the weapon Red uses. who throughout the game is trying to help you as much as possible.   The fighting is very interesting, as you play you will find more and more moves, or attacks that you can use during these fights. You can fight as time goes, or you can enter this... 'V.A.T.S' system (If you know Fallout 3 &amp; NV) where you get to plan your moves ahead of you and then fire them all at once without the enemy having the time to respond. However that leads to a cooldown so you can't attack for a few seconds after. I found this system very usable at times, but mostly I tend to... forget it? Or maybe I just don't appriciate it enough. It has helped me sure, but I want to kill the enemy 'myself' If that makes sence.   Whenever you get beaten enough you'll lose some attacks, which will return later on when another cooldown has counted down to zero. The most interesting part with the attacks are that you can put them together, you can strenghen one by adding the others, that however cost a few points so at the same time you have to look at a bar that show you how much points you've spend on this. While leveling up you can choose to increase that bar, or add another support slot for your weapon, etc.   I would dearly recommend this game to anyone who would like to try something different, but still very beautiful and worthwhile.",

Its a very beautiful visual art for a science fiction world. Music is absolutely beautiful with its Jazz smooth feeling.  If you have bought the Soundtrack, don't listen to it 1st before playing the game as you might ruin your experience when going though the game. The story is also very interesting as you play as 'Red' who lost her voice and its up to you to get it back.

I was first introduced to it by a show (that might be canceled) Called Reviews on The Run where they reviewed Video Games and Movies. A near perfect is what they gave it.  A year or so after Bastion was now coming to Steam. I bought it and I loved it. I loved it more than any game I had ever played before. It was amazing.  I'm glad to say that I feel the same about this game except I feel NOTHING SuperGiant makes will ever Compare to Bastion.   People are saying that it's a mix of Action and Stratagy and it came be either one if you want it to. I disagree. You have a function called Turn() Using this lets you plan out attacks ahead of time causing a stategic plan to be made. If you run in not using your Turn() like some psychopathic manic then yes, you will die. You can't just fight. You must plan.  The Soundtrack is just amazing. It takes classic Jazzy music and mixes in some more electric bounce music. That's pretty much all I have to say about the Soundtrack.  When originally seeing the art style in the first trailer from Pax Prime 2013 (I think...) I fell in love with it. When I got into actual gameplay I wasn't a huge fan at first. Now this is me being all picky just because I didn't like Red's face. Soon I got into it and it seemed fine and natural.  Overall this is a magnificant title that I recomened everyone should at least give a chance and see if you're a fan   2016-01-09: After revisiting the game I believe that this game is a true masterpiece that everyone should try.

            "review_text": "A very stylish Sci-Fi Noire-ish game about a strange and somewhat utopian city, 'Cloudbank', falling to an epidemic/invasion of some kind, 'The Process'. The protagonist, a famous musician of the city called 'Red', vanishes after one of her stage acts and finds herself right in the middle of the city's demise. The game drops you into a scene with Red pulling a tool resembling an oversized sword from someone's body, which is accompanying and talking to her and which narrates many of her actions and compensates for the city having 'taken' Red's voice, who herself is mostly silent. With this tool, the 'Transistor', you fight your way through the declining urban environment to the source of this epidemic trying to save the city.  The game is short, but very impressive. The art design feels special and there is some pretty cool music. Cloudbank is a rather mysterious city/town, the game isn't straightforward with what world, place or time you are exactly finding yourself in. The 'traces' of former certain city inhabitants absorbed by the Transistor to power your abilites while handling it in combat (fitting to their stories and roles within the city) give you hints to events predating Red's disappearance and are interesting to read - but overall the game loves leaving you in a wondering position for many parts, which (in a good, engrossing way) mystifies the whole experience and leaves room for own interpretations, possibly even for pre-/sequels or novels or other things that would build on the strong lore pieces which are there (I believe I have noticed this in the devs previous title 'Bastion' to some degree too, but to my knowledge it was never worked out further, whether that is good or bad I'm not sure).  Like 'Bastion' this is a rather 'soft' strategy action RPG in the way that you need to fight with some brains but not by being confused by millions of units and possible actions. You engage enemies with selective combat options organized at check-/savepoints, either in real-time or by utilizing a limited time-stopping/slowing planning feature. There are minor leveling elements and rather trivial but curious choices planted selectively throughout the city circling around some of its former daily routines and design questions (voting on things was popular among Cloudbank's citizens, it seems). Apparently, as a neat gimmick, the choices and a few other stats of the playerbase (like the kill count for each enemy type) are woven into this (or the game at least made me believe so). Maybe this could have been something to expend more, as it is effectively working into Cloudbank's digital and scientific ambience. You see the city through various stages of decline but without the levels building themselves up just before you (which I found somewhat irritating in Bastion), and without the 'hit and run' concept of Bastion where you would often have a sanctuary to return to and select new levels to start from. This makes your journey feel a bit more like a real series of events rather than a level clearing maze, the city more persistent and you to be 'actually there (as much as that is possible in this mysterious world). The narrator doesn't feel as annoying as the one in Bastion sometimes does, but maybe too distant - or even lethargic - at times. But this could be the idea of his role within the story. In general I was thankful to have him as my - or Red's - companion. However I would have loved to hear Red being properly voiced too I think. I'm not exactly the biggest fan of this 'silent protagonist' concept. Here it feels rather fitting though as the whole game is strange in a good kind of way, and it allows some certain love of detail to shine more for example when Red is answering to news feeds and polls on public terminals and correcting her own sentences while being in the middle of typing them to the point where she may even give up hope for the city herself - a subtle but strong way of projecting the protagonist's emotions despite her voicelessness.  There is a little sandbox-like place in which you can practice combat and take part in some challenges. It's not as big as in Bastion, but I don't think it needs to be as it would probably only distract from the main experience. A new game will retain your level and abilites and ramp up the strength of the enemies accordingly. There are modifiers too - 'limiters' - to make your enemies stronger and you level up faster, for an added challenge to whoever seeks it. That aside there doesn't seem any significant replay value, whether there are multiple endings I don't know yet. But the initial experience is an engaging and memoreable one, the game feels bold, thoughtful and determined and it's just impressive to see an apparent great vision turned so seemingly smoothly and confidently into a finished product that would very well deserve to be called a work of art.",

The vast array of combat options that open up as you progress allow for a staggering degree of customization. Unfortunately, it is also held back by several areas of weakness. The story, while featuring some interesting characters and an imaginative setting, ultimately felt small, like something that could have been condensed into just a short story or short film. The visually vibrant world you travel through feels somehow empty, devoid of life aside from the enemies you encounter. Finally, the combat never quite develops a pleasing sense of flow to it.  Supergiant Games has again raised the bar on weaving a soundtrack into a game. This time it feels even more personal to the story since the main character, Red, is the singer. Just know before you choose to buy the soundtrack that only a handful of the songs have vocals, not counting the extended soundtrack which features a lot of Red humming. Numerous of the purely instrumental tracks have found their way into my music library, but they're not the main attraction.  Similarly top notch is the voice acting. Fans of Bastion will recognize the way that it is utilized. It adds atmosphere and brings these characters to life. I must, however, disagree with the decision to have Red's voice 'taken away' right at the start of the game. She is a fully fleshed out character, not some blank slate for players to project themselves into. Yet some of that is lost by not letting her speak. It also reduces other characters in the game to mostly talking at you in monologues where there could have been conversations. I get why it was an appealing option for the developers though. It's interesting to consider how a singer would feel and react to having one of her most valuable faculties taken away. The world surely feels more bleak and lonely this way too. You even get to hear her through the songs and occasionally in written form. However, as it is I would say more was lost than gained by muting her.  While avoiding spoilers, I will say that I would have liked to have seen more out of the story. A lot of the right ingredients were there, but for the most part I would say the quantity wasn't enough or things were left too vague. I liked the characters that were there, but it could have used a couple more of them, particularly ones not affiliated with The Camerata (you're introduced to them early on). I was intrigued by the city of Cloudbank, was TOLD about some of its neat features and people, but I never SAW them. The game never fully convinced me that the place you spend most of your time in was ever lived in by everyday people. This may be a futuristic city where things like trash don't exist, but there has to have been more evidence of life left behind that could have been put into the visuals.  Finally, it seems that Transistor's most divisive aspect is its combat system. I was definitely in the camp disappointed with it at first but it does get better as you unlock more options. You have several primary 'Active' attack slots that can each be significantly altered by two secondary upgrade slots. You also have passive buff slots. Every ability, or Function as the game calls them, can only be used once until you are in New Game+ and begin getting multiples. You have to decide how you want to utilize each function: Active, Upgrade or Passive? You rarely are able to use all your functions at once.  It is in the action of battle that things start to falter. The Active functions you bring into the fight and a unique ability to briefly stop time are the only tools ever at your disposal. There is no blocking or dodging aside from normal movement. In stopping time, you have an action bar that is depleted with each action you take. Once you unpause, all the actions you just planned play out at super speed. Obviously this is extremely powerful and it is counterbalanced by disabling all actions besides movement for a time based on how much of the action bar you depleted.  The problem is that it is unsatisfying to use. It doesn't take skill to stop time and wail on an unmoving target and it's not fun to run around waiting on a timer afterward. If you forgo this superpower then you're left with, at most, four Active functions to use, and that usually breaks down to spamming one or two of them. If the game had any form of defensive maneuver, I think the developers knew you'd be far less likely to use the time stop. Yet that is the gimmick they went with. The most joy I found in combat was in frequently trying out new builds, including ones others suggested online.  Transistor teeters on the edge of whether I'd recommend it or not, but ultimately a couple of its strengths are SO strong that it belongs in the thumbs up category. I will add that if you haven't played Bastion, that is the better game to start with and to get a feel for if you enjoy how Supergiant Games crafts their products.",

            "review_text": "From the organic ways of Bastion, from the bush and jungle, from levels created by tiles floating up beneath you, we get Transistor. Where the style has evolved into a futuristic, neon-lit, already built level. The world does no longer face the problem of falling apart, but instead it is losing it's style. “The Process”---the equivalent of “The Calamity” in Bastion---covers the creativity made from humans, with a grayscaled and blocky veneer, which seems detrimental to this particular game, where style is easily the highpoint of the experience. The music this time around leaves the closeness of acoustic guitar picking(except for the beach soundtrack) and goes for a more distant, electronic and futuristic atmosphere. Distorted electric guitars and heavy bass lines accorded with ambiance make Transistor a sonically sound experience. The story is very reminiscent of Bastion, but yet completely different. Transistors style and sound design, as with Bastion, perfectly accompanied each other. At points I felt like the levels were specifically made with the soundtrack in mind, because it was so eerily well thought out.   We start of as Red, a singer that lost her voice(it found its way to the soundtrack, though). Standing above a man with a sword in his chest. This sword can talk to us, and also play the roll as narrator. Why only this man can speak through the weapon is unknown to me, since the player ingest other fallen men and women and gain powers through this procedure, but not their voices as with the first body. At this point of the game we don't know who this man is or why we should follow his advice or directions, but it's a game, so we do it anyway. We progress through the levels and gradually begin to understand the situation, “The Process” was a failed experiment from “The Camerata” and the city is conveniently told to evacuate, so we can have that barren emptiness that is so effective when it comes to atmosphere. And The Process is what haunts us throughout the game. As we try to get to the bottom of what happened.   The vagueness and convolution of the story straddles the line of being annoyingly vague and mysterious and intriguing. Where at some points I feel the story would be better told if you knew some of the things you are told in the end. That would make everything feel more natural. In this mysteriousness, the story was overshadowed by the stylistic choices and obligatory gameplay sections. It's unfortunate when Transistor could have been both if they just dropped any pretensions of being deeper and having more substance than there really was. When you get to the end of this two hour game, things will be rather clear, but you will also feel like there should be more, where there are hints and ways the story could have gone that were never shut down or explored in a satisfying way. Despite it not feeling as fulfilling as it seemed to have the potential for, it was enjoyable and the game easily grabbed you and kept you interested up until the end.   The gameplay seems to be a rather contentious subject. I for one, sort of liked it. You could play it like in Bastion, hack and slash, designing your “build” for this purpose. Or you could go a more tactical way, as with a controller I thought would be more suiting. And it was! Although the combat often boiled down to using your tactical slow down time mechanism, killing one foe to then run around, trying not to die until the cooldown ran out, I really enjoyed it. There was tension in that way of playing, trying to just avoid getting hit, spamming RT. While some abilities seemed useless to me, most of them were used at some point due to the fact that you lose an ability when you lose all your health. This was a clever way of making the player use all the different devices, but it's equally as dumb when you have you remake your whole build every time you “die”. The frustration of having to go in to the these access points and try to manage your attacks when half of the things you want to use are unusable somewhat breaks immersion. See Transistor tries to squeeze in a whole bunch of different attacks and combinations into, what was for me, a two hour experience. Perhaps if the game was longer and had more uses for some of the attacks, this wouldn't be so jarring and above all boring. However, when you had the attacks you wanted, with the combinations and everything, the gameplay was a lot of fun. Beautiful colors emitted from every blow, cool sound design and every attack felt more or less powerful, but alas, that didn't mean they were.   All in all it's neat parcel. Well worth it for the creativity. The clumsiness of some decisions didn't come close to ruining the experience whatsoever. So it's a worthy successor to Bastion, and it will probably stay in the same place in my mind as Bastion. As a memory of a stylistically and sonically amazing experience, while the gameplay and storytelling will surely fade out of the collective memory, sooner or later.",

            "review_text": "*Acknowledgment*  Before I delve into my review of Transistor, let me first state that I am first and foremost a tremendous fan of Supergiant Games. They released Bastion in a time I had ceased playing video games, because I found the quantity over quality insignia that most modern games paraded to be a bit much to bear. With that one release they managed to quickly overturn my decision to abstain from video games. So let me just say (to my own fault) that I have a very soft spot for the company and the diligent employees they keep.  *End Acknowledgment*  - With the acknowledgment in mind, I would like to begin with the good about Transistor.  The strongest point for the whole game, in my opinion of course, is the soundtrack produced by Darren Korb. I could create a lengthy description for this, instead, I will just tell you “listen to the soundtrack”. The man is probably one of the best composers in video game culture, that is all.  The artwork of Jen Zee is a wonderful thing to behold, and deserves to be seen. This game is no exception to that. As well, as always, Logan Cunningham's voice acting is an equal treat.  The setting, world building, and most of the story are solid and deserve recognition.  These things all speak strongly for themselves and no words I can put to them will do them justice.  - Now with the bad.  The battle system, while tremendously innovative, is irritating at best. I respect their attempt, but it clearly needed a great deal more work for creating a sense of balance. It contains all of the elements of strategy and turn-based RPGs that could be considered bad, without any of the rewards, progression, or smoothness. All in all, I feel that this aspect alone could have used at least another few months of consideration, if not a year, as it just feels hastily prepared and self-righteous.  The length of the game adds to the feeling of speedy preparation without consideration. Now don't get me wrong, There are some situations where a small number of episodes, or a few hours of your time can move a piece of multimedia to create a lengthy wake of contentedness. This is not one of those cases and while replay is certainly an option, I feel completely no urge to do so. They try to expand the game with a number of puzzle based battle-challenges to unlock songs within the game, but that would bring us back to the battle system.  The last of what I say rests with the story. This section contains a number of ***spoilers,*** so you should move on if you do not want this portion of the game revealed and I will post when spoilers are finished.   As a majority, the story is interesting, explorative, and at many points, compelling. There are a few points within it, however, that while I understand most probably lend themselves to a particular ideology or thematic pursuit, are what I feel to be gargantuan mistakes in not only the story of the game, but in writing as a whole.  With the exception of Royce, each and every confrontation with the Camerata was unfulfilling, if not completely vapid of context. The characters are introduced in a very dynamic scene where they murder Red's implied and nameless lover, which is roughly the most substance you are going to get from them.   The battle with Sybil is almost confusing because it feels out of place and unexplored. We do have the before mentioned cut scene, yes, but that is all we have at that point and all we get.   Then we move on to Asher, and the seemingly implied arch-nemesis, Grant. Here we receive a number of communications with Asher along the way, which seem to be imploring you to garner at least a little bit of sympathy, if not just understanding for these characters. However, finally reaching them and discovering they had committed suicide, without properly introducing these supposed antagonists was (pardon my language) a ♥♥♥♥-poor story decision and shows (with evidence from the fantastic story writing in Bastion) that this was either a very unconsidered, or very lazy writing decision.   I must apologize for my harshness in this respect, but I feel like I can give nothing but honesty to a company who's work I am so partial of.  I must say that all of the confrontation/interaction with Royce felt incredibly well developed and was by far the most interesting part of the entire tale (with a lot of good progression leading up to it). However, the suicide of Red not only seemed entirely uncharacteristic of a protagonist who pursued the Camerata so vigorously despite her nameless lover beckoning her not to, and who also fought so desperately to prolong her life against Royce's assail to emerge to a world she can attempt to make a better place, but it also felt like an incredibly unnecessary punch to garner some strong emotional response. At pulling on heartstrings, Red's death was certainly success, but it was at the cost of abandoning all character and story development up to this point.  Now if there is an alternate ending I am unaware of, I would be willing to explore further. With things as they are though, I don't see my self playing this game again at any point in the near future.  ***end spoilers***  I had to take a lot of time to mull over how precisely I felt overall with this game, and as much as I truly desire to give this game a thumbs up, I am needing to go with the opposing thumbs down.  I do wish Supergiant a great deal of success and hope that any future releases are true gems that speak for the greatness that I know they are ultimately capable of. Also, perhaps my response to Transistor may be best summed up by the Buddhist phrase “Expectation is the root of all disappointment”.   Many people are really loving this game, and I will continue to have my gamer soft-spot for Supergiant Games, but in continuing with honesty, this game needed more development and consideration for gameplay and story and I'll just have to sit-back an enjoy the soundtrack and artwork while waiting for the next release.",

            "review_text": "WARNING: SLIGHT SPOILERS, SO IF YOU HAVE WEAK METABOLISMS, READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH!!!  Supergiant Games have done it again. Transistor is a beautiful game that blends both gameplay and story so fluently that I forget that I am playing a game at times. The story begins with a mute singer who has just experienced her attempted murder, only to be saved by a bystander. The savior's voice and soul are transferred to the sword, which she carries around to find out what is happening to her city, and off you go.  One thing that stood out to me was the narrator's voice this time around makes more sense to actually hear, instead of Bastion's narrator, who you just sort of, could hear all the time for no real explanation. I know this really wasn't much of an issue in Bastion, but I like to see how the writers have grown up even more than Bastion's amazing story, which leads to another improvement: terminals. We've all been there trying to collect audio logs, but this time around, it's a bit different. Since Red has no voice, these terminals provide ways to communicate with the Transistor, which gives the player more motivation to go after them, rather than just skim over the story. Personally, I think this is a genius way to integrate both the present and the past stories of the game into one.  With such a great story, there has to be some glitches involved. My main problem is after the ending. And don't get me wrong, I LOVED the ending. I never thought how that would be the end, and it was a good conclusion to the arcing story between Red and her sword. But the problem is afterwards, the Recursion. In Bastion, there was a reason to play it over, as there were references to how you ended the game before, and as such have a different experience as before. But now, the game was ended with only one choice, so there really was no point to replay it, except for gameplay value. I guess the developers were going for a more linear story, which is perfectly fine, but I just expected a similar weave to the story as Bastion.  Now, I mentioned gameplay before, and it is good. Not amazing, but good. It takes Bastion's hack-and-slash type and mixes a bit of turnbased action. When a Turn is activated, one can move freely across the field setting up attacks, using up your meter above to do so. Once you are done, you then watch your actions and hopefully dominate the field. The catch with using this system is that you must wait for the meter to fill up again before you may attack again, in Turn or out of. I find that is a good balance, but if you aren't able to dominate a powerful enemy in your Turn, then you are pretty much screwed. Luckily for me, I actually liked the Turn system, but if you don't, you may not have fun with the game, especially towards the end with Man enemies, and the final boss. Which brings up what happens when you die. When Red is defeated in a battle (hence the Turn meter is down and you lose all health), she loses a function that you have under the abilities bar, and you can't get it back until you reach two different function stations. This is an interesting aspect, but it can be quite annoying, as it is often random on what you lose. For example, I once lost my main attack function, and was left with my dodge and my load functions, which do nothing in battle without a good attack. I guess this is the point as it punishes you for losing rather than just spawning you to the last checkpoint, but in my eyes, it is ultimately just wasting my time as it adds not much towards my experience except annoyance.  Another issue is the extensive upgrade system. There were many combinations that one could make with their functions, but the problem was the GUI. You had to go through each function one at a time to see what upgrade you could add to a function. This could've been simply fixed by the ability to compare the upgrades with each function, rather than the other lengthy way. Not much of an issue, but it can be hectic near the ending when you have ten functions you have to go through at a time.  Lastly, the art style. Remember Bastion's art style? How alive the world felt? Well, magnify that by 10, and add some city elements towards the environment, and you got Transistor. The colors vibrate off the screen, and you wish that the city, maybe even the enemies, were existent. Really, there isn't much to say, but to just look at. I once just stopped playing and watched the background for a good minute. The artists know to not mess with a good formula, and luckily they didn't. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- NO MORE SPOILERS AFTER, LAST PARAGRAPH/VERDICT  Transistor truly adds more to the Bastion formula, but it still latches a bit too closely towards Bastion. However, this isn't a bad thing, as Supergiant Games are playing it safe and not making a completely different game, which is what we want. We want the same feel of atmosphere from Bastion, which we got with more interactions but less replayability. We want the same gameplay feel, which we got with more options but less hack-and-slash. And we want the same story and experience, which we got with more passion but less nonlinearity. So, do I recommend Transistor? If you liked Bastion and like a bit of change, you'll love this new addition. I sure did.",

An absolutely gorgeous hand-painted cityscape with a woozy yet full-bodied soundtrack makes it clear Supergiant knew what the first thing that came to player's minds were. Throw in another smoky voiced narrator voice to follow the antangonist through to the end of the journey, and it would seem Transitor is on to another winner.  Well... it fails in a couple of fundemental ways. Yes, we can recall the lovely artstyle, music, *that* voice actor for Bastion, but part of the universal charm was the slick, smooth combat to follow up on a compelling storyline. The former is failed with Transistor, exchanging for a slightly more clunky affair, your character taking a moment to attempt most attacks, even needing to recover from the jaunt ability. The wide variety of upgrades, potions and weapon combinations are exchanged for a universal sword, the namesake of the game, with four primary abilities where you can assign your collected powers as either secondary additions, upgrading potency, number or secondary functions of your powers, and four passive slots. It seems that this could hold a lot of potential, but for the most part those combinations don't surprise or allow for in-depth theorycrafting. You just slap what you like to your abilities, make them more powerful/numerous/have an extra projectile thrown in and mash away. The 'Turn()' system also does now allow for much depth, particularly end-game considering how enemies enjoy countering or simply dodging your best laid plans.  The story starts off incredibly promising. I was anticipating a very Film Noir experience thrown in to a heavy sci-fi (Read: Not cyberpunk) universe. Alas, it mostly repeats the same apocalyptic overtones of Bastion with an unsatisfactory and, frankly, confusing conclusion that leaves far, far more questions than answers and no clear antagonist to despise, the 'Big Bad' showing up very late and with not much moustache twiddling to be had.  There are a few neat little touches that I enjoyed: The slick UI and artwork is just as gorgeous as the rendered graphics, you can see other players on their adventure via Dark Souls-esque ghosts around you, and there is even a button to hold to make the protagonist, Red, hum out a lovely counter-melody to whatever soundtrack is playing at the time. There is also, apparently, a procedurally generated post-game series of challenges to experience, but... the gameplay just didn't grab me enough to really care.  I can't *not* recommend this game. The narrator, again, just about makes it, and the relationship between him and Red's conclusion enough was sweet enough. It *is* satisfying to watch said best laid plans work out just as you expect and watch a screen full of baddies die in one little turn, and the world, despite confusing and mysterious, is at least dazzling to explore. £15 though? Wait for a sale. Even taking my sweet time I easily steamrolled through this bite-sized treat in six hours.",

They are noticeably similar, but all-together different. Bastion is more of a hack and slash, while Transistor relies on tactics and positioning to make combat the most effective. A familiar aspect, Logan Cunningham, the narrator of Bastion has returned to voice the narrator of Transistor. While the voice is the same, the tone and style of it is noticeably different. 'Rucks' of Bastion speaks like a storyteller, full of authoritative power and wisdom. In Transistor, the narrator is a large sword that holds great technological power. This narrator speaks in the constant present, holding conversations, granting advice, but there is a totally different feel to it as it seems like the narrator is more of a changing character than Rucks was. The point that I am attempting to make is that this is not Bastion 2, but still very similar to an experience that was obviously Bastion-esque. It is slower going at the beginning in my opinion than Bastion was, learning the new combat and leveling mechanics, but it is certainly worth the initial learning process.   Supergiant Games has made two of the most wonderfully designed games with Transistor and Bastion. It will be worth following their future developments, as they have made unique experiences that are worth supporting.   Also, press Tab when you're in the game.

            "review_text": "As a preface, I would like to state that SuperGiant's previous game, 'Bastion,' is one of my favourite games of all time. If I present an obvious bias or compare the two games on unfair grounds, then I appologise in advance.   First let us discuss what Transistor does right. The gameplay presented is the same isometric world navigation that was apparant in Bastion, the major difference being its approach to combat. It abandons the hectic run-and-gun/hammer skirmishes of the former and instead takes a far more intelligent plan and execute method. The player can temporarily pause time and plan out their battle strategy before hitting the pause button again and watching it play out at lightning speeds. The numerous variaties of enemies and the layouts of the battlefields provide ample chances to scratch that 'General Chessmaster' itch. The massive amount of weapons (called 'functions()') alsoadd to the tactical depth of this game. Each weapon can be equiped in one of four wepon slots, where it functions normally, firing lasers, dropping bombs etc. Each weapon may also be assigned to either a passive slot, providing you a powerful, perk-like bonus, or to an upgrade slot, in which one weapon buffs the other (LASERS THAT ALSO DROP BOMBS!?). The amount of combinations is truely staggering and will be greatly apprieciated by gamers who like a more intelligent approach to their combat (myself included).   Next the art style. Although the more charming cartoon-like character proportions from Bastion are gone in favor of a more realistic-(ish) art style, the vibrant colours and tones make a glorious return. The mood and the tone of various scenes are masterfully enchanced by use of reccuring temperatures and unique art assets. The forboding height of Coudbank City, as presented soon after the beggining of the game, is alleviated by the cool yellow and blue lighting, giving it a more distant, lonesome feeling, to give one example.   And the soundtrack, oh my, the soundtrack. I was so thrilled to hear that Darren Korb would be returning and boy does he deliver in the audio department. Echoing guitar riffs and droning synthesizers, alongside beautifully melancholic vocals do wonders to nail the sad, lonely cyberpunk feel that is so greatly apprieciated by big nerds such as myself. Particular standouts for me are 'In Circles,' 'Forecast' and 'The Spine.'  And now to cover what I personally was let down by. The story. WAIT! Allow me to expand. (No spoilers don't fret!) The characters themselves are very nicely portrayed, with excellent moments of individual characterisation, but I took issue with the game's plot, its over-arching story. You are dropped right into the world with zero idea of who these characters are, where you are, or what the hell is going on in general. 'But that happened in Bastion too!' I hear you shout. Yes you woke up in a floating bed in Bastion with zero understanding of what was happening, but this created a sense of wonder as the game's plot was quickly given to you, (The world blew up, but the Bastion can fix it) and as you progressed the world, characters and other various story flavor was gradually revealed to you in satisfying amounts from level to level. And most importantly by the game's end all questions had been answered. This is not the case with Transistor. Although it does a good job with the aforementioned characterisation and also with the same story flavor being drip fed to you, major components of the the plot are flat out not explained, which frustrated me greatly as it gave me difficulty in understanding vital things such as character motivations. These questions are also not addressed, or at least not in any way a near satisfactory level, by the games end. The final boss in particular was very confusing for me, the fight itself comes out of nowhere and takes place in a very strange location and I found myself thinking 'WHAT THE HELL IS HAPPENING? WHY ARE WE FIGHTING NOW? WHERE-WHA-BUT I DIDN'T.........' and soon after the fight the game ends. The ending itself is rather emotional, but I couldn't get into the mood the game wanted me to due to my extreme frustration and confusuion owing to the fact that the credits were rolling and my questions had not been answered. Now I'm not some fool who only enjoys simple by-the-numbers stories, I understand that not all questions need to be answered, but jesus christ SOME would have been nice. Thematically , the game is not as strong as Bastion. It is clearly attempting to make commentary on topics such as the irrelevance of an individual in a system, and the fickleness of the general public but it falls flat if suitable context is not provided.   To summerise: Wonderfully cereberal combat with powerfull art and sound direction that is only let down by its adequately explained story. Or maybe I'm just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.",

            "review_text": "Well, that was playthrough #1. After doing all challenges, listening to and reading everything I possibly could and only once having to use the 'Retry' function, Steam tells me I have 7 hours under my belt.  The following is my critique of the game, ignoring the New Game+ mode (for now). While I do reference Supergiant Games' first title, Bastion, quite heavily, the points I make should also be accessible to players who have yet to play Bastion (seriously, get that game). While I try to be objective, some sections of this review are highly subjective; the game suffers from virtually no technical (and thus 'objectively objective') faults and what I point out as bad may appear as 'creative' or 'challenging' or just 'different' to others. Please refer to additional reviews and critiques before you decide whether or not you want to buy Transistor.   THIS CRITIQUE CONTAINS VERY MINOR SPOILERS!  If you want to avoid even those, skip to the conclusion section at the end.  Transistor is an isometric tactical Action-RPG with a linear story.  First of all, the things I was happy with -   THE GOOD  : -  The MUSIC , obviously. Darren Korb and Ashley Barret did an amazing job and the music leaves little to be desired. It's a different style than Bastion's soundtrack, so, of course, whether you like it more or less than Bastion's is a matter of taste, but it is very atmospheric and carries the game together with -  LOGAN CUNNINGHAM'S NARRATION . No surprises there. The music may be the soul of the game but the expert narration (and fantastic voice acting) are its heart. -  The DESIGN . The world of Transistor is original and colorful; the 'feel' is the same as in Bastion but it has a distinctly different theme; the result is stellar. -  CUSTOMIZATION . The ability to collect a variety of skills, all of them with different effects, depending on whether they are active, passive or modifying an active skill, makes for some interesting (and tough) choices as to how you want to play. Not everything works well but you can try everything.  Now to the things that I was less impressed with -   THE MEH  : -  The COMBAT SYSTEM . Sadly, it is nowhere near as great as (I) expected. Precision is not its strong point and those who were hoping for Frozen Synapse levels of refined tactical combat will be disappointed, as will be those that expected a slick Hack&amp;Slash. Some sections are almost impossible to beat with only one of the modes but intelligent use of both does not help in all situations and more often than not (especially later on), you can find yourself cheesing the game in less-than-fun ways when you encounter fights that are frustrating enough that you'd like to skip them, due to issues with -  The BALANCING . Few enemies are balls-to-the-wall hard, but many are insanely annoying. Having to deal with enemies who have the ability to cloak themselves (which, somehow, also makes them invulnerable) without the player having any way to disrupt this cloak (other than waiting for them to deal damage to you) or to damage them in cloak makes several mid- and endgame sections downright infuriating. Especially if said enemies are rapidly regenerating health. Several enemy attacks cannot be avoided and the player's ability to heal himself is extremely limited, making the whole combat system less a matter of skill and more one of a proper choice of abilities (which is where the combat system is at odds with its RPG elements); due to this, some fights (especially boss fights) and victories are anything but satisfying and can leave a bitter aftertaste. -  The CHARACTERS . While Bastion had only a few characters with little depth but strong-enough features to make them relatable and carry the story, Transistor has almost none. 'The voice' is the strongest one by far but remains a lot more blank than Bastion's narrator. The female lead, Red, has even less than that (or Bastion's Kid). The human antagonists are hardly characterized at all and what remains is a faceless menace that changes the world around you and attacks you constantly... and yet fails to really make you feel threatened. -  The STORY . Where Bastion's story was about a simple goal for most of the game (restoring the Bastion), Transistor lacks direction. You feel like a tourist who is being guided from one landmark to the other without any drive or ultimate goal behind it, which becomes even more apparent at the game's conclusion. The plot works with local tension only (i.e. short-term obstacles and goals). The lack of strong characters makes it hard to build-up a bad guy and the pace at which the city changes and the threat swallows it leaves no time to make you care about it or its inhabitants. Unlike the Bastion, you didn't build it with your own two hands and, despite being in a city, you never get a chance to interact with anybody. This leaves the romance as its only redeeming factor... except it isn't either, because the main characters' interaction is very one-sided. The sad truth is: Transistor's story is forgetable.   And finally -   THE BAD  : -  WORLD DESIGN (SCOPE AND DEPTH) . While the design is great, you hardly see anything of the city (or the rest of the world). Vistas are few and far between and the game doesn't feature any maps or background information that allows you to see the 'big picture'. Sadly, this devaluates most of the ingame biographies and what lore there is because it becomes that much harder to relate to for their lack of context. -  The ENDING . It certainly isn't Mass Effect 3 levels of terrible but, frankly, it makes no sense. The game's conclusion renders pretty much the entire hero's journey pointless and I have to ask what motivation Red had in the first place. That isn't to say that it isn't beautiful in several ways but nonetheless highly disappointing if you were hoping for a well-written story. -  The LENGTH . From what I have heard from several people, 7 hours is not a good time. It is quite possible to beat the game in under 5 hours. New Game+ may add replay value here, if you truly enjoyed the combat system and don't share my gripes with it, but if you don't, it leaves the question of value for your money. And, regardless of New Game+, my impression is that the game tries to do too much in too little time - Introducing you to a world, threatening this world and making you its involuntary savior has worked before... but it doesn't work for Transistor.    MY VERDICT:   (Or: tl;dr) Transistor is a good attempt to solve a task that was almost unsolvable - To create the next 'Bastion'. Design-wise, it is every bit as strong and a true treat for the eyes and ears, with some great ideas on how to keep progression interesting and your game experience unique.  But a closer look reveals a system that tries to combine real-time and tactical combat and, as a result, is the master of neither. The beautiful world that seems so full and interesting is a facade, a mere stage decoration with too little behind it to keep it from falling over when leaned on, leaving a lot of the ingame lore without sufficient context. And while music and narration are great, they cannot hide the fact that the play itself is boring and the characters forgotten as soon as they leave the stage. Supergiant Games gave their game and its world too little time to introduce themselves and captivate you and the result is all the more disappointing for it.  Nevertheless, I recommend Transistor for the interesting experience it is; you may find the combat system and story, despite their flaws, more satisfying than I did and, either way, you do not want to miss out on the soundtrack and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice. Supergiant Games deserves the money for a brave attempt, even if this attempt falls short.  If you aren't dying to play Transistor right now, pick it up once it goes on sale.",

            "review_text": "Well, I just finished my Recursion and can now finally review the game.  The fights are basically played in an arena - a closed area on the map - and require a lot of thought in skill preparation and use as well as character placement.  Their are two ways to wage a fight. Either you go the classic active way (like any action game), or you can use the Turn() function which allows you to stop time and plan your attacks at leisure. While in Turn(), everyone freezes and a bar appears at the top of the screen, this bar represent the total of actions you can take (for those who know of it, imagine Legend of Legaia's system). Moving and attacking eats a part of the bar depending of the skill and isn't done right away, instead you plan all hte attack which will be carried out when you finish the Turn(). The actions are then done at lightning speed, often taking a number of enemies to the grave at once with good planning.  About the skills : You will equip skills (which you acquire by leveling and by finding people) at savepoint, in up to 4 active slots. Every skill is totally different from another both visually and practically. One can debuff a group of enemies in an area while the other will make you invisible for a while. Then you can equip those skills as passives for the active skills or for yourself. A skill that makes you drop explosives packets on the ground as active will increase the damage and blast radius of another as passive. Character passives can increase your total HP, reduce damage taken, reduce cost of abilities during Turn()...   The game isn't too short, but not really long. It took me 7 hours to complete my first run and 9 hours to Recurse through the story. Recursion is basically New Game+ wherre you keep everything and replay the story while the enemies are end-game level and randomized through the areas.  The scenario can seem confused, but is very enjoyable with many things to learn. Apart from the Sandbox - which give acces to a practice area and a number of tests as well as some miscellaneous stuff, a big one being the jukebox - there is no side content. The art is sublime and serves very well the game. The music nicely compliments the action and events throughout the game and is a jewel to listen to.   I give a solid 9.5/10 for this well crafted game. Really enjoyed it.",

The music is fantastic and a mix of ambient songs with five vocal tracks that call back to the plot of the game itself. “Red” is a character of unfortunate circumstances who must piece together what happened to the city she inhabits.   Combat is done in pseudo turn-based mode, or all in real time. The mechanics of combat remain very fresh due to the skill system. Each skill can be used in its own right, or slotted into another skill to serve as an enhancement to the base skill. Therein lays the dilemma, do you use this skill as a main skill or a passive skill? There are certainly rewards for changing up your build as well.  There is a sizable amount of optional content. Lore is tucked nicely in with combat skills you unlock as you progress through the game. The tutorial is there but it isn’t patronizing, in fact it’s one of the best I’ve seen in years. Controller support is in the game as well as a native support of keyboard and mouse. The controls are responsive for the most part, some skills can require a bit more precision than Red sometimes wants to give.   Transistor is easily in my top three games for 2013/2014. The whole experience is rumored to be 3-9 hours (depending upon play habits) but the retail price of $19.99 is easily far for a stunning experience.  (edit: played most of the game, but not all of it. It took ~12 hours. I am not the fastest player ever however.)",

The game lets you set the pace, with no shortage of save points, and no awful penalties when you can't keep up with the battle mechanics. I followed no guide, and pannicked when I first lost a function - but still I went on, progressing. Sure, the enemies and their upgrades are hard - but after a few rounds of losing, you'd get the hang of it. And hey, hearing His concerned voice in the background makes it well worth the hits.

Utilizing different combinations of abilities allows for a wide range of play-styles and tactics. Transistor has such a great take on gameplay mechanics that it is entirely refreshing and a lot of fun. Considering the above, the one minor drawback, to me, is how vague the world is. However, I can't really consider that a negative, because the world of Transistor and everything in it can be open to interpretation.

But the game gives you lots of time to take in the environment, learn and master the combat, and really learn about all the characters. Transistor doesn't completely match up to Bastion, but it's definitely worth playing!",

            "review_text": "Alright, first and foremost let me point out that I have recommended this game, which will contrast with what will sound like a negative review. If it comes off that way it's because I felt like Transistor could have been so much more, but standing next to Bastion it's withering in the shade. Overall it was an enjoyable experience, but at the end of the day I'm glad I got it on sale or I might have been very disappointed.  Let's start with the things I enjoyed about the game. The thing that jumps out first is that there's a lot of love behind this game. You can tell that Supergiant wanted to really connect with their audience by creating an immersive world and characters that you can sympathize with. The real-time/active-time combat tries new things while staying grounded in somewhat familiar territory for most strategy/rpg fans, and being able to 'socket' abilities into other abilities makes for some interesting emergent play-styles.  Now for the things I didn't find very enjoyable, or thought could have been done better:  First- about that immersive environment Supergiant wanted to create in Transistor. Personally, I felt like that was a total whiff. They should have called this game Esoterica, because it's filled with fluff that is never explained. It's like picking up a sci-fi book you've never read before and know nothing about- picking a random page in the middle, and reading for four hours. By the end you know more than you did at the beginning, but you're still lost for the most part.. you're missing fundamental information to make sense of the story.  As far as the characters go, I wanted to feel connected to them- I read every little bio and sought out every OVA station to learn more about the world and its inhabitants- but it feels hollow. Like they're trying too hard to live up to Bastion, which achieved greatness in both gameplay and storytelling almost effortlessly.  I found the 'narrator' in this game to be completely obnoxious. In Bastion the narrator added a lot of flavor and backstory to the world, since as a third party witness to the events that were going down, he could provide information that the player needed to feel connected to the things that were happening around them. In Transistor, he just monologues.. it's like going on a road trip with somebody who can't make meaningful conversation and doesn't like the sound of silence so they read every billboard you see. Eventually you would rather swerve into oncoming traffic than hear that there's a Cracker Barrel in 2.7 miles.  The game itself is reasonably fun, if a bit repetitive (which is kind of a strike against it in its own right... how can a game with so much personality be repetitive after only 3 hours?). The ability socketing system is a very interesting spin on the whole 'play how you want RPG' genre. It's easily exploitable for those who want an easier time with things- but for players looking for a challenge can apply handicaps that award you with additional experience at the cost of a harder game. I would have liked to see a bit more variety here, but it's clear that they were designing a 4 hour game and not a 20 hour game.  I ran into a LOT of bugs, which was disappointing considering how late to the Transistor party I am. Supergiant has had ample time to fine tune the experience- but I was running into issues where all of the AI models were missing (you could mouse over them and get tooltips, but the models were missing). A few times during combat I was teleported outside of the 'ring' and couldn't get back in, so I was locked into a combat state and couldn't end the fight- so I had to force-close and restart. And just pathing issues in general.. plenty of times I'd click on a point to run to, but Red would choose the most bizarre path to get to an unobstructed position. This happened frequently during combat turns, where the incorrect path taken would basically ruin all of the proceeding commands (attacks firing into thin air, etc). It wasn't so frequent that it was game-breaking, but it happened enough to merit mentioning.  And if you don't want any spoilers, this is probably a good spot to stop reading because I need to vent about something that happens at the very end of the game.   Still here? Okay. So one of the things I'd read about this game was that it had a 'strong female lead' and that supergiant was doing a great service to female gamers with Transistor. Now, full disclosure- I'm a dude, so it's entirely possible that I don't get it. I fully recognize that I may in fact lack the extra 'X' chromosome to understand what girl gamers are looking for in a game with a female lead. However, at the end of the game when Red chooses to off herself to be with this guy we (the player) know nothing about had my eyes rolling into the back of my head. I felt like it was a cheap romantic plug at the end of what could have been a somewhat interesting (albiet confusing) story. Here she is with the 'brush' that could remake the world- she could un♥♥♥♥ everything that the calimari or whoever destroyed. But instead she rebuilds a plaza, then sits down next to the narrator's body and stabs herself with the big blue sword. Poetic I guess? Maybe we need more context. Maybe the world isn't worth saving if they can't be together, but Supergiant gave us NOTHING on this guy. Not a name, not a backstory.. nothing. His bio card is 'Unknown' with zero information.   Anyway.. It's worth playing. It has its problems, but it did not live up to my expectations at all.",

The combat is a bit clunky when it comes to its Turn() system and the amount of time you have to run around like a headless chicken before you can fight again in and out of Turn(). As stated above, the game is short which is sad seeing that there's a beautifully crafted world layed out before you with enough lore to make the city come to life, even if you don't meet more than two or three actual people(barring the character profiles you can unlock throughout the game). Speaking of characters, the characters were alright; there wasn't enough of the game to get truely attached to any of them, which sucked at the end. Overall, I think this game is great; I can't stress that enough, even with its problems. I highly reccomend getting this game and the soundtrack on sale, and set about 5-6 hours aside for a short, but sweet story.",

New game plus lets you unlock and complete what is left, so your mileage may vary on the length of the game - I expected more bosses or, at least, more difficult encounters on the first run, even activating every 'idol' I came across. - Plot isn't told to you directly. If you are looking for a deep narrative experience, this may back you off. The way it is delivered may remind of Dark Souls to some people.  All around taking the same roots as Bastion, this game is far more polished. If you enjoyed its predecessor, you will absolutely love Transistor, even with those cons (which aren't really something considerable, more like a personal opinion).

I'd say don't get it for a narrative experience, the one it provides is good, whole and satisfying but by no means is it what I enjoyed most about the game. Players of Bastion may be slightly miffed to hear this as it was certainly the focus of Bastion, tha amalgumation of music, voice acting, art and narrative gave an almost cinematic experience in Bastion that left a lasting impression, and while all of those traits are bought into Transistor and done well, the ambiguity in the story is left for the player to explore, as a reult I found it less satisfying until you uncover as much as you need to in order to really understand the charecetes and events.  What I really enjoyed in Transistor was its gameplay, it simply gets better as the game goes on, and its for this reason I see it as a must to at least try recursion, which allows you to unlock all the skills again, making some incredibly powerfull and therfore enjoyable combinations. The game provides the right amount of challenge to force you to explore its brilliant match up system. No combos are bad and any startegy is worth a go.   Special mention to the music and vocal work, while the narrative may not be all that impactful theres certainly a strong sense of immersion created through the music and art.

The story is a masterpiece, could easily be extrapolated to become a critic of our society, the soundtrack, jesus ♥♥♥♥ing christ the soundtrack, if you played you know there aren't words to describe it. The graphics are ridiculously beautiful, scenarios are quite detailed, enemies not much but that's to be expected, won't say why since it would be a spoiler.  Okay, so, to sum it up pretty poorly, the game is about a utopian city where the people who live there can shape it however they wish, until something goes wrong. You are in charge of finding out what went wrong and why. At first i thought it would be something like, 'yeah well theres the supervillain who wanted the power all to himself' or something along those lines, as it usually is. I was wrong. Oh boy, i was.  Without further ado, let's get to numbers and proper review of the game's aspects.  Pros:  + Brilliant backstory + Amazing soundtrack + Gameplay mechanics mixes a lot of many games together, making it unique + Very well designed, looks almost like a piece of art coming to life + Has good replay value, since it has a 'new game+' like feature + You can customize your abilities to match your playstyle + You can customize the difficulty setting of the game by messing exactly with which part you want easier/harder + Very interesting way to develop character backgrounds  Cons:  - Rather short game, you can finish the main story in about 5 hours - Even if you can choose the abilities, some of them are overpowered, making them almost mandatory - Battles become a chore after certain abilities are unlocked - Price is a little high for a game so short  With about 26 hours into it, i have unlocked everything there was to unlock and got all achievements the game had. Even though the price is not ideal, it's still worth the extra effort, and if you can buy it on a good sale, the price problem is gone.  Final score: 8.6/10. If you're a fan of games with more thought provoking storylines, or like new/unexplored combat systems, this game is for you.",

The soundtrack--don't even get me started--the soundtrack is massively beautiful, adding to and improving upon the story and world of the game. The visuals are both vibrant and not distracting. And the ending...the ending is exceedingly well-done and satisfying to me as a gamer, and as someone who'd gotten invested in the characters. What really set this game apart for me was the combat system. I am usually a FPS gamer, so this was a new and intriguing experience. By customizing your chosen 'functions' you're also able to customize how you fight the enemies. In addition to that, the turn mode is REALLY interesting. It takes some getting used to, but the transition period is not overly long.  All in all, Transistor has rocketed to a spot on my list of Top 5 games.

There's also a little less story and immediate exposition given to you this time, you'll have to play around with the different skills (called Functions()) in different slots in order to get some more background and story. With that being said however, I can understand why people wouldn't like this as much as Bastion - it's definitely a different game, not just Bastion with a reskin.

The storytelling is nuanced and integrated in such as way as to directly challenge your combat abilities and encourage you to attempt new combinations of skills.

The tiny touches - such as certain in-game actions included for no reason other than to deepen characterisation - are really what make this game stand out for me.

Just moving through the bleak city with nothing but the sword just makes a person weary. The combat is fun and the mix of planning, evading, and remarkably satisfying executions really shine. The incentives to try out new attack combos was enough to get me to tinker and find some really nice combos. The music in the game are stellar and haunting since it's a reminder of your character's state. Also? There is a button that makes your character hum. That might sound silly, but I found myself pushing it between fights on a regular basis and that is awesome.  I admit that the story does feel a touch flimsy and rushed near the end. So much of the action takes place just off screen and you never quite catch it. However when That moment happens. Well. You'll be bewildered and upset and then you'll get it. I guess that was the best part of That moment. After a moment I think I'd make that choice too.  See ya in the Country.",

In addition to the top notch visuals, Transistor boasts one of the best gaming soundtracks. I find myself listening to the cd over and over while at work.   The combat is a unique blend of strategy and an action game where the player can freeze time and plan out their attack on the 'Process'. As with Bastion, there are game modifiers that make this game tougher, making the need for this planning mode essential.   I cannot praise this game enough. A run through of the story may be a brief 6 hours but it does not over stay its welcome and feels complete in almost every way.

It's beautiful in every way - sound, art, gameplay, plot, and the way they all mesh together to turn what could be a good game into a  fantastic  game.  The music is tied closely to the plot and the art brings out the ethereal and ephemeral feeling of Cloudbank in an amazingly unique way, while reinforcing the overall atmosphere and excitement of the entire game. They underscore SuperGiant's (by now) trademark way of storytelling: letting the atmosphere speak for itself, with the narration more like a tour-guide than noisy friend.   The battle system is a fun hybrid of action and turn based - you can play as purely one or the other, but utilizing both makes for an interesting blend of twitch and chess-like strategy. With plenty of skills, a staggering amount of ways to combine them, and variable difficulty - you can choose which limitations to use and how to power up enemies to make the perfect personal challenge - battles never feel like a grind, and are always exciting. Since 'function file' plot and character information is unlocked by using skills in different ways, it encourages you to constantly change up your playstyle, try everything, and keeps things interesting. Even going through the game multiple times feels fresh since both you and enemies retain your strength upon 'recursion'. The battles grow with you every time through.  However, to understand the game fully you need to play it through twice. If you love the game this is an easy plus, but requires investment. The depth of the plot doesn't really come out until right at the very end, and important details are in the ignorable function files. The ending might leave those expecting things to go a different way feeling unsatisfied, but I believe it fits the game perfectly, and suits the bittersweet inevitability hanging over the entire game.  Overall, highly recommended.   See you in the Country.",

Fast paced real time fighting, with some turn based elements. until you play it you wont understand. But there is an ability similar to Fallout 3's slowmo shooting. The gameplay is fluid, challenging and extreemely rewarding. I encountered VERY few bugs and problems throughout the game and sense an extreme amount of replayability.  As for the Story. Wow. Don't worry about trying to understand the story at first it unravels itself beautifully. There were, for me, big 'aahhhh' moments of realisation and understanding. It wants you to find out everything about the Process, which is your adversary in this game. I wont say much more about it, but it is very cleverly implemented and can be quite difficult to work it out. But theres lots of backstory and Lore for those who love to read and immerse yourself.  For me this gets: Gameplay: 8/10 fast, fluid, incredible amount of combat combinations and solutions to fights. but it seemed some were just comepletely unusable. But this is only with 2 playthroughs and still i havent used every combination.  Story: 9/10 its intriguing and really makes you want to know more.

If you're familiar with Bastion, you are likely to recognize Supergiant's atmospheric touch in this game. This game is shorter and has a less fleshed out plot. Like Bastion, mysteries are left to your imagination, unanswered. However, the brevity of this game will leave you wishing there were more mysteries to boggle over.  The combat is moderately strategic. If your mood is too specific, you might be disappointed, whether you're looking for simple combat or serious strategy. It has more of a balance between simplicity and strategy. It's fun for what it is.  Replay value is mildly elevated by the New Game+ style recursion mode.   Overall, I'd recommend this game.  Pros:  -The music and other atmospheric elements are exceptional. Supergiant sets a high standard for game atmosphere.  -The main gameplay mechanic is fun and allows for experimentation with the various function (skill/upgrade) combos.  Cons:  -As stated above, the game is shorter than I'd like (needs more plot points).",

            "review_text": "I think I came a little from Red's voice.  ....What do you mean, 'That's not natural?' Don't knock it till you try it.  No, but really. This game earns a   9.3/10   and is still one of the most audio-engaging games i've ever played to date, maybe only rivaled by Audio surf.  Words can't even describe how utterly beautiful and magnificient this game is. This game is artistically a treat to your eyes. Seriously, sometimes just take a moment to 'take it all in' This is a game meant to be a visual spectacle, and it clearly wants you to take a moment to look at it. If we really judged games by aesthetics alone, then it easily earns a solid 10/10 for it's unique 'Interactable Painting'-Esque world that just oozes style and personality like it's distance cousin: Bastion.  However, in a world where we judge a game by multiple factors, I will give it a fair review.  This easily earns a solid 10/10 for it's art style.   Gameplay can be jagged sometimes, as there's ever only three real stages of the combat:   1. Plotting your Turn() 2. Fleeing from enemies during Turn() Recovery. 3. Psuedo-Combat in realtime, in which most enemies outright dodge your attacks unless you carefully plan.   However, it's still engaging. The sheer amount of customizations done with your functions, and all the nifty and unique combinations that can be made from them is absoloutely stellar, and provides a deep 'Play how you want to play' feeling to the game.  The difficulty can be artificially tweaked by enabling 'Limiters' which power up the enemies in exchange for more EXP. It's worth it, for the most part. However by late game some of the Limiter's are fairly hard to keep up with, so be careful.  So as as such, the combat earns a 8.5/10, with a bit of room for improvement, mostly on some of the odd-looking animations that accompany Red's moves, and a lack of real in-between for the Turn() Planning period.  The Story of the game is told through the functions you find, whether they be extracted from the data of people, or enemies you defeat, reading is essential. There is a post about the story of Transistor, and it is a decent story filled with some intrigue and computer-geek jokes that some people might not catch unless they're pretty saavy in the computer sciences.  Lastly, and probably the second most important part of this game I feel, is the BGM.  Oh lordy, probably my favorite part of this game, the OST is hands down one of the most ear-pleasing experiences known to man.   It's hard to argue that this game doesn't just compell you to listen to the BGM, you grow an utter appreciation for the atmosphere it creates. The best part of the game is when you learn to simply 'Hum' with Red by holding Tab. Try it out! Once you learn how to Flourish, you also learn how to Hum.   I'd say I spent many a 20 minutes or so simply listening to red 'Hum' songs at various points. Absoloutely amazing. Earns an easy 9.5/10, only deducting .5 because you aren't given the ability to 'Hum' at the very start of the game.   With that said, I'd say the game comes out to be a pretty solid  9.3/10  with a definite 'Recommend This Game' from me.   I hope you get to enjoy it too~  ",

Very satisfying. The story, once I got into it, hooked me deep and I finished probably 90% of the story all in 1 day. Not sure I'll play through again, since the game play didn't hook me anywhere nearly as much as needing to know what was the story behind these two figures. A girl with no voice, carrying around the remains of a man who's only a voice.  And the world, it's beautiful.

(Tips: it might be a spoil but if you see a 'backdoor', always go for it, unlock each door which will unlock different songs. Then, with each different song, Red will hum in different way.)   -Story: 9/10 - When i read the review, some said they don't actually get the story. For me, i can see and can feel that the story was very good and easy to understand. But each person can feel different since the game create a new way of storytelling. Take time to listen and you will see. Still, game is quite short but i think it's fine to end like that (you will understand once you finish the game)  -Gameplay: 8/10 - The gameplay are fun. You get the chance to create many kind of play-styles. You can be a ninja (1 hit 1 kill), a trickster (run around and create trap)..... etc etc. However, i'm not quite satisfied since the game was kind of short and i would love to see more things i can do.

I enjoyed progressing through the main story and fighting the mini bosses. There was another learning curve with the interface and the different skills you needed to equip in order to progress to each new area. But it only took a few minutes to read about each one and figure out which one merged well with the other.  I learned that passives are your friend in this game, but you only have so much memory at first to equip them. You'll need to play through thie story a few times to get to max level and unlock all the achievements - which i'll do on my own time. I'm not really hardcore on having all of them.

Transistor also gives you a verry satisfying skill system. It lets you combine every skill in the game. . .Yes! Every single one.  So yeah, the gameplay is great. But do we get a good story?

You, 'Red', seek revenge. While playing the game you slowly find out what all happened before.   The whole game gets supported by a 'one of a kind' naration. The Transistor, your sword, is always holding a one sided converstation with you, Red, who has lost her voice. Making it a unike experience.  The only downside I've found is that, however the game introduces some great mecanics, It doesn't realy explane them. Leaving you somewhat in the dark and leaving you somethimes in a situation where you don't know what happens or what you are doing.

I probably spent over an hour in total sitting and listening to Red hum to the music. This is a soundtrack so good that often times I hesitated to proceed to the next area, fearing that the track would change. As well as all this, the voice acting is very appealing to listen to, and much of the plot is revealed through dialogue (or monologue, rather), which keeps things interesting and attatches more emotion to it all. I struggle to think of any aspect of this game that isn't simply exceptional. The art style is somewhat simplistic, but only in the best of ways, and catches the eye. The environments create a sense of a much larger and quite fascinating world that you want to explore and lose yourself in.

When you start the game, you don't have a main menu, instead you are put right into the game. This really took my by surprise. I think you'll understand what I mean once you launch the game.  So, lets get on with it.  The Plot: 10/10  Just like in Bastion, you are thrown right into the game without any introduction. Just a gal with a sword-like object which apparently talks. First I had no idea what was talking to me. The further you go into the story, the more is revealed, along with the backstory of Red (the main character, the musician). Soon it appears that 4 villans, the Camerata, those who basically own the city Cloudbank. Not only that, they are mostly scientists who care for the city, but made a mistake, and... well, you'll find out.  Gameplay: 9/10  Bastion had a right-left-midbutton gameplay, while here you get abilities that you use. Not only that, it is also followed with Turn() feature, a planning feature that allows you to stop time and make actions like walking and using abilities for the price of Turn() potential (lets call it that). For instance, a Breach() ability (your very first ability you have access to) uses 20 Turn(). Not only that, you get some introduction to different characters who these abilities belonged to. For example, Red's ability is Breach(), an ability that stuns the target and makes it more vulnerable for 1.6 secs. Another one was a racer, when you used the transistor to 'absorb' his essence, you retrieved an ability that allows you to blink. Furthermore, you can read info on these abilities that reveal about the character. Each ability can also be used as a passive or an upgrade to a different abilities. They can be swapped at any time when you get to an access point. And of course, remember the Shrine in Bastion? Here you have so called 'Limiters', they work exactly the same as those things in the Shrine, except they also reveal info on the 'Process' if used.  Music: 10/10 I won't comment on this. No point.  Visuals: 10/10  Seriously, the visuals are just amazing. Some may complain tho, that they don't like cyberpunk stuff, but to me, the art in this is majestic. The lights, the sketches, everything deserves a 10 in my opinion.  Duration: 7/10  Sadly, its rather short, but if you play with limiters you may get a longer enjoyment from this. That's exactly what I did with Bastion. Yet Transistor is still shorter than Bastion. I really wish it either had a continuation or just a longer gameplay. That may ruin the plot however.  Replayable? Yes, definitely. Its worth replaying. Unlike Bastion, you don't have to grind here to get levels (because you can't, lol).  Overall: I really want to give it 10/10, but I can't. I honestly just can't. I want it to be a bit longer, I want to get more enjoyment, maybe have a reality where Process comes from, where I can destroy its core, where I can have some sort of a choice like in Half-Life at the very end, or... I don't know. I just feel the urge for this to be longer.  So any way. 9/10, I can't wait for Supergiant games to release a new game. Maybe soon, maybe later, maybe next year (I actually heard they are working on a new game to be released in 2017).  TL;DR Transistor is awesome, has great music, gameplay mechanics and great plot. If you feel like you need a game that would allow you to relax and feel some enjoyment, then this is it. I am a Dota 2 player myself, and nothing relaxed me more than Bastion and Transistor (especially transistor, tbh). Go buy it.",

            "review_text": "On its own, Transistor is a solid game with a great atmosphere and world, a very complicated and interesting story, and a very unique combat system. The game features narration by Logan Cunningham, who plays a voice trapped in the Transistor, leading to a lot of real-time commentary on your actions. It's odd but the terms 'action' and 'turn based' simultaneously need to be used to describe the game. The music as well is really good, and is a prominent element to the game.  This is SuperGiant's second game, their first being Bastion (a must-play, btw). For those who HAVE played Bastion, it'll feel relatively familiar in many respects (such as how the story progresses, Jen Zee's artstyle, etc.), but still unique. Comparatively, both games featured Cunningham as a narrator, though IMO it worked a bit better for Bastion as he was more able to tell a story, almost omnipotent, rather than act as a lone character. This is probably part of why the story is a bit confusing for Transistor.  While Bastion's strong point was its narration, where Transistor really excels is its combat system. As I've said, the combat system is very unique. It's a little hard to understand at first but it is incredibly deep and challenging, with multiple setups, perks, and moves that are all balanced very well. The only weak part is the interface used to synergize the skills: it's just as deep and complex as the fighting itself. A slightly clearer interface would greatly help, but you can also overcome this by just gradually memorizing the functions of the skills for when they're applied.  Unfortunately a lot of the additional story elements are in the form of text-based profiles from traces and skills you've acquired, and while it expands the world, setting the time aside to read through the logs for each trace you acquire kinda feels tedious. That said, there's enough explained in the main storyline to understand the world as much as you need to (if you're paying attention), so the logs are more just for additional sustenance. The game also lacks some kind of central world hub: the one they have available is only available at certain times in the middle of missions, rather than a place you return to after each mission. There are some challenge modes available for additional content, and they're worth doing, though I personally am hoping SuperGiant will add in more challenge modes in the future.  The main storyline isn't too long, will take about 6-8 hours to beat, but it's very rich and fulfilling, and leaves a New Game+ option to experience more of the combat, with a few subtle changes to the story. Overall a worthy second title out of SuperGiant Games.",

            "review_text": "I just finished this game, and I'm sad to have to see it end. It was a truly fantastic game, on par if not better in its own way than Bastion.   The story interested me and held my attention throughout, especially with the way it tells itself through the narration and environment. The music and art style were absolutely beautiful as I'm sure you will hear many people say. The combat felt fresh to me, easy to get a grip on but nothing I've ever really seen before.  The only nitpicks I have with the game are:  A) The boss fights are dreadfully easy once you get a hang of the game. B) There is a certain enemy type towards the end of the game that felt really cheap to me (though that may just be because I was worse at the game than I thought). C) I'm not sure how I came under the impression, but I thought 'Recursion Mode' (New Game+) would include extra story elements or different dialogue in certain areas. After a bit of research after finishing the game, I discovered it was nearly all enemy layouts and enemy difficulty and such, much to my dismay. Though if you're into the combat, I suppose that's not really a negative. D) My game crashed. Once. In a challenge map. Before it began. After the game saved. No biggy, but something to watch out for.  Overall, absolutely amazing game that will stick with me for a while, and may very well become one of my favourite games. I whole-heartedly recommend buying it, especially if you enjoyed Bastion. Even if you didn't, buy it anyways, Supergiant deserves all of your money.  10/10 would bang, play, finish, get upset by, reason with myself so I stop getting upset by and then write a review that got way longer than I intended again.",

New mechanics like the triple functionality of the functions and Turn() are very original and well implemented, nonetheless. The map travel system from Bastion was replaced by a continuous world, and all the possible shops had their place taken by a new interface controling every customizeable aspect of your character.

Bit easy, but can be made harder by pretty dynamic difficulty levels. The storytelling is good too. It's very in media res. You are dropped in the world without as much as a start menu and left to figure out what's going on and how everything works. It's a simple enough game to pull that off. It's pretty short and fairly linear, though. Replayability value doesn't seem that great even with new game+, though I can imagine revisiting this at some point in the future.  Superior to Bastion in almost every way, except maybe Logan Cunningham isn't quite as cool as the voice here as he was as the narrator in Bastion.

But, comparisons invited need adressing: -The story is different, but not in a bad way, because it is an entirely different story: Bastion was more of a world-focused, mini-epic, and Transistor is closer to a film noir. It is more of a personal journey of the titular character Red, and the voice trapped in the Transistor. I still feel that there are some themes(especially towards the end) that seem a bit similar to Bastion, but on the whole, it is a different story. It is still great, especially if you can enjoy something nuanced.  -The combat is a bit heavy to begin with, but it is a joy to experiment with. It is built in such a way that you can employ any strategy you wish to, without making the game too easy or too hard: I often found myself using Jaunt(a dodge/dash move) as my primary damage output, and I wasn't punished for it, which is nice. I still think that whilst its preferrable to utilise the Turn() mechanic, it is entirely possible to use only the real time part of the combat. There are enough cooldown modifying abilities that you could unleash entire barrages at the enemy without having to go into Turn().  Aside from that, well the music is a bit more cyber-punk, as goes with the setting, but it did satisfy me more than Bastion's soundtrack. However, that is due to my own preferences in music. The art style is still as gorgeous as it was before, and the enemy design and variation are also pretty good.  Overall, it is definitely worth your time: it improved in Bastion in its gameplay, the story is brilliant, and everything else is of the same(if not greater) standard than the studio's previous title. It is well worth the asking price, because it is that damn good.",

(Spoiler Free)  The first thing that hits you is the world, and the art, and throughout my entire thirteen hours (on my first playthrough) the environments never get stale or old. Everything is gorgeous and feels handpainted.  The story and the characters are incredible and deeply engaging, but I won't say anything more than that all the voice actors involved are phenomenal.  Battles are fun, fluid, and tactical. The mixture between the strategy and turn-based combat and something more real-time never gets old. Bastion this is not, Transistor is more methodical, and much slower. You're allowed to take your time to plan out what you'd like to do and put it into action. The skills and abilities system keeps the variety up. Usually I'd find my niche and stick to what I liked, but Transistor had me switching up my abilities at every single checkpoint, and not just for all of the files that I was addicted to collecting to get every single tidbit I could out of the writing.  This noir wouldn't be complete without the jazzy cyberpunk soundtrack, which I could listen to forever and never get bored of. Not only is it good on it's own, but it sinks itself deep into the game and plays dynamically and reactively depending on what is happening at the moment.  But, above all else, what makes Transistor a masterpiece is the atmosphere. The absolute dedication the game has to it's world and how much it sucks you in at every opportunity. Optional environments and points of interest litter every single map just to get another line or two out of the Voice. The way the music works itself in, the way enemies interact with you and all your abilities, the way the environments twist and change, the terminals you find, the files you can read, and the small interactions and character moments out of Red herself are unlike anything I have ever played before.

            "review_text": "TL;DR: Everything is either excellent or above average. Get it.  Ok, so here's the review. I love this game, and it's one of my favorites. I'm going to do a run down of each part of the game.  POSSIBLY LIGHT SPOILERS WARNING  Overview: Like Supergiant's last game, Bastion, Transistor is an isometric hack-and slasher with a good story and narrator. Story can be a little bit pretentious, but the combat provides a solid core and everything else is either excellent or good enough that I can reccomend this.  Combat: This is what you'll be doing most of the time. While it starts off relativley simple, it gains depth as you aquire more Functions (your skills) from corpses you find. The main 'gimmick' (but it's not really a gimmick) is being able to freeze time and plan what moves you'll use. You can freeze time, jump behind an enemy, and get a backstab with a melee ability. The combat is a bit complex, but you'll get the hang of it. You (eventually) get four active Function slots, each which can be buffed with two more Functions, and on top of that you can have 2 (or possibly 4 but that's hard to do) passive Functions. The only way to get story documents about corpses which gave you functions is to use the functions as an active, equiping another skill with it, and using it as a passive. This encourages trying new things with the combat. There are also things called Limiters, which you unlock over time. Equiping one makes the game harder, and tells you about the enemy it corresponds with. Combat: 8.5/10  Story: The story is really good if you can figure out what's going on. The characters are mostly given depth through their Functions, because the only characters that talk are three of the villains and your sword. Red, the main character, is a singer who lost her voice because of the villains, which is all I can say without spoiling anything. The sword, getting to talk the most, is the most developed character, but Red is still the favorite of most fans. The story is great, but very confusing without reading some of the community's threads. It regards the cyberpunk city of Cloudbank, where the citizens democratically control what the sky looks like, what the weather is, and what buildings are constructed. (Can't say how without spoilers.) But patterns develop, and the system designed to bring novelty results in nothing changing. This leads to a terrorist orginization of Cloudbank's administrators killing off artists and the people who change the city, and eventually they release an evil called the Process on Cloudbank. The ending of the story is a gut-punch moment. Story: 8/10  Aesthetic:  While the art is great, it's nothing compared tO THE MUSIC IT'S AMAZING. (There are people who bought this game for the soundtrack and still haven't played it.) Aesthetic: 10/10  So if you're looking for a short, replayable story based (slightly pretentious) hack and slasher with the greatest soundtrack of any game ever (seriously), Transistor is the game for you.

            "review_text": "I liked this game, but it was primarily due to the combat style. It uses a combination of turn-based and real-time. The player gets to decide how to handle combat. Does the player use TB or RT? Most of the time I used turn-based. Sure, I could attempt to play it like Bastion, but playing by turn gives some added benefits.   The storyline leaves much to be desired. I found it to be full of plot holes and towards the end, it seemed rush and slapped together. Up to that point, I found it intriguing. However, it really loses the player towards the end.   Additionally, the difficulty curve of the game was a bit uneven in spots. From what I found, the player would be engaged with somewhat challenging opponents and then, suddenly, would have to take on a boss that was much, much more difficult than what the player had dealt with prior. After that point, the level of challenge never really peaked beyond the difficulty of that boss - not even the last boss.   Should you get it? Well, that depends. Did you like the music in Bastion? Do you like linear, but somewhat engaging storylines? Will the better aspects of the game (e.g. combat, music) outweigh the not-so-great?

            "review_text": "Transistor may be the classiest, most stylish and   beautiful   game I've ever played. It also seems very innovative. It's an evolution on the super-saturated acrylic painting style of Bastion (Supergiant's previous game), incorporating an intricate 1920s art deco interpretation of neon turquoise Tron glow, visually somewhat similar to Bioshock.  The sound track is an integral part of the beauty. Not at all just background noise, it's closely integrated into the context. It's smoothly haunting with the protagonist character humming soulfully along at the push of a button (strangle compelling).  This game quite closely resembles it's predecessor in many ways:   Both are top down, isometric view.     Poignant, with pretty little side-on 2D cutscenes that augment the in-play storytelling.    Tales of personal loss and societal/city devastation, picking up (or picking through) the pieces.    Disembodied voice-over narration from another character, but one who's physically present in context this time.     Mute protagonist, again an explanation is worked in here excellently.     There are unlocks that make play harder (for slightly more experience gain), as well as collecting new abilities.  But it departs from Bastion's pure, practised skill - aim and click, continuously rolling action bonanza - by injecting a kind of seamless turn planning mechanism into the real time action. This allows, and demands, far more tactical thinking in the heat of battles. It's rewarding as you can escape tight spots in style and beat heavy odds. Plus, of course, this gives plenty of time to stop, think and analyse the situation. Great for those of us who don't always quite have the mental processing speed of fighter pilots.  The abilities, known as ' functions ', form the core of the game experience. They are not only used as novel new active attacks, but also modifier upgrades to   any other   ability you have. Or, as a passive abilities that are always active. Thus there is a combinatorial explosion of possibilities as you proceed to accumulate them.  The huge, buried depth of game mechanics (that must have taken a whole lot of careful design and coding) reminds me most of Magicka's spell system. There, elements are combined in real time to be blasted out like guitar chords. But composing new Transistor skill combinations is a separate setup process done at ' Access Point ' checkpoints. I found all the descriptions a little hard to juggle mentally while shuffling between the different information screens. It's also time consuming, and a little bit more fiddly than necessary, taking me at least as long, overall, as the actual fighting. So probably too long, unless this suits your mindset somewhat, with the play flow thoroughly interrupted. The game is all about figuring out synergistic load-outs and combo strategies.  Players are incentivised to try out many combinations, since there are narrative expanding character biography snippets which are unlocked by using each new ability once (in combat) in each of the 3 types of slot. There's also opportunities to quickly test out ideas and practice, away from the main story progression, in a literal beach themed ' Sandbox ' area. So you're unlikely to stick to one favourite setup for long. It would be real shame and I'm not sure how much that would even be possible. The battles are quite varied, so will often demand quite different approaches. Enemy types are randomly varied to an extent too, on each re-try (or re-play).  Each ability embodies archetypal personality traits of a particular character and they are woven into the story ark to be picked up along the way. It's pretty clever, and really gives a sense of double meaning, that everything and everyone is a metaphor for parts of a computer system, perhaps, like (the original) Tron. Programming functions personified, or vice versa.  The plot sets out like ' Kill Bill ' (2003), but, as details are incrementally expanded via a variety of interactions, a very nuanced exploration of big societal themes is rendered, with the antagonists being sympathetic, tragic and their purpose and motivations understandable. At large, it is a reflection on the potential flaws of an absolute (participatory) democracy, even in an otherwise utopian environment. Here, the 'Process' (collective name for the robot enemies) also feels duplicitous - sounding almost like they are talking about understanding (and subverting) the politic process. Then, of course, the dangers of concentrated power - how small personal flaws might cause everything to unravel. Here, ' The Camerata ' has resonance, to me, of the Khmer Rouge, or some other revolutionary force, that accidentally caused huge losses when applying its ideology.  So there is certainly much depth to this game, on many levels, with no doubt many real world references tied in. e.g. ' Royce Bracket ' may be named for Winston W. Royce, computer scientist who coined the term 'software engineering'. ' Young Ladies ' perhaps a tip to Neal Stephenson cyberpunk novel ' The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer '...? Talk of ' The Country ', a reference to Shakespeare's line: ' The undiscovered country from whose bourn, No traveller returns '...?  I don't feel that every single plot detail comes together in a perfectly defined way. Some things are deliberately left open to interpretation more than others, but I'm sure there will have been tweaks and compromises during development, interfering slightly with narrative sense. The mapping of game mechanics onto plot, while ever clever, and more thorough than most any other title, is not perfect. For example, the new game plus 'recursion' mode doesn't seem able to have a direct, causal, logically consistent plot mapping (however much you overthink it). Regardless, Transistor definitely has a rewardingly complex, detailed story. One that will bear re-examination after first completion. Recursion is ideal for this. It also lets you carry on to pick up second copies of each ability function, for even more extreme setups. I personally reached max level just before finishing my second run, then picked up the final, challenging (10 limiters) achievement within 30 minutes of starting a second recursion. Perfectly paced for 100%-ing the Steam achievements; very satisfying.  Value wise, it yielded about 40 hours of engaging play time for me. A large part of that was spent compulsively experimenting, as I like to do in such games (if they draw me in). This can be done in the context of regular combat, by simply restarting that section, back to your last access point where you can change things up again. But it is also the main utility of the sandbox, aside from trying to beat your highest single turn total damage figure (fun!). You reach this area via 'back doors' which crop up periodically in the main game. Also in this area are a whole bunch of differently structured tests and challenges, which pretty near double up the game's content and again encourage exploring and understanding the various functions: Time trials, escalating rounds of engagements to survive with a limited function set, etc. There are a half dozen logical puzzles that particularly tickled me, showing the flexibility of the turn() system. I wish there'd just been a   few   more... :-)",

            "review_text": "Story: 5/5 The storytelling to Transistor is told through the interactions between Red, the mute singer protagonist, and her weapon possessed by her lover as well as various messages on computers you find throughout the 5-hour campaign. Plenty of blanks are left for you to fill, and the ending, although a bit confusing, is extremely open to interpretation.  Visual: 5/5 The game looks like a painting that is gradually losing its colors. At the beginning everything is colorful and brushed with bright colors but as the game progresses colors become darker and by the end there is almost no bright color. This beautiful take on artstyle really adds to the mood of the story and its themes. The city of Cloudbank is a beautiful piece of art that you will want to learn about and explore.  Sound: 5/5 The soundtrack for this game is amazing, especially the songs with lyrics. Every song felt perfectly attached to the mood of what was going on in the story at the time of whatever exploring or fighting being done at the time. The voice acting is brilliant, especially the voice of Red's lover. Sound effects for your attacks and enemy attacks fit perfectly.  Gameplay: 4/5 The combat system takes a while to get used to due to a lack of handholding, but after the learning curve it's one-of-a-kind. Abilities are obtained that can be used to experiment with various combinations of equipping some abilities to others or using them as passive effects. At death instead of returning to the last check point immediately an ability is lost until 2 checkpoints later and health is restored to max, forcing you to use the abilities you have left in new innovative ways. Time can be slowed down to make strategic decisions on what abilities to use. Limiters can be used to add challenge to the game while allowing you to level up faster.   Replayability: N/A Will edit after I replay the game on its 'new game plus' that allows replay with past unlocked abilities.  Verdict: Transistor is an experience I have never had with any other game I have ever played. You will grow to care about the main characters, Cloudbank, and its inhabitants. The presentation value is extremely high with beautiful visuals, amazing sound design, and fantastic storytelling. The gameplay has a learning curve and can take getting used to, but once it clicks it's extremely addicting. Transistor is proof that video games can be art. If Transistor is on sale, you owe it to yourself to buy it.",

Soundtrack work still excellent and capable of carrying the experience to great heights regardless of how you perceive the core experience. I appreciated the character design more in this title than their previous, if only because Red's cute as hell.

While the enemy types are good there are very few of them and they just upgrade them as the game goes along.

Let me explain the gameplay first.   You unlock 16 skills throughout the game. These 16 skills can be used as 4 primary skills, 4 passive skills, and each primary skill can get up to two skills 'supporting it' to alter or enhance the skill. Any skill obtained can be put in any of the slots, which allows for an endless array of customization. I'll try to sum up an example-- there's a dash skill. There's also a skill that pulls enemies to the user. So, I use that to support the dash skill. Enemies are now pulled to the location where I dash from. So, I summon a triggerable bomb before I dash. Enemies and the bomb are all drawn into the same location. I use another skill to detonate the bomb from a distance. Enemies drop.   There are many other combinations I haven't touched on, or even discovered. But there is a need to discover these kinds fo clever combos when the enemies get tougher-- and they do. Especially with optional limitiers enabled. These limiters increase damage enemies do, cause more to spawn, as well as a variety of other negative consequences. Never unfair, but always challenging. Think similar to those totems in Bastion.  As for the story-- it's really good. There's enough presented to you to have emotional affects on you, but there's a Dark Souls-esque deal with reading into the 'lore' of the game presented through paragraphs of information given to you from abilities, limiters, and etc. It works whether or not you read up on it, but you won't understand the full thing unless you read, most likely. The voiceacting has no flaws that I can call out, every voice-actor is superb. Especially Royce and the narrator. (Which are really half of the game's voice actors, but still.)   The music? It's good. A little subtle most times, I only found myself openly digging the music during combat during an early bossfight, otherwise the music was relatively in the background. However, the more I use limiters that cause battles to become more hectic, the more I notice intense music. Still, it could've been more prominent.   Overall, it's an amazing game. Completely worth the price. Again, I finished the game in eight hours. But there's more to do in the new game plus mode. Enemy spawn locations and patterns are random, there's new elements to the story, and so on.   It's a great game overall, and I see myself putting much more time into it.",

Story: While there are a few potholes in the story, that is just a minor flaw in the overall plot. 8/10  Gameplay: The gameplay mechanics are fairly simple and take little to no time to learn. This game will make you feel like you're a pro and can do anything, it's that easy. 8/10  Musical Score: This right here is probably my highest reason for loving this game so much. The music in here is simply amazing. Ashley once again lends her beautiful, angelic voice to create another musical masterpiece. TEN OUT OF TEN  Graphics: The trailer pretty much shows all there is to see, the graphics in here are amazing and certain scenes give a painterly feel. During regular gameplay, everything is very colourful, super saturated, and it overall has that indie Supergiant feel to it. 8/10  Overall this game is amazing, easily one of my favourites, you'll want to replay just to experience all it's heart-wrenching feels again, and I will love and defend it till the day I die. Now stop reading this review and just buy it already.",

            "review_text": "First I would just like to say DID enjoy this game, and it has many positive aspects that I would like to point out. Transistor, first off, is wonderfully sculpted with beautiful art and music, and mechanics that are easy to handle. Most of the game was surrounded in mystery, and you learn more about the characters as you go along.   The game focuses on fighting enemies to try and reach the next part of an area. It has many of the same mechanics as The Bastion, another game by Supergiant, featuring a birds eye view with a similar landscape layout.  I especially love the fighting sequence which is something that I've never seen before in a game, whereas you can pause the battle plan out your moves which are then executed after you are ready. You have several attacks you can use, which take different ammounts of your energy during planning depending on how powerful it is.   Though this way of battle has its merits, it is a bit too powerful and players will most likely become quickly dependant on it. When the player is deprived of it, they are usually exceptionally weak and fall quickly. However, once you have a lot of powerful skills, by the time you are in a situation that you are momentarily no longer able to plan, the enemies are down to small numbers and are quickly defeated.   This game is actually a little too dependant on this kind of battle. Once players are deprived of planning, they are most likely to resort to running away and using repetitive attacks until their planning abillity returns.  One bad aspect is that the storyline is a bit challenging to decipher. Sure, there are guides on Steam to the plot, but it is hard to enjoy the game if you cannot understand the plot while playing it. The game is pretty linear anyway, and the plot is very unnecessary to the game as you would end up going the same way because there is simply no other way to go. The storyline becomes obsolete and players will most likely find it uninteresting as it contributes very little to the actual gameplay.  All in all I would say Transistor is a good concept of a game, but it was quite short and players will basically only care about getting to the end of the stage, rather than the story. I would like to see games with these sort of mechanics in the future though, such as the battle format and the design. If another game was made like this, but with a more complicated and longer plot, and a little more insentive to get to the end of the stage rather than to just get there, it would be worthy of a more positive review. I finished this game in two days, and am only slightly impressed by reasons I have already discussed. So if you are reading this review, try the game out for yourself to see if it is actually meritable. I assume it's probably a different experience for everybody.",

I'm only a little over an hour into the game, but I just want to say that Supergiant Games has really stepped up their game (hoho) with Transistor.   Yet again featuring Logan Cunningham as the narrator of sorts, Transistor exists in its own different universe. The aesthetic appeal of the game will grab you instantly, with hand-painted graphics, fantastic visual effects, and wonderful soundtrack. So many little unnecessary but definitely appreciated features have been put into the game as well, giving it an extra layer of polish.  The gameplay is its own beast, and it has been done exceedingly well, allowing the player to shift between realtime fighting and strategic combat at the whim of the player. It feels completely different from Bastion, regardless of the fact that the two games have similar presentation and graphical style.  There are some bugs right now (some of which are game breaking for certain setups), but these will surely be fixed within the next few hours or days. I'll update my review when I'm finshed.",

As I only played into it for such a short while, I can't really commment on the rest of the game but for the chunk I played, the story was next to non-existent beyond the vague premiss that your character is effectively a program/hottie redheaded singer residing in some kind of undefined cyberworld. The game doesn't make an effort to give you any context or try to engage and invest you into the story or characters. The only real character seems to be the brooding low voiced sword that tries to fill the uncomfortable silence that this game is with sentimental sounding monologue that is effectively meaningless. This game is a like a dish you would order at a fancy French restaurant that charges you lots of money and makes you where a jacket and nice shoes: the dish is huge, the garnishing on the side is a feast for the eyes to look at it but when get to the eating part of that dish, the food is just this little ball of something forgettable in the center.",

Even the small details add a lot to the mood, like the fact that Red's humming is in sync with the background music that is playing on the area you're in.  Game mechanics seem pretty solid, combat is fast and fun, and the way the skills work is really nice. So far enemies were quite varied, and you need different approaches to each one of them (at least if you're using the limiters that are avaiable to increase difficulty).  My only complaint is that, at least so far, the game is too linear. There are some objects to interact outside of the main path, but the game didn't offer me different choices so far.   Besides the linearity, the game is pretty damn fun and beautiful. I'm enjoying the experience a lot. Definetly worth the buy.",

I actually waited a long time before writing a review because I am literally just so confused by this game that I don't even know how to review it. I am 36, and maybe I'm just getting to that age now where my mind can't keep up with newer game designs or something. I don't know. I try to be open-minded.

However if you have never played Bastion, or for whatever reason didn't like it, then this is NOT the game for you.   I expected a lot from this game, being from the same maker from Bastion, and for the most part I wasn't let down. The one problem with this game is the combat, which almost ruins this game entirely.  Combat is completely based on abilities you use. You gain various abilities as you progress, but there are no basic attacks. Meaning the combat revolves around these abilities or 'Functions' as the game calls them. With the new combat system known as 'Turn' players can stop time and maneuver the around the fight planning what moves to make. I would relate it to V.A.T.S in the Fallout games, but much more in depth. Each move comsumes a part of your 'Turn bar'. When the bar is empty you can no longer make a move. In theory this is a great idea for a game and I was all for it in the beginning. The problem with Turn however is that a function like this should be up to the players choice in games, but with the amount of damage enemies do and the time it takes for you to cast a single ability, it is almost impossible to finish a fight sequence without relying completely on it. Now one would think you could solve this problem by just turning down the diffuculty. Unfortunately you the difficulty is set, and cannot be changed. To make matters worse once you have used turn it goes on cooldown (based on how much of the turn bar you consumed), making all of your ability unusable until turn is usable again. There is an ability in the game that can be used during turn's cooldown, and it can be applied to other abilities as well, but once again with the long cast animations and the amount of damage enemies do, it is much wiser to simply run away and wait for Turn to come off cooldown. This makes the game have very little veriety since you have to rely completely on a single function. Turn should be giving the player a viable option to change the flow of combat and not completely dictate it.  However the ONLY problem I have with Transistor is the combat. The rest of the game is absolutely fantastic. The soundtrack is absolutely beautiful, the visuals are just stunning, the story is a little hard to follow but is interesting nonetheless, and the narration is even better than before. All of these combined are enough for me to look past the problems with the combat and continue playing.  I was expecting a game that would rival Bastion. What i got was a game that can never hope to come near Bastion's level. In the end it didnt meet expectations, but is still an acceptable game.",

This game plays like Bastion, with a story that isn't as good and gameplay that's significantly improved. I'd recommend playing Bastion first, it's still a great game.  Like Bastion, this game is narrated almost entirely by Logan Cunningham, who still does a great job, though his character in this game is like, 80% less salty than his character in Bastion, and that isn't nearly as much fun. I figure that Supergiant Games has maybe one more game plot that they can carry entirely on the strength of his narration before this particular gimmick gets old. It is, for now, still pretty enjoyable.  The gameplay, like Bastion, is still solidly action-RPG, but this game improves on it in two ways: There's now a fast planned-movement mode akin to Fallout's VATS (even if you hate VATS, trust me, it works here), and now every weapon you get is one you can use, even if not directly. Each weapon (function, in this game's parlance) can be equipped as a selectable weapon, or equipped to modify another weapon, or equipped to modify your character.  The plot is basically Tron meets Bastion. In the BAROQUE COMPUTER FUTURE there's this virus-like enemy that's causing the destruction of the one city that represents the world, and so everyone goes missing. Also there's a conspiracy.  I bought this on sale. I don't know if I'd pay $20 for it, but $15 or $10 is plenty solid. Certainly, you should BUY IT at whatever price ends up being good for you. But play Bastion first.",

You probably wont know it first but the 'take away' abilities every-time you finish a battle gets really annoying (we are talking about reconfiguring your powerups almost after every single battle -- who thought that was a good game design idea i dont know). When 'men' enemies are introduced there is a ridiculous spike in difficulty (we are taking easy breezy to what the hell this actually is rock hard). But the first couple of hours the game were most excellent. Now the big question is should you actually play this game for more then 2 hours because after the first boss, the game kind of goes downhill...

            "review_text": "I decided I would write a review specifically about Transistor's similarities to Bastion and what it does better and worse.  Combat: Both games feature incredibly customizable combat. Bastion has around 10 different weapon, which can all be upgraded, and you can have two with you at a time for combos such as all melee, all range, mix, all fast, all slow, etc etc. Transistor gives you four slots for attacks, starting you off with a weak fast attack, a slow strong attack, a dash, and area of effect. However, it quickly becomes more than that. The amount of combat customization is staggering, you get a hefty amount of moves. BUT then very single move can be used as one of up to four passive abilities AND can be used to modify your current active moves. The customization takes it a step up above Bastions already impressive amount.  As far as the systems go. Bastion was very much action oriented, The Kid has a dedicated Roll and Block button and the combat is that of an action game. However, it's much harder to draw similarities to transistors gameplay. It's much more tactical, you have the ability to go into a 'planning' mode where time stops, and you can take as long as you want to choreograph a set of actions for the protagonist, Red, which she will then execute very quickly while the enemies must sit there and take it. After planning mode is finished and your moves executed, the meter must recharge before Red can do this again, leaving her vulnerable. She has no dedicated block or dodge, anything resembling these abilities must be achieved through the loadout you pick, leaving her vulnerable and her only option to find cover behind the protruding blocks on the ground, which can be destroyed by either you or enemy fire (they will regenerate.) However, while planning mode leaves you vulnerable, the ability to quickly execute moves makes it a must, activating abilities in real time alone isn't going to cut it. It's tough to get the hang of it, but once you find a build that works for you, and get a full grasp on how to best utilize the mechanics, that combat can be incredibly fun. Some may prefer the action combat of Bastion, some may prefer Transistors strategic approach, this will come down to personal tastes, however, Transistors combat mechanics are structurally in-depth and interesting, if they click with you I believe you will have loads of fun.   Death in Bastion also has less long term affects. You run out of potions? Back to The Bastion with you. Transistor is interesting because what happens is when you run out of health your active more that uses the most power breaks, and remains broken for two savepoints. This is quite a bit more interesting as the penalty for running out of health is that you have to temporarily change up your strategy. Which is quite a bit more interesting than a game over. I do not know what happens once all four of your powers are gone. I assume once that happens you do experience a game over situation.  Enemy variety is a bit down from Bastion. However the actually variety in function of the enemies is up. This is likely because of the more tactical aspect of the game. The enemies can come together in a perfect harmony that will make you really need to think about how you are going to approach a situation, and they can really keep the pressure on. Another thing worth noting is the enemies level up with you, so as you progress enemies you've been seeing since your first encounter in the game will continue to stay as threatening as ever.   Fans of Bastion also might remember praying to the gods to impose more challenge on the game in return for rewards. This happens as well in Transistor, however, it is mandatory. Occasionally when you level up, you are essentially given a choice as to how the game will get harder for you, with each option also having a corresponding reward. This system is very cool, however this does mean you cannot pile all of these challenges on at will like you can in Bastion, which some may not like. Overall though there almost two different uses of a similar system. Bastion is essentially turning on hardcore mode within the worlds lore for some rewards. Where Transistor is essentially saying 'Ok, the game is gonna get harder now, but you get a choice in how that happens.' Another nice thing is the rewards are all just unlock slots for your customizable build, and the none of the challenges are expressly harder so which choice is the most desrable all comes down to you. Causing you run into interesting situation where there slot you want might make the game harder in a way you find especially difficult.  Overall, the combat's level of customization is staggering, from a technical standpoint Transistor is quite a bit more in-depth.  The hub world: This is probably the only area where Transistor falls flat. They decided to include a hub world. In Bastion, The Bastion is where you deal with a lot of your upgrades, as well as getting little tidbits of the worlds lore, and selecting which level you would like to go to (including challenge levels). In Transistor all of those things, including the lore tidbits, are dealt with via leveling up, and the terminals you run into throughout the game which also work as save points (there is no level system). From a gameplay standpoint, the only reason this hub exists is for the challenge courses. You also cannot visit it whenever you'd like, doors to this, as I recall, unnamed place appear throughout your game, you will not know when. Because of this going there essentially becomes a pain. Where as in Bastion it just happened. Making any of the content there less appealing. I would rather have accesed the challenge courses from the terminal I access everything else in. There is also seemingly some things to do, a hammock to lie in, a ball to bounce, I ended up with a tamed version of one of the enemies. But I don't really know for certain because by half way through the game I stopped even going in when I saw a door open for it. Short and simple, it was a neat little area, it didn't need to exist, or it should have been easier to access. However, this is the only time where the design of the game feels anything short of well thought out and smart. The game would have lasted longer for me if it wasn't a chore to get to the bonus content. This also brings me to my next point.  Game length: I beat the game at around 3.8-3.9 hours of playtime, a bit under what seems to be the average of 5. Don't get me wrong, it was a damn good 3.8 hours I don't regret. But there was easily the possibility for two other bosses, two at the least maybe even three, that would not have detracted from the experience if they existed the game even sort of lead me to believe I would encounter. Bastion's playtime was also longer because it invited me to experience it's extra content, whereas Transistor made me go out of my way to find it. Which is why I ended up skipping it largely.  Artistic design stuff: This is largely subjective so I'll be brief and just mention some changes people might want to be aware of.  The voice of Rucks, Logan Cunningham, returns. This had me worried that Transistor would be 'Bastion but different' but he is not a narrator this time, and he is actually using a (somewhat) different voice. His role feels different enough from his role as Rucks that the game doesn't feel like 'Bastion but this time x is different'. Some may also find him less 'intrusive' this time although I doubt anyone who liked the amount he appeared in Bastion will find him particularly 'absent' comparatively. Artstyle is kinda similar but different enough, it's nice seeing a cohesive world in this style and I'm sure plenty of people will be glad to find you cannot fall off the edge of the world this time. Music is just as good I'm running out of space theres a button to sing to your sword it's great games great I highly reccomend it.",

            "review_text": "Transistor is the second game of Supergiant Games, a small independent developer known for Bastion. Transistor follows in its footsteps with its gorgeous visuals and beautiful music, which is again matched to the story of the game. The story is based around Red, a singer who lost her voice, and the Transistor, some sort of high-tech cyberpunk sword which also can talk. Its used as primary weapon and can also “absorb” the essence of deceased persons, which unlocks new abilities, here called functions. They can be used in four active slots, as modifiers or in up to four passive slots. Every function can be used in any type of slot with varying effects, using them in different slots unlocks new lore to read about the persons symbolized by the function. Experimentation is key, as the game does not hold your hand but encourages to change the skill set around to find effect combinations. Combat can be done in real-time and with a pause mode, called turn(). In turn(), skills can be chained together and are then executed in super speed. But the game does progress, even slightly, which sometimes can the damage predictions shown in turn() render moot. The system takes some getting used to, but ones mastered is very effective and unique, although some say it is similar to the combat used in the Fallout series, which I haven't played (yet). The story is again a part of the game. It takes place in the city of Cloudbank, which has a very unique art deco cyberpunk setting, where an AI only know as “the process” has gotten out of control. The Transistor is a key component in battling it, but I'm not giving away anything more. Logan Cunningham is back, this time as the voice of the Transistor with is signature cowboy-style voice. But this time more characters speak (except for the Protagonist) which have equally unique, but very skilled and fitting voice actors. The game is a very unique experience, the visuals and music alone make it a masterpiece, not even considering the well crafted story. Compared to Bastion, it adds a combat system that needs some getting used to, but is very rewarding.  Also: If you got friends/family/etc. that don't think games can be art, show them Transistor. If this game does not convince them, probably nothing will.",

Once you learn how certain enemies work and their various abilities, it's not hard to scamper to safety. (Jaunt will save your life more than once, I will tell you that much.)  Plot is a bit shallow, sure. But honestly? It's not that shallow if you look more into it. It's basically about a group called the Camerata, their main goal is to keep control over the city of Cloudbank. They create pretty much a brush to make Cloudbank their canvas, the Transistor. With it, they begin taking out various people and testing out it's capabilities. One of their targets, a singer named Red was to be attacked but an unnamed person (Which, we can assume was Red's lover if you watch the credits roll.) defends her and is transferred into the Transistor himself. Now the two must stop the Camerata and the Process from destroying Cloudbank.  I'll admit, the game is not everyone's cup of tea or whatever beverage you might like. No problems here, but please give this game a chance. Supergiant deserves so much praise for their great work and future endeavors.",

Even if I cannot convince you that you should not buy this game, at least this review may lower your expectations in a good way.  First off, I must concede that the art is lovely and I enjoyed the music in the game. Everything else was problematic.  Obtuse  The plot moves very slowly, keeping the mystery until pretty much at the end, but the final reveal does not explain or justify the events of the game.  The in-game UI is overwhelming when you first get to use it. The attack and moding system is not obvious, and the UI does nothing to help explain how abilities works or how to configure them. Even worse, they use a lot of contemporary computer terms but with different meanings, so their terminology can be disorienting. There are a couple of times early in the game that force the UI open and require you to fiddle with stuff before you can continue, but they don't explain what you have to do.  I need to explain a core combat feature before my critique will make sense. The main character has two modes of fighting: real-time and pre-planned. In the real-time combat, your character is at an extreme disadvantage. Enemies move faster than you, have greater reach than you, and they definitely overwhelm you with numbers. Most of your attacks have a short range. In the pre-planned combat system, you pause the action and plan out one or a series of attacks. After the plan is activated, it is carried out automatically in real-time, but your character moves much faster to let you accomplish things that you couldn't in real-time. Also, all of your attacks do more damage in pre-planned combat and/or activate new combined effects.  Pre-planned combat is clearly superior to real-time, so the game limits it. Each action or movement in the pre-planned system uses up resources on a special meter that refills over time when you are back to the real-time. If you don't have enough of the special meter, then you cannot pause time or use the pre-planned combat. This is where you get into trouble.  Planning combat attacks when combat is paused gives you feedback about how much damage each attack will do and whether it will be enough to eliminate an enemy, yet it is often wrong. Enemies that choose to teleport themselves after being hit, bounce a random direction, or activate a defense are not reflected in the combat planning phase, so it is very easy to commit yourself to a big attack that uses up all of your special meter (leaving you defenseless for a period of time) which would have been OK if the enemies that you had planned to be defeated were defeated, but instead you end up dangerously close to enemies who punish you for believing the UI feedback.  Trolling  One of the main features of the game is a large selection of acquired abilities that can be used as either attacks or as modifiers for other attacks. A big part of the user experience is mixing and matching of these abilities to find combinations you enjoy.  When fighting, if your health bar goes down to 0, instead of ending the fight, the game randomly removes one of your abilities and resets your health bar. If it goes down to 0 again, then you lose another ability, and so on until you lose your last ability and are forced to reset the fight from the beginning with all of your abilities restored.  If you survive a fight with abilities lost, then they stay lost until you can explore your way to the next single-use restore terminal. The game is extremely linear, so usually you can't backtrack and use a previously-skipped restore terminal. It may require you to limp along with fewer (or less preferable) abilities for several fights before you can get your abilities back.  At first, I thought this was an innovative way to force you to mix and match your abilities after fights, but very quickly I realized that this is just the game devs trolling you. Although every ability can be either an attack or a modifier to an attack, I found that many of them were useful only in a carefully balanced loadout of attacks and mods. The removal of a single random ability often cripples an entire loadout, and after combat there may not be a way to rearrange the remaining abilities into a useful combination.  The better option in most fights where you lose even a single ability is to let the game completely kill you. If you lose all of your abilities, then the fight resets to your previous state. So you either finish a fight with abilities missing and hate your new restrictions, or you just stand still and let the enemies hit you over and over again until you can restart the fight fresh. Neither option is fun.  An alternative would be to never allow yourself to lose an ability in the first place, but the game loves to give new enemies traits that you have never seen before and old enemies traits that they didn't have before, so I found myself constantly confused why my attacks didn't work and how enemies were doing things I had never seen before. These changes are made without any feedback or forewarning, resulting in lots of cheap deaths (or ability loss in this case). Variety is a good thing, but in a game where your character is so vulnerable unless you use your limited, time-stopping special ability, it is critical that you can accurately plan your attacks, and yet the planning system is inaccurate and intentionally hides information to misguide you.  Another way that I was tricked into overcommitting myself was when the game started adding multiple health bars to bosses. Normal enemies only have a single health bar, so after hours of re-enforcing that system, the game started adding multiple health bars to certain bosses. There's no tell that I could discover to know how many health bars an enemy has. This led me to commit all of my special meter into an attack that the planning system told me would defeat them, but instead left me standing right next to the very-much-not-defeated boss and unable to do anything for a period of time (long enough for me to lose another ability from the barrage of boss attacks).  Poor Pacing  I already mentioned the bad plot pacing above, but there are other pacing issues with the game.  This game has a narrator, like in the developer's previous game, Bastion. In Bastion, the narrator comments on what the main character does in present tense. It was a fresh idea, and got lots of praise. The developers must have felt that their next game needed to have a narrator too, but they really didn't know what to do with him.  In Transistor, the narrator really has nothing useful to say. The narrator doesn't comment on what's going on, but rather fills in a little history. If any of that history was entertaining, then it might have been worth having, but I did not enjoy it. The devs even created multiple, un-skippable sequences that show the main character riding a motorcycle for long periods of time with no gameplay just so that they could have a situation where the narrator could talk, and yet he had nothing interesting to say.  There are puzzles in the game, which could have been a great way to change the pace from the extremely linear exploration and frequent combat, but there were not enough of them to help the pacing much, and the mechanics of the puzzles blended into the environment art so well that I found them more confusing than anything else.  Buggy  At least a couple of times I got my character stuck outside the playable space and had to reload the game.  Conclusion  Great art and music. Everything else is a mess.",

The story feels like it should have been two or three times longer than it was.   There's a new game plus type mode enabling you to start with all the stuff you had at the end of the first play through, but unless you stack on limitations (which give you more XP in return for increased difficulty) it's a cakewalk, even though the enemy is much more powerful. And, of course, NGP mode doesn't really replace having a long first game, especially for those of us who aren't really interested in replays...

I just felt it to be overhyped, overpriced, overrated, and, in the end, disappointing.  It's pretty obvious to me that the producers tried to transfer the features that made Bastion great to Transistor, but they couldn't also transfer the feeling of novelty and originality that Bastion had, or its heart and immersiveness.   They used that narrator again, but while in Bastion the narrator was inspiring and emphatetic, the Transistor's narrator feels rather shallow and soulless. It often says the most, utterly useless things and feels cold and superficial. They tried to maintain the same story-unravelling-as-you-play approach, but while this approach made Bastion captivating and more interesting, it only manages to make Transistor confusing and unengaging. I played for 4 hours and got undeniably bored, hoping almost desperately for something special to happen and trying to lie myself into thinking it's worth keeping on playing. They tried to make the main character (Red) as mysterious as Bastion's kid, but it end up just being lackluster. And so on....  It's hard not to compare Bastion to Transistor, they even have the same difficulty level system and similar 'challenges zone' systems, but Transistor just ends up feeling empty by comparison to me.  The combat system is quite interesting when it comes to skill assignments, but the enemies are neither truly challenging nor offering enough variety. So... back to zero.  The only good thing about this game remains the music / soundtrack. Well, guess what, you'll hardly hear that throughout the game...  My conclusion: Bastion remains 'the one'. Transistor lacks too many and it's simply dull.",

            "review_text": "As a game studio, when your first game is something as good as Bastion, it's a tough act to follow. And as a player, it's also tough to not constantly compare the two games, even if Transistor is not a sequel to Bastion. Unfortunately, that comparison only highlights the weaknesses of Transistor, which might be a decent game, but is severely below Bastion.  The greatest part of Transistor is the story. I think the game shouldn't have started 'in media res', because it makes for a confusing beginning, but once you start to get all the pieces of the puzzle, it all makes sense and paints an interesting picture. The world of Cloudbank is only hinted at, but it's an interesting, original world with interesting characters.  However, it's a bit of a shame we mostly learn about theses people and that world through archive files, and that we have to go through a completely empty environment. For story-reasons that i will not spoil, the world of Transistor is empty. You will almost never encounter any life, only enemies. Bastion's world was a post-apocalyptic world, and yet, it was teeming with traces of past life, and also new forms of life. It was also very varied, with each level having it's own distinct feel and color scheme. In Transistor, every environment is a flat expense in the middle of the city, and all the levels look the same. Moreover though there are reasons that it's deserted, it's weird that you find absolutely no traces of previous life, or even a lone survivor to talk to.  The fact that you won't meet anyone also creates another problem : the only 'person' that your character, Red, meets, is her sword. At the beginning of the game, you grab the sword that was used to kill someone...and that someone has been absorbed by the sword, and is able to talk to you. I will not spoil who that person is, but he is gonna help Red survives her ordeal. However, Red lost her voice, and thus, the sword is the only one able to talk...and boy, he does talk a lot. The only voice you hear, offering advices, opinions, etc. He is supposed to be a friend, but since he is the only one talking constantly, and giving you advices constantly, it soon feels like he is just bossing you around. 'Go there, do that, etc.'. An endless monologue, that is supposed to both guide the players, and help Red, and tell the story of the world...by being all that it just fails at everything, after a while that voice gets way too irksome, and you just want him to shut up.  But enough with the atmosphere, and let's talk about the gameplay. Supergiant Games have created an original combat system. The game plays in real time, with an isometric view like Bastion offered. However, at any point, you have the possibility of stopping time. When you do it, it starts a 'turn', with a tactical UI. Here you can plan your next actions as much as you want. Experiment with movements, attacks, and see the results. The only limit is the 'turn bar', which depletes with each move or attack. Once you're satisfied with your plan, you go out of the tactical view, and all your actions executes as you wanted, while the rest of the game is almost stopped (it's not a total pause, but it's very close to). This gives you a tremendous advantage against your opponents, who only works in real time. However, once your action are done, you're not able to use turn until your 'turn bar' is filled up again (which takes about 5s if you used all of it). Also, most of your attacks are disabled while the turn bar is filling up, which makes you very vulnerable. That makes for a different flow of combat that we're used and it's interesting to try it.  This turns system is greatly enhanced by the 'function' system of your sword. Your sword isn't a classic weapon. It has 'functions', which you gain every time you level up. Most of them are for damage (such as Breach() which throws an arrow piercing enemies) but a few are purely for support like 'convert an enemy to your side' or 'weaken an enemy'. You can only have 4 functions active at a time, but you can upgrade one function with up to two others, which will greatly change their effect. For example, you can have a function that damage and weaken an enemy at the same time and also makes you invisible for a few seconds. You can also equip up to 4 functions as global upgrades, which mean you're able to use up to 16 functions at the same time (4 attacks, upgraded with 2 functions each, and 4 global upgrades). On the whole, that function system is a great idea, because it allows you to customize your playstyle as you sit fit, and enhances the planning aspect of the game.  So, a new tactical turn system + a very customizable attack system should make for great combat, right ? Well, it should, if the enemies were up to par. Unfortunately, that's where it completely falls apart. At the beginning of the game it feels like there are many enemies, each with their own role and way to screw you. However, the more you progress in the game, the more you will understand that they have the same strengths and weaknesses. Which mean that once you've found a function combo that works well, there is little incentive to switch to something else. The more levels and functions you gain, the more refined your ultimate combo will be, and the less incentive you will have to switch things up.  If you're a tactical-minded player, it shouldn't be hard for you to find a great combo, and then spam it over and over again. There is none of the complexity of others tactical games, such as Tactical RPGs or western turn-based games. This is even more visible during the NewGame+, where enemies are totally unable to provide a challenge to your levelled up character. NewGame+ even randomizes the enemies, meaning they are even less tactically organized than they used to. Not that you care...every enemy is the same, a fodder for your unique combo.  The game actually disincentive to try to switch things up. Bastion offered 10 idols that added 10 optional handicaps with greater rewards, to make it harder and more interesting for players who like being challenged. It really tasked you to get the most ouf of your weapons and really becomes better at the game. Transistor has a similar system, the 'Limiters', but it fails to be as interesting as the idols. In truth, most of theses limiters are barely noticeable. I've been playing my NewGame+ with all 10 limiters, and barely feels the effect of them because I'm cruising through with my unique combo. However, one of them actually penalizes you for switching your functions in and out, which mean that if you have a combo that works, it's better to keep using it, than try playing with the function system.  So the conclusion is unavoidable: When you're spamming the same combo over and over again, against enemies that feel the same, that can have only one issue : boredom. And that's definitely how i felt. There were a lot of times when i was playing and then after a while i was thinking 'i don't want to keep at it', and just stopped playing. I forced myself to go through the game to be able to see the end of the wonderful story. And then i forced myself through NewGame+ to be sure i wasn't missing anything, and unfortunately, the more i played, the more i noticed the game's weaknesses.   A great story with interesting characters can't save all by themselves a weak gameplay, especially since the irksome companion also fails to be as compelling as Bastion's narrator was.",

Tranisitor certainly hits many of boxes for the hipster indie gamer you never knew you had in you, such as its thoughful sci-fi noir setting, dazzlingly well-done 2D graphics and, just like Bastion, a great musical score which ties in well with its narrative themes. But the game that it is all wrapped around? Meh, what a boring game it is. Run down this corridor into this square and fight something. Rinse and repeat (might as well be playing Final Fantasy 13 -ooooooooooooooooooooooooh I went there!). Yes it tries to pull the same narration effect that Bastion did, but even that couldn't temp me to spend more time running down corridors and fighting in so so combat.   Ah, yes, the much talked about comabt system in transitor. Fighting is really quite innovative, with a sort of hybrid system of realtime and turn-based RPG mechanics. Its cool for half an hour, but its gets old really quickly as the same winning tactic (dodge-smash-smash-dodge into cover) works for every fight, and it doesn't present much of a challange. This low level of challange yet having damage-sponge enemies and the fact that every boss seems to come back to life at least twice before it finally dies doesn't entice me to play further. All in all Transitor is probably the most overrated game i've played in many years.  This was a big shock, esp with Bastion being one of my favourite 2d games ever, but Transistor seems to me like a classic case of style over substance.",

Without music and narrator I thought I would enjoy gameplay and cool art. But gameplay was only okay.  Most of the spells (that are called functions() in this game, did I say it's pretentious?) have very long cast animation, so your only option is to use pause system. At first this idea felt interesting (since I like turn-based games) but quickly I realized how boring it implementation is.  Functions modification is an interesting idea, but UI for this might be much better I think.  Obviously, the game has it's strong points: it looks good, easy to pick up, very polished and have good controller support. But being so pretentious it just wasn't fun for me.",

I tried waiting for 15 minutes but nothing happens. This is the first game that I ever had on steam that doesn't work.  OS X 10.9.5 Late 2012 Mac mini  I will change my review once you guys fix this.  *EDIT* Ok without doing anything but I just kept on force closing and restarting the game; I was able to make it run. It took me 3 or 4 restarts, and while stuck I waited 2 to 15 minutes. Now, I never got stuck again even after restarting multiple times.   My music and controls review for this game: Music 9/10  One of the best audio experience I've had in gaming. I think the sword's voice was good for it's character, but it was not good to be a narrator. Controls: 2/10  I will compare this to Bastion, you guys broke your own controls. The character movement is too slow for the map area. Look at Bastion, you have these tiny 'islands' to move around which is good for the character's movement speed. Even then, I constantly had to do the duck and roll move just to quickly go from one place to another. For Transistor, the dash skill's reload time is too long and too short distanced to be helpful in the beginning.  And also, I didn't like the fact that I am forced to used the space skill (whatever it was called), just to beat a boss or fight enemies.  1. It takes too long to setup,  2. the action in the end where she does all the moves is too slow for me,  3. and it also destroys your momentum for the fights. This move is probably just good for puzzle solving.  4. Its also stressful to see that after all that setup time, and action time, sometimes the enemies will still be alive,  5. and because of the 'recharge phase' after the space move, that prevents me from attacking, I had to run around helplessly while being hit by the enemy weapons because it's nearly impossible to doge anything. Recharging takes 3 or 5 seconds, enough time to take half of my hp away. Single skills without the use of the space skill, takes too long to execute, takes too long to reload, and too weak to be worth doing.  I'm now at the part where you can do the speed test. And so far the controls is just too awful for me to continue. But, I will be fair. I will try a few more levels and hope that the controls will improve.  I will edit this again tomorrow for my final verdict.  *EDIT* Ok I have given all I can for this game. I'm sorry but the controls and combat style is really not for me. Everything is too slow. I'm too stressed out to continue playing. And to all who says 'If you like Bastion you should play this game', you should be ashamed.",

What the heck is the Transistor for, and why is it talking to me? The game play is only about 5 hours for a first play through which is sadly short for this type of game. The fighting while engaging is mostly trivial but can be made more difficult with the limiters but you get almost no motivation to use them unlike in Bastion. I was all excited when I baught Transistor because of the pretty good Metascore it has but I am now convinced that it is either fraudlent or made by people that played only the first ten minuets of the game. The only other upside was that it was only 20$; I guess if you only pay for two fiths of a game you shouldn't expect to get any more than that.",

            "review_text": "Having loved Bastion, i so wanted to like this... but i can't. There's no charm whatsoever, and the story is indecipherably delivered in an absurdly non-user friendly system. The character voice accompanying you is as flavorful and soulful as listening to a drunken oaf constantly jammer on about nothing of value...  The good sides can be summarized quickly; the art style is pretty fantastic, the music is overall good if a bit spotty in places, and the way skills interreact with eachother can give some very interesting results... even if they feel overtly sanitized.   The bad sides are... not so easy to talk about.  The way you figure out the story in the game is not by gameplay. Every character you meet (dead or about to be as they are) leave behind skills for you. These skills can be slotted in 3 manners; 1, As an actual usable skill 2. Augmenting another 3. As a passive. To unlock the story, every skill you get must be once planted in one of these slots for a minimum duration of one combat where the skill must be used. The way the story is delivered to you is a couple of paragraphs of plaintext with some uninteresting and unenlightening comments given by the voiceactor. This would be fine and understandable if the game were like Baldur's Gate, where you expect to ponder on choices and actually react to dialogue... this is as interesting way to deliver a story as reading a random fanfiction about something you are inherently assumed to care about, even if you're told pretty much nothing of it.  The combat is... an incredibly dull blend of active and turn-based in the same vein, if worse, that Fallout 3/New Vegas VATS system screwed things up. It's difficult to explain, but i'll try: You can use your skills in real time, they have short cooldowns and differing amount of animation times to use them. However, you pretty much never will, because there's an alternative... ultimately more boring method to fight, which is required of you in most fights, (as you have no other way of dodging enemy attacks) the turn-based system. The turn system practically freezes time for you, allows you to do a set number of actions, including movement, until a certain amount of time is used up, after which your character will perform the actions automatically in pseudo-freeze time. This system trivializes any and all difficulty in the game, and yet it is absolutely necessary that you utilize it.  After you've used the turn system, you wait for it to recharge for a few seconds in real time, and just so happens, pretty much every skill you have will be on cooldown during this time... so you can't have any kind of fun during waiting it to come back, unless you consider hiding behind breakable walls and just casually walking (running not allowed) away from enemies.  There are also spikes in difficulty, but even with a vast amount of things that are supposed to make the game more difficult (They really don't, such as needing an arbitrary additional hit before you can collect the capsule that makes an enemy respawn is not about difficulty, it's about tedium), the game is overall non-challenging to likely anyone. 'Spikes in Difficulty' just means you walk away slightly further from your enemies. The combat feels sluggish, there's no adrenaline rush for achieving anything, and it all feels like a big chore.  The game also keeps crashing both itself and steam, because for some reason they're using a really poorly coded version of Demon's/Dark souls type system where you see blurry phantoms of other players roaming about. If there's any sort of a hitch in the system, the game freezes up and crashes Steam with it... and there's nothing you can do about it, outside of doing it in offline mode, and this game certainly is not worth that much effort. --- Ultimately it's a hugely disappointing experience for me.  As an aside: I should know well better to buy titles from indie devs that hit it big only once before, as personally, Arcen had already burnt me violently on that regard. Having loved AI War, the abysmal A Valley Without Wind deserves nothing but scorn. This isn't as bad, comparatively, but considering how unconditionally Bastion was loved... it's not a far off deal.",

But if you were expecting Bastion like gameplay, like I was, you won't get that. This is NOT a hack and slash. Its kind of like the V.A.T.S system from Fallout where you can play in real time, but you can also stop time and plan out moves. Each has pros and cons, real time allows you to spam attacks without cooldown, but if you use the stop time mechanic Turn(), you can plan out moves for maximum damage, but afterwards you are not able to use your Functions till Turn() recharges. Its a very fun system, and one that has a lot of replayability for a few more playthroughs. One of my favorite parts of the game is that nothing is spoon fed to you. You figure out the story and what happened to the city of Cloudbank through expositon from terminals you find through out the game. Even your Functions contribute to the story, with each Function being the soul of dead citizen that the titular sword absorbed. Anyhow, I got carried away. This game is a work of art, nothing less of a masterpeice. Go and buy it. It is a bit on the short side, though I wouldn't really know since I didn't beat it yet.

The gameplay is heavily dependent on tactics and strategies, but the game itself guides the players to easily grasp the concepts to really shine through by utilizing a dash of planning skills.  On a different note (pardon the pun), the music is sublime from each scene-to-scene, and aurally stimulating as the play styles switch back and forth. The electronica genre of the soundscape in its entirety really befits the aesthetically vivid and stark future-esque art of the game without being 'done too much' or juxtaposed in any way. The female vocal line that weaves in and out of the songs really brings-out Red's story and personality even when she... has nothing to say. The soundtracks are truly captivating - and as a music major, I don't say this lightly!  The art, too, is very stunning. The cutscenes are rich in vibrant colors and are drawn (painted) to seem as they were done with a dry-brush. They are highly stylized, chic, and tell a lot more than an average 3D CGI HD 60FPS over-the-top animation can. Seriously, you don't need a lot of motions and actions to make a scene seem interesting. Ever read a beautifully-drawn comic book before? That's pretty much how it feels to watch these cutscenes.  Finally, what would the music and art be without a great story to support? Well, they'll still be good music and art... but the story is ALSO good, I assure you! It has a pungent aroma of a modern-noir. To list a few, it has a femme fatale protagonist, an organized group of criminals as your antagonists, dangerous alleyways, cityscapes, and it's even topped with the quintessential 'I have to gather more clues to figure out what's really going on' theme that exists in almost all noir fictions. However, in the midst of all these elements, the creators have planted a painfully obvious yet mild romance that continues to blossom between the star-crossed protagonists. Well, what would a good noir fiction BE without a little bit of romance, huh?  Overall, I believe Transistor will be a great addition to anyone who enjoys games with highly aesthetic qualities (BOTH in music and in art), a well-written story, and a rather unique playing style. If ANYTHING, this game is like an interactive comic book that's definitely 'worth reading' even as a casual reader. ...You know what I mean.

The story seemed really cool, but its overly-vague mysteries became a bit tiresome and only served to alienate me from really caring about what was going on. The only thing that sticks is the love story.  The ending was not presented clearly which again detracted from any satisfaction I could have gotten from it. I shouldn't need to look online to see what the general consensus about the end was.  The best thing I can say about this game is that, like Bastion, the music was unforgettable and amazingly beautiful.  7/10",

On with that spoiler I mentioned.  *** SPOILER WARNING ***  The ending of the game doesn't really explain why or how. The 'bad' guys wanted to reshape the world, and you took their paintbrush. The game ends with you just doing what they were planning all along, you wave your hands and build a few statues. You run around and build your world on their canvas for a while. Kind of feels like someone had an idea for a plot but then never decided how they wanted to end it. Or who the protagonist should be. That said, I still enjoyed every minute of it.   ",

Certianly it lends a lot to Supergiant's last game, Bastion (another excellent game. Spoiler there? Oh well...), but Bastion's strenght wasn't in innovation, really.  Transistor's strength lies in its excecution, in smoothness of purpose and design. Of doing what it does not with originality of gameplay, but doing it WELL. One does not simply walk through a series of rooms, idly connected to create a singular pathway. One is traversing a city, and there is no doubt that you are. The enemies start out simple and have such basic 'gimicks', but they soon not only gain new ones, but start to have wonderful and frustrating synergy at the same time.   Even the concept of new abilities really has nothing 'new' per se, but dovetails neatly together in such interesting ways. A single ability can either be used as a primary attack technique, or it can provide an enhancement to another technique, OR it can provide an overall passive bonus. Simple, yes? And yet both elegant and effective: A single new technique suddenly opens up all manner of new tactics.  Did I mention the music? If there's one thing that Supergiant seems to have locked down more than anything, it's soundtrack, and it shows in spades here. The songs fit the ambiance of the levels, adding that little extra to mood, and frankly they dammed well stand on their own, without even a game to be set to them.  Are other games 'more innovative'? Probably. Are they 'Newer, with sharper more realistic graphics?' I suppose.   Do those games let you sit back at the end of a session and just marvel at what you've seen and done and heard, and think 'That was Beautiful'? I don't think so.  Don't cheat yourself.

The combat system is a unique blend of action + tactical elements which relies heavily on the latter during NG+. The soundtrack, not surprisingly, is just as ethereal and imaginative as Bastion's; if not more so. The story is a retelling of lost love and the tribulations of Red, the singer, as she tackles the Process in the city of Cloudbank. If I could fault the game, I would say that the story is a bit too short and the lack of an alternate ending (unlike Bastion) detracts slightly from the replayability. Still, the sandbox tests add a bit more of a challenge after the main story is complete.  Recommended.",

What you're seeing is other players moving around the same level you're on. - Don't be afraid to do the tests in the Sandbox, you will gain XP. - Try to use the different skills in active, upgrade AND passive roles.

I used the same skill set up from the very beginning of the game to the end, which was Crash(Jaunt,Bounce) in one slot and literally just spamming the A button on my controller for every battle. Planning in Turn() became irrelevant even with all Limiters engaged because everything was too easy since nothing had the chance to counter my moves. Even in the second play through everything is getting totally rekt from pretty much the starting and cheapest skills in the game. But never the less, it's still fun.

            "review_text": "From the makers of bastion comes transistor, a short but unique experience of action and turn based rpg combined into one package. I love bastion and I have looked forward to this game for awhile. My first impression is the game feels like bastion right away because of the voice accompanying you throughout the game and also the artstyle certainly resembles bastion's as well. The strongest aspect of the game is definitely the atmosphere and the story for me. They are unlike any other games I have seen in a long while.   I do not want to spoil the story much, but basically you play as Red, a singer and her boyfriend, a talking sword. You are on a journey to uncover strange happenings around town. The story focuses on a slightly dark scifi theme and a love theme on the side with a dash of light humor. There is somewhat a typical save the world scenario but it is not cliched that much, and I still enjoy the unpredictability up until the very end.   The music sounds contemporary which you might find intriguing. However for me, they do no evoke much emotions, only slight admiration from me. But they suit the game's atmosphere very well! You can unlock the music player by completing tests, similar to dreams in bastion.   Controls feel abit awkward at first because the game does not really explain them well at first. But once you get used to it, it is not bad at all. You will do fine with mouse and keyboard without a gamepad or joystick. The controls are quite similar to your standard MMO. 4 active skillslots assigned to 1 to 4, and use your mouse to move. There are alternative ways to do it, but i think that is the way to go.   The gameplay feels a little weak compared to bastion simply because it feels like it is caught between action and turn based. Aside from being a standard action rpg like bastion, here you have the option to freeze the game and take all day to decide your next moves while your enemy stands waiting. However, using this option will disable most of your skills for a certain period of time after you finish, leaving you vulnerable (can be bypassed with skill setup). This feature is optional to use throughout the game and you can finish the game without it, with the exception of the final battle. The beauty here is that you can tailor your skill build to suit your playing style, similar to bastion. Want to play it like a turn based rpg or action rpg? Tune your skills to suit your playing style. Personally I chose to play it like a normal action rpg instead of turn based intuitively, and sorry to say bastion is better here. I think this game is better played turn based style, where you can experiment with alot of different combos. Or you can certainly do both!   You can increase the difficulty of the game according to your taste just like bastion. Except they call it limiters here and you gain bonus xp as the difficulty increases.  The replayability is low because the game is very short and does not have any sidequests other than the tests, similar to the dreams in bastion. You can play the game from the beginning again carrying over your level and skills. The enemy levels up as you do this time. THe maximum level is 30 and easily achieved on the 2nd playthrough if you keep the difficulty high. What is also missing is the scoring system, which also lowers replayability.   Overall this game is short because it is meant to be a low budget game, with minimal to no animation during the story cutscenes and minimal content. However the game is worth your money because even though it is a short game, it is a good one and thus worth experiencing.",

You can use your abilities either in real time or use the planning mode to unleash more firepower upon your foes at the cost of a serious cooldown afterwards.

But at the same time Transistor is very different and it takes all the Bastion's best feats to the whole new level.  There are two main gameplay improvements: the Turn, and the Functions.  The Turn is a kind of tactical pause during which you may plan several moves. These moves are almost instantly performed when you unpause. Then you run around and try to avoid enemy fire while the Turn cools down. So, in fact, game's mostly about tactical planning.  The Functions are a sort of replacement for weapons and skills. Every Function represents a soul of a certain VIP of the Transistor world. When you use a certain Function, you get some info about the person this Function/soul used to belong to. It's also important that you may combine Functions. Each of them may be installed as a Passive Bonus, an Action or an Action Bonus. And each Function has different effects in all of those three possible roles.  I also was impressed how the same voice actor Logan Cunningham sounded different and new. While in Bastion he was more of a cowboy by the bonfire, in Transistor he sounds more as an old friend in a very unfriendly city.  The city itself is great and atmopsheric. It reminds me of Bioshock, Shadowrun and No One Lives Forever at the same time.",

I was a huge Bastion fanboy from the get-go due to its unique atmosphere and its fusion of gameplay mechanics and story flavor. Combined with the fact that Supergiant is a tiny studio holding its weight against the massive giants in the industry, I was eagerly rooting for Transistor. It completely exceeded my expectations and is hands down my favorite game of all time. The gameplay itself is nuanced and is built off of one of the most interesting upgrade systems I've seen to date; instead of upgrading stats, you unlock functions that can be used as an active ability, a modifier to another active, or as a constant passive boost. This leads to an absurd number of combinations, each of which have value in different situations. The story itself is jam-packed with feels and left hooks. I won't give too much away, but suffice to say it definitely turns the standard 'see antagonist group, fight antagonists one by one' formula way on its head. Darren Korb (the audio director at Supergiant) definitely upped his game on this one, so I highly recommend picking up the OST along with it. Can't recommend this game enough.",

            "review_text": "Supergiant games has struck lighting again with their latest entry in to the action Rpg genre, Transistor.  The makers of Bastion brings you to the cyberpunk city of Cloudbank, a city despite its color and flare, has a few things going on. The main character, and the character you control throughout your adventure, Red, is a songstress that has a bit of a rough night, from dealing with an assassination attempt on her life, to losing her voice, and is now in possession of a weapon which now contains the data of the person who helped her narrowly escape. Both of you wade through the city, fighting a group of mechanical creatures called the process, who has taken over the city in the meantime. It all adds up to an action filled journey as you try to seek retribution for the attempt on Reds life, and the connection between the process and the transistor.  The story also isn't told in a conventional sense, as from the very start of the game you are thrown into the middle of a situation and left to figure things out on your own. You could probably complete the game a couple of times and still not understand everything around you. The only narration is through the sword itself, which is voiced by Logan Cunningham, the narrator of Bastion. The narration though isn't really narration as this time he is accompanying you on your adventure instead of talking about things in a past tense as it was with Bastion.  The game doesn't fail to please the eye with its distinct art style, which fits the tone of the story that show great resemblance to Blade Runner, with a touch a Tron, you will traverse through the roof tops, and city streets, and even the inside of a beast. Each location has some sort of hidden secret or a puzzle for you to solve in order to get through to the next area, they are pretty simple though, so don't expect anything too tough on the brain. There is a sanctuary of sorts that you discover that has training rooms for you to get better at the speed, planning, and learning how to survive more efficiently.    Which brings us to the true meat and potatoes of the game, is its combat system which mixes both real time combat, and turn based combat, with the latter being the most efficient way to get things done. Even some of the story is connected to the combat as you collect abilities, called functions, as each function has a character bio of a previous owner of the transistor or just noteworthy citizens of Cloudbank. You can unlock more of that character's background by equipping a function into an active slot , abilities that can be used in battle, upgrade slot, or a passive slot which encourages a lot of experimentation with abilities. It takes a little bit to get adjusted to, and while learning its not hard to win fights, its hard to win them with style. But once you get the hang of things you can always get the biggest bang for your buck. The combat system encourages experimentation, as when you lose all your health during a fight, you dont exactly die, but instead you lose a function and it gets taken out of your rotation for a while, while this may seem like a debilitating feature, this keeps players from the dull nature that min maxing brings and puts them right back into experimenting with other abilities.  While you can use abilities outside of the planning phase, the fact of the matter is that in most cases there are usually more mobs than you can handle, which in turn makes plan mode the only choice in dealing with most fights. Great for those who like to be strategic in their battles, not so great for those that just want to run in there and hack and slash. The game does have a new game plus feature for those that want to continue to go for achievements, and maybe to take a hidden path or two that you may have missed your first time around. There is no difficulty setting, although the higher level you go more mobs are thrown your way with upgraded abilities. To give your self more of a challenge, you have the option to apply limiters to your self, which is essentially a handicap feature. You can make the Process do more damage, make more spawn in a fight, or you can limit the amount of abilities that you have access to, to do get the results you want. It can get pretty rough, with quite a few limiters on, but each limiter adds a percentage bonus to experience that you get...and give you bit of bragging rights.   The story also isn't told in a conventional sense, as from the very start of the game you are thrown into the middle of a situation and left to figure things out on your own. You could probably complete the game a couple of times and still not understand everything around you. The only narration is through the sword itself, which is voiced by Logan Cunningham, the narrator of Bastion. The narration though isn't really narration as this time he is accompanying you on your adventure instead of talking about things in a past tense as it was with Bastion.  Supergiant games could have rested on the laurels of their success with Bastion, but decided to take a good risk and mix up the formula a bit with Transistor, which works good in some areas, and fall short in other. But all in all its a well made game with a bit of re-playability. I give Transistor a 4/5.",

But the real shine of the game is the combat system which presents a great amount of customizability. Notably the pace of a fight is refreshing since the game devides action into a relaxing planning phase and a hectic realtime phase. Another important aspect is the replayability the game offers through a mode called recursion (which I think is what the game is mostly about) and the difficulty customization the user has through so-called limiters, which, in my opinion, is the best way to solve the problem of creating difficulty levels in a game.

            "review_text": "I was not hugely impressed with Transistor; those expecting something remotely as good as Bastion will be dissapointed. While the game is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, it wasn't quite the gem Bastion was.  The soundtrack was really good, but for some reason the developers thought it would be a good idea to hide a lot of it and make it unlockable via challenges. That makes no sense to me. The music that Darren Korb makes is amazing, I do not know why they would not take advantage of it at every turn to create the memorable experiences so many of us had with Bastion. The music being unlockable would not be that annoying to me had the game been more fun.  The game was not very fun for me, the controls felt clunky and while they encouraged experimenting with their system of augmenting abilities with other abilities to make different variations, it had the opposite effect of what they intended. The way the mechanics work, it encourages the player to combine greasy abilities together and just spam them. Their entire 'pause and plan the fight' system ended up making boss fights a matter of setting up three of the four abilities to cost more memory than your main one so that when you lost all your health you would just lose the abilities you did not care about. There was no strategy or skill involved, just simple math.  What the game did an amazing job at was the art. The game looks beautiful and stylish, blending great voice acting, beautiful environments and interesting enemy/character designs. The story is also a strong point. It does not show everything to people, and rewards those who take an interest and try to find as much information as possible. All of this coupled with a [SEMI-SPOILER] tragic yet beautiful ending left me liking the entire experience.  TLDR: Great story, beautiful art, good music, mediocre gameplay, not nearly as good as Bastion.",

            "review_text": "... Buy this game...  Lets start with the ratings  OVERALL: 9/10  Gameplay: 10 Sound: 10 Replayability: 7 Story: 8  And now the reasoning. GAMEPLAY: 10 I came from Bastion, not realizing this was made by the same people until I started it up. In this case, that was a good thing, because I'd come to enjoy the old world charm of bastion and likely would have been turned off of the digital-world theme. However, I was rewarded almost instantly with my experience with Bastion and appreciated the enigmatic narrative taking a back seat to a consistant battle engine that was fun to play and catered to whatever my mood happened to be at the time, 'Turn' based combat, or real time. Enemy variety was interesting and posed different challenges based on my abilities and the 'terrain' in each fight. This aspect seems lost to many developers who simply script enemies with more health and hit harder without adding any depth to the combat. The ability customizability absolutely roped me in. I adore being able to customize loadouts in attempts to maximize potential of one aspect or another.  One of my favorite builds wasn't even the most powerful. Charming enemies for long periods of time and letting them kill each other while my pet ran around helping them, and collecting cells spawned more temporary friendly minions. I was having, dare I say it, FUN!  It allows people to take on whatever role is comfortable and play through the game at their own speed and play style.  I gotta give them props for the ability variety and how effective they are based on what enemy types are present.   SOUND: 10 No conflicting information. Every sound quickly becomes associated with the result happening on the screen. And the soundtrack fits the narrative. And like that cheesy review I read about pausing to listen to Red sing... Darn it if I didn't do the same thing...  My tab key got stuck several times. &gt;_&gt;  REPLAYABILITY: 7 I am grading this more harshly due to the fact that there ARE side challenges that you can complete to elongate the original play through, but they aren't available to you again after that. While being able to replay through the story does allow you to catch things you may have missed on the first pass, it doesn't offer too much else. However, I still catch myself playing through the story from time to time, just to remember the smart design of it all.  STORY: 8  I felt there was a few more questions to be answered, or things that could have been available to those who wanted more information. I read as much text as I could find in order to learn more about this world and the city, and was admittedly a bit disappointed in not knowing the origins of the town and other such things. BUT ONLY A BIT! The rest of the narrative was very well done, and allowed the player to fill in the gaps without insulting their intelligence. I still remember the surprise from the begining of the game resulting in immediate intrigue...   TLDR; It's a bit pricey for how long it lasts, but the entire experience is QUALITY for the time spent, in my opinion. If you catch it on sale, even at 25%... pick it up if it seems interesting to you. I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.",

            "review_text": "Transistor is definitely one of the most unique video games I've ever played, and easily stands as my game of 2014. It's a linear, narrative-driven action RPG with a lush, beautiful and unique art style. It's the aesthetic of this game that hits you first; it looks incredible and obvious love and immense skill have gone into the hand-drawn environments, giving the game a very 'textured' feel. Although the game is linear, the detailing in the art makes you feel like you could wander off the rails at any moment you choose.  The second thing that hits you with Transistor is the music. Employing moody, atmospheric trip-hop style soundscapes, Transistor's soundtrack is achingly beautiful and complements the melancholy story and cyberpunk visuals perfectly. The soundtrack is further enhanced by several incredible vocal performances by Ashley Barrett, who brings a languid, jazz-inflected feel to the songs. Not only does Ashley Barrett's voice add a poignant humanity to the music, it also enhances the story through its lyrics.  Speaking of story, this game employs a sparse narrative, creating a sense of roleplay by having you piece together events at the same pace Red does. This game does not hold your hand through the narrative and you'll have to read every scrap of lore, listen to every bit of dialogue and take in every cryptic clue in the song lyrics to help you make sense of Transistor's enigmatic narrative. This put some people off, but I personally loved it. This narrative pieceing makes it feel like the story unfolds organically, with any furthering of the narrative being a result of *your* actions, as opposed to have bits of story crammed down your throat when the game deems it necessary. It's a very Dark Souls-esque way of doing things and I loved it.  As to the narrative itself, I won't spoil it, but Transistor tells the story of Red, an enchanting singer in the city of Cloudbank whose voice has been taken from her, and a mysterious man whose soul (taking the form of computer data) has been trapped in the assassin's blade meant for you. Together, you undertake a journey to get revenge and find out what's happening to your city as it is overrun by aggressive robots known as 'the process.'   Now, on to gameplay. Transistor employs a mixture of real time combat and a pseudo-turn based system, whereby Red freezes time, chooses attacks to perform and then executes these actions at lightning speed. It's an interestng gimmick that allows you to deal with the often overwhelming number of enemies you'll face on your own. Where Transistor's gameplay really shines is in its 'Function' system. Functions are essentially abilities that can be slotted as either passive or activated, granting passive buffs or usable abilities. However, each function can also be slotted as an upgrade to another function, augmenting it with different characteristics and buffs. This means that you have essentially endless variety in your ability loadouts, with each ability changing itself drastically depending on which other functions you pair it with. It's an elegant and extremely fun system, if a little poorly explained in-game, and it makes Transistor a very unique experience among action RPGs.  I could honestly wax lyrical about Transistor all day, but what it really comes down to is this; do you want an action RPG with a unique and inventive combat system that encourages creativity, visuals and sound design to die for, and a sparse, melancholy story that unfolds in a slow, organic manner? If not, don't buy this game.   If that sounds like your kettle of fish, then welcome to Cloudbank.",

It's emphasis on characters, setting, and narrative give the game a constant direction and mysterious allure that will keep you wanting to play on. Transistor's quality does not end there though, the gameplay is very innovative and enjoyable as well. As you unlock more functions (attack and buffs) and become more familar with the turn system, you start to realize how diverse the mechanics really are. As you improve you are not just getting better at what the game has laid out for you, you begin to derive unique persoanl tactics that allow you to take the combat in many different directions. On top of that, the game rewards you for trying out new function combinations by revealing more about the town and its residents as you do so, encouraging the player to try new and creative forms of gameplay. This is reinforced even more by a very fare learning curve that first allows you to get use to the system, then insists you think about trying to make strong function combinations. Though the curve is on the easier side, like Bastion, the game offers 'limiters' that can be turned on and off at checkpoints to increase the difficulty in numerious ways.  Supergiant put alot of effort into trying to craft a game that wasn't Bastion 2, while sticking to their specific art style and narrative strengths. The deeper one delves into this game, the more apparent it becomes that this is no mere cyber punk bastion clone, but a new experience entirely. With the added mechanics of time stoppage, and immense customization (even compared to Bastion) the game plays more like an RPG, and speaks more like a strange anime scif fi noir . The effort and creativity is sincerely remarkable.  I would reccomend this game to juts about anyone. The forgiving curve, well crafted story, and beautiful visual design is well suited for everyone, while the deep and rewarding combat system (and limiters) will allow VG veterans to also enjoy the game's charm.",

It's never really made clear to us if Red and the whopping 8 other people she comes into contact with are living in a computer simulation or not, and as for the fate of the greater world at large, well, you never actually see any other people around, so it seems like all is pretty much lost from the get-go. All that's left to invest you in the game, then, is the relationship between Red and the Transistor. Unfortunately, this relationship, while probably meant to be touching and impassioned, has very little support in terms of either backstory or character development throughout the game itself. This is exacerbated by the fact that Red, for (cough) 'story' reasons, is herself mostly mute. All that's left, then, is the excellent voice acting of Logan Cunningham, which, while grainy and evocative as it was in Bastion, is not enough to carry the relationship by itself.  All that being said, however, I still think this is a fairly good game in its own right, and if it weren't for the comparisons to Bastion, I think I would care about all those problems a good deal less. Play this if you enjoy action RPGs, with interesting worlds, unique art direction, and, of course, great music. Just don't expect to be too involved in the story emotionally.  Overall score: 7/10",

The story, though a little confusing at first, worked its way into something amazing and had me smiling towards the end. You can feel real emotions coming from these characters even though one is only a voice and the other as completely lost hers.  The combat is different from other games, while it can be hectic at times and the AI (especially during higher levels) can get a bit silly. Now that I've played through once, I plan to play through using limiters just to see how much harder the game play will be (I ran for a bit with 3 and found it a bit more challenging, but I'm curious as to how much further I can travel down that road.) Being able to mix up your skills means you can find different attacks that work on different enemies. The same move might not be as effective against another target, but this also means that swapping your skills around keeps the combat interesting and gets rid of that 'grinding' feel. I also like the ability to add 'passives' to your main attacks with other attacks. Usue your regular 'ping' attack and add in 'switch' and suddenly your damaged enemy is on your side. Swap it around and use your normal attacks but also add in Flood() and you're suddenly doing way more damage. Mixing them up and finding combos is actually quite fun.  I got this game from a friend as a gift while it was on sale (14.99), but don't shy away from the 19.99 price tag.

            "review_text": "Transistor is the second game by independent studio Supergiant Games, following in the footsteps of their debut masterpiece, Bastion. Although the two games work off similar perspectives and narrative styles, featuring a silent (or in this case, mute) protagonist and a single supporting character that provides narration, Transistor feels and plays fundamentally different from its predecessor.  Where Bastion was a whimsically-styled fantasy featuring traditional real-time combat and a wealth of customization, Transistor is initially much more bare-boned and linear, and decidedly more mournful in its jazz-age cyberpunk aesthetic. Red, the player character, is clearly not a soldier or adventurer like the Kid, so combat takes on a much more measured pace as you plan moves from your Turn() bar, execute them in accelerated time, then run from enemies while Turn() recharges. The Transistor is the source of your power, and is in many ways as much a character as Red herself. New Functions are unlocked as you progress through the world, allowing you a greater variety of options in to deal with new foes. Also, as in Bastion, Limiters can be enabled to increase the qualitative difficulty of the game.  The story is narrated by an unnamed male character, whose voice emanates from the Transistor. Through his eyes, you are provided insights into Red's past, as well as the history and culture of Cloudbank and the myserious power group called the Camerata. Text files attached to the Traces of deceased characters will unlock with use of their associated Functions, allowing an even deeper look into the mysteries of Cloudbank and its fall.  Overall, I found Transistor to be a masterfully crafted narrative, with art and musical assets to match. The game's unorthodox approach to narrative style and combat may be off-putting to some, and is certainly a departure from previous games of the genre. Additionally, the ability to rotate the camera to avoid foreground obstructions is never properly explained, despited being extremely helpful even in early stages of the game. Slight technical quibbles aside, I do not hesistate to give Transistor my highest recommendation.  With Transistor, Supergiant has continued their tradition of aesthetically unique world-building and narrative excellence.",

Once you really get hang for customizing functions, making combos, and timing your Turn(), every fight is extremely satisfying.

The game has just the right amount of detail in just the right places to make the city feel alive despite encountering very few actual characters.

What differentiates it from others is the narration and progress. - Visuals: the style consists of a beautifully drawn sci-fi world and blends nicely with the story. - Music: what's more to say? It's from the music director who worked on Bastion [+more songs this time]. - Combat: I found the attack customization engaging in developing different play-styles. Plus, the option to play either a hack-n-slash or take your time and plan the attacks can be refreshing when you get tired of one or the other.  Cons: - Short: the game can be finished in less than 10 hours [my stats are inflated for idealing for cards and achievement hunting]. I don't regret for buying the game, but I did buy it on sale. -Replayability: it really becomes an issue only because the game is rather short.  Overall: Get it if you liked Bastion and if the shortness bothers you, get it on sale.",

            "review_text": "Transistor is one of my most favorite games ever.  I picked it up after I accidentally stumbled upon Bastion and fell in love with it, only to experience the same, if not better, feeling again. The art is unique, the soundtrack incredibly good, and the overall atmosphere is enthralling and beautiful.  The fighting system is a kind of a mix of real-time and turn-based combat. You are given a certain number of points represented as bar and you can spend those points on performing abilities uncluding movement, think mana or energy. This whole 'picking a move' phase happens when the game is paused, but the excution itself is real time. You can use your moves any time on their own too, but this 'tactical' way is more effective.  You level up through gaining experience points, but since the individual game levels are pretty much straigthforward corridors, there's no grinding involved and the experience points come sort of naturally, without any big effort. What matters though is what you spend them on. You can either buy a new skill, unlock an upgrade slot for a move you already have an older one, or increase your memory, which in turn increases the number of moves you can have at any single time. You can't always do all of the above, but that's pretty much how it works.  On death, you lose some of your moves untill you 'recharge' at specific bind points or lose all of your moves and die. That can be kind of irritating since if the move randomly deactivated happens to be your main source of damage, you're pretty much screwed. Although it brings in a certain level of challengem it can be a lot painful.  The story is captivating, reflecting the overall mood of the game. Similarly to Bastion, there's only one narrator, which only adds to the unique feelings of the empty city.  Great game, totally recommend it.",

The music is well done and complements well. The story is not spoon fed, which does add some intrigue. Combat is probably the most unique aspect of the game and is the center piece. If you focus on these pieces of the game individually it's hard to deny them.  On the other hand, there is a painful repetition with each combat sequence. There is not enough time in between combat to really explore. When there is time to explore there is not much to find. Character development feels limited and unrewarding. These short comings can make the game just boring at times and is why I can not recommend this game.",

Firstly the game is beautiful as is the soundtrack both are reasons enough to play the game in my opinion, but if they do not hook you then the characters stories and the exploration of the world should do (I cannot promise they will). You follow the main character red and her mighty USB stick on her journey to destroy some shadowy forces that loom in the distance and as there is no exposition there is no way of finding out about the world until your character discovers it herself.

It has interesting gameplay mechanics - mainly the turn based grid system, the interesting number of skills and it's combinations, modifiers etc. - it has a nice feeling of progression.  That said, it never becomes a good game. Why? I'll tell you: while it has all of that mentioned above, it has no interesting challenges (except, perhaps, for the last Boss), enemies or encounters. It takes place in corridor levels and has no interludes or content besides combat and some challenges (that is, more combat!).  On top of that, the game sabotages itself by locking certain features in order to punish the players for failure. In combat you can only use your skills (except for Jaunt, as a main or as accessory) when your turn bar is filled up. Since you'll often use your turns to avoid punishment, it means that you are disallowed to do anything besides moving while the bar fills up again. And when you get beaten, instead of restarting, you lose one of your four skills, making combat poorer while it remains and for at least two more save points. You probably will just reset it instead of trying new stuff.  The story is pretentious. It can be pieced together and it is really quite simple at the end, but it fails from the get go to instigate the player in it's quest for retribution. You won't look forward to unveil anything, since you'll only get breadcrumbs and too little to work with.  Thus meh/10.",

Yet, some arenas are so bad you have big trouble moving in them as desired. And since moving while doing ♥♥♥♥ all is for some reason an integral part of the fighting system there are some bottleneck arenas ready to boost your ragequit potential. I filled mine. Fighting in this game is not hard, it's imprecise, that's the problem. A big one for partialy real time game.  The combat system could be great. It incorporates very Magicka-esque system of combining attacks from a set of fragments. Whether or not the unlockable limitations on you should be considered a design failure is up to you. I felt like I was presented with great set of tools to be creative with, while the dev only allowed me to carry either a mininuke and nothing else or a screwdriver, knife and a hammer. It's unnecessary. Even then the system is fun to toy with so itîs saddening but ok. However the combat has one big problem and that is phasing. You can either go with real-time cooldown base Diablo which doesn't work well (on purpose) or you enter a turn planning phase in which you give a sequence of actions to your hero and upon release she executes them. Combos and positioning all matter which is very good. However after the turn execution comes a ENJOY NOTHING phase where all your actions are limited to walking around at a constant speed trying to evade enemies and their shots and WAITING FOR YOUR TURN BAR TO FILL UP.

Or don't.  The gameplay encourages you to experiment with combat mechanics, but it is uncluttered enough not to give a casual player trouble. Personally, if variety didn't offer additional information, I likely would've stuck to the first couple of combinations unlocked -- but mix and match turned out to be fun.  The art style is bright, vibrant colors, never garish. I enjoyed the city thoroughly, just as I did the soundtrack -- oh the vocals, it's gonna be in my playlist for next several months at least.   Perhaps the most unexpected thing turned out to be, well, the story. It's sad. I had to get up and walk away from my laptop a couple of times to simply calm down. It's a story (surprisingly) about love. Not a sweeping tragic romance, it's barely spoken of really.

The miscellaneous characters aren't well explained unless you read their back stories, but little of that matters to the primary story.  The combat system is where this game shines. Mixing and matchign programs provides very interesting ways to fight and strategize. It's just too bad some of the functions aren't available until near the end which limits their use.  The music is a big part of this game. Very well done much like Bastion. There are times when you just want to listen to red hum with the music.  Overall worth the purchase.",

I love the mods and abilities of the transistor (which makes killing the enemies a great experience).  Great gameplay, great design, great music, and great voice actors.

Supergiant Games was instantly put on my radar after their first game, so I was delighted to find out that they were making another game. However, I fell into this idea that it would just be impossible for them to make a game as memorable and creative as Bastion. I was very wrong. Transistor is simply a masterpiece.   Pros- - Beautiful art direction and fluid animation - Memorable characters and excellent voice work by Logan Cunningham - Interesting combat with varied skills and combinations - Satisfying progression - Twists on gameplay via 'Limiters' - Quirky interactions between the main cast - New Game Plus - Great Developers - Divine OST  Cons- - Camera can (very rarely) be cumbersome due to architecture - Story can be somewhat difficult to follow early on (didn't detract from my experience, though others may find it jarring) - I wish there was more of it; completed my initial playthrough in roughly 6 1/2 hours.   In short: If you played Bastion and loved it, play Transistor. If you're looking for a game with great design and all around excellent craftsmanship, play Transistor. If you're looking for something different, play Transistor. And so, with all things said and done- play Transistor.",

Those of you who dislike turn based gameplay can play without utilizing this aspect if desired.  The difficulty is pretty reasonable and it can be ampped up if the player desires a challange. There are a few mechanics that encourage and indeed, force you to experiement with the customization that the combat can offer after a small introductionary segement.   I feel the Story tells more than Bastion did but at the same time still leaves some things unexplained, offering the player to draw conclusions. Much like Bastion I encourage anyone who enjoys the Action RPG genre to play this game.

I wholly recommend the game to anybody that stumbles across it.  The gameplay is smooth, and combat picks up where Bastion was lacking. Customization of your ability loadout, passives, and upgrades is wholesome and fairly deep. While the game has no difficulty settings, it does have a set of 'Limiters' to amp up the difficulty by warping some of the core gameplay mechanics, making it increasingly difficult to survive and move through the story with each one activated.  Darren Korb once again provides a masterful score of music, along with Ashley Barrett representing the protagonist, Red, in the vocals. While the total score is a masterpiece, listening to it pre-emptively can and will spoil much of the symbolism and plot of the game, so I don't recommend it. However, the game itself is worth playing just for the music.  The art style is gorgeous, and is one of the game's defining features. Coupled with the narration which one of the main characters does throughout the entire storyline, voiced by Logan Cunningham - the same narrator from Bastion! - the game never feels empty or alone. With a silent protagonist, and one who won't shut up and describes everything that happens in Mr. Cunningham's beautiful and skilled voice, you learn to fall in love with the characters.  Overall, I one-hundred-percent recommend Transistor to any and all. It's a 10/10, and the only flaw is that it's short, and ends abruptly - despite this, the plot fits perfectly to end here, and it creates a more artistic, and complete piece with the ending.",

What's more, the combat and story are also good. Though you do need to approach it with the right mindset. As far as the combat goes, you really should use the optional 'limiters' to increase the strategic depth of the fights. That's when the combat system really shines. Essentially the game starts on the easiest difficulty and gives you the option to make it harder at a faster rate when you gain levels. Though if the main story leaves you wanting a little more fulfillment, the side challenges are fantastic and make great use of the combat.  As for the story, it's much more along the lines of a sci-fi short story than Bastion was, though it still has their very distinct method of narrative progression. While it certainly shares a significant amount of the narrative structure from Bastion, it... This is kinda hard to explain, but it seems to me that Transistor is driven more by themes and ideas, whereas Bastion was driven more by relational emotion (emotion of relationships?). That's not to say Transistor doesn't have a strong theme of relationship, it very much does, but it's quieter. It stirs in the backdrop. Once the big event has done its course, its brought in to the forefront as if the character is saying, 'My only intention was ever this. All else was coincidental, to me.'  I've seen some reviews that said the ending was not very emtionally satisfying, but I think that's because (and this may be somewhat spoilerish, but should actually enhance your experience) the main character's goals are different from what the player might be tricked into thinking her goal is.  So yeah, I like it.",

Let me get the negatives out of the way: It's as short as Bastion, especially if you skip the challenge mode stuff. Also I ran into a handful of areas with very significant framerate drops.  But here are the reasons you should get this game: -Incredible story from beginning to end. There are still questions left after the (amazing) ending, but they're not significant enough to detract from the overall narrative. -Interesting combat system. I wasn't sold on the combat after seeing the initial trailer, but after getting a few abilities I discovered just how well designed the combat is. It's fun, it's challenging, it can vary wildly from playstyle to playstyle, and it just works. -Really neat upgrade system. You only have 4 'active' abilities, however you very quickly obtain more than that. The abilities that are not being used can be put into the upgrade slots of the active abilities. As an example, One ability has the power to generate explosives. When putting that ability into your default 'swing' ability, your swing now does AoE damage. Also, much of the lore and backstory is hidden behind unlocks in these abilities. By using these abilities in battle, either as an 'active' ability or an upgrade, you unlock a tiny bit more lore. It's a fantastic way to both immerse the player further into the world and also encourage them to try out all of the abilities. -The music. Get the soundtrack. No question about it. If you played Bastion, you know exactly how amazing the soundtrack is.  This is the best game I have played this year. The guys over at Supergiant are truly masters of their craft. 10/10",

            "review_text": "Five hours in so far and I must say I'm loving it. Similar art style to bastion but with a digital and art nouveau coat of paint. The story is interesting and has some rather deep themes of self determination and a p[erson's place in a near utopian world. The world itself is a beautiful depiction of the ultimate ideal of a democratic free market utopia with hints of a plot worthy of John Galt's madness. It's nice to see the idea of people trying to make a utopia better, it is an over looked plot idea. On top of that the game is a wonder to play. The combat is deep and layered, with a lot of the choices firmly under player control. The game encourages actively varying one's play style as it is the only way to learn more about the world and the people in it. The turn mechanics is interesting and does require thought and preparation, as things don't always work out the way you expect them to, esspecially later when enemies begin to passively inteact with you when the time stop is enabled. So far my only qualms are with the default mouse and keyboard controls, they just seem a bit awkward, if you're determined to play on mouse and keyboard I would advise binding the abilities to buttons on the mouse, or just using a controller, the controls are very tight and most of the time precision is only required when using Turn, and those mistakes can be undone easily. $20 may seem a bit steep but this game is worth it. If you can't aford it then I would highly adivse putting it on your wishlist and grabbing it as soon as it goes on sale, or watch the Humble Bundle page like a hawk. Suffice to say, Super Giant Games has done it again and created another game that I will hold up with a 'Games are Art' sign.",

Because it's good and I want people to know, my thanks to the developpers if you want :) Didn't played Bastion, but I read it was quite good so i decided to give Transistor a go... Results:  Graphism are great. I mean, I started gaming on a gameboy... So I remember when photorealism wasn't a thing. Ambiance is important, and here: you can feel the love of the studio for their work. +1  Music is just fan-ta-stic! I'm gonna buy the OST and put it in my MP3 'cos it's just THAT good for me.  Gameplay: the combat system is great and you'll jump from just bashing ennemies to carefully planning your moves in a blink of a eye. Played with a gamepad and it just felt great.  Difficulty: want a good challenge? Yeahhh... That's not a challenge at all, you're not here for that. BUT! The game has his difficulty arranged by steps. Let's say I played 3/4 of the game without dying once and the last 1/4 had some challenge, had to search for the good combo and all... Let's say I'm ok with the softcore ways here, BUT there is a newgame+ which I didn't tested yet, so: I suppose this part has more struggle :)  Story: won't say a thing here, but totaly liked it. The kind of mindf***k story that you travel with and still think about after, plus, it give you urges to redo the game and fully understand what you missed first time. Totally my case here.  Lenght: didn't rushed it, finished it in one sit ==&gt; 6 hours strait. So, yeah, not that long... But will come back for the NG+ as the story and the gameplay are cool and I want to see how they pushed it, I bet the NG+ is a good challenge :) Plus, it's a 20$ game, not a AAA. Totally ok with that.  Conclusion: yeah, I recommand it. But, why? Because it's was a great ADVENTURE, developpers made a great work, you can tell, playing it, that they consider gaming like an art, not just like an industry. And that's the kind of game I want to see more of.  tl;dr So art, much game, very wow, such recommandation",

In case you think the developer’s name is familiar, it should be. They’re responsible for the fantastic Bastion. Released in 2011 for the Xbox 360 and Steam, Bastion was a ‘sleeper hit’. A fantastic top-down action RPG, with an excellent story, thoroughly enjoyable characters, great gameplay and beautiful art style. Bastion had it all going on.  Needless to say, I entered into Transistor with high hopes. But fortunately, Transistor not only met my expectations, it exceeded them.  Set in the futuristic sci-fi city of Cloudbank, Transistor sees you take control of the character Red, one of the most renowned singers within the Cloudbank. You start the game lost and under heavy pursuit from the ‘Process’. Fortunately, you quickly discover the mystical great sword called the ‘Transistor’ buried in the chest of some poor unfortunate soul.  From the moment you wield the Transistor, the constant narration begins. Logan Cunningham reprises his role of narrator here, a role he played exceptionally well in Bastion. And much the same as Bastion, the majority of the game’s narrative is told through this narration. However, you’ll also find terminals throughout the world that house short news stories, polls and character profiles. Interestingly you’re able to interact with these news stories by casting votes in certain polls and posting replies to stories.  The various ways in which the story is told make it very easy to pick up whilst exploring the world, and without getting bogged down by heavy dialogue scenes or pages of in game text. It’s up to you how much you get out of Transistor, but exploring the world of Cloudbank City is something you’re certainly going to want to do. Like Bastion before it, the art style in Transistor is beautiful and that alone compelled me to explore every corner of the city to see as much of it as possible.  The combination of excellent storytelling, beautiful art style and a simply fantastic soundtrack all work well to suck you into the world of Cloudbank City and simply won’t let go. All things considered, Cloudbank is an extremely enjoyable place to be, or rather it would be were it not for the ‘Process’ hounding your every move.  The Process are robotic minions under the control of the Camerata, the group who tried – and failed – to assassinate Red using the Transistor. So her quest to defeat the Camerata sees Red clearing each section of Cloundbank City of the Process.  The combat is a mixture between a real-time and turn-based system. You can run about freely attacking enemies, but after a time runs down, you can pause the action and plan your attacks and movements, in a similar style to the V.A.T.S system featured in the latest Fallout Games. Then, once you’ve selected your movements, once the game is un-paused, Red will quickly perform the actions. The option to pause the combat and plan your attacks certainly adds an enjoyable depth of tactical decision-making to the game and due to the variety in different combat moves that are presented in the form of ‘memory modules’ you attach to the Transistor, there is a lot of depth to be found in Transistor’s combat. The memory modules themselves can be found, or rather, extracted from the few corpses littered throughout Cloudbank. These modules do appear rather baffling at first, I certainly felt overwhelmed with options, but as you become more accustomed to the combat, so it becomes easier to explore and combine the different modules to shake up the attack options available to Red. Before long, you’ll soon figure out which ones work best for you.  Here-in lies the only fault I’ve found with Transistor, Despite the variety of move-sets on offer, toward the midpoint of the game – especially in the later sections – the combat started to become rather repetitive. As soon as I found which combination of memory modules would allow me to dispatch my enemies the most efficiently, there was little inspiration for me to delve any deeper into lesser-used modules.  That’s not to say that Transistor gets easy, just that the combat soon descended into me moving through motions until either the fight was over or I died.  Death, however, is another aspect that Transistor approaches differently. Once Red has sustained enough damage, a module becomes damaged and becomes unavailable during that fight. As a result, you’re going to have to wait until you’ve made it to the next area before repairs can be made. It’s an interesting twist on the combat, yet I found it only worked to slow the combat down, which can also be said about the ‘Turn’ system. Red can only use her attacks if the charge meter is filled and using the Turn system will, more often than not, deplete the charge bar leaving you run around helpless until it recharges.  Also at odds with the pace of the game is the challenge system. Every so often, at different points in Transistor, you’re given the chance to exit the actual game world to a relaxing seaside resort hub-world. This hub-world is populated with a couple of doors that present different challenges behind each, such as defeating x amount of enemies in an alotted time. I found the different challenges to be quite frustrating at times and certainly didn’t find that they fitted in well with the rather ‘laid-back’ nature of the main game. However, the reward of unlocking additional music from the soundtrack was certainly worth it as Darren Kob, composer of the music in Bastion, has simply out done himself yet again with Transistor.  Transistor is a very different beast to its older sibling Bastion despite the obvious similarities. It’s slower paced and certainly more atmospheric and it represents a game studio that have matured over the course of development of both games. I’m certainly finding myself exploring every corner of the world in order to learn as much about Red and the mysterious Transistor that I can. And the great thing, the more I learn, the further I want to explore. How many games can you say that about?  The Good Stuff  Enthralling narrative and characters. Beautiful art style. The excellent soundtrack is worth the price tag alone. The Bad Stuff  Combat becomes repetitive all too quickly. Challenges can be quite frustrating … I don’t want it to end…  Final Analysis  Transistor is certainly the most enjoyable game I’ve played this year. It offers up a world full of mystery and emotion. The narrative will suck you and set you searching through the beautifully drawn world of Cloudbank City on a quest to learn as much as possible. The few characters in the game are steeped with personality, helped only by the constant narration from the, once again, excellent Logan Cunningham.  Quite simply, you’ll find yourself falling in love with Transistor every second you spend in its world.

The multiple, combinable Functions() give combat a surprising amount of depth for having only four attacks available at any time, the Turn() planning mode allows you to give even some of the harier fights an organized and harmonic feel. The story is well-crafted, and is told mostly not through cutscenes, but through unlockable Function() profiles and text messages.  Many of the big players from Bastion return on the development side. The music is beautifully done, with Darren Korb in charge once again. The sparse voiceover sees Logan Cunningham again in the role of narrator/mentor, and it never feels like there is too much or too little voiceover.  The only complaint one could really level at Transistor is that it feels short, but that is a complaint one can level at a lot of games. Very recommended, 9/10.",

The voice acting is top notch, serving only to enhance the in game experience and the storyline is enjoyable, intriguing, and well thought out.  The combat is innovative with an RPG-turn based strategy hybrid style which was a learning curve to begin with, but hugely rewarding to grasp. I found the game to be challenging in terms of difficulty, which I see as a good thing (though different people will have varying levels of skill). There are side training challenges, which you can sink hours into, as they get progressively harder. It also has a recursive mode after the game for enhanced replayability and challenge, though I am yet to explore this in any real depth.  So overall, I absolutely recommend this game. For a game coming from an indie developer (like seriously the credits are real short. they're over in a minute) this is simply sublime and competes with the big titles.",

Once time is stopped you can plan your attack, and execute it in extreme speed. The game is set in a digital world, which is very reminiscing of Tron. Without spoiling too much, the population determines how the surrounding environment looks, and votes on how their world should change. In this democratic society, Camerata form a villainous plot to change the world for the 'better'. During the execution of this plan, Red, a musician in this world, and the Transistor are united and join forces to battle the villainy of the Camerata and the mysterious Process that now plagues their digital paradise.

For me one the biggest selling points was the soundtrack, so if you have the cash I would definetly suggest buying it with the soundtrack. The soundtrack was beautiful, and most of all, cohesive. It set the mood for epic boss fights and help relax at the more calm and chill parts of the game.  The story was also beautiful focusing mostly around the relationship between the main characters, and the item that joins them. I won't spoil anything but know that everything that happens fits into the story somehow, leading to a great ending. The connection between the characters felt real and was enough to make me feel actual emotions *gasp*. The visuals are also amazing ...  in thier own way.  In kinda the way you begin to appreciate the graphics behind borderlands or dishonest, transistor has graphics that grow on you. Its has a very unique art style the looks like a fusion a western cartoons and japanese anime. There was never a time when I was dissapointed with the graphics so rest assured that they are good.  Lastly, the combat was more satisfying than you can imagine. It has a great combination of reactive responses, and strategy. The game forces you to plan out your stategy, but leaves room to go wild on your enemies. Knowing how and when to use abilities is key. The combat is also quite punishing as your lifes are attached to your skills, so if you plan poorly you might just lose your best skills for a while.    CONS  And now the honest truths. The story is short, and I mean  really short . Only 6-7 hours of gameplay. To compensate there is an extended game mode where you can play again with your old abilites but tbh the replay value is minimal  (buying the soundtrack helps make it last longer!) .  Also for all the strengths of the combat the process of setting up your skills seemed clunky and ill desingned. Also the tutorial was very minimal, which didn't help with the getting used to transitor's unique system.  Also in terms of story if you like clarity and for everything to be explianed out perfectly (like I do) you will be dissapointed. They do expect you to fill in the gaps with hints but there are just certain elements that I feel could've been explained better.   In Closing, Transistor was a great game with new and inivative combat, stunning soundtrack, unique visuals, and a story deep enough to get an elephant to drown in a pool of his own tears. Unfortunately it was extremely short, had clunky controls at times, and the story left you with more unanwsered questions than an SAT. 8.5/10 definite good buy.",

First thing, I'd like to say that I was skeptical, to say the least, about the 'turn' system implemented in this game. Upon playing Transistor I was pleasantly surprised. Don't let the idea of the turn fool you, this is a fast paced game and you will find yourself implementing 'turn' with joy time and time again, I know I did. I think SuperGiant games is starting to become a studio I'll follow. While feeling INCREDIBLY similar to Bastion (you can definitely tell this was done by the same studio: the narrator is the same voice actor, the music is scored by the same person, the challenges share similar ideas to those implemented, and the main character stay [mostly] silent), the game establishes it's own differences, even if rather minor, in the art of the game. SuperGiant has a way of using overall theme in their games so far, and it shines here:  The narrator is as charismatic as ever, the visuals are abosutley stunning and keep the painterly feeling that was present in bastion, and the soundtrack is absolutely breathtaking.  If the theme of bastion was the Wild West, the theme of this is definitely Jazz Noir with a twist of dystopian future. The game doesn't exactly hold your hand either. The story isn't exactly minimalist, yet while you are being fed information on the city, enemies, or events, it never feels spoon fed.  I could go on and on about this game, but really I don't want to spoil to much. I say if you are reading these reviews, take the dive.

I was sucked into the story, so much it was one of those games where I was like ' I don't want to play to much because I know it will end soon' so I would take a break then have to go back ASAP.  Overall this was a wonderful experience, so glad that I purchased it. Deserves all the praise it has gotten, in the running for one of my top games of 2014.  If you have any interest in playing it, and 20.00 is reasonable for a 7hr game plus replay value, then buy it now.",

            "review_text": "So after some time with the game, getting to know its in's and out's, I'm changing up my review to reflect on some things I find lacking with the game's design.  TLDR version: With a heavy heart I give this game a 7.5 out of 10. While the atmosphere, soundtrack, voice work and overall idea of the game are top notch, there are some conflicting designs within the game that are just too glaring to let slide. The good news, the game could make a small patch TOMORROW if they cared to, that would fix these issues and bump the game up to a 10/10 in a heartbeat.  First issue. I dont lke the idea that when you die, you lose skills. What this translates to in game is if I die, I pause the game and hit 'retry' immediately. It would be nice if there was a toggle in the options menu to make this the norm. This is more a nitpick which doesn't bring the game's score down, but still a minor inconvenience.  Second: I'm not a fan of one of the 'limiters' being a removal of 'memory' for putting more skills in. The game should get harder as you as a player find more tools and cominations to meet that challenge. Indeed the rise in difficulty should be an impetous for the player to put more and more things together to overcome thsoe challenges. When a challenge is, 'Hey, you now get less tools to work with, k?' then what happens is very degenerative gameplay where the metagame now shifts to: 'Find the most memory efficient set of skills to break the game mechanics for this fight.' The answer to said question 9.9 times out of 10 is, 'Perma stun, always perma stun'. Remove the limiter and replace it with something more interesting. Fix this and the game is an 8 out of 10.  Third: If the second weren't bad enough on its own, a new limiter called 'Permanence' pops up. Firstly, a warning that it stays in effect EVEN WHEN TOGGLED OFF would be awesome, just awesome. But now consider the following 3 things: The fights in this game change drastically to the point that what 'breaks the game' for one fight is utterly useless for another. Due to my second issue, you have terrible memory and thus only have access to one cookie cutter build at a time. In new game plus, overloaded skills stay overloaded for ? time, and uninstalling a skill to change builds uninstalls a skill. What? Giving the limiter a warning would bump you up to an 8.5.  Also consider that you now get 'copies of skills' in NG+ which can fundamentally alter your builds. To make use of them, you have to uninstall skills to make room evven without a memory shortage. The entire way this game is designed is just not consistent with the idea of permanent skills, at least not unless you're max level and have enough memory to make a well balanced build. Maybe make it a thing for a challenge mode or something? This change wouldn't effect rating, since I could always attempt to turn off my 'must play game on hardest mode OCD' and just turn it on at the end of the game, but it would be nice nonetheless.  Fourth: Your entire NG+ system is broken. So here' my current situation in game currently. I deleted all my skills just to see how many the game would let me delete. Turns out I can't delete less than 3. The 3 I hafve are useless and thus can't progress past the fight I'm on. The 'Reset progress' option doesn't start me at the beginning of NG+ with all my skills, it starts me back at the beginning of the entire original playthrough. How about no? Your design philosophy was to be respectful of player's time, and most of the game thus far has been. This, however, is a huge oversight. As far as making the game remember what skills you started out with after the last boss fight, how about we make that irrelevant. Just when enterring NG+ for the first time and every subsequent time via restarts, make the 'Prepare yourself!' message pop up so you can pick your skills and get moving. There, problem solved. Fix this, and even if you FIXED NOTHING ELSE, I'd bump this game up to a 9.5 out of 10.  Other than these large gripes, my main general gripe is that most attacks are too slow outside of Turn(). More or less half of my skills get relegated to 'upgrade or passive' status because they're more of a liability to use in harder battles than anything else. Some general TLC for attack animations for some skills would go a long way.",

It's all about the mood - the humming, the colours, the spotlights, the show posters, the news terminals. The way Red writes comments and sometimes uses them to talk to her lover, who's right next to her, because that's the only way she CAN do it - that's a trifle (just one of many) that plays really well into the whole picture. It's a kind of melodic despair, a sweetly aching melancholy.  Get the soundtrack. It's as much part of the story as anything else, Ashley Barrett's voice a flashback to just before the game begins, when Red still had hers.  Combat... well, it's there. You can whack 'em in real-time, Diablo-style, or you can plan your moves for maximum tactical efficiency - the game has a built-in 'challenge mode' for all styles. The system where you use skills as upgrades for other skills, or as separate passive skills, is interesting. But again, it's all about the mood and the story here - because every skill is a person, and you learn their story by using the skill in various ways.  The game is horribly short, but I get the feeling that it's exactly long enough. Sometimes a short story should be a short story. It shouldn't be sold for the price of a whole book, though.",

            "review_text": "It's difficult for me to write a review of this game. See, I bought it out of a passionate love for Supergiant Games that came forth from playing their first game, Bastion. Now, as this was my motivation, I think it's fair to speak it in terms of its merits relative to the game that caused me to purchase it. Overall, I say that I recommend the game, but that it isn't worth the money for the amount of gameplay you get.   Visuals:  As in Bastion, the artwork was stunning. In fact, this is the main element in which Transistor far surpasses Supergiant  Games's first title. Nowadays, it's difficult to find a truly beautiful game that also plays relatively well. In Transistor, the city of Cloudbank is beautiful, filled with bright lights and dark shadows, each skyline and city street more breathtaking than the last. This was the most impressive aspect of the game, in my mind.   Audio: Again like Bastion, the audio was excellent. However, for a game whose main character is a singer (even though she has lost her voice), I saw very little focus on the musical aspect of the game. Unlike in Bastion, where I found myself seeking out and listening to the music after playing the game, I was not captivated. I was disappointed by this, but still found the music to be very enjoyable. I wish that you had the option to listen to the music you unlocked outside of the enclosed zone (that would've been very nice).   Gameplay: This is the part that most disappointed me. I saw a lot of good ideas in terms of combat in Transistor. The ability to place any skill in a primary, secondary, or passive slot allowed for a lot of different and interesting builds. The idea of the Turn() was pretty cool, as well. However,    it made the boss battle a Dragonball-Z like turn-based battle, and    I always found myself flailing around after using it, avoiding conflict until it recharged, then immediately using it again. This was not fun for me. It had a couple of good ideas, but some of them were poorly executed, leading to an unsatisfactory combat experience.   Story: I'm kinda on the fence about this. The characters seem interesting, but again, in relative terms, it wasn't as good as Bastion. There was not enough detail given. In bastion, the story revolved around a core of a small number of characters, who were characterized by their actions and reactions to objects and events. You were told enough to keep you on your seat, keep you guessing, and keep you invested. The characters seemed to matter. With Transistor, I only cared about the two main characters, and not as much as I did with Bastion. Again, disappointment is the main feeling. They could've done better.  Value:  I don't think the game is worth the cost. I spent $15 on about 4 actual hours of gameplay (I had 6 on record because I left it open to go eat), which is not okay. Most $60 games offer at least 1 hour of gamplay for each dollar spent. I felt cheated, to be frank. I had fun, but it wasn't worth it. I'd recommend playing it, but perhaps not purchasing it.",

These abilities can be combined with one another to create new hybrids of abilities which extends the life of the game's combat system dramatically. The story is told as you explore with a handful of minimalist cutscenes thrown in which showcase the 2d art style. Understanding the story requires the player to pay careful attention to dialogue and explore the environments for context.  The game is about 6 hours long and may be repeated in New Game+ (Recursion Mode) to continue acquiring abilities and attempt more difficult combat challenges. A repeated playthrough is also recommended to see the story through again with the context given to you by the initial playthrough. This is the kind of game they have long articles written dedicated to piecing together what was really going on in the game's story, without being the kind of game that you'll find yourself completely confused by if you choose not to engage in the larger conversation happening around the game's opening and ending.  $20 is a steal.

The soundtrack is also incredible and perfectly fits the game.  The gameplay is something that I have never played before. You have the option of fighting as an action game, which works well against small enemies. However, against tougher enemies, you will be killed easily fighting this way. Instead, you use a system called functions where you stop time and plan out what moves you will use.

The depth for the moves comes from the fact that each skill/move you learn can be assigned to either one of you your 4 slots, your passive, or as a modifier to another move (up to 2 for each slot) you have assigned to you main slots; I can not stress how much depth this gives and I barely scratched the surface for all the cool combos you can set up in my one play through. This combat system is quite fun, and the game does of great job keeping combat engaging, and the setting is cool and intriguing over it's 6-8 hour play through. This is a must play. ",

It's still a very good game, just like it's big brother Bastion. Good graphics, good sound, good gameplay (warning ! this is tactical-RPG, not action-RPG). And one good thing I like with the end :   Red kills herself. I'm not a sadist, but I'm sick of deus-ex-machinas and happy end after a sad story. It enhances the consistency, and that can't be a bad point imo.  ",

Still, it's hard to do anything but laud SuperGiant's ambition. This is a beautiful game, with amazing music to boot. Also, it's honestly fun to play, with a pseudo-strategy bent and a focus on mixing-and-matching abilities creatively. Sometimes I just turn it on and play around in test rooms, which is really an achievement for such a story-oriented game.

Transistor is a demanding game even in the short time you need to play through it, and not simply for its technical challenge.

        },
        {
            "review_text": "For the vast majority of people, the chief reason why they would be eyeing up Transistor is summed up in seven letters: its predecessor, Bastion. For those not in the know, Bastion was a single-player action-slanted RPG with a unique art style and interspersed with shades of gameplay reminiscent of the classics of old.  Of course, when one thinks of Bastion, the name which almost always gets thrown into the same or adjacent sentence is one Logan Cunningham. Taking the role of Rucks, the game's narrator, the man's dulcet tones interspersed the gameplay with comments and references with all the near-omniscience of a storyteller. Even when you made a mistake and died, Rucks would backspace his own retelling of the tale, mentioning that 'that wasn't what happened at all'. It was the stand-out jewel in the crown of an already good game.  In Bastion's successor, Transistor, Cunningham makes a return as the leading voice, though not the game's leading role, just as he was before. This time around, he takes on the role of the near-sentient sword wielded by Red, the game's wordless lead. Like Rucks, the sword offers comment on the happenings around it but, by being a companion on the journey as it happens, his insight is more present-tense than omniscient. With the differences between Rucks and the sword, you'd be forgiven that they weren't voiced by the same man, which certainly helps to kick the game's vocal prowess up a few notches.  Unlike in Bastion, Cunningham isn't the sole voice actor. This time, the antagonists have voices of their own and, while they get nowhere near as much microphone time, they do well to avoid seeming excessively overshadowed, saying their piece and playing their respective parts as and when needed.  Anyway, enough fawning over the voices. It's the game that's important here. Transistor's aesthetic pulls just about every trick in the book to distance itself from its predecessor and, in addition to succeeding, the act of doing so allows it to stand alone. Where Bastion was a brightly lit fantasy world, Transistor takes place in the darkened, almost desolate near-modern city of Cloudbank, emphasising the deserted dystopia in which Red resides.   For the majority of the game, your only interaction with people who haven't become a disembodied voice in a sword are through faceless computer terminals, into which Red enters comments to various state-moderated news posts. While other games would have simply had the character type in a snarky one-liner to give a middle finger to the establishment, Transistor shows Red second (and even third) guessing herself as she types, often deleting a subversive message for something more unassuming, yet still expressing concern; a nice way to offer depth to a woman who can't speak.  Combat-wise, Transistor plays out a lot like Bastion, albeit with some twists thrown in for good measure. While 'The Kid' in Bastion had an array of weapons with which to dispatch foes, Red only has her sword. To make up for it, the variety comes instead in the form of abilities which are acquired - with limited scope for which are taken when - and can be used, either as direct attacks, modules to upgrade the primary attacks or equippable passive items which convey certain benefits, leading to the ability to give Red configurable loadouts.   Do you augment Crash with Breach in order to give it a longer reach? Or do you flip the two around to give Breach a stunning effect? Do you equip Help directly to gain a summonable pet? Or do you put it in the passive slot to gain the 25% chance to become a 'SuperUser' whenever you activate the game's Turn function, gaining a one-shot Kill ability which blasts all and sundry with a high-damage ball of fury?  Turn is where Transistor's combat gets a little more interesting. Reminiscent of Vagrant Story, Turn temporarily stops time and allows Red to plan out her movements and attacks, using a limited bar which spans the top of the screen. After everything has been keyed in safely, a single button press starts the flow of time up again, allowing Red to carry out her queued attacks far faster than would be possible normally. Whether its enacting a complex strategy or simply dashing away from splash damage, Turn is quite a versatile and fun system to use which fits well within the game's vaguely sci-fi world. It's one you'll be using a lot, too.  While there are some gripes about the game's length - some people likening it to about the same six-ish hours as the average Call of Duty campaign (on Veteran) - it's certainly a game well worth the look if you enjoyed Bastion, or even if you like RPG-esque games such as this. As for whether it's worth full price, that's where your mileage will vary. Some will find the better part of £15 or 20-something dollars a mite steep for a short title, while others will base their decisions on other factors. Though, with the tail end of the year coming up, it's likely to find itself on sale during the holidays.   If I recall, there's two Steam Sales left in 2014, Hallowe'en and December. And this game's already pretty fair for the price it currently is. Just imagine how appealing it'd be with a chunk off it.",

Normally this is not an issue, but it's annoying during the challenge rooms found in the game. You're given a predetermined loudout of skills in these rooms.

            "review_text": "I'd like to preface this by saying this is lengthy and spoiler free. If you want a more spoiler-dense, but also more critical review, I posted one in the discussion page for Transistor.  I obviously recommend this game, and I would give it a solid 7.5/10.  This game is worth your time, especially if you care far much more about mechanics than story. Now, don't get me wrong...the story is good. Not great, and CERTAINLY not Bastion, but I didn't want to shoot myself in the head playing it. I was just a little disappointed with how the story shaped up compared to its 'big brother,' so to speak.  You're Red, a singer, and she has a sword-thing called the Transistor and something big has happened. That's pretty much all you really know about the plot starting out. If you want to understand what is going on in the world, the backstory is presented in text blocks you get for using abilities in certain ways. I, honestly, was not a big fan of this at all, and will say it knocked this down from being an 8.5 to a 7.5. Sometimes it just isn't practical or desirable to use abilities in ways to unlock some text blocks, and by the end of the game (which, by the way, was just a hair too short for my likings, having paid $20).  Abilities and Turn() are the big mechanics that, to me, are super inspired. You have the option of playing the game in real-time, unleashing one of your four hotkeyed abilities (you have probably 16 or so you can pick from to hotkey) on the fly or, more in line with how the developers were hoping youd play, you can use the Turn() system, which pauses time and turns the game into a strategyish game. You get a certain amount of space to do certain moves (each of which taking different amounts of time) while at the same time planning out where your moves will launch your enemies so your subsequent attacks don't miss. The enemies really aren't ragdolls, before you get that idea, but some moves really can knock 'em out of the park. I love the Turn() system and it really lets you plan out the best way to string together attacks and combos and 'backstabs' for the highest damage bonus.  As I mentioned earlier, the abilities are a big game mechanic beyond the obvious. You have three options for deciding how to use your abilites (each of the ways you use an ability will unlock one of the ability's three backstory texts): Hotkey, Ability Modification, and Passive. You can only ever have four abilities hotkeyed, as mentioned earlier, and you can have up to two modifiers per each hotkey, and up to four passive abilities slotted. Each ability has a different hot key, modifier, or passive use. For instance, Bounce() has a bouncing effect (go figure; jumps from enemy to enemy dealing damage) when used as a hotkey, might cause your hotkeyed ability to have a branching effect when used as a modifier, or gives you a deflector shield that protects you from some damage. I find this extremely cool and really lets you customize your character to be 'yours' because there isn't really one particularly good build that outshines all the others. As you level up, you'll be able to expand your character's ability slots, so when I say 'up to four passives' and such, you have to level up to get those perks.  There exists a challenge system. I personally find it isn't as strong or 'hardcore' as Bastion's, but it does its purpose, increases exp enough to be worth it and also gives you insight to enemies when you use them. You unlock more and more as you level up.  The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic, and the little lady who did the vocals is stellar (she also sang in Bastion). The songs are haunting and really get stuck in your head. It is worth it to buy the soundtrack. So worth it.",

Art can be summarised as feeling new experiences, something niche that produces certain feelings. That´s a bit how I feel about Transistor.  Can´t really say much about the game that hasn´t already been said. It is simply a work of art. Even with all the commotion with the city dissapearing, the Process killing everyone and the entire world coming to an end, I couldnt help but feel that the love story between Red and the man trapped inside the Transistor was one of the driving points. I felt Red´s pain, not being able to talk or see his beloved. I also felt his pain, being trapped and alone. The connection between those two was incredible, both in the excelently realised combat and the wait time in between areas.  That´s why I cried... the ending, not to spoil it, will make you consider to what extent the love to another being can drive us to commit certain actions.

Keep at at it, though, and somewhere along the line - maybe when the ever-increasing number of powers at your disposal takes the possible combinations from 'numerous' to 'infinite', maybe when you realize the entire game is just as compelling played in real time as it is when played turn-based (or vice versa), maybe when you witness the ending - you'll realize one playthrough isn't nearly enough time spent in so entrancing a world.

The intelligent game design is highly engaging, and relies heavily on the player's inteligence in order for you to succeed in the game. There is no tutorial, there is no main menu. You are plunged directly into a confused futuristic city where the digital apocolipse is happening and you are the only one who can stop it. Add on top of that the best game soundtrack I have ever heard (literally better than most modern pop musc) and you've got yourself an amazing game.

The first time I sat down to play it the story and immersion kept me playing it for hours. I didn't want to stop for any reason; I was loath to even go to the bathroom because I thought it would ruin the experience and flow that I was feeling with the game. The game explains very little directly outright and at first I was annoyed by this. But over time I realized that working out both the combat and equipment system as well as the story myself was so much more rewarding and interesting. For me it was a perfect mix of a BioShock-like story and immersion with a very customizable Final Fantasy VII-esque equipment system and a relatively unique combat system. But the best part of this game is that none of these factors are independent. In order to uncover more of the story you need to use your abilities and limiters in different combinations and ways that you otherwise wouldn't think to. In a way you take the role of detective, being told very little but able to find out almost the whole mystery. This also opens up unique ways to play as well. I discovered an awesome CC build that I used for a while because one of the tests in the Backroom forced me to use abilities I hadn't really wanted to but I realized it allowed me to lock down most enemies for a long time.  Gameplay: 9/10 Visual and Audio: 10/10 Story: 10/10  Overall: 9.5/10  Buy it, because I want to see what else Supergiant Games can do.",

In Bastion the world comes together as you play; in transistor, it is devoid of life. Bastion did so much for a narrative, while giving out very little in concrete detail. In fact, the vagueness of Bastion is a hinge in the storytelling mechanism. For Transistor, the story never really comes together. It seems like the wrong lessons were learned from the successes of Bastion.  Transistor's gameplay, in contrast, manages to innovate a fun style of isometric action, adding a little bit of slow-mo strategy and changing up the weapon modding and levelling enough to make it its own. Oh, and it's pretty too.   Transistor's shortcomings are exacerbated by its maudlin and hopeless tone. It's a fun play-through, but lacks personality and diversity.",

            "review_text": "This game is like a computer, A graceful system of components working perfectly in harmony with eachother.   The combat system is mindblowingly well crafted. Every Function() aligns perfectly with one another, Creating a massive number of different combinations and builds. This makes Transistor a very flexible game, you can -very much so- tailor the combat after your own playstyle. Whether you want to be quick and stealthy or damage dealing and tanky, Whether you want to play it in real-time or in turn-based, this game will allow you to do so, every playstyle is viable.  The story is well paced and presented in an intruiging mysterious manner, leaving you to connect the dots yourself. Reading the various logs is important if you want a grasp of what is really going on. Yet the story would be just as enjoyable if you didn't read them, although you would probably be a bit confused as to why some events occured.  The narrative is also carefully woven into the experience as a whole. There's no ludonarrative dissonance here, at least not that i noticed. The combat and things you do all makes sense within the narrative, for example; every Function() acquired is actually a digital 'trace' of a (often deceased) person. and the Function()'s nature reflects who they are (or were in life). The protagonist's trace for instance, is a disruptive stun ability, which reflects her personality as a rebellious musician who often sparks controversy with her lyrics.  This game is simply beautiful, the sound design, the art direction, the graceful combat system, the story, the acting, and all so well put together into what seems to be perfection. Every aspect of Transistor is strong. Much like a supercomputer.  Of course there will be people disagreeing with me. But mostly over things that are subjective. Mechanically and technically the game is near perfection. Most problems people would have with transistor i'd think would be subjective and down to one's individual taste.",

Bioshock games is famous for dialogue choices, and thats their claim to fame. Supergiant games also has a unique signature on the gaming world. Starting with Bastion, they showed a remarkable ability to place in game narration at every turn, with no cutscenes necessary. This creates an incredibly smooth and enjoyable experience for most players.  Unlike bastion, transistor takes a more serious approach on its story. The amount of emotion in this game is just unbelievable, and the perfectly matched music only made the experience far more enjoyable for me. Even transistor's combat has a sense of uniqueness to it, as you can pause combat and line up a set of attacks to strategically defeat enemies, or just run in and smash faces.  I would definitely recomend this game to anyone looking for a new gaming experience, and definitely to everyone who enjoyed bastion. If you enjoy being able to customize abilities, transistor also hits the ball out of the park. Instead of classic stat sheets as many game have, every 'spell' or 'attack' you earn in this game can be attached to other spells to add functionality, or directly attached to your character to create passive improvements to your fights.  Despite any flaws players may find, i find that much less unique, and even blatantly mundane games, often get near perfect reviews online. With that said, giving transistor anything but a 10/10 score would not do it justice.  10/10. I definitely recommend you play this game. It's also free for PS4 Plus users for this month.",

While enemies can be frustrating at times, the game allows you to modify your the difficulty in a dynamic way, similar to Bastion, with limiters and different attack sets, which is a great feature I'm glad they kept. The way the game throws you in at the deep end, leaving you to slowly get a better understanding the of story, world, and characters that surround you drove me on with passionate curiosity and a sense of discovery, and is something I've sorely missed from single-player experiences reacently.

Finally, and some would say most importantly, gameplay. I don't actually know how common this particular type of gameplay is, or if there are any other games that have used it (aside from possibly Bastion, which I will be buying as soon as I finish writing this review). But either way, its execution in this game is flawless. I loved the process of mastering the function combinations and figuring out what worked best, and that unlocking the stories behind the functions themselves encouraged you to use them in different ways and combinations. I also love the fact that the game never feels like the outcome is the result of anything aside from your skill level. I wouldn't call this a puzzle game by any means, but it definitely presents you with problems at times that require a less than direct solution.  TL;DR, this game is perfect, and you should buy it.

            "review_text": "This game is beautiful and has an excellent soundtrack. I wish I liked playing it even a quarter as much as I liked looking at and listening to it.  The combat mechanics quickly become repetitive, and the enemy design is uninspired. The game's system for swapping out your active/support/passive functions has the potential to be interesting, but for me I just ended up being disorienting as the effects of pressing the controller face buttons were constantly changing.  Overall the gameplay was a real dissapointment to me. It tries valiantly to stradle the action-oriented style of combat from Bastion with a more tactical style of combat from something like XCom. Sadly, I feel like it ends up just failing at both. The real-time combat feels mushy and you lack effective tools to avoid damage, while the turn()-based combat feels simplistic. The recharge time between turn()s is irritating and unfun.  Moreover, the constant chattering by the transistor is insufferable. Unlike the genial, pleasant storytelling vibe you got from the Bastion narrator, the transistor seems to speek just to hear his own voice. He reacts to every little thing, and frequently makes little sense. Later in the game, his resigned, grimdark commentary gets very old.  Finally, the story is much too disjointed to take seriously. It tries to evoke the sense that Cloudbank is a malliable (digital?) world and that the Process are destroying it utterly; but we don't have enough context to emote with the characters, relate to their plight, or even to understand what is happening to their world that is so catastrophic. The antagonists are a shadowy conspiracy with vague, unexplained goals; we know they have committed hubris primarily because the story template demands it. Red is a protagonist who litterly cannot speak, and the Transistor is a cipher who is also an incessant chatterbox. Your only insight into their relationship is spoken by the Transistor and is the embodyment of 'tell, don't show.' The 'dramatic' climax at the end of the game feels totally unearned; the player has no agency in it and it is actually sort of difficult to even tell what event has transpired.  If you enjoy the combat system in this game then the art and music are more than enough to carry the weak story. Sadly, I found the gameplay to be the weakest aspect in this package.  Verdict: listen to the Transistor soundtrack and buy another copy of Bastion instead.",

Everything in this game is beautiful: art style, soundtrack, game mechanics, you name it. The history is kinda hard to follow or to understand the universe in which this game is taking place, first to come to mind is some sort of matrix world but it isn't like it (at least that is what I think xD).  Personally I didn't like Bastion so much (it is probably the first thing to come to mind when you talk about Transistor), but Transistor is the kind of game you fall in love with, and damn the soundtrack (spoiler alert: 'The Spine' omg!) helps a lot into do that xD  This game worth every penny, and actually I feel bad for buying it when it was on discount, but at least I can't recommend enough this game, really, it is a MUST in your library, and you probably will end writing a review about this game too, when you are invaded by that heartbreaking feeling when you finish an awesome game.

Supergiant games promised 'If Bastion was our take on fantasy, Transistor will be our take on Sci-Fi' and they delivered completely, with their original and rich style of story-telling, art and music. An absolute beautiful thing to behold, It feels like this game was made just for me. Transistor now ranks as one of my favourite games of all time. Though I sing its praises, mechanically, some may be at odds with the Turn() system. Though cueing up attacks allows satisfying elements of strategy, once your Turn() has been spent, you are left to run around powerless until it returns. A small gripe in another masterful piece of art. Just listen to that soundtrack.",

On the other hand, I found the story aspect both disappointing (especially the ending) and at times annoying. Also it tended to freeze up but that might just be an issue with my computer- it overheated a lot playing this. Basically, good game mechanics and visuals, mediocre story and terrible ending.  One really neat aspect is you can replay the game at the same level you ended at, with different monsters and all that. I'll admit that even though I didn't like the ending, I'm going to replay it just enough to get all my test acheivements completed, because they're kinda fun.    I wish there was an 'eh' option on reviews, but I'll just choose yes, because I wouldn't ANTI-reccomend it? I just also wouldn't rave about it to my friends. But, unable to choose between the two, I'll go with the nice option.   Spoilers ahead.  I'm a bit of an odd duck in that the story aspect of games tends to be what I go for the most and so a story I'm unhappy with is a big minus for me. For this one, I couldn't really get much of a sense of the characters or connect with them. The most characterized is the guy who lives in Red's sword, who is super into her and never shuts up. He seems nice enough, but it's really unclear whether Red even knew him before he sacrificed himself to become a sword?? If she didn't, their whole epic romance deal is even more unbelievable than it already is. Like I said, sword guy seems nice, but it takes a lot of skill to make a romance work when it's just one dude talking and the game didn't really pull it off.  The ending is what disappointed me most- basically, Red commits suicide so she can live in the virtual realm of the sword with sword guy. Like, I fought through this entire game to save and rebuild this town, and now I'm just screwing off to live in a sword. Something I did not at all need to do, because I could have just kept hanging out with him as a sword. Like, we wouldn't be able to make out but I could have taken the sword on little dates. Sit him across from me at restraunts and give him a little sword tuxedo.   Yeah, blablabla epic romance. Romanticizing suicide is always uncomfortable, but it's doubly weird when like, previously in the game two of the villains (heavily implied to be gay lovers) commit suicide and Sword Guy calls them cowards and the little fight narration even marks them as cowards, which was kinda eeesh to begin with. But then the proagonist does it and it's framed as awesome and romantic. So it's only cowardly if you're not the main character I guess? Or if you're doing it for heterosexual reasons? (That's mostly sarcastic, but then again, 3/4s of our villains ARE implied to be gay, in addition to the dudes, we've got a murderous implied-lesbian stalker). Basically, game needs to decide whether it wants to insult or glorify suicidal decisions, you can't have both.   The plot itself was a bit confusing to follow, despite being pretty standard, and aside from sword guy, we mostly know people through their character profiles. I couldn't really connect with anyone, so while it was fun game to play, it's not one I can get invested in. If you don't need to be invested in your games and are okay with going on a whole journey only for the protag to just kill herself, go for it, it's a fine game. But if either of those are red flags for you, don't do it.",

There's an interesting and engaging story and the battles are a lot of fun and not too difficult. World-building is amazing - Cloudbank is a world that will stay with you and find its way into your dreams. And the graphic / UI design on this game is probably some of the best I've ever seen.  I do have issues with the game, mostly with the ending, which I found personally to be incredibly disappointing. I expected a lot more from a game with a female heroine. I expected it to adhere less to patriarchal norms and conventions, but ultimately Transistor didn't do that for me.  Still I think it's definitely worth picking up on a sale. Some people might find it worthwhile at full price - it didn't have enough story for it to warrant full price for me personally.",

This is one of the best examples to date that videogames can be art, and can still be engaging, innovative, and fun to play while pursuing that goal. Personally, I come from the FPS/FPSH genre, so the way this game plays and basic mechanics were totally alien to me, but not only was I able to learn them with relative ease, I found them to be very engaging, and the game ups the difficulty at all the right moments to keep the gameplay challenging. I reccomend it to anyone, even those of you who get a hard-on every May/June when the next Call of Duty is anounced.  But for real though, you may find it a little weird if you're not on the up-and-up with white people ♥♥♥♥. Cloudbank is basically cyber-punk Paris; if there was a mass shooting there it would be on the front pages of every major news outlet for weeks, there would be Facebook overlays, a special hashtag (#prayforcouldbank), and then all the underground news sources would freak the hell out about how there's never any major news coverage whenever there's a mass shooting in the cyber-punk cities with brown people.

Very smooth, very nice, and very true to the type of game that it is. When it comes to gameplay visuals as well, every single combination is astoundingly good!! There are hundreds of combinations, and they are all unique to represent exactly what they do. Hit boxes and stuff like that - Spot on! Everything fits, it really does!  Gameplay / Mechanics / Story etc.. 10,010/10. You couldn't ask for more.. The gameplay and mechanics are actually AWESOME!! Like, truelly they make you think how you want to play. Be defensive, all in, etc. You can play hundreds of different combinations of techniques together to create a style you want. There is no 'OP one way of doing it', there are ways to do whatever you want, all whilst still playing to the difficulty that you want. No cheats or cheap tricks, it's all legit awesomeness.  The story is also heart-touchingly good. It unfolds slowly but surely as you go on through the game, ending with true brilliance. I assure you, you will not think otherwise and you will love it! Every single bit of it! The music also fits in perfectly with the world and really pulls you in even closer to the characters involved. Red is potentially the one character out of all games I have had most feelings for regarding her [back]story, and just standing there listening to her hum is worth the full cost of this game.  I can HIGHLY recommend this game. One of the most brilliant indie sci-fi games around with amazing game-flowing mechanics.",

The music alone and the way it is found and accessed throughout the game is entirely new and unseen elsewhere. The fighting system and upgrades is similar to Bastion but also combines rpgs and action games.

Its similarities to Bastion run deep yet it differentiates itself more than enough to stand on its own and everything it does it does well. I guess the world just felt a little more sterile, the story not as immediately penetrable and intensely engaging. I didn't feel like the narrator was talking about what I the player was doing like in Bastion. The chemistry between the two main characters is never really established. It feels super one sided. I mean... she can't speak but I guess that's part of the challenge of the design.  It was fairly short at 9hrs and I didn't feel like I was hugely challenging myself though I only stacked 2 limiters up. Its combat was cool but maybe felt a little bit limp compared to Bastion. I liked planning ahead. I like the RPG elements. I just never felt like a badass and never felt everything flow.  The cyberpunk world of Transistor is beautifully realised. The art style is quite a departure from Bastion's lived-in, beat-up wildlands. Transistor is straight-lines and ordered geometry. Restrained and readily coherent colour schemes. Like Bastion's world unfurled in front of you there's still a sense of jazz in Transistor's aesthetics as you explore its Escher-esque spaces.  The music is some tite ♥♥♥♥ again.  Comparison to Bastion is maybe unfair but natural. The game is definitely worth getting and I am glad Supergiant Games exists and gets ♥♥♥♥ done.",

The music, without a doubt, it great and fitting for the game, I liked humming to tacks in the challenge room while I took a break. The art is great, I loved how it ran at around 60fps on my low end laptop, but I still go the full experience with the beautiful effects and cut scenes. I loved how you could combine moves and mix and match to get awesome combinations, I spent our seeing all of them, and each one differs from the other, and have draw backs too, but I'd live to see that sort of style be implemented in more games, where the player can become powerful through trail and error as well as intuition rather than just levels.   Now we get to the slightly sticky part, I liked the story and people seem to adore it, but it sometimes confused me for too long, it took too long to figure out what was going on, and there were missing pieces I was expected to figure out my self. The story felt random at times, definitely not lazy, but it was hazy, the sort of haze you have at the beginning of a hard hitting drama that starts midway through the story, and at the end it feels like you're still at the beginning of that plot, you get some character development from the extra reading, but most the characters are ones you bare no attachment to, I'd like to see more flashbacks and narration of the story. So All in all it's gets a 8/10 from me, I feel like the 9/10 are from the hipsters who thought the hazy story was a great addition that simpleton could never comprehend, but I'm someone who adores story rich games so finding one with a good set up only to be left semi confused is a valid reason for me to rate it slightly lower.",

            "review_text": "Transistor is a well-made action RPG presented from an isometric perspective. One of the first things you will notice about the game is the gorgeous art direction; the main character and the enemies (called 'The Process') are represented as cel-shaded 3D models that blend perfectly with the 2D backgrounds, which depict the colorful futuristic environments of the game's setting, a city called Cloudbank. The music fits the atmosphere very well, and will change appropriately depending on what kind of a place you're wandering through. Your actions throughout the game will be narrated by your sword, the titular Transistor (or rather, the person trapped inside of it), much like how there was a narrator in Bastion (the developer's previous game). While the narrator's voice can occasionally be difficult to understand due to the sound filtering, the voice acting is still very much on key.  The biggest strength of this game, however, is certainly the deep battle system. Throughout the game, you will acquire 'functions' for the Transistor. These functions can be placed and switched around into various slots to serve three different purposes: adding a new attack, upgrading an existing attack, or adding a passive effect. Each function represents a different type of attack, and you can have up to four. Each of these attacks also has one or two upgrade slots (depending on your progression), where you can attach another function to add its own unique effect to that attack. You can also place a function in a passive slot, which will have a different effect on the player depending on the function; for example, the player may gradually recover health, or all attacks may become stronger. Not only is it very interesting to experiment with the endless amount of different combinations of functions for the Transistor, you are basically forced to experiment because whenever your life bar depletes, one of your attack functions is disabled for the next two save points (you die if you lose all four). This game also has a fair amount of replayablility due to the option to start a New Game+ after you finish, which increases the difficulty and preserves all of your functions and other sorts of progress (including your progress on the bonus challenges, which you will likely not complete in one playthrough).  I would say that the biggest drawback of Transistor is the story. While it can sometimes be interesting, at other times it can be rather difficult to understand what's going on. Maybe some people might think that parts of the story are open to the player's interpretation, but there's a point where this openness to interpretation just becomes a bunch of flat-out plot holes, and unfortunately this is the case in the game's plot. However, I believe that Transistor is one of those games where the story takes a back seat to the gameplay, so this should ultimately be a minor nuisance. This game is definitely worth a purchase, and I'm glad I played it.",

The concept of combat and upgrading abilities is refreshing to play and gives you a lot of freedom... at a first glance. The problem I have with the game is that the vast majority of combinations you can play are apparently useless as you'll die quickly against many enemies if you don't pick one of few strong combos. On top of that, if your health bar is depleted you lose an ability for the next X checkpoints, which is frustratingly punishing as it makes you much weaker for the remaining battle and potentially the next one. Since you don't know what's up ahead, some types of enemies just render you useless and make it a very unrewarding experience. Have a build centered around Load()+Breach(), spawning explosive loads at a distance to trigger them with another ability? Here's three fast melee enemies and a miniboss that pulls you through the level. If you're going to make your combat potentially punishing like this, at least throw in a difficulty setting for people who don't want to spend hours min-maxing in the sandbox to find one of the few viable builds.",

            "review_text": "tl;dr: extensive analysis of the game design. Conclusion on the bottom  So for the most part, I absolutely love this game. I will be breaking this down into the traditional pros and cons, but I will be going into detail about why certain things work and what could have been improved.  Pros + Art + Music + Style + Story + Setting + RPG Mechanics + Gameplay/Battle System  Detail: My focus here will be on the RPG mechanics and the Battle System. This, in my opinion, is some of the most wonderfuly complex and open type of RPG Character Build system I have ever played. Despite the overwhelming beginning (more on that later) the rpg system is incredibly intuitive and deep. Basically, throughout the game, you unlock active abilities called Functions. Each of these functions have three uses: The Active Ability, The Upgrade Ability, and the Passive Ability. And all three are related to the same basic Idea of the function.   The active ability as it suggests is basically using the Function as a skill (pretty straightforward).   The Upgrade aspect is what makes this game so fascinating. Basically, every Function Slot has up to two upgrades that you can insert into an active ability. So the Upgrade aspect of the Function allows you to apply the affect of the ability to ANOTHER Function. This combining of functions makes for incredible ammount of possibilities and this is where the real meat of the game is. Let's say you have a Function called 'Cull' as an active function (a hard hitting attack ability). And then you upgrade it another function called 'Tap' (when you use tap, it siphens health from the enemy). By combing it, now you have a Hard Hitting attack that siphens health. These combinations make for a game that has incredible strategic decision making and incredible bredth of uniqueness to every play style and Build. Everyone has their own combination that is completely unique and effective. The creativity on the Player's side is immense and beautiful. It's almost as if each Function is a different color of paint, and your Character Build is your canvas.  The Passive element of a Function is just as straightforward as the Active element. It gives you a passive bonus. For example: If you take the fucntion Tap (as previously mentioned) it will give you a steady health recovery.  This system is balanced in a way where there are incredible amounts of diversity and effective builds. I have never seen two similar builds. And the game encourages expermination, as it unlocks more lore for each function as you use it in a different way. The only possible issue I have with this RPG system is what I'll go into now, and that's how it is introduced to the player.  Cons: - Pacing of the Story - Pacing of Tutorial - Minimal Level design  - Shorter than it Should be  Detail: The beginning is so poorly paced that it has frustrated many people to the point of dropping the game all together, before it actually gets good. This is because of two major problems: 1. The first 30 minutes of the story. and 2.The manner in which they introduce the gameplay mechanics.  1. Let's start with what's wrong with the story. It's really pretty simple, they don't give you any sort of idea as to what you are actually doing until later. SuperGiant went with a more cryptic Noire style of story telling (which for the most part I love). It's almost like a Tarantino movie in that the story begins to unravel and make more sense the further in you get. It starts in Medius Res and the plot begins piecing itself together by the end of the game which, in general, I love. The problem is that in the beginning, it's far more cryptic than it should be, to the point of not providing the most basic of Player Motivation. They don't state where it is you are actually going or why. Even Dark Souls and Hyper Light Drifter makes the basic goal pretty clear. In this game, you don't find out where you are headed until you are already there. This is improved later in the game, but this makes it very frustrating to get invested right at the onset. If they just had the narrator say something like 'There is a bike at the edge of town, that's our ticket out of here.' Then even that would have been enough.  2. This is in my mind, the biggest problem with the game and the largest barrier to entry. The tutorial sucks. With how complex this game can get, they definitely front load the player and overload you with way too much information way too quickly. I have seen this (combined with the early difficulty of the game) turn people away. The issue is that they give you 5 Functions very early on and just sort of throw you in. They explain the basics of the combat, but with all of the Function Combinations and all the depth this game has, 5 skills is overwhelming. That's what? 25 combinations right off the bat? First off, you have to figure out what the hell these Functions even DO, and then the amount of combinations is staggering. You get the feeling that you have no idea what you are doing and your combinations are bad. This is because the Player is still trying to grasp the very unique combat mechanics of the game. This leads to what is essentially decision anxiety. Later in the game, once you get past the learning curve, everything is way more manageable (you get a new skill, read what it does, and immediately know where it will fit in your build). If the tutorial was better paced (giving you three skills instead of 5) and it showcased better how to use the skills separately and then taught you how to combine them, then this initial learning curve would have been overcome within the first 10 minutes (rather than after an hour). After that, any new skills introduced would be more manageable from the get go. I know this sounds nitpicky (and it is), but this very small negative aspect can really kill the game for people that would otherwise love it. It almost did me in, if I'm to be honest, and I love games that throw you in with very little hand holding. I feel like reducing the amount introduced to the player would simply better pace out the game.  My final criticism of the game comes down to its scope. It's small, too small (I'm not talking about story here). Sure it encourages replayability and tons of experimentation, but that's just it: The mechanics of this game are so deep and encourage so much creative experimentation, that the length and size of the game is really smaller than it deserves. You have these small linear hallways that basically lead you from battle to battle until the end. Yes, they are beautiful because of the art and it fits the focused narrative, but this game would have benefited greatly from more complex and labyrinthine level design (more like Metroidvania or Dark Souls). I understand how subjective this criticism is, however I feel this is a pretty valid view on the overall pacing of the game. This is a full on Strategic RPG, but by the time you finally feel confident with your build and you are ready to experiment with other builds, the game is over. Every element of this game encourages experimentation, except for the level design itself. If the game had a more complex design and encouraged exploration, then I feel that it would suit the mechanics much better. It could be filled with secrets that expand on the lore of the world and give you unlockables for playing around with. I dunno, it's a different game philosophy, but I feel like it would be better fit than the purely linear nature of the game. I'm not talking about a 60 hour open world rpg. I'm talking about a 15 hour metroidvania style of world design. The game ran me 9 hours, I just feel like the mechanics deserved more from the level design.   Conclusion: This game is worth it for the rpg mechanics and the battle system alone; but with the addition of beautiful art, incredible music, incredible style, and a setting that will make Cyber Punk fans drool, this game deserves a place in every library.",

            "review_text": "Transistor is Supergiant Games' second title after the amazing thing that was Bastion. With Transistor, it's certain that they really have a knack for creating unique, inspired, and fun experiences.  Transistor is a unique, inspired, and fun experience. It's easily one of the best games I've ever played, but you've heard that a thousand times before.  In Transistor you play as Red, a famous singer who as a result of some rather bizarre circumstances, has lost her voice. She picks up the Transistor, which is a cool sword that talks. Now she goes on this quest to figure out what the hell is going on and to get her voice back. The combat is something like a hack and slash combined with a strategy game. Red can have up to four skills to use, which she can attack enemies with in real time. If you push Space, you can enter Turn(). Turn() is a planning mode where time freezes. Here you can plan out Red's attacks ahead of time and then play them back, coordinating actions to clear out an entire room of enemies in one maneuver, using up portions of the Plan() bar for each action. On the downside, once you finish doing Turn(), you are extremely vulnerable and unable to defend yourself (under most circumstances) until the Plan bar refills again. It's a surprisingly unique system that manages to be enjoyable and holds a sizeable amount of depth. There are 10+ different 'Functions' you can get throughout the game, but they can be used as upgrades, passive effects, or abilities all on their own. The idea of being able to freely mix and match these abilities in nearly infinite combinations makes for a variety of gameplay styles and really brought out the inner mad scientist in me.  The story itself, while seemingly very simple to begin with, evolves to become rather complex. The Transistor talks to Red throughout her quest, sometimes about mundane things, sometimes about their situation. It serves a much different purpose than Rucks did in Bastion. Where Rucks was more of a narrator, to give insight on the world and set the mood for the story, the Transistor is more of a companion. By the end of the game, the Transistor felt like as much of a companion to me as it did to Red. You get insight into the world and Red as a character through what it says, and your interactions with it and the things around you are how the story unfolds. The way everything comes together is great and really left me satisfied with it all playing out the way it did. The story is not as straightforward as Bastion, however - to get a good understanding of all the plot elements you have to piece a lot of information together that's being given to you, and even the most subtle bits of dialogue may prove vital to comprehension. It's ultimately a very interesting tale in which I found myself getting pretty damn emotional about. For those who want to learn more, each Function is associated with a certain person in Transistor's universe, and by examining a Function after using it, you can learn more about some of the characters. This isn't integral to the story but it is a lovely and interesting extra for the people who seek it.  What should be mentioned is that the presentation is absolutely gorgeous. The UI is dripping with a neat modern tech feel, and the world has a beautiful abstract futuristic-noir aesthetic. It was so nice to see and the colors and effects in combat really popped. The soundtrack is a massive part of the experience aswell - I don't really know my genres, but I do know that it's good. It all adds to the atmosphere, and a particularly amazing touch is that using Turn() causes the song currently playing to be replaced by Red humming the melody.    Key Points",
