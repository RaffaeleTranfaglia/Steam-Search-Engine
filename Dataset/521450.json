            "review_text": "This was surprisingly well done.  I would like the dev to know I very much enjoyed this. I love games with atmosphere and this definitely had it.  There are a few things I'd personally recommend changing from my fellow developer standpoint: -Increase movement speed by about 10% - you walk very slowly -Increase footfall pace by about 20 points because you move slightly off track with the sound effect -Look into the notes appearing - sometimes they just don't pop up so it kills the atmosphere and kills the story -Make the statues pathfinding a bit better -Add a bit more to make the environments when you're just walking for minutes at a time -There are a few typos but that may be because the developer isn't native speaking English  I really enjoyed this and found it to be very entertaining. I did beat it in less than 2 hours but it was worth the money. I can see a lot of time was put into this and the developer cared about how the game looked. It felt like it was professionally done, even though it was so short.  I don't let engines sway my opinion on games since I personally have made some pretty impressive things with very basic tools. (I've been told that, I'm not patting myself on the back) I think this developer has done that too. It's the little things that really stood out to me like how well the environments were made, the sound effects, the cutscenes, and even down to the flash light sound effect. Most of the gameguru games are pretty bad like rpg maker games but this was very well done.  I think the gameguru community could learn a lot from the dev of this game.  8/10  Also: I've never heard of geocaching until this game. I knew about the concept but didn't know it was an actual thing. I actually want to try this in real life. I've always been an outdoorsman and a survivalist and I love things like camping, hiking, etc. This whole thing actually inspired me to look it up in my area and found that it's actually quite popular. (I live in the country so there are a lot of areas to explore) I think I'll try it, but I'd definitely go packing heat. Not blankets either. Thank god I live in a pro gun state.",
