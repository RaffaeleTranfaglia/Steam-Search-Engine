There have been reported problems getting this game to install or run all over the forums, and while I didn't encounter any of the installation problems, even the proposed solutions to getting the game to launch don't work for me.  As such this is a thumbs-down, but mostly as a warning that the game may not work at all for you! 'Tested' on 64-bit Windows 7.",

I have looked up this problem on forums and the only soution is to turn off any battle animations, which ruins the games excitment a little. The game to me is broken and if your thinking of purchasing...I would not, which is sad, because I really like this style of game",
