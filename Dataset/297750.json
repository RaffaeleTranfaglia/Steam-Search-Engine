            "review_text": "Some history:-  As time went on and sequels were released for the original Close Combat so to did the maps get ever bigger. Around the time of Close Combat 4 the map size reached a point where the AI began to act odd. This was because the AI was never really adapted for the now giant high resolution maps. The result was they began to cluster in one corner, essentially covering an area that was once the size of an entire map but is now just a small part of one large map. This was not fixed in 5. It was not fixed in remake of CC 3 or the remake of CC 2. It is not fixed in this one.   A great game in multiplayer where the AI is not an issue but basically broken for singleplayer.",

I don't regret buying it, and I will get my moneys worth from the game, but $35 is 3 times what it should be sold for.  Thumbs up because its still a great game, and I have more money than sense. If it seems to steep, go dl the earlier versions for free.",

You can rename units if you like and it's easier to select and deselect your choices within a more regimental structure.  The user interface is modernized allowing you to ctrl-group units and choose which elements you would like on your HUD and where you want them on screen. The graphics and soundsa are upgraded as well.  Combat resolution is different. Truce is still there but there is not rout button that I've found. The games last longer and the maps feel larger. Improvements all around.  Finally, the campaign map has an entire system of movement and action selection (rest, reinforce, move, attack) that helps tie the campaign together and makes the game less rail-roady.  ",

It is nothing like it. Pathfinding is a joke. Everything moves really slowly and 'hacky'. Even scrolling isn't smooth even on a modern computer. Also it's really expensive. At $5 or lower might be worth a purchase bot not otherwise.",

Same PC same software. It must have patched or sometihng automatically. In this case it was not cheap so i really am hacked off with this  hence the review.  The close combat genre of squad level wargames were unique and have not really had an equal even after all these years. Closest thing to the Squad Leader type of board game.  A real let down.",

            "review_text": "It's good, but it's a little buggy on my usually stable rig. Gameplay is similar to A Bridge Too Far, the last Close Combat game I played, and this is a good thing. Really, this is what I like about these games - the realistic battles that require some degree of actual skill to succeed at.  The map editor feels awkward compared to the older style, but seems like it allows much better campaigns to be developed once you get the swing of things. Infact, there is a whole new campaign design to it, albiet one I don't personally find overly interesting.  Favorite new stuff: New additions such as long distance mortar and artillery support are kinda neat. There are lots of little tweaks and stuff to the same units, and a bunch of new ones. Quite a few UI updates.   Least favorite new stuff: As I say, I'm not a fan of the new campaign setup beyond the above mentioned parts. I might just not be great at it, but it's really too restrictive to feel like a proper grand strategy element. It feels like you need to replicate the actual events of the battles depicted to actually succeed in most of the campaigns, which is not great when you're a pretty casual WWII history buff like me.  Also, they seem to have removed the ability to see LOS during deployment, something I remember being in A Bridge Too Far, and really a ♥♥♥♥-er of many otherwise good plans. Perhaps it's a realism thing, but I think a real MG team would notice if they were setting up facing directly into a a slight bump that would completely block their line of sight.  Summing it up, I am a mixed on it because I think A Bridge Too Far does just as good a job of the parts that I enjoy. Maybe even does it a little better, really. If you somehow have a working copy of A Bridge Too Far, you might want to check out some gameplay videos of the grand strategic mode to see if it's your thing before dropping $40 on it.  Dunno if it's worth $40 if you have a working copy of Bridge Too Far, but it's the game you expect, for sure.",
