There are players who have been here for years but im enjoying the grind and the variety. Its pretty much kill this and train for the next level. But you do have to wait for rested time otherwise exp gains are ineffecient. No harm in trying and dont be afraid to ask for help!",

            "review_text": "Ok. I really should have known better.  This game ... Have some issues, lets put it this way.  You start your magical journey, creating YOUR character (picking one random hideous face, out of 4 (from 300+), and one random hideous background (same way). You can change 4 of the images you choosing from (randomly), but 'smart interface decisions' are just starting.  You also should pick one of like 20 classes (standard battle types, mages, etc., and even traders, vampires and angels). I am jumping slightly ahead, but all it changes - one active/passive ability and like + or - 10-20 % to speed of learning particular skill groups (battle, defensive, magick or recovery).  Then you appear in world (like a square) and take small 'tutorial', wich shows you main game loop. It goes like this: You go to some 'region' (by clicking) once or several times. on 'global map'. You fight some monster (stat check). (Click auto atack and wait). (If you will try to be 'mage' - you just need more clicking) You collect 'loot' - some more clicks. You manage inventory space and bring 'loot' back to town. You exchange loot from monsters to skill exp. Rinse and repeat.  On town square (all game is bunch of global square grid) - you click several times to get 'quest' - Kill 5 mobs of collect 5 'bear asses', or kill obligatory 'boss' of region (meatsponge that hit hard). You get more exp, when you done.  Of cause there are some equipment options, with depends on you skill levels and wealth.  And there are like 200+ skills... Good right?  Actually not. You see - all skills can be leveled in two ways. - Active and passive. Active - you choose which particular skill to level (lets say parry), and all exp, you get in its dirrectory (defence) goes to this skill. How do you get the exp? By 'burning' monster loot at 'church'.  There are monster loot for combat skills (mele / archery / defence / pets). There are monster loot for magic (white+green / black / blue)  What about crafting skills? Well - you can craft. Theoretically. Or you can just pick this skill to 'passive' leveling. What passive leveling? You might ask. Oh, it is qute simple.  You pick one (of 100+) skills, and it just slowly grows each second. Even when you are offline. How the hell they will ballance that? You may ask (case there are PvP in game). Oh - very very simple.  Skills do like + 20% to this, or that. At level 100. And +10% at level 0.  To give you most hilarious (for me) example - skill to 'raise up' my 'class proficiency'. My class was adventurer.  At level 0 of 'class proficiency' I get swooping +3% to all exp I get. If I will pick this skill to passive leveling, in mere year, or so, (standart geometric progression in exp, required to level up skill with each of it 100+ levels), I will get ... + 6% to all exp. Neet, right?  Lets talk about biggest 'bugbear' I found, and finish with this topic. Remember how I did say, that there is 'merchant' class? Well - you simply can't sell anything on the auction, if you don't pay devs 'monthly'. People said, that later in game I can buy this 'pass' with ingame money.  I can. It costs millions (at auction at least).  Why this is a big deal? Because of 'Crafting' part of the game.  You essentially need to create 'living production lines', from people, to craft even simplest of thing. And each step will take inventory space and particular skill proficiency.   Example: You killed first boss and got fishing rod. You fished some fish (each attempt, after random battle), and want to do something with it. You can sell it to NPC shop, for like 4 gold.  You can buy a fish skinning dagger and get fish scales, getting + exp in fishing, and then sell them to NPC. You can use fish to make oil (dont know how though).  You can't sell this to people, that are noobs, case they came to 'play for free'. You can't sell this to 'old guys', case they dont need stack of 5 fish scales, from starting location. Your only option - is to sell it to NPC, or just destroy it (case it takes space)  Example №2 You want to craft anything 'from other end'.  You get any 'recipie' - lets say lvl 0 harpoon, from buying it at town, and breaking it apart. You cant even see materals, needed to produse it, case first you need to do - is to make 'working copy' of this 'master recipie', which requires you to get pen (NPC sells it), and also ink, and paper. Of course there are different professions, to produse bouth of this, and I dont even know in which city NPC sells 'tools', to level them (not in first 2, I can tell you for a fact).  Did I mention, that all this information I got, pestering people is chat, and reading forums, case game does not explaing sh*t?  Only possitive thing I can say - 'old' people in chat are super chill and nice, but it is, in no way, a game fault.  Try it 'for free', tread with care, and watch for youself.",
