When the scene turns to night it really gets beautiful.. just wow :) reminded me a little bit of avatar with the flying rocks and the glowing plants at night.  I just love it and wish to see more :)",

As such if they can get it running better I would give it a positive review but at the moment I cant really use it as a demo for friends so I will need to request a refund.   But I do like the idea and art work so if they can optimize it to run better and add in a little more interaction I would happily change my review.",
