            "review_text": "You hear much talk lately about the cRPG revival and I’m fairly confident that The Age of Decadence will come to be counted favorably among that swell and deservingly so. But I don’t think it's enough to just say that we have here another good revival title. Though it's look and feel will be familiar to fans of the genre, The Age of Decadence strains so impressively against the reins of what we have come to expect from a game that it may just land us at the leading edge of new territory.  Sure, all of the staples are here. Nice isometric view graphics paint the adventure around you...check. Stat and skill based character creation allowing for a nice variety of playstyles...check. Compelling storyline with strong writing...check. Immersive world lore...check. A world crafted specifically for revealing it's secrets to you as it builds your character into a world saving hero and providing you with believable illusions of consequence...che……..no. No. The world reveals nothing to you for free. You are not a hero or a special snowflake. And you are not pampered by mere illusions of consequences to your choices. You are served very real consequences. And that’s a special thing.  The Age of Decadence provides a wonderfully immersive world. And it respects the player enough to not bend that world’s consequences in a way that favors our character. It's a harsh place full of backstabbing, intrigue, and power plays. And the game says, hey player, act as you want and I will show you what happens to a character like yours when they do those things. If you play the role well you may find that you excel in your ventures. Play the role poorly and you'll quickly discover that you’re just another subpar assassin or merchant that gets to die in the gutter like all of the other hack jobs out there whose aspirations outweighed their qualities.  The decisions are tough. Make an ally here, create an enemy there. The narrative consequences that unfold due to your actions and choices are, to my knowledge, unparalleled in gaming. And Age of Decadence does something really fascinating. You WILL NOT see all there is to see in one play through and that is because each faction/alliance playthrough is served it's on unique view into the story that is unfolding. Honestly, I am not one to replay cRPGs but The Age of Decadence compels you to do so. There’s almost a Butterfly Effect in that as you explore these parallel story lines you get to see just how consequential your actions were when you served that other factions interests.   There are many ways to play the game but however you play it, you'll want to stay true to that character concept. If you’re a smooth talking merchant that’s avoided physical conflict your whole life honing your silver tongue, then exercise all of the caution that character would when things look like they could get physical. The game isn’t going to coddle your poor decisions. Get in the head of that character and respect the world around him or her in the same ways that they would. Playing a talker, you will learn very little about how combat works. Play a physical character and you will be playing a whole new game as you plumb the depths of the rewarding combat system.   The Age of Decadence won’t be for everyone. It's unforgiving nature will be a downer for some. But if you like the idea of real choice and consequences, richly written dialogue and plot, and a gritty brutal setting...then you owe it to yourself to give it a try. And there’s a demo, so try that first!",

            "review_text": "A great and unique RPG. The closest thing I can think of are those CYOA gamebooks, or a western version of Way of The Samurai, with a complex turn-based combat on top.  The complete opposite of Skyrim - where even a dumb orc can be Archmage of Winterhold -, Age of Decadence presents a coherent and realistic world, where you must weight your decisions carefully, based on your strengths and weakness. This is the first game that when thugs asked me for a toll to get through a street, I actually payed instead of just killing them all, because even one thug could easily kill my merchant.  It's a dangerous world out there, not a pandering power-fantasy like most RPGs, and you'll have to use all your skills just to stay alive, and even more to actually succeed. Sometimes backing away from a tough fight, or walking away empty-handed will be your only escape from a gruesome death.   Obviously it's not a game for everyone, but those looking for a challenging game that doesn't threat you like a baby will be more than pleased. It's hard to take other RPGs seriously after playing Age of Decadence.",

            "review_text": "I've only played the release version, but am having a grand time. The simplest comparison to gameplay I can think of is Fallout 1. Turn-based combat, skill-checks in dialogue and encounters, and an in-depth weapon/targeting system. To be clear, this game has MORE depth in skill-checks and weapon/targeting than Fallout 1 did. This is not a copy of things gone by, but an improvement and expansion on some of the ideas.   The character screen forces lots of choices on you, and it is refreshing to NOT be able to do everything with your PC. If this kind of gameplay sounds fun to you, then wholeheartedly recommend.   Obligatory 'bugs' warning/comment: I have not encountered any bugs at all in 10 hours of gameplay. I know, it is almost unheard of in this day and age, but true.",

            "review_text": "Alright, this game is good.  Now to break down the Good of this game to mine Subjective Opinion.  -Good Points- *A classical RPG with large tatical elements in how you position your lone character. It is very viable to move your character around, especially to figuring out attack ranges and AP costs. If done right, you can dance around the enemies. *Mutliple Arching Story paths that can drastically change the end game. Not kidding, most of the paths can and will alter and jump you from plot point to plot point. *Character is set in stone - true changing of the stats, character has a base set of stats made at character creation - FYI, it is insanely to impossibly hard to winning a game with a character having 4 across the board. *Option Settings are quite literally diverse.  !Conclusion of Good Points - This game is meant for those engrossed in exploring and learning a world and it's mechanics. Combat has multiple paths and even wily merchant type characters can do a good job.  -Bad Points- *Difficulty is this games name. Death is sudden and brutal and for casual perps this will end their run and make them refund the game. Why is this bad? Because the casual's are yanking their money away from the company and steam. Removing support for a wellmade game. *Clunky poisoning system. It is hard to poison whole sets of throwing or missile weapons. I do not know if this is intended or not, but it makes it hard to poison 20 throwing knives. *Armor Penalty, there is no amazing fancy set of awesome looking armor that only benefits. One must choose between armors that look awesome but weigh you down or being a dodge fanatic.  !Conclusion of Bad Points: I had a stupid hard time to give bad points and honestly believe the ones I put up are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Anyhow, Casual RPGers will either love or hate the game.   TLDR: Game is gud. Spend your money after taking a look at videos and other reviews. Do not buy solely after this review.",

            "review_text": "This game is hard, especially the combat is punishing. It is easier to play the charismatic talker than the big brute. You will die, die die die die. If you go for the brutes way and on that way you end up out numbered aswell. There is no permanent companions here.   The game might have a pretty ugly engine but it got its own charm and the setting itself is interesting, deep lore and all. I truely recommend the game to fans of old RPGs, turnbased RPGs or people who want to play something more deep than Skyrim when it comes to story and RPG mechanics.   Plenty of things to do, plenty of things to play and who do not want to play in a Roman Empire inspired Empire who fallen in a war and it is now a post-apoc fantasy setting with many hidden secrets and ruins from before the collapse of the imperials. Many left overs fighting in the rubble for control.  Try it, Buy it!",

            "review_text": "Age of Decadence is one of the longest RPG in the making by a small and dedicated team (Iron Tower Studio). I remember reading about him about 9-10 years ago and since them I've waited for it to release. The game is set in a post apocalyptic roman empire like world and features turn based combat and lots of C&amp;C.  When starting the game you receive a warning that this game isn't some fantasy dragon killer simulator. When I first played the demo this year I died on the first quest, because I was stupid and tried to fight someone instead of running away. In this game, with a badly made build you can die easily. The thing that you have to remember though is that this is an Role Playing Game so that if you choose skills/stats related to the selected class (background) the game will be just fine to play. Sure, if you try to be greedy you will get killed if you are not prepared. This means that a change to the way you play this kind of games is required. Like a said above, a bad build is easily made if you don't think about the way a class is played. A merchant maybe should't get into fights and instead should try to talk his way out of problems or solve quests. Sure, you can try to spread into many skills but this may mean you will be unprepared for some future situations, so specialization I think is key. I would say this game is similar to Neo Scavanger on this part. In both games you have to think about what you are going to do. Eating uncleaned water or trying to fight a soldier without having some weapon training could be deadly in both games.  Now that the role playing part is described, I think I should write a bit about story. If you read any of the other reviews, you will know this game is full of C&amp;C (Choice &amp; Consequence). Many of the actions you will take will influence the events that you will received in the future and how you will be treated. Kill a guild trader and you may find that an assassin will be sent after you. Believe the words of a shady looking person and you will find yourself dead in a ditch. The C&amp;C part is probably the reason this game took so long to make, since every background should be viable and also different from the others. What this means is that huge ammounts of text are in this game and it's a lot of (great) reading to be made. I don't think there is any game with so much C&amp;C. The only game that has a smaller amount of C&amp;C is maybe the Witcher series, but not even them don't have as many outcomes and ways to deal with situations. Now that I think a bit, maybe Fallout 2 is a bit similar to it. Both are post apocalyptic games, with turn based combat and many skills that unlock different ways to solve the problems. Similar to Fallout New Vegas there is also a reputation system which opens or closes the way you gain access to some quests.  Like I said in the beginning, the combat is turn based, with different type of attacks available for each weapon. Each weapon class also has different uses and special attacks (eg. you can impale with the spear). If you played Fallout 1 or Fallout 2 is should be very similar. You use action points to move, to make attacks, use items (like poison), etc. Related to fight is also a crafting &amp; alchemy mechanic which can be used to turn the balance on your favor in the harder fights. I think that the fights are well made, with enemies trying different tactics to kill you. What is important also to fighting is avoiding damage, which can be made in two ways: dodge or armor (you can't max both since armor decreases dodge chance).   This is a great game and I recommend it to any serious RPG fan. If you only played this kind of games recently, and didn't try older RPGs, this kind of game may seem harder to play but it really is not. It's a game that doesn't treat you like some brain-dead jellyfish. From my part, this should be the game of the year.  TL; DR Game is great, lots of C&amp;C with classes that play different and turn based combat. GOTY material, now go and buy a copy!",

The graphics, art design and stilted animations make it look like a kind of B grade title from the early 2000's. The look and feel of AoD wouldn't compare favorably to a game like Gladius from 2003 for instance (though admittedly comparing it with work from a big studio like Lucasarts title isn't very fair). But, this was a fine game.  It had wider sub-plot branches than I've come to expect from an RPG and tightly balanced combat. There's nothing terribly original about the story but it feels carefully crafted. There is a lot of writing but hardly any bloat, so it seems like it has had plenty of careful editing.   It's fairly easy to recommend. Beware of elevators, though... You'll spend half the game hearing about Doomed Archaelogical Expeditions that discovered elevators... then never returned! *gasp*",

If you enjoy Fallout 1 and 2 this is definitely worth a shot. Very excited to see the party based DLC. Replayabiltiy is MASSIVE in this game! I also suggest a few things:  1) Play the demo first - if you like the game you can continue from your demo saves. Also make multiple characters/builds in the demo.  2) Get in the habit of making MANY quick saves + manual saves.  3) Don't spend skill points right as you get them, spend only what you need for the type of character you are making to pass skillchecks/combat as they appear during the game.   4) Start the game making a pure fighter then play a game as a pure talker before trying to make a hybrid. Once you get a sense of the skill checks a Praetor hybrid playthrough was VERY satisfying.  5) For combat oriented characters I suggest 1H hammer + block or 1H spear + block (specifically Kadmos' Skewer) with high percpetion for aimed attacks. Swords seemed rather weak for some reason. I would suggest staying away from dodge and to only put points in block as dodge seems fairly gimped relative to block.",

The only thing I wish more of would be magic in it, it would then be more accurate to call it a mixture between Fallout 1 or 2 and Baldurs Gate. But the magic is lacking and in fantasy games I tend to want it, even if it is based on our own world where there are no demons, gods and the like to mess things up for us. (not that humans need help in destroying our world thats for sure) over all I would say 4 stars. Good and hard but not full jackpot.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing this game a lot after buying it, not because its so much fun, but because I kept trying different characters to see if I could progress to the end. This game is supposed to be difficult in comparison to other top down rpg games. What I find that makes it difficult is the game is designed too restrictively. My longest progression was as an asssasin, but I reached a point where I am unable to finish any more quests because I did not spend my character points gained from exp as I'm 'supposed' to. At least as far as I can guess. I've tried other characters with diffrerent roles and I become too annoyed that i'm not spending points as per, i'm assuming, the developers expect you to. There is almost no leeway to create a variation on a character. My assassin, to continue to progress, should not have any points spent in anything except fighting stats, sneaking, alchemy, and crafting. To finish the game as an assassin you can't do it as a charismatic killer or someone who is able to do stealth kills. Want to be a lore master who can also fight at least decently? Not happening. In the end I'm finding not spending points specifically right my characters were too limited for me to enjoy completing quests.  As for the dialogue its poor, generic. The cursing seems thrown in instead of natural.  The combat system is done well enough, but unless I focused purely on combat stats the fights required me to reload over and over and trying new things over and over. My characters began to feel like they could not handle themselves in a regular fight. Fighting is dangerous, you can easily be killed in reality, sure. But if its causing me in game to get annoyed or frustrated instead of keen to see what I'm able to do the game ends up not being worth my time.  Wait for this to be on sale.",

It is not a game that tells you your choices matter - only to later show you that the only thing that matters about them is one mission that's marginally different.  In Age of Decadence your choices will define you AND the empire at large. You can bring down whole families or guilds, you can isntall an emperor. You can betray your closest friends and allies, or side with your enemies in a spur-of-the moment decision. These betrayals will have an impact on everyones life, and your own - normally the termination of your own unless you're aptly prepared.   And all of this while being a very mortal character. Did I mention you're very mortal? No longer can you wade through a horde and come away unscathed, instead you end up dying in a back alley to a pair of muggers. This is a game where you're not only told you matter, but you can see just how you matter in the changing landscape of the world.  All this being said it's probably not a game for everyone, but if you love a story that actually ties you into it (did I mention that the main storylines of every class intertwine at different points throughout the game?) then this game may be for you.",

To have any success in combat you need to play a character who is an idiot, and hybrid play seems to pay off extremely poorly. So you are a weakling smooth talker, an assasin, or a big brute. When I treid to play with even somewhat hybrid roles (say 6-6-6-6-9-7) the playthroughs just really don't go well without a lot of save loading.  In many ways I kind fo felt this was more of a puzzle game than an RPG. It is hard to do well without knowing which quests are coming and when to take what upgrades.

It's a wonderful RPG though, and a great roleplaying experience is bound for any who play.   10/10  Pros: *Great Combat System (may take some time getting used too) *Great Soundtrack *Great World, Lore, Story, and Characters  Cons: Nothing of note, though this RPG is absolutely not for everyone. ------------------------------------  The world itself is rather gritty and has a nice realistic display of combat, so it doesn't paint you as this amazing hero who can destroy ten people at once. The combat system is turn-based and hard hitting, turning into a blast once you get a hang of the system. Though, combat can be brutal... luckily, thanks to the wonderful development of the game, every instance of combat can be avoided. Which is very refreshing in the RPG world.   It's clear the people who made the game care about it and put a lot of effort in it, with the world being highly believable and character's dialogue on point. The world and lore is wonderfully portrayed and something that was new for me. The story, characters, and places are surprisingly memorable, and though the graphics are dated, I enjoy them immensely. They're nostalgic of older RPGs and the style itself is pretty. The way the game does dialogues is well done, with the abilities and skills coming in handy and the little box that pops up when talking having a certain amount of charm. As for sound, the soundtrack is great, with beautiful tracks to go with towns and exploring, and epic ones for the right moments. If you like RPG's, I definitely give this one a recommendation.",

            "review_text": "This game is outstanding, and deserves to go down as an RPG classic. It has its rough edges - the graphics look at least a decade out of date, and it is not intended to offer a balanced experience: but it also offers the most distinctive RPG experience currently available.  The setting eschews the typical pseudo-medieval fantasy for something akin to post-Roman Europe: the last vestiges of civilisation hanging on after the collapse of their infrastructure, power-struggles and political machinations rife among the surviving city-states, propsectors scavenge old ruins for the remains of better time and everyone else does exactly what it takes to stay alive. The nearest analogy I can think of would be Dark Sun.  Character creation is also distinctive - you can be a warrior, a thief or an assassin: or a politician, a mercenary, a historian, a con artist or a drifter. You have both combat skills (dodging, blocking and the various weapons) and civil skills (sneaking, stealing, lockpicking, persuasion, crafting, alchemy, Lore, impersonation...). The skills are many, no character can maximise all (or even many) of them, and they have a huge impact on your experience of the world.  Combat is brutal and unforgiving - but also deep and highly tactical. A good Alchemist can craft bombs and poisons that will make a huge difference to the way a fight goes. You need to select between rapid and weak shots, through to slower but more powerful shots according to an enemy's armour and mobility. You can't win every fight.  The key thing to recognise with this game is that you're not playing a world-changing hero: you're crafting the story of a particular individual, and it won't necessarily end well. There are points where you make momentous decisions that change the course of the world - but there are also points where you are buffeted by forces you can't control because you don't have the skills you need, and it's important to recognise that in order to see everything the game has to offer you will have to play through with several, very different characters. You're guaranteed to reach some dead ends, and points where if you send your character up for the choice you want, they'll just get killed - and it all depends upon your build.  My first character was an Assassin, set to sneak, steal and blag his way through the game - armed with a bow, and dependent on incendiaries for crowd management and poison for maximum effect. I struggled at the end of the first city, unable to complete the 'boss fights' on offer, and it took me a while of frustrating repeat playthroughs thinking 'This is so unfair! How am I meant to do this?' before realising I wasn't. I didn't have to beat the fight to progress - only if I wanted a particular outcome. Other characters might have been able to do this, but they wouldn't have had the same options as me, and in the end I just legged it to the next city. I didn't get the outcome I wanted, but that's very much how this game works: you make the most of the situations presented to you. My assassin got close to end game, before finally running out of steam - skills too thinly spread to make progress (not combat enough to fight through, not persuasuive enough to talk through). So that was that.  My second character was a Loremaster (historian), who specialise almost entirely in history, crafting and persuasion, and completed the game's storyline without a single fight. What was striking was how different the experience was: seeing the same characters in different lights, finding that locations my Assassin had made it into with ease were now impassible because I couldn't fight, and strolling into areas that had been locked to my assassin. I still couldn't get the end game that I wanted, but I still had a whole range of choices about what happened, that really shaped the world around me.  And that's the heart of The Age of Decadance: choice and consequence, and making the best of a bad situation. Most of your characters will come a cropper, and you'll be choosing between the best of a bad lot, blown hither and yon by forces you can't control, but still shaping your destiny with every choice. It's brutal, it's rewarding, and it's completely unique. If you want to power game, minimaxing your character and getting everything right, this isn't the game for you. If you want to weigh up every choice of weapon, skill and dialogue because they carry very real consequences, then I can't think of anywhere else that offers this much quality.",

There are so many funny moments in this game, strange outcomes and interesting fights.  You dont have to fight, my first character couldnt fight at all, still made it through. But if you want to fight there are alot of very interesting plot devices for that too.  I've played dragon age inquisition, and i wasnt very fond of it. i loved dragon age origins, baldurs gate series, neverwinter nights series and recently games like pillars of eternity.   This is a fantastic game, i've had so much fun with it, and it has so much replayability that many other RPGs lack.  Very much recommended.  Only cons i can think of is that its a bit hardcore, you want to save often (press F5)...and there is no shame in loading (F9). But tbh, thats part of the fun...because it does matter what you decide to do, your decision might very well get you killed :)",

            "review_text": "Just completed my second playthrough post-release. I think I'm ready to review this masterpiece of a game semi-properly.   The Age of Decadence is a cRPG that does a lot amazingly. It's one of the few RPGs where the setting and story actually feel related to the difficulty. It's set on a harsh world, with Roman influences, that the gods have abandoned, and mankind is left to die slowly.  'In a land where the ancient evil has never awakened, the job of destroying the world was left to mankind.' From the game's trailer. But as you explore the ancient locations in AoD, you will be surprised, and wonder at what the old world was. You heard tales of gods, Magi, and beings invading the world and causing the apocalypse, but the reality will be quite different. I don't want to spoil more.   The game promises that combat will be tough, and it is. Until you get good equipment and are skilled at weapons, you will have difficulty in fighting one person, let alone two or three. And when you get to the point of being able to take on three well-armed people, the game still has a few surprises left... There's 7 different types of weaponry and 2 different defense skills, each with their advantage, and alchemy will get you poisons, bombs and potions (not magical potions!), and you still ahve some non-alchemical gear that might help - nets especially. Combat is great, though the only thing I feel lacking is the inability to choose (when it makes sense that you would be able to do it) the exact position you start in the several combat setpieces (no random encounters), since you only get a vague choice once (at least from my fairly limited experiece.) Combat is overall pretty good.  Of course, you can complete the game without ever getting into combat! This is what I would call the 'easy mode' of AoD, the Merchants' Guild quest. ~12 hours of tactical skill allocation (so you can get through the skill checks the best way) and a choose-your-own-adventure game with top-notch writing. Wait, 12 hours?! That's short as hell!  Well... The thing is, AoD respects your time. It doesn't bloat the game time with endless trash mobs (Hi Dragon Age series!) but gives you 8-14 hours of quests with a ridiculous amount of choice and consequence. And there's the hybrid path; hybrid between a social character and a full combat one. This is harder and requires a bit of knowledge about the game, and I haven't tried it yet, I plan to do it whenever I boot up the game again. This is the best way to get some of the hardest content to get in the game. And let's talk about content.  AoD has a lot of content, but you will only access a single fraction of it in one playthrough. The game fully supports being played countless times, as starting with a different faction and origin will give you a different view, a completely different set of quests, and access to places you've seen before. And in each playthrough, you will find something that you can't do because, well, your build isn't right. That's alright! Get a new origin and try a different character build after you finish the current one, and get it, since you should know ho to get it now. This is a game where achievements are actually quite useful, since they measure how much of the content you've actually experienced. There's quite a lot of people with 100+ hours that still haven't gotten some achievements, and that shousl give you an idea of how much content this game has.  All in all, The Age of Decadence is an extremely ambitious game, and a breath of fresh air from the rehashed AAA console RPGs and the rehashed games trying to copy the great classics both. It's on its own level and it's become one of my favourite games of all time. Thank you Iron Tower Studios, for such a gem, especially to Vince, for both the idea of this game, and the great reviews and forum posts on RPG design :)",

            "review_text": "This is the real deal. If you've ever wondered what cRPGs could be from a design standpoint, how they could evolve beyond their limitations, this is it. This game is unique, it offers far more than anything that has been done before.   What am I talking about, exactly? 'Choice and consequences' - the buzzwords that have been thrown around regarding cRPGs for the last decade or so. Most veteran players realise that this concept is an empty one. David Gaider of Bioware often says that from a design standpoint, you can only give the players the illusion of choice - a choice that has no real impact, that doesn't branch out the player in an entirely new direction. The logic behind this is that most players do not play a game more than once and that it would be far too much resource-intensive to invest in all the branching that would make player choice relevant.  Age of Decadence is going boldly against this pragmatic, safe, frankly boring attitude. It will give you more choice that any other cRPG has ever done. You will miss content in one playthrough. Sometimes you'll make bad choices. Who your character is will matter in how the story evolves. It takes the word 'role playing' seriously : how you build your character will dramatically influence your experience.   It isn't for nothing : the game has been in development for 9 years. A lot of it was part-time, true, but the amount of content here is staggering. This is truly what cRPGs can be. If you've ever felt like this genre was stagnating, if you're wondered how they could realise freedom in a game such as this, then give it a shot.  Of course, a word of warning : the game is strictly for an hardcore crowd and doesn't shy away from it. It is not meant to please everyone. The setting itself is far from friendly and the narrative has a sadistic pleasure in not catering to your ego. For some it will be a dose of fresh air, for others, well, there are already plenty of games for the others.  Same thing with the combat - it is a frustrating affair, but oh-so-satisfying when you master the system and beat the sh*t out of everyone you don't like.   The graphics, to me, are quite decent, but some people will find reason to complain. I say f*ck em, but yeah.   Buy this game! We want to see more games out of Iron Tower Studio!",

Choices matter, both what skills and attributes you choose, but also what you decide to do in the game world.

Low points would be the fact that the end game feels a bit more limited compared to the start in terms of what you can do. The art to me was nicely directed and felt coherent and suitable for the setting, still, I can imagine someone finding the art and graphics a bit lacking. Doesn't really matter to me.

            "review_text": "Considering how differently the game plays based on what type of character you choose, I should preface this review by saying that I played as a loremaster on my playthrough (though I plan on replaying the game and trying other roles).  Age of Decadence offers most one of the most unique and interesting settings I've encountered in an RPG. It's a post-apocalyptic world in a Roman &amp; Arabian inspired setting. However, as you explore more of the world and discover some of its long lost secrets, you'll also find elements of fantasy and sci-fi as well. It makes for a strange &amp; interesting mixture but the game manages to pull it off without making the world feel random and incoherent.  In terms of gameplay, if you play the game as non-combat based character, it plays less like a typical CRPG and a lot more like an adventure game with stat-based dialog checks and a heavy emphasis on choices &amp; consequences and non-linear progression.  One of the great things about the game is that there's practically no filler content. There are no tedious slogs through boring dungeons or endless waves of repetitive combat encounters. The game also has a fast travel system that lets you instantly teleport between locations, something I'm not a huge fan of in most RPGs but here it actually works in the game's favor. This results in the game being on the shorter side for this type of game (it will take you about 15 hours on your first playthrough but I can easily see someone finishing the game in around 5 hours on repeat playthroughs). However, considering the game just begs to be replayed multiple times, this is something you'll appreciate.  The biggest issue with AoD is that it doesn't make the greatest first impression. The starting area is visually the least interesting area in the game and a lot of the stuff you do in the starting area is relatively mundane compared to what's in store later in the game. Also, the 3D graphics and top-down viewpoint don't work well together, resulting in you constantly having to rotate the camera. But if you can get past these things, you'll find an incredibly compelling world to explore where you'll go to any length to learn more about its secrets (like sacrificing a whole bunch of slaves!)   Highly recommended for fans of turn-based CRPGs with a heavy emphasis on replayibility &amp; choices and consequences. Actually, due to the variety of playstyles available, even if you're not a fan of turn-based combat, I'd still recommend trying to play it more like an adventure game with a non-combat character just to experience the setting and story (I completed the game without once getting into combat).",

I am very fond of true roguelikes, and restarting a game multiple times doesn't bother me, as long as I can expect a different experience each time.   AoD does not deliver this. What we have here is a very linear progression, but with artificial limitations force by the extremely stringent stat and skill points. There may be multiple ways of accomplishing an objective, however the end result is essentially the same.   This model essentially forces you to choose to be either a talker, or a fighter - hybrid builds are invariably fatally underpowered. Generally speaking, since you have less skills to spread your points as a fighter, it is easier to build a strong pure fighting character than it is a pure talker - there are several different types of persuasion mechanics as a talker, which are sometimes tested at the same time. You might be great at disguise, but if the check called for disguise AND trading, you're screwed.   There are crafting abilities as well, however your points are spread thin enough as it is, and sinking points into crafting can set back your progress significantly.   Note that the above are all gameplay complaints, but I'd like to talk for a moment about the graphics and interface. Now, I'm not normally a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥, but this game looks...not good. At best, the graphics are 10 years behind current gen. I think they would have been better off with an isometric view (like Baldur's Gate) than trying for full 3D. Additionally, the controls are very wonky, and the screens extremely bare.   The setting itself is intriguing, and is the basis for what hours I did give this game. There are interesting aspects to the story, but some of it is never fully fleshed out, and what is there is vastly overshadowed by the poor overall design.",

            "review_text": " pu]An interesting, and rewarding approach to RPGs [/u].    Some of the things that make this game enjoyable for me are:   - A Combat system that is very logical at its core : One with a feeling of realism and obviousness, but that still allows your imagination, creativity, and preparation to dictate the course of the encounters. You can visually assess your chances of success before committing to a fight, but there are unseen elements that could turn the tide either way. The core system is simple and removes the randomness and fantasy elements (your gear is a big part of the fight), but the skills and player-chosen styles can easily off-set close odds. It's actually disappointing that more games don't use a similar system.  - A Skill system that is based in reality : Your skills make sense and play into the interactions you have nearly every step of the way. Your skills (and lack of skills) dictate the flow of conversations, turn of events, and the opportunities to explore different paths throughout the story. You  will  play a different game with every different combination of skills you choose, whether it's a combat experience or a non-combat one.  - A world that you're actively impacting : How you succeed and fail (depending on your perspective) shapes the course of the story and the interactions you have throughout the game. People do not forget, and life doesn't just go on. Not only is the player's experience altered by their choices, but it's felt by all characters and by the turn of events that you witness.  - A game you'll have to replay : Beacuse the play styles are so different, and result in such a different story experience, you'll be surprised at how much you missed in a single play through. The dialogue is rich, and the story thorough, well planned, and well-guarded. You won't learn things for no reason at all. You'll hear the common woes of the people you meet, but you'll actively need to pursue the pieces of the puzzle if you want to put it together. Because different choices result in different experiences, you may meet the same people across different play-throughs but feel like you're talking to a very different person. The game is fantastic about making the characters dynamic, and you'll realize that you're really only ever getting to know someone from the perspective of their disposition toward you and the way you've impacted them.   One Con to speak of:   While the game is great there is one big draw for me. I wish the game was longer, or bigger in scope. I wish there were more cities, more regions, more items, more characters, more everything. I realize there is always budgets, but this is a game we would all benefit from it being bigger. I want to be playing my favorite characters right now, but I've already done everything and beaten the game, so that's that. :( Some play styles are quick. You'll hit an ending without realizing what you're getting into. It will make sense in the grander scheme, but can feel like you just dumped all your hopes for that character and that play through down the drain.    Overall, I would definitely recommend this game. Both for the price point, and to support this development team's next endeavor ",

If you make a character who can socialize, you absolutely cannot fight.  It's an extremely limited experience in the guise of something deeper and more dynamic.

            "review_text": "Mind numbingly slow. In every way. Nearly every decision you have to make regarding how to complete a quest and how to develop your character is a trial and error ordeal of figuring out new ways to die. Most combat situations are explicitly there to serve as dead ends, literally. So if you thought of being some super bad assassin, pouring all of your points into crossbow, dagger, and dodge, you will still find yourself in an unwinnable fight before even leaving the first town. While an interesting and glorious death it may be, ultimately it is simply a lesson in what not to do. So you have to start a new game all over again, and try again with different stats and hope for the best. This makes the entire gameplay experience rather tedious overall. A fact that is compounded by the unforgiveably slow movement speed of your character. I liken the hours I've put in so far to the punishment of Sisyphus, with the boulder rolling back down the hill for a different reason each time. Good premise, good dialog, promising combat engine, solid world building, but so agonizingly slow that it saps all the fun out.  Some suggestions to turn this game into something wonderful:  - INCREASE MOVEMENT SPEED!  - more side quests to earn points for character development  - stat boosting equipment to give your character that extra flexibility in addressing situations, like a bloodstained tunic that boosts streetwise when worn, a make-up kit that improves impersonation if it is in your inventory, soft shoes that improve sneak, craftable picks that improve lockpick, perfume that improves etiquette, etc...",

But having played the first chapter through several times with different characters, I've found that while each had different details, each also felt too much the same, and I ended up with really no emotional incentive to continue into the next chapter with any of them.  I think the thing that bugs me most is that there's just not enough built-in story to carry the weak mechanics, and not enough player leeway to give the feeling of an emergent story; in the end, I'm doing boring things in order to expose the ho-hum single conversation that will advance the unengaging story.  It's as linear as a JRPG, without the depth of writing *or* the interesting combat mechanics that make those satisfying. It's as story-light as a tactical RPG, without the multiple tactical options that make those interesting.  Honestly, I think the developers would have been much better off using RPGmaker or another such tool that would provide all the basic mechanics and engine for them, so they could really work on their story and flavor. But instead all their energy has been soaked up getting mediocre mechanics and production values onto the screen, with nothing left to make it shine.",

            "review_text": "This old-school style RPG succeeds brilliantly at creating a series of vignettes for the player to interact with. The system is heavily based on your skills and attributes, and the wide plentifulness of content is gated by skills which makes the player constantly guess what they're missing.   The problem is that everything else--and I do mean  everything else --is mediocre to bad. The setting is unimaginative and the characters are intentionally made flat and unlikable, which means that for all it's success in creating a game with mystifying and challenging goals, both the background, pulp, and the payoff of these goals feel completely hollow. Dialogue is extremely uninteresting and nearly all of it has the same literary voice. There's a conversation with a certain character that has very strict requirements to initiate, but once you do initiate it, they basically end up spelling out every single secret the world has to offer. Once you get to this conversation, you have no reason to ever pay attention to any of the dialogue except for your own options. This is drilled into your head by the fact that there is a skill check in nearly every dialogue menu and there are only 2-3 instances where you can do anything meaningful without a skill check.  The combat system is acceptably mediocre, but the way that encounters and combat skills are managed is truly awful. The developers favored realism over feasibility, except in cases where realism would ever favor the player. For example, during the first act, you are tasked with taking on a bandit camp. True to what would be the case in a realistic scenario, these bandits travel in packs (5 people), and have poor equipment, but are roughly as good in combat as an inexperienced imperial guard. The problem is that the player *physically cannot* reach a point where they are better than an imperial guard. Consequentially, this means that the player is facing five opponents equally as strong as they are.   The intricacy of the vignettes wears off quickly when you realize what you have to do to meaningfully interact with them. Because the world is so boring and the game is so skill check heavy, all you're doing is unlocking meaningless content. The whole game is a glorified excel spreadsheet.",

            "review_text": "I want to like this game because it's obvious that a lot of work went into it without having access to much in the way of budget. The writing is entertaining, there's ample and well thought out lore that feels immediately relevant, and there's a plethora of dialogue trees and questlines promoting replay. Also, the setting is really intriguing and unique, and making combat inherently risky and more 'real' while offering non-combat choices is a refreshing approach.   That said, the graphics are dated. While the sprites are very well done (the portrait art is some of the best I've seen, full stop) the character models are primitive. I'm not sure how much of that is a limitation of the engine, but I've seen other games using the same engine address that limitation through creative artistic design choices.   Though the writing itself is strong, the storytelling left me a bit cold. If an RPG isn't going to motivate the player by pushing them to level stats or find bigger and better loot, then it has to pull them along by engaging their sympathies with the main character. That never happened for me. It still felt like I was just walking around clicking on things and talking to people because that's how the game moves forward, not because I was motivated to progress along a quest line or for any particular roleplaying purposes.   Finally, and this is the thing that made me give up on the game, there are too many false choices in a game that prides itself on the strength of its dialogue. Many if not most of the conversations felt more like traps than actual role playing, reminiscient of the old 'Choose Your Own Adventure' books. They boiled down to, 'You see a knife. Do you a.) try to eat it, or b.) stab yourself.' Without giving specific examples (to avoid spoilers) one that stands out results in either betraying the person you offered to help or having to fight an angry mob. As a persuasive, streetwise, charismatic trader I oddly never had the option to negotiate, an option I felt wasn't unreasonable to expect and which was my intention when I began the dialogue. I finally ended up simply avoiding the encounter, a choice I found myself having to make too many times through the game. The alternative, which I also exercised fairly often, was reloading until I found the right sequence of responses to progress.   As I say, I want to enjoy the game, but, frankly, there are too many other RPGs that have addressed the shortcomings here without being excessively 'casual'.   ",
