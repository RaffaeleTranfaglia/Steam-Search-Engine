The cutscenes and bonus areas really make you feel like you're gliding through the sky; making the game somewhat relaxing.  The depth percepton can be off which can get kind of annoying. There's a 3D mode but I don't have any Red/Cyan glasses to put it to use. In that sense, with the move camera and this depth issue, the game might be perfect for the Nintendo 3DS!  The story and characters are trash for the most part; the usual Japanese stuff. You can pretty much ignore it so it's not really a problem.",

Great graphics, challenging game play and it has narrative! (often missing in bullet hells).   My only gripe is that on first launch YOU MUST KNOW the control scheme. As a veteran gamer I quickly worked out that it employs the often used Z, X and C keys. I can however imagine the frustration of someone who didn't know to try those keys as they went through every key on the keyboard just to figure out how to navigate the initial menu",

            "review_text": "While I did like the game we'll come to the positives and negatives later, given a bunch of the negative ratings which obviously result from cluelessness I feel I should write a few things to consider for everyone who thinks about getting and playing this game.  1. Weapons and Upgrades: First and foremost, there are no upgrades here and you only have one ship. That being said, the ship has 3 modes (Normal, Overdrive and Extra) and every mode has it's own set of 3 more or in some cases less similar weapons. This is NOT the type of game where you just take the best weapon you can find and hold down the button. Let's explain the main weapons of the normal mode, once you get the hang of them you can figure out the other modes yourself. -Primary Fire - keep pressing the primary button: Deals fast and high damage in a straight arc, good for bosses and bigger enemies -Primary Fire Alternative - Hold Button to load, release button when charged to fire: This fires an piercing shot that deals 500 damage to everything in it's path, it's sometimes useful against bosses but you will mostly want to use this against many enemies, especially when the important enemies are obstructed by armor or other enemies -Secondary Fire - keep pressing the secondary button: This mode is simlar to the primary fire mode but it puts your weapons at an angle to cover the screen, it is also weaker than the primary mode, obviously used to dispatch small fry -Secondary Fire Alternative - Hold Button to load, release button when charged to fire: This creates a field that negates bullets immediately and cuts off any beams, it also deals moderate damage to enemies, you will in some cases need this to avoid being hit and there are a few places where this shield can also be used offensively -Tertiary Fire - Hold Button to unleash a constant stream of homing missiles: This fires a constant stream of missiles after locking on to an enemy, deals a little less damage than the primary mode -Tertiary Fire Alternative - While the weapon is active and an enemy is locked on to, press nothing to load and press tertiary fire to unleash: This fires a barrage of missiles which create an AoE damage effect, this is useful and almost necessary in some places to dispatch certain groups of enemies fast  As I said, it's not about using the strongest weapon, it's about using the right weapon at the right time. As a rule of thumb, it's possible to destroy everything that ever enters the screen, if you're not even getting close it means you're not using your arsenal right. There are only very few expections to this, one for example being the scene in the city where you can either destroy the laser cannons or the ship in the background, but there you won't be able to destroy everything.  2. Enemies and avoiding death: This is not a bullet hell shooter like Touhou but for those that are not hardcore in shmups things can get pretty unpleasant. I for one will probably never finish scene 7 without taking a hit, but I won't try either. So, many people complained about the bullets being almost invisible in some places, so I think I should point out right away that there is an option to play with hideous but absolutely unmissable red hit boxes. If you ever feel the bullets just pass right through your vision into your ship, turn this option on and play the game with it. You can turn it off afterwards, and then you'll know what to pay attention to. Pro-tip: After playing through the game with those hit boxes I have now no problem wahtsoever with 'not seeing' any bullet, when I get hit it's just me not being fast enough or picking the wrong path, even without the hideous hit boxes.  Also, you start with a small amount of shields and continues. As you play the game though you'll earn extra initial shields and continues. If you can't beat the game, play it until you have the shields and continues you need. This is a shmup after all and it's not supposed to be so terrifyingly easy that just about anyone can beat it on their first try.  3. Story: Just a tiny hint here, if the story bothers you, turn it off. Yes, you don't have to skip it you can just completely remove it by switching the Cutscene Type from Original mode to Remaster. It'll prompt you every time before you start a game.  Now to what is good, what is bad and should you buy this game:  Positive: -Nice cinematics give the game a lively feeling -You start with a set of different weapons which need to be used strategically -3 different fighter modes  Neutral: -The game switches directions a lot, I for one like it but if you can't handle it you'll probably hate it -No upgrades, instead you start with a bunch of different weapons -Story, some hate it and some others love it, I for one found it to be a tiny bit interesting but in the end it's just not anything special that captures my attention  Negative: -The graphics and the level designs are mediocre at best. -No Full HD resolution -The game is pretty short -There's a level where you have to read part of the story while fighting, either bring a lot of shields and continues and read it once or ignore it  And should you buy it? If you liked what you read above then I'd say yes, you should consider getting it during a sale though unless you're a real fan of shmups like these.",

            "review_text": "This game combines vertical, horizontal and perspective shooter. However, it is neither of them. At the end it can't achieve the precision of 2d shooters, nor the inmersion of the 3d ones.  When the game gives the idea of highlighting hitboxes you know there is something wrong.  The main problem is the bullets. its color. the enemy bullets mix with the backgroundand the effects. you have to force your sight to see them. This is especially anoying on the 5th and final stage when the bosses start shooting voleys of small purple-grayish bullets which are the same color as the background.  Then comes the perspective. On the same stage, the game changes the perspective like 10 times, leaving you confused and dizzy and at the verge of a seizure. And it gets even worse when you combine this with the bullets problem. You don't know what's on the same plane as you and can kill you and what is over or under you.  Come on, I am trying to play! If I'd want to see spaceships shooting at each other in some weird angles I'd watch some mecha anime.",
