            "review_text": "TL;DR: This game was fun but all the free assets don't make it worth the current price.  This game was pretty fun and I enjoyed it a lot. I only played one route so far, I got Kale's good route, but I do plan on going back and trying the other routes. Not sure if this was worth the current cost though ($8.09 on a sale, but full price is $8.99). The reason I feel this is because this was made using Ren'Py.  Now, for those of you unfamiliar with the engine or game dev in general, Ren'Py is a really nice Python engine for making visual novel games. Most visual novels you've probably tried or will try are written in this. The reason for this being it has all the features of regular visual novels already built in. It's free, you can download it yourself and play around with it, but the main thing with it is it makes visual novel making so much easier that all the programming is pretty much done. All you really need to focus on is the writing, art, and sound, because Ren'Py is set so that you just have to assign the assets to variables and then use them in a kind of movie script.  There's nothing wrong at all with using this engine, it's really ncie and convinient, but the problem is the assets using for the game. Most of them are free assets found online. So really when you pay for the game you're really paying for the script writing.  Again, this isn't me saying this game is bad at all, and I can more than understand why a game dev would feel their game deserves to be priced the way it is. I don't know how much money was actually spent behind the scenes on this game, so maybe I'm wrong about some things. But to me, it definitely feels the price is a bit too high.  Some have compared this game to Hatoful Boyfriend, and I can definitely agree on the resemblance since it's a funny concept visual novel and the birds in that seem like free or cheap assets as well, but that game has lots of assets that were made by the devs as well. In fact the birds even have human personas drawn by the devs. Meanwhile, this game doesn't seem to have any assets that are the actual dev's own creation. In the credits of this game, almost all images are attributed to Flickr.  But again, I have no problem paying for writing and a fun experience. I don't regret this purchase at all, in fact I'm going to be playing it more for all the routes. I just don't think the current price is fair is all. Despite this, I don't feel this game was a rip off like others think. I think any dev has the right to charge whatever they want for their game and that if any buyer doesn't like what they got, just refund it. It's the dev's job to make the player not want to refund it, but also too many people buy visual novels these days and are disappointed when they find out it's not exactly a 'game' game. That's not the dev's fault.  ALSO one last thing, why isn't there an options menu? I want to adjust music volumes but there doesn't seem to be a way to do so. I know Ren'Py has a built in settings option, so why disable it?  In conclusion, this game was fun and I hope you give it a chance, but if you don't agree with the price I understand. VOTE FOR KALE!",

            "review_text": "What the actual ♥♥♥♥ did I just buy? It is such an insult even considering this piece of garbage to be mentioned as a game. Mostly the entire time you will be skipping unnecessary dialogues in which you have nearly zero effect when it comes to interference between you and the 'game'. Oh yeah and you can also pick your very own name, Woah! And ladies and gentlemen that is about it. I didn't even bother reading the dialogues further after 15 minutes of my play through. So after suffering from internal boredom I decided to keep on skipping the dialogues and was hoping there would be some distinction in the game mechanics but nope, you just need to repetetivly press the Enter key and eventualy you'll be done with the 'game' and if you wont finish it through your first play through you can still manualy save the game, woah! I mean why even bother putting saving slots in the 'game' when you know nobody is going to like it? This 'game' is obviously trying to trick cat lovers into buying this game. I wonder who else would want to buy this ♥♥♥♥? Just please don't, it's a waste of money. Also a 10$ price tag, seriously? It's rediculous that this game hase been even allowed to be released for sale.  0/5 !!! DO NOT BUY, NOR DOWNLOAD FOR FREE !!!  Why did I even bother writing this review? I should go and kill my self.",
