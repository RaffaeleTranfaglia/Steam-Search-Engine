            "review_text": "Pros:  The plot is suprisingly good for a game like this, but it can get a little cheesy at times.  The game dosen't look to bad for it's time.  You get many classes to choose from.  You can infuse other classes together (like for instance, you can have a warrior healer class).  The game is long.  The online mode is pretty decent, both pvp and co-op (I didn't spend to long on it so don't take my word for it).  You get two dlc's (which I haven't played yet).  All charcters are voice acted.  You control large epic battles that'll make you hungry for more.  Cons:  You can't use your singleplayer charcter online, you need to make seperate charcters, which isn't to bad, but I thought it should be mentioned  Even though you have a wide choice of player classes, you'll feel as if they are kinda usless during big battles.  The units can be a pain in the a** to control sometimes.  The heros don't level up so they constantly need to be replaced.  There isn't to much help as to where to go, sure if you keep going without backtracking you'll be fine, but if you go back for sidequests or whatever you'll most likely get lost for a good hour.  You are slow as f***, and that dosen't help since 50% of the game consists of running around from place to place.  The game can get real repetitive sometimes, and you will most likely quit becuase of it.   Despite the cons, this is a great game, and I highly recomend it, even at full price.",

            "review_text": "Spellforce - Platinum Edition is a must have for all those who enjoy RTS/RPG type mechanics. Spellforce boasts a truly lengthy campaign, gorgeous visuals, unique mechanics, diversity in lore - factions, landscapes, etc... fantastic ambience, and an excellent soundtrack! Spellforce delivers a staggering selection of weaponry, armour, spells, and other miscellanous items - with a fair amount of customization, post-character creation. Spellforce IS a well scripted game, but unfortunately suffers in the voiced audio department (as each and every character in the game seems to speak in a perpetually monotone voice with major lack of expressions and tone), and if that doesn't turn you away (as it shouldn't), Spellforce delivers on all fronts as a polished, refined, and exceptionally well-crafted product. Spellforce is a top notch singleplayer experience, and delivers it's entertainment in a great many of ways. I highly recommend this excellent title!",

            "review_text": "This game might very well have defined my childhood and forever formed what I expect of an RPG, along with classics like Divine Divinity and Neverwinter Nights. Back when patches were got from magazines and expansion packs actually meant something, this was up there for me. I still play it when I want a hit of nostalgia or when all I have with me is my laptop that can't run high-performance games. And that's on modern hardware, back in the day it was gorgeous and demanding to the point that my old PC had to rest for half an hour before I could do anything else. Good times. I have a combined 500+ hours in this for sure and only bought it on Steam for easy availability.  Before I go to a TL;DR pros &amp; cons list (see below), here's my opinion:  You're the classic hero, a chosen one to rid the world of an evil scourge. There's not much to it until you think about the twist: a warrior stored in a rune, an immortal and special little snowflake whose tales have survived an apocalypse. You're not a commoner witnessing an event and moving to arms, you're not a soldier rising through the ranks, not an arbitrary divine pick. You're always meant to become the hero of the story because you were a hero in wars before. With this, you've also arrived at the hook that keeps the game rolling. You can't die, you can't exactly lose. When you fall, you resurrect at a bindstone. But that doesn't make the game easy - it takes thought and some strategy and a number of fights are an honest challenge if you're not prepared as a character or have stacked up an army to support. That said, if you like the thrill of perma-death or the prospect of immense consequences to a lost fight, this might not be for you. It's a heroic epic with you in the centre and only very few things can go horribly, game-breakingly wrong. 'twas a different era, after all. Have some fun with it, don't take it too seriously, but enjoy the story. It's got wit, it's got snark and if you play games for their stories, you won't be disappointed.  Back in the day, gameplay was a bit buggy. As the kid I was I didn't understand what that meant, but none of the ones I encountered were game-breaking, perhaps mildy infuriating at worst. The latest versions have got rid of most of the bugs I remember and if there are any left, I haven't found them. With that out of the way, SpellForce managed to balance RTS and RPG quite well for being one of the innovators. You had many ways to accomplish your quests, from sneaking around with your hero party to building up an army to steamroller the whole map. Of course you could easily exploit a near-infinite time window to fortify, gather resources and power-up your army to the max, but it's up to you to limit yourself for more of a challenge or if you'd rather build an epic army to impress your foes and allies alike. Minmaxers will find this game very easy, be aware of that. Character progression was great. Your skills meant something and there wasn't a single specific progression that would eclipse all others, they all had their ways to shine. Just like you'd expect, you could be the tanky warrior going balls-deep into action or you could be a kitey wizard ranger and nuke from a distance. All viable, all great. But you can also branch out too much, wide as the ocean, deep as a puddle and so on. Note: Melee classes have a bit of an upper hand here. They're not terribly OP, but mages do have to rely on support to shine. Once you get rune warriors, the above still stands, though.  Different races have different strengths in the RTS part of it all, but most often the game has picked what you have for you and the rare times you do get to make your own choice between, say, elves and orcs, it doesn't really matter. Mostly you'll find them all equally supportive and they all can overrun your foes if you want them to. Not much to say here, but you'll find yourself having a knack for one or the other at some point. The RTS part was a bit cumbersome, overly shiny and maybe not quite thought-through. Its flaws notwithstanding, it's still a great asset and an integral part of the game and you can relax and have your mind off of things for a while when building a base. (SpellForce 2 got this part just right, it's far better in this aspect, but it's different enough to warrant a separate review.)  Quests. There are a lot of them. You'd expect to find a lot of fetch-and-kill quests, and you'd be right, but they're still... different. You often can't just take the quest, walk a few paces, pick up a thing and come back. More often than not you'll find yourself making a note in your journal to keep an eye out for a thing on your travels, at some point forget about it or get really frustrated because you just can't bloody get it. But then, just as you tossed that quest out your imaginary window, you find that thing. You're overjoyed and soonest you can, make your way back to the quest-giver five-or-more isles back. At their core, these are still simple quests. But they're packaged beautifully in story and nifty mechanics. Many of them are also linked, which is always nice.  The stuff that I have the fondest memories of is above. The story is quite dear to me, but I don't want to spoil anyone, so I won't.  --- TL;DR   Pros     Great story if you give the hero setup the benefit of the doubt    Marvellous graphics if you're into nostalgic games    Okay balance between RPG and RTS gameplay    Balanced character progression    Cool quests    Excellent humour (some references are from a different era, but oh boy the snark)    Great expansions, though the main game is what I mostly refer to here    Cons     Aged graphics - it might make it hard to immerse yourself if you haven't played it before, but it's still gorgeous    Fairly easy - perhaps not a negative, but it's worth saying -, don't expect sweaty palms unless you're reeaally into the story    Some of the travelling is a bit tedious, expect to traverse empty plains, especially if you haven't planned your journeys thoroughly    Very little choice in which race you build your force with in the RTS aspect - it's always a fitting thematic pick, but you don't get to make it  ---  Give SpellForce a try, if you're into the good old days of RPG, you won't regret it. SpellForce 2 is also excellent, but different enough to advise not to expect the same thing. It's also considerably newer, so graphics aren't as out of touch as the first instalment.  Edit: Also a thing to keep in mind, the multiplayer is dead. It was underpopulated when it was still a thing, but obviously nowadays this is to be taken as a sole SP game. I only ever once played MP with a mate - it was a solid experience, but not much else.  Cheers.  ",

The gameplay is great for a game of its time, you can have 2 different type of camera, one which is from top (like Titan Quest) where you control your character(s) and give them orders and the other one which is behind your character where you'll play him. You can have workers and build buildings which you cannot In Dungeon Siege, Titan Quest or even Baldur's Gate, It's original and really great. The game is really great, there is even a free game mode where the replay ability is unlimited. You can also create your maps which can make the game even more awesome.  I'd suggest it to any RPG, Dungeon Siege, Baldur's Gate and Titan Quest (of course, there are a lot more but those are just 3 examples of games similar to this one) fans.  9/10",

            "review_text": "Clunky RTS/RPG combo game that isn't very good at doing either. I really thought this would be pretty good. The first person videos are very deceiving and don't really reflect actual gameplay in which you play from a top down perspective. You can play in first person but certainly not as a mage character. If you played this when it came out you could probably enjoy it since you would be used to the terrible controls, graphics and gameplay, but for the newcomer this should be a game you skip. I will be playing spellforce 2 to see if its any improvement.   I played through with a black mage and....wow you are slightly more useful than your average troop. Cast times are long in relation to the damage output you do and mana is scarce even when you max the pool and regen. Spell upgrades are not meaningful and most of the time i am just regular attacking to do the same amount of damage with less micromanagement. One of the most annoying things is there is no hot keys for spells.....you must click the spell and click the unit you want to attack or heal. In crowds of 30-50 units this can be VERY annoying. I imagine the game is a little better playing a melee unit with an attack that scales properly.  Travel is pretty bad due to large maps and one slow run speed. Takes forever to do the boring fetch quests you are given.   Resource gathering is so simple and isn't rewarding in any way. Its barely even a restriction in making units or buildings, just a slight chore at the start.   The story is as cliche as it gets and the voice acting is very very bland. Doesn't bother me much, but it is worth noting.",

The enemy is quite difficult to beat at times especially when the resources at your disposal are scarce.  You get to level up your heroes and select their abilities as well as the weapons and armour they wear. You build temporary villages to increase your power and fight the awaiting hordes of creatures spawned from the backwaters of hell. Play with elves, humans, dwarves... Although the game in general is linier there are many side quests and areas to explore and you can always go back through the map to catch anything you missed. ",
