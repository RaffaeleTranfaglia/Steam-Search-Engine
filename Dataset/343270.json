It is not scary, the dialogue is laughably awkward, and the voice acting does not match the situation the character is in.....yet I am still recommending it. Why do you ask?! Because it is so bad! Everyone has that favorite movie that is so terrible it is hysterical. This game is nearly 20 minutes of predictable story and moving mannequins everywhere! OK, even though the story was mediocre, I did want to continue to the conclusion, so thats something. The graphics are passable, and there really isn't a soundtrack to comment on. I spent roughly 30 cents on this 'game' and that feels about right to me. My advice is get the game, sell the cards and make a profit.",

            "review_text": "First off I am only recommending this because it was funny and got some good scares in.  Pros: - Good character art. - Nice ambience. - Mannequins that scare the hell out of you (loved it) XD - an okay story at the beginning. - Hilarious expressions.  Cons: - Crappy textures for the background of the game and it dosent look very good. - Stupid random story, apparently dis was trapped in purgatory for killing his best friends and his classmates but he didnt and it was his teacher who is a demon? She also killed them because they were disobedient and annoying wow teacher of the year. Also Dis leaves purgatory to go visit the place his friends died believing he killed them to mourn for them? Also if she was a teacher how did she become a police officer, get a police cruiser, go to the island after someone who broke into the police scene and know that it was Dis (who she dosent even mention his name just calls him 'the boy I framed for my murderous spree'. How does that make any sense? Also if she is some kind of demon why couldnt she open the big oak door? How did Dis escape purgatory? What actually happened? There are so many holes in plot that werent filled, that were inconsistent or didnt make sense. - There are very few different jumpscares mannequins, gourney, shadows, random noises and moving objects. - Also it was only partially voiced and the voicing was only in japenese. - 2 second sprint is killing me it only last 2 SECONDS and the character is so slow. - You cant get three stars in the game only two, whats the point in having three stars if you can only earn two of them?   I have to admit I did like the pier thing where the pier was falling apart and you had to run while it was falling behind you. But overall the game was stupid and was just thrown together, also why would a demon need to make bombs in order to blow up part of an island and murder a bunch of school kids? none of the plot makes sense and why was there a bomb making thing in Dis's house in purgatory if he wasnt even the murderer in the first place? seriously none of the plot makes sense. I would rate 3/10.",

And speaking of gameplay, there is an increadible 20 minutes of story. 3 massive chapters and a bonus 4th, that has multiplayer that doesn't work! Incredible.  The voice acting was top notch, really clean and well written. The anime Microsoft Sam sounding people were incredible in their work here. They deserve to have much bigger roles in the TV or movie industry.  The visuals were great and really made the game feel very imersive, I felt like I was really there. The VR works incredibly well and I really wanted to touch that hot anime babe in chapter 3.  If you like Amnesia, Slender, Five Nights at Freddy's, or DeviantArt then you'll love this game. 10/10 would meme again",

This arousing stunning game is what all other horror games should look up to as their birth father. The great hd to da max graphics of this game are so good that there is not a computer in existance that can handle these spine tingling graphics, for me to play this game i had to travel to the future with Docter Whom and space eggus to get a computer that could handle this game, and even after that the breath taking graphics of this game still lagged my computer.

This game is what happens when the broken mind of a weeaboo decides to make a game. the scares are nonexistant, and extremely mediocre, it controls alright, but has some quite bad keybindings. Oculus Rift support, to make your 'horror' experience better, which it won't, it'll just nauseate you and make you regret purchasing this mess of a 'game', the multiplayer doesn't even contain third person sprites or models, you just see the other person's footsteps and it's extremely disorienting, not only that, but the map design is just poor and confusing, would not reccomend to anyone.",

If you are scared of loud noises every 10 seconds, and shadows that pop out of nowhere, yet are perfectly harmless, I guess this is right up your alley.  The controls are terrible, you move at a snail's pace, the mouse doesn't disappear until you click something, and you've got this short little 'sprint' that lasts less than a second if you press Q. You need to press it each 2 seconds or so, and it's quite annoying, because it gives you think that you are going faster. (You are, but it's still painfully slow).  The music is meh, the ambient sounds are half creepy, yet they get old rather fast. The voice 'acting' is ATROCIOUS and gets old in less than a minute. It's the same stuff in japanese over and over and over. The first character sound like it was voices with microsoft Sam or something like that.   The art style is unremarkable, it's just ♥♥♥♥ing manga, and it isn't even that good.  Graphics? Typical unpolished low quality unity graphics with endless pitch black darkness in front of you.  Art? Meh.  Sound? Terrible.  Controls? ♥♥♥♥ing terrible.  Plot? As I said, it's a walking simulator, but even still, the plot doesn't even make any sense. It's not even cliche, it's just something that a 10 year old could come up with.  Pros? Well, there are cards, if you are into that. And it's short, so your torture is nice, short and sweet.   Oh, and there's multiplayer, but I don't know if it's broken or not. Good luck finding somebody to play this game with.

It may be fun if you are the person who watches terrible movies to laugh with friends, but as a horror game it isn't all that great. For the price, well I think it may be worth a few laughs with friends. The trading cards make up for the game partially.
