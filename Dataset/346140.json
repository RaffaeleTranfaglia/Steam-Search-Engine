            "review_text": "I wish there was an option to give games a mediocre vote rather than just 'yes' or 'no.' Since there isn't, I'm giving this game bundle a 'yes,' but only barely. Unlike the poster before me, I was able to download and run the games with no trouble (I'm using a laptop with Windows 7). I have different opinions on each game in the bundle, so I'm going to break my review into a section for each game. _________________________________ Mountain Crime Requital. Overall Rating: 3/5  Plot: 2/5. You play a doctor who has been summoned to a secluded mountain resort, under the pretense that the owner has suffered a heart attack. Once there, you realize that the owner is nowhere to be found, and the other guests start turning up dead.  Voice Acting: 0/5. The voice acting in this game is horrid to the point of being remarkable.  Artwork: 3/5. The characters look awful, but if you can ignore them, the overall scenery is decent.  Puzzles and HOS: 4/5. The puzzles aren't bad (some may find them too easy). The hidden object scenes are set up so that you have to locate objects in order to assemble an item you need.The scenes are drawn nicely and are not too dark or full of unnecessary clutter. Occasionally there is an item that has been named strangely due to mistranslation.  Getting Around: 3/5. You are provided with a map of the resort, and when you open it, it will indicate areas in which there are actions to be performed. Unfortunately you cannot click on the areas and be instantly transported, so there is a great deal of backtracking. _______________________ Weird Park: Broken Tune. Overall Rating: 4/5  Plot: 2/5. You play a journalist who is sent to investigate the disappearance of a fellow journalist at an abandoned circus. Once there, you begin having random sightings of a ghost clown and a midget dressed as a harlequin. As for the midget, he is supposed to be more than he seems, and is linked to a broken music record, which you find shards of throughout the game. Although he is supposed to be a major factor in the disappearances, the only interaction you ever have with him is seeing him darting around walls.  Voice Acting: N/A. Your character doesn't have any conversations with anyone.  Artwork: 3/5. The characters leave much to be desired. The overall scenery looks nice though.   Puzzles and HOS: 4/5. The puzzles are pretty good (some may find them too easy). As for the HOS, some are typical HOS, in which you locate various items, while others require you to find broken parts in order to assemble a useful item. The HOS are nicely done.  Getting Around: 1/5. There is no map provided, and there is a great deal of backtracking in order to figure out what you are supposed to do next. ________________________________________ Behind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge. Overall Rating: 0/5. I was unable to complete this game due being unable to find items that are needed in order to progress.  Plot: ?/5. This game is a sequel, so why wasn't the first game in the series included in the bundle? You play a mother who defeated a wicked witch in the first game, and now the witch has used her magic to escape jail, and has absconded with your son’s soul by using mirrors as portals.  Voice Acting: N/A. From what little I did play, there seems to be no voice acting.  Artwork: 3/5. The characters and their animations are poorly done. The scenery itself is nice though.  Puzzles and HOS: 0/5. Unfortunately the niceness of the art is trumped by the issues I (and other players whose comments I found on various forums) have with being able to find items we need to continue playing. The items are often hidden to the point of being too difficult to locate amidst clutter and things of the same color. To make the matters worse, is the hint feature in the game proved useless for me. I got stuck and clicked for a hint. It directed me to go in the church. I went in the church and clicked the hint again. Instead of showing me what to do in the church, it directed me to go back outside, over and over. On top of it all, I could not find a strategy guide anywhere online either.  Getting Around: 1/5. There is no map provided. Plus there is a great deal of backtracking to find items (or parts of items) you need. _______________________________________ Vampire Saga: Pandora's Box. Overall Rating: 4/5  Plot: 3/5. In this game you bounce between playing a young man and his grandfather. You start in the 1950s as the young man getting a bizarre phone call from grandpa, in which he sounds distressed, and is claiming to have just killed a woman. You rush over to his house, and once you make it upstairs, you find grandpa has barricaded the bedroom door with furniture. He is outside the door, still insisting that he has shot a woman. He goes on to indicate that he knows this woman from years ago, and that she has tracked him down. It is then that the gameplay switches, and you are playing grandpa as a young man during the Spanish-American War. He is a deserter, who has stowed away on a ship. Unfortunately this ship is carrying dangerous cargo.  Voice Acting: N/A. The dialogue between characters is all text.  Artwork. 2/5. The characters are expressionless, rigid mannequins. Scenery is okay.  Puzzles and HOS: 2/5. Puzzles are okay (some may find them too easy). The HOS vary in enjoyability. I found myself having to use the hint feature an awful lot because some of the HOS were dark, so items were hard to see. In others the items were hidden behind things to the point only a tiny sliver of the items were visible. In others the items were placed on the very edges of the frame, so they were barely visible. Additionally, there are some items that are incorrectly translated to English.  Getting Around: 2/5. There is no map, and there is a huge amount of back and forth between areas. You will find yourself too often wandering between areas trying to figure out what to do next. In these instances, the hint feature will simply tell you 'There is nothing to do here right now,' instead of directing you to the area you need to be. Sometimes reading your journal will tell you what you need to do, but not often enough. ______________________________________ Twisted Lands: Shadow Town. Overall Rating: 2/5  Plot: 1/5. You play a man who is washed ashore after a boating accident involving him and his girlfriend. The town he discovers is within a dense fog, and is strangely deserted. The man believes his girlfriend must be somewhere on this island, so he embarks on a mission to find her. During his explorations, he finds evidence of a serpent cult, yet journals of missing residents and other shipwrecked people describe victims being transformed into fish folk with gills. I’m trying to see the connection.  Voice Acting: N/A. In this game, the only dialogue is between the protagonist and his girlfriend at the beginning, and it is all done via text.  Artwork: 4/5. Of all the games, I think this one had the best artwork. Though the characters still looked like mannequins. The scenery was very nice.  Puzzles and HOS: 4/5. Puzzles were okay. The HOS were well done- items were detailed, and some cunningly hidden, but still able to be found.  Getting Around: 1/5. There is no map, and there are a lot of different areas to visit, multiple times. So you will spend an enormous amount of time backtracking. The hint feature is helpful in that it will light up an arrow and direct you where to go.  ",

So I have 4 games now to play and they are really enjoyable. If you don't mind to have those problems this is the HOG bundle for you! Buy it when it is on sale., It costed about 5 Euro's.",

            "review_text": "I don't know if the five Hidden Object Games (HOGs) in this 'Hidden Object Bundle 5 in 1' could be considered to be bottom of the barrel. But, they certainly aren't top tier. Of the five games, two of them I found to be unplayable:  - Vampire Saga: Pandora's Box. I stopped playing after 20 minutes. The graphics are too bad (low resolution) so it's very hard to see the objects in HOGs. Also, there are some very blatant translation issues ('founded objects' instead of 'found objects,' 'can't go ashore' instead of 'can't go upstairs').  - Behind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge. The story is so unbelievably bad that brain cells were dying as I played. I had to stop after about a half an hour.  The remaining three games are playable, though not all that good. In increasing order of 'goodness' they are:  - Twisted Lands: Shadow Town: I got about 5.6 hours of almost tolerable gameplay out of this. The biggest problem is that the story is pretty bad and the ending makes no sense. I thought that was because the game is part of a series. But, this is the first in the series (Shadow Town, Insomniac, and Origin). Even ignoring the nonsensical ending on the assumption that it's explained in later games, the story is full of holes (gaps and logic errors). Plus, the protagonist is a cad. Other things: the graphics aren't that great, there's no voice acting, the HOGs are foggy, fairly colorless, and too small (far away? resolution issue?). In-HOG issues: 1) won't accept an actual ships wheel, but will take the shadow of one just below it, 2) an electric fan not acceptable, but a paper fan just in front of it is, 3) a spade is not a shovel, 4) hedge clippers are not pruning shears. Closely related in-story issues are 1) pliers don't cut fences, and 2) a microchip is not RAM. More seriously, at one point there's an open electrical switch (the old Frankenstein type of switch) that works underwater. For game mechanics, the diary sometimes gets populated when entering an area and not necessarily when things are encountered. Also, HOGs get re-activated without story-driven reasons to return to an area. You spend a LOT of time going back and forth across the island retrieving things and just looking to see if a HOG has re-activated.  - Weird Park: Broken Tune: I got about 4.6 hours of tolerable gameplay out of this. There's no voice acting except the introduction narration, but two characters go through speaches with us but they're just text dialog. The graphics are pretty good, the HOGs are good but simple, and most of the mini-games are good. But three were hard for me (square flipping, rotation, and tune memory). One bug I saw was that I needed a hair dryer at one point but it wouldn't let me use it. Exited and restarted and it worked. The biggest problem with the game is the story: it's very weak. The first half is reasonable though thin. But the second half seemed to come out of the blue and just ramble.  - Mountain Crime: Requital: I got about 5.3 hours of tolerable gameplay out of this. First, the good: the HOGs and mini-games are well done (the HOGs are interesting in that they're sort of Fractured Object Games (FROGs) but with whole objects instead of shards). The plot is complex and interesting. Now the bad: even though the plot is interesting, the character behavior getting through the plot is stupid. Plus, the voice acting just horrible. It made me want to tear my ears off. Then there are too many deaths and too many murders (9 in-game murders and several more backstory deaths). The bodies pile up so deep you can't keep the dead straight. But, the penultimate badness is the ending: it's utterly HORRIBLE. I can't explain it here as it would be a massive spoiler. But, ugh. It's terrible.  So, even though there are five games in this bundle and you can get probably more than 16 hours worth of gameplay out of it, at best, that 16 hours won't be well spent. I certainly would never recommend spending the list price on it. Heck. I'm pretty sure I got this 5-in-1 bundle as part of an 8 game bundle and IT was on sale. And, I still don't recommend it.",

            "review_text": "(I'll put my overall opinion at the top for those who don't want to read anything about the individual titles.)   OVERALL:     the bad things first: No Steam Cloud support; as someone who plays on three different computers, this really is a problem; each of these games stores its save files in a different location, which I had to hunt down, and manually copy&amp;paste from computer to computer every time I wanted to continue my game on a different system.     this bundle includes only 'regular versions', although some of the titles have also been released as Collector's or Special Editions; in the Hidden Object genre, this of course means that some of the games may have somewhat of an unsatisfying or evil ending, a more positive or conclusive of which you'd only get by playing the additional content of the CEs/SEs; personally, I didn't care, since none of the games actually feel incomplete, but I thought I'd mention it anyway    graphics and sound range from very good to adequate; there's only one game (Vampire Saga: Pandora's Box) that's actually a bit off-putting in its presentation    CONCLUSION:  The bundle is a decent little treat for fans of Hidden Object Games. If you're not already a fan of those, however, you should probably look elsewhere for a smooth entry, as these games are not really the cream of the crop of the genre. Still, though, you get two good games, two decent ones and only one bad one for a rather low price, which is why I'm giving this a thumbs up despite its shortcomings.    THE GAMES:   Weird Park: Broken Tune  - A strangely bland game, I thought. I really like evil clowns, and an abandoned amusement park sounds like a great setting for a creepy game, but still, I was a bit bored with this one. It felt very much like a by-the-numbers kind of thing, where not a single idea felt fresh or intriguing. Things get slightly more interesting (and surreal) towards the end, but overall, it's an underwhelming game.   Twisted Lands: Shadow Town  - This one's more interesting. Both the setting and the story had me quite intrigued and motivated to keep going (the whole premise is a bit like Lovecraft's Shadow Over Innsmouth). The puzzles, HOGs and minigames are good, too, however, one problem with this game is that some paths between locations are maze-like, and you can *never* skip them. If you find yourself having to walk from Point A to Point B a couple of times and there's a maze section between them, then you will have to click through the maze *every single time*. It's not a major issue, since the mazes are short and easy, but it's still a minor annoyance. Overall, however, a good game with an interesting story.    Mountain Crime: Requital  - My favorite of the bundle. It excels in pretty much all areas: The Hidden Object sections have an interesting little twist to them, the minigame puzzles are well designed, the setting (a recently re-opened grand hotel) and the story (a string of grotesque murders) are intriguing and the presentation compliments the atmosphere. I have no complaints about this one at all.   Vampire Saga: Pandora's Box  - By far the worst game this bundle has to offer, in my opinion. It's a very bare-bones, visually off-putting experience for one thing, with bland environments, bizarrely ugly character models and the barest minimum of item combination puzzles, but the real problem with this one is its actual Hidden Object gameplay. All the HO screens you encounter throughout the game suffer from one issue or another; they're either too dark to adequately see the things you're looking for, or they have a strong color filter that make the items blend in with the backgrounds, or (and this is my personal cardinal sin) they show you *more than one item that matches the description, but only one of them is actually correct. For example, there are screens where you're told to look for 'a brush', but there are at least three different brushes lying around. Another screen has you looking for 'a lamp', but there are four lamps to pick from, and of course you get penalized for too many consecutive wrong clicks. Unless you're a total HOG nut, you might actually want to skip this one altogether. The story has a few interesting and morbid moments, but it's not worth putting up with the bad gameplay, in my opinion.   Behind the Reflection 2: Witch's Revenge  - Very much like Weird Park. There's nothing damningly wrong with it, but the whole experience is rather drab. However, the HO gameplay is well implemented and the presentation is nice enough, so I still had some fun with it. One thing to note: This game's story is very closely tied to its predecessor. You might want to play that one first. ",
