(I still can't believe this game was released back in 2003.)  10/10  - Fantastic Music. (The whole soundtrack was stunning. Perfectly scripted for every situation and utterly magnificent. Stuart Chatwood quickly became one of my favorite music composers.)  10/10  - Charming Voice Acting. (Yuri Lowenthal's voice alone was enough for the top score. The whole adventure is so beautifully narrated, so full of great ideas and outright perplexing figures of speech...)  10/10  - Addicting Gameplay. (A great mix of combat, acrobatic free-running and a some tricky puzzles.)  10/10  - Character Progression. (The game constantly updates the player with new powers, weapons and even clothing.)  10/10  - Diverse and Unique. (This game has some of the most beautiful surroundings I ever seen. Lots of unique enemies and locations to discover.)  10/10   This game is pure gold. The characters not only look amazing but they also feel... Alive. Totally different, each with it's own moral standing and their way of thinking. There is this good feeling when playing this game. Both the Prince and Farah are behaving as natural as it could get. They are very distant at the beginning, unmoved, cold. But as they make progress, they develop this feeling of mutual respect. Later on they become good friends. Joking and taunting each other in a very loving way. Check this monologue here:   'She said my love... I know she did. I didn't dream it... at least I think I didn't... It's quite natural really, her Kingdoms' conquered, she has nothing, no one to protect her. She needs me! I can see it in the way she looks at me. All I'd have to do is... Reach out and, take her hand... And she'd be mine! Why am I talking to myself ?!'   I have beat the game at least 5 times. Don't mind my Steam playing time. It was before I had purchased it here. And I don't regret a thing.  This game offers and unforgetable adventure. If you haven't still played it, do it. The best game in the franchise in my opinion.      10/10 ",

            "review_text": "The Gold Egg of the trilogy.  Time travel, parkour, and puzzles. This game does those 3 best. The combat is fairly simple and straightfoward, you can swing your sword, use your dagger, block, jump over enemies, and whatnot.   Puzzles are fairly straightforward and challenging.  And then you have several time altering powers using the Dagger of Time, you have your:  Recall: Reverse time for up to several seconds, usually for saving you from heavy damage, screwing up on a jump or puzzle, or instant deaths.  The Eye of the Storm: Slows down time and makes combat and some puzzles/platforming/parkouring easier.  Enemy Freeze: Renders an enemy frozen in time and much easier to kill.  Frozen Time Assault: Freeze time and go into a badass Omnislash-like frenzy on multiple enemies and wreak havoc.  All time powers require either a sand tank, or a halfmoon depending on which power it is. You fill up sandtanks and halfmoons by finishing enemies with the Dagger of Time.  One of my favorite parts in the game I remember is the bats, who always retreat in groups of 3 when you kill a bunch. My brother would always yell 'THREE RETREAT!' and I would always laugh.  Man... I wish I would of kept my Gamecube copy of the game I got back in 2003 that my dad got me for Christmas... because... them nostalgias.  The PC version of this game seems to hold up pretty well (at least on XP anyway).  It's a classic game and is pretty badass in general, give it a try sometime.",

Besides all that the game is very solid, the story is great, and the graphics still hold up (albeit barely).

            "review_text": " PROS:  + awesome fairy tale story + great work with narrative + save point system + puzzles, especially the ones with Farah + parkour with dagger time rewind + cutscenes + no uPlay   CONS:  - graphical glitches - clunky combat - after a while the guard fighting gets repetitive - really REALLY wobbly camera - audio can go out of sync in rare occassions   Comment:  An epic, although sometimes clunky, introduction to the classic Sands of Time trilogy. For me also introduction to Ubisoft games. And I really liked it. The story is awesome and has that fairy tale feeling to it. This is especially due to the fact that the game is mostly played in the past and is a story told by the narrator. So if you die the commentator says that this is not what happened and starts from a checkpoint. I love this and it makes it unique. The combat is fun for a while but having to battle guards over and over can get repetitive. But this game is more about the jumping, platforming, climbing and dodging. The parkour here is only flawed by the VERY weird camera shifting that killed me more times than enemies did. Luckily there is the dagger of time so you can rewind those mistakes. However it needs to be recharged so you have a limited number of tries. Overall a very cool game that has some bugs and annoying parts which mostly fade next to the epic story telling and puzzles. Recommended!   P.S.:  the low game time is due to playing this game way back and just trying it out here if it works, which it mostly does although I had to disable Fog to see anything...",

            "review_text": "Prince of Persia is an old game. That much is obvious. However it is more than worth it. The first to bring up the idea of rewinding time to fix your mistakes in parkouring instead of killing you instantly. Like plenty of platforming games of its' time a single mistake would normally send you to a quick death. With the time mechanics of PoP if you have the available resources you can go back and fix those mistakes. The combat is simple yet satisfying when you survive a horde of sand monsters. With a unique health recovery system of drinking water stumbling upon a basin of water or pool is like finding an oasis in the desert. While Prince of Persia is a classic game it has a few problems.   The biggest one is sometimes the controls don't work too well on a mouse and keyboard. With the health system you can go a long time with low health and end up suffering a few frustrating deaths multiple times. There are also a few enemies that are lackluster (crows, scarabs) that get annoying. This is compounded by a short animation that plays of your character putting his weapons away that you can't skip. The last con is that save points have you seeing a vision of a possible future. While it is a neat way of giving you hints there are far too many that are close to each other.   To sum it up Prince of Persia is the start of a good series that hit a home run despite the few problems it has. If you want a classic platformer this is the game for you with crazy contraptions and fun applications of platforming. This game is plenty of fun.",

I was ready to uninstall it before I could even get the Sands of Time. This may be a shoddy port like all of Ubisoft games these days, or this game has just aged horribly.

The game is insanely linear. The entire game is a rinse and repeat cycle. You go from point A to point B in a serious of platforming stunts, then you enter a room with endlessly spawing enemies where you must block or attack or dodge for about 10 minutes. There is no feeling of progression, you dont get cool weapons or armor or anything to make you want to keep playing.  My advice is to stay far away from this. The entire Tomb Raider series does this type of precision platforming style so much better. Even the original 1996 Tomb Raider is so much better than this.",

HOWEVER, some jumping is woefully inaccurate, the camera can be a pain in the ♥♥♥ sometimes, puzzles are 90% easy, but 10% of the time you wonder just where the hell you are supposed to even go.  And now my biggest bug bear - combat: It would have been better to just remove it completely, because it is SO bad. You get to fight 10-20 enemies in each encounter. They respawn if you don't kill them quickly (a dagger finishing move you have to perform on every beaten enemy). They teleport after you, they swarm you and surround you, and when you're down on the floor you're as good as dead. That being said, most enemies are cannon fodder and dispatched easily enough, but some enemies (blue ones) can't be vaulted over, and they hit hard and fast, compared to the rest of the enemies. These are insanely frustrating since they make up most of the enemies encountered after the first quarter of the game. Combat is uninspired and irritating. As if that wasn't reason enough to hate it, you also have to keep an eye out on your companion, who inexplicably is NOT AT ALL able to move out of harm's way, meaning she will not move...at all, and frequently die, because she thinks she can take on a 3 meter sand monster with her bow and arrow in close combat...*sigh*. The game would be easier without her 'help'.  Apart from that it's still an entertaining, albeit quite old, game.",

Only on a second or third try he had enough of dying and made the jump.  The absence of subs with the VERY low voice audio at times will make you miss out on some dialouges. In the end despite its flaws if you are looking to relive the adventure of the prince you wont be disappointed but because of some annoying audio issues and clunky camera/controls I will give it a 7/10.",

The voice-acting is excellent and the Prince is a pretty cool character to play as, the story is great as well. The visuals are low-quality compared to today, but that's because it came out a full 11 years ago.   My only gripes would be the wonky camera that sometimes gives you these terrible angles when you want to jump from place to the next and trying to fight monsters, it's just annoying. The combat is not very good as well, it's rather repetitive and unspiried. You can do some cool moves like kick off walls to do a leap strike or vault over a monster, but after a while, the euphria of it all wears off. Monsters will surround you in these large mobs then knocking you down on the ground, and because the getting up animation is so long, they can just combo you to death without you even getting a chance to hit back, it's pretty rage-inducing. You can work around the combat, just be sure to use the dagger of time and don't let yourself get mobbed.   These flaws, however, do not detract very much from the overall game and can be overlooked pretty easily. Prince of persia is the perfect game if you're looking to get into action platforming or hoping to revisit the good 'ol days when we used to play Mario, Jak and Dexter and ratchet and clank and the like.

That being said, this is the first one, meaning they hadn't necessarily caught their stride yet. Its definitely still worth the play, but not every mechanic is well done. Only one comes to mind, when I say this: combat.  Combat feels awful: its wave after wave of the same enemies, for no real purpose. It doesn't really make it hard, just frustrating; the idea is, eventually between the 30 baddies we throw your way, you're going to slip up and get hit. If you're really unlucky, it will be in a cluster you can't hope to escape. Oh, and to make sure its possibly to get you in that cluster, we're going to give you someone to protect, so you better engage everyone. Finally, that combo you just pulled may have knocked him down, but the final blow still needs to be dealt, and good luck getting that off with 3 enemies clustered around you. If I could, I'd yank out every instance of combat and throw it away, and the game would be better for it.  Platforming is really where the game shines: it basically invented modern day 3d platforming, and those mechanics still feel tight. This is what I play the game for, and where most of the fun will come.  The puzzles are nothing special, for sure. Its your standard 'pull the switches in this order' or 'redirect the beams of light' puzzles; uninspiring for the modern gamer, but it gets the job done.  All in all, its a classic: you should probably play it at least once. The story is solid if a bit uneventful, and even the dialog isn't terrible.",

A harsh lesson is learned by the prince, Never trust a man who has betrayed his own kin, as he'll betray you himself.

Platforming is as fun as it has always been, although the combat gets a bit lengthy at times. All in all the combat is really not that bad (even though it possibly being the weakest aspect of the game). I definitely recommend you checking it out if you're into well designed climbing puzzles and awesome looking visuals (from a level design and architecture standpoint, not so much high-res textures and high-poly models obviously) - and don't mind getting stuck here and there.  Played it as a kid and it's still just as good today, if not even better.",

Also, the controls are really responsive to commands, so you can really feel like you're moving the Prince all around at high speed. Highly recommend with a controller though to get the most enjoyment.",

The game itself runs well but using my gamepad it does have trouble registering button hits when trying to use certain sand powers. Not sure why it had trouble but at least for me it didn't take away from the experience.",
