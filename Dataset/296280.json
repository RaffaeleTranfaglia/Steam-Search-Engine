I saw the man standing there and thought:'Hey little guy, what can i do in this game?' I clicked on a tree and the game gave me stick... A stick? 'Where is the wood?' I thought. Instead of clicking a tree, i clicked on a pile of stones. It gave me a little stone. I saw an icon on the right... It was the crafting menu. I thought:' Hey, can't i make an axe out of that?'.   First of: I like this game. The idea of building a big town, offer jobs to get materials faster, Selling things you dont need to buy things you need, being a farmer and grow crops...  There are a few bugs of course (2..) but not not really bad ones... Its not crashing, not lagging ,no nothing. Just a game with a lot of potential... Great job guys ! PS: The game just came out on steam so dont cry please, it will be fixed soon ! (I think ;D)",

Avatar can't be modified strangely questee never stayed around to for you finish the quest?? -&gt; help others finish your quests recommend placing your stockpile near the road with torch nearby. There are no mobs that attack you I don't really see path recipe in future help hinder tree growth.  Avatar or your character never sleeps, eats or passes out.   Music 7/10 Game play mechanics basing it on tutorial that was fun the secondary needs work. 1) 9/10 and 2) 4/10 secondary story got harder to work on, because income making was important really they should cover that in tutorial.",
