Not the best or worst word search game (a word search book is easier) in the world, you get what you pay for in this game and can be confusing at the start.  There's no option menus for anything, no instructions and not even simple labels at the start to see where to click which 'world'.  5/10 Giving negitive feedback, cause no option to recommend yes and no at the same time.",
