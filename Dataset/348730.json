I love the concept of the game. The graphic is making progress on improvement right now, looks good,  Hope the game will runs more smoothly in the following patches.(Can be just because I'm using laptop though...)   ",

            "review_text": "A good idea, but poorly executed. Instead of having a static base, you are movable and have to stop the train of monsters. The problem with that is you can't get to the Relic resources some of the time, because your towers are not powerful enough, or your gun can't keep up with the waves without the towers - so the more you progress the slower you progress until you are either a) stuck or b) pushed back. With no options to upgrade you towers/guns/weapons/shields/traps while playing (you can only do the BEFORE the mission), it pretty much ruins the game. If they added a pause or slow down mechanic where you could open the store for upgrades then this would be a beast of a game. As it is, it begins to disappoint around level 4. It's fun to play so it gets a positive rating, but it still needs a bit of work. 5/10 Dragons.",
