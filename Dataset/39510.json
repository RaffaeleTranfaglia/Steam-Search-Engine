The graphics are fine considering this game is from 2002. It has a stunning open world, a well written story and again is just as amazing as Gothic I.  Gothic III lost quite a bit of the series' charm and we don't talk about Gothic IV here. Even worse. Also both Risen games are no match for this master piece.",

            "review_text": "This is by far the best game you will ever play. I have personally never played a better RPG. I will now go into detail about why this is the best way to spend your money on a game.  First of all the story: If you have played Gothic 1 you will get to meet many of your old friends again. I personally played Gothic 1 after Gothic 2, and it didn't matter alot. Most of the dialogues give you the option to navigate around having met them before (in Gothic 1), but I surely do encourage you to play Gothic 1 before since it will greatly improve your enjoyment when meeting your old brothers again. The story continues perfectly with twists and new problem and adventures to explore. Honestly, the story is probably the best thing about this game, it just makes you love the characters, form realtionships, go on quests together and knock on baddies heads.  Now to the Wolrd and its design: Epic. That's the only word you need to describe Gothic 2s' worlds. Piranha Bytes has the best team when it comes to creating maps. Every inch is used to its maximum potential, there are a big variety of different locations, each one unique and special in some way. In every corner there is a secret to discover or a unknown Boss-Mob to defeat. In Gothic 2s' worlds every step feels special, there is always something you didn't notice on your first walk along a path.  Furthermore to the gameplay: Gothic isn't a game that babysits you through your playtime. You get thrown into the cold water (literally in Gothic 1 :) ), noone is there to show you where to go for a quest, no markers on your UI, no markers on the maps, nothing. It just feels like you are really in that world, wandering around not knowing where to go or who you will meet behind the next turn. It surely is a hardcore RPG experience, the controls might feel weird at first, but you will get the hang of it quiet fast. The combat might seem a little hard at the start, you will feel like your hero is good for nothing, you will get beat up alot. You are weak at the start, but once you get your first proper sword and armor, you can wreck **** up!  Gothic has a basic, but good level and skill system. Though I must say it's strongly unbalanced without the proper mods installed (I will get to that later). You can do anything that is possible in a medieval world: Fight with one-handed and two-handed swords, use bows and crossbows, shoot magic bolts, summon undead creatures or let fire rain upon your enemies.  A few personal notes about the game: I almsot can't describe the game in words, it's just the most epic, legendary, bestest, amazingest game you will ever play. If you don't give a damn about graphics like me and just play for the gameplay and the story, then this is perfect for you. Just ignore the graphics ( they were good for the time the game was first released ), once you are in a playsession nothing will matter to you but the game and the story. You will have at least 50 hours of pure joy during the story, if you only play through the story, if you suck out the maximum potential of the game you can spend atleast 300 hours trying out different guilds, different character skilling, exploring side-quest ( there is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ), or just wandering in the wildness slaying mobs and gazing at the epicness of this game. I think the addon could've been implemented better into the game. I am saying this as someone who has played the game withouth the addon first. I just didn't feel it in the addon, it seemed a little empty, but it surely offers A TON OF AWESOME LOOT and more old friends from Gothic 1 to meet. It just didn't, didn't do it, if you know what I mean, it felt kinda sloppy. The world could've been used more in the addon, more like the main map.  Now to the comability issues everyone is talking about: If you think it just buy game, download, play, you are mistaken, soooooo deeply msitaken. It is incredibly hard to get this game running if you have no idea how 'modding' works, or if you are installing the game for the first time. You need 3 different communitypatches at least and a ton of configuring the game files. Thanks to the community over at WorldOfGothic though its not that hard, they helped me install it a couple of times too. It is definitly worth the trouble though, this game is so incredibly epic it just has to be played. Continueing on that is the bad balancing the addon brings in, I STRONGLY advise to install a rebalancing mod (I use minimod balance), because the level/skill system is stupid in the normal state ( you will notice yourself though).   Finishing this long post: Gothic 2 is the best game ever created and anyone not playing it is missing out on alot.  Thanks for reading my rather long review, it is my first and I just couldn't express how I feel about the game.. P.S.: sorry for any spelling-errors, am too tired to proof read this ;P",

            "review_text": "Gothic 2 is arguably my favourite RPG, and has been for many years. It features exiting fights, lots of different skills, three different 'paths' to choose from, and loads of things to discover.  First, the positive: Gothic 2 is much smoother than Gothic 1. It's easier to use, less clunky, and merchants are easier to deal with now that gold is introduced as opposed to trading items all the time. Timing is important during fights, but so is picking your opponent.  Gothic 2 doesn't hold your hand at any stage of the game: if you make the mistake of wandering into the woodland armed with a wooden stick at level one, well, it's your funeral. The NPC's give advice, though, but you'll have to find them and ask them.  You'll also have to build your character from the ground up: you start with a little health, and a huge problem the game needs you to solve. Levelling always feels important and vital to the game, be it your stats or your gear. The game makes every improvement you make feel valuable. This is because if you don't level up and face something stronger than you, chances are you're going to die.  All this makes playing the game incredibly rewarding. I felt genuinely satisfied every time I accomplished something, because I worked for it. Gothic won't punish you by being overly difficult: it'll just make you work.  But just in case you get too stressed grinding through the game, don't worry. After you get strong enough, you'll find some enemies easy to throw around if you skip around some of the earlier stages of the game you missed before. Destroying things that once scared the pants off you makes everything feel better. This feeling will dissapear if you accidentally stray next to a higher level enemy quite quickly though, keeping an incredibly fun cycle of victim and bully going strong until the end of the game: it never gets dull. Either you're happy and feel like a boss, or you're running for your life, and it's not something a game does for me often.  Exploration is also rewarding: loads of secrets are hidden all around the world. Some of the best items and deadliest enemies lurk where you wouldn't expect. Sometimes quest items or NPC's can be hidden in the middle of the countryside, but unlike Skyrim, you can't follow a little arrow on your compass until you come across it. Find it on your own.  As for the world itself, it's an open world, but that doesn't mean you can go anywhere you want. Higher level monsters lurk in some areas and mountains and cliffs box you in a lot of the time. This means that over a small area, there can be a lot of stuff that's hidden: under an ordinary country road could be a huge cave full of glorious, glorious loot, but at the same time, on top of the cliff to your left might be an epic monster, and you'd never even know unless you looked.  Now, the bad: I had problems getting Gothic 2 to work on my computer. Whilst I eventually got it to work, it's a messy problem that took a patch to fix. There may be betters ways to get the game than on Steam.  Night of the Raven messed with the levelling system a lot. Before, I found the game to be difficult, but fair. Not so much now: items need much higher strength to use. This means you have to gain more levels just to use a sword you could previously use at a lower level. You also end up needing to go up even more levels to gain more stats, which was frustrating considering that I was having a hard enough time facing orcs before Night of the Raven. I didn't really appreciate the content it brought to the game either: in a world of dragons, knights, and medieval monsters, I didn't really think that pirates or aztec temples really fit. There was great nostalgia value from meeting some of the characters from Gothic 1 in the expansion, though, but I didn't feel they balanced the stuff I didn't like enough. If Gothic came without Night of the Raven, I would have much preferred that... either that or I became a bad player over these past few years (which I doubt).  Finally, the gameplay might not please some people. I spent a long time praising Gothic 2 for being difficult and rewarding, but for a more casual player, it may be a bit too brutal to get used to. The fighting system isn't the same as anything I've ever seen, and it isn't the most fluid to use. Sure, with practice, you get it, but you may not necessarily want to.   And now, my closing statement: Gothic 2 is a classical fantasy RPG that combines some of my favourite tropes from the genre: wizards, knights, and epic, evil, hard to kill, not-at-all-watered down DRAGONS, but without making it feel too generic. The wizards (oh, I'm sorry... fire magicians) feel halfway between priests, scientists, and diplomats, and the dynamic between the paladins and the mercenaries is really well done. Choices you make have some of the most unexpected consequences making choosing a path truly unique and giving the game some great replayability.  Gothic 2 with Night of the Raven: 8/10 Gothic 2 in all it's glorious alone-ness: 10/10",

If you haven't played the last one, do that first. This game picks up right where the Gothic 1 left off. The world is very open, full of hidden secrets and relateable characters. If you enjoy medieval RPGs like Skyrim, do yourself a favor and give Gothic 1 &amp; 2 a shot.   Just a note, it has some compatibility errors with modern OS and graphics cards, but it is fairly well patched by the community. Just be prepared to do a little Googling for fixes.",

            "review_text": "Probably one of the greatest generic fantasy RPG's.  If only bethesda did exploration and progression like these guys.  The game design so contrasts with what you'd find in, say, skyrim or oblivion.  For starters, there's no level scaling on enemies, and there is a HUGE power difference between them. For example in the starting area, you're mostly fighting wolves, but there's also an Orc, which are NOT to be ♥♥♥♥ed with at this point. They are twice your size, and hit like a steaming train. But like a train can be sidestepped quite easily.  With perseverence and cunning, you can defeat foes that you normally shouldn't be able to, instead of just standing in place hacking away at an enemy that's designed to die by you just standing and hacking at it. If you know what I mean.  Anyways, exploration is also greatly rewarded, for example you can find a huge bag of gold coins behind some random tree (and gold is a pretty big deal in this game, its not just for buying generic longsword +2 ♥♥♥♥) or get a finely crafted sword from an expert fighter's grave that was hidden in a makeshift mausoleum inside a cave that was swarming with giant cave-dwelling carapiece-plated bugs.  Yeah it's a pretty cool game, wish more games went this route with game design, the effort in -&gt; pay out make it so much more damn satisfying than generic bland grey difficulty all the way through.",

            "review_text": "Gothic II, like the first one is a really great and underrated game. The gameplay is different from other RPGs such as The Elder Scrolls, Not everyone may like it but it is good. The game can be really confusing sometimes, the quests, the map, pretty much everything but the game itself is really awesome, It's different from the other RPGs which is a plus. Just 2 things I do not like which are the freeroam and the ending. Do not except The Elder Scrolls or even a Fallout game, it's open world but at the same time it's linear. You cannot continue after the ending, not even a new game plus.  Those are 2 big flaws that are common in the games made by Piranha – Bytes. For some, it could be positive but for a gamer like me, they are both flaws. It's pretty much the same for every Gothic and Risen games, just that some have a better story, gameplay, items etc than the others.  If it was truly open world with unlimited freeroam and we would be able to continue playing after the end, I would probably give it a 9.5/10 but since it is not the case I'm giving it a 9/10   My favorite list:  1. Gothic II 2. Gothic 3. Risen 4. Gothic III 5. Risen 2: Dark Water 6. Arcania: Gothic 4 (I wouldn't consider this one as a Gothic game though)  They are all good In my opinion, but some are more worth than the others, of course, they all have their good and bad.

The inventory interface is easier to navigate, the combat is more responsive, and the quests are both more numerous and less prone to glitching. The factions and classes are more intertwined, and stay relevant longer than they did in the first game. It certainly has more replayability.  It's a difficult experience. Some of it comes from the constant group encounters with what still feels like a one-on-one combat system, and having to safespot is never fun, but it also preys on the player's ignorance. It isn't necessarily a bad thing; The player has the freedom to distribute learning points however he or she wishes. However, this freedom can result in a gimped character whose flaws won't become apparent until late in the game. Like most RPGs, it will be easier, yet more predictable, on a second playthrough.  It's not a bad game, despite its remaining problems. It shows a distinct improvement and better use of its engine than its predecessor, and will entertain for hours on end.",

So you basically can play 3 classes, which are all unique and fun. You kinda have the Mercenary/Dragonhunter who is using his weapons only. The Mage who is using only Magic and the Knight/Paladin who can use the Paladin Magic and the Paladin weapons, which are very strong and not available to the other classes/factions. Most of the time i played without the Expansion, so the game was quite 'easy'. With the expansion, the game gets preeeettyyy tough and takes a lot more dedication and a lot more completion of sidequests to reach the late game content. You also have to be aware when to go for the new questlines with the pirates, because it has a fixed level range and if you are alrdy too high level it may be a lot less fun to play. The Expansion is great though, because it serves a complete new map with 2 more factions, you cant really join them, but you can do quests there and get some really cool items. Also its the first steps to the Pirate scenario that started with the game 'Risen'. To me this game is one of the best RPG of all time. May be a bit cooler for germans because of the unique dialogues and overall harsh language.  They put a lot of love in the game and it shows.",

            "review_text": "Gothic 2 is alright overall. I can't say it's the best thing to ever come out because there are a lot of games currently out that are just simply better. What I can argue is that Gothic 2 is still entertaining and if it comes on sale again like it did (I bought it in a bundle wit all the Gothic games December 2013 getting a great steam sale deal.) It would definitely be worth picking up. The game is of a free roam style but still nothing like The Elder Scrolls and doesn't seem to have anywhere near the amount of content that The Elder Scrolls have nor does it have the same amount of exploration for you to do. What it does have are pain in the ♥♥♥ npcs that will 1 shot you on sight that you will have to learn to avoid until you reach a higher level and gear up in order to get any fun out of this game. Gothic 2 can be unforgiving and frustrating so I wouldn't recomend it if you're the kind of person who cusses out other players on Call of Duty, hurls controllers across the room on a frequent basis or makes death threats when he/she is angry. It also suffers from the occasional drastic frame rate drop (Which are limited to specific areas from what I could see 2 different spots are like this) or freeze which may require you to restart your comuter because you will not be able to get into the menu to quit the game. Overall despite it's flaws I still enjoyed it and i'm still having fun with it. So to sum it all up I guess i'd say 5.5/10 better than average far from perfection but a very enjoyable game.",

            "review_text": "Nominated for The 'Test of The Time' Award 2016 Gothic 2 with the add-on The Night Of The Raven is truly a masterpiece of an rpg. The story, the voiceacting, the melee fighting mechanics, the vast and diverse world is one of a kind. Gothic 1 should be played before this game, so you wont have trouble understanding the story ( and gothic 1 is fantastic game as well ).  Pros - This game is a true open-world rpg. You can visit the vast majority of places in the world without story developing into those regions - The melee fighting mechanic is very well constructed. The combos are really fun execute. The AI meelefighters are also masterfully done. You will understand in a very short time, that you are facing a true blademaster. The parries, dodges and combos the enemies can do makes the fighting experience something beyond many rpg games i have played. - The magic in the game is diverse. Healing, summoning, teleportation, elemental, status effect you have everything in this game. The AI mages usually use low level spells, but sometimes you encounter your usual enemy mage casting one the strongest fire spells if you allow him to execute the spell in time.  - The story is fantastic. Very well written, very well coordinated through npcs, augmented with side-quests helping you get through the main story. - The side quest are what makes this game on the best in its time. - The voice acting is fantastic ( especially the german) - The integration of the gothic 1 characters is smoothly done. They fit right in where you will find them here in gothic 2 - The world is wonderfully constructed, each new region has a center plaza to rotate easily between places of importance. Different terrain in nearly all the new places you encounter. Vast number of monsters. Huge number of npcs. The npcs with no names ( eg. a novice) has speech option, where he or she will give a different responses to the different events happening in the world of khorinis at that time - Replayable through different faction selections. - Fantastic world and boss music  Cons - Minor logic mistake with npc equipments - Playing as a mage in add-on is very hard. This is very sad, because some of the add-on introduced spells are very fun to use ( the normal G2 mage is still fine) - Some of the boss battles are not working properly, the patterns leave open a lot of abuses for archers and mages to exploit. - There are still some bugs for unlimited gold if you have the time to do it multiple times. ( nothing gamebreaking )  Overall i give this game a 10/10  One of the best rpg ever made, the best open-world rpg in my opinion and it should on every top x rpg list for the next 50+ years . And yes i love this game .. Dont let my 30 hours played mislead you i have played this game at least 20 times",

Those are some things that I didn't like very much about the game.  -Has easter eggs hidden in the game about a martian! -Can become a master mage/necromancer and summon a bunch of skeletons (army) and demons, golems and so on and attack the city!  this is one of the most fun games I ever played in my life.",

            "review_text": "I've started my journey in amazing wold of Gothic from the 3rd chapter. I found Gothc 3 like something unusual and exciting (It'was my first RPG game for my life). After 2 years, Skyrim came out and Everybody in my city played it. But after some ours you became to understand that nothing happens in the world: NPCs are immortal, quests're boring and ordinary as you 've finished 5 minutes ago, this typical graves and caves with long halls and short backdoor exits, You've won the war, completed the main quest and what would happen? Nothing!!! Absolutely nothing! The game'd be the same like after escape from Helgen.  HHHMM............., I typed the big introduction, just don't mind.  I played Gothic 2 in 2015 and this graphic doesn't care me. So I got it, I understood it, I reached it from first minutes, this feeling of 'the best RPG of all ages'! This game has all stuff which is needed for carrying this rank. I mean all (even a good Graphic if you add Direct X11 mode)! You always will be in danger, any animal can kill you (except meatbugs and sheep of course ; ) ), so, you always keep this tension through the whole game. Every step, decision change something in this world. You don't have this marks on the map (like in most modern games) which means destinations of something or somebody. Do you have a brain? Of course yes! Just train it! Just DOOO it! : ) You have to remember every small detail in conversations to reach the aim! Nothing's impossible ; ). Many quests in Gothic can be completed more than one way (including the way of killing NPC, who gave this quest, too).  Starting this game, you may notice the strange control settings in movement, you could be angry about them but don't make panic, after some ours I'll understand all advantages of this movement. In conclusion, I'd like to say this's the best RPG game on my opinion, you can agree or be in disagreement, no matter. I hope you'll enjoy your journey as me.",

            "review_text": "Out of The Gothic Trilogy and the Risen Trilogy, this game is the best. I don't know if it being the first of all of them I played has anything to do with it but the game is so full and alive, with the expansion even more so. Throughout the entire game I was completely submerged into the world.   It has a medievil and magical theme with orcs, mages, paladins, bandits and dragons and an ongoing war. It has a sort of old school structure regarding gameplay yet brings something unique too. It's quite a difficult game to describe to people who haven't played it yet.   It's not really essential to have played Gothic 1 beforehand to enjoy it (I didn't either) but it adds to the background story of the world and has some very nostalgic quests if you have played Gothic 1.  As a traditional RPG. which focuses on quests and the depth of the world around you, you don't create your own visually personalised hero. I find this a much better approach to an RPG, you don't need to know who the person was before and visually it really doesnt matter - you just dive into this world and create your own memories with the character. It makes you feel more like you are in the game yourself.  There are 3 factions and each are as interesting as the other, although I find joining the military is the most basic questline, the mercs are a bit more challenging, and with the expansion the mages are almost like a hard difficulty.  Speaking of gameplay and difficulty this is a game that doesn't hand everything to you. You have to listen to what people say, almost go sherlock holmes on some characters and explore the world within reason at your level (save often!).   For those who haven't played it, please, please give it a go. Please don't compare to the elder scrolls, it is a different game entirely. Go into the game with a curious and open mind.
