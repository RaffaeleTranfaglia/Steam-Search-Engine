            "review_text": "Beyond Reality is a very solid rpg that follows the classic style ---- featuring the same mechanics and the same elements but with a different visual style that works very well and is easy to learn and get into the game immediately. Several choices are offered at the beginning to suit your personal taste including screen size and even the selection of 'fantasy' or 'modern' names for your characters. So make your choices and get into an interesting, imaginative, and absorbing story.  As you begin you are taken back 2000 years in time to a land called Jastamune to resolve the complications of the conflict taking place ---- not much time to ponder the why, just start the quest through differing locations such as caves, mines, forests, and castles ---- all of which have different treasures and secrets to find. You can fight the battles you choose among the many types of enemies or escape (if you're quick). You'll want to explore very carefully, though, to find all the treasures containing weapons, money, potions, etc.  Scenery is beautifully done, and the music is varied and excellent throughout the game.   So give this one a chance ---- especially at the very reasonable sale price ---- and you'll have a winner. Recommended, for sure. ",

            "review_text": "Got this game on sale for $3.49, but I would've paid full price for it. VERY good storyline, fun characters, and you can eventually mix and match your party to suit your playing style. Final boss fight was actually tough (I died the first time, but was successful the second). Even if you only beat it once, it's still worth the price.",

            "review_text": "I love the cover art/promotional material for this game, but man...  *PROS* - Sleek GUI/Menu - Attention to detail (footprints, added effects, etc.) - Lovely mapping (for the most part)  *CONS* - Poor story progression/character development   EXPANSION : You're thrown into this game - and so many random things happen within the first 15 minutes you're going to have next to no clue what's going on. A bad dream with no relevance really, a girl in a crystal (where that came from I don't even know), an S-Rank spell that transports you back in time and disingenuous reactions to that situation just made me go 'uh...' - I mean, it just all seems so poorly fleshed out/cheesy. And why is the 'most powerful mage in the world' far less powerful than your second recruited mage? - Dialogue needs some polishing.   EXPANSION : It's not awful, don't get me wrong - but there's a lot of repetition and name-dropping which makes the dialogue rather boring at times. My advice to the dev is to implement some flavor text/exploration-based text throughout to strengthen the lore/situational awareness (like why Asha was in the crystal...that happened far too quickly). - Bugs. Mostly with passability (having to restart game because the guard won't move past you in Herador) - but I had a script error in battle that I wasn't able to replicate. - Boring battles   EXPANSION : The 'attack, get hit' repetition goes on far too long in most battles - maybe they get better as you progress and unlock new abilities? I'll have to see...   I was really excited for this - and kind of sad that it fell so short. I'm going to continue playing - and hopefully I find some charm/a reason to fall in love...but as it stands right now - I can't recommend this one.",
