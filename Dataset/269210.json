        {
            "review_text": " Hero Siege  is like  Diablo  stripped to its core, with some  The Binding of Isaac -like rogue elements added as spices. It's a top-down action hack 'n slash with 16-bit graphics, to be played as one of seven distinct characters, each with their own abilities and skills. During one's walk around the arena, there's gold and (some) loot to be picked up, there are (many) monsters to be slain, and every six levels, a boss (some amazingly easy, some excruciatingly difficult) awaits you. Levels and enemies are random-generated from a relatively large numer of possibilities, which guarentees a lot of differentiation. There are - very Diablo-like.. - several chapters, each chapter having 30 (!!) levels. So far, so good: the idea is sound, the graphics are fun although a bit blurred, and the gameplay - if using an Xbox 360-like controller - is as fluid as one could hope for.  But  Hero Siege  also has its share of problems. The 'rpg-light'-like leveling system, with stats- and skill-points to be distributed as one levels up, is way too unbalanced. Stats go only up by fractions of percentages, making it fairly useless to upgrade them, except maybe from level 50 or so on. Action skills are sometimes VERY powerful after a time, which will be necessary - but some are really over-the-top. Opposed to this, the amount of damage one can get while playing, is completely unpredictable. This is by itself a good thing, but some bullet-firing skulls deal such an amount of damage, that during the first six levels at least, you can die in an instant without even knowing what hit you. The graphics tend to hide these skulls sometimes, and that makes it really frustrating. It's not funny to get killed out-of-the-blue without even having a hint of what hit you. Though I have to admit, once at a certain level (certainly from 31 upwards), these devils can be survived better. Power-ups, dropped by the bosses, are really essential to survive for a longer time - but since they drop randomly as well, some games are fun because of the great assets they give, others are really disappointing since you didn't get anything worthwhile for a long time.  The good thing is that the developers are still finetuning things, and taking comments from the community into consideration, as far as I can see. That's why I give this game a thumbs-up, even if I've cried out sometimes in frustration when my poor newly-made marksman got out of the blue hit once more by a deadly bullet. What should really be implemented is a better save system: relics (power-ups) tend to get lost once I quit the game, and saving is actually only possible every act (30 levels). This game has potential, is strangely addictive (although the 152 (!!!) Steam achievements seem like impossible to get), but still has serious flaws. Luckily, the developers are still finetuning and working on it.  UPDATE (08/15)  Being curious about how the game looks and plays now, almost I year later, I started it up again, to find out some things have been improved indeed. The levelling system seems much more balanced now, there are new chapters &amp; classes and the overall feel is more polished. However, once in-game I quickly stumbled upon the 'old problems': some enemies/bullets can still kill you instantly, and since you can't always see them coming through the mayhem this really is bothering. Overall though, I find the game to have improved significantly over the past year. The large amount of achievements has been turned down a notch or two, so that it's easier to get a reasonable number of achievements overall.   Conclusion: recommended, but not for the casual gamer looking for some easy fun ",

Then, like all the other reviewers with negative reviews have said, the game mechanics break due to incredibly large numbers of things (your health, your damage, monster count, and massive amounts of everything flying across the screen).  The game definitely has glitches that will make you table flip and rage quit. I left because I managed to score a winning combo of relics (homing attacks, vampirism, and money increases damage). But then the game crashed and I lost it all. For those of you who have played D3, imagine getting your character with his entire build all set up with the best build, then Blizzard not fixing a crash that takes it all away and you have to do it again. How long will you play that game?  The dev's need to fix these game breaking bugs before continuing to release DLC to milk money from their customers (like me and all the negative reviewers). Now that you know, feel free to buy on sale and blow hours and hours on it. Just realize that at some point, you will hit that frustration wall and just...stop.",

            "review_text": "Hero siege is a 3rd person Rogue-like RPG where you fight different creatures and bosses over a variety of waves. There really isn't much more to say that that. There are a lot of different item drops, and tons of loot(potions and gold) to collect as you kill enemies and explore dungeons. There is a Nice variety of classes in the game, althought I've only played with the viking so far. I'm sure adapting to the other classes will bring further challenge. The game is a lot of fun, and at its sale price of 4.99 I would highly recommend it. I would even recommend it at its 9.99 price tag, I think the game is lots of hack and slash fun going through waves of enemies.   A few complains, but they are minor. I really wish they would have just left the voice acting out. Its absolutely terrible and not needed. I don't mean to insult anyone but the voice acting game is literally the worst I've ever heard. Hearing it at some points kind of takes away from the experience for me. I don't need to hear the viking say 'Damn, now I need to clean my axe' in a very hushed tone with little effort put into it after every boss fight. I could do without that. The other complaint is some items are just so much more valuable than others. Some items can almost guarentee a long run by themselves. I think items being more balanced would bring something more to the game.  There isn't much to say, but I do recommend this game because while the combat is simple, it still feels good and substantial. Pick this up if you're a fan of RPG's or just simple rouglelikes, you'll have a good time for at least a few hours, which is well worth the price tag.  UPDATE: Apparently people are experiencing insta-death moments and game breaking bugs. I have not experienced this but I will keep this in this review to warn you until there is a patch put out that fixes these problems for most people.  Pros: -Fun combat -Loads of enemy types -Fun boss fights, if not a bit easy sometimes -Lots of waves to go through -Plenty of classes -LOOT!  Cons: -Voice acting -Clunky interface -Imbalanced items",

Additionally, half the time the game makes left click (the attack button) the skip wave button at the same time. My finger is nowhere near the space bar, but it will just start skipping waves when i attack anything. It's ridiculous.   Like I said, I want to recommend this game.

Getting a pair of boots at level 24 that I didn't receive a single upgrade for until level 120 or so.  Same with weapon, the best weapon I found until level 109 was a level 35 one.  The screen is absolutely cluttered with effects and you have no idea what will or will not kill you.  Traps and MANY monster effects deal % of your HP in damage, as such there's almost no point in getting HP or damage reduction.  Putting out stat points makes no difference above level 10 or so, because the majority of it will come from temporary effects, and by most, I mean 99% of it.  The end-game feels the same as level 1 through 10. Except if you die in the end-game you might as well restart your character as your temporary items (relics) are wiped.  TL;DR version  The game is an RNGfest with no proper itemization (level 24 items might be better than 100 items of the same quality), and no point in building your character in a specific way.",

The only slightly threatening enemies are random traps you can't see due to weather effects or poison shooting slugs that slow you. Every other enemy sedately walks into you. This game would be challenging to people who have problems fending off the denizens of the local alzheimers home because that's about how fast waves of enemies move and spawn.      Summoned creature AI lags and bugs out in multiplayer. my necromancer had skeletons frequently not follow him and just do whatever they wanted.     Harder difficulties are literally just MORE HP MORE DAMAGE with no apparent changes. Enemy variation is no different, and pack size seems to remain similar to what it was.      Did i mention the item interface? It's the most back asswards thing i have ever seen, with stupid unchangable hotkeys like ' F D and G' for navigating the menus (which are also extremely frustrating in layout). Quick swapping to a new piece of gear in a level is legit impossible because of the 16 steps you need to take to do so which will kill you.

The menu screen has an option for multiplayer and then makes you buy DLC. Multiplayer should be part of the main game, trying to surprise you with required DLC is beyond sleezy. I'd rather have spent a few bucks extra on the main game than to have DLC for an essential part of the game forced down my throat. And many reviews say multiplayer is buggy and doesn't really work anyways.  - there isn't really any balance. I like hard enemies, I like dying as I figure out a challenge. I don't like leveling so I can one shot almost everyone than a random boss/champion/trap appears out of nowhere with an unavoidable attack that squishes me. You keep your character level but have to repeat everything from the very first wave when you die which turns into wading through the early waves of weak enemies over and over again so get back to the boss that one shot you.",

Character classes are mostly same-ey and undifferentiated since you only get 4 active skills and the rest are generally on proc passive skills. You'll struggle and die a lot in the beginning until you randomly happen to get a purple rarity item that literally multiplies all your stats hundredfold, and then since there's no level requirements on items you'll basically never have anything else to put in that equipment slot except for another purple with marginally better stats way down the road. There's literally one artifact that doubles your character's damage. Was breezing through the game until I died and lost it, and now I can't do enough damage to stay alive. Some levels are poorly designed and force you into tight hallways in a game that's all about dodging. Some stuff kills you instantly no matter how much health you have. Certain attacks will stun you long enough to cause everything in the map to converge on you and eat your face. Other times you find yourself breezing through bosses you kill in two hits. DLC basically just makes more levels and more enemies to fight, no new items, character options, or content except new classes to play. Game is often extremely buggy and chugs at times on my gaming desktop.  Kind of fun if you can get a friend to play with, but then you have to go through the trouble of setting up port forwarding to host an online game.  There's plenty of potential for good stuff here, but nothing in the game works the way it's supposed to. Really puts a damper on all of it. As other reviewers have noted, developers focus on putting out new DLC (which adds nothing substantial) rather than fixing the base issues with the game or finding some way to balance it. It's just one huge, hot ugly mess. Basically just a levelling/loot gathering treadmill where the treadmill keeps alternating between 90mph and 0.5mph without telling you what's going on.",

I was enjoying playing as samuri because I bought all DLC that was available at the time. Later on Wrath of Mevius came out and I coughed up my 3$. Now everything was going fine until todays update. Now my samuri build can not be used. Hours of work crashed and burned because I can not use a single skill because of the overwhelming cost. Even the cheapest skill cost a few hundred more points then I have. They are gonna fix this in around a day I thought. But then I saw the 'act 8 under construction' area. You are telling me they are making another DLC? When the already partailly broken game due to new updates, now unplayable because of todays is being ingnored because of a DLC we never asked for? Also when they promised Wrath Of Mevius is the last one. WHAT THE F***??? They took out, attack speed. They took out skill charging/cooldown system and replaced with mana. No one liked mana. Then today they took A HATED SYSTEM AND BROKE IT?? AND THEY DON'T TRY AND EVEN FIX PAST PROBLEMS BUT WORK ON MORE $ GRABBING DLCS WHEN WE ALREADY HAVE 4 FOR A SIMPLE ROUGE-LIKE? I'm sorry. I loved this game. Developers ruined it. Please, may a develper respond to this and address what I said here. That would be highly appriciated and the first step to fixing your currently broken game. EDIT 1:The develpors have realized their mistake, and are currently working on the problems created in the last couple of days.",

READ THIS BEFORE BUYING  If you are buying this game to play multiplayer, don't bother. Not only do you have to pay another $3 to buy the DLC in order to access the online component, but the servers are so awful it doesn't even work once you do.   I saw this game on sale, bought the 4 pack to gift to three other friends and essentially just provided them with a bill.  Why is this even offered in a 4 pack if you're buying a game you can't play with others? At the very least the 4 pack should be complete editions of the game.",

The gameplay is just wave after wave of enemies with a few bosses and dungeon instances thrown in. But every time you do an instance, the entire world regenerates when you come back out. If you wanted to dive into both of those dungeons that have appeared, you're out of luck. Maybe I just got lucky on my third guy, but I played for 3 hours straight and the game was laughably easy. It took less time to get the mini-bosses (which you encounter after every handful of waves and at the end of dungeons) down to 0 HP than it did for the game to do the death animation (they have a drawn out death animation where lightning strikes all over and an angelic choir sings and the boss goes 'AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!' for like 10 seconds).  The gameplay is fun, but it's nothing we haven't seen before. The 'rouge-like' aspect of it is a stretch. You just lose some of your stuff. 'With RPG Elements' means there's XP, Leveling, Skill Points, and an inventory. The inventory is confusing. The control scheme is weird and inconsistent (F is the action button? But sometimes you have to press Enter... Wat?). Um... the good stuff about it is that I sank a bunch of time into it without really feeling it very much (except for the 'too easy' bit).  It seems quite a bit of content is missing from the base game. Evidently, the DLC portions of the game are each worth at least 50% of the base game cost even though it doesn't seem like each adds 50% more game. I haven't purchased them so take that with a grain of salt. There's enough wrong with the base game that it didn't seem worth it to dish out $10 (full price) for DLC (that's more than the game!).  The multiplayer was down and I didn't want to make an account with these people, so I didn't experience that aspect of it. Maybe multiplayer is where the game really shines, but from what I played the game just wasn't compelling enough for me to want to keep giving it my time. For that reason, and because of it's faults, I can't recommend you buy it at full price.  5/10 because I want my roguelikes to kill me. And because it lacks polish where it counts (balance, core game systems, multiplayer servers...).",

Just wait until a Satanic weapon drops directly on top of the exit portal because the boss you're fighting doesn't move. Then you get to stare at it, knowing it's just out of reach. Taunting you.

The game revolves around slaying enemies, receiving xp to level up. And collecting potion and other trinkets to further upgrade your character. Quite simple. So you would think they would make the slaugter of foes to be enjoyable. Considering that the game is about 'kill, collect, repeat'  'NO!'  My one and only issue with this game is the combat. It persist with walking backwards while shooting at the enemy, and accasanoly dodge fire balls or lasers. Thats it.  There are a variety of different classes. most of which are dlcs  But that doesn't change how you play whatsoever. Whether you choose the Pyromancer who shoots fire balls and meteorites. Or the Nomad with a giant (badass) sword and a towel around his head. The game will still persist of walking backwards, and slowly chip away health from the cluster of enemis who walks aimlesly in a straight line towards you  (Bought this game while it was 90% off. and i still asked for a refund)  +Pros +You can buy sweet ♥♥♥ hats and customize your character  +There's full controller support +It has co-op and massively multiplayer +Visualy, it's a very deasent looking game (i'm a sucker for retro looking games)  -Cons -Overall combat.

To begin, I have the DLC so I can't tell if the release has changed the fact that YOU MUST BUY DLC FOR MULTI-PLAYER. If it has that's an awesome improvement, since when I bought the game opened to play it I found myself curious as to where the ♥♥♥♥ the multi-player listed had vanished to. It isn't abandoned yet like a lot of seemingly money hungry indie devs, there is always updates. A lot of people are complaining about difficulty, I found how hard the game was to be refreshing. Sure you can be one shot, you're not supposed to get hit. The problems start with the updates ALWAYS breaking something far worse than the original problem. At first the bugs I was getting in multi-player were things like random CTD's or Random server disconnects. Things like the clicking through the server list would put you into a random server instead of the one you wanted. Useless Skins since they don't show up (you'll see it but others will not) in multi-player, Glad I paid for the collectors edition. Also dungeons and traps were a little misplaced and unreachable for anyone other than the host (It really sucked seeing a trap in one area thinking you're safe and your buddy being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because on his screen you just ran full speed into a trap). Also various Item bugs surrounding relics. My buddy and I decided it was a game worth looking into after some updates. A month later we hopped back in and seen the Server list was fixed and got our hopes up from there. We begin playing and (He's hosting) I'm running around and BAM 'm dead nothing around wave 1. I'm like ok must have been a trap I'm just bad. Happens again and again and my buddy is resurrecting me saying ' Dude wtf why do you keep standing on top of these traps?' Turns out the misplaced traps are now invisible. On to the updated dungeons. Go into the dungeons buddy hits said button to activate said bridge runs across and the bridge never activates for me (tried several different dungeons activation only registers on hosts game client). The skins now don't even show up for you (Extra glad I bought the collectors edition &gt;.&gt;). I think the worst part is that the Dev. actively responds to the community claiming that he has fixed something that is still very much broken or worse. Or that his companies facebook is consistently updated concerning his league of legend rage. Also seeing how much he rages about league of legends and looking at this almost $10 game on my steam really, really pisses me off. Plus I think he has got to be pretty horrible like silver ranking cause it is so much rage.",

It's, in my opinion, a fantastic little gem of a game. Gameplay wise it feels as though the developer stuffed Diablo’s more reserved brother into a blender with The Binding of Issac, and added in a pinch of Killing Floor for good measure. In more sensible terms, it’s got a great number of rogue-like and RPG elements to it. There are a number of different levels, ranging from forests to snowy tundras, deserts and many more. At the end of each of these levels you can collect random pieces of loot, or relics as they’re called, which grant you varying stats and abilities. These relics come in four different flavours; weapon enhancing ones, which, as the name suggests, enhances your weapon giving it extra powers. For example an item called the Basilisk's Tooth makes it so that you have a 2% chance to turn enemies to stone. There are also passive relics as well, which improve your character’s skills. One example is the Cactus, which periodically spawns a cactus on the nearest enemy. The third relic type is active, which, after pressing the use key, will activate the effect of the relic. The Candy Crusher, one example of an active relic, launches candy in a ring around the player that explodes on landing. And the last relic type is orbiting, which float around the player and help during fights. One example is the Almighty Fedora which rapidly shoots projectiles. All these and many more can be obtained by progressing through the game, and surviving the large waves of enemies the game throws at you. Talking about enemies, there are a large number of different types. Ranging from axe throwing skeletons to towering yeti-like beasts. Also there are several “elite” type enemies that have particular skills that happen once they die. For example creating a large laser that spins in a circle or an X shaped explosion, which both appear where the “elite” was slain. There are also a number of RPG elements in the game too. For one, there are unique skill trees for each class, providing varying passive and active abilities, depending on which class you choose out of the possible seven, or ten (depending on whether you own the DLC). They also all have their own sort of personalities and quotes as well. Graphically the game looks a lot like your typical indie, rogue-like affair. But it fits nicely. The characters are easily distinguishable from each other and the varying levels all look pixel pretty with their individual themes and settings.  Overall the game feels enjoyable to play. The classes and their skills vary enough for the game to be replayed time and time again. Not to mention the seemingly endless number of experience levels you can rack up on a single class. The enemies vary in difficultly, depending on the level, and the boss battles, for the most part, feel fairly satisfying once they eventually kick the bucket. To Conclude, I’d say that Hero Siege is worth a play, whether it’s a rogue-like or an RPG you're after, or just a quick bit of fun. It’s a satisfying game to play and well worth a go. Good Day!",

The game itself is fun (especially with friends), but the game has been out for 2 years yet there is a ridiculous amount of crashes, some infuriating bugs, and many server issues. It's uncommon be able to finish the 30 waves per Act in one go without one of my party mermbers or myself crashing (and since there is no hot-join, you will have to exit and remake the game and restart the Act). The bugs I mentioned before are Relic pickup glitches and even sometimes items/relics lost upon reloading (rare but has occured with 2 friends of mine) which is enough to make any gamer rage. The most frustratng was figuring out how to connect with friends online. The dedicated servers and even peer-to-peer are inconsistent for visibility of friends games in the lobby.  TL;DR  The game itself is probably worth it for the $6 price tag, but DO NOT expect a smooth online experience until (if ever) the bugs/crashes have been fixed. If you do choose to gamble on this game, the only reliable solution (from my experience) to connecting with friends is for the host to forward port 5610 and having your friends 'Connect to IP'",

All fond memories to me in different ways.   What i didnt like about this game is the way the developer is a inconsistant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who changes WHOLE classes, UI and stats to be ♥♥♥ backwards...lets it sink in a few months and then CHANGES IT AGAIN. Heres a few examples of flawless game design:   1.) In the previous build of the game there was NO unit collision ( I can walk through any enemy ) to ALL units have collision.   2.) I go to pick up and look at a piece of gear side by side and either press F or G to equip or destroy, like in the old build, and it just picks up the armor?? how the ♥♥♥♥ do i equip it now? how do i throw it away? wheres the update that tells me that this game has been turned on its god DAMN head?  ** Edit ** The developer added in different keys that show you how to either equip or destroy things in your inventory so the world isnt completely over and you can call off the strike. Its still kind of hard to get used to sweeping changes but thats basically all that happens during this games patches. Ill edit in if anything else happens.  3.) Now that you can see how to equip or drop items you have the very real chance to drop an item and while still in the menu pick up the item that you just dropped....but not just one a whole STACK if depending on how much you threw away....and so when you are fiddling around in the menu an enemy comes along and kills you because you have no ability to stop time or see past your characters inventory screen....awesome.  If the dev was looking to model himself after Blizzard North (The dev team for Diablo 2) the thing i wouldnt try to emulate would be buffing the ♥♥♥♥ out of one class or ability and nerfing another to be almost unplayable and not even addressing the issues.  This game definitely has some flaws that need to be worked out but if you have the patience of a saint and just love to wait for ridiculous and glaring issues to be worked out then this is the game for you.",

            "review_text": "Decent game overall with a lot of similarities to Binding of Isaac. Like BOI, it has you progressing from area to area defeating monsters while collecting items and coins and building your stats to eventually take on the boss for that area. It also has a fair amount of replayability as you can attempt to go through the game on harder difficulties to unlock achievements.   Unlike BOI, it lacks style and flair, as well as some sort of story or setting to hold the game together and to provide motivation to progress or some sort of end-goal to work towards. The latter is not necessarily a must-have for these types of games, but I think it certainly could have been an improvement in this case. In addition, the decision to not explain much and let you figure things out as you go along (again, like Isaac) is fine, but it has issues. The key to letting one figure things out is that  one must actually be able to figure things out . In other words, the game doesn't have to hold your hand, but it needs to be intuitive to allow this learning process to happen. Things like referring to the same stat in different ways (mana and energy) will, in general, initially lead to confusion, and gameplay elements such as an empty unexplained chest forever in your inventory (that apparently is only relevant to some unique end-game boss or something) dont mesh well with the decision to let the player figure everything out on their own.  There are a few things that I particularly like about the game. For one, I think I actually prefer the way the combat feels in Hero Siege over Binding of Isaac. The hits you land on enemies just feel a bit meatier and a bit more impactful. FIghting through waves of them can be both satisfying and addicting. It's because of this that I probably don't mind too much the grindy nature of the game (a complaint I often see). It's true that the game could use some rebalancing to avoid the need to revisit and battle through the same areas to build stats and items, but I enjoy the combat enough that it's doesn't feel too much like a chore. Building a beefed-up character, by the way, can also be quite satisfying. The other thing I like about the game is its art. I'm a sucker for well-done pixel art, and the visuals in the game are just that. It's not anything mind-blowing, but it gives the game a very clean and sharp look.  Overall, I like Hero Siege. It's not amazing, but it's fun enough that I'll probably keep playing it for a while to try to get those achievements. If you like Binding of Isaac, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this to some degree.  6/10",

Here's the short version. There's a real review bellow.  Pros  Cool level design. Cool Character design. minidungeons.  Cons. bad hitboxes. VERY grindy. slow progression. boring items. boring abilities.  You level up and get 2 stat points and one ability point. there are 4 stats to choose from; strength, attack speed, armor, health, and putting one point into any of the first three stats will increase it by a fraction. this is fairly useless when enemies have health values in the hundreds, and attack values high enough to be unaffected by a 0.40 increase in your armor. The ability point is really the only thing you will care about when you level up. you can spend the point in a branching ability tree. the first tier of the tree has two options, an active, and a passive, the passives increase chances, or whatever the ability is supposed to affect, by 1 measely percent, so the obvious choice is to choose the active ability, which is pretty interesting to be fair. the downside is that this active ability is all you're going to get until you are level five. this makes the game progress very very slowly.  one of the stranger things about the game considering its inspirations, is that there are very few items to collect. loot comes along once in a great while, and your first item is likely to be uninteresting. upon beating the first boss an item spawned on a pedestal in front of the portal, it was a green double crescent blade and ot gave me a SLIGHT increase to my crit chance. the boss itself dropped a token for me that gave me a stat tradeoff attack +4 armor -2. both of these were terribly dissapointing. I killed a drake type boss, and as such i expected an item to reflect that, perhaps an item that had to do with shooting a fireball or having enemies burn the ground on death, but all i got was a change to my numbers.   probably the hardest part of the game to swallow was the awful hitbox detection. i spent a long time getting used to simply hitting enemies. everything is a 2d sprite in sort of an isometric view, which makes it inherently more difficult to judge differences between distances. This can be a nightmare when fighting spiders, which have a large sprite, but a tiny hitbox. and certain classes are particularly bad at hitting enemies, in this case namely the pirate has a hard time because her pistol shots alternate between her left and right hand, which occupy different planes which makes it more than likely you will miss half of your shots unless you're very very used to her. Melee characters are also terrible because their attack animations extend beyond their hitboxes. Compare this with the binding of isaac, it has the same 2d models and the same view, but its fairly clear where you're firing and all that good stuff.  In conclusion, play either diablo or play binding of isaac. This game wants to be both, but it doesn't do either very well. If you see the game on sale, go ahead and buy it, just know that it isnt a tight and clean experience.  ",

I sunk 5 hours into my Marksman, and experienced my first freeze, had to close via Task Manager and lost everything. There's no autosave, so if you enter through a portal to the next level, you'd best hope you don't have a horde waiting for you, and have to pop all your cooldowns, because odds are, one of those times, you're going to crash. It has happened twice now, the other being after the annoyance at losing my stuff, only to see it happen again, this time as a fatal coding error.  But, you know, for $2, it's a good time consumer.

There are rogue-like elments, as the blurb mentions, but they're incorporated well. You spin around nuking monsters collecting your loot, then you can upgrade certain aspects on the fly. Your fire rate, your speed, things like that. When you die, you lose the buffs you've unlocked. Gather xp though, you can unlock skills which stick with you after death. The two of these combined are just enough carrot to keep you pressing on, especially as your toon becomes fully powered and you start to lay waste in more and more powerful fashion.   My favorite part of Hero Siege is that at heart, it's truly casual. Despite roguelike elements, the game is perfect for playing in small chunks when you only have a few minutes to spare. Plus, if you set it down and get wrapped up in some new shiny AAA title, the game is super simple to pick back up again days or even months down the line.

            "review_text": "Overall, the game needs extreme balancing and polishing.   As far as the pros go, it's relatively fun to run around killing monsters. However, nothing really feels particularly remarkable or original. Things start off incredibly slow and you'll soon find yourself more annoyed by the traps, monsters, and game in general than immersed in it.  The classes feel astoundingly unbalanced. And although you have several (not a huge amount) of passive and active skills to dump your talent points into, many feel severely underwhelming or just make no sense, such as the necromancer's talent to buff all summons improving each summon more than the individual summon talents themselves.   You also have the choice of dumping points into Strength, Swiftness, Armor and Stamina, though you'll soon find there's no point in anything but Stamina to avoid being instagibbed. That said, you'll still get instagibbed after hundreds of waves, most likely by a trap which can be astoundinly overpowered. The majority of your character progression is through relics which you have a chance of grabbing after bosses, from chests or short dungeons and you can stack up a large amount to run through enemies, but they're easily lost as you only have them for that particular run and getting instagibbed is easy which leaves you to start off terribly slowly.  With regards to relics, some have terribly useless descriptions and there's no way I've found to even look at the description after you've picked them up. Other items that are permanantly worn are picked up on a 'discard or replace and discard worn item' basis, with the discarded items simply disappearing. That said, the game doesn't pause when you're picking up items, which has caused me to lose a significant upgrade when being attacked by a monster when picking up an item and having to immediately cancel and discard the item. Traps also still remain after an area is cleared which can just make checking the loot a pain when things are still shooting at you.  Many of the sprites also appear rather half-♥♥♥♥♥ as well as things like 'puzzles' in dungeons which generally consist of walking around stepping on buttons or pulling levers and feel like a complete waste of time.  Also seeing a class in the opening video you'd like to play then buying the game and realizing you have to buy DLC for it is kinda bogus.  You can have fun with this game, it's just not worth it.",

For a relatively cheap game it is very woth your while to purchase. I played it with some buddies for multiple hours now and for the cost i got some amazing enjoyment out of it. This game actually has some longevity to it compared to other cheap games and that is great. It is great fun with friends however it does fall flat playing solo.  That being said it does have numerous bugs that will crash your game (like talking to the landlord but i think that has been patched,) The town is shallow, and you cant really purchase things outside of levels with your hard earned goals, also there is nothing purchasable that wont disappear upon death. And the DLC is grossly overpriced for what you get.  But despite the negatives the game looks amazing, the short cutscenes after bossfights ACTUALLY INCLUDE YOUR (key word is YOUR) CHARACTER(S) opposed to other games which will use filler characters in the clips (which by the way are really well designed)  Quick things to list: -Decent graphics outside of clips -Wont break weaker computers -Every character feels unique in both abilities and design -Game feels too easy on first playthrough (probably intentional) however becomes basically impossible on next difficulty up -Wave trigger is broken and you can spam it and skip to the last wave, also skips to last wave randomly  Overall: Great game to pick up on sale if you have friends to play with, I fell in love with it, However not worth your while solo, DLC not worth it unless on sale  7/10 - Dat Boi ",

Hero Siege is an excellent time-killer. Twin-stick, randomly-generated, Roguelike gameplay with 5+ classes, customization, dozens of special items to find in dungeons for extra power... It scatches so many game itches for those of us who enjoy some action RPG (light RPG, mind you) fun. The basis of the game is fighting off wave after wave of enemies, leveling up as you do so and obtaining items of power (relics) on a periodic basis. This game screams for a gamepad; you move in eight directions and shoot in four independent directions, while also activating items, allocating stats at level and buying from shops. I don't want to imagine doing that on a keyboard.  Like a true Roguelike, there's no telling what you'll get with each area. Maps are generated randomly; you might be under constant assault by traps (which you can lure monsters into), have a maze of trees to navigare through, find a bounty of loot chests, or all sorts of other scenarios. There are over 100 relics right now to find in the game, and each provides either a significant stat boost or a special ability to your character. It's complete luck of the draw what you get, and the developers were gutsy enough to put in some truly unbalanced items, such as relics that give you the ability to fly over open air and water, staying completely out of the range of many enemies. No game played is a waste; if you die, you'll lose all the relics you've collected, but can restart with all the levels your character has amassed (except in the perma-death Hardcore mode.)  Miniboss and legendary versions of regular enemies show up on a regular basis and every sixth wave, you'll fight a boss creature; success takes you to a new area (and often rewards you with a relic.) There are four 'Acts' to the game, with apparently more to come, and 5 classes to try out and level up, also apparently with more to come. The game supports some sort of local multiplayer right now, but I have only done single-player mode. I can imagine that getting 2-4 people going on the same game would be a hilarious blast.  The bottom line is that there's a lot of variety in this little title. The repetitve wipe-em-out nature of the game might not be for everyone, but I've already put in 12+ hours on a single class type, and that's more 'fun' time than I've gotten out of many AAA titles at three times the price or more.",

            "review_text": "Gotta say the fact that something as essential (Essential for this kind of game anyway) as MULTIPLAYER is a payed for DLC is utter nonsense.  I repeat! You Have to BUY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER as a seperate DLC. I see now why 'Multiplayer' isn't included in the tags.  Now, on to my (admitttedly limited) experience with the game: It was okay I guess. Nothing really grabbed my attention. The graphics were nice enough, the controls worked, the enemies kind of wandered towards me as I kited them all to death with little trouble at all. I found that my abilities had trouble acitvating however. Many times I'd press the button (even 2 or 3 times) and nothing would happen. The ability icon would be in full colour, but it just wouldn't activate.  Eventually I reached the first boss and that's where this games shortcomings really brought themselves out. The boss was this armless zombie who spawned swarms of flies and threw giant spike balls. Sounds interesting in concept, but the execution was rather poorly done.   1) The swarms of flies are constantly moving towards me which results in a constant wall between me and the boss and he always spawns more as soon as I clear a swarm.  2) The flies each have a noticable amount of health. They are not as easy to clear as you'd think flies would be.  3) Every time he attacked, And I do mean EVERY TIME he attacked, the boss would speak one of his 3-4 sayings. And with his neverending wall of flies you can imagine that those lines would get repetitive.  4) Eventually the flies started spawning with elemental enhancements which didn't seem like a problem at first, until one fly touched me and I was frozen and then instagibbed by the swarms.  5) I levelled up like, 7-10 times just on those flies alone, in like, a few minutes. To me there's something wrong with a boss fight if the minions He's spawning are strong enough to warrant that much of a reward.  TLDR: 1) Visuals and music are nice  2) Controls work for the most part  3) You have to BUY ONLINE MULTIPLAYER  4) Bosses can be frustrating to fight  5) Character sayings get annoying  6) Can't shoot diagonally  7) Get's pretty old really fast",

First, addressing all the Non-recommended reviews: The community is small but pleasant most of the time, and the developers are working and responding to how the community wants to shape the game.Yes they try new things, and yes they mess it up sometimes. But if the community doesn't like it then it gets revoked and they take a step back. Mana System is not bad at all despite what people make it out to be. There are bugs that people happen to lose their relics and then come write a negative review instead of troubleshoot the problem with developers. You should also note the date of most of the (Helpful Reviews) are from more than two months ago (with exception).  The game itself (As of February 5th 2016) PROS ------------------- - Latest update has smoothed gameplay a lot - If you are in the U.S. they just added dedicated servers so multiplayer is a lot more playable with other people. (Other dedicated servers are in Germany, sorry Asia dwellers) - Community is small and you'll make friends fast - Gameplay is pretty fun, loot system lets you pick up gear and there is a decent (albiet small and not too variable) skill system. - Wave System allows you to control what comes at you, enemies are now released in packs that speed up gameplay. - Endless Level Wormhole lets you put your gear to the test with enemies that scale up a lot. CONS ---------------------- - Siege Mode doesn't let you skip waves at the moment. - There is a relic that when you pick it up and exit game, causes all your relics to disappear. - Sometimes devs try something out that everybody hates and you have to wait a while for them to revert the changes. - Sometimes crashes unexpectedly, annoying but boots right back up quickly, doesn't have any extremely negative results from the crash (loss of items, gold, etc.) from what I've seen so far. - Active Relics (kind of like skills you have to activate) are way less powerful than Passive ones.  I'll update with more as the game progresses, but it is very much playable in it's current state and quite fun despite what others think. If you got more than a full day in game time, I'd say you have gotten your money's worth.",

Unfortunately, the developer(s?) have no idea how to playtest their game, apparently, as I consistently get bugs and unreasonably high RAM usage from it. Issues I never had originally. So they broke the game with updates and I have yet to play a session where I do not get bumped out for 'Fatal Memory Error.' Pretty disappointing, as the game was a lot of fun initially, even for quite a long time.

Thank goodness one developer can think for themselves and aren't just aping the thing umpteen others latched onto. I also liked the character designs and the customisations that you could put on them. The visual style is an appealing one, and the audio is also really great. The gameplay, however...when others have mentioned it's frustrating, they're not kidding. And it's not the kind of frustrating that really keeps you coming back, it's just annoying and, after a point, boring. The game boasts random, different levels, but I just got the same exact level over and over again, with no differences that I could detect. The bosses are cheap in a boring way, the experience is just...boring. It's boring and frustrating, which are two things that I don't look for in games.  Maybe if I enjoyed this genre more, I'd really be into this one, but it doesn't make any impression but a bad one with me. I didn't want it to hold my hand, but it not only didn't hold my hand, it tossed me in with no explanations as to anything. While that can be fine for some, a lack of explanation on essential features like skills and powers really is inexcusable; all you have is an icon, which doesn't really illustrate what it's for. So setting skills is hit or miss...mostly miss, because you don't really know what's going to be useful.  And speaking of hits, the hit detection in this game is really questionable. Oh, something's in your general vicinity! I guess it does damage to you. Oh wait, there's something random that appeared from nowhere! Guess you're dead, time to start the whole level over again. Oh, fun. I adore retreading well-tread paths. Especially when I've done it a dozen times before. But it doesn't really even make encounters exciting or fun, just irritating because you do not, in any way, have the ability to take on any and every foe, but of course they have the capability of steamrolling you, or at least whittling you down until you're so bored you either make a crucial error or just quit the game altogether.  There's also attempts at 'bullet hell' type scenarios, which only artificially ramp up the game's difficulty, usually in an annoying way, and it doesn't really mesh well with the rest of the game. The whole experience seems to be a 'trying too hard' one desperately tossing in artificial ways of ramping up difficulty without actual thought given to how to make the game more fun and enjoyable. Because it's not. It's the opposite of fun.   If you're into the dual-stick shooter type games, check it out. Maybe you'll enjoy it. But honestly I can't really recommend this to anyone. I paid basically $1 for it and I still regret it. This is just not a good or enjoyable game, and I can't see myself really ever coming back to it.",

I know it's a problem with my internet, even though my internet is fine, I really wish Hero Siege would host their own servers for people to play on so other players don't have to worry about lag like that.   I'm not sure if there will be a feature in the future to prevent players for being forced to port forward, but I sure hope they think about adding it, because it's frustrating when my friends can't see any of the npc's due to lag.   EDIT: I just read the recent hero siege update, and apparently they have a beta for a dedicated server in germany, and apparently they are planning to make one soon for the US too, so hopefully when they come out it'll fix all the lag issues for multiplayer!

The dedicated servers simply do not work for any of my friends and do not give an error message. You have to do the port forwarding direct games for now.   There is a ton of bugs. From items not working right to stuff being invisible to the 'remember username' box not actually saving the user name etc. Several friends died to fire towers or poison goo that is simply not visible. There are a few puzzles requiring you to stack pillars on certain squares. I can't see what my friends are doing and if they finish it the barrier doesn't drop for me meaning I have to do the same puzzle.  Relics are kind of similar to binding of issac and are a great addition... when they actually work. Nothing was more fun then getting about 5 rows of them and logging out just to realize all that work getting ready for the boss was now gone. Friend got a relic that boosted strength by a huge margin at the cost of lowering all his other stats. He died and lost the relic but kept -75 to his other stats. Even spending a stat reset didn't totally fix the issue.  For a game that is 'finished' and adding DLC there is so little polish. Bugs are at the least crippling and at the worst flat out game breaking. 90% of my crashes have been on log in, character select, or creating a game so at least its rare to crash mid game.  Game doesn't feel tuned at all either. Some classes have abilities that are useless and have mana cost that are so incredibly high that you can't cast them leveled so you have to keep the level lower to be able to use it at least once and MAYBE twice depending on the skill. Bosses at early game have like 7k - 30k life. Bosses at late game also have like 7-30k life. Then end act bosses shoot up to nearly 750k+. Trash shouldnt be walking aroud with 3-5x the area bosses health.  If you pick it up for under a dollar youll get at least 10 hours out of it but once you look at how mandatory the dlc is and add in the fact that multiplayer is a mess it starts to get more hazy. If they patch the game with bug fixes and some balance tweaks it would be a ton better.",

Buy it for local coop with controllers  Simple on the surface, but has endless amounts of carnage to dish out in co-op or single player. The classes are highly unbalanced but that is a good thing, it lets you choose how difficult the game is by trying out different classes of which there are plenty and finding the best match for your playstyle. For quick progression i suggest pyromancer, archer, or necromancer because you can set up turrets and summons for each of the classes and just focus on staying alive. Pump HP into pyromancer once you powerlevel them to atleast summon a flame turret. THe melee classes to me are difficuilt to survive long with but higher levels may make it more bearable.   Has elements of an open world type binding of issac mixed with realm of the madgod with heavy influences from issac, but with less meaningful powerups that you can hardly see a difference when picking up, but there are quite a few that will change the odds to your favor quickly. Just like the pills in Binding of issac, you can drink potions for random effects. The random generation is nice too and i prefer it on steam rather than mobile devices, unless you can afford a controller that works with ipad etc.  Don't buy the DLC immediately until you decide that you want bonus stages, becasue it can be difficult to get that far , and first see if the game will keep you hooked for that long.

They got it spot on with the stats, level design, random events, bosses, and items  The only two drawbacks i'd see is that It's still a bit buggy, monsters get stuck in the environment is the main thing i've seen and the animation of picking up relics. Relics basically empower your character in the same way as in binding of isaac, however, picking up a relic freezes you on the spot for a few seconds, whilst being prone to attack from the mobs of monsters... it makes me wonder why the devs put that in.   Apart from that, great game!!",

            "review_text": "Hero Siege is a pure grind for skills and upgrades RPG with rogue like randomness. You play on a battlefield that is about 12 times larger than the screen, each time the locations of elements are randomized and there are a few things you can count on but the rest is randomized. Ever now and again you will find a dungeon or keep which forces the camera closer to your character giving you linear levels with puzzles and boss battles to break up the monotany, these can vary greatly in difficulty, but always worth the risk unless you get those rare super difficult ones.  This game is addicting and well thought out, but there are problems. The randomness lends itself to you dying for very stupid reasons, like triggering a laser blast that drains your health in a few ticks of the game time while against a tree or simply grabbing a potion at the wrong time. No game is perfect, but this game is a little more varied than I am used to and comes with a few bugs that don't break the game, but should be very easy for the developer to fix.  - Clothing options don't actually show the characters you have assigned to the slots - Clothing options reset every time you use them - Some stats don't add up correctly when you have multiple items (vague but it seems to happen ever few games) - Sometimes it seems like if you have a skill that fires 5% of the time, it will fire 5 times in a row for every 100 shots... weird.  Some of the characters are kind of broken when compared to the others like the viking and the necromancer.  The Viking's skills are geared towards charging enemies, but running at them might be a death sentence. Some bosses are near impossible to beat with the viking as he has no long range attacks. Giving him regeneration or the ability to redirect damage would fix him in some respect, but right now, he is about the worst character.  The Necromancer's minions fall off the screen often... always when you don't need it. Almost impossible for the necromancer to beat some dungeons because of this.  The rest of the characters are fine, but those two need the help of a coop partner, which brings this game up several notches in enjoyment.  There are problems, but this is a great game to just have fun with someone else and grind. The fun is finite, but for $6 it is worth it. Grab a friend and two controllers and start slaying monsters in mass. You can amp your characters to the point you are destroying everything on the screen with little effort, but the curveballs this game throws at you always keep you on your toes.

In my first play session i already played 2 hours. I have played some gaming sessions longer but this is my very first. So right of the bat the addictive nature of this game is very high. The mutiple characters keep the game fresh and i can't wait to play other characters. Each different character has it's pros and cons like between melee and ranged characters. As a ranged character you obviously have the ranged advantaged on melee enemies but deal little damage. While melee characters deal lots of damage they are close to the very dangerous enemies. Right now the only gripe I have is the multiplayer. The multiplayer came out on July 18 and the day i put out this review is July 18 so is going to have lots of problems. Only to name a few problems like the game crashing when started a game and when you are revived you are still dead but in other player's eyes you are alive. But then again it is in EARLY access alpha, so the bugs will most likley be squashed because the my friends has the game and we only really had one match that we could accutly play in, but that only lasted a minute before we died. Also another gripe I have is for multiplayer is to host a server you HAVE to port foward, and that took some time. But right now the single player is more than enough for me.   My Final Verdict: Right now it is on sale so pick it now, even if it is not on sale pick it up if you want a fun time waster, but if you came for a multiplayer experience than wait until most bugs have been squashed and hopfully they have legit servers that don't require port fowarding. I did make this review seem very negitive but that is only on a single asspect while there is still and entire game for me to tell you about. I don't have that much time to type anymore so i will just say the entire game is very well crafted (except for the early access alpha multiplayer). So don't be scared of the multiplayer the single player is amazing!",

You blast and dodge your way through many levels and waves of enemies and collect interesting loot along the way that makes you more powerful. Tons of fun to play!  I would recommend this game if you enjoy some arcade hack-'n'-slash gameplay. It certainly isn't lacking in that department.  It is, however, lacking in the multiplayer department. The multiplayer for Hero Siege has a lot of instabilities, and is definitely still in an alpha stage. If you're getting this game to play with friends, bring them to your house and play local. Otherwise, you're going to have a hell of a time with inexplicable connectivity issues and other problems.  If you want a fun arcade-style game to play with friends together locally though, Hero Siege is definitely the right pick, I only hope they get more functionality added in soon.",

I loved cod zombies but there was a massive sense of 'everything i've done is ruined' at the end that it was hard to go back to play a game straight after. With hero siege even if you die stupidly the xp you've earned and the stats you have allocated remain intact so each time you play the first level it gets easier and easier but reaching the harder levels is still a challenge. I also could see myself playing this game through several times. with 8 (i think) different types of character you can be, you'll want to upgrade all of them so when the online game comes out you're ready for anything 10/10",

At first they throw A LOT of different enemies at you, but later on they just leave first ones out and at about 100 wave point the last 50 waves felt like a grind.  Same thing with dungeons/lairs, there seem to be only couple of layouts of them and later on you find yourself exploring same area you've explored at the first ten waves.  Arenas themselves feel good. They're big enough, but not too big. There are enough enviromental hazards you can use as your advantage against your foes.   Still, IF you enjoy these kinds of games you WILL enjoy Hero Siege. Interface is little bit 'Mobile-y' and clunky but it doesn't really matter.",

It is so hard that I wasn't able to pass the first world of 4 total (and on 'normal' difficulty!), but the more you die, the more levels you gain, the easier it gets.  Sadly there were some things I didn't like: you can only move and shoot on 4 directions; it gets repetitive after a while; there are no options to customize the game; my save game got corrupted and in the middle of one gameplay it slowed down to half speed without any reasons.

Why, you ask? This game is a clear wink to people who have played Diablo II, Diablo III, The Binding of Isaac and/or Realm of the Mad God. It is some kind of cocktail, a damn delicious one.  Unfortunately, even though this game brings me back my childhood nostalgia feels of spending countless hours on Diablo II, it needs polishing, and a lot of it. It seems my friends tend to have game crashes fairly often, followed by countless minor bugs (sure, they're minor, but there are a lot of them.) In fact, the official bugtracker page had over 5 pages of public bugs last time I checked.   I understand you're a 3-man team, but please, FOCUS on polishing this game rather than developing your new one (Eastfound). FOCUS on fixing the countless bugs people have posted and whined about, rather than developing an Android/iOS mini version of the game.  As much as I'd like to hate on this title, it's given me a fair good amount of nostalgia satisfaction and *if* the developers start thinking straight it has AMAZING potential. That's why I would still recommend it to anyone, although I did obtain it during the sale for less than a dollar, and could understand people being angry for a buggy version @ full price.",

            "review_text": "Hero Siege is a good game and I think there are some good elements in its style and play but I am only *just* giving it a thumbs up and you'll see why later.  To begin with it seems fairly straight forward and the controls are extremely similar to those in 'The Binding Of Isaac'. You go around, you kill stuff and you die. A lot.A whole damn lot. It is a nice challenge to begin with and when you win you feel like a boss. When you lose, you lose everything except your experience/level. This gets frustrating and the fact that when you open the shop the game doesn't pause just adds to my 'Rage-o-meter of screw you game'. Despite these annoying flaws the key gameplay remains acceptable.  I quite enjoy the occasional spawning of mini-boss monsters and it adds a nice touch that traps are littered around for you to kill enemies with. One problem though. These traps can just as easily kill you and when they hit you, it hurts. It REAAAALLLY hurts! This is incredibly annoying and has resulted in me beating many a boss just to have a flying spiky testicle of doom shoved in my face. Annoying really.  The bosses are varied but most are really too easy to begin with. When you beat the boss (and don't get 'testicled' to death) you can gain a power up or item, much like in 'The Binding of Isaac'. These range from overpowered hamburgers to davinci style missile shooters. Some are excellent ideas with a cool graphic style. Some are absolute ♥♥♥♥.  The classes are rather badly composed with four currently available and the only ones that are any good are those that have ranged attacks. The other ones are useless because nearly ALL the enemies have ranged attacks and more than one of the bosses can nigh insta-kill you with his attacks which are close range whereas with a ranged character you can sit-back, get popcorn and smash the boss' face in.  Despite all this I really enjoy playing this game but only in short bursts. It can be an incredibly fun game with okay music and good gameplay mechanics but if you rage easily or didn't like 'The Binding of Isaac' it really isn't worth your time.  Music - 6/10 Graphics - 8.5/10 Gameplay - 7/10 Difficulty - goes from 2/10 to 9/10 Replay Value - 8/10  OVERALL - About 6.5/10",

Im giving it a re review cause the game has changed a lot since i last played it and my review requires an update too. They have added new characters requiring payments and have given a couple of new characters for free (they were also payed for before).   Furthermore there is now this sort of 'hub' place at the begining now were all the levels are placed out as well as some confusing people that are placed in this hub/village. Each one is a different thing, shop, portal places and random things. Thankfully the leveling system, skills and abilities have all stayed the same.   Honestly this is how this game is thats why my review feels all over the place, this is how u feel playing the game. I cant reamember how much i payed (got it off sale for sure) but this game feels like a free to play with the ammount of cash related feautures that are in this game, crystals (extra cash related money), skins and extra characters (havent checked if multiplayer is still pay to play).   With all this it rather difficult to give this game a good rating. So much has changed yet i still feel that they think they are making a free game. It also gives it away as this game is nearly always on sale, its that bad that they know it.",

It is roguelike of course but not perma-death. You keep your level, stats and skill points, just have to start from the beginning of the level. Which is what makes me think this is a grindy game.

Most notably, a bug where the game freezes for about 3 seconds at the end of almost every wave. If you try to move during the freeze, it will sometimes take you off the map. It will also get you killed if there is anything attacking or shooting at you before or during the freeze.

My point is this game is worth the buy. there are a bunch of really fun characters to play, lots of fun RNG and skill based runs, and constant dev support from people who care about customer satisfaction. Buy the game, Buy the DLC and have your friends buy it too. its a great game.   PS: the online multiplayer is functional but not great yet, but the local multiplayer is a blast.

Speaking of audio, I'm pretty sure they nicked some voice clips from DotA.  Combat is okay as far as hack and slay goes - sort of repetitive but skill is involved - but the graphical mess is a problem. The balancing has gotten much better since I bought it, but it's still odd. Upgrades used to be irrelevant, but they fixed it and now there's actual progression. The random level generation isn't worth mentioning, since most of the game happens in wide open areas outside.

I thought at first the game was something more along the lines of a quest-completion kind of game. Where you go to certain areas and fight off certain monsters. But no, this game allows you do (kinda) whatever you want! You can go to any world you want to (after beating the previous one, of course) and it ALWAYS has a purpose! Like going to world 1 on normal mode just to get a couple relics/gold/xp!   I really think this game has amazing elements and in truly deserving of a 10/10 from me. It's a game that can't be missed! C ya later! ^-^",

Voice acting is meh and thankfully there's an option to turn it off. Character customization is also a bit lack luster. I'd like to see more than just hats. The game also forces you to register to somewhere outside of steam which is frustrating as well. Current gameplay is fun though, and besides voice acting the sound assets are quite enjoyable.

Melee classes aren't very good in this game, and I recommend you select a ranged class (at least in the beginning). When I was playing as a Viking, the game was so difficult and repetitive (apparently) that I thought I would never have fun with this. After a while, I decided trying another class (I picked up a Necromancer).  Ranged classes are way better, believe me. With the necromancer, I now have a lot of fun playing this. There are dungeons (and they are not easy), bosses, puzzles and rare and random items(potions with different effects, weapons..). Getting to another level is hard, but it's very satisfacting when you finally get there.   Well, if you like rogue-like games, grinding/farming and challenging games, you should buy Hero Siege. If you think grinding is boring, you shouldn't. It's kinda repetitive after sometime, but it's pretty fun.   6/10",

Pros: Extremely Rewarding/Satisfying Gameplay TONS of Replayability Challenging Difficulty Wide Character-Customization 2-Player Same Screen  Cons: Repetitive Music Character Movement - At times, especially when completing  quests, character movement may feel slow in contrast to the size of the map. These can be fixed by drinking potions though. Multiplayer Servers - Multiplayer is in Beta, so don't judge heavily on this analysis. Sometimes the servers can go down.  Interface: Simple, In-Game however is a bit tricky to understand, but nothing too hard to grasp. Graphics: Old school 2D 8-bit. Theme: Dark cult, 'Binding of Isaac'-like. Music: Soundtrack goes very well with the theme of the game however at times may seem quite repetitive. Difficulty: Hard, yet very rewarding. Gameplay: A LOT OF FUN, hours of replayability, wide arsenal of characters, every playthrough is different than the last. DLC: The DLC is excellent, however you do not need it to play the game, as it is not a free-to-play.   -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  I picked up this game while it was on sale and thought I'd give it a try. By far one of the best and most addicting games I've played in a while. This game has similar concepts as 'The Binding of Isaac' in which you pick up 'Relics' (Power-Ups) to alter the game, some better than others. The skills each character has really represents their style, no 2 characters are similar. Speaking of characters, you can customize them with all sorts of reminiscent features from other more bigger-title games, from Twisted Metal, to Halo, to Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance, and many other titles.  Hero Siege handles gold as a currency however it features a special type that allows you to purchase customizable features. You don't have to worry about spending any real money to acquire 'Crystals' though. Once you buy the game there isn't any more money you have to spend to unlock anything, asides DLC. The crystals are harder and slower to acquire, thus adding to the grind-like game. But the rate in which you get these seems just right, you are rewarded every time you do something big like clear a dungeon or defeat a boss.  In conclusion I absolutely love this game and recommend it to anyone who enjoys: Diablo 3 The Binding of Isaac Realm of the Mad God Rogue Legacy  You will find that this game, although having similar traits to the games listed above, stands out on its own.",

But, once you overcome the restlessness that comes along with starting a new game and find yourself settled with the game, prepare to become fully infatutated with Hero Siege. Hero Siege has a lot of great points, as well as bad, which you can easily find out either by reading reviews on the game or buying it and finding out wether you dislike/like the game there. Don't let the reviews sway your mind to only take one look at the game and either buy or ignore the game. See for yourself thoroughly, wether or not you want the game, because Hero Siege isn't your average game.  As I said before, Hero Siege has its good and bad points, the things that determine its quality. Some good things about Hero Siege is that it twists RPG elements in a good way. For example, normally in quests for RPGs, you'd have to travel through multiple environments, defeat a couple of enemies, or retrieve something important to the quest giver in order to receive a reward that you already knew you'd get (for the most part). But, in Hero Siege, you'll never know what you'll get. Maybe some new armour, maybe a buttload of coins. (I find the mystery in that enticing.) Your reward varies, wether or not you did something difficult. Adding on to this, a lot of quests in RPGs have you running around and traversing multiple stages/environments, which again, is different from Hero Siege, where your quest and everything needed to fulfill it is right on one screen from your quest-giver to your objective(s) in the quest.  As I said before, though, Hero Siege also has bad things about it. For example, it's hard to get into at the start, as I said before. Trying to play with friends is a pain, and if you run on a toaster and find out that the game only allows the FPS to go up to 60, you'd die by the pain that is lag. As well as the fact of all the bugs that involve relics and the stages that can knock you into a gate that you will never be able to leave.  But y'know, Hero Siege is a perfectly good hack 'n slash in my opinion, though I have almost no experience with games like these outside of the game itself. Besides, all these reasons that represent Hero Siege's 'quality' doesn't really matter all that much because it doesn't matter wether in some peoples' eyes it's a good game or not. What you think of the game is what matters. I recommend this game because that shows what I think of Hero Siege.",

You can just roll over the levels, go right to the boss (skipping waves / fighting all of them at the same time) and change difficulty. The upper bosses are harder, but you will encounter only after a looong phase of easiness. I'm not saying it's not fun ;) It's kinda Kreygasmic to hardstomp your enemies like this, but some people will not like it.  2nd bad point : The devs don't really care about the game. Though there are many updates (like 3 in 2 days xD), the multiplayer system is bugged since 2014 (you can read community's angriness if you search a little).

Ingredients: 1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter 2. 1/2 cup white sugar 3. 1/2 cup brown sugar 4. 1/4 cup water 5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon 6. 1 pinch salt 7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced 8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie   Directions: 1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicing.",

As for Hero Siege, I would call it 'wasted potential once again'. It could and should be much, much better. If you got it on a sale ('Damn you, Steam sales! You always take my money!'), it's OK.

I initially bought it when it was on sale over at  Humblebundle.com  for something like a dollar or two. I thought, 'hey this will be a good hour or so' then 5 hours later I realised that this game had me hooked. Once the DLC for Act V and the Samurai came out I happily paid the $6 for it. This game is well worth that and even more.  The art style is charming and I've found that I really enjoy the asthetic of the monsters, player models, and all the effects. The UI leaves something to be desired though. These guys are constantly updating things and they listen to player feedback. Although, they can get a bit defensive at times. There are a few issues which make it a little bit frustrating at times. For instance if you view a relic that you don't want inbetween waves you have to push B (or the keyboard equivalant) to discard it. This will automatically trigger the next wave since the discard relic and start next wave buttons are one in the same. The reason this is annoying is because if there was a dungeon or crypt that you wanted to visit between waves, well, that's closed until the next wave now. All-in-all this is only a minor concern.  The game is completely addictive. Each run is over once you die but you level you character and become more powerful and your next run is even better than the last. As with many games with rouge-lite elements you will amass items in order to make your toon more powerful over the course of the run. This is reminiscent of The Binding of Issac. One run might not be very powerful and you might die early on, and the next run you'll be a god smashing through hoards of mobs with righteous vengeance! The addtion of online co-op and the inclusion of local co-op just enhance this experience. However, a word of caution; the MP aspect of the game is currently in a buggy state. While the devs are constantly working to fix it, it would seem that they are having a bit of trouble in that department. None-the-less, I still highly recommend this game.",

(Dont buy this unless you have more then the recommended setting. I got all the recommended requirement met exept for the ram witch is on minimum.

Because you won't be abble to go further without doing so.)  Yes some of the good point just went straight down to void. Why... I can't answer properly since I did'nt made the game and were badly incorporated in the game.   I had fun with it for a while in the past after passing the 10 first level. Even with bug making me enable to see traps it was passable, on mutliplayer(it got fixed. YAY! the latence makes it none the less useless.. Aw!)  I hope to that they can make it better in the future. Probly will.  But, as of now. No its not fun. I have more fun playing solitaire with cards that I have to shuffle...",

The only way to actually get a multiplayer game going is to use the peer-to-peer option and use hamachi, tunngle, or something similar.  Other than multiplayer issue I give this game 10/10",

            "review_text": "Hero Siege is kinda like those WC3 Hero Defense custom maps back in the day--it's just about running around grinding waves of enemies until you hit a boss. This game is pretty much a portmanteau of Diablo 3 and Binding of Isaac gameplay.  This game is really addicting and has the potential to be great, but there are a few glaring issues holding it back.  The first--going back to where I said it's like Diablo 3, this game has an unhealthy obsession with Blizzard crap. Expect to encounter Diablo/Warcraft references (including Acolyte quotes and a Frostmourne item) which are amusing at first but become tiresome quickly.  The second is the Diablo 3-like difficulty scaling. The game rips off their elite/boss system in which dead bosses sometimes shoot stuff at you after they're dead. One of these is a giant spinning laser which is obviously taken straight from D3. My main contention is not that the ripoffs ruin the game, but that it introduces the same problem that D3 had--you can go multiple levels without taking too much damage, and then you get a spinning laser put right on top of you in a hallway, or some super-damaging projectile hidden amongst the hundreds of other projectiles littering the screen and die immediately, sometimes without knowing what caused it (and allocating your stats defensively does not mitigate this at all). In this way the game is unbalanced because the game will be a walk in the park for 30 minutes straight and then have a massive difficulty spike for a few seconds which kills you because your reactions are only human.  The third is the stat system. Str and Dex (or was is Speed? whatever the equivalent was) are completely useless and only increase the stats by the smallest possible fraction. As a result, builds that rely on attack speed or attack damage are useless, and subsequently, so are 50% of the items in the game that increase these stats. Thus the success of a character build invariably falls on 'whose flat-damage abilities scale the best?' (Hint: it's probably Pyromancer.)   So, those are the main issues. Other than that, the awful voice acting contributes a lot to the annoyance factor of the game. I'd have to guess that the devs decided to do the voices themselves--which was a bad decision considering their broken English (they're from Finland). The soliloquies are stupid too ('Are you losing it? I am not.' 'It's good to be on this side of the bow.').  I've sunk a decent amount of hours into this game (30+ at this time of writing), so the game was still a lot of fun despite my complaints. I think I got to Nightmare mode and then stopped because of all the random unavoidable deaths. I don't think I will be spending much more time playing this game, unless they hopefully fix some of these problems with the upcoming expansion. Overall I still definitely recommend this game for a lot of hours of fun (even more so with co-op) especially given its low price.  TL;DR: Devs are obsessed with Blizzard games. Insane difficulty spikes. Broken stat system. Still a fun co-op experience for many hours.  EDIT: They added a mana management system that sucks all the fun out of the game. I don't recommend this anymore.",
