            "review_text": "Very impressed with this game overall. Although it is not open world, it does well to make you feel like you aren't trapped. I usually get really annoyed with games that do not have a jump key but rarely in this game do you feel that your life would be easier if it did. They also did a very good job of Venice. I doubt it bares much resemblance to the real city but it looks very impressive and feels huge while not taking an annoyingly long time to get around.  I was dissappointed when it ended, it wasn't a bad ending, I just felt there could have been more to it. It took me 22 hours to complete 1 playthrough doing all the side quests.  8-9/10",

            "review_text": "Well, Venetica has some nice systems, you can make good combos and the mental and physical skills are interesting, they make the game be really rpg-esque. Also, it has a lot of quests and the heroine has a somewhat nice motive.  The history can be pretty quick in the beginning though, the game begins and suddenly you already have all of your motives. The game also seems to have a system of good/evil, which is good.  The graphics are not that nice, but for a game of its age it is understandable, also the graphics are ok in the fact that it does not make the game problematic because of it.  It plays like a mmo, so, those that likes these types of game can have fun with it. Although the game lacks something that I can't really tell. You may buy it, but wait for a sale.",

            "review_text": "It's a bit of a mess. This game has outdated models and animations (which is to be expected for a 2009 game using the Odin 3D open source engine), it's full of minor bugs, can get a bit repetitive, and it doesn't even have St. Mark's Square, which should be a given for a game called Venetica.  Yet, it's a fantasy RPG, and it's not 'the' Venice, it's just 'a' Venice (just like Brugge and other cities famous for their canals), more precisely Deck 17's Venice, and to me they perfectly captured the spirit of an ancient city of wonders. In fact, I thoroughly 100%'ed the retail game back in the day, and bought it twice here (?!) just so I could share my appreciation for itsuniverse. The heroine can be badass, most of the quests are interesting, and well, what can I say... Just treat Venetica like it's always been to me: a low-budget indie game with a lot of heart.  It's not a replacement for your Skyrim, but you might think about her at night.",

            "review_text": "A solid action-RPG game with a lot of nice quests and exploring. The intro almost put me off, but after getting past that, I found the game highly enjoyable. The story is rather interesting and the mechanics both well-functioning and intuitive. Anyone who likes RPG games in general will likely also like this game. Something I really was thrilled to see was that different merchants offered different prices on some items, so I'd have to actually consider which merchant to go to instead of just going past the first one (at least when trying to get the most coin). The quest and skill system is easy to use and some of the fights will require you to consider which weapon or strategy is most appropriate. So my view is that it's a good game for decent money (I got it on sale, but having played the game, I think it is fully worth the usual price as well). The one issue I have with the game is that it tends to stop responding on occation while loading, but it may be my computer/system instead of the game.",

Coupled with the lack of response to certain bugs, such as a conversation with a character that causes a crash every time, and has been reported by multiple people on several platforms, since January 2015 (Almost a whole year!!!) I must say that I cannot recommend this game. If the devs correct these bugs, I may change my review at that time, as there are a number of enjoyable things in this title.",
