    "description": "In Mars Colony: Frontier you can learn the hard way what life would be like if you were stranded on the red planet. In this open-world simulator, you assume the role of an astronaut who has been sent on a mission to Mars only to have turmoil on Earth extend your stay indefinitely.",

If you're okay with bugs and crashes, go for it. If not, stay FAR away.  Edit: The devs have acknowledged the bugs and are working to fix them.",

            "review_text": "Somehow the addition of humanoid mannequins that are RPG style equipment shops didn't breathe any additional life into what is fundamentally Mars Colony Challenger. Actually it made it worse, because in the first game you at least had isolation as a component. If you're stranded on Mars, how are there stores to buy stuff from? Inexplicable and nonsensical.   This franchise is as dead as the wooden NPCs in barter town here. Hyperkat needs to do something else with their time, or hire a consultant that can instruct them on what good game mechanics could be put in place.",

            "review_text": "Not remotely ready for release. Ignoring stability problems - which I haven't experienced, only read about - the state of this game is considerably less advanced that many games you can pick up from GOG and run in a DOS box. This looks like a hobbyist's valiant attempt to do something worthy, and I applaud that; but I have found the 'game' element to be catastrophically missing. If this were termed an Alpha release, that would be both realistic, and fair; terming it a Beta would be ambitious - and would put me off buying the final version. Claiming this is 'released' is terrible. Not worth the (admittedly low) price of admission. Someone may enjoy this, but the only positive reviews I've seen talk about the potential rather than the current state of things - and that reflects my view too: right now, not worth your time (let alone the money)",
