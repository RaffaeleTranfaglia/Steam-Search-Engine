            "review_text": "Would not play if it were free (I got it in a joke game bundle that includes Bad Rats), would not play if they paid me to. Can't change the graphics resolution, the 3D engine is very rudimentary and has severe texture artifacts. The handling is terrible, which has a lot to do with the fact that the controls are limited to the keyboard. You're always making a hard turn, flooring it, and braking hard.  New York City in no shape or form. The block layouts are not modeled on the actual street layout, the buildings aren't tall enough, and there are certainly not enough pedestrians or traffic lights, even if it were modeled on less dense areas of NYC like Ozone Park. It's 'NYC' because it's all on a perfect 90-degree angled grid which is basically Midtown only. It also makes no sense that there's a literal red wall marking the boundaries. Manhattan is an island; they could have simply closed off approaches to bridges and tunnels.  You could forgive that and the graphics and other things, but with the poor controls it's completely unenjoyable. It is, in fact, unfairly frustrating.",
