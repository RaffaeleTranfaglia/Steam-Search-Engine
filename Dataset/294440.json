            "review_text": "Shadowgate is a turn-based point and click adventure game where you can do practically everything, even cleaning up the castle and burning every possible pieces of furniture down. I use the term 'turn-based' here because every single step you take and every action you make brings you one step closer to your doom.  Story may seem a bit cliche, but considering that's it's a remake of a game that is almost 30 years old, I think that it's pretty much forgivable since this remake makes the game much more approachable to a wider audience.  Graphics feels top notched, and it's possibly my own computer issue or just me, but in retro graphics I can't seem to see anything that resembles anything. It's just a mish-mash of coloured pixels when trying to play in that mode.  Music can sometimes feel a bit eerie, giving you the 'all-alone' feel which suits this theme and setting well.  UI feels a bit clunky if you use solely mouse to play, but fares better combining mouse and keyboard.  Difficulty is a welcome feature in this game as it makes it more approachable to people new to this kind of game especially where death looms at every step. It changes the amount of time (turns) you have left to complete tasks, especially the game in terms of torch life. It also changes the location of items as well as how much more complicated item combinations and puzzles will be.",

            "review_text": "Journey once more into the castle Shadowgate  Do you remember having a favorite video game that it seemed not many other people fully appreciated? One that you were completely obsessed with, spent tons of time with played over and over again, gathered every bit of information on it that you could? For some people, the games that they find themselves so devoted to end up becoming big series, with numerous sequels. For others, those games get periodic sequels and live on. And for yet others those games just sort of fade away, becoming forgotten in time.  For a while, it seemed that Shadowgate would be one of those games in that last group. Certainly, it was much-loved by a number of people who experienced the original adventure on NES, Macintosh, and PC. And, the series did get some sequels - a side-scrolling adventure game for the TurboDuo, and a 3D exploration game for N64, as well as a port of the original game to the Gameboy Color. But, the series never seemed to receive quite the appreciation that it deserved, and, after those N64 and GBC versions in 1999, the series seemed to slip away. While the series, or mentions of the series, would pop up occasionally, it was never anything significant. And, after a while, it seemed all hope was gone, and the legend of Shadowgate would be lost to the passage of time.  Sometimes, however, all it takes is a few dedicated people to make something happen. And fortunately for the Shadowgate series, it had two extremely dedicated people - Dave Marsh and Karl Roelofs - who had been with the series since the beginning, who still maintained that love for the series after all those years, who wanted to see the series live and thrive again. They surrounded themselves with a great group of talented people at Zojoi, acquired the rights to the Shadowgate franchise, and set out to find if there was still a desire to see Shadowgate live again. And, through the relatively new (especially at the time in 2012) format of Kickstarter, soon found out that there were nearly 3500 people were still passionate about Shadowgate, and wanted to see it brought back to life. And, after over a year and a half of work, that dream finally become a reality, with the new Shadowgate game!  The first thing that should be clarified/emphasized with regards to the new Shadowgate game is that it is not simply a port/remake of the original Shadowgate. While it is based off of the original Shadowgate, and shares similarities with it, there is a significant amount of new content - rooms, items, descriptions, everything that goes into making the game. So, anyone who has played the original who is expecting to simply blow through this game in short order is in for a big surprise.  That said, the new Shadowgate shares much in common with the original, where it is a near certainty that anyone who enjoyed the original will enjoy the new Shadowgate as well. All of the core aspects of a good Adventure game are here. In your journey through the castle Shadowgate and surrounding areas, you will be exploring through a wide variety of locations, gathering hints, clues and information, discovering items and putting them to use, solving puzzles, uncovering mysteries, all while working toward your end goal. The challenge and adventure of Shadowgate is alive and well, and fans of the series will be thrilled to see all of this brought into a new game so well.  For people who are new to the series, or to the genre entirely, the new Shadowgate also provides as an excellent entry point. There are three different difficulties - allowing one to experience the adventure while working through different amounts of puzzles, different challenges, and more forgiving circumstances. There is also an optional hint system in place, where one can make use of a companion to receive information about situations and guidance toward solutions. So, one can start on a level where one is comfortable, and work up through the difficulties and help with those difficulties, until one is a master of the castle.  In bringing Shadowgate to a new generation, new expectations, and new groups of fans, Zojoi have brought the game up-to-speed not only with regards to the puzzles and adventure, but in the graphics and music as well. Each area - old and new - is beautifully illustrated, to make each room come alive. In addition, a wonderful soundtrack has been created for this game, each piece of which which perfectly fits and sets the mood for the rooms and the entire game.  For those with a fondness for the original soundtrack and style of the original game, however, there are a set of options - for audio, text, and transitions - which can be toggled on or off individually, to provide for a more 'retro' style of play. The audio allows one to experience either the new soundtrack, or the NES one. The text option causes text to appear letter by letter, drawn by a quill. And, the transition option causes the more blocky style of moving from room to room, as opposed to more blurred option of the newer version. Each of these, depending on one's preference, can either provide for a more 'retro' feel on a newer adventure, or allow one to experience an entirely new adventure altogether.  Between the different difficulties, different challenges, new things to explore and discover and overcome on each difficulty, new details to notice, and an intricate story to uncover, as well as the various options for display and experience of the game, there are many reasons to play through Shadowgate multiple times. While it's easy enough to do a quick playthrough of the game on the easiest difficulty with hints, it's a very rewarding experience to play through at the hardest difficulty without any hints. That may be a bit much to tackle the first time through the game, however, even for seasoned Shadowgate veterans, and so going through the game multiple times on different difficulties to uncover increasingly more of the game is highly recommended. Even beyond that, however, the world of Shadowgate is so rich and rewarding that it will continually draw one back into its world, to explore and experience it time and again.  The new Shadowgate game takes as a starting point the original Shadowgate, and builds off of it to bring forth a game which is similar in style, while still modern and up-to-date; a game which has a similar feel, yet doesn't feel archaic; a game which stays true to the roots of the original, while providing a significantly new experience; and which takes a franchise that at one time, and for so long, had seemed lost to the ages and tales of the past, and brings it once more to the forefront of gaming. The new Shadowgate is not meant to merely be a one-off thing either. Having seen the passion and love that still exist for the franchise, Zojoi have plans to bring Shadowgate as a franchise back to life, continuing to combine old and new as old adventures are revived, forgotten tales are brought to the fore, hidden information is revealed, and bright future is once more in sight.  It's not very often that a game like the new Shadowgate comes along. A beautiful blend of old and new, a game which will appeal to fans of the series, fans of the genre, and people new to both of them. A game in a series which for so long had seemed lost and without hope, brought back to life, not in just a simple port or in a cheap use of the name, but in a lovingly-crafted game, both a tribute to what has come before, and a promise of what is to come. Dave Marsh, Karl Roelofs, and everyone at Zojoi, have created a masterpiece with Shadowgate. The series is once more in good hands, and the future is brighter than it has ever been.  Journey once more into the castle Shadowgate!",

            "review_text": "I was excited to see yet another old game I played on NES had been remade and released on Steam (the other being Gauntlet)! The original was released in 1989 on the NES, and was a lot of fun (though very difficult) when I played it as a kid.   The new one is just as tough, and has a new and very beautiful art style. A nice soundtrack was made for this as well, though after exploring the options menu I saw there were options to make this game feel more like the original, 'retro' Shadowgate. One of those options was to have the old soundtrack play instead! There's other options as well to make it feel more like the old version. They did good there.  So what is this game...well it's an old school point-and-click adventure game. Extremely heavy puzzle elements that will get you killed and/or confused. A lot. There are ways for you to fail this game, without you even knowing it right away too. You'll be unlocking new areas, as well as a fair amount of backtracking. There are also a lot of items to be had, you'll want to get most of them because you never know when they might be of use.  They've introduced some different difficulty settings, and the ability to either play the game with no saves or with the ability to save. Unless you have the hints option on, there's really not much in the way of handholding. And even with the hints, it doesn't really tell you much.  Great game, and worth checking out if you like games that really make you think and pay attention to details.  'It's a sad thing that your adventures have ended here.' Get used to seeing that a lot.",

            "review_text": "Not many adventure games reached the classic NES, but Shadowgate was a stand-out among the few that did. The merciless journey through a deadly castle allowed you unprecedented freedom to Take, Open, Drink, and Hit just about anything you came across in the game world. Now Shadowgate has been re-imagined for the modern era, which means new graphics and new interfaces for a new audience. Surprisingly, it might still be plenty familiar to the masochists that loved the original as well.  The first place new Shadowgate diverges from the original is in the story, though it might not be immediatly apparent how much it does. You, being a strapping young warrior, are summoned by a mysterious wizard to the living castle of Shadowgate. Within its lethal, enchanted walls is an evil warlock seeking some world-ending power, and it's your job to puzzle up a way to stop him. Along the way you'll learn plenty about the circle of wizards who once inhabited the castle, the power they protected, and the lands beyond.  In terms of gameplay, this is a first-person point-and-click adventure. Each room is a static scene with features to examine and items to gather. Clicking on something brings up a context menu that allows you to perform all sorts of actions like looking, taking, opening, using, and more. Some items need to be used on yourself, some need to be combined, and so on. The objects you find are also helpfully sorted by type, which is a blessing once you realize how many damn scrolls you're going to find.  The other thing you'll find is a plethora of ways to die. OG Shadowgate wasn't shy about murdering you for daring to pick up a book or dipping your toe in a pool of water, and the remake carries over some of that, though most are locked behind the game's many difficulty levels. Most fatalities will come at the hands of the few monsters that serve to block your progress at different points. They tend not to be hard to dispatch but there's usually one correct option among a mess of more obvious ones. For example, one enemy can be dealt with by simply punching it in the face, but using any sort of weapon or spell on it means instant death.  This also brings me to my chief complaint about the game, the obscurity of some of the puzzles. Adventure games have thankfully moved far away from the days of cat hair mustaches and helium bubblegum tooth heists, but some still have problems directing the player to the right conclusions. There are plenty of puzzles in Shadowgate that have simple solutions that simply aren't telegraphed in any way, like the cure for the banshee curse or the ability to remove runes. You're sure to run into situations where you know what to do but not HOW precisely to do it, but also situations where it's just not clear how to progress.  Luckily this isn't a particularly damning complaint, because the game provides significant help like a very specific hint system (his name is Yorick) and a useful map that marks important points of interest. It also helps that you'll be exploring some rather lovely painted scenery, accompanied by quality sound work and inspiring riffs on the original soundtrack. And there are even retro options that make the game more like the original, setting some of the gameplay systems and interfaces and even the music back to their classic incarnations.  It's something you don't often see in remakes, a gradient of options between old and new, but it illustrates the love and attention that went into making it. And it doesn't hurt that there's a quality adventure that stands on its own hidden underneath. There's enough of the original Shadowgate here that longtime fans will appreciate the arcane puzzles and sudden fatalities, along with enough innovation to keep newcomers hooked.",

            "review_text": "Shadowgate may or may not be a thing that you remember from the past. If you do remember it, there are several possible versions across different platforms that you may remember. The version of Shadowgate that I remember is the NES version. I never owned the game, but I rented it a few times and enjoyed it. When I saw that someone was remaking it, I had to check it out.  For the most part, the 2014 remake of Shadowgate is faithful, while also being respectful in its adaptation. This isn't a 100% translation. While some things you may remember from the past are still present in this version of the game, others may be absent or changed, while new puzzles and features have been added. The spirit of what made Shadowgate great is intact however and that's what's most important.  It would be easy to quibble over the changes and additions made to this version of the game, but ultimately they are no better or worse than what was in the game to begin with. Certain puzzles still require odd leaps of logic and certain connections sometimes feel a bit stretched, but I've experienced worse and in the context of the game world it's forgivable. Ultimately I enjoyed Shadowgate and the addition of difficulty levels (with differing puzzles and win conditions) and achievements for time and turn limits, mean that there's decent replayability here. It's a classic game remade well and worth checking out. I'm looking forward to the next offering from this team.",

            "review_text": "Unfortunately this remake has many issues that keep it from being enjoyable.  The UI is very clunky, and even with hotkeys, is a burden to use. The inventory when pulled up covers the entire screen, so the selection process is (pull up inventory, select 'USE', select item in inventory, close inventory, click what to use item on) and it slows down the pace and makes trying different solutions VERY frustrating. Also, to interact with an object, you have to 'USE' yourself on it, so again, (USE, click your portrait, click item to interact with) it's incredibly clunky and makes the mediocre puzzles even worse to deal with. At the very least, the hotkeys can be rebound.  The auto-save in the NES version is better than this one. You should manually 'quick-save' by hitting F5 in every room, and then when you do have to restart you have to go through a load menu and select your file, it's just bad.  Oh P.S. I hope you enjoy a long-term game over timer w/o good indicators on top of the perfectly fine torch system. You get a mandatory curse fairly early on, and eventually, you will just lose. For me this was 2 hours into the game. 2 hours after getting the curse, I had to restart the game. That's poor game design and a relic of an era that they even got rid of after Uninvited because they realized it was â™¥â™¥â™¥â™¥ back in 1987.  The charm of the original game is completely gone, no longer will you die 30 times in the first 5 rooms in amusing ways. They actively make it difficult to die, which is just so so so wrong.  Even if you loved Shadowgate, I would recommend not picking this up, or at least waiting for it to be &lt;$5.",

If your a novice puzzle solver you can play this on the easy difficulty (if your a cry baby) but it nerfs the challenge in avoiding deaths, less puzzles, solutions will be solved for you, some puzzle rooms will be unloseable but that doesn't mean you won't die on easy mode because you still can from tons of trial and error.

I'm actually so glad they re-made it and if you can appreciate this game for what it is, you should be able to appreciate what Kemco had to work with back in 1987 as a point and click Adventure game! The game now has a more in-depth storyline, tricky puzzles and animations that were once still pixelated images of rooms in the Castle Shadowgate. If you enjoy point and click puzzle game apps on your smart phone, you'll definitely enjoy this game. If you are indeed new to this game, stop reading right here and ignore my critique of the pros and cons of the game else you'll forever curse yourself with many spoilers! I don't mean to spoil this game too much, but I'd like to share my concerns and thoughts with the community that have been waiting for this game to be re-made for so very long.  **SPOILER ALERT**  If you are already familiar with the 1987 Kemco Shadowgate realm, continue reading this scroll as it will disappear once you finished reading it! You won't learn any new spells, but you may either want to agree or disagree with some of the points I have to make about the re-make of the already awesome Shadowgate game by Kemco.  Now First off, I've got to say, I was a little disaappointed with some of the many things they left out of the game. Now, I'm a HUGE fan of the Classic game and I pay alot of attention to detail. So much, in fact, that I fashioned an entire map on Minecraft of a Shadowgate Replica with working traps and exact(: as much as Minecraft can provide) room structure. It took me a HELL of a long time to make. Now on to the pros and cons.  The Pros: (Simple and Sweet) -Great Artwork and Animation (Beautiful done) -Interesting use of Puzzles and New ones added (Alot the same as the classic but some new ones that boggled my mind) -Beautiful Story telling (Got more out of the story than just being placed in a world where I have to kill a warlock lord) -Improved versions of Songs used in the original (Feelings of Nostalgia once I played) -Great new tip system (helped me out alot in situations compared to the original)  The Cons: (Now I know it's not the same game but I was expecting certain similarities and some were frustrating because it didn't make sense, but others are minor) -Not all the rooms were re-worked (we're missing a few rooms from the original which were key to storyline) -Enemies were placed in different locations (as well as some being left out or changed, it was exciting but also, I was expecting sharks instead of an octopus/squid. Also, the Goblin had to be punched instead of hit with a rock and slingshot) -Alot of the story was changed (such as the Behemoth being attacked would result in death, the warlock lord being attacked would also result in death. I would like someone to explain to me, why the Elemental Spirits are 'Evil' according to the hint given? Doesn't make much sense... Would have been alright if you used the staff of ages on the warlock Lord instead. -Some music was left out (There were plenty of GREAT tracks in the classic Shadowgate, almost one for each room. Some of the rooms had the same track of the first room playing. I just think they should have kept the music of each room after re-working it, I bought the DLC with the soundtrack and I only admired one song which is the end credits due to it going through every track Shadowgate had in a guitar rock style. Other than that, the rest of the music is the same style, slow and creepy. Still good but I think they really could have done so many more orchestrations and I'm not sure what their reason is for not making more for the game.  So there, that's my thoughts on such a great game! Most of my cons were more towards a critical point of view but it still should not deter anyone (new or veteran) from buying and playing this game. Regardless of the Cons I give it a 5/5 for being re-worked and bringing this overly critical guy some Nostalgia. I beat the game in normal mode, I'm going to try the harder modes to see if maybe i missed something. I'll check back and possibly re-tract some of my Cons in the future. Enjoy this game!!! :)",

Once in a while you see a game advertised as 'old school adventure puzzle,' and what do you find? The game is too easy. The puzzles are straightforward, too easily solved, and there's never enough death to punish the player. Sometimes the game won't even kill the player at all. So when a remake of the original Shadowgate was announced, my one fear was that it was now going to be too easy. Little did I know the game would be every bit as difficult as the original.  It's as difficult as the original, but not quite as brutal. The original Shadowgate sometimes had passages you could move into that existed only to kill you the moment you went into them. Or it had traps that came out of nowhere with no hint you were walking into a trap. In this manner, Shadowgate has done away with the cheap kills, doing away with the need to constantly save in every room.  Some gamers may not be able to embrace this style of gaming anymore. Its point and click and the gameplay revolves entirely on selecting verbs to interact with the objects, like 'use sword on goblin.' But for me, this is pure good nostalgia. Shadowgate is a game I grew up with and this is a great return to form. It's close enough to the original to push all the nostalgia buttons, but it has its own new cool style as well. The puzzles are familiar, but never quite the same as the original game. In my own subjective opinion I couldn't have asked for a better remake. I only hope they give Deja Vu and Uninvited the same treatment.",

            "review_text": "I did not enjoy the adventure/puzzle aspect of the game I just did not find it interesting or fun, it's not as hard as it is obtuse its more about exploration than anything else. I didn't like that there is just a ton of going back and forth and the game has 100+ rooms if you think about it the game is just a corridor of rooms you go up and down over and over. Then with the pick-ups the vast majority of them do nothing and are just there for flavor. Surprisingly there are not a lot of items needed to beat the game. I suppose the difficulty is primarily based on your time limit more than puzzles but I find that just makes the game more annoying because then you have to restart completely if you run out of time.  What I do consider good about this game is that they built a world because there is just so much stuff that has nothing to do with the solution there are even side-quests and many things that you will not see if you only stick to the path. There is still a problem with that though because its a time limited game I don't feel that the exploration aspect really fits though I do applaud the fact that it is there.   The extra difficulties are nice as well, especially since they made the puzzles different, so playing on higher difficulties changes the game slightly. Unfortunately I don't find the lower difficulties to be necessary. They are too easy and master difficulty is not any harder just 'longer' by a few steps here and there. I think there's a stigma that this game is super hard and they tried to reinforce this with the difficulty levels but starting at anything below master is really just a waste of time.  In closing I also want to say I was a bit disappointed in that there were not as many deaths as I thought there would be because I thought that was a big part of the game. I might have fallen from a few things or gotten shanked by some goblins but nothing I didn't see coming. From what I understand most of the deaths, or at least the good ones, you have to actually try to find. If you stick to solving the game though you will not die very often or at all which is the opposite of what I was expecting.",

Those dedicated to discern the different ways to proceed/fail and skewer a dragon or become shish-kabobbed and flambÃ©ed by a fire drake. This game will test your mettle in wit, not how fast you can dodge, jump, twist and/or somersault. This is pure gameplay in terms of survival using your intelligence, not your elite gaming skills al a Mario, Sonic, Master Chief or Samus Aran. This game will confuse you. Corner you. Disuade you from pushing forward. And you will die. A lot. But that is okay, because what you will also do is relish in your achievements as you figure things out for yourself and not rely on the internet for the answer. This game is not so hard you will break a keyboard, but it worth every penny for what it is priced.  I am also one who grew up Atari/Nintendo and still own this title on my 8-bit NES and this game pays true homage to the way it was. The retro sound is awesome, and they even kept the retro controls although I have finally adapted to the newer controls with the right-clicking; but they are not mandatory, the controls of old are still there, just not in the NES format to a T...just slightly modified but work the same. The retro graphics look a little off to me, but then again, we are in the day of 1080p-4K and there is only so much you can do to make it look good, yet old. So props to the developer for a great job on both aspects.  I still love to play the original and my Shadowgate 64 every couple of years to keep my wits about me and it never gets old. I hope they go to the newer edition from here, but if not, I cannot justify any negativity for the game this is and I am proud for how this turned out in the end.  This is a must-own title. Especially if you want to test yourself to your wits end...",

Decades later and here is the remastered version!  The story is very satisfying in the way you feel every time you get to the next part of the story after doing some puzzles that you truly earned it.  The game is set up in three modes Easy, Normal, Hard. The Harder the game the harder the puzzles.  The game is pretty much point and click. You go threw dungeons and click the next screen, locate and find items, weapons, spells, and Ghosts/demons/etc Make sure you have the right things equipped for the rooms ahead and use everything you got on everything in the room. Smash Mirrors with hammers, Fight or avoid dragons, Smack a talking skull upside the head, steal all the torches you can get into your bag and talk to a really old wizard that will show you the way to kick an evil Warlocks butt!  PROS:  The Art Style is fantastic Voiceovers are done well The Music is gripping. The puzzles are done amazingly well and still stand up today. You carry a talking skull named Yorik with you who helps you out in a jam or cracks jokes at your expense.   CONS: The Person reading this thinks the game stinks because they are not good at puzzles.  Rate 10/10",

This game is good...but it could have been better.  I'd recomment this game to those that played the original. It offers a new look at the puzzles and traps that made the original so fun to play, but the archaic interface and play style will most likely not resonate with newer players, who expect epic storylines and an acceptable difficulty level.  Shadowgate is HARD. One mistake, especially on Master level, can spell death. If you love a challenge, and a dated interface is no problem for you, then try Shadowgate.",
