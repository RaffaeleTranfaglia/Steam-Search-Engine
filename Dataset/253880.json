            "review_text": "Underrated story and gameplay, a lot of overhanging plot-points and a pretty good meta-aspect to the gameplay bu using a 'main base'. The resource system works brilliantly and forces the player to chose between finishing the game sooner and researching/building more units to help with future missions. This combined with the timed story, as in you only have a limited time to reach your goal, puts the pressure on the player troughout the game and forces the player to make quick decitions and not spend ages planning. Without a doubt one of my favorite games of all time.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely one of the BEST RTS games out there. I've bought this game three times already... In any case, the gameplay is just as innovative now as it was back in... Well, I don't remember. I was literally a kid then. Games are only just now starting to pick up on the complexity and customization that this game brought to the table, and its graphics honestly still look pretty damn good, especially considering its age.  On the note of graphics, on both my hard copy and  GOG.com  copy, there is widescreen incompatibilities that will crash the game. This is simply because widescreen didn't actually exist when the VooDoo APIs (remember those beasts?) were written. Fixing it is fairly simple though. Look up nGlide, download the driver package and executable, configure and enjoy. Basically what it does is trick that old VooDoo software into thinking it is still in 4:3 while you're running 16:9 or 16:10 formats, plus it'll work with any game that was programed for those old VooDoo GPUs. Mechwarrior 3, here I come!  Gameplay wise, this game is both forgiving and unforgiving. The campaigns are long, and its amongst the few games that allows you to continue the campaign even after losing missions and battles. That's the forgiving part... The unforgiving part is that the game is basically a resource rush, battling relentless and challenging AIs over resources and trying to mine them out and send them back to your main base. While the game gives you plenty of opportunity to achieve your goals, the AI is very intelligent, and will stop at nothing to end you. Failing and/or fumbling battles too much will result in watching your people die in a firey apocalypse, and there won't be jack ♥♥♥♥ you can do about it. That being said, there is a huge number of missions for each campaign, some of which are only available under certain circumstances such as 'Lose here...' or 'Win there...' or the like.  The game provides a huge variety and complexity in units, weapons, and research, all of which makes for customizable units to a degree unseen in RTS with the exception of maybe Sid Meier's Alpha Centauri. Throughout the game, whether in single or multiplay, you're have to balance cost, quality, quantity, and power for your units, weapons, and research, and rushing tech is much more complex than you'd see in other RTS like StarCraft or Dawn of War. Overall, each faction has a huge variety of units and lacks the over-simplified 'this unit counters this' dynamic that seems to be so prevalent in RTS these days.  If this game has shortcoming at all, and obviously I don't think it does, it would be in its story. The game runs on a simple premise, described in the manual, box, and on the Steam page, of 'The world was nuked to death by UCS Robots, and its orbit was disrupted enough that it's orbit has started to destabalize and move ever closer to the sun... So GTFO of dodge.' Granted, a little bit more story is conveyed through mission briefings which are simple emails that you can read, but they can be generally skipped and are rather dull outside of the odd running joke. You make your own story in where you choose to go in the capaigns, and how you choose to handle each battle. Personally, I prefer this method, as games like Homeworld 2 get obnoxious with their incessant in-game cutscenes and endless hand-holding. I'd rather play my game, not watch it.  Overall, I'd say that Earth 2150 is the most innovative RTS out there, and certainly amongst my favorites along with Dawn of War, Homeworld, and the first StarCraft. It surpassed its predecessor 'Earth 2140,' and set a high bar that its sequel, 'Earth 2160,' sadly fell just short of. If you're a hardcore RTS player, I highly recommend this game.  I forgot to mention a couple things... The controls are quite unfamiliar. Being amongst the first 3D RTS games out there, they messed with the controls quite a bit. Being that this game lacks a tutorial, I strongly suggest downloading the manual, or finding a quick reference guide for the controls. Also, the prerendered cutscenes in this game are pretty damn awesome. Sadly, they are compressed to hell because they use the old bink codecs, but the quality really is top notch. Think about what CG looked like in 2000, then compare it to this... Really, the only places you'll find better is in studios like Blizzard.",

            "review_text": "Earth 2150 redefined the notion of having mixed feelings from a game on Steam. Beeing a trilogy,it has the original game and the two standalones. To review this game, as a whole package ill use a list of Pros and Cons,and I’ll leave you to figure out if its worth it or not. PROS: - You can “create” your own type of units by combining chasis with addons - Structures can be updated with turret defenses - The three factions are very unqiue and attractive to try out - Story has an interesting premise that keeps you engaged initially - You can reshape the terrain and build tunnels/bridges as part of your strategy - You always have a main base and a mission base - Music is better than in Earth 2140 - 360 degrees rotation and zooming on the game screen - Feels like a “deeper” Command&amp;Conquer initially - Game mechanics are really well done (probably the best part of the game) - Each unit has a depleteable ammo stack and needs to be supplied with more ammo - The research tree is quite impressive - Game can be played with air ,ground and tunnel fights - There is a transport vehicle that moves units from main base to mission base - Day/Night cycle and weather system - Each faction has unique superweapons - You can queue unlimited units/research and resources will be consumed gradually for them - Units can be assigned scripts - Lost souls has an actual chronological story - The concepts were unique and breathtaking for its genre and quite ahead of their time - The news reports,build up slowly but they give a sense of danger regarding Earth’s fate - Buildings leave debris after you destroy them - Earth progressively decays with the advancement of the campaign - Weather affects units and buildings  CONS: - It has not aged well at all, the graphics being really washed down - Tutorials are very tedious and not straightforward - The path finding is horrible - The voice overs are annoying and too cheesy - The story becomes forgetful because too many pointless gather x minerals missions - Learning curve is too steep - Missions seem too hard even on Easy difficulty - Music is too repetitive - Too many missions are gather missions (especially with ED) - The unit limit seemed small - Figuring what to do is too hard. I had no idea what to do half of the time I played - Game play feels too slow and sluggish - The ammo sluppying while interesting,it gets boring really fast - To me the AI seemed too hard because of the steep learning curve. - No real sense of achievement after completing several missions - Each mission is a big time sink and becomes boring - Your army can be immediately killed if it is facing some type of enemies - The fighting targeting is horrible because of the path finding - Your units will keep being hit and move around to position themselves before attacking - There is a lights on/off on buildings and units which seems completely pointless - The maps are too big and annoying to navigate through - The minimap layout is extremly horrible,rotation makes even more confusing - The minimap is basically uselss,as it doesn’t help you at all during missions - The multiplayer is obviously dead and its game modes are severely outdated - The story fails to deliver in the end - The cinematics are pointless and too cheesy. They don’t add any value to the story - Game feeling bounces from really like it or really hate it too frequently - The expansion moon project worse than the original game in most aspects : especially story  - The terrain and movement on the terrain is agonizing to look at and wait upon - Unit selection is faulty when you have a lot of units on screen - The game feels too often like a chore than actual fun - Missions rarely vary from gather resource/destroy enemy base/escort transporters - The fighting music is too irritating and repetitive - The ending for each faction felt anticlimactic and non emotional. - Last impression was that game missions take too long and don’t have enough to keep you wanting to come back   Overall,I cannot say that I would recommend this trilogy. It has its PROS but it also has too many CONS for me to really like it. You can make your own decision, but I for one,really forced myself to play and experience as much as possible from this game.",

If you can get it working there’s no options, no tutorial and it gives you no idea what you’re doing or anything. The graphics setting are out of the game but are exceptionally buggy (I have two monitors and it defaulted me to 640x864 (not a typo) when one is 1360x760 and the other is 1920x1080, by turning the 1360x760 one off, it defaulted to 640x864 as well) After messing in config files for 30 mins I got it to work at 1080p (which is one of the settings, it just doesn’t save it when u start the game) and starting the game showed me a 360p video (stretched so looked ugly as hell) an a menu that looked just as bad, with no options for mouse settings, key bindings or anything, the game barley works and should not be bought. Finally getting it working to a reasonable standard and find that there’s no tutorial, and the game gives me no idea what to do, the UI is clunky and the mouse sensitivity is WAY too high with no way to change it, brilliant start... So far I've managed to start a game with a bot but with no instructions and only 5 buildings to choose from, I have to question the other reviews, as there is no way that this can be an 'amazing rts' to quote one of them. If I’m missing something, please tell me, as I have no idea what I'm doing and a tutorial or guide would be nice. so would a graphics setting where the ground has a higher resolution that minecraft.",
