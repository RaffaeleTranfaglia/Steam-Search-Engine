I dont really see a point rather then playing this and messing around in it to waste time. Rather when it gets updated and the developer/s stay on top of it i have a good feeling about this game and may be fairly fun and unique, plus its $1.99 so like why not lol, i was gonna get a refund but then i was like 'It's only $1.99 so it cant really hurt to keep it' and that's where making this review came from ;w; But i think this game has alot of potential and keep up the work developer/s :)",
