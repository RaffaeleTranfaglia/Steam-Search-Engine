    "description": "Track the Bad Guys, be brutal and smart in your planning, and eliminate them one by one. But bear this in mind: each criminal’s death has to look like an accident. In each level, you’ll have the chance to splatter and destroy the Bad Guy using various weapons and traps.",

        {
            "review_text": "The concept is neat, but each scenario is samey, and difficulty is derived from trial and error that comes from floaty and kinaesthetically displeasing physics. Menus are fine, and the visual style is neat, but audio is best muted. Kill The Bad Guy is about figuring out exactly what the developer wants you to do, and no deviation from this course is permitted. Don't let me completely dissuade you, though - if you're genuinely interested, download the demo before you buy. I'm sure there's some audience out there for this, but I am clearly not it.",
