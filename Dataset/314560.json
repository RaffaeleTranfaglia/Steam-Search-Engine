            "review_text": "I am conflicted with Kyn.   On the one hand the developers are great at responsing to their customers and have really done a great job in creating such a pretty game. Visually it is a treat and for the most part the game is great. Many people like it and gave it good reviews and they are fine.   I have never had so much trouble deciding if to recommend a game or not as I have with this game, there is nothing wrong in partiular with the game, just a lot of little things that add up to making me regret my purchase. I undersatnd the combat and the skills after playing games like Pillars of Eternity and enjoy the system, but it feels totally unblanced and bland, many skills being worthless and only being able to equip 2 skills and 1 feed skill per character at any time feels limiting.  The maps are linear which is fine, but they feel too big for what they are and many times you find yourself going exploring expecting to find something cool only to be met with a dead end and nothing there. Which brings me to chests. To open a chest the team 'attack it' which seems odd considering chest have hinges and handles and could be just opened, it felt like they ran out of time to make an opening chest animation.   Also the loot is very boring, 90% crafting material and not much actual gear. Which is fine, because there is a lot of things to craft, but again, with the crafting the loot drops are pointless because you can buy all the crafting material from the vendor next to the crafter. It just feels unecessary.  Is a shame cause I was really excited to play the game, but it just feels like an early access title to me, which to the developers credit they are doing a stellar job listening to the community and are in the process of adding a rotating camera, so I still hold hope of being able to finish the game one day, but added to the long load times every time you die I simply do not have the drive to play the game. I really want to get into it, but like a word you are on the brink of remembering I just cannot find that spark.  TL:DR it is not a bad game, in fact in many ways it is good, but sadly it lacks atmosphere.",

            "review_text": "Played through the first stages and couldn't slog through the rest.  It's not a terrible game, but it's nothing special. Definition of run-of-the-mill. Bad camera(even with the newer rotate feature), boring combat, non-existent story, annoying UI. Often characters just stop auto attacking and die or just stand there. Just not great.  If you've never played a game of it's kind EVER before, you may enjoy it. Other than that, you'll know this is mediocrity.",

            "review_text": "SO, Kyn.   It's a good introduction to the party RPG. Combat is gratifying and easy, Like Diablo but also has more management involved. Characters only have 2 skills and one feed skill, so if you're not brilliant at micromanaging everyone at the same time you don't have too much to wrap youself around.  Item stats in the game are really straightforward with an easy to read UI. The game does involve crafting, but don't let it be too daunting, All of the materials can be purchased in town with the rarer ones costing upwards of 4k - 8k gold. There is a very large variation when it comes to weapon and armour skins, which is always nice, Being able to change the colour of your armour at any point is also really good.  Now the only gripes I have with this game. Most of the skills seem rather worthless, There are alot of skills that achieve the same goal but just in different less efficient ways. Most of the first tier spells are often the best spells, The taunt for Body users is ridiculously good.   I wish there was more customisation to do with your actual characters, I understand that there are characters that are involved with the story and it does bring a better all round storytelling experience, But since the characters don't have any voices (Yet ?) I don't see how conversation couldn't be as simple as just changing names and certain situational quotes. I also feel like you gather your full party at a rather slow speed. At around the halfway point of the game you still only have about 4 - 5 members out of the full 6.   So here's my rundown.  Pros: -Easy introduction to the Genre -Nice micromanagement -Good stats system -Nice crafting -Good variation in items -Nice UI -Enjoyable story with likeable characters  Cons: -Skills feel lacking at later tiers -Feel slightly detached from the characters -Slow progression which feel monotonous at time  So all in all, the game is very enjoyable and is quite cheap for the content it offers. The development team are also really active and helpful to anyone who has issues adn they are not afraid to add major game changers like the Rotating camera. Enjoyable game. Had fun playing it. 10/10 would buy a sequel.",
