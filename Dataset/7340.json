            "review_text": "Azada is a point-and-click puzzle game. It's a very short game, consisting of ten chapters with nine puzzles a piece. There a handful of basic puzzle forms, including Memory/Concentration, 'Move the Matches', Match 3, Sliders, et cetera, that recur throughout the game. The puzzles scale slightly in difficulty as the game progresses, and each chapter ends with a jig-saw-esque puzzle that works toward completing a portrait of a man you're rescuing. (If it sounds very MYST, that's because it is.) It's a short game, there's not a lot to say, so let's get to it!  The Good:  - Visuals are good. The game is older, but doesn't look -terribly- dated. It's a point-and-click game that has since ported over to mobile devices, and its success there is a result of its low-intensity graphics.  - Music might be the best part. The music sounds much higher quality than I expected.  - This is a great game for killing time. None of the puzzles are too challenging, and only took me a couple minutes at best.  The Bad:   - None of the puzzles are too challenging, and only took me a couple minutes at best. A few of the 'click to find' landscapes were difficult, but not because the puzzle itself was difficult, but because these games sometimes fall into the trap of making you hunt for individual pixels. Aggravating.  Conclusions?  This game is not especially challenging. I don't know that there's much more to say. I liked it, but it wasn't overly stimulating. Great for your mom, maybe?",
