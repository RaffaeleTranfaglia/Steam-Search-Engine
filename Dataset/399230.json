This game started at $20, with the devs bribing and lying to people about the costs, it went down to $10 and now it's still somehow buyable. It should be free and even if it were free I wouldn't touch it. I'd rather fill a shotgun with glass and fire it up my beautiful female genitals than play this game. It's glitchy, you can't pick up anything unless you move at the speed of f@#k and the upgrades are almost impossible to reach.   You can't find anything, you don't have nearly as enough time needed to both find and 'cook' what's needed. Just...just run. Run away, just get off this page.  Pros. Cool idea and pretty fun concept.  Variety of foods to use and free cooking ( eh..kinda)  Could be fun game if bored or low IQ  Cons. This game exists.   Waste of a good idea ",
