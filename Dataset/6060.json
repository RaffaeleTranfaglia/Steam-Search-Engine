How do we get people to pay us more for our game? If i wanted graphics I would watch a movie.  BF2 is the last battlefront ever made in my eyes. It's a good game made by people who really put love into the game and considered what other people might think is fun.

Do the math guys!  UPDATE: Battlefront 2 Sequel is getting hype because it looks aimed to fix alot of the fundamental issues with Battlefront 1, but keep in mind if they had intentions of staying true to the original, they wouldn't have tried to erase BF1 and BF2 from history by rebooting the series as 'Battlefront 2015', and since alot of these issues are inherently tied to EA business practices like DLC, Season Passes, Microtransaction elements, emphasis on Graphics over scale (64 players is basically impossible on Console with the level of graphical fidelity) and Disney's determination to erode the Prequels to the point of also removing its good elements, whilst also milking nostalgia and therefore not designing a wider more interesting selection of maps and faction design, you really gotta ask yourself if they're really gonna meet us halfway, or make effectively superficial changes that don't accurately reflect the core design philosophy of Battlefront Proper, I will delete this segment if it turns out to be good, which I think DICE is perfectly capable of, as Battlefield has alot of overlap in terms of gameplay design, but because EA now has a monopoly on Star Wars and doesn't need competition or quality to establish a pre-built fanbase that *WILL* buy this regardless, Laziness should be a concern moving foward, and the question of whether Battlefront can return as a legitimate series, or continue to be horribly missused as a form of cash cow and hype machine for Upcoming movies may be a death knell for the series  *END RANT*",

Also, it's rewarding for fans and acknoledging for newcomers to play this game. Fun is the word I use to describe this game. No bugs, big battles, many troops, many weapons, and great heroes and villans are at your disposle. The graphics may be dated, but they are detailed enough for you to enjoy what it provides and at this price, it's a real bargain.

I'm pretty sure that the only better things the new game has is decent graphics and sound effects. Other than that, it's battlefield : stars wars edition (I'm not saying that battlefield is bad nor Battlefront.).

As of July 2014 Multi-player was removed from this title but the singleplayer still provides hours of entertainment. What Battlefront 2 lacks behind in graphics it makes up with stunning gameplay. There is a variety of singleplayer gamemodes such as Instant Action, Campaign Mode and Galactic Conquest. Galactic Conquest is by far my favourite with it being much like a Star Wars edition of risk in where you command your space fleet across the galaxy defeating your opponent in both space battles and invading or defending a planet from a wave of attacks. However the campaign of this game is very short, easy and not the most entertaining with it only being about 2 hours long at most.  One of the best features about game is the ability to control your factions heroes from Mace Windu to Han Solo to Darth Vader. You can help your teammates on the battlefield (Droids, Stormtroopers, Rebels etc.) defeat their enemy with the power of a lightsaber or a scoundrel like Han (Who shot first!)   The only bad thing about this game is the lack of multiplayer, the graphics of this game are not the greatest but the game is still perfectly playable and will still provide hours of entertainment.

It stands up tall alongside popular series like CoD and Battlefield, and provides a similar experience fine-tuned to anyone who loves glowstick swords and laser beam guns. The atmosphere is great and nothing captures the feeling of playing a Jedi or a Stormtrooper on the battlefield better. The vanilla game has plenty of content, but what really makes this title shine is the rich tapestry of mods and extra user-created maps that have been contributed over the past nine years. That said, it's absolutely necessary to play the game with the Conversion Pack and Battlefront Extreme if you want the best experience possible. There are also a bunch of great maps and mods to be found in the Community Hub here on Steam as well as on Filefront, so it's worth a look if you find something you like.  Don't get too excited yet though, while it's a great game, I can tell you it hasn't aged amazingly. The classes are noticeably unbalanced and there are glaring glitches present(one involving the infamous issue of the game crashing when Stereo Mix isn't enabled). The servers aren't densely populated anymore and there are usually only one or two with around 40 players. Despite minor problems and showing age, the game is still very much worth the $10, even if you only play quick matches on Instant Action.",

This fills you in on the decision making process behind the scenes of the movies that you never really get to see, let alone hear about. You do get to play as 'heroes' or 'villians' of the Star Wars franchise if they took part in that specific battle.

            "review_text": "  -Quick Review-   Star Wars Battlefront II was a first/third person shooter released to the PlayStation2, Xbox, and PC November 1, 2005 (Reference, Steam Store). The reason I state this is because 'prepare yourself for PS2 and Xbox Generation Graphics. The game plays like a capture the flag, base control, skirmish first/third person shooter game. Recently multiplayer was lost because of GameSpy's shut down, however there are ways within the community to bring back the multiplayer features. (check out the forums, Steam or Reddit)    -Detailed breakdown review-    Story:  In the game you can play part of the story by playing Campaign Mode, 'A shadow looms over the Republic. The Clone Wars have torn a rift across the Galaxy, its populace weak in allegiance and resolve.' Basically you play the game as a member of the 501st Legion, Get used to hearing that, the clones will be sure to remind you every time you have a cut screen. You play from the Geonosis Attack, (seen in Star Wars episode 2), fight on Kashyyyk, Corescant Jedi Temple, Kamino, The Death Star Hoth, and a number of other locations seen in the Star Wars universe.   (Having a star wars nerd moment, ignore if you don't care about the Expanded star wars universe)  I do need to highlight a problem with the lore, the Clones received genetic alterations that made them age much faster than usual human beings, twice as fast to be precise. A clone surviving from the battle on Geonosis would most likely die of old age before ever reaching Hoth. Geonosis took place 22 BBY, Hoth 3 ABY, Most of the clones where in their 20's and 30's at the battle of Geonosis, so we're talking 60 to 70 year old cone troopers. But I digress, if you find this type of lore interesting I recommend checking out the Republic Commando books, I've read a great deal from them, I enjoy the Mandalorian back-story to the clone troopers.  (End of Expanded Universe Rant)    Game Play:  The game controls like a standard first/third person shooter, the reason I refer to it as first/third is that you can change which mode you're playing with the options, I really liked playing in first person because the assault rifles would have scopes then. But to be honest third is probably a better way to play (you can see more). I've never played any other Battlefront games but I assume they all have very similar controls, in this one you can jump, roll, crouch, and sprint. Sprinting and rolling require stamina to use. Each class has its own different set of abilities, skills, and tactics. There are two categories: Land classes and space classes. You can have space battles in this game. I'll stick to the land classes to give an idea of the diversity in classes: Trooper, Heavy Weapons, Sniper, Engineer, Clone commander (special class 1), Jet trooper (special class 2). the special classes change based on which faction you're playing as, you can play as the Republic, CIS, Empire, or Rebel Alliance. There are also heroes in the game, so you can get in on some awesome lightsaber massacre action. In addition to classes, there are various game modes, you can play a command and conquer style game called 'conquest' you can play through the campaign, you can simple play a sequence of matches against NPC's set to regular or elite difficulty (I generally just played offline matches against npc's).    Achievements:  There are no steam achievements for this game.    Price:  Star Wars Battlefront II $9.99, I recommend waiting for a sale, this is a very old game, and you can take your time on waiting for a great sale. I believe I purchased my copy at 75-90% off. The number of hours shown on steam is a little bit deceptive, I might only have 15 hours at this point, but I first played this game on the Playstation2, I loved it enough to buy it on steam, but it wouldn't load on my computer until I installed Windows7. So I've easily spent double that time or more. Additionally I do intend to play it more, it's one of those games where it's nostalgic value to me is high.    Conclusion:  Remember this is an older game, wait for a sale, probably should be a star wars fan to enjoy it, multiplayer requires downloading third party software or you can just play against npc's. If you don't have a problem with anything I've listed, suit up trooper, the Battle awaits you! I recommend this game.",

            "review_text": " STAR WARS™ Battlefront™ II is an intense first- and third-person shooter, developed by Pandemic Studios and released in 2005. A highly successful title due to a more narrative-focused approach, the ability to take part in battles on some of the films' most iconic locations has secured it's popularity and replay value since release, with a passionate modding community to boot.   Providing much-needed wish fulfilment and satisfaction for both Star Wars fans and gamers alike, the variety on offer here is substantial. The campaign itself takes place over both of the default eras, in which you assume the role of one of the class-types of the legendary 501st during the rise of the Empire. Most missions involve a set of objectives that introduce the player to the other game modes provided, such as Conquest, CTF, Assault or Hunt.  Most of these modes are a standard affair for the shooter genre but space battles are also available.   There's a fairly standard roster and loadout options at first, as well as the ability to unlock two higher tier classes upon exceeding a predetermined amount of points. However, the most fascinating addition to the series is the ability to unlock characters - both friend and foe - from the films and duel it out with your favourite heroes. The lightsaber gameplay is among the best the Star Wars IP is yet to see; Pandemic have absolutely nailed the feel of the various strengths and styles of the characters on offer. Though the game features some surprisingly complex A.I. enemies and teammates, it is admittedly prone to frustrating and occasionally amusing quirks. The level of difficulty and challenge is also minimal once you get the hang of it.   Outside of the campaign, the options for Instant Action and Galactic Conquest will undoubtedly please many with the ability to setup custom battles and campaigns but the true values comes from the tonne of mods available. Since the death of the Gamespy servers, unofficial clients have assumed control of the community's ongoing interest but playing on your own is just as good as it is with others. From Conquest matches that run down to the wire to extremely intense shootouts down tightly-packed corridors; one-on-one duels with lightsabers to sprawling dogfights in space, this is one of the best shooters to appear in recent years and a perfect example of both a Star Wars game and a shooter done right.

I've been playing this game since I first got my PS2, and for Nostalgia's sake, I bought it again for the PC. I must say that I didn't regret buying it again for another system because I feel like the price was worth it when I first bought it(Around 5 bucks like 2 years ago).   Even though it's 10 years old now, the game still holds up as possibly one of the best Star Wars games to have ever been made. It has a variety of locations for maps, and allowed for single player action which spanned out into either Galactic Conquest, Campaign Mode, and Instant Action. While the graphics are certainly dated, the game is so much fun to play through due to how you were really thrust into the Star Wars Universe and felt like you were just an average soldier on some sort of galactic battlefield.   Another thing this game has going for it are the mods and community created maps. While Filefront is down, you can still find a large amount of maps made by the community and mods that vastly improve the game and make it look much better than it originally was. While I would say that the game survived so long was due to nostalgia, I'd have to say it's because of the mods. The amount of side mods(Republic v. CIS, Empire v. Rebels, etc.) and interesting maps made by the modding and mapping community just give you an infinite amount of possibilities with what you can do in Star Wars Battlefront II.   I don't think any Star Wars game has had the virtue of having so many community made things for it to explore and try out like SWBII. Along with that, the fun gameplay, and nostalgia, this game is definitely worth the buy.",

You can see things from maps and units to entire game patches.   However, the game does have some major compatibility issues with Windows Vista and up. First off, the main menu is permanently stuck at a fixed resolution(you can change it from the launch options, but the entire menu will become messed up), however 1980 X 1080 is supported when in game. Second off, there's an audio bug that halts the audio for a few seconds, then continues on. That can be fixed via launch options and by enabling stereo mix in your sound settings. Now the next big thing I havn't gotten, but other have been having crashing problems. From what I heard, you can prevent it from happening if you have something plugged into your mic jack (weird solution, I know).   Aside from these issues, the game shines great and is amazing fun.

A classic...but a classic that seems unfinished and deserving of the rating it recieved on many other review sites such as IGN, Gamespot, Gamespy, and Joystiq. The game while massively fun has a lot of problems.  Let's start with the gameplay. The gameplay is anything but bad. It is fun. A heck of a lot of fun. There are two teams who are pitted against each other in a classic conquest style FPS game format. The teams must either eliminate all the other teams reinforcements, or capture all the control points. It is very fast paced and chaotic. Much more chaotic than the first game. This time you can have up to 64 bots in a match unlike the previous game, making for an exhilarating experience.   Now we get to the campaign. I guess it isn't bad but it isn't anything to be overjoyed about. Basically the campaign has you playing as the 501st Legion throughout the first 6 episodes of Star Wars. The thing is though is the maps and general objectives are the same as the multiplayer. Doesn't sound like too much fun does it. Now tack on some stupid (no not stupid, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) bots. Seriously, they act ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. You basically will end up doing all the work. I had 300 points during one round while the best bot on my team had only 16 STINKING POINTS! What the heck! Now that is just dumb. I am being nice by not mentioning the enemy team. Your probably wondering by now why I said 'I guess it isn't bad' at the beginning of this paragraph. The reason I said that is because I couldn't think of a better way to do it. That was probably the best campaign they could pull off in terms of story and gameplay.   Ok, time to talk about the graphics. They are terrible. Just terrible. I maxed the game out including anti-aliasing and it looked like junk. I felt like I was playing on a PS2. Now I know that this game is old and a 'sort of' port from the console versions, but still. You think they could've added some more graphical polish for the PC version.   The sound is clear, and crisp. The music and voice-over work feels believable and very Star Wars like. There was an issue with the 'Stereo Mix' and microphone that kept causing the game to crash but thankfully I fixed it. The Star Wars music is a nice touch too.  The game will last and you will get many hours out of it. The only concern is that Gamespy is shutting down at the end of May so you will have to use a third party application or addon, to play online (not the bots pleaaasssseee!)

Also to add onto the awesomeness known as Battlefront II is the Galactic Conquest, which kind of makes you feel like a general actually commanding, for example, the Empire's armies. If you read a bad report, the person who made that report has no idea what a game with some good work put into it looks like. Only problem is the graphics. They're O.K, but not great. I could go super in depth in everything good about this game like space battle which is the newest addition to the Battlefront series. I stand and applaud LucasArts and Pandemic for pulling off the single greatest space flight simulation game ever. The online play is fantastic and makes up for the mediocre enemy AI found in the single-player missions. I could sit here all day rambling on this game but i'm just going to leave it at this and say you should try out this game at least some time in your life if you are a Star Wars fan.",

It's very unfortunate the Gamespy will be shutting its doors, and that Multiplayer may shut down as well, but singleplayer is still an exciting experience. You can set major battles across many maps, on land and on space. You can imagine your war as you want, and bring in some of your favorite characters from the story, and do campaign to go into the story and even see things not in the movies or comics. What I love most about this game would have to be Galactic Conquest. It's basically a war to control all planets in the galaxy of Star Wars' setting, with both groups of pro/antagonists - Droids, Clones, Empire, or Republic. This game is insane fun, and I reccomend it with no doubt.",

            "review_text": "Possibly the best and the most enjoyable non-RPG Star Wars game made. Although mainly a FPS almost identical to the Battlefield series in the terms of the amount of reserves, but in this game there are also dogfight space battles and more, and also a more tactical game mode where you are to conquer the galaxy. The campaign is of a good length and covers the II-IV parts of the series, however you are able to play on any other planet that was mentioned in the series. The multiplayer is really fun, especially the Mos Eisley map where there is an option that every player is a special character. These include all the famous characters such as jedis, which are more powerful then the ordinary footsoldiers you get to play as in the singleplayer campaign. There are also bunch of other mods for these custom missions. The game is very fun to play with your friends, however the PC version does not include split-screen which is a shame, so you and your friends will have to play it online. The graphics are still good, although aged, unless you are a whiney Crysis kid who values the game by its visual aspects only. If that is the case then this game might not be for you. However if you are not and decide to get it, you will be suprised that the game still looks nice, but that isn't why you bought it then. Some people might also find the game hard to play, since it can get pretty difficult, especially in the later levels.  The bad parts of the game is that there are some issues with newer versions of Windows, and that you might wait a couple of days before getting your CD key, since Disney shut down the magnificient LucasArts and we all know what Disney is about now : $$$ The story is linear, and so are the objectives that are mainly to capture an objective or to defend a position while killing the enemy, but the combat is fun and the missions are interesting. Also the bad part is that there arent plenty of multiplayer servers (currently about 50) so you don't have quite a big choce, and most of them are filled with veterans who will dominate you over and over again, but when you are playing with friends you will probably host the game.  I have played this game since it came out, and I have finished the singleplayer many times. If you have the amount of money it costs and you don't mind slightly outdated graphics, then immediately purchase this game and you won't regret it.",

This is THE star wars game (If you're looking for the infantry viewpoint) to play. Graphics and animation are par for the course (if not better) from the ps2 era of games. The sound design is wonderful, blasters and lightsabers sound the way they should. Though, the original cast didn't make a return to voice the hero/villians (Mark Hammil, Harrison Ford etc). The story is wonderful, the telling of the republics fall to the empire and retelling the story from episode 3 and the story arc ends at the battle of hoth. There is also galactic conquest, a board game type play style where the objective is to capture planets and establish a hold over the galaxy. Then comes the meat of this games replayable nature, instant action. This is the 'free play' mode of the game, being able to play on every planet, with every game mode (Conquest, 2 and 1 flag ctf, hunt, and my favorite hero assault). The space battles, abeit limited are very good and no star wars game since has made casual dogfighting as much fun as this. All in all, this game is a must buy if you are a star wars fan (like myself :3) Despite the missing multiplayer component, it is still great fun to play. This is a great game.",

It is a tad bit on the aged side, but like a fine wine, that is not nessesarily a bad thing.  The single-player is interesting. The 'story mode' may not be the best single-player expirience ever offered, but it still is enjoyable. The main draws of this game are the 'Galactic Conquest' and 'Instant Action' modes. Both allow for hours of gameplay, and they both are worth returning to multiple times.  The controls are slightly awkward when a gamepad is attached (I still have not figured out if it is possible to use macros on my controller), but the keyboard and mouse controls are more or less intuitive.  The multiplayer expirience was out of this world (excuse the pun), and it is a real shame that it has been mostly removed. Thankfully, LAN battles are still completely functional, and with some help from external tools, mutli-network multiplayer is still possible.  Overall, the computer version does its console brothers justice.",

I wont spend too much time rabbiting on about the games features as its probably been done to death in other reviews. Its FPS. Its got 25 maps for instant action. Theres a decent campaign. Theres a galactic conquest where you manage a factions expansion over the galaxy. You can play in space and on the ground and for a 2005 game it was leagues ahead of competition. There are capture the flag modes and my favourite is the hunt - where you can run around in Endor and Naboo and just shoot the hell out of every ewok and gungan you see.  To anyone who had played this game back in the good old days there are 2 things that are left out of this pc version. Heroes V Villains and multiplayer galactic conquest so you cant sit down with a friend and argue about who gets to play as boba fett anymore.  Lastly i will compare this game to the recent star wars EA battlefront game that came out.  Galactic conquest - BF2 YES. EA-NO Decent campaign and single player alternative - BF2 YES. EA-NO Lots of playable heroes. - BF2 16. EA-6 DLC the bane of gamers life - BF2 Hell no. EA- hahahaha its EA of course there is.....suckers nostalgia - BF2 yes. EA-yeah the game kinda failed and will turn into Evolve or Battlefront hardline in a year. value for money - BF2 you can buy this game and get Just Cause 3. EA - enjoy debt  In summary this game is awesome and worth it and you can take your frustration about how rubbish the movie prequels were out on the gungan population.

Just buy the mother♥♥♥♥ing good one!  For anybody who hasn't caught on yet, (If so, I'm disappointed in you; you're a PC gamer, you should know better.)

Don't like those pesky auto turret defences slowly chiping away at your Y-Wing during a bombing run? Pop inside and sabotage the Auto Defence Mainframe. + Actual Classes to play as with fairly balanced weapons for the most part. *cough*bothanspy*cough* + Not made by EA.

I remember playing it on the PS2, but got annoyed because my PS2 game was very laggy in the menu. However when I got in-game the game worked great it was just the menu was so laggy it took forever just to select all the maps I wanted.  Issues: The game is old and you may dislike how the game functions. Two technical issues I encountered include: 1. I would get my game set up for me to play. And as soon as it loads my game it crashes. 2. The mouse doesn't work in-game, it works in the menu, but not in-game. People have mentioned the use of controllers. However I got this to see how it would be like to play with a keyboard and mouse.  Story: I haven't played through the campaign yet, the reason I didn't on the PS2 was because of how laggy my game was and because some maps didn't work.  Technical Issue 1(Fixed): For those of you experiencing immediate game crashes just as you're about to enter game, go to your sound recording settings and turn on your 'Stereo Mix' setting. This should fix your problem. If you don't have Windows 8, ask me and I'll try to find a solution to your problem, if I can.  Technical Issue 2(Fixed): I forgot to make sure my mouse X and Y-axis controls were set.  Note: I would recommend this game for those who have played it before, just to bring back memories.  If you have any questions, ask me and I'll answer them as best as I can.",

This is just a small list of the amazingly fantastic games that Battlefront 2 should be associated with. Whether being played on a console or a computer this game is a classic. Such an improvement from the original, and in comparison, very basic first Battlefront game with the introduction of the space battles, greater range of infantry based roles and the playable Heroes and Villians.   The gameplay is smooth and flowing, through the 50+ hours spent playing this PC version (and the uncountable number spent playing the console version) never once has this game crashed or bugged out.   The controls are simple (point and shoot - well point and clicking the left mouse button) and easy to pick up; in no time you can go from runing head strong into the heat of battle, disabling droids as you go on the dry desert world of Genosis, to piloting a Tie Interceptor and blowing up Rebel scum in a battle above the barren ice world of Hoth!   The single-player campaign following in the footsteps of the brave men of the 501st legion is a fantastic part of this game. It fully immerses you into the Star Wars story as you play through missions based on the events from Episode III through to Episode V. Only slight downside to these missions is that they seem slightly too short for my personal taste, but a very small fly in the ointment.  This game is simply incredible! I do believe that the new Star Wars Battlefront game, being released later this year (November I think) will have to be quite something to out do its predecessor. The bar is exceptionally high.  Would I recommend this game to anyone? I don't think I even have to write my answer, do you?",

A period that showcased the fall of the Galactic Republic, Featuring the Republic and the Separatists.    - -The Republic- An ancient and stagnate Beauracracy and the single largest form of Government in the Galaxy, which despite this relies almost exclusively on Clone Soldiers breed for battle, Whom are not given a choice.

Far more humanitarian in its use of Droids as opposed to the Republic's 'Green' solution of using clones.
