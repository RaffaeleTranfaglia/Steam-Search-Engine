            "review_text": "Today i review steam game Chopper: Lethal darkness. Genre arcade-shooter. We control the helicopter, and our mission is to kill enemies and complete the level.\\ Very simple gameplay and i think good time killer. In my opinion game the game is not suitable lovers violent shooters, probably lovers consoles dendy, sega or just old school players. There are features of the game: - A limited amount of ammunition - The opportunity to choose armed helicopter - Enemies have camps and ammunition depots, trucks, commercial vehicles, off-road vehicles with heavy machine guns and infantry. - As you progress in the game, our rank increases, and becomes available more weapons. We also have access to new, more complex areas. On my point graphic on game like 8-16bit, sounds are bad, gameplay easy and for all i give 6/10. Thanks for reading my review. ",

            "review_text": "game's definitely inspired by war in siria, as its shown on tv - all these big booms recorded via FLIR. i've never played a game with this approach before, so for me this one definitely stands out - number of missiles and bullets is limited to a quantity of a real helicopter - so you don't have never-ending stock, like in most games; overall - interesting - i recommend it",
