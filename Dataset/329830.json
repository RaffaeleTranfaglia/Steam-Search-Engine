            "review_text": "What a unique game! Basically all you do in this game is walk around and try to not only figure out what happened on this island, but who exactly you are. If you are a bit patient and observant, you can answer both of those questions. You can click on items and notes to read them or initiate text to pop up. There’s a fair amount of reading. There are also a few minor puzzles to solve which involve just searching carefully.   The flashlight mechanic is a bit of a nuisance because you have to keep recharging it to keep it lit, but I think the devs really wanted you to feel a sense of impending dread. The darkness does feel oppressive and the more you know about the story, the more your sense of dread will build.   You can beat the whole game in about an hour, and it's meant to be played that way. Be prepared for a fantastic ending too! All in all, a very unique and tense experience. ",

The Moon Sliver doesn't just dump narration on you to make up for how little the world communicates to you through what you can see -- it dumps it in a messy way, plopping big blocks of text on screen in whatever order you happen to come across the prompts. Are you looking at two text-prompt hotspots at once? Enjoy your big overlapping blocks of now unreadable text.   And somehow, despite getting your HUD bombed with pages and pages of narration, you're probably still not going to have any idea what's going on or why you should have sympathy for these characters. For all the words it uses to tell you the story, it ends up telling very little.",

            "review_text": "The Moon Sliver is one of those 'visual novels' or 'interactive stories', so it's not a game. And there are two more heads-ups here: - it's very short, 30 to 40 minutes, so it's more of a short story than a novel; - the interactivity is pretty limited. I wanted to elaborate a bit on that but then I considered that might be a spoiler so I decided against it.  The story presented here is pretty basic stuff. It's also told in a peculiar way, but I suppose that's due to translation issues rather than intended. The graphics are ok for the purpose they serve, but they are certainly not impressive in a way that they would improve upon the story or the overall experience.  I went back and forth between recommending The Moon Sliver or not, but in the end I went with 'No' because of the following facts: 1. What you're getting here is a very short story/experience, and not an overly impressive one at that. 'It's ok' is the most enthousiastic phrase that comes to mind, really. 2. Only when it's on sale for less than 50 cents could one consider recommending The Moon Sliver. At its full price it's definitely a 'No Way'! 3. Yes, the game has Steam Trading Cards but it's too short for that. When you\\'re finished, you will usually have received one of three cards. This means everyone needs to let the game run idly in the background for at least an hour to get the other cards.",

            "review_text": "I've seen The Moon Sliver compared to Dear Esther, and while it's not quite in that company, for reasons we'll get to later, it's not a bad explanation of what the game is. An interactive narrative, a stroll-em-up, a walking simulator, whatever, the point is that it's atmospheric and tells a more than competent story.   The Moon Sliver takes a novel approach to its story telling. You enter the world not knowing anything about what's going on, but it soon becomes apparent that you're on a small, doomed island and the population have disappeared. As you explore the handful of abandoned buildings you'll discover paraphernalia that you can click on, filling part of the screen with text. As you move around the room the text will fade being replaced with new text you've discovered. The story is deliberately vague, but by walking around the room in the right way you can at least piece together the order it's supposed to be read in.   Apart from one, arguably 2 puzzles, the only other gameplay mechanic is your torch, which has the battery life of a Game Gear. You have to keep charging it at one of the outlets otherwise it will flicker and die. You need the torch to see where you're going, and yes, the repeated need to charge it does its job of adding tension, but it feels a little cheap.   Graphics don't make a game, or they shouldn't, but there's no denying they can help. The Moon Sliver isn't an expensive game, it wasn't made by a big team, so that it isn't jaw dropping is both understandable and forgivable, but it is to its detriment. The game looks desolate, as it's supposed to, but not always in a good way. Buildings look simplistic, the barren plains a little too barren, and interiors are almost completely empty. There’s little in the way of texture work, the same features are repeated, and environmental effects are limited. Dear Esther worked largely because it looked cold, empty and uninhabited, the evocative moments punched harder because they looked so picturesque. It may be unfair to compare to two, but Dear Esther is indicative of where The Moon Sliver doesn’t work, it doesn’t convince you of its world, it doesn’t take you there.  Still though it does tell a good story, and despite all the odds it The Moon Sliver does get tense. The uncertainty and the change of environment, it works, and it’s all set up by the narrative. The music doesn’t quite flow as smoothly as it should, you can hear the moment it clicks back to the start, but it’s tonally perfect, foreboding. The Moon Sliver is worth your time, and it’s cheap enough that it’s probably worth the gamble if you fancy a narrative experience. You do get the feeling that if the developer (David Szymanski) took another stab at this in another couple of years (or his previous game, the surprising and dark Fingerbones) they’d see a huge improvement, but what’s there is still a game that stayed in my thoughts for a few days ",

            "review_text": "Ignore the budget price and the rather pretty screenshots - this is a rather badly designed, rushed looking experience. Everything has been sloppily cobbled together in Unity. Lazy models are constantly reused. The 'puzzles' are unsatisfying and trite (key right next to a locked chest? really?). The labyrinthine storage section is frustrating and ugly to look at.  With a good narrative this might have been salvaged, but unfortunately it doesn't have the same writing quality of superior games like Ether One or A Machine for Pigs. The fragmented narrative can get frustrating to deal with and the characters aren't really well-developed enough to hold any emotional investment. The premise was interesting enough to hold my attention, though.  I honestly hate writing negative reviews for one-man indie games but this was just too lazily put together to ignore. With more care and effort I could have been swayed, but for now I can't recommend experiencing this.   (I did enjoy the soundtrack though. Sound design was definitely one of the better elements of the game)",

The game is 30 minutes of short vignettes that recount the thoughts and conversations of people who existed on this island. Over the course of the game you'll wander around and discover what befell the people that lived there. The story is easy enough to follow (there is some blank filling required on the player's side) and interesting enough to keep you hooked for the whole 30 or so minutes of 'gameplay.'  So, gameplay. It's... there. You can interact with a few objects to bring up a small text box that gives additional context/story, and occasionally you can pick up an item.  It's exceptionally barebones. If you hate walking sims you will despise this. If you enjoy unique indie game aesthetics you'll probably enjoy this one.  Pros:   A nice story   Good atmosphere   Good music   Cons:   A large number of text prompts are all proximity based and can overlap... yeah. Not very good.   A poor sense of direction. Not that there's none at all (landmarks and power pylons do an okay job), but finding out what is interactive and what isn't requires you to stumble your mouse around until the cursor changes in most cases. Sometimes a lone book can be used. Sometimes it cant. Etc. Needed more coherent visual rules.   The flashlight requiring a recharge felt... unnecessary from a gameplay perspective.   ",

It's very short, lasting only about an hour, and the gameplay only involves walking around and looking at objects for hints of the story taking place. As for horror, its very psychological, but if jumpscares are your thing, this isn't for you either.  If this description doesn't turn you off though, what I will say is that what this game sets out to do, it does brilliantly. It causes serious fear, even when nothings happening, because you're so uncomfortable with your surroundings. The story is shattered and disjointed, but gripping, making you want to fit the pieces together to try and figure out what's actually going on. The graphics aren't the most detailed, but this is a positive too as I feel it helps the mood more than realistic graphics ever could.  I really recommend trying this if it sounds like a game you're interested in. It's an amazing experience, one a review can't quite give justice.",

I'm a huge fan of 'don't ask me about the game, just play it' and love the unexpected. If you are likeminded, its definately worth picking up The Moon Sliver.   The graphics aren't incredible and the controls are very simple, but that all adds to the charm, and to a certain extent, the creeepiness of the game. The Moon Sliver is saying more through less as its the lack of entities that make it such a chilling piece of work. I'm unsure as to whether this is as a result of a lack of time or resources from the author, or whether this was intended to be so, but either way it works terrifically well.   As you can see, it took me roughly an hour to complete the game. I have more to say about playing The Moon Sliver after 60 minutes, than I do about some horror games that I have invested 10 hours into. If you appreciate story, atmosphere and more subtle horror then you'll get your monies worth out of this short and sweet experience.",

After finishing the game, it felt like some of the connections in the story pieces were flimsy and could have been executed better with more detail and explicit threading.

However, I found its way of telling said story to be a mash-up of confusion and misguidance. From numerous problems such as a lack of an actual map for the plain, repetitive landscape, to a very misleading way of pushing you from one part of the story to the next... I can't say I was too satisfied.  For starters, the story is told in the form of captions appearing and filling up a majority of the screen as you try to look around and examine your environment. The captions are as quick to appear as they are to disappear as you make your way through the world, forcing you to stop walking so you can read a novel that takes up your screen before taking a few more steps to encounter the same problem, since moving to different areas toggles different pieces of the story to pop up. You find yourself playing a game of 'Have I Already Read That?' as you manuever through the game with little to no helpful landmarks to tell you where you are or where you have to go. Also, as you progress, the sky becomes extemely dark and using your limited flashlight doesn't help you much in the worsening weather. Good luck finding anything, you'll be wandering for a while.  To not make this review a complete rant, I will say that... I did like the story. It could have been told in a much better way, mind you, but it was entriguing and mysterious.

The story, such as it is, shares a similarity with the Music Machine, in that the story just hangs in a vacuum, without any anchoring... there's little explanation of how the 'setup' was achieved, only that a certain set of things are happening, and you're just to get on with the story from there, and not ask anything inconvenient like 'Ok, so how did they get there in the first place..'   The level design is simplistic, and uses a lot of stock textures. The story was a bit haphazard, and if you missed some bits by not exploring the 'right bits' of the island before nightfall, you're S*** outta luck piecing it together!  The sounds were fair, using a few stock SFX I think. The sounds in the 'tunnels' was really good, and some of the music snippets above-ground were fair too ...  I'd give this a 'meh'.

This time the story is less smooth and much more difficult to interpretate, compared to music machine and Fingerbones.  I liked all of the adventures, and this one gave me literally chills towards the end. I guess now it is the turn of 'A wolf in Autumn' which I didn't even notice was released :)  Thanks also for the awesome prices....many indie developers just put crazy prices on their work, I find that 2 euros is the perfect price for such a short but deep adventure.",

Find more places (and 3 keys or some) and you'll progress through the story.  The thing with Dear Esther that made it fail so hard was its lack of interactivity, making me just not care about it. If you make a story-game make sure you get the player fully involved.  The Moon Sliver tries to add exploration and interactivity-elements to it, however it still felt tacked on in favor of telling the story. Let's be honest using a flashlight is just a way in helping to find more places, more storybits.  The low quality textures/polygones are quite ok for the horror genre. This game has a good alienating atmosphere because of this.   I can't recommend it though. Maybe the story was enough for some to make a recommendation, but I didn't really much care when I finished the game.",

            "review_text": " The Moon Silver  is a walking simulator game with a story. It's not even a game at all, since you're just technically reading a story itself. The storyline can get quite confusing since it's not linear. In other words, you can freely proceed to the 'wrong' area and get the story messed up. Moreover, people have different interpretations on their own. The story is not narrative nor clear.   Graphics  seemed okay in proportion to its file size. Simple enough to be understood and seen properly. The scenarios will definitely set the tone. Barren lands and post-apocalyptic elements give you the feeling of desolation, desperation, and loneliness. Just what the mood of the game is all about.  The  Audio  and the music sounds a little bit off for me. Yes, it sets the tone and the ambiance of the story but it's a source of distraction. They also have scenes with dead air which is not totally needed. I'm actually expecting something big to happen during the dead air. Unfortunately, you just have to read again. Overall, I think the music needs a rework.  The flashlight mechanic is somewhat annoying. You must head to an outlet everytime you ran out of batteries. The element is not really needed since it's just a waste of time and doesn't even connect to the story.  If you're asking, 'Is it worth the $2.99?'  I say NO. It's better to read an online novel rather than to purchase this game; or support your local authors by buying their tangible books. To be honest, I got this game for FREE on Holiday 2014 Christmas Auction and it didn't cost me anything at all, just a thousand Steam gems to grab a copy of the game.  I got overwhelmed when I got this game. This game was already in my wishlist on September 2014. My expectations were so high. But none met my expectations, so I ended up getting disappointed badly.  Rating:  2/10   Disclaimer: Everything is purely based on my opinion. Thanks for reading!~",

I explored like crazy to get every scrap of information I could find and it left me wanting. It was obviously just someone's learning experience.

            "review_text": "The Moon Sliver is the game that introduced me to David Szymanski, a bearded indie dev who lives in a house filled with his four cats, one dog and lovely wife.  It all started with a message about how much I liked The Moon Sliver and now about six months later we're (kind of) buddies and blabber about all sorts of stuff. (and maybe even play videogames if he's not busy :D)  So now, ten months later I suddenly started thinking about writing reviews on his games. I felt like that would be the least I could do as I highly respect him and like to help him out as much as I can. So now that this intoduction is over, I'll stop writing my letter to David and start actually talking about the game. :D   The Moon Sliver takes place on a dying island. Four people live there. They have to trust eachother, help eachother and listen to eachother to make sure that they'll keep their minds off the horrible, depressing and sad thoughts that they keep in the darkest corners of their minds. Smiles can be wonderful masks you know...  ...Oh yeah, that's all I'll say about the story, I've already spoiled more than I should about this fantastic little game.  But, I guess I COULD tell you a little bit more about the game.  First off, this game is NOT for people who do not enjoy reading in videogames. Second off, this game is NOT for people who enjoy having their poo poo come out of their butt when Freddy Fazeclanbear or whatever he's called shows up on your screen, screaming his throat out. This game has NO jumpscares! (and it feels so ♥♥♥♥ing good to say that ooohh yeaaa) Third off(?), did I mention that this game has no jumpscares?  'But what tha heck do ya do this this computer gaime??' Well, I'll sure tell you, you...Cool person that says computer game instead of videogame!  You walk around a dying island, unveiling and piecing together the fragments that explain what happened to the island, the people who lived there and even how the island came to be. (That's the WRONG game, ooooooooo)  Yeah, that's actually what you do in the game, but I love it and if you don't like the sound of that then why don't I get this totally real quote from David Szymanski himself to tell you how cool it is. 'Hey, I'm the real David Szymanski and Derp's totally right, my game is the coolest, even my dog plays it. Also, Derp is really cool and has big muscles and all the women like him and are all over that man for real. Also this quote is real.' See? Told you it's a cool game. ... Such a nice man.  Uhm, anyways, what else is there...Hmm...MUSIC! Yes, music! The music isn't too big of a deal honestly, but it truly does bring out a great atmosphere so it does it's job. David made it and you can actually buy the soundtrack here on steam which I did so throw a few smackarooines at him if you feel like listening to that music.  VISUALS!! The visuals in The Moon Sliver has been a little issue with some of the players of The Moon Sliver. Now, let me just say...What the ♥♥♥♥? The visuals of The Moon Sliver was my favorite part of the game, it's what sparked my interest among a few other things when I watched the trailer for it. (originally I thought that the game took place in a prison in a desert but apparently not XP) Basically, I find the negative judging of the visuals of The Moon Sliver highly offensive towards my artist side. To anyone who liked them, you know what's up. B)  And that's all I'd like to say about The Moon Sliver. A great little game with barely any flaws that I can think of. So, now I'd like to say thank you David Szymanski for responding to my long message that one time in march, now I'm off to do whatever. Byeeee!",

However, that was before I decided to take the effort to really read the text, really try to understand. If you take your time with it and mentally put together the whole story as it travels from place to place on the small island, it becomes very interesting.

It is full of intrigue, mystery, subtlety and suspense. I prefer this type of horror to the in-your-face style of Dead Space or similar titles. You should play this alone, and in the dark. It is masterfully crafted and artistically gorgeous to look at (despite being on Unity). The soundtrack fits the mood really well.  To get an idea of how the game plays and how the story works, check out the developers free game, Fingerbones, which is now on Steam. It takes less than 20 minutes to play and left me with chills.

The story, despite being slightly hard to follow at times, was what made the game special. A lot of games these days focus on revolutionizing game mechanics or graphics, but this game helps to remind me that you don't need great graphics or new mechanics to create a good game.
