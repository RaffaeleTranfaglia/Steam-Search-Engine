Camera system is excellent.  exploration value is great.you wander around, you find tomb and lotta salvage.tons of level variation. sniping from tree tops@ night,creepy caverns, shipwreck beach..  best survial-adventure-action game. deaths are spectacular.  even if you die all your collectibles and stuff you got are saved.     Bad:   Mini games/quick time events- (like when enemy attacks you) are unfair and feel unpolished. you have to quickly press the buttons but there's not enough time to read it and you die. I had to do some of these 5-6 times in a row before I can understand wtf I am actually supposed to do. dying this way gets on the nerves real fast.  Multiplayer- not a single server. played only 4 times. the maximum number of players I found in match is 6. mechanics and unlocking sysem is good enough, fun when you can find the players.  cover system and stealth mechanics could have been better.

            "review_text": "Until this game I had never played an action-adventure. When I first discovered Tomb Raider, I was so enthralled that I played it three times back-to-back, only stopping because my backlog was crying.   The first thing I noticed were the gorgeous graphics. There are tiny details everywhere, from incidental carvings that you'll only see for a moment, to the way Lara shivers in the cold, or the way her arms shake with exertion when she lifts something heavy. The cutscenes are beautifully-directed, and add much to the story. The voices, music, and sound effects are superb, and every aspect of this game weaves together to form a stunning and vibrant tapestry. EVERYTHING is beautiful, even the ugly things.   Gameplay  is multi-faceted, and you can tailor it to your preferred style. Want to face your enemies head-on, Rambo-style? You can do that! Prefer to explore and learn everything about this island and its inhabitants? You can do that, too! My personal preference is option #2 with a healthy dose of I-Am-The-Night stealth and silently removing enemies before they know I'm there.   Collectibles  are many, ranging from relics, treasure maps, and journals to area-specific quests blowing up old sea mines. I am a completionist, and one who loves finding every last scrap of story and information in a game, but there is an incentive to find everything possible, even for the Rambo-types... Experience and Salvage.   Experience  nets you Skill Points, which are used to upgrade Skills: Survivor, Hunter, and Brawler. I won't bore you with the list of possible upgrades, but here's an example of each: Increased Exp when looting, Increased ammo capacity, Dodge skills    Salvage  allows you upgrade your various weapons: Bow, Pistol, Rifle, and Shotgun. You'll even find weapon parts if you look hard enough, which increases the power of your weapons even more!  The  treasure maps  will show all of the items that will get you to 100% completion on the game, but do NOT show quest items, ammo, orange plants, or salvage, all of which will also add to your Exp &amp; Salvage totals. Another great way to earn both is by hunting and looting, especially if you go for those headshots I mentioned earlier. (Bonus experience; ka-CHING!)  Want those treasure maps? The secret tombs are where you'll find them. These tombs are pretty hard to miss, since you'll hear a chime play whenever you get close to them. Raiding a tomb consists of puzzling out how to get to the payoff (large chest, ho!), and generally take about 10 minutes each to complete. They're a great addition to the game, and the experience bonus is a GREAT incentive to go exploring!  Throughout your travels you'll find  campfires , which serve as extra saves points (the game auto-saves), and will also allow you to apply the skill points you've earned and to spend your salvage on upgrades. They also serve as ' fast travel ' points, and will allow you to transport to different areas of the map instantly. Be aware that fast travel is not always available, depending on where you are in the story.  There are intermittent  Quicktime Events  that will require you to... well, to survive. lol~ If you're dexterity-challenged such as myself, I recommend sticking with it -- It's absolutely worth the many times you'll end up dying. ;)  There are  50 achievements  available, 15 of which are for multi-player  Extras  include Concept Art (too many to count!) and 18 Character Models  In closing, to me Tomb Raider 2013 is well-nigh the perfect game, blending all of my favorite elements with a hefty dose of knuckle-whitening action, and leaving me with nothing but a feeling of total satisfaction. I cannot stress enough how good this game is, so what are you waiting for? PLAY IT NOW!!  Read the FULL REVIEW  HERE  [genkisgamegab.forumotion.com] ",

            "review_text": "I bought this game back in 2014, when there was a steam summer sale. This one was a quite intersting game. The story takes place on a japanese island called Yamatai whcih was ruled by Himiko. When the Endurance ship came close to the island, it was suddenly attacked by a storm. The survivals of the Endurance crew are fighting for survival just like Lara Croft who becomes a hardened survivor during the gameplay. I found the game graphics very nice. The single player experience was good for me. Some game crashes, bugs and glitches still exists, but not too many game crashes. It includes a wide variety of weapons including bows, assault rifles, shotguns and pistols. During the gameplay at basecamps Lara can upgrade her skills and weapons. Weapons can be upgraded with either salvages or weapon parts that are scattered across Yamatai. For faster skill upgrades you Lara must kill enemys with headsots that gives more XP points than regular kills. The multiplayer experience was worse than the single player. Multiplayer part of the game is full with bugs and crashes. Most of the the time game lags due to P2P connection. 5 maps come with multiplayer as a default. Of course map numbers can be increased, if you buy DLC maps that are either come as a DLC or if you buy the Game of the Year Edition. Weapons and characters can be purchased with salvages which can be collected during the match. There are 2 factions. The Survivors and the Solarii. Both factions have advantages and disadvanatges. In general I found this game very good, however it does not remind me about older Tomb Raider games like Tomb Raider I, II, III. The early Tomb Raider games were much harder than Tomb Raider 2013. Mainly because of solving hard puzzles without help. This game features only a few puzzles which are not hard to solve, cause objects are highlighted if you don't know how to solve it. Game can be finished in a couple of hours. If you are looking for a challenge buy the very early Tomb Raider games, which are the classic ones and takes more time to finish. In general this game worths a try.",

The single player is more of a story/survival oriented part of the game. Youre following Lara through her battle for life and and attempt to save her 'friends' . The story itself is unique but some of the characters may seem a little bit cliche. 2. Multiplayer- the multiplayer is fun,the content is great considering the fact that this was originally a exclusively single player game. The characters are ok,the combat is fine. The biggest downfall to it would be the connection which is peer2peer so there might be some occasional lag and the unbalance between player levels and teams.   10/10",

            "review_text": "I don't know. It's a solid game with some stunning visuals and they sure did a good job when modelling and animating Lara, she really looked cool and felt great to control, but that is basically all that stands out. The story is mediocre, at times pretty cheesy, the characters are stereotypes - with Lara being no real exception - and this game is barely anything I remember from my older Tomb Raider times. You fight people mostly, the action is ok but wasn't very challenging on normal difficulty. There is some platforming, but not that much, none of it being really difficult anyway, and the puzzling at it's 'heights' requires you only to pull or push a thing or two within a rather easily doable time limit. The optional 'tombs' are a joke - slightly bigger caves at best that you can do in a very few minutes only to get some 'salvage' you don't really need anyway (see below).  I've heard people call the game a reboot of the series. They are clearly moving away from their roots. That isn't necessarily bad if one can enjoy dozens of quicktime events and narrowly directed gameplay paths and cutscenes in chliché manner (everything Lara climbs breaks, every path she goes soon or later goes up in flames - it's a very predictable manner and was overused in Uncharted as well). I just wish the game had more unique aspects. It felt like a watered down cinematic action title and a very drastic Uncharted clone. Which is kind of funny because Uncharted was called a Tomb Raider clone in the beginning. Funny how things can turn around.  The game has an XP system and a multiplayer. I don't know. Do they wanted to do it? Is Square Enix pushing them? It doesn't seem very fitting. You upgrade your mostly combat-related skills and weapons through the XP system and through 'salvage' which basically serves as money. But if the combat is already easy enough there isn't any need to do that unlike you are a completionist, which I am not by nature. I've only played one multiplayer match thus far, and it looks mediocre too. It's PvP only. Pretty sad. After I was done with Uncharted the online co-op of it made me stick around a lot longer. Tomb Raider lacks that, and since the PvP doesn't look too appealing I will probably not stick around much longer with this game. I'm glad I got it pretty cheap during some sale. And even though I might check out the previous installments - my last one before this reboot title was Tomb Raider 4 - I will be very careful about the next installment in the series.",

The combat was fun and the puzzles were not easy but I never felt super challenged. The quick time events were unusually tough, but that was probably me. I did bug Lara out freezing her in midair after jumping off a ledge and she also 't-posed' during combat once. Both problems were fixed by reloading the checkpoint.  The graphics were nice, being good even though the game came out in 2013. The soundtrack was great and fit into the game world well.  The story was interesting and unique leaving me hungry for the sequel. The game progresses as fast as you do and no matter where you are in the story you can fast travel at the base camps, except when   you are at the geothermal caverns for the first time   and   at the very end of the game  .  This is the first Tomb Raider game I have ever played and I love it. It is very unique and most of the areas are quite beautiful.  It takes 18-20 hours to beat the campaign and I would rate it a 9/10.",

            "review_text": "You can always tell a series has been rebooted when the numbers and subtitles disappear. Crystal Dynamics latest entry is simply called Tomb Raider, placing a very young Lara Croft in the spotlight. This is not the seasoned veteran with short-shorts and dual pistols. This is a fragile girl on her first big adventure. In the introduction, she makes a decision to head into the dangerous waters known as the Dragon’s Triangle, and her entire crew is shipwrecked on an island, fighting for their very survival.  Tomb Raider twists and turns through its narrative with an array of emotions. Lara starts off soft and caring - even apologetic - to enemies and animals when she first kills them. Over time though, she hardens and becomes more comfortable with what she has to do. This is where I felt things become disconnected. Lara never enjoys the mass murder she is committing, in fact she still acts hesitant until the end, but it never stops her from mowing down entire camps of enemies. It is a weird dichotomy that I only overcame by suspending my disbelief.  Outside of that, the story is told exceptionally well. I actually cared what happened to Lara, and her journey became my own. I felt that her growth over the course of the game was well told, though I wish the same narrative care were extended to the other characters. The central villain started off well, but was never fleshed out, and Lara’s crew was forgettable outside of Jonah, the ship’s cook, who I couldn’t help but really like.  What makes Tomb Raider so special is that it nails the most important part of gaming, the actual gameplay. Everything feels exactly the way it should. The combat is pure bliss; better than almost any other third-person shooter on the market. The platforming feels great, and I never had trouble traversing across chasms or up the side of cliffs. The controls simply fall into place on every level. Crystal Dynamics has fine-tuned every aspect of the game to feel just right, and their work has paid off.  The mixture of combat, platforming and puzzle solving has definitely shifted for this entry in the series. In previous installments, it was always more about exploration and platforming, but now the combat takes the driver’s seat. It is a bit disappointing that there aren’t more sequences of actual “tomb raiding”, but since the combat is so satisfying, it is hard to complain about it.  Aside from the combat, Lara has quite a few tricks up her sleeve. The bow and arrow are used to kill animals and defend against enemies. Outside of the tutorial, I found little use for hunting animals besides harvesting salvage and XP. Lara has a “survival instinct” enabled by tapping the left bumper to turn the screen monochrome, while also highlighting enemies, animals and items in the environment. It’s similar in application to Batman’s “detective vision.” Once upgraded, this makes finding collectibles almost too easy, removing some of the fun of stumbling across them.  What I did love was the Metroid-style progression the game delivers. Progression through the story unlocks additional gear that opens up new ways to explore the environment. For example, the rope arrow is used on specific wooden posts, creating pathways across chasms and into new areas. This continues throughout the duration of the game, and constantly drove my sense of exploration and excitement for new equipment.  Lara also now levels with a traditional XP and skill point system. Skill points can be used to purchase new abilities in three areas. The first is survival, and consists of letting you earn more XP and salvage from enemies and animals, as well as being able to see items using your survival vision. The second set of upgrades involves things like increased ammunition carrying capacity, while the last one focuses on combat and finishing moves. There are some truly brutal finishers Lara can execute.   The main game is a solid eight to ten hours if you skip out on a large portion of the collectibles, but there is certainly plenty that kept me coming back. The amount of collectibles in the game borders on excessive. Each area has a specific challenge like lighting statues or burning posters, and completion translates into XP. There are also GPS stashes, documents that detail the island’s history and, of course, relics.   Tomb Raider is one of those games that I couldn’t help but enjoy. It does so much so well, that I found myself completely immersed. It is only when I stepped back and looked at it from a logical standpoint that the cracks began to show. As I mentioned, the excessive killing feels contradictory to the Lara’s character. She frequently expresses remorse, even after slamming her pickaxe into an aggressor’s skull. The game is also linear, despite Crystal Dynamics’ efforts to evoke the feeling of open-world design.  A lot has been said about the fact that this Tomb Raider comes packaged with an online multiplayer mode, which is a first for the series. I want to stress that even if you never touch it, the game is still worth owning. The competitive modes are merely serviceable. There are traditional loadouts and perks like any other third-person online offering. The selection of maps is decent, and the fantastic shooting from the single player carries over. I just don’t see myself ever playing this online again.   Tomb Raider visuals are undeniably impressive. The game looks fabulous running on high settings. The textures on the characters look amazing, and the frame rate is rock solid nearly all the time. The new TressFX that creates realistic hair is cool to look at, but it created some truly awkward looks on Lara from time to time.This is certainly one amazing looking game, but it also sounds great. The score is brilliant, delivering that big-budget orchestral sound that accompanies a lot of Hollywood movies. Camilla Luddington does an outstanding job voicing Lara, and the rest of the cast compliments her extremely well. The effects are also top-notch when listened to through a solid setup.  Tomb Raider is an exceptionally well-made game that delivers yet another rebirth of a beloved series this year. It is always exciting to see old franchises that feel new again, and Crystal Dynamics has truly made Lara and her adventures their own. I am excited to see where they go from here, and hope they flesh out the survival aspect a bit more in the sequel. I would also love to see them bring back more of the unique puzzle designs featured in past games, but as a starting point, Tomb Raider is easily one of my favorite games of the year so far, and one I think deserves to be experienced by everyone. If you have a love for the series or third-person adventure games, this is a must play. Lara is back and better than ever.",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider is the reboot of the classic adventure games, but with a dark and gritty feel. Will you want to play this or go back to the originals ?  Tomb Raider follows on Lara Croft as she is on an expedition to find an Island called Yamatai which was once ruled by queen Himiko. The ship crashes on the island which is populated by crazy survivors who want the entire crew dead. So it's up to you to find a way of the island.   To begin this review I want to express something about this game. When it was first announced, I wasn't a major fan of the gritty and violent tone of the game. I felt that taking it too far would take away the charm the original game had. But after I had the chance to sit down and play it, I feel mixed on the game.  Now I'm not calling the game bad, I quite enjoyed it and found myself on the edge of my seat in some moments. But this game suffers from major problems which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming title Rise of the Tomb Raider.   The story is this games weakest point. You're supposed to root for the characters to get of the island and you want them all to stay alive. But apart from Lara i didn't care for anyone. All characters felt one dimensional and it was really hard to actually like any of them. You have stereotypical characters like the nerd, the tough old guy, the mentor and stuff like that. Not to mention the entire plot is incredibly predictable and you can see who dies from a mile away.  The gameplay is fun, but it feels more like a cover shooter than a mixture of both Adventure and Shooter game which the original game was. I felt the game focused way too much on the combat and not so much on puzzles. The game does have optional tombs that have puzzles in them so you can get the treasure, but it's incredibly easy to miss these tombs.   The game is also riddled with bugs and glitches. One time the game crashed because of an explosion I caused. Enemies phase through walls and you can glitch through walls too.   Graphics and the environments look absolutely beautiful and it's one of the best looking games I have ever played. Maxed out it's one pretty looking game.  The optional tombs are probably the best thing about this game. I loved the puzzles and the whole figuring out stuff even though it was incredibly easy.   Boss fights are another problem with this game. Most boss fights consist on how many shotgun shells can you blast in the shotgun face. Apart from one cool boss which took place up on a lift that's falling apart there's not much variety.  The entire game took me 10 hours to finish everything expect find all the collectibles. The game is overall pretty easy so you shouldn't have much trouble finishing it.   In the end this game tries too hard to be Uncharted with it's over the top action sequences. The game is still a really fun game and I would say it's worth buying just to play through it once. But expect more of an third person shooter and not a Puzzle driven adventure game with shooting involved.

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider is a fantastic action adventure game with beautiful and explosive (literally!) setpieces. There are many moments where her surrounding is falling apart while you are traversing it and this provides many tense moments in the game. Since this game is a reboot of the franchise, Lara Croft is reimagined as a young adventurer who gets trapped in an island full of dangerous cultists and throughout her journey she evolved from an innocent girl to a full fledged survivor who has no qualms about killing others for the sake of surviving and protecting her friends.   This game does include a cast of likeable and interesting side characters to compliment Lara Croft in this game. From the main antagonist who is willing to do anything to escape from the island to Lara Croft best friend Samantha who has a link to the island they are trapped in. Throughout Lara's journey you can see her changed visually as well, since her character model would looked more damaged as the game progresses such as her clothes slowly ripping off and the increasing number of injuries on her. The weapons in this game does evolved visually and stats wise as every upgrade you add into your weapons does reflect on the weapons itself. I have to complement them for these great attention to details!  For those who like collecting things, this game does have various collectables such as relics, gps caches and notes hidden throughout various levels. These collectables does give the player insights about the background and history of the island which is interesting and make the collection more worth the effort.  There is also multiplayer in this game, where you can play as a cast of different characters from the story. There are also different weapons and gadgets that you can use for this mode. However, there are barely anybody playing multiplayer at the time of this review. So the multiplayer in this game is pretty much dead. However the main catch of this game is in it's story mode which I found to be fantastic! I give this game a 9/10 and I would recommend this game to anyone who likes a great action adventure game and it is good to have more female protagonist in the male dominated protagonist scene.",

The game makes you feel her pain and her suffering as she is hardened in the wilds and in battle. It makes you feel so much compassion por her that you can't help but get yourself into the story.    The battles are really good, you can choose to either go full stealth with your arrows, or you can go full LEEROY JEEEEENKINSSS with your rifle and make it rain blood! (Yours probably).    But anyways, I find myself trying to collect everything and spending more time hunting in the forest than completing the storyline. (It is THAT beautiful). Recomend completely, no regrets.   10/10 Would totally buy again.",

            "review_text": "An excellent prequel to reboot the  Tomb Raider  series! Experience Lara Croft progressing from just your average girl to ultimate badass, and take a truck load of punishment in the process.  Action sequences &amp; storytelling are exceptional &amp; all blend perfectly with the gameplay. This kept pace pretty much for my entire 20hr playthrough, switching from more puzzle &amp; exploration locations to all out  'it's War!'  action sets. The puzzles aren't particularly difficult compared to previous  Tomb Raider  games.  There are some very clever game design direction too, like subtle commentary to give you guidance, use of selective camera angles &amp; forgiving map design &amp; controls  (&amp; check points)  minimising those frustrating moments. There are some light RPG elements in skill &amp; weapon upgrades allow you to set Lara up to suit your playstyle. I don't think this RPG element was really needed, but it doesn't hurt the game design.  Visual style is rich, highly detailed &amp; immersive.  Lara's overall persona &amp; attitude through her character animations &amp; audio commentary change over the course of her adventure, giving a good depth of emotion &amp; shows a lot of personality. This along with the good story results in you ending up caring for Lara trying to survive the danger strickened island. This improved emphasis on character &amp; story really sets the bar higher for the series &amp; sets it apart from many others in genre.  If I was picky, more variety in the baddies  (AI, skins, voices)  so they don't feel like an 80s B-grade action movie re-run, &amp; bit less  'Rambo'  levels &amp; more puzzles would have been perfect. Turning  Tomb Raider  into a 3rd person shooter is just not what these games are about to me. Also to this point, they could have given multiplayer a miss IMHO as it really doesn't fit  (nor plays very well) .  Other than these minor points,  Tomb Raider  was an awesomely enjoyable experience, both suited to the fans of the series as well as new comers.

            "review_text": "I came to the 2013 Tomb Raider reboot as someone who never really played the old Tomb Raider games. I'm not going to be comparing it to the old Tomb Raider games because: a) I feel I'm not at liberty to do so having never played them, and b) I believe that a reboot should stand on its own, seeing as how the goal of a reboot is to forge a new path. With that said...  Essentially I was drawn to it simply because of the premise: adventurer archaelogist girl crash-lands on an old mystical island and has to find a way to survive the experience, and get off the island.  The premise is indeed here, but it's sort of lost in the over indulgence of gore and survivor-torture. There were many points in the game where I was like, 'Okay, I get it, she's a tough survivor but holy crap! That fall really should have killed her, honestly!' And you'll have a lot of those moments, moments of 'oh...okay, not dead yet.' Now, the incredibly intense cinematics within this trope the game follows are honestly super impressive and one of my favorite aspects of the game. You'll have to run for your life to escape from a crumbling, burning building, dodge huge chunks of falling debris while hanging off the side of a mountain with only a pickaxe for stability, push a wolf off your leg before he gnaws it off - and the list goes on and on and on. While self-indulgent, these are the moments where Tomb Raider shines, where you don't quite realize how fast your heart was pounding until you get out of the treacherous situation in question.   Where else does Tomb Raider shine? As a game from 2013 and what can truly be considered the first 'current-gen' Tomb Raider, the island environments and gorgeous vistas they provide are really stunning. I experienced the game at highest graphical settings, and there were really some moments, staring off into the distance, that really took my breath away. The lighting is rich and varied, the weather systems are, for the most part, fairly dynamic. Environmental effects, such as fire, frost, and thunder, could be maybe just a little more intricate to match the incredible island areas as a whole, but that said, they do hold up nicely. The rain effects really should be commended, as there's already a lot going on, and even when there is, the rain still feels - and hinders your sight and abilities - as rain should. A lot of games around this iteration's conception have kind of missed the mark there, so... well done! Also commendable is Camilla Luddington's voice acting work, which was rich, varied, and nuanced. She does a great job at making you really feel like you're in Lara's shoes as she goes from scared, timid archaeologist to hardened survivor.   Which brings me to the areas where Tomb Raider, unfortunately, does not shine. While Luddington's voice acting is nearly impeccable, the voice acting where other characters are concerned just really doesn't feel up to par. Maybe that's why Lara was the only character I felt truly invested in. The game clearly tries to show you which characters you should care most about, and does a lot to try and make you care for them, but in actuality, it just falls short. In the game's most pivotal moments, when my friends' lives hung in the balance, I found myself more excited about getting past this new development so I could get back to camp and upgrade my weapons, than I cared about my friend being in mortal danger. And this is where the cracks in Tomb Raider start to show. You don't really play it for the story, and I wouldn't dare tell someone to pick it up for that; you play it for the incredibly gorgeous views, the environments, the gripping interactive cinematics...  As I've seen other reviewers note, the story is indeed lacking. I do think Tomb Raider got a little ahead of itself and tried to be an FPS, slightly open-world, action-adventure-exploration epic all at once, throwing in exploration itself as a last-minute thought, and the nuances got lost there.   Exploration and upgrading is pretty standard for those familiar with upgrades in any other linear FPS game. Collect resources, upgrade your weapons, rinse and repeat. I did appreciate that there are a lot of choices presented in how exactly to take down your enemies as you approach late-game arsenal. In this way, having to take down hordes of enemies never really gets boring. Climbing and related activities actually work really well, even though I thought it'd be awkward trying to do so in third person, it's actually...not. Just... get ready for button mashing. And I mean button mashing.  Playthrough (not going for 100% area completion, but taking time to see the sights, so to speak) took me a little over 19 hours.   Overall, I think Tomb Raider can be recommended even though my review probably makes it sound like a mixed bag. I think you just have to remember that you came for the environment and cinematic moments, rather than the storytelling and oversaturated character development.   So long as you remember that, you should enjoy your stay on Yamatai just fine. Well...maybe enjoy isn't the right word considering you'll be trying to survive... heh.  Definitely worth a pick up if on sale, and maybe also even if not, if you're a Tomb Raider fan looking for a new take on the series with a good dose of an adrenaline rush.",

            "review_text": "  Short review:    Tomb Raider? More like 'Horde Killer'!  Most of the time instead of looting tombs and exploring, you will be killing never ending waves of enemies, as one shoot-out scene is followed by another. And while the graphics are looking great, the shallow gameplay outweighs all the positive aspects of the game.    Long review   Tomb Raider 2013 is a reboot of the franchise, taking you back to the very beginning, when Lara Croft wasn't the experienced adventurer we know since 1996. Following the shipwreck on a Japanese island Lara is fighting for survival, while going through a journey that changes her forever…  At least that’s the concept on paper. But let’s see how it actually looked!  When you first take control of Lara, the first thing you will notice, that how vulnerable you are, and you can’t help to feel empathy for her for being in this desperate struggle for survival. The game starts out great, as your main objective is to regroup with your friends while trying to survive against both nature and hostile survivors. During this section of the game Lara’s tools and weapons are very limited, but as the game progresses and your arsenal grows, the character development suddenly stops. After the infamous attempted rapé scene, where Lara first kills a human being, the game almost instantly turns into a brainless shoot-them-up. Up to that point you tried to sneak upon enemies or evade them, after this point you will be killing them in group of dozens.  In order to progress you will be FORCED to kill everyone you see, else you will be swarmed. These „horde” sections happen very often and they get increasingly frustrating as the game progresses. By the end of the game Lara transforms from an unexperienced survivor into a battle-hardened killing machine. Seems like somewhere during the game development the Crystal Dynamics guys lost their focus... The swarm events paired with dumbed down puzzles deliver a very shallow gameplay. The platforming sections of the game are great, and very creative but sadly there are not too many of them, and they are simply not enough to compensate the mindless shoot-out sections.  The graphics wise Tomb Raider is one of the best looking games on PC and it’s fairly well optimized: it provides you with stunning visuals if you have a good rig, but it runs on weaker hardwares too. Overall, Tomb Raider 2013 is a mediocre game at best, and I would only recommend it for fans of TPS action/shooting.  If you are looking for good adventure game, then play the older Tomb Raider games and avoid this one as far as possible!     PROS:    -Gorgeous graphics. -Environment and level designs are very well done. -Platforming sections are very creative and fun, but sadly they are overshadowed by the shootout sections which fill out the majority of the game.    CONS:    -Handholding gameplay: the „survival instinct” skill shows you everything, including waypoints, object you can interact with and even highlights the enemies for you -Puzzles are obnoxiously easy. -Barely any tombs to explore. There are around 10 of them in the game, some of them are even DLC content, but most importantly they only require about 5-10 minutes each to complete. -Repetitive and extremely frustrating gameplay. While the game starts out great, it soon turns into a mindless shoot-em-up as you will encounter hordes of enemies every 5-10 minutes.",

The graphics are excellent and realistic (there's a graphics option specifically for the quality of Lara's hair, as you've probably already heard). Lara's actually a character now, with personality, a realistic body shape, practical clothing, and dirt and wounds from the beatings she's taken, rather than a Barbie doll with guns. The new combat system is reasonably good. There's a story that's more than just a brief series of cliches (okay, maybe not  that  much more, but it's a hell of a lot better than what the original  Tomb Raider  had to offer).  It's not all good news, though. There's a bit of dissonance in the story, for example, where Lara has an emotional breakdown over killing a man, and not long after, guns men down by the dozen without batting an eyelash. Lara's incredibly slow to figure out a 'twist' that seemed a little too obvious to me. And... there seems to be something... missing from the gameplay. What could it be? Oh, yeah: tombs, and the raiding thereof. Sure, there are a few 'optional tombs', but they're short and simplistic compared to the puzzles from the old  Tomb Raider . Aside from those few optional areas, the gameplay is even more dumbed down: all exploration and shooting; no puzzles whatsoever. Maybe from a marketing standpoint, it makes sense to turn  Tomb Raider  into yet another bloody shooter, but it still comes as a disappointment. In keeping with the commercialism, they've also sunk resources into a multiplayer mode, but it's buggy and nothing to write home about, and the lobbies are often deserted. The final nail in that coffin, of course, is all the DLC, some of which is for abilities and weapon mods that can easily be earned in-game, some of which is for multiplayer goodies that aren't much good when hardly anyone plays multiplayer, and some of which is for extra optional tombs (I haven't bought any of those, but if the tombs in the base game are any indication, they're a ripoff).  In conclusion: by all means, buy this game, but be aware that you're buying a  Tomb Raider  that has forgotten that it's supposed to be about raiding tombs, and don't bother with the DLC.",

Multiplayer is imba because those who have played longer have more unlocks. Ive experienced a few crashes/instability. Highest hair animation setting will tank your frames per second (if not using AMD gfxcard)  Overall, if you want a pseudo open world/linear/scripted/QTE high-budget 'next gen' title, or you just have a lot of free time and patience, then this game might be for you.  If you were expecting a real open world game, challenging puzzles, survival elements, and a skill system with depth, then im sorry to say you will not find that in this game.

Before I start of about the game itself though, there are two things worth mentioning: first, as a classicist, I cringed quite a lot at how the virtual artefacts were treated. Secondly, there was a beautiful message at the beginning of the credits about how the developers valued us gamers. I loved that.  This game is very plot oriented and tries to immerse the gamer in an adventure filled with drama, feelings and action. The gameplay revolves around puzzles, leading to fighting, leading to 'escapes'. There is also a good number of challenges for those perfectionists who like that sort of thing.  Within the story, there are only a few characters one can like: Roth, Grim, Lara (stereotypical innocent and humble hero), Sam (damsel in distress) and maybe, just maybe some people can relate to Mathias? I couldn't; too evil. So there is no character development (though they tried) and this part of the plot is not so good. The actual story of the game however, is not so bad. It's quite simple and easy to guess since there are only so many characters involved and there aren't very many parameters to have to decode. Even so, I still enjoyed going through it and there were a couple of pleasant surprises waiting for me even through my somewhat cynical approach to the story. The game mechanics are something I have mixed feelings about. On the one hand, controlls are easy and unobtrusive, and the other hand the game was just made easy. Every ledge that I can (have to) hang on to is painted white and the crosshair for the aim is big enough for me to kill every single enemy with a headshot or two. Enemies can be strong but There's only so many of them and there is more than enough cover at all times. The graphics are ok. I rarely ever stopped to say wow, but neither did I stop to look at any glitches or bad textures neither. The music was good as well, but nothing too memorable.   Overall; I only got under 10 hours of gameplay out of this game, even though it was an expensive game when it came out; but it also has to be put into account that I did not stop to complete all the challenges and get every single collectible (at least not in all the districts, overall completion of %77)   TL;DR- get this game if it's on sale for under $10.",

Despite uproar over gameplay changes, this was a very fun game with plenty of exploration but still linear enough to find your way and move the story. The writing is pretty good and the voice acting is above average; it's refreshing to hear a realistic British accent even if she does say 'elevator'.  The game can be a bit heavy-handed with the QTEs, particularly at the beginning, but hours of playing around and exploring is enough to drown that out.  Also worth mentioning: the death animations. God, this game has a lot of death animations. No simple ragdolling for Lara Croft. Enjoy watching a few particular ones again and again as you fail to get past the damn quick QTEs.  Nonetheless, this is a very polished game with only a couple of bugs (worst was when I did a combat roll and slipped through a rock into the void).  I heartily recommend this game.",

I think that game has too much combat for my taste and it could really have better puzzles and more tombs to explore in general.

This is a style that we have become familiar with but thankfully Tomb Raider has resisted the urge to copy it slavishly. Instead, Square Enix have introduced simple RPG skills and upgradeable items, deepening and improving the the title’s cinematic experience. And what an experience it is. Free from the annoying constraints of actual people and real explosions, the developers at Crystal Dynamics have created an action romp that would put even Michael Bay to shame. Tomb Raider is a hell of a ride, and its filmic feel is incredibly well developed throughout the entire gameplay experience — a feat of aligned game design that is rare to see, and even rarer to see mastered. Tomb Raider is a mature experience featuring a young, strong woman who - armed with grit, determination, and intelligence - rescues not only her friends but herself as well. Surely there’s a lesson in that for the rest of us.",

DLC is absolutely optional, all about multiplayer.  POSITIVES: - At the first glace you can see how good and detailed are the graphics. I usually don't care that much about it, but this game gives you the reason to care. It also runs smoothly on mid tier PCs. - While it is an exploration game, it does not overwhelm and punish you, the exploration is fun and incredibly nicely incorporated into the game. - Gameplay and controls are fluid, the learning curve is steep for first 45 minutes, but after that you shouldn't have any issues with it. - Decent stealth parts. Wish they were more than a prelude to shooting action, but they're generally fun.  NEGATIVES: - It is kinda sandbox open-world, but it's a bit linear. After you have finished a region, it's almost empty. - The story is weird and hard to follow at the beginning, but it comes together towards the end.  NEUTRALS: - Poor multiplayer, but the SP is so great I don't even care one bit.  Overall, I don't think many people will find it as their favorite game, but I struggle to find reasons not to like it. It's just great, but not prefect. I wish the island part was more engaging, they really could've created something special with it, especially considering how great the graphics are. It's more a colletion of paths that could've easily happened in a jungle. Maybe I'm just too influenced by all the survivor movies and games like GTA/SR, but the location is not homogeneous as it could've been. Anyhow, I'm looking forward to buying ROTTR in near future after playing this one.",

            "review_text": "Very recommended, fun game. If you have every played, or wished you could play the Uncharted games on Playstation 3, you can't go wrong with this game. it takes what made the original Tomb raider games great, and takes them back to square 1, easing you into a game full of traversal and a few puzzles, but with some familiar gun play and cover shooting and stealth.  You will find that the game has a lot more to it than the Uncharted games however, with much more variety in traversal, and different gadgets that help you get around, such as a rope and arrow to make ziplines, and a climbing axe allowing you to climb all over specific walls, unlike the very linear nature of the Uncharted games. another aspect that removes itself from the Uncharted game's linear nature is the free-roaming hub world mechanic, which means you can go back and explore any area you have previously visited, with new gadgets to get to new areas, and even with this, you never really need to back track too much, and when you do, you don't feel forced into it, you do it because you want to.  Weapons are pretty good too, you get a bow, a pistol, an assault rifle and shotgun, which can be upgraded throughout the game, increasing their stats and adding secondary modes such as a grenade launcher on the rifle, flame arrows for the bow, silencers for the pistol and rifle, and incendiary rounds for the shotgun, you can also carry all 4 weapons at all times, and switch between them at will. so although there are only a few weapons, you always have access to the right tool for any job, and the different modes mean they never get boring.  This game is also very good looking and well optimised for PC, giving me a solid 50fps with all settings maxed out except AA on my mid-range PC. (AMD FX-8350/AMD HD 7870)  My only complaints are that the enemies are rather cliché, (grimy cultists and tough-as-nails mercenaries), quite a few things that happen in the plot are rather too convenient, and QTEs can be rather unforgiving near the beginning of the game when you haven't got the hang of them, thankfully you are never far past a checkpoint, however that could be a complaint if you like games that punish you more for failure, I personally don't mind, too many times have I given up on a game that took me back too far when I died, or i had to stop playing between few and far between checkpoints  for DLC I would recommend not bothering with Multiplayer DLC, as Multiplayer is dead, nor would i recommend the skins, none of which look as good as default, however I would recommend  Tomb of the Lost Adventurer Agility Skill Pistol Burst Pistol Silencer Animal Instinct Headshot Reticule  all these together come to just over £1 when on sale, and are single player upgrades which should have been included in the base game as far as I'm concerned, this should save you about £1.50 off the GOTY price.",

First of all I tried many TR game before, but none of them interested me, I mean they was not my style, genre games, so wasn't expect that will like this game too. But I purchased it (one good man recomended it to me) and after finishing some chapters/missions I noticed that game takes me in and takes me deep inside, yes exactly. First time I played female character and feel myself as a main character, every thing around is taking you deep in to its world, cutscenes that synchronously moving in action and vice versa are making you part of all the actions inside, like you are in movie, like you are part of the movie, very beautiful and atmospheric world around you that smoothly changes from peaceful right up to the horror, makes realistic and deep feelings, every thing there is hostile but beautifully calming, whole world is against you here. Didn't expect see so many genre in so harmonious union with each other - Atmospheric, Adventure, Puzzle, Quest, Action, Stealth, Horror, H&amp;S, Survival all with some kind of RPG elements spanning you in after every moment. Game is very active for what I was expecting from Tomb Raider game. For me TR becomes one of the best games that I ever played before, I didn't expect so deep and fun gameplay, but one negative thing that I didn't like in, is that game is way too easy for hard mode, but it have its good part too - you can relax and enjoy its deep, interesting and fun gameplay. (It's more like Movie for me more than Game, but anyway as I say before 'it's one of the best games I ever played' or 'movie I ever watched' ..? Shortly, who cares, it's great so don't miss it). Game for me is 10/10, really big + to Developers.  Also can say that game have quite good optimization, also looks great on tweaked settings.  One more interesting thing that I find here was Multiplayer very fun, dynamic and action, but sometimes it have a little problems in finding matches, but more often match starts in 20 sec.  So worth it, game is really Great-Super-Amazing... Thank you for reading and sorry for my bad English.",

            "review_text": "Lately, we have been having quite a few games not just remade, but rebooted as well. And this is the Tomb Raider reboot. While LAra Croft may remain the same in some ways, her persona seems to have changed quite a bit. Instead of making Lara a fearless heroine of the Tomb Raider game, she instead seems like a normal woman, who is pretty much forced to fight for her life, quite literally. From the get go, Lara is battered, bruised, and beaten, from both the elements that surround her, and this mysterious new bunch of protagonists who seem to be in a quite large and deadly cult.   Gone is the trekking from one world locale to the next in the form of levels. Instead, the game opts for a more seamless flow, where the game takes place entirely on an island. A pretty damn big one at that, out in the middle of nowhere. It's an island full of history wrapped in mystery and occult type stuff. Typically a good place for raiding some tombs :) It's gritty, it's dirty, it's completely rotten to the core. And I love it! Now while in previous Tomb Raider games, the game was 90% platforming, and 10% gunfights, you have a much more even mix here. The fire fights are plenty, and there is just enough platforming involved to make it a Tomb Raider title, not just in title. Lara will do some amazing leaps of faith, and usually not by choice. She'll be doing it to survive. Not to find that buried treasure.  The entire theme of the game has gone from the relaxed indiana jones-lite feel from previous games, and adopted a much more sinister and adult tone. It's completely satisfying. It may turn some purists off, but it's their loss.   As for the combat side of things, you will find various weapons that completely the theme of the location Lara is in. A bow, which is made from a makeshift set of sticks, and a string, which works with deadly accuracy. A worn hand gun. A world war II era machine gun. And more. And with the salvage that Lara scavenges, you can even upgrade weapons. Combat is fast, quick, and enemies are ruthless. And yes, there is going to be some QTE involved, but not much. Not enough to be considered overkill at the very least.   Can not comment on multiplayer yet, since I have not played it. But I've heard no issues with it.   Anyway, I can not recommend this game enough. The visuals are amazing. The gameplay satisfying. And Lara went from fearless to just plain badass in one reboot. Buy this game now!",

            "review_text": "Let's get the positives out of the way first because there aren't many of them: The game looks and sounds quite nice. My favourite part about the audio was the voice acting - everyone was great in their role, which kept me somewhat interested in what was going on in terms of the plot.  And now for the rest of the game: While the overall story is fine, the way some of the plot elements were handled was simply lazy - without spoiling anything, there is one moment in the game where you get an opportunity to pretty much resolve the plot of the game in a satisfying fasshion that would make sense. I personally was excited to do this and see where the game would go and what it would throw at me from there. However instead of doing what I wanted to do and what would havge made sense at the time, I was thrown into a cutscene where Lara did something that nobody with a brain would decide to do and just delayed the conclusion until the actual end of the game, which was extremely annoying from my perspective.  Now for my major gripe with this game - the gameplay, or the lack thereof - for the first half an hour or so of the game, the only thing I got to do was mashing random buttons to get through quick time events and press W to move Lara along to the next round of button mashing. After a while you do get some gameplay, but even walking around a level as Lara is extremely unsatisfying - nice and shiny animations of her doing things were always prioritised over fluid feeling gameplay.  Most of the levels apart from a couple of exceptions are extremely linear. The game urges you to use your 'Survival sense' which is just a lazy way to communicate to the player what you want them to do, instead of putting more effort into intuitive level design, so that the player could figure out what to do on their own, even if they are actually being guided without them realising it. The strange thing is that Tomb Raider pretends to be somewhat open world, as you can fast travel between different checkpoints and explore the linear levels and complete optional dungeons which branch off from the main levels.  The way the puzzles are designed is kind of awful. You as the player might come up with multiple ways of solving puzzle thrown at you, but then when you try to execute your solutions, you'll find that what you figured out was in fact 'wrong.' There is no continuity in the game mechanics - just because something looks like something you can interact with, like you have done many times before in the game, you might not be able to because, this time, the game doesn't want you to, which leads to you as the player, getting punished for not thinking the way the designer thought when they were designing the level. This means that you get pretty much no more value out of playing this game, than watching a let's play of it on YouTube.  The combat isn't bad, however the half of the perks that you can acquire when leveling up that affect the combat are kind of useless, depending on your playstyle (aka how many QTEs you want to activate mid-combat), which meant that after I was about halfway through the game, the combat didn't evolve much, as I had already acquired pretty much everything that I wanted to have.  Overall, this game is just one high budget set piece, a very long series of QTEs broken up by badly designed puzzles, walking at different speeds (depending on what mood Lara is in), mediocre combat and cutscenes that you can never just sit back and watch, because you never know when you're going to be thrown into a QTE again.",

I had a lot of fun playing it from start to finish (minus the multiplayer) due to the breathtaking level design, good voice acting (Camilla Luddington), and overall high-intensity throughout the game.  This is an example of a game that you can't play half-awake.  It took me about 25 hours to complete the SP campaign (35+ if you count the MP). One major thing that I feel they did right in this game are the collectibles. It's interesting because they're not hard to find due to skill upgrades and treasure maps but they are actually fun to 'try and get' because of all the platforming involved. It's not enough to know which direction to go. Reaching the collectibles requires an understanding of the map's layout. It's actually very easy to get lost within the beautiful island if you are just prancing around without direction.  As far as the combat goes, I am split 50-50. The game gives you enough freedom with how you can kill your enemies and that allows for some good times. On the other hand, it seems that enemy detection is a bit screwy. As an example, there's an enemy mounted on a turret gun that can see you through walls and will follow you wherever you go even if you are hidden from sight.  I feel that this 2013 version of Tomb Raider is my favorite one so far. Even for an origin story, this Lara Croft is quite different from her predecessor even when you try and imagine how one can become the other. I think that this game should be a starting point for a new series of Tomb Raider games. I do recommend this game to fans of the old games but even more so to those who have yet to play anything from the collection.",

If regenerating health, cover based shooting galleries, quicktime events, and everything exploding and collapsing around you in a spectacular fashion sounds like your cup of tea, then by all means pick it up.  The majority of puzzles are optional, with only a few being forced in the later game. This is my biggest gripe with Tomb Raider as the puzzles are rather good, and would have been better appreciated if integrated into the main story.  Hunting is introduced in the early game, and ignored for the the rest of it. Tomb Raider seems to exist in an open world, but all the survival and exploration themes evaporate once the shooting starts.  Lara is constantly under attack by a barrage of burly men, their bodies lead the way to the next checkpoint and more people to shoot in the face. This approach is pretty standard fare for modern 3rd person shooters, but I always see games struggle to justify the ridiculous body count it produces, and Tomb Raider is no exception.   After all is said about tomb raider as a game, its quite an excellent port.  Graphics are highly customizable, with DX11 support and high res textures. Mouse control is precise and most actions can be binded to keyboard.   I managed to finish Tomb Raider, but I probably wouldn't have if I didn't want to write a review. It does pick up in the later parts of the game which I enjoyed, but it just takes too long to muster up any type of real challenge.    Gameplay : 5 Visuals : 8 Audio: 7 Story: 5   Overall: 6.5  ",

I came across a few glitches that prevented me from moving forward, but with the frequent autosaves, restarting part of a level hardly registers as a negative experience. In the same vein though, death is not really punished. You'll get killed and pretty much respawn in the same spot that you died. Unless you're looking for some sort of Dark Souls experience, I think this is perfectly fine. I played on normal difficulty and died an acceptable number of times. There are definitely challenging parts which I had to repeat a few times, but they're appropriately dispersed between areas of exploration. I wasn't much of a collector in this game and mainly stuck to the main story line. I think I completed it in about 15 hours with ~70%.

Together with that it also has a great and fun story line with action/creepy moments all over! When you are done with the storyline there is still much more to do. You can visit smaller tombs that has some puzzles in them, or just run around the ''island'' collecting ancient artifacts. This game was made in 2013, and i gotta say that the graphics looks AMAZING to be 3 years old.   I have not met any glitches what so ever, and i am very very happy that i could finish the singleplayer 100% without any glitches.  When it comes to the multiplayer, im not a fan. The multiplayer is for sure well made and looks as beautiful as the singleplayer, but i personally think this is more of a singleplayer game.   9/10, Cant wait for the rise!",

These could be more complex in my opinion.  To get a little more in depth: I haven't played tomb raider since the first one on the ps1. My interest in Tomb Raider 2013 was created by seeing the name and hearing it while looking for graphic card benchmarks. After looking in to it I saw a game that looked great and I decided to experience the story myself. I was not dissapointed. The game litteraly sucked me in to it and did not let me go until I finished it. And that took me about 2 weeks. Where I mostly switch games every day and hour this game deserved to be an exception. I truly love the visuals on normal settings. And the voice acting with corresponding character movements were great as well. As for Lara, the main character I was very satisfied with the way she is modeled. Not like the ones I used to know from the ps1 the movie and game reviews as a big boobed sex bomb. But like a beatiful, smart and strong athletic young woman.  Another plus is for the choices of weapons. There are not to much weapons but they are nice and balanced in strength and ammo supplies. My last point about the puzzles or tombs is that I would love to see them more complex and longer. I finished most within 5 minutes and think that they should have been a more important part of the game with a little backstory.   Now I am looking forward to purchase the sequel when the price is right in a sale.",

Gorgeous main menu with a convenient benchmark and breathtaking first few levels, in terms of visuals, audio, writing, and overall atmosphere of constant peril, leave only the best impression. Hunting and the way the world takes a toll on Lara's appearance are a nice touch. Unfortunately, things mostly go downhill from there as automatic weapons and skill upgrades quickly make Lara overpowered even on the hardest difficulty levels, and no one seems to bother taking away her weapons when captured. Some of the optional collectables like GPS caches and maps turn out to be a mostly useless, mostly tedious chore. The ending feels rushed, and unfortunately a disappointing cliché. I also wish there were separate settings for the game and the cut-scenes, because while the game ran smoothly on the highest settings, cut-scenes were noticeably lagging. This may sound overly negative, but only because the game could have been a masterpiece, and instead it is just excellent.",

            "review_text": "I was late to the party with Tomb Raider 2013, I've had it sitting in my Steam library since release as I got it free with whatever piece of hardware it was I bought at the time, but I was a little hesitant to fire it up. Why? Because, as with remakes of our favourite movies (sprinkled with a large dose of nostalgia), remakes always seem to let us down. And not because our expectations are overly high either, but because our memories of the original are barely ever lived up to. I remember spending hours sitting on my bed listening to 'Rust in Peace' by Megadeth whilst guiding Lara around Area 51 and a dark, depressing London in Tomb Raider III having some of the best game playing fun I've ever had, it topped the first two easily and it consumed me for a while, but that was way back when and I haven't revisited the TR franchise since. I was scared those memories would be tarnished, and I was completely wrong...  Of course, if you didn't jump on the TR train from the very beginning back in the nineties and missed Lara in all of her original blocky glory that won't matter as you've nothing to lose. Neither have the gamers who got to know Lara years ago as this game doesn't let the originals down one little bit. There's a big shift from how TR used to play, the game isn't one giant puzzle where even figuring out how to get from A to B could be soul destroying (although there are still elements of it in the game) and there's more of a linear feel to it. That's not a bad thing though as you aren't led through the game literally by the hand, there are discreet pointers and a Survival Instinct which will show you the main path, but there are hundreds of side objectives and mini missions for you to complete which are hugely rewarding in themselves. There is a start point and an end point, no more collection of huge, self-contained levels, but to stay true to the name of the franchise there are plenty of tombs to enter where puzzles must be solved to claim the riches that lie within. There is a sensible array of weapons to be used, and along with some excellent guided action moments they bring a great feel of energy to the game.  The game play itself is smooth and responsive and even through some of the more guided elements of the game you feel fully in control of Lara. It's been slightly awkward for me to revert to a controller while aiming a gun (using my right thumb just isn't anywhere near as accurate as using my Gigabyte M6900 in, say, Battlefield) but it does come flooding back after a while.  The graphics are simply lush, and anybody with a higher end card who can knock all of their settings up to Ultra without even giving it a thought are in for a real treat.   I've yet to finish the game at the time of writing this, but I don't think it will be too long before I do. It's good enough to peel me away from the Battlefield franchise which speaks volumes for the playability of a single player game to me, and I'd have absolutely no hesitation recommending this to any gamer out there as it has enough elements to appeal to you regardless of your favourite type of game. So what are you waiting for? Get your hand in your pocket and stump up the fifteen quid it costs to get the game, then love it to bits.",

However, hang in there. The game afterwards is a lot better, when the game lets you play it.   When not exploring dungeons and doing puzzles, you're half stuck in cutscenes where you'll have to suffer through awful dialogue and half playing whack-a-mole in the tedious gunfights that occur every 10-20 minutes. Boss battles are also a let down, there's not much variety in them.  I did start to warm to the plot as the story progressed, but it's nothing to write home about. The graphics are beautiful in my opinion, I especially liked TressFX althought it's stupid how only Lara gets proper hair and everyone else has the standard glued to head hair. However I feel they should implement TressFX into more games.  Overall, despite my review containing a lot of negativity, I'd reccomend this game. It's kind of like a poor mans Uncharted. I'm just hoping they address a lot of the problems in the next game cause I'm looking forward to playing it.",

            "review_text": " TL;DR:  I recommend buying it if you prioritise character development, setting, story and action over difficulty and challenge. If you don’t, but you’re a fan of the franchise, I’d still recommend buying it when it goes on sale. If you aren’t a completionist, be warned, you might find this game short. ---------------------  The first five minutes of the game give you a very accurate idea of the course that Lara’s adventure will take: several gritty moments, fast paced action and struggle to survive.  One of the things that impressed me the most was the powerful immersion in the story, setting wise. This game has an incredible scenery, so much so that landscapes are breath-taking and views are always worth appreciating. However, because the island was the last destination of aircrafts and ships of all historical ages, sooner or later you feel that the beautiful place is aggressively hostile to outsiders.  While it is true that Lara has to find her way through the island and overcome several environmental challenges, I think that there were a couple of missed opportunities to make the island itself a real antagonist to the adventurer. For example, at the very beginning of the game you must hunt a deer because Lara is hungry; nevertheless, from that moment on hunting becomes completely secondary and even dispensable. Maybe that’s nit-picking, but from my point of view, some things could have been added to emphasize the ‘woman versus wild’ premise.   In regard to the main plot of the game, it is decent. You might find it to be quite linear and I didn’t consider the foreshadowing to be effective. However —and this is why I loved the game so much— the character development is magnificent. Through the game you witness Lara’s evolution from being a naïve youngster to being a hardened survivor; personally, this added a lot of value to the game and to the reboot itself. You experience the birth of a true adventurer that has a very realistic human side. Lara’s strength doesn’t exclusively lie on sheer badassery anymore; her strength comes from experience and self-improvement. She’s afraid, she doubts, she suffers the burden of responsibility and guilt… she’s human. Besides, if you collect the documents along the game, you get a glimpse of Lara’s relationships with her friends and even what her father and her last name mean to her. Everything contributes to make her a deep character to whom you can empathize with.  Finally, I would like to refer to one of the weakest points of the game: difficulty. If you enjoy challenging games, this one will probably not suit your taste. Unlike other Tomb Raider games, puzzles aren’t hard and most of them aren’t key to advance in the storyline (puzzles are mostly find in optional tombs). It’s unlikely that you get stuck somewhere and need to use guides or extra help to advance. Enemies aren’t hard either and even the ending of the game doesn’t represent a relevant trial.  The game is also quite linear, even if there are a couple of extensive maps, you don’t have —complete— freedom to explore the island. Due to its linearity, if you’re not aiming to end the game at 100% and/or with all achievements, I would recommend buying it only when it goes on sale, because it might not take you more than 13 hours to finish it. In addition, if you’re looking for some multiplayer action, go look elsewhere, because multiplayer is dead most of the time.  To sum it up, I think this is an excellent reboot to the franchise because Lara has become a deeper character, more human, with more value. Besides, it keeps many things from previous Tomb Raider titles, like ancient ruins and the misterious thin line that exists between myths and reality. I’m definitely looking forward to playing the next titles.",

You don't feel frustrated to make jump or when you're dealing with combat, it is very precise. Every location you go to is different and lovely to look at. If you have rig that can max it out, WOW. The game is in real-time so Lara has dirt on her face and body, you'll see the scars and cuts throughout your game and in cutscenes. If she falls in mud you'll see her get covered and it wash off in the rain or in water. Also you see the costumes (DLC) in cutscenes –Bonus! The attention to detail is fantastic.  The character progression of Lara is great. As this innocent girl has to now fight, kill, suffer and go through hard ships to survive. You can upgrade Lara by finding salvage and xp.   The down side to this game is the game is a bit too easy. You really can't fail the platforming, the tombs are way too easy and they give you a stupid highlighting thing (can't remember what is called). It’s great for locating animals and plants and when you upgrade Lara for hidden items but it just makes it to casual friendly and for someone like me who likes to play their games on Hard Period Its just... Blah! There is no way to turn it off.  Also there is no replay value. Yes you play it again because it’s that good! There are collectables – but here is the problem. You can go through the whole entire game no getting the collectibles. But you need them to upgrade Lara. Now say you beat the game. You can go back through the game and collect them but it’s so boring! There are no enemies; they don’t respawn after a while or even going to the next area and on top of that no new game plus. This is good because the game is easy enough as it is. So going back through the level for the collectables is just empty.  This game is a must play. And I recommend playing it on Hard. I played with X360 controller. I did not play the Multiplayer.  Also Kudos to CD, for PC support. When some things weren't working they brought a patch out quick. Also they changed the Tress FX (Hair physics) for Lara as well because there were a few problems. This is a fantastic game, no laziness done here. Just like Metro LL and a few others.   Oh!

Game controls are decent enough to work as you intent most of the time, even though sometimes Lara refuses to climb ledges on the first try.  Then we arrive at the cons: First of all camera shakes and stutters around spasticly, that ah so cheap effect straight from bad movies is used to absolutely last drop to create feeling of 'urgency', but what it achieves is that the game feels like some teen has videod it with cheap handheld.  Game is riddled with quicktime events in which oftentimes you are not given the button to smash untill it is too late, so you have to play many of them couple of times as you need to know what button to start hitting before it is actually show to you in game.  Story and characters are shallow at best. Story tries and tries again to make you feel for the characters which are just empty shells of bundled together clichés. All the story development can be seen coming from miles away and when it finally arrives all it manages to achieve is tired yawn.",

This is the Tomb Raider I have been looking forward to playing, more like a FPS, so I enjoy Those games more, but it Really didn't remind me of the other games so it was refreshing, but different to Not be in some kind of Tomb. There are parts that have this kind of thing, but my memory says they were few and far between. Mostly you get used to hopping Jumping and ziplining, like before.  I am so in love with this game and the way it plays and looks. No other thing sells me more, than the fluid game play and beautiful scenery. Yeah, that and heights. Did I mention I hate them? If you have a queasy stomache for heights you'll be like I am; Not wantingg to look down some time. I did that in Portal. Its funny sim games that have the heights are so much better than they Used to be. Tomb Raider is, I think. The story is OK but the game and all the other things make this a 'buy', when it comes on sale if it isnt already.  I'd get the GOTY version of this and all sales for November and December are starting up, so keep a few bucks around if you see this come on sale. You'll have a blast! (Now the price is right).",

The gameplay is fun and challenging, but not too difficult to be fun, the graphics are spectacular, and we finally have a good origins game for Laura Croft.

In several different areas of the campaign, you are required to push a particular button at a particular time, however, it does not register when pushed. This frequently causes an automatic failure and a reloading of the game to the latest checkpoint. I enjoyed playing the game until I got to a point where you are required to push several different buttons in a particular sequence, and the computer simply won't acknowledge that the appropriate button has been pressed, leading to an inability to continue to progress through the campaign.",

Crystal Dynamics did a stellar job in creating Tomb Raider's atmosphere, a cinematic beauty that actually manages to transfer the excitement of discovering a lost civilization into the hearts of the player. The puzzles are fun, some aspects of combat entertaining, and the collectibles are one of the few that I actually bothered to gather. That being said, the game does come with it's flaws. Overabusing quick-time events is, without a doubt, the largest problem as it constantly snatches control away to create something more similar to a movie than a game. There is too much emphasis on combat, whereas the puzzles, which ought to be the focus, are more or less shoved to the corner as optional tasks (Its called 'TOMB' Raider for god's sake). Character development isn't that great. While most characters get at least one scene in the spotlight, they never get enough screen time for the player to fully understand them (Ahem* Sam). Finally the game is short, with a storyline that lasts around 15 to 16 hours.  Nevertheless, a solid game that should definitely be considered for purchase. 8/10",

The story is an origin story - about how Lara Croft became who she is in all the older games; you know - that badass woman with the big breasts that kicks ♥♥♥♥.  Anyways, onto the game itself as well as the gameplay.   The Game:  Tomb Raider (2013) is (at least in my opinion) a pretty fun game - it's not a platformer in the same way that the older games were, it's more of a third-person shooter with some 'platforming' things added. Lara's hair is pretty fancy if you enable AMD's TressFX (which luckly for me, works with Nvidia GPUs). Anyways aside from her hair - poor Lara gets the living ♥♥♥♥ beat out of her in this game, I'm not sure how a woman who has NEVER even fired a gun or bow can all-of-the-sudden master these types of weapons and also suddenly take all this damage and kill all these people.  Maybe it's because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s stole her bestest-friend and want to sacrifice her to some god or whatever - I mean if some people took my best friend I'd do some crazy ♥♥♥♥ too to save her, but that's besides the point. I'm not gonna jump over a cliff with a 100 foot drop at the end and hope my  ice axe  can stick into a  rock wall , then climb 30 feet to save her, I'm not even sure I could do that considering my health, and the fact I'm using an  ICE AXE ! Anyways this isn't about me - this is about Lara f*cking Croft - so I guess she's just a very quick learner and able to kick some serious ♥♥♥♥ very quickly too... Maybe I could learn all these things too? Although I already know how to fire a gun and shoot a bow, so that would help me, but I'm not Lara and this isn't my game.  The game does have an OK story - and  SPOILER  ends in a happy way.  END OF SPOILER  Anyways it does all seem a bit extreme as an origin story. Now if the game was about Lara just doing what she always does it'd make a hell-of-a-lot more sense, but whatever that was the developer's choice to make.   Gameplay:  The gameplay mechanics are pretty straightforward - there are some quicktime events, which I hate, but hey, it was a console game to begin with, so we PC gamers will just have to deal with it - just try not to get Lara's head impaled on a random spike when sliding down water-rapids, kay? Lawl.   Aiming is easy, as is taking cover. There is plenty of ammo for her guns and arrows for her bow, in addition there are puzzles to solve, similar to the ones in Half-Life 2, except they require a little bit more thinking, in some cases. I found the puzzles to be kind-of fun, but some people I know hated them - but what do they know?! This is MY review! In addition there are weapon upgrades - for instance you may start out with some kind-of WWII submachine gun but end up with an AK-47 - which isn't an SMG at all, but an assault rifle.  Aside from the quicktime events, the jumps over 100 foot falls just to dig your axe into a cliff and climb 30 feet, and the puzzles - this game is your basic TPS (third-person shooter). It also has some cutscenes but I didn't find them annoying or unnecessary, but again that's just my opinion.  When it comes down to it, I do love a game with a badarse strong-willed female protagonist, and these kinds-of games are becoming more common these days - either the main character is one - like in this game, or you can choose from a selection of characters and one is a female (for instance the Borderlands series). I like this game and I also think it looks pretty good, especially with that amazing hair! xD   Multiplayer:  The multiplayer is rubbish - it's a tacky addon similar to the multiplayer in Bioshock 2 - I recommend avoiding it unless you actually happen to like it... I found it's full of hackers and people ranked way higher than you so no fun there. That'll be the end of this...   Conclusion:  Overall I find this game pretty fun, and as I said before, having a strong female protagonist adds to the appeal (at least to me). The quicktimes events lower the score a little, however I had no problem watching the cutscenes. I found the climbing mechanics and other stuff like the rope-arrows pretty easy to master and nothing was really that hard, not even the 'bosses'. I do think the multiplayer is garbage and I'd recommend avoiding it if I were you - just play the singleplayer, that is fun enough.   Score: 4/5 - Great Game with an Amazing Protagonist     [Edits made to fix grammatical errors.]",

The developers managed to make an action-adventure game that's grim, dark, violent but at the same time it offers a good share of exploration, puzzles and beautiful landscapes. It also isn't a clone of said game, while it clearly borrows the hollywood movie action scenes and timed events, it doesn't abuse them and everything fits perfectly. The game also add things that Uncharted lacked, as backtracking and exploration letting you to step out of the 'rails' of the main story to complete the optional quests. This said, game's story is interesting and unfolds nicely. Combat feels well, while it's not very complex, it offers the player a nice quantity of alternatives and tactics to adapt it to his gameplay style. Controls work well, aren't awkward at all and visuals are stunning. As for the bad side of the game, there isn't really to much to rant about, Lara's character development was maybe rushed, she also takes an unhuman quantity of physical punishment through the game and boss battles, and combat in general, wasn't very challenging even in the hardest difficulty. 2013 must play, and I'm hoping to see more of Lara's adventures in the future. 8.8/10",

            "review_text": "Uncharted meets the Batman Arkham titles minus the melee combat system.  Now i ,being a fan of both the aforementioned franchises, found the game to be extremely fun to play and very hard to put down.  I was awestruck with the setpieces and the incredible attention to detail in the environments. Also neat little touches of realism here and there like Lara touching the walls to maintain her balance, her feeling uncomfortable trying to get through a tight space etc.  The combat in this is pretty much your standard TPS fare with a twist: instead of a cover button there is an evade one and most encounters are against enemies that will try to pin you down while their allies get up close trying to finish you off.  Taking into account the fact that cover can be set on fire/ blown/shot off the combat system forces you to be on the move for the most part, constantly evading shots and going from cover to cover.  The other half of TR involves exploration and some puzzle solving. The puzzles in this are very easy to figure out but due to their physics-based nature you may have to restart a couple of times to nail down the execution.   By exploring you will find some collectibles that will offer further insight on the island and its inhabitants as well as some personal notes from your crew members that add context. Gathering said collectibles and completing sets rewards you with +xp to spend on unlocking skills that make Lara a more profficient adventurer and combatant.  The other drop type in TR is salvage which you can use to upgrade your weapons.   Finding gun parts from time to time will allow you to spend salvage on a gun in order to unlock some modifications for it.  What i really liked about the collectibles in this game is the fact that you get to examine these artifacts up close by twisting the camera and you'll even get to spot little details in an attempt to get some more clues on their origin, etc.  Hunting Animals is also another way for you to get +xp and salvage. Killing way too many animals in one specific area however will remove all +xp +slvg rewards forcing you to change your hunting grounds.  The story is nothing groundbreaking but it's interesting enough to make you want to keep progressing, although i feel that the support characters could've been given a bit more personality and character. They feel way too much like the Scooby Bunch at times.  Finally the PC version is of the highest quality, as i've come to expect from Nixxes with tons of options and jaw-dropping visuals.  All in all highly recommended. ",

This might have been the intention of the game, seen as we play with Lara.  The map, lots of areas look the same although I will say that they still had their own unique vibe.  Tombs, some of them were easy, some were very very hard so they had a nice balance.  FPS, well, it was irratic to say the least. I have quite a good PC and whilst mostly I maintained 60 FPS (with Vsync) the game did stutter from time to time which IMO took away from the experience. Did not seem like it was optimised too well. It was good for the most part.  In closing, I do like this game. FInding the collectables was a challenge. I did play this on console so knew what I was doing for the most part on my PC play through.

I felt that it was really well done however I felt the story was a bit to short. I got 10 hours of gameplay in and I felt like I took my time. One thing that I feel was done rather well was the progression of your weapons as you play going from a crude wooded bow to a high powered compound bow.   I liked the gameplay style as well. It allows for multiple styles of gameplay. You can sneak passed enemies or you can go in guns blazing. I prefer the sneaky style of play and found it to be quite well done.   In terms of story I felt it was really well done as well with the character evolving as you play though the game. It is also the one game that I have played where I get a feel for how much the character suffers. The story does suffer from being a bit on the short side for my liking making the game rather quick and to be honest as good as the game is I am not that tempted to go for a replay.   Overall I think it is a good game. I can't comment on how well it fits into the Tomb Raider franchise but as a game it has nice graphics, a decent story, and lets just say that Lara's cries in pain are a bit to sensual to be pain.",

Crystal has no longer tried to make Lara's boobs as large as possible, instead they are focusing on what she REALLY is! A survivor, an archaeologist, a sweet and kind character on the outside but when needed she can be a real hardened character! Aside from Lara, the new set of characters since Tomb Rader Underworld is definitly a big change! They all have their own personalities and attitudes to match the game perfectly for being stranded on an island! The Optional Tombs in my opinion are a great add-on but I wish some of them were a bit longer. Especially the DLC one! You are paying $3.99 for it and it's this short segment that is also glitched! Yes, you heard me right, if you don't do a certain part right, it'll glitch the game and you have to go back to your last campfire save (you can't do the checkpoint save as the game saves the glitched state.) I know the Multiplayer has gotten a lot of criticism, but it actually isn't half bad! While it's not like Call of Duty or Left 4 Dead type of Multiplayer, you can definitly have some fun with the four modes they have! However in order to really get the experience, you need to buy the DLC Maps! I own all of them and they are all good! And surprisingly it's still fairly active! You'll find quite a few people online! While Tomb Raider isn't as good as the Classics in my opinion, it's definitly a great title and is in one of my top favorite games!  *This comment has been given by a lot of Tomb Raider fans and in articles comparing Tomb Raider 2013 and the Classics. I personally agree with it! If you haven't played the classics and don't know what I mean, I'd recommend doing a Google search on some of the classic Tomb Raider's and you'll see what I mean...",

Suddenly a mysterious raging storm hits and your ship gets destroyed and you and your team get stranded on an island with crazy and murderous survivors and samurai.   There isn't much raiding tombs in this game, that's more of a side project you can do. You mostly try to survive the island and try to save your friends before they die and become part of Lara's character arc. There is also a lot of semi-quicktime events Micheal Bay blow up theme in this game. Like you need to run away from an explosion so you need to hold 'W' so you don't die. Or press 'e' or 'f' at the right time so you don't fall off of a cliff. Honestly as much action there was during these scenes just holding 'W' and watching ♥♥♥♥ blow up beside you was honestly boring.  Though the combat in this game is awesome. It reminds me a lot of Far cry where you get tools and theres targets so go kill them in anyway you want sonny. I had a lot of fun taking out giant packs of crazy people will my bow and arrow (though i found it weird you would kill entire legions of troops then just a cut scene later you get slapped and then you get easily sub-dued which was like wat). I enjoyed the story and the character arc of Lara from simple college student to a full-time survivor killing machine. The game is about 9 -10 hours if you just blaze through the game, there are areas you can explore and raid and multiplayer which I'm not interested in trying but apperantly it's like the 'The Last Of Us' multiplayer.  Honestly besides the weird cutscene, quick time event parts I would buy this game on a good sale.",

Believable dialogue, a variety of enemies, and a uniquely supreme mix of combat and stealth are the mainstays of this adventure- and an adventure it is. A great plot takes you all over the island, though sometimes the pacing falls flat and you end up wandering around a beach for a bit too long for my taste. Combat mechanics were okay- I wish Lara was a bit more responsive- but the weapon upgrade system is well executed. Other games could learn a thing or two from that mechanic. Optional Tombs, complete with deathtraps and other puzzles, provide intellectual distractions if you want to take a break from the main questline. All in all, both the gameplay and the story liken to Far Cry 3, if you replaced vehicles with ziplines and ice-picks, and that's not a bad thing at all.  Graphically interesting, but not cutting edge. For a game that utilizes fire so much, I kindof wish they had payed a bit more attention to it, graphics-wise, but I was playing it on medium settings. Quite a few 'cinematic' moments, but never spoon fed to you- You just have to get used to a few minigame-esque features. I will say that the audio is quite a treat. You can learn a lot by stealthing through an area first, just listening for information.  Perhaps one of the most important things about this reboot is that they (in my opinion) successfully recreated Lara Croft into something much more than the icon of hypersexualization in videogames that she used to be. Now more believable, fallable, but tough down to the bone, Lara is a fantastic main character who grows and develops over the course of the game.   Overall, a good game with a refreshing take on one of gaming's classic franchises. It will leave you entertained and satisfied, but maybe not blown away. B+",

But generally when some horrible injury occurs in a cutscene, it's treated as serious. Not in Tomb Raider. Once she pulls that pipe out of her (dirty,) she holds her side like she just finished a 5k, then onto business as usual.   But business is good. Tomb Raider is like Metroid. Explore a little bit, get a new piece of equipment, now explore previously unaccessible areas. There are enemies to fight, and they're pretty fun to kill. Platforming is typical Xbox 360 era garbage. Follow the one path and don't ♥♥♥♥ up the psuedo quick time events. It all works though. Tomb Raider is like the new Batman games, but the fighting isn't as satisfying.

Other than that the game is pretty good with lots of stuff to do and a beautiful island to explore. Story is mediocre but what makes the game stand out is the action mechanics and the way Lara interacts with everything in the world. The survival element is strong at the beginning but after half an hour worth of killing baddies you seem pretty indestructible and able to take anything that dares to cross your path. That is quite inconsistent with the weak and vulnerable potrait they tried to give to Lara. Despite its inconsistencies the game handles amazingly and is a lot of fun. Would definitetly recommend to any action/adventure fun and to all others a buy on a sale.",

Really solid gameplay, intriguing story, no fluff, and actually fun collectibles with little voiced-over storied included with them.  I got it free with my 290x (with Thief and Sniper Elite 3) in my Digital Storm computer. It is definitely the best Tomb Raider ever. I am definitely glad I chose it, but I don't think it would've been worth $60, but I rarely pay that for any game (Steam sales, Humble Bundles, Amazon digital sales) so it would be unfair to hold that against it too much.  It had enough upgradability for the weapons and skills, pretty cool QTE (Quick Time Events), and a nice mix of puzzles, adventure, cover shooting, and story. Pretty good stealth too (definitely better than Assassin's Creed, which thinks it is a stealth game).  GRAPHICS ARE BOSS. Like totally unexpectedly amazing. Ran on ultimate and then kicked the shadows up one more (shouldn't ultimate be *everything* maxed out?) and played it on a 30 inch 1600p Yamakasi monitor. STUNNING.  I play almost everything except strategy games and MMOs (and FPS, but I don't play those) with my PS4 controller. I use DS4Tool and the XBox One Driver from Major Nelson's page. Everything works great, even the touchpad, you just have to know the 4-button layout for MS controller, but what respectable gamer doesn't know both PS4 and XBox controllers. THIS GAME WAS FABULOUS ON CONTROLLER. I always try with M+KB too, and it was solid, but I prefer controller.  Anything less than fifteen bucks is a bargain for the solid gameplay, really cool story, and truly amazing graphics.",

            "review_text": "Nice story and developments with 1 maybe 2 false endings. Remeniscent to 'lost' in the basic setup.   Levels are tomb raider levels but very open and expansive with fast travel between them so you can go back to previous levels at any time to try stuff out. This is a good thing as some puzzles can only be solved with equipment from later sections of the game. They are much more 'organic' and realistic than previous games, with numerous collectables and things to do in each.  Loved the cable car scene with the ship!  Hunting is in there but is optional. Multiple weapon upgrades, with 16 different weapons in total (though these are as 4 basic weapon types you upgrade up to 4 times as the game progresses).  NIGGLES: wooden crates that you burn out of nets when you find them and where every other wooden thing in the game bursts in to flame instantly, they do not. The game makes extensive use of this burning mechanic, and yet they chose to sent the game in dank, damp environments where things probably wouldn't burn that well...   The Tress FX (TM) hair modelling is very good and realistic but it does make everyone's hair look freshly washed at all times, even when they are bruised, govered in mud etc.  Also though the physics works in terms of the game puzzles, it can be weird at times. e.g. fasten a rope to a raft and pull it, the raft will move towards you. Fasten a rope to something on land whilst you stand on the raft and it stays put no matter how hard you pull ... but I guess they did this so you had to solve problems in a certain way which does mean you get some corking problems!",

            "review_text": "Being a big fan of the action platforming elements of the original Tomb Raider franchise, I can see this game turning a few people off. However, viewed as a game on its own merits, this one is outstanding.  While the overall plot and storyline are pretty basic for an archaeological action-adventure story with supernatural elements, the individual story of Lara, and her rise from a carefree explorer to a hardened formidable warrior was amazing. I haven't really found many games where I feel some type of bond with the character I am controlling; characters more or less act as a vessel for me to engage with other elements of the environment. However, in Tomb Raider, there is this very immersive feel that I haven't seen done this effectively before.  The visual and audio feedback convey so well how much Lara is hurt or suffering, and the various elements in the orchestral score make the moments when Lara is battling against all odds to fight for her life simply outstanding. The voice acting is also superbly done, adding so much more to the immersion. Its easy to distinguish when Lara is scared, concerned, amazed, or charged up and ready to take on the world. The occasional whimpers of pain Lara makes actually helps here, too.  The controls also help further the immersion; at key moments, the character movement is deliberately altered to further emphasize Lara's struggles. As frustrating as it was to have Lara move slow and be unable to do certain actions at one point in the game, I felt the added tension and anxiety it caused to be very engrossing, Various screen effects additionally helped relate how much damage the character has taken, or highlighted the difficulties of seeing and moving in the wind, rain, and snow. I never felt the need for a health bar or other vital stats on the screen; when Lara is hurt and should take cover, it was obvious.  There are moments in the game where I felt a rush of adrenaline as Lara rose up against opposition and obstacle, and moments I wanted to stand up and cheer when she cried out at the enemies, and that 'hell yeah' moment when I kicked someone's ♥♥♥ with her new abilities.  Aside from the immersive qualities of the game, the game design itself is also impressive. The progression system is a definite highlight. Every time I applied some upgrade to Lara's fighting skills, or modified a weapon, it had very real impact on the gameplay. I could feel a significant difference between battles at the start of the game and those at the end. It was yet another massive boost to how immersive the title felt. The only weak point here was maybe the looting skills. But looting is key to upgrading so it made sense.  Levels are fun to explore, especially once the various upgrades to the bow and climbing axe are unlocked. Its perhaps here where the game feels the most like traditional Tomb Raider - climbing up cliff faces, jumping across platforms and ziplining up and down mountains. Sadly though, the 'Tombs' the game has as side missions are  nothing  like the original Tomb Raider. In this game, raiding a tomb consists of solving a 1 or 2 room puzzle, typically using some physics based manipulations. Its the weakest point of the game, and while it can be a fun side challenge, it is nowhere near the type of puzzles encountered in the original Tomb Raider series. Perhaps the sequel to this reboot will put more focus on this, especially if the developers want to appeal to core Tomb Raider fans.  The only downside to this game are the QTE segments, as is true for many games. While its not all that prevalent, it can be frustrating and unfair, especially if a boss fight can't be won without the right button mashing segment. However, there are times when quicktime events are put to good use, to add tension or give the player a chance to save themselves from a horrible death. (speaking of, the death sequences are pretty horrific!)  Combat is tricky in this game, as it requires holding an 'aim' button down while targeting an enemy, and also using dodging to avoid the unfortunately very accurate AI guns. Additionally, the camera angles can be terrible and often times special combat moves become impossible due to which way the camera is directed. This can also make seeing enemies in different areas hard to see, which compounded with aiming makes for frustrating die-and-repeat sequences. However, at times combat works brilliantly. Stealth is emphasized in various points in the game, and is easily the strongest fighting mechanic in the game. Taking out enemies without alerting others is pretty damn fun. There are times though when pulling off some skilled gunplay mixed with hand-to-hand combat feels amazing.  With so much going for this game, and with such a great immersive feel, I can't help but recommend this to everyone. As with most games, it has flaws, but damn when this game does something right, it feels great.  [side note: I said to a friend that there are moments this game feels like Michael Bay and Steven Spielberg (Indiana-Jones era Spielberg) got together and had a lovechild haha.. you'll know when you see the numerous action sequences what I mean]",

However, it still brings some excitement when killing the enemy especially on my first play through.   The skill progression and equipment upgrades are pretty much linear, and you'll get enough points for all if you have been diligently hunting for the artifacts throughout the game. In fact I completed the game with more than enough xp and over 1000 spare salvages with nothing left to spend these on. Thus, for the serious gamers, the RPG aspect of this game may be slightly underwhelming.  Replayability: I did not tried the multiplayer mode so no comments on that. But the solo campaign can be done 2 or 3 times before you get bored of the gameplay. Although trying to go for runs with no death, or minimal backtracking may take some time to do so.  Storyline: 4/5 nothing too unexpected about the story, nevertheless there are some thrills, emotional scences etc. In fact on my second play through, i noticed how the collectible artifacts and notes/diaries breath quite a lot of life to the Island of Yamatai, and gave the story more depth for players to enjoy.  Value for money: 5/5 during steam 75% discount. 4/5 at full price if you like story oriented action RPG.",

You get to watch her go from a fragile and scared girl to a warrior.  The combat controls work rather well, I had no trouble with fighting once I got the hang of it. And there's tons of fighting. Everything was fairly easy to kill, I think, but not as simple as some games. I think the stealth system might have wanted some more work, but overall the game seemed rather polished.

As a long time fan of the series, growing up playing Tomb Raider 2 riding around on the 4-Wheeler and running through the mansion, this was such a nice refresh! They do a fantastic job of making you, the player - really build a strong relationship with Lara again. I feel like this lacked in the previous 'recent' Tomb Raider titles vs the old school three.  -The gameplay is fantastic. Very fluid. Game runs VERY SMOOTH!!!  -Good Controller support - although I very much enjoy these keyboard controls. Everything feels so good and easy to navigate on the keyboard/mouse which sometimes is missing from these 'adventure' type games.  -Simple - yet very good 'upgrade' system for your weapons and skills (bow/melee-knifes/guns).  -Game is just enough linear but has just the right amount of 'open-world' for it to feel more open and enjoyable...just mixes well together. You can explore around and backtrack, but still isn't hard to get lost.  -The story is not too bad - and I'm excited for the new one to come out on the 28th of this month (I don't own a XB1).  -AI isn't TOO dumb, for a change. You have room to sneak but they still notice you and respond which is good. Solid cutscenes and stuff during the action.  -Combat and action/shootouts are SOO much fun. Feels arcade-like but very enjoyable every time you take some one down, doesn't get too old....for me at least.  ****CONS***** - The bow is useful, fun, but does crappy damage. They need to bump up the dmg more. -The whole animal killing and stuff is fine I guess but hardly ever stop to kill animals I guess it's boring to me. I think too many of the skills like melee and guns that u wanna unlock and use u cant yet because you have to invest in the stupid hunting skill to hit the next 'tier.' Kinda LAME!  -THE GAME LOOKS AMAZING! Hands down, best game I seen or played so far. I like to argue that it looks better than the Witcher 3. The Witcher 3 just looks like the world around me is moving too fast or something...I just don't like the movement in the Witcher 3 I think. Tomb Raider doesn't disappoint at all in the visual department. At first I ran the game with a GTX 770 and 8GB of ram on an i5-4690k @ 4.0. It ran smooth as butter, on pretty much ultimate aside from a couple settings turned down (AA to FXAA instead of 2X or 4X SSAA, and maybe Reflections/Shadows turned down a bit). I just purchased a GTX 980 and now I can run the game all maxed aside from the AA. I still can't run at 4X SSAA without my FPS dropping to 40-50ish, and this isn't even on 4k or ultra-wide...just a normal 1920x1080...so that shows it's a powerful game - but it can run well with a lower card and still look fantastic! Just overall a fantastic job by Crystal Dynamics and Square Enix on the optimazation!  Honestly, it's such a good game for $20.00 - I only have 8 or so hours on record and I'm already more than satisfied with my purchase. I haven't even beat the game yet so who knows, maybe the ending sucks? perhaps my review is too soon? Sorry..but the game is still awesome.  BUY IT!",

Then he released an exclusive edition for the consoles is included on the game by even a seasonal pass. The atmosphere of the game just rolls on quality. Emotions and pour! The system is also fighting at a good level, and given that resources are limited. Bleeding our heroine is very simple and requires no special skills (although this could not please everyone). Puzzles, which are an integral part of a series TOMB RAIDER, also found a place in the restart of the legendary franchise. The story captures. Although the ending is a little disappointed. After the game I personally have been waiting for a logical explanation for what is happening on this island (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Spoiler WARNING !!!!!!!!!!!!)  In the end we see the magic, etc. What do throughout the game for some reason was not! Empress Pimiko (do not know how to spell her name) is presented in the form of the living dead as well as its security-army.  What pleased me is a patch that increases the quality of the graphics and most importantly gives Lara Croft realistic physics Hair  But I have no special claims to the game! Game 9.5 / 10 !!!!!   Мне очень понравилась данная игра. Это шедевр 2013-2014 годов.  На протяжении где-то полугода после выхода игры разработчики выпускали массу патчей и корректировали игру! Потом выпустили эксклюзивное издание для консолей которое включало в себя по мимо игры еще сезонный пропуск. Атмосфера игры просто зашкаливает по качеству. Эмоции так и льются! Система ведения боя тоже на хорошем уровне и с учетом того что ресурсы ограничены. Прокачка нашей героини очень проста и не требует особых умении(хотя это могло не всем понравится). Головоломки, которые являются неотъемлемой частью серии TOMB RAIDER, тоже нашли себе место в перезапуске легендарной франшизы. Сюжет захватывает. хотя концовка разочаровала чуть-чуть. Ведь всю игру лично я ждал логичного объяснения того что происходит на этом острове  (!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!ВНИМАНИЕ спойлер!!!!!!!!!!!!)   В конце игры мы наблюдаем магию и т.д. Чего на протяжении всей игры почему-то не было! Императрица Пимико(не знаю как правильно пишется ее имя) представлена в виде живого мертвеца как и ее охрана-войско.   То что меня порадовало это патч который повышает качество графики и самое главное дарит Ларе Крофт реалистичную физику волос   Но у меня нет особо никаких претензий к игре!  Игра 9.5/10 !!!!!",

Graphics are stunning at times, the characterisation and writing is mostly good (Lara's transformation from naive explorer to kick-♥♥♥ killer is a little hard to swallow though), the gameplay is both fun and rewarding and the island you explore is fairly large and interesting (it is not seamless unfortunately). The balance between combat and exploring/platforming is just about right as well.   If I have any complaints about the game it is that the actual tomb raiding is relegated to a small number of one-room puzzles that take little more than ten minutes to complete. Also, the ending and final boss fight was a bit underwhelming but this is not the only game guilty of that and it doesn't really affect by overall opinion of the game which is that it is very good.",

            "review_text": "I've been playing Tomb Raider games since the very first one came out, and although the series had been through its fair share of ups and downs, I've always liked the character of Lara Croft and the idea of traveling to various exotic locales and exploring unknown ruins/tombs/archaelogical locations. Growing up, to me, Lara was always a bit of a role model.... she never backed down, she never gave up, and she accomplished her goals all on her lonesome, relying on no one but herself while out in the field.  The Lara of her prime adventuring days is NOT the Lara we meet here. This Lara is, in the beginning, a naive and relatively sheltered young woman, who is yet to realize her potential. She has a wealth of book smarts, but finds herself way over her head when the expedition boat she's on gets caught in a storm and crashes on a strange island, where danger is waiting. Lara is caught in a struggle of figuring out the mystery behind an unknown mystical force that rules the island, all the while fighting to survive and rescue her friends and escape back home. It is a journey of growth, both emotional and physical. We get to see Lara evolve and adapt to her surroundings, becoming in the end the adventurer that those familiar with the series know her as.  The game offers a very fluid, addictive combination of exploration and combat. In each area, you'll be hunting down numerous challenges, collectibles, salvaging junk (which is then used to upgrade weapons) and figuring out ways to get from point to point. The areas look great (my favorite is Shipwreck Beach!) and fast travel between camps allows to easily transition between already discovered camps in order to make it easier to look for missed items. Combat encounters are fun and in especially large combat scenarios for me I always found it interesting to try and figure out different ways of taking out enemies, whether by shooting exploding barrels, or by pulling them off ledges, or by shooting them off the ropes.   I actually found the story of the game to be fairly interesting, and the collectible documents that can be found throughout the game further expand on it by giving the player glimpses into the island's past. Collectible items (relics) I also found to be of interest, because upon examining them Lara explains where they may have come from and a little bit about history surrounding that specific item.  I have not played the Multiplayer, so I cannot comment on *that* aspect of the game. The single-player portion of the game I would strongly recommend to anyone who is familiar with the TR series and wants to see how it all began.... or for anyone looking for a great game of action, exploration, and character growth.",

I'd heard this new take was more action-oriented than previous incarnations and so I put off playing it for a few years. Now that I've finally gotten through it, here are my thoughts:  This is a fun, very pretty game. There are quite a lot of action sequences and the first half of the game gives you the feeling that disaster is always around the corner. Despite that, most of the action sequences are not terribly frustrating and the game is very forgiving with autosaves.   It definitely seems like the developers tried to include the feeling of exploration and environmental puzzles that the series is known for, but movement through the game is largely linear and the tombs feel like a tacked on chore rather than something you want to seek out. The most fun I had in the game, on the other hand, were some of the sequences where you must overcome obstacle courses to get past or escape foes while buildings are crumbling around you, which happens more times than you'd think would be likely.  It's a fun game in its own right but don't pick it up if you want to recapture the feeling of adventure the older games have.",

Planes crash twice. Bridges fall out. And an elevator doesn't work.

From this game you can expect:    Quick time events - They are common enough for the game to be looked down upon.    Good exploration - Yes it's a linear game but it teases you with exploration so you don't deviate too far from your objective.    Poor dialogue - Get ready for clichéd sentences such as 'I went looking for adventure but adventure found me'     Good puzzles - As someone who loves puzzle elements in games I thought these were good attempts, not to hard and not too obvious.    Good combat - It's nothing revolutionary but combat in a shooter isn't going to be, the uses of the bow however definitely adds a new string to the... bow.

I wasn't hugely enthused or anything, but I didn't want to punch myself in the face and finished it, even picking up 88% of the various collectibles on my way through. The platforming is lacking in obnoxiousness, with most accessible areas signposted well. The combat was amusing, if not especially deep. I actually managed to enjoy wandering around looking for loot. The writing is at par for videogames, ie crap, and I had some problems suspending disbelief - how did the bad guys get into these insanely inaccessible locations? Why can't Lara ever take their mysterious service elevatosr? How the hell am I supposed to believe Lara is still moving? Why doesn't wosshername bandage the actual wound on her arm instead of using the cloth to put her arm in a useless sling?

Along with her adorably inept crew, she embarks on an expedition to find the lost kingdom of Yamatai, home of the sun Goddess Himiko. After an unexpected storm and a series of unfortunate mishaps see the expeditions ship go the way of the Titanic, an almost drowned Lara conveniently washes ashore on a mysterious island bearing great resemblence to the aforementioned lost kingdom. After being reunited with her crew, who were surprisingly competent enough to swim to safety; they make the logically sound decision to split up and search the island, no doubt inspired by spending too much time watching Scooby Doo between their previous failed archaelogical excursions. Velma, wait, Lara, that's the one, then proceeds to make the unfortunate discovery that the islands native inhabitants are inexplicably more hostile than a rabid wolf being taunted with a succulent ribeye steak, and after escaping captivity finds herself responsible for not only her own life but also those of her largely incompetent colleagues, which hang precariously in the balance throughout the game.   Lara spends the first third of the game devising a cunning plan for rescue, which naturally backfires in a hilarious fashion, resulting in a tragic plane crash (No, the pilots weren't Korean) in which both pilots initially survive only to be brutally murdered by the islands local inhabitants. Once Lara finishes briefly languishing in a mixture of self-pity and guilt, she makes the wise decision to get productive and take matters into her own extremely capable hands. It is at this point we discover that Lara is actually the prodigious offspring born from an unlikely love affair between survivalist Bear Grylls and law enforcement extraordinaire RoboCop. Armed with nothing but a cheap wooden bow and an assortment of tools, Lara proceeds to commit systematic genocide, excuse me, i mean commit several hundred counts of self defence against the islands populace, seemingly with no further motive than 'they started it' (Let's hope Lara has George Zimmerman's lawyer on speed dial, she can probably afford it from plundering that entire ONE tomb in this game). The story continues to develop disjointedly amidst periods of quenching Laras insatiable bloodlust, coming to a fantastic conclusion that you'll just have to see for yourself.",

In my case, I didn't but I love this genre so I adapted nicely.

The semi-open world (think Batman: Arkham Asylum) is fun and there are plenty of things to be found, it's just that most of them were too easy to find. Some of the death scenes could rival almost any horror movie. The weapon upgrade system again reminded me of Arkham Asylum, although here you start with nothing but some sticks and end up with an arsenal. All in all, I give the game a 4 out of 5, mostly for the story. It kept me interested and, sometimes, kind of weirded out.

Of course, there are a lot of treasures to hunt, secret places to find and many jump and run situations which are sometimes related to quick time events. The game has pretty graphics, good sound and a nice soundtrack. The level design is very good, and in various quarters even dynamic. Tombs contain the usual climb parts, some well balanced riddles (neither too difficult, nor too easy) and the atmosphere is just great.  Furthermore, TR offers some RPG elements, such as weapon upgrades which allow you to kill your enemies in a lot of varieties and some character improvements (perks) such as higher health/damage resistance, improved aiming, advanced senses or better looting. The new character and body design fits Lara very well and facilitates a more realistic experience than in the previous games. The average length of the game is about 16 hours, if you raid some tombs here and there or collect some of the other goodies out there. After you're done with the game you can still stay on the island and look for missing treasures and items, so the total play time should be around 25 hours. The MP is ok and offers several game types not just deathmatch. It makes a lot of fun to gather experience to unlock new characters and weapons, or just play with/against friends. Under the bottom line is TR a real action-packed jewel with nice graphics, compelling atmosphere, good soundtrack, great gameplay and a well done character and story development.  An awesome game you shouldn't miss, even if you disliked one or all of the previous TR titles, as I did. If you can get it for about 10-20 bucks, then get it - it's worth it.

A ton of exploring and unlockables are available if you want to do all that otherwise there's an exciting game that will keep you on your toes the whole way through.   Tomb Raider feels a little long at parts but the story is well written and will keep you engaged. The characters however are not. Aside from Lara and her older buddy everyone else comes across as flat. The other characters can't decide who they like, what they want to do, or basically anything, often.   Also the quick time events are not as bad as you might expect. When they do come you'll still be cursing them. I'm positive when I say I hit about 20% of them on my play through. The timing never felt right. The inconsistencies between cut scene and quick time were very confusing. At some points where you would expect there to be an event the in-game movie would just play out. Even at places where action was happening that you could have participated in. Where as some quick time events will happen that have you thinking to yourself, 'Really?'  All in all Tomb Raider was a good game. Though feeling a little long towards the end the story was very strong. I could not recommend this for the $60 price tag, but on sale for $15 - $20 it may be worth your time.

This was the re-boot and instead of re-booting the 'TombRaider series' they ignited a fire within all our  hearts again that blazed through the whole gaming community, Pc and Console alike.   Even going as far as making a definitive edition for fans on the next generation consoles, 'Square Enix' truly gave us gamers a wondefully dark beautifully presented game.   Now you might say, well your record for gameplay is inadiquete to write a review, and technically you'd be right,  although I have completed this game twice now once on the Xbox 360 and secondly on the PS4, both times I  didn't feel any less entertained, now I am playing a third time on Pc and the experience has gotten even better.    What does this show, am I a fanboy, is this my only steam game ?, no its not but if it was I wouldn't mind at all  because the truth is 'TombRaider' isin't just fun it's exhilirating.  With a ranking system it give's you even more choice, do you want to be a hunter ?, or a stealthy ninja you can  add attribute points into different categories to fufill specific skill trates and get the job done the way you  feel fit, now the ranking system is quite linear and this is my only pet peeb but not one to ruin this game at all.  You can play different styles, full on action up front in your enemy's face or go the Deus Ex route and be stealthy they will never see you coming if you pull it off right, adding new challenges to game again changing the games  mechanics and thats not to mention all the tomb's, loot and hidden artifacts that create memorable side quests.   This game is filled with an abundance of content, achievements, storyline and graphics that will make you cry wishing  every game developer could create content at this standard and this game is nearly 3 years old.   Are there negative's ?, yes technically if your not into adventure, platforming, 3d shooter's stay away, although  there not negatives are they there prefference's.   I rate 'TombRaider' a solid 9.5 out of 10.   I'll probably play it a fourth time before the next irriteration comes next year.   Thanks for reading and have a great day.     ",

But if you instead focus on the big picture, you'll see that this is a good game and that it accomplishes to do a lot of things right. The shooting and the combat generally flows nicely. There's a lot of little nice exploration to be done. Not too many puzzles but a little to wet your appetite. A grim story and a setting that might remind you of a certain television series. Also the game looks absolutely gorgeous, love it.

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider 2013 is a fantastic Survival-Horror game. Unfortunately, it's a disappointing 'TOMB RAIDER' game. Having entered this game straight from TR Anniversary Edition, I could not get past the stark contrast in challenge/difficulty scale (there is none in this title) and lack of specific character traits of the iconic Lara Croft.   PROS:  * Incredible graphics and scene-scapes throughout * Top-notch art direction  * Masterful music score that really amps up the immersion and tone of the survival-horror theme, the island setting, and the fast-paced, heart-pumping action sequences.  * Fast-paced, heart-pumping action sequences.  * Weapon handling and combat are very smooth for a third-person game; weapon sounds are realistic. *Combat is engaging (no pun intended). A variety of weaponry and gadgets holds your interest and makes you eager for the next battle.  * You get to play as Lara Croft.  CONS:   * You get to play as Lara Croft. But not the snarky, confident Lara Croft you know and love. You will get to play as the bookish, squeamish, humorless, weakling Lara Croft. I get that this is an origin story &amp; Lara's first adventure. But NONE of Lara Croft's innate personality traits are evident here. Sure, a gruesome experience like this will change anyone, but it certainly wouldn't evoke a sarcastic, snarky sense of humor or driving lust to raid tombs later on. I never really felt like I was playing Lara Croft during this game except for the last two minutes of it when the developers suddenly tried to link in a few iconic elements and personality traits.  * This game is way too graphic in its violence - superfluously so. The intense violent nature of Lara's death scenes and her realistic expressions during them are disturbing &amp; potentially nightmare-inducing. This is definitely not a title for the wee kiddos, which is a shame since the ultra-graphic violence doesn't really add anything to the game. This from a gamer who complains there isn't enough gore in zombie shooting titles...  * CHIEF COMPLAINT* There is no challenge to this game. I have been playing video games for 4 decades, &amp; I never played a video game with such a ridiculous level of gratuitous hand-holding before. Pathways and climbing nodes are LITERALLY white-washed in obvious paint streaks and splatters (I'm not kidding). Still stuck? No worries! Press the Q button to activate SURVIVAL INSTINCTS which will turn your entire screen monochrome except for all crucial objects, climb points, &amp; pathways which will be ILLUMINATED IN GLOWING GOLD. What's that? You still can't find all of the collectible objects and relics? No problem! Just earn a few hundred experience points &amp; buy the two skills that reveal EVERYTHING on your (terrible) map! Really, folks. The only way this title could get any more dumbed-down is if your game purchase came with one of the developers who visits your house &amp; plays the game for you while you watch from the comforts of your sofa. If you are expecting a mental challenge the likes of Tomb Raider Legend or Anniversary, your brain will be sorely disappointed &amp; REALLY BORED.  * Tomb raiding is a sad affair. The only 'tombs' you will find here are shallow caves filled with litter &amp; junk. And you -WILL- find them. Notably because there are GIANT WHITE ARROWS (visible from space) pointing you to the tomb entrance. Once you get closer to this elusive cave -- I mean 'tomb' -- entrance, you will REALLY know you found it when LOUD BELLS start ringing madly, like a five-alarm fire in a city made entirely of kindling and newspaper. Once inside the ca- TOMB, you will *REALLY* know you found it because Lara will automatically pull out a torch and walk very slowly to gasp and marvel at such incredible sights as skeletons, stalagmites, impossibly still-lit candles, &amp; about 3000 years' worth of empty soda bottles. Each tomb involves a simple A-B puzzle (one time it was A-B-C!) to reach a giant chest filled with (SPOILERS!) ancient LP records and rolling pins. Lara will then gasp with wanton ecstasy at the contents &amp; take ONE large disc (assumedly with a killer B side) &amp; put it in her under-sized back pocket. Obviously, she can't carry ALL of the treasure, silly! She has a giant hole in her side after being impaled during the intro (a wound which she ignores most of the game during leaps, rolls, &amp; melee combat but later on suddenly bothers her so much she can't climb a ledge two feet off the ground). Plus, she's carrying five fully-modified weapons. One 'tomb' actually had a dead person in it!  * The script is banal, amatuerish at best with only a smattering of inspiring dialogue between two specific characters. Lara's comments during private speech (thinking out loud) puts Captain Obvious to shame. 'Look! This statue of a goddess behind a hundred lit candles and random valuable objects must be a shrine used for worship.' Ya think?  * The plot follows suit &amp; is completely predictable from very early on. Stereotypical characters abound &amp; offer no surprises here. Angry black mechanic is angry. Shady opportunist is shady.  * The map is terrible. Incremental zoom is unforgivingly absent: zoomed in you will lose 70% of viewing ability to the insets &amp; GIANT MAP LEGEND that you cannot resize, move, or deactivate. Zoomed out, item symbols &amp; pathways will be too scrunched together to distinguish from each other since the entire map was made with only two colors. Have these developers never used MapQuest or Google Maps before?   * Very little to no replay value. Multiplayer is a ghost town. Dear Developers: STOP wasting valuable money &amp; resources on an extraneous, unwanted multiplayer component that nobody will play, &amp; INSTEAD spend it on a better script, more single-player content, or - I don't know - maybe inserting actual tombs with challenging puzzles to your Tomb Raider game. A fun, animal hunting mini-game experience with challenges, etc. could have easily been implemented at less cost.  * For all the lush, breath-taking landscapes, very little of it is explorable since pathing is mostly linear and tunneled (though cleverly veiled). Game length is extended only by adding optional recovery of collectables &amp; search-and-destroy challenges within the same linear zones. The lack of freedom to explore such environments awoke my desire to jump back into Skyrim, actually.   * QuickTime Events. Dear developers: if you are going to port over a console game to PC, transform Quick Time events to SLOW Time events. That way, my blood pressure will not spike to unhealthy levels trying to match up three shrinking, concentric circles in 2 seconds at the top left of my screen while at the same time I am squinting at the bottom center of my screen trying to distinguish between a red E and an almost identical red F. At the very least, COLOR CODE the required keypress differently!   NITPICKS:   * I didn't like Lara's voice and found it unfitting the character. I found her voice actor unsuitable for this role, and her pitch and tone didn't match up to Lara Croft in my mind at all. * Lara is dying of hypothermia but is too snobbish to put on a puffy winter coat worn by a myriad of slain enemies. * The E button is used for too many different things. While spamming to pick up ammo, I frequently pulled out a lit torch becuase my ammo for that type was full.  * Some weapon modifications are absurd.  * Lara is squeamish and reluctant to kill anybody, but will find the most extravagant, elaborate ways to execute enemies in needlessly violent ways during her adventure. * An item crafted in the 1830 is not 'ancient'.   If Crystal Dynamics could combine this title with the mentally-rigorous puzzles of its predecessors and eliminate the insulting hand-holding, it could change the industry in profound ways with a new paragon of video gaming excellence.  ATTENTION: PC MASTER RACE! Stock up on RAM now. I've seen the FUTURE, and its name is TressFX!",

Because of this game, I'd probably be prepared to pay full price for the Rise of the Tomb Raider in anticipation for what it will have to offer.   What's good about it:  Rich story with enough variety in gameplay to let you decide whether you want to be stealthy or just go all out guns blazing. There is a feeling of character development and progression and your character is not the same Tomb Raider she was when she first started. The graphics are on point, and the game excels in bringing you into the story, as if it is your story.   What's bad about it:  Because there is a story to follow, I understand why the game is linear. Everyone loves open world, but this is essentially the story of Lara Croft so it's expected that they do some funnelling towards a particular path. I believe multiplayer is probably where the game sort of falls off. I would have much rather had more to the core of the game and story than a PVP mode which just seems completely out of place.  In an industry dominated by male protagonists, I think Lara is badass and very refreshing. No superpowers, just raw skill and a great story. Not only does it fill a void in the industry, but it does it in great taste and quality.",

            "review_text": "Without any exaggeration, this is one the best games I've ever played. I never played any of the Tomb Raider games before, but this one is fantastic.   Gameplay is smooth and fun.  The game has a cover + shoot mechanic in it that works flawlessly. When there are enemies nearby, Lara immediately changes her stance to a combat stance. She will walk more stealthfully and automatically take cover behind walls when you approach them. There is no 'cover' or crouch button you need to worry about. Just walk up to a wall and she will assume a defensive position. She will also lean out of cover to allow you to shoot an enemy while still maintaining cover, all automatically. You don't need to press Q or E for instance. All of this is brilliantly smooth and fits right into the gameplay perfectly.   The graphics are beautiful.  I play the game in the highest settings for everything without any lag / fps drop whatsoever. With these settings, the entire game looks amazing. The outside scenery, the dark caves, and don't get me started on Lara's hair. With TressFX enabled, Lara's hair is the greatest hair I've ever seen in a video game currently at the time of typing this. It has individual strands of hair that flow through the wind, brush from off her back over her shoulder and down to her side. Jumping, turning quickly, any movement and the hair reacts realistcally. FYI, the screenshots Steam provides does not have TressFX enabled. It is a very noticeable difference. I suggest googling it if you don't know what I'm talking about. But even if you can't maintain a smooth framerate with it enabled, the game is still beautiful to look at with it disabled as well.   Upgrades, weapons and collectibles.  The upgrade system for weapons is, simply put, fun. You start off with mediocre, poor quality equipment. You're then able to collect salvage in your adventure and use it to mod your weapons. As further time progresses, you'll be able to completely upgrade the weapons you have into their next tier. The game also includes several bits of collectibles, mostly for completionists sake. Such as relics that give some backround history on ancient Japan culture, or various puzzle related locations that grant rewards. The game also offers a fast travel option to go back to any point of the game you were previously at. So you don't need to worry about missing out on any collectibles. You gain XP for nearly everything you do in the game, and with this XP you game skill points. Using skill points allows you to gain additional abilities whether it be better survival skills, or stronger in combat, you choose the way you want to go about it.  Not only is the gameplay and graphics great, but the story is great too. It keeps you wanting to play more and more and figure out the mystery the island holds.   There are many other reasons I could list as to why I recommend this game, but it isn't necessary to go on.  TL;DR, one of the best games ever played. Flawless combat with fun upgrading / weapon mod system. Amazing graphics and interesting storyline. Lara's hair.",

            "review_text": "This 2013 reboot re-envisages an ancient franchise as a high drama action-adventure with heavy third-person shooting and light puzzles, rather than a 3D puzzle platformer wherein you must sometimes shoot a tiger. Perhaps you would call that merely a change in emphasis, but it feels very different. Tomb Raider is a good romp and technically impressive, but despite the hype around the new design, the misogyny and normalization of violence in the main character are still present, and there are notable mechanical and racial problems. The delights for me are the collectibles and animations.  The main character is the thing. Lara is now a vulnerable freshman explorer, tagging along with a more experienced crew, who gets into serious trouble. She has been redesigned with humanoid proportions, and a lot to learn. The game shows her getting hurt a lot. Much is made of her vulnerability, but even grievous wounds are quickly shaken off, and after an hour or so she is slaughtering men by the dozen. She soon becomes much the same hardened murderer as so many other game protagonists. Her in-game barks ('Run, you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!', 'I'm coming for you!') evoke a bloodthirst at odds with the storyline of an innocent young woman doing her best at a time of crisis.  I found the original series hard to play because Lara was designed and exploited to titillate a certain demographic. The new Lara has an actual human body. She is still normatively pretty, and thin, with very large breasts. Some people look like this, but ultimately, games over-represent these bodies to pander to the male gaze of their perceived audience. I think the most generous thing I can say is that Lara is desexualized relative to her previous incarnation, but still recognizable. And there is another form of misogyny at play here too. A friend of mine put it that the player is encouraged to want to protect this young girl. There are a great many gruesome death animations for Lara, and the danger she is put in is frighteningly sexualized at the beginning of the game. The enemies are all men. In fact, there are only three female NPCs, and one of them has no lines. For me, this is only a partly successful reboot, and largely for these reasons.  Raiding tombs is now an optional side quest. Each tomb is a single room puzzle with a chest at the end. I enjoyed these deviations from the main narrative, but I was disappointed that the chests contain nondescript treasures. When Lara gasps and grabs one, we aren't shown what it is. I think this was a missed opportunity. Elsewhere in the game, there are dozens of 'relics': artifacts from centuries of Japanese history, modern tchotchkes, and mementos from World War 2. They are well-rendered, beautiful objects, and they inspire interest in real archaeology. Finding these relics and hearing Lara's commentary on each one was my favourite part of Tomb Raider. I wish the tombs had been integrated into that mechanic, but I recognize that the mechanics of a project on this scale are developed separately, in parallel. Unfortunately, when turning over relics, Lara serially mispronounces 'Edo': unbelievable for a professional academic working on location in Japan. But the relics help to illustrate what is best about this game: amazing production values. It just looks a treat. There are animations for every little thing. Even the way Lara flicks water from her forearm when drying off is perfect. The textures are lovely, even if they can be a little gamey. Whole buildings and setpieces are lovingly put together, and then only seen once, for a few seconds. In short, you can feel every cent of the one hundred million dollar budget spent on this game.  Platforming feels good. It's forgiving and intuitive. Lara's jump is quite floaty, but it doesn't feel silly. I generally felt like I had 'just made it' through action sequences, and only had to replay a couple of sections.  The gunplay is standard non-technical third person cover shooter fare. I thought it was fine, but I would rather have done less of it. You can upgrade weapons, but the process feels a bit distant and automatic. There are a lot of Quick-Time Events (QTEs; essentially abstractions during which you are prompted to press a button to simulate having Lara react quickly to a dramatic situation), but never for things which really matter. I lost track of the number of times I had to press X to catch a ledge during a cut-scene, just for the ledge to collapse, but I wasn't involved at all when Lara treated her own wounds, upgraded her weapons, cremated her mentor, or put herself in danger to save her best friend.  A lot of white men made this game, and it shows. At the end, we're shown photographs of the Crystal Dynamics crew. 90% of them, including the senior staff, are white and male. They clearly worked hard, and it's great to see people of colour in the main cast, but there's also a lot wrong. The game is set on an island off Japan, but the antagonist and protagonist (Matthias and Lara) are white. The only Japanese character who is actually alive is Japanese-American. Jonah, a Polynesian cook and sailor, is one of the few people Lara can rely on, but he is painted as a kind of 'mystical person of colour', with an unexplained sixth sense about the spiritual forces at work on the island. Reyes, the ship's mechanic, is another likeable ally, and one of the very few named black characters, but has been fleshed out with a predictable subplot about being a hardass single black mom with a missing baby-daddy.  About three quarters of the way through, there's a miniboss battle with a very large black man. The framing of that fight, with tiny, white Lara swearing at him, and brutalising his body, implicitly draws on centuries of racist caricature. There are no other boss encounters except at the very end, so the depiction really stands out.  The single-player campaign is about eleven hours long. Collecting all of the trinkets may take another six or seven hours. The multiplayer mode doesn't really interest me. It consists of fairly standard team-based shooter objectives on small maps.  Tomb Raider (2013) is no feminist reworking, but the criticisms of it as exploitative have been overstated. In this game, Lara is not sexually assaulted, so far as I can tell, although many seem to have drawn that conclusion. I cannot recommend this game to everyone, because not everyone has the time and energy for hours of shooting, and it is very bleak and violent at times. But if you want big action, and you want to see how pretty a game can look, you can do a lot worse. Just understand what it isn't.",

            "review_text": "Before you read this, please note that I didn't finish the game yet. According to the load-page, I am about 30% through, and have been playing for four hours so far. I am not quite sure whether that means that the main story gives you about 12 - 13 hours of playtime, but that's my stat right now.   I have been playing several TR titles, starting with the very first one on the PS1, back in the 90s. It's obvious that things have progressed a lot, but even though the char and series have gone through a lotta changes, and even though this is kind of a rebooted prequel, there definitely IS some 'Lara-ness' to the main character in this game... and it's not only the voice-acting.  That's actually a nice segue, because the voice-acting especially for Lara is outstanding. It is well-acted, and very well brings over the pain, fear, loss, confusion and anger that Lara goes through during the story.  And there is a LOT of that. I don't think I ever have 'worried' so much about Lara, as she suffers a LOT in this game. She is not the smirking, cool and tough Lara we know from some of the other games, she is teenage Lara here, and the situation has her on the verge to plain panic most of the time.  This might annoy some people. In my case, it kinda kept me on the edge of my seat, because... I felt 'pinched'. You kinda feel for Lara and all the suffering, and you want her to survive.  This game is pretty hard-edge, not only because of all the pain she has to endure. There are some scenes which definitely are not fit for children (a certain tunnel in the secluded monastery being the prime example, with body parts everywhere).   The graphics are breathtaking, especially during one of the key-scenes of the game, where you have to climb a high building. That scene has one of the best examples of conveying the feeling of being high up in the air, climbing up carefully... quite fascinating.   Now, I have read several reviews saying that especially at first, there'd be a lot of 'cutscenes' and quicktime events. Now, I am 30% and 4 hours in, and I did not notice a change... there STILL are a lot of those scenes. Lara talking on the walkie talkie, plus sudden quicktime events where you have to follow the commands on the screen or dodge objects.  These can be VERY frustrating at first. A lot of times, good reaction isn't enough. You lose all orientation, and you have maybe a sec or two to find out what you're supposed to do while the floor around you breaks apart. While this might be pretty...realistic, it sometimes feels less than fair. There is one scene in particular, again at that monastery, where it took me several tries to even find out where I am to go and how, and I kept dieing a lot.   Same is true for the 'move at high speed and dodge objects that will instantly kill you' quicktime events. While some of them, I was able to survive on the first attempt, some of them have to be 'learned' (as in, memorize the order of obstacles or directions you have to move in), and that isn't always fun. Especially when a) the lighting is so bad you can only GUESS where the killing object is or b) Lara's body is in the way, obstructing your view, making it harder.  Those events are the least fun part for me, even though I guess they're realistic (if you were in a similar situation, you'd have to think quickly or even have to rely on luck to survive). I guess dieing is just something you need to get used to and accept in order to 'learn' those events.   The FPS part is pretty fun. You can improve and pick your weapons, so if sometimes, you feel like blasting away enemies with a shotgun instead of assassinating them with your bow, you can. However, in some cases, one of these methods is much more recommended. I found myself using all available weapons at a healthy balance, depending on the situation...sometimes being sneaky and acting like a sniper, sometimes going by brute force.   Controls are decent. The dodging-mechanics can be a bit off (hold shift while moving in a certain direction), but otherwise, I found them to be easy to understand and learn.   So, in a nutshell:   Pros: + Very nice graphics and cutscenes + Lara is a VERY likeable character, the character progression throughout the story is nicely done, graphics rock.  + Controls, apart from the dodging (YMMV!) are good + Soundtrack, voice acting + Scary atmosphere, and you might start to really care about Lara and the pain she suffers through + Fun weapon mechanics, and unless the game forces you to use a certain weapon, you can use different tactics  Cons - While the cutscenes sometimes are very dramatic and exiting, they can be frustrating unless you accept you will die several times while learning them - A LOT of cut scenes and quicktime events, to a point where sometimes, it feels like 'play for a minute, watch 2 minutes of cutscenes', or some interactice movie where you do a few things and then watch for a while what happens next  YMMV-category - A bit of gore and tough scenes, not safe for children. Depends on whether you like that or can tolerate it - I haven't tried all the difficulty modes, but ammo is never really a concern. You will find ammo and salvage (to modify weapons) pretty much everywhere. Even with the talents that increase the amount of ammo I can carry, I often had to leave behind stacks of ammo because I simply couldnt carry any more. This might bother some people, as a lot of times, you can just wildly shoot at enemies, not much need to save up on ammo.   Rating: I'd give this a solid 8/10. Sometimes it feels too much like an interactive movie, with too many events where you just watch. However, the game is a ton of fun, it's interesting to watch the story, watch Lara grow, try different tactics.  Less 'free' than some older TRs, but to me, a REALLY good addition to the franchise.",

            "review_text": "Excellent reboot with beautiful cut scenes and an engaging story. The gameplay is easy to latch onto and the environments are fun to explore. One thing to note is that the tombs in this game, which include a lot of puzzles, are optional. So keep that in mind. Meaning if you don't go out searching for tombs and just continue with the story then that's perfectly alright.  Personally I love having it be optional because I loved the old Tomb Raider games for their stories, the puzzles were fine too and I'm glad they're still included but I like that it doesn't affect your gameplay by a lot. I'd defeinitely recommend this for anyone looking for a game with lots of exploration, shoot 'em up, and treasure hunting.   One thing I loved the most about the game is how much story is hidden just everywhere. Tiny artifacts Lara examines and tells you the backstory of, journal entries read aloud via different voice actors, and idle dialogue between hostile npcs while you sneak up on them. There's just so much to know and explore in this game I definitely want more games like this with Lara and Sam. I get that by the ending Sam may not want to be an adventurer but that doesn't mean she couldn't help Lara in the following games with tech stuff or connections. Maybe aphone call or something? They seem so close I was almost certain they were more than friends. I'd love to see that more in the future games. Even if its just their friendship or a cameo photo or voice mail to Lara.",

Camilla Luddington is a good voice actor in this, and plays the new Lara well, as the nervous and unsure character that is unfamiliar to the series' setting. The story is also great, with the Yamantau environment providing a gritty feel to the game, and the shipwrecks are also kinda cool. You can also greatly upgrade your weapons throughout the game, which makes bad weapons like the bow good towards the end.  I only have two criticisms of TR: the collectables, and the multiplayer. I like collecting collectables in games (no matter how many), but the variation in location on TR is kinda annoying, as there is no indication of height of the object from ground level (as many things like shrines are on cliff faces) or any vague location as to where they are on the map. The other more prominent criticism is of multiplayer. I like whoring achievements, of which I have some left on TR to get. Unfortunately, I cannot get these, as TR is one of those games that lots of people play, but only single player. I have never had the opportunity to play MP as a result, which is a shame.  Overall, a great story and character, but wish that I had been a few years earlier with MP, or that it had at least lasted longer.  7/10",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider is a reboot of the original classic. I remember when the first Tomb Raider came out, it was one of the first games to actually have a demo you could play before buying it. I enjoyed the original, but I always felt it was too puzzle heavy, not enough action. Back then the technology just wasn't there to create a game worthy of the vision. Now, with the new reboot, Tomb Raider has become what it was meant to be all along.  They've managed to expand on all of the various elements of the original without being too heavy handed in one area. Tomb Raider is all action. FPS is satisfying with plenty of depth. Action is insane with death defying stunts at heights you have to see to believe. Puzzles are frequent and make you think, as they should. Level design is so good that it makes a somewhat linear game feel like it's not. Graphic design elements successfully mask the linear nature of the game. The music immerses you in the action and is so good it sounds like it came from a blockbuster movie; huge props to the music team.  Raiding tombs is probably the weakest element. You find many unique items from different eras, but the sense of finding priceless treasure is lost as soon as you find out what it is and it gets stuffed in your pocket.  If you're afraid of heights, you may find this game hard to get through. Normally, games don't bother me, but Tomb Raider has you so high in the air you're on the edge of your seat when you jump onto a zip line or leap with blind faith that you'll be able to grab the ledge or bury your axe into the sheer rock face. The action will clean out your arteries nicely.  FPS gameplay can be difficult at times, especially in the tougher battles (and there are quite a few), but it's well-balanced and addictive. I especially enjoy the ability to switch hands and shoot around corners and obstacles from the left or the right. You can easily get your stealth fix by silently taking out enemies with arrows or up close and personal. It feels balanced for multiplayer (which I haven't tried), which shows they put a lot of thought into it.  I consider this game to be a masterpiece. So many people went above and beyond to make this game into something excellent. So many areas of the game could've been less than stellar had someone not gone the extra mile to make it the best they could. It really shows that the whole team cared a lot about the franchise.  Also keep in mind that this, the first game in the reboot, was meant to show how Lara came into her own as an adventurer, where it began. There are nods to the original and you get to see where she got the two pistols from, etc. It's done in a subtle way, so as to tie in the original and bring in the new direction at the same time.  Some people might look at this game and compare it to the nostalgia they have for the original and come up wanting in some areas, but this is a new direction for the franchise and I do think it's the right one as it does every element of what we would expect from the franchise so much better. It's an awesome game.  I can't wait to see what they do next with Tomb Raider. At the time of this writing, the second game is out. I'm definitely going to buy it. Shut up and take my money!",

Damn i wasnt even interested in this one ( just the old tombraider games where never my type of game back in the day) I originally bought this for my wife who if a big tomb raider fan.  Now my wife has only played about an hour or 2 of this, and then i wanted to give the game a try and well 18hours later im still playing it and loveing it, cant get enough. Even went out of my ay to get ahold of the original trilogy as well.    I love the metroidvainia style of this game. i love how large the map is ansd how much exploring you can get done without following the story.  my biggest gripe with this game is the QTE's theres a few to many that makes it annoying but thats not the biggest problem i have, i keep forgetting that the ! means to press f and the hand means press e. granted it says it at the bottom but when you have less than half a second to react i would of been nicer if it just showed the key to press instead of the ! and hand crap it does  overall i highly reccomend this game even if you're not a fan of tomb raider i promise you this will change your mind  9/10",

This is a game about a teenager that is thrown in an island where everyone wants her dead and she has to strive to survive.  Even though I enjoyed the game, I really hated the constant whinning of Lara through the game and the fact that there were so many scripted missed jumps where you try to jump and skips to what is essentially a cutscene of you falling and ending up in a completly different area. This is everything videogames are not, failing a jump because you are supposed to and not because you did it wrong has no point.  One thing that is really good about this game and saves it from the garbage bin is how well the story is told through exposition but more importantly through the symbology.

Fortunately, the gamer in me was pleased with almost everything else. The combat is a drastic improvement on previous games, mainly because the player has to use their own skill to aim, rather than just locking on targets. The 10 hours long story is fantastic, and the voice acting is superb, providing cutscenes with appropriate emotional weight. I found most characters likeable, especially Lara and her more vulnerable personality. The QTEs can be annoying, especially when you sometimes only get about a second to hit the correct key before death.

You play as a young Lara Croft, in the adventure that starts her tomb raiding career, fighting your way through an island controlled by a cult worshiping an ancient queen that could control the weather. Though the game does have some wonderful graphics, it can be a bit glitchy at times; such as when you kill a couple enemies and their bodies vanish before your eyes. The only major downside of the game is that the camera loves to fight you. Be it by being on the wrong side when aiming half the time, turning when trying to jump which leaves poor Lara arcing past a ledge and falling to her death, or turning to face Lara when nearing the top of a climb instead of staying behind her to give you a view of the dozen cultists waiting to ram their machette into her throat. You will probably die more often to poor camera work than anything else in this game. I will note that the poor camera work is pretty much par for the course for a 3rd person action-adventure game, and this is not even close to the worst I've seen *cough*DevilMayCry2*cough*, so it can be overcome fairly easily. It seems to be just about the right length for an action-adventure game, not long, but not really short either, and if you are going to 100% completion you can probably expect to spend around 20 hours playing. The world is also one of the more beautiful I've seen in a game so far.

They have worked very hard to bring us a cinematic experience, giving us gorgeous and detailed environments, blending cut scenes with urgent platforming, fast-paced action along with a touch of sandbox roaming. It is clearly a labour of love, and I have enjoyed hours hunting down every item, finding every document and completing every challenge. If you have to resort to guides to do any of this, or to solve any of the puzzles, then you are not really trying very hard!  You do have to work at suspending your disbelief, though, when Lara survives the most outrageous falls and explosions without any broken bones, and sticks the most unlikeliest of jumps ...and Lara grunts continuously, even when standing still.  All of this is good clean, violent fun, though. Now, here are my gripes:   Camera ---------------------- I was continually wrestling for control of the camera. I don't need the game telling me where I should be looking, I can manage all by myself, thankyou.  Button-mashing ---------------------- As an adult, I don't want to be button-mashing. Seriously: you can leave that for the kiddies' games. I don't know any adult who wants to be furiously pounding their keyboards.   Quicktime Events ---------------------- And, we've got quick-time events. This wasn't fun with the ancient Dragon's Lair in 1983 (so I am told). It certainly isn't fun now.  Scripted Events ---------------------- The game is linear and it is scripted in parts. It doesn't matter if you have been playing a certain style, because the game is going to make you do these scenes the way it wants you to. This breaks immersion. I would prefer to do it my way. You can see why the devs have done this, though. Mostly these scenes really do work, and give the game the action blockbuster feel the devs were seeking, and when you play these through flawlessly, it really is exhilarating.  Tomb Raider is a good game. I do hope the devs have put in telematics into this game so that they can see what they should do more of and what they should avoid next time, because one thing's for sure: I will be playing the sequel.  8/10 (single player PC)",

And oh, how far away those days seem at the start of Tomb Raider (the new one, not the old one, because names and numbers are hard). This new Tomb Tomb Raider no longer has a badass Lara, but rather a whiny, weak and constantly crying Lara, and here is where the downhill starts (big word coming up): ludonarrative dissonance.  Here's an example on than and the reason why I give the story such a low score:  8 hours into the game Lara opens a door. Behind the door are fifteen burly men with floodlights, sandbags, shotguns and submachineguns all pointing at Lara. Lara then proceeds to massacre these would-be ambushers without comment.  12 hours into the game Lara is in a room with a friend of hers and several enemies are approaching. 'Leave me, Lara, you can't take them!' -the friend says, and Lara turns away and just ♥♥♥♥ing LEAVES! Oh and then she cries some more, because women apparently do that a lot. I shouted bloody murder at my monitor.  Other than the broken story, Tomb Tomb Raider is actually a pretty cool game. All but one of the Tombs in Tomb Tomb Raider are optional for some reason, but at least they're there. Gunplay is okay, enemy AI is fine and the overarching story is interesting enough even with the bawling protagonist breaking down immersion every ten minutes. The game is also gorgeous. The splashing waters, the fluttering leaves, the tumbling ragdolls, all of them are well rendered and believable.

            "review_text": "I didn't know what to expect with this game, and to its credit, it took me a few hours to realize which game this is a clone of. Of course that's mostly because the first few hours are a little schizophrenic. There's about a thirty second intro (where Lara introduces her game with the cringe-inducingly generic line 'I went looking for adventure, but adventure found me') before you're immediately thrown into quicktime events. I guess they wanted to dump you into the action quickly to feel as lost and confused as Lara, but it was awkward and off-putting. I felt confused and emotionally uninvested. Then, one you're past the quicktime events it introduces the concept of hunting animals for food to survive, which makes it seem like it might be a survival based game (which actually sounded really cool), but that's really just a tutorial, you never have to shoot another animal again. Finally the gamesettles into thing and reveals that it's actually an Arkham Asylum clone.  I don't have anything against a game being a clone of another game and Tomb Raider is polished enough to be fun and uses cover-based shooter mechanics as its defining element over Arkham's brawling, so it feels like more than a straight rip-off, but it was never good enough for me to forget that I was playing a game that wasn't quite as good as Arkham Asylum. It tries to have stelthy sections interspersed with the action like AA, but your guns are so effective that it's all pointless. In Arkham Asylum the stealth sections put you at a disadvantage and you had to use your superior mobility to outwit the enemies. Sometimes in Timb Raider being stealthy can save you from having more enemies pop out, but there was never a point where I couldn't Rambo through every thing, even with the combat set to hard. It has the same exact pacing as AA where you'll a lternate between more linear areas and those that offer a little exploration, but Tomb Raider's open areas don't really lend themselves to the exploration as well as AA's. They have a more natural and less crafted feel to them, but at the same time it makes it a slog to look around for everything.  There are also too many sections that take control away from the player to try and simulate peril. In one section Lara has to shimmy her way up a crack in a mountain side. All the player has to do is hold up and she does all the work. Yeah, it looks like she's struggling and trying to avoid falling rocks, but there's absolutely no threat. Sometimes moments like that can work in a game, but when they fail, they're glaringly obvious.  Once the story actually begins to develop at a logical pace it'snot terrible. Lara's fellow castaways all fall into archetypes, but charmingly so rather than obnoxiously. It goes for the hollywood action blockbuster approach rather then the slower paced survial thriller it feel like at first. There are silly moments that don't fit in with the gameplay, for example the game makes a big deal of the first guy you kill, as if Lara is traumatized, but fifteen minutes later, you're sneaking up behind enemies and choking them to death like it's no big deal. There's a moment late in the game where you get a grenade launcher and Lara starts busting ♥♥♥ like she's some avenging angel. It's clearly supposed to be a major moment in the storyline, but I was running through so many enemies early on that it just felt like I was doing the same thing I'd been doing all along.  In any case the game's pretty, the gunplays solid, it's neat to discover tombs (even though most of the item collection is just picking up ♥♥♥♥ that's lying around). I'd recommend Arkham Asylum before this game if you haven't played it already, but Tomb Raider a'int too shabby if you can find a good sale price.",

You play as Lara Croft, an adventurer, a cute adventurer in a tank top might I add, who persuades the crew of the Endurance, a ship, to go search for an island thought to be home of an ancient civilization. You can probably guess, something very terrible occurs.   It is very much a 3D puzzle platformer (if that is even a thing) and requires you to go around to find your friends while searching for relics along the way. The platforming and gameplay style is very similar to that of the Uncharted series so you can jump and climb on anything marked to do so. I would go as far to say that they are literally the exact same but with a different story and characters. Voice acting is fantastic as is the detail (or as 'Total Biscuit' often says, the 'graphical fidelity.') Anything you see and hear was done very well and you can tell there was plenty of effort put into this. Though linear, the story is easy to follow.   Of the few bad things, only few need mention. The first is realism. Somewhere along the lines, Square Enix believed that Lara Croft is able to keep going on her adventure after sustaining tons of injuries, some being critical. For a girl of that size and stature, there is no way she would be able to keep going after all of that.   Second is the quick time events. There are a few scattered quick time events in this game which can be quite annoying. They're rather easy and quick, but that's not the problem. The frustrating part is *when* they occur; they come at unexpected intervals during the gameplay or during a cutscene. One second you're sitting there watching, the next moment you're being told to press a button within 1-2 seconds. It's way too quick.  Third problem, which is a major flaw is the multiplayer. I cannot even explain how ♥♥♥♥ this multiplayer is. This is genuinely one of the worst MP experiences I have ever had, and with good reason. It's laggy. It automatically starts with voice chat enabled by default and many people don't realize it's on so you can hear them all game. The maps are usually one-sided and just have a bad layout. Think of this as a single player 'play' on a crappy map where enemies are controlled by real people. On top of all of that, multiplayer is dead. You have to wait at least 10 minutes to get into a good game with other players. It's a good thing people don't buy this game for the multiplayer experience because it would be a huge letdown.   Aside from the multiplayer, Tomb Raider is worth every penny.   Controller not supported (even with x360ce), even though it says it is. Mouse and keyboard is actually much better anyways.  TL;DR: Play as Lara Croft, a girl who wears a tank top all game and is immortal to injuries, in an Uncharted clone on the PC. Quick time events happen. Multiplayer is absolute ♥♥♥♥.

NO. To easy i made it threw every puzzel in at least under 3 minutes unless it involved timing. Now i would not know if this is just a thing for me or if everyone went with this.

            "review_text": "There are a bunch of things I hate, and among them are games containing QTEs and jumping puzzles. I can't play some of the most popular platform games just because of jumping puzzles. Tomb Raider is a game primarily about QTEs and jumping puzzles, and yet I love it. Why is this? I don't actually know, but I have some guesses.  First: The actual jumping is pretty forgiving. In fact the control mechanics, animations and graphics are so fluid that there's rarely any guesswork involved in deciding, for example, if a particular jump is within reach. Evaluating your surroundings and making your way through them is more spatial puzzle than twitch reaction test. The result is a world that's a pleasure rather than a frustration to move about in. It's hard for me to say with any authority, but it feels like this is rare in a game in this genre.  Second: The QTEs are not great, but they're not terribly frequent and they make a certain amount of sense in context. In short - not a stellar achievement in QTE, but easy enough to overlook even if you're not a fan.  Third: The level design and graphics and just everything else about the game. It looks gorgeous, it's fun to explore and the controls are fantastic. I even went out and found most of the collectibles, not out of any completionist compulsion but because it was fun to get to them.  Fourth: Lara is both human and a superhuman badass, and you're vicariously both of those things through her. You can feel and share her fear, pain, excitement, awe, exhaustion, anger, relief - even as she displays complete disregard for gravity and the limits of human endurance.  The obligatory con(s): The shooty bits are a little meh. I didn't like that enemies popped in to areas only when you were nearby, even if you could have sniped them from further away. I can understand why they did that, but it felt like a regression from other recent shooters that support stealthy sniping even if not outright encouraging it.  2) A minor nitpick: If you're relatively observant and obsessively collecting journal entries, you're going to work out what's happening quite a lot sooner than Lara does. It then gets a bit much listening to her wonder about things that she should already have figured out.  3) Don't ever let her into your house. She will wreck it, then burn it to the ground.",

It's a very cinematic experience, which could be a slight turn off for some due to the high level of QTE's, but I found them to work well almost all the time. The fighting is brutal and fun and there are a few nice, but not very difficult, puzzles interspersed with the action which helps its pacing. I often find the motivation to do something in games is not very clearly expressed through the story, but with Tomb Raider I never got that feeling. I always knew why or where I was going and it all wrapped in a pleasing manner. It helped that Lara was a believable and likeable character, who got scared, surprised and angry in a way that made you believe the often outrageous scenarios presented to you throughout the game. If there is anything that was a bit off I'd have to say it was the hunting. It's presented initially like it's a big part of the game, but it's clear later on that it's completely unnecessary. Luckily it doesn't detract from the rest of the game, so you can safely ignore it without ruining the rest of the experience. Overall it is a surprisingly fun game and certainly worth your time to play.",

Well, it's okay. The game is beautiful and I did enjoy the puzzles and the shooty bits. However, I didn't really feel a connection with any of the characters and didn't really care what happened to them. Including Lara. Once you've seen someone stabbed through the stomach with a pencil, and then proceed to leap around a forest, you kind of lose the ability to relate to them! Also I found the actual tomb raiding felt out of place. She's running around an island trying to escape, facing death at every turn and then she's like 'Ooh, isn't this Ming vase exquisite!' There are also far too many quick time events. I'm playing this game for fun! Quick time events are not fun! Doesn't everyone know that? And oh my gosh, no more moving left and right to avoid objects sequences please, they are also not fun, and haven't been fun since the 1980s.

The graphics and well written plot are ruined with the almost impossible maneuvering skills you're allowed in 'emergencies.' It also fails to register when you 'mash' a button. Falling off a cliff? Press e to save Lara. What's that? I'm sorry, you fall to your death because the game doesn't recognize that you pressed e a million times to save Lara. So you're stuck there dying numerous times because the game does not realize that you are doing what it tells you. You have to 'mash e' for stupid tasks like opening doors and if you don't do it quick enough(which gets tiring after a few times of it not recognizing you're mashing e) the meter it has just drops and you have to start all over. You're also a lot slower than the enemies chasing you so you die a lot from that, as well. Which brings me to another point of how the game likes to show various graphic ways of Lara dying if you don't do something correctly. There is a river scene where you have to shoot at blocks to get rid of them but also avoid piles of rubble which conveniently have sharp sticks in them, which impale Lara if you don't avoid them, which, again, is hard to do because a.) You can't see them. and b.) the reaction time is slow when you try to move Lara out of the way. It'll just frustrate you. I consider myself a very patient person but this game just completely tore that down. I definitely don't recommend this game.

If you were expecting strong character development in, I don't know, the only important character in the entire game, Lara, then you've come to the wrong place. In the start of the game, Lara breaks down over killing one or two people but in no time she's on her way to massacring literally hundreds of people throughout the rest of the game (unloading an assault rifle into their chest or jamming her ice pick into their skull, you name it). Lara also gets stranded on the island with a bunch of other people who I can't be bothered to remember their names for, only two or so of which are actually significant in the game, and only two of which I actually cared slightly about (other than Lara).   Parts of the game are somewhat open to exploration, but there really isn't much to find. There are occasional 'optional' tombs which require you to solve an easy peasy puzzle to get a handful of xp. Speaking of puzzles, don't expect to find any particularly hard ones in this game because nearly all of them are childs play.   In terms of combat, there are some areas where you need to use stealth but in most cases, it isn't very viable, some areas just force you into combat and you have no option to use stealth. Stealth is slightly important in the beginning of the game but as you progress, Lara can get upgrades that basically make her a tank, so you can (and will need to) go full rambo in some sections of the game.   Finally, there are a few things that really bug me about the game. There are a few bosses which can only be killed by completing quick time events (did I mention there are a LOT of them?), so despite me pumping thousands of assault rifle rounds into their exposed, fleshy head, they can only be killed if I hit them in the face with my pick. Lara's deaths are pretty brutal and this bothered me a lot. I understand what they were trying to go for, but after the first few deaths it really just got more annoying than shocking.   Basically, I don't recommend this game because it really isn't that fun and it also happens to do an extremely poor job of developing Lara's character.",

I've gotta say that it's a major league improvement over any of the past titles in the series by leaps and bounds. Lara quite literally gets beat to pieces in this one and you get to actually see and experience each and every bit of that along the way. I've gotta tell you--it gets very brutal in some places if you aren't used to violence in games by now. She wades through muck, mire, and even blood at one point all while gathering bits of it all over her since that would naturally happen to anyone else if placed in those real-life environments. And about those environments: they are pain-stakingly beautiful and rich--even if some were a bit too gruesome for my taste.  The puzzles in this game are interesting but once you get used to solving them they actually get quite predictable since there's only so many ways to present the same thing over and over again. I even found myself locating all of the treasures and relics along the way the first time through the game--instead of backtracking over previously explored territory (was I supposed to do that?). Probably the most frustrating aspect of the game is the quick-action events (or whatever the game called them, ugh) that often end up punishing you with some brutal death-scene rather than allowing you any adequate amount of time to accomplish anything. So, you end up repeating a short section of the game until you get it just right.  All in all this is a much-needed step in the right direction for the Lara Croft/Tomb Raider series and I hope she has many more successful games in this franchise left in her before she sees retirement! ;-p",

I'm just joking!  Story wise this game is pretty nice, but predictable.   Uh oh we crashed on a island and now we need to get help. Mysterious storm makes plane crash? Wat is goin o-...oh wait its the sun queen, she is vengeful bleh bleh bleh   It is however a pretty long story and took me about 12 hours on the hardest difficulty to complete it.  Controls are pretty good, but I wish I could change normal and fire arrows/shells without having to use the number keys. I prefer all weapon changing options bounded to the mouse wheel but...you know what I'll shutup since I'm being bias now.  Graphics for the year it released are good, and when maxed out this game can put a hurting on your system. I just leave things like Tesselation and TressFX off though, I prefer 60+ FPS at all times. They did a great job of porting this too, it is very well optimized in a sense that your GPU is tested through thick and thin, while the CPU won't make too much of a difference.  Gameplay isn't very unique, but that doesn't mean it's not fun. The bow and the rope system are pretty cool, along with the use of the things like the rope pulley thingy-that-I-cannot-remember-the-name-of.   Replayability isn't very long, as you can usually find half of the stuff in one area while doing the story. After playing for 24 hours I have a 100% completed save game. There are a few achievements that mostly require you to start a new game so maybe you can get some fun out of doing that.  Multiplayer I won't go over much, I've only done two 1vs1 matches with a friend, and I've never been a fan of third person multiplayer. I was kinda hoping you start the game with a bow and weapons are scattered on the map and such but nope...they added the old and overused loadout system that has been around since 2007 with CoD4 (CoD4 is still a good game by my standards).  So, my overall verdict is that you should probably look into playing/buying this game, even at the $20 pricetag. If you're patience enough, you can wait for a steam sale and save some money but honestly, if I knew this game was as good as it is, I wouldn't have mind pre ordering it. ",

I just see it as she got put in the standard fight or flight scenerio and she came to the conclusion vary quickly if she dosn't kill them they will kill her. I ran into a few bugs but none of them were reacurring or anthing. I fell out of the map once and fell through a ledge i was jumping for but only happened those two times.

But this doesn't change the fact that not only is this a great and entertaining game, it is also the first Tomb Raider that made me see Lara as more than a pair of polygonal boobs doing stuff. For the first time I actually felt that she was a full-fledged character, not a mere game-mechanism or worse still a caricature. Fans of the original game's sense of exploration shouldn't be disappointed either. The game may take place in just one island but the areas you will find yourself in are nothing short of stunning.   If there is one thing to complain about, it is the dissonance between the player's actions and Lara's feelings. Lara is portrayed as green, struggling to place her life above those of her assailants and visibly tormented the first time she has to kill a person. At the same time, the player is encouraged to employ increasingly ruthless tactics and kill with abandon. It just doesn't sit right. Also I suppose the multiplayer experience is, I guess, a bit underwhelming. If it matters to you, its another thing to consider. Personally I'm not interested in multiplayer, so for me this doesn't change all that much.  All in all, this is a great game. And it's highly recommended.",

It's a survival/action/puzzle/mystery adventure, mostly. Looks incredible on Ultimate settings. Hair! Finally someone makes a game out of all the modern 3D tech. +1 for Canadians :)  Pros: polished and immersive cinematic experience; the game world feels alive with movement and details; beautiful vistas and locations; storytelling and plot rather than back-story; stealth plays a role in combat; no quest log or map following.  Cons: press button to live; not a lot of actual puzzles; items and ammo are pickups instead of scrounged - gameplay is not survival-based even though the plot is; stealth isn't as important as it seems; not an open world; achievements do not fit the story.  It's a shame, but in an effort to make the game have the widest possible appeal, most of the actual gameplay and difficulty have been toned down or replaced with timed button presses. Still, if this kind of game encourages more cinematic immersion and more storytelling in games, it's worth supporting and well worth playing as it stands.

These are the moments I always want in games but seldom experience…when Gordon picked up the super gravity gun and went OFF…when Commander Shepard walked the line at the end of ME2…when Shoeless Joe Jackson tells Ray Kinsella “Build it and HE will come” (sorry…not a game). At some point half-way through I really started to care about Lara Croft. I stopped analyzing the game for its merits and started playing it enthusiastically. So much so that when I knew I was on the last quest I stopped and went back to all my previous locations to pick up any remaining things because I wanted to prolong the experience…not “level up”. That should tell you something.  The game really isn’t that hard, the puzzles are not complicated, the side missions and searches for 'stuff' are not totally integral to the story...but I was having so much fun I finished all the core mission’s w/100% of the non-essential stuff I had to find. I spent hours looking for mushrooms, flags, and Buddha’s. It really was that good (far better than mining planets in ME2). I identified with the physical locations in the game (remote island w/lots of Japanese WW2 stuff in it), I identified with the hero in a way I haven't since Portal 2 and Mass Effect 2, and I thought the voice acting was excellent. Even though your compatriots don’t do much but die (in solid QT sequences), they add to the sense that Lara is in way over her head and maybe somewhat out of her head. Tomb Raider was the most enjoyable game I've played in a long time. Although technically a reboot, this is an entirely original game that should appeal to anyone. The level design was original and very vertical, some of the QT sequences are totally implausible but incredibly fun, there’s a LOT of gore early on (and in some of the later missions), and although the story is only slightly above average…it’s told exceptionally well.  In a nutshell…best gaming experience for me since Mass Effect 2 and Portal 2.   Notes: Most if not all the technical issues at start have been corrected with updates and new video drivers. The much vautned TRESSFX hair effect is, more or less, a foo-foo add to get you to run their benchmark...but it is a cool mini-benchmark and you owe it to yourself to try it (if for anything else than to see your gaming rig crawl to 16fps or slower at max settings).",

The game has a nice exploration feel to it. The puzzles are nice, particularly the tombs.  My only real complaint is the quick time events. They aren't fun. They are interspersed in the gameplay and in cutscenes, there's no way of knowing when it's gonna happen, and, I don't know what it's like on consoles, but on PC the key that you have to press in order to not die seems to change depending on the event. It doesn't add anything, it just serves to kill you once and make you watch the cut scene again. It's a particular problem at the start of the game in which it forms a major part of the gameplay, because a large part of the narrative is made up of short cutscenes. Stick with it and it does get better.  The multiplayer is pointless. It shouldn't have been added, but it does the game no harm by its presence.",

You can also dish out melee moves once they get real close and perform finishing moves based on the weapon you have out at the time. If your completionist like me, theres a lot of things to seek out and collect for 100% completion. Then there's the story. From the beginning you'll be sucked in by the mysterious actions of the island and will want to know more about what has been happening here. And from there it only becomes better.

The timeline for this installment of Tomb Raider dates back to when Lara was still the little adventurer with not a single drop of bad-♥♥♥ in her. The story was decently written with the ol' usual save-the-world theme, or rather this time is more of 'save my peeps and then myself'. It is an interesting story and it kept me wanting for more, the build-up was great and the direction it steered was indeed intriguing.  The characters was interesting and with enough effort to locate scattered documents in the world, made the characters even more so interesting as you get to learn their backstory.  The gameplay mechanics was quite good. I loved how the controls felt solid! The camera can be a little wonky at times, but forgiven as it does it's job most of the time.  The multiplayer mode is a little of a joke as an extension/game-life-extender. Though I can see the potential of it being interesting, but as like most single-player games made into multiplayer; it does not carry any true value for replayability.  The servers are mostly empty!  Overall, this game is an ace of a flying color and something to not miss out off if you're a fan for adventure or 3rd person action shooter. I am willing to give this game a rating of:  [4.5 / 5]  ::Rating legends:: 0 - Terrible, don't bother getting or even looking for it. 1 - Boring. Played only for the LoL of it. Not recommended to get 2 - Could have done a little better but was a snore to play it. Not recommended to get but may interest a particular party. 3 - Average. Pretty average game/story feel. Could have done better. No comments on acquiring, get if you want. 4 - Good. Had fun with it and would definitely recommend to get. 5 - Best game ever made, buy it and probably make love to it. (A rare rating to get)  Any ratings with a '.5' additional is basically a bonus to set it apart from its default to show how it's slightly better/more enjoyable.

Every time I have tried a Tomb Raider I have uninstalled the demo afther no more than 30 minutes, but this one is different. The things that did me quit before have been changed and improved: 1.- The camera is now stabile. It does´nt make me vomit anymore. 2.- More action, more shoting, more sneaking and killing bad men. Yes I wanted that. 3.- Survival instincts: A feature that shows you some tips with puzzles and the way to go. It is balanced now, in my humble opinion. Don´t forget, is the humble opinion of a 'no Lara fan'. I like puzzles, but not so much. I don´t be offended if I get some help wit them... and hell, I have not so many patience! I NEED some help with them!  This is overall a very nice game. I am sure that I will play it from start again. If you are a Lara fan, then you don´t need this review. If you tried before but did´nt like the same things I did´nt like, try this one.",

You may even occasionally attempt moving around during cutscenes as I did, or neglecting to move thinking you're still in the middle of one. There were only two or three hiccups to this.  Initially, for whatever reason, the TressFX quality setting for the hair was a bit buggy. Cutscenes in particular, as well as some regular gameplay, would see Lara's ponytail develop a mind of its own as it started flailing about without the presence of wind. This eventually went away, and I didn't have issues with it again.  The mechanics of the game are exceptionally easy to get used to and enjoyable. Storyline was greatly interesting, and the inclusion of random historical artifacts ranging anywhere from early A.D. to World War II era added that much more.  Plus, the unexpected deaths you suffer when you make a mistake are almost a source of enjoyment, as well as a bit of an 'Ooh, that had to hurt,' moment.  I'd highly recommend this, and not just to anyone that has played Tomb Raider in the past. I'm looking forward to future titles.",

            "review_text": "This isn't just a remake of the original Tomb Raider, it is a complete reimagining of the entire series. Fans of the original games may end up disappointed with the new direction. There is definitely more action and quick time events than a traditional platformer.   With that being said, the story focuses on the gritty origin story of Lara. You start off as a young and inexperienced Lara heading out for the first time on a grand adventure. You are quickly shipwrecked, beaten, bruised, stranded alone and traumatized within the first hour of the game. Equipped with a bow and a climbing pick, your goal is to recover the rest of the crew that you arrived with and to escape the island in one piece.  Basic gameplay is that of a traditional third-person shooter. You run around using cover and shooting around edges and corners to progress through fights. There is also the element of stealth that can be employed. If you are good with the bow and sneaking up behind people, you can stealth-kill your way through a vast majority of the game.  Some quick time events are fairly bland. The most common one is to press a single button repeatedly to open certain doors. Others are the typical 'press E at the right time or die' situations. They don't add much or detract too much from the overall experience. If you fail at one of the events, it'll put you right back into the action and give you another chance.  The greatest disappointment with the game is the multiplayer. It is a veritable ghost town and next to impossible to find a game except during peak hours. It is plagued with one-hit-kill mechanics that discourage newer people from giving it a second try after playing with more experienced people. It feels like it was tacked on at the last minute in spite of all the downloadable content and emphasis placed on it by the developers.   The visuals and graphics are absolutely breath-taking at times. So much so that it enhances the journey on the island to feel much more epic that it would have otherwise. This is an amazing game and well worth the price if you are willing to accept the new direction of the series.  ",

            "review_text": "I would first like to say that I'm a bit surprised how overwhelmingly positive the reviews are for this game. Reason is that I've played TR for many years and have played all of them up to this one. TR has a fairly large devoted following of not only diehard fans but purists. I say this as my favorite TR game is Angel of Darkness (AoD). Like this game, AoD was considered a TR reboot, in which the developer tried to add some new features to spice up the franchise and send it in a new direction. AoD was widely panned by both critics and players. The fans did not like the changes one bit, and I have to admit that some of them were a problem - mainly due to design issues and bugs. However, AoD is most definitely a true TR game with some of the best tomb raiding and puzzles in the series. Also, imo AoD is the most epic and challenging TR game with a great story. I think many players did not even finish it after the first, admittedly, somewhat cumbersome first couple of chapters.  With that said, the new Tomb Raider game here is quite good. The main issue is that actual tomb raiding is very very minimalized. Tombs basically consist of a handful of small caves with some fairly easy puzzles. I have yet played the newly released game after this one, but I suspect the lack of tomb raiding was by design. I believe the game was meant to be more of a pre-tomb raiding / origin story of the young Lara, where she gets her first tastes of tomb raiding. Hopefully, this aspect of the game becomes far more important to the series in the new and subsequent games. Ha..I mean the game is called Tomb Raider..and that is what Miss Lara is...  In addition to the Tomb Raiding factor, platforming, another important feature of the series in the past, is also under-utilized here. However, there's still quite a bit of it to be ok.  So, what makes this game good though is that it basically excels at all other aspects of the action-adventure genre. For one, you have a very nice story here. A story that really marries the setting to the plot and action. I'd say it's probably the best story in the TR series to date, especially as story and plot has not always been TR's calling card, so to speak. Combat here is quite fun, moderately challenging, and with decent AI, although not great AI for sure. Sometimes the AI kind of gets stuck in between spawn section running around like chickens with their head cut off. But still, it's pretty cool how the AI will take cover and throw grenades and molotovs at Lara. You can't always just hide behind cover and expect to safely pick off the enemies. And they will charge you too. The weapons are pretty cool, especially the bow. Also, the bow is used quite a bit for PvE stuff as well. Actually, I think it would be quite fun to try to play the game through completely using only the bow for combat as a challenge. Lastly, all technical aspects of the game are excellent from sound to visuals, and I encountered no bugs whatsoever.  So the point here, is that while Tomb Raider is by no means a typical Tomb Raider type game, it certainly classifies as a very good and entertaining action-adventure game. If you like the genre at all, you will like this one. Still, I hope to see more epic tomb raiding in the future of this series. I rate this 8/10.",

This isnt an action/adventure game, its an interctive movie where the highlight is pushing a button the game prompts you to push!, prompts and quicktime events do not a good game make!  It is so linar its painfull, the voice acting on some of the NPC's is a joke (Sam i'm talking about you mostly) and I dont think i've ever had motion sickness before from the camara during an ingame cutscene like I have in this game! Since i mentioned the camara, this is a 3rd person game, you look over Lara's shoulder so why in the hell does the game water leave droplets on the screen? I would expect it on a 1st person game where we look through their eyes but in a 3rd person game? all it does is get you irritated that you cant see propery and end up missing the quicktime calls that make up a majority of the gameplay features. Before anyone mentions, yes I know you can turn it off and I have, but I shouldnt have to mess about with it anyway, its just a gimick to make it look like they've made an effort with the graphics.  I like to turn on subtitles when playing games because sometimes the voice acting is to quiet, but in this game when you have it turned on, you get subtitles for the voices but they vanish after 0.6 seconds (exageration) so it can describe the bloody sound effects in the background. I want to know what is being said and I dont really care enouth about 2 NPC's cheering in the background to want a subtitle description of it.  And to make it worse, I know Lara is ment to be fresh in this game with no adventure experience at all, but holy hell in this game you play as the most pathetic sounding protaganist I've ever heard, she's whines and bit**es at every opertunity and when ever she comes up to a point of interest she says 'okay!' as if shes pumping herself up! Lara you've just climbed up a WWII aircraft hanging from a waterfall, why the hell do you need to pump yourself up to hop up a 6ft f***ing wall!.

            "review_text": "Definitely the best Tomb Raider in the entire series mostly due to how well the game develops Croft as a character. It starts out as, more or less, a survival game in which the re-imagined Croft, this time nothing more than a grad student, is shipwrecked on an island and has to fend for herself against the elements and a crazed group of cultists hunting her and her friends. Things eventually go off the rails from gritty, survival, game to balls to the wall, over the top, action, but it's a testament to the writers that no matter how absurd things get (and they do get absurd) or how many scores of mercenaries Croft ends up mowing down by the game's end, it's able to maintain an emotional core and vulnerability to the character that makes it not only believable in its own way, but uniquely captivating.  Plus, the developers definitely have good taste in B-Action films, judging from the direct references to 'Rambo 2' and, most effectively, 'The Descent.' Not just a scene involving a 'baptism' in a pool of blood is lifted directly from 'The Descent,' but whole portions of the game's general tone and 3 act structure (from survival, to character hardening, to revenge) are taken from the film. I usually dislike it when games crib too obviously from films, but 'Tomb Raider' handles its filmic influences incredibly well.   It has its flaws (It's a bit too long and probably should have ended sooner after the middle climax, as the game definitely slumps in its more conventional second half. Plus, I think the game pulls its punches one too many times when it comes to Lara's companions, none of whom are as well developed or interesting as she is. Honestly, they would have had more impact if they'd just been killed off in the first act), but at its best, it feels like playing a really awesome, forgotten, Grindhouse action film from the 1970s....which is the highest praise I could ever give to an action game.",

            "review_text": "Considering all that the game has going for it, it's hard for me to go against the grain with this one. Pros:  - Interesting gameplay ideas,  - Great level design, and art style over all (even though it's nearly always brown)  - Good character development  - Excellent graphics  - Pretty nice combat Cons  - Quick-Time Events: These kill the gameplay more than anything. There is nothing more frustrating and degrading than dying more than several times because the game thrusts button presses at you while there's action on-screen. These events even make their way into banal events like opening doors or kicking open objects, and even some cutscenes. This is what I can't stand in this game, when my skill level is brought down to my ability to press a button to progress through a cutscene that I have no other effect on anyway. This happens CONSTANTLY. All throughout the game, I ragequit simply because I can't press a button fast enough and I die instantly several times in a row. Unbelieveable.  - Mucky movement mechanics: In an effort to make movement more 'realistic', Lara instead moves as if she's guessing where I'm trying to go rather than directly responding to my keyboard. This makes getting into cover painful, simply because I'm hoping her AI can do it for me, rather than simple cover buttons that work better in so many other games.  You can play the game yourself to see whether this will bother you, but honestly, having finished the game, there were gleaming moments of solid design all-around, that ultimately fell victim to stupid Quick-Time Events that will kill you unfairly.",

            "review_text": "First, I am a guy raised with the first Tomb Raiders on the Playstation. I think I did all of them but I don't really remember everything. If there is a thing that Tomb Raider did well along the franchise it's mixing a great sense of exploration, mystery and wonder, with acrobatic action and fights. So, did they succeed to reboot the franchise without loosing the essence ?  In 2 hours I already saw a lot of flaws, they were so obvious and visible, and then after 3-4 hours I began having fun. Combats are kinda relaxing, but easy and dumb (man, the AI...). Exploring some beautiful environment is great. But I had a mixed feeling about the game all along.  Here is the thing, it could have been a lot better and the beautiful work that has been done in all department felt wasted. I just wanted to finish it, quite quickly actually. Play the ending, and then pass onto another game. I can like a game of the same style, an action adventure Hollywood-like. Let's take Dead Space 3: I had a good time playing it, it's a rich game, the gameplay is constantly switching and evolving, every sequences are great and you feel like you had enough when you finish it.  When I do Scripted 'on a rail' sequences in Tomb Raider (Lara falling, escaping, that kind of thing), it's not challenging, it feels long, no choices, easy and slow QTEs (QTEs alone are already not so good...). When I do climbing it doesn't need dexterity, accuracy or timing in your inputs. When I do stealth, I just pick up my bow, silent arrow, aim for the head, if I miss it and don't hit the body ? Well the worst thing that could happen is just distracting the target, he doesn't suspect a thing. When I do combat I don't need to be smart, pick up the right weapon or having a tactic (for at least 90% of the opponents). When I'm exploring, I just push the 'survivor sense' button, see what's glowing, go there, tap it again, for what ? Boxes that gives just a little XP or scraps. No inventory or item managing, no perk trade-off. You collect stuff, upgrade your gear throughout the progression, that's it. There is nothing really smart about any of the game mechanics.  Face's animations could have been better for a AAA title, on the technical side you can see that they were so limited by the old gen of consoles. Still it's beautiful on PC, but some stuff like the characters are not detailed enough, every cinematic (in engine) feels really poor. Lara is weirdly animated, it's too nervous and jumpy, even if there is details and contextual animation (Lara approaching her hand next to a rock while holding the torch, those kind of thing). From time to time it even feels like fps went down, but no, the animation is just jerky, and sometime it's the camera too.  The scenario is classic adventure stuff, nothing new, the character of Lara is not explored. Oh yeah, she get dark, look at how killing hundreds of bad guys is destroying her... For a surviving explorer, she have a biggest killing history that most war heroes. The other characters have nothing that set them apart from what we've already seen in other games or movies and are predictable. So I don't listen to the characters notes hidden everywhere. Frankly, it's boring to spend time reading or listening to it when all that I want is progress. For me the biggest let down of the adventure is that it would have been a powerful experience if it was more believable. Everything is PG13, exaggerated, flat. Big explosions, frenetic action, Lara yelling and getting wrecked every 5 minutes are not what moves a player. And it's short, 10 hours ! Why so many AAA action games always aim for a short adventure ? Of course we would want 4-5 hours more, they don't have any excuses for that.  So yeah, not a great experience. But I remind you, i didn't have a bad time either. Some stuff are good, 'hidden' tombs are interesting, there is not a lot of them but it's a nice little puzzle. Still too easy though.  Environments are impressive, maps are big and have a lot of vertical progression to them. I love the FOV they choose, mainly because I played it on 21/9 monitor I suppose but still, you see so much. I have quite the setup for gaming, big rig (GTX 980...), awesome monitor, headphone amp, subpac... So of course I enjoyed the ambiance, environments, music etc... The adventure, even though it's déjà vu and not deep, is well orchestrated and have a nice pace to it.  So, 'Did they succeed to reboot the franchise without loosing the essence ?' No, at least not as well as it could have been. It's not a bad game though, but 'not bad' is not what you expect for a reboot of such an iconic franchise. I talked in this review about how this reboot of Tomb Raider is failing at being a great game. There is a bit more stuff in it, this doesn't cover the whole game, but it's basely what I will remember from those 10 hours. Still, this makes me wonder if the next one is gonna be really better. After all, those kind of games are made so that you buy the sequel coming in the next few years. ",

I myself actually never really played a Tomb Raider before. It's not a bad game but not the best in my opinion.   Graphics are good - even if it's already 2015, nearly 2016. As in most games, the hair isn't really good. Only Lara somehow has moving hair, all the others have static hair :/  What really made me decide to give a negative review is the story. Again it's not the worst story ever, but I always knew that if I'm really close to escaping the island, something new happens so I would have to do something again. For me it was like a really short story but the devs thought of some dumb things to make the story longer. Example: Oh we found a boat, but we need the tools that are like 10 miles away. Okay I got the tools but now all of a sudden the enemys are attacking again. 5 minutes before I'm there they take someone with them. Too bad you now have to go away 5 miles again to rescue said person. The game isn't that hard aswell. You have like 2-3 seconds to press the right key.   The multiplayer isn't really a thing and you have to get like lvl 60 to get some cool stuff: not really easy, the game is already 2 years old. I only played multiplayer once or twice.  I like that the game saves often.  Achievements and Collectibles: I'm absolutely not a fan of them so I finished the game with 65% completion. They're just not really a big thing in the game. Hunting is like once in a kind of tutorial involved but I never ever did hunting again. The upgrading system is cool, you want to get some salvage to get your weapons better but I don't think they have a really big impact on the gameplay.  Conclusion: The game isn't bad but I would appreciate some improvements to the story and some aspects of the gameplay. The graphics are really good - except the hair.",

The story is quite good except for one thing, Lara Croft stays the little girl the entire way through. In the beggining you can understand she is scared and weak and that is ok, but she stays that way the entire game. You kill a enemy in a cutscene and Lara is horrified that she killed someone, the entire game(except for enemies not in cutscenes). And it's kinda stupid that you kill so many enemies and big scary people yet, she nevers turns into the badass that we see her in the other games. It's kinda immersion and character breaking but besides that the game is great. The puzzles are cool (except for the    Judgement tomb  ) and sometimes difficult to figure out.

Did I mention that you HAVE to do the collectable to have any understanding of what the heck is going on on the iceland?   And there is a TON of 'video clips'. Holy moly the amount of them makes this game more of a QTE interaction motion video.  And the main character you control is a wimp. Who the heck is this person? A random chick grabbed from the street then thrown into chaos? She is so weak and have an non interesting personality that it is on the border of boring. She cries, she whines, she whimper, she has no self esteem.... This is the person who is going to be Lara Craft the adventurer, and we have this drama queen? People in the reality show 'Big Brother' have more interestring personallity than the characters in the game.  The mobs in this game is boring and uninteresting. Not 1 bossfight was interesting or challanging. There where no gimmick or techniques. Dodge, F, QTE, I win. That is every fight with the few 'bosses' there is in the game. I have never ever played a game with so badly created bosses than this game. This game take the lead with a lightyear.  Then there is the movement, holy ♥♥♥♥ this is bad. Melee combat really suffers because of relly sluggy and bad movement.   And the 'puzzles' in this game is laughable. The DLC's are just stupidly expenceive compared to what it gives. Each catacomb is like 5 minuts. The puzzles are so easy that I wounder if they even tried to make it challenging or just put them in the game to have some 'content'. I think the longest I used to solve a puzzle in this game is about 2 minutes.  Do I recomand the game for full price? HELL NO!!!  If you get the game on 70% or better sale, buy it and play it. But don't expect some strong personality evolvement from the main character or any other you see in the game and don't expect any wow moments or experience from the game. It is a good looking half good action adventure game and nothing more.   Will I play the game again? Never.",

            "review_text": "totalbiscuit's description was fairly accurate, but I didn't enjoy this game. first of all the plot is so predictable and cliché that is was more annoying than enjoyable, because come on, it's the same basic maja-ish ritual magic story in which nothing makes sense, also stupid plot devices, and don't move the story forward in any way. I won't spoil it too much, but you make a disstress call, and the help you've asked gets destroyed, and in that part which took like 2 hours was completely useless and didn't progress the story in any way. Also notable was that it could have been directed by Michael Bay, almost everything explodes or gets destroyed, also some actions made by lara are not really survivable, like falling from real high, to getting wounds (because the plot says she has to have one) and are forgotten after 10 minutes of gameplay. Pretty awesome gameplay mechanics used a single time, there are also no surviving mechanics accept hunting which you do once and don't have to do the rest of the game, enemies on weird unreachable places like on high pillars, which then move and then magically disappear. the transaction between scared girl and mass murderer happens in one cutscene in which some bad guy gets killed, cries for 2 minutes about it and then starts killing everyone. It pretends that the game isn't linear, but it actually is because in most cases you don't have to get back, and is kind of weird because pretty often the path is destroyed or inacessable. And one last thing I straight up hated: a lot of quicktime events.",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider is the reboot of the classic adventure games, but with a dark and gritty feel. Will you want to play this or go back to the originals ?  Tomb Raider follows on Lara Croft as she is on an expedition to find an Island called Yamatai which was once ruled by queen Himiko. The ship crashes on the island which is populated by crazy survivors who want the entire crew dead. So it's up to you to find a way of the island.   To begin this review I want to express something about this game. When it was first announced, I wasn't a major fan of the gritty and violent tone of the game. I felt that taking it too far would take away the charm the original game had. But after I had the chance to sit down and play it, I feel mixed on the game.  Now I'm not calling the game bad, I quite enjoyed it and found myself on the edge of my seat in some moments. But this game suffers from major problems which I hope will be fixed in the upcoming title Rise of the Tomb Raider.   The story is this games weakest point. You're supposed to root for the characters to get of the island and you want them all to stay alive. But apart from Lara i didn't care for anyone. All characters felt one dimensional and it was really hard to actually like any of them. You have stereotypical characters like the nerd, the tough old guy, the mentor and stuff like that. Not to mention the entire plot is incredibly predictable and you can see who dies from a mile away.  The gameplay is fun, but it feels more like a cover shooter than a mixture of both Adventure and Shooter game which the original game was. I felt the game focused way too much on the combat and not so much on puzzles. The game does have optional tombs that have puzzles in them so you can get the treasure, but it's incredibly easy to miss these tombs.   The game is also riddled with bugs and glitches. One time the game crashed because of an explosion I caused. Enemies phase through walls and you can glitch through walls too.   Graphics and the environments look absolutely beautiful and it's one of the best looking games I have ever played. Maxed out it's one pretty looking game.  The optional tombs are probably the best thing about this game. I loved the puzzles and the whole figuring out stuff even though it was incredibly easy.   Boss fights are another problem with this game. Most boss fights consist on how many shotgun shells can you blast in the shotgun face. Apart from one cool boss which took place up on a lift that's falling apart there's not much variety.  The entire game took me 10 hours to finish everything expect find all the collectibles. The game is overall pretty easy so you shouldn't have much trouble finishing it.   In the end this game tries too hard to be Uncharted with it's over the top action sequences. The game is still a really fun game and I would say it's worth buying just to play through it once. But expect more of an third person shooter and not a Puzzle driven adventure game with shooting involved.   Final Rating: 7/10 - Worth Checking out   If you liked this review, please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments what you disliked about the review.",

First, it's a modern game with loads of bad modern habits. The first hour it tries to hold your hand very, very firmly to explain the mechanics. And yet, it doesn't make a good job with that. I died 3 times in the introduction mission without seeing any enemy. Just annoyng.  Second, loads of moments that take you out of gameplay: Cutscenes, forced slow movement scenes without any gameplay or even story relevance (beside that dubios 'showing the weak side of Lara'-idea), useless 'press Y repeately to open hatch'-kinda moments and oh yea, and quicktime events! Why can't we just run around and encounter things in a gameplay kinda fashion?  Third: Jumpscares! Yes, creatures were attacking you surprisingly in earlier games, but here they go overboard to the point of making this game a borderline horrorgame. I see the point in the characterisation of a young Lara being afraid of the world, but they could have gone a far subtler way.  All in all it's not a bad game. But i'm just sick of a lot of those modern game design elements, that try to extend gameplay time artificially to cover up for weaker gameplay mechanics.",

Consequently, I took the game equally serious. Furthermore, ten hours is too short, all characters are simplified stereotypes with maybe two traits each and Lara herself has no personality whatsoever and is constantly bound by her environment, that only leaves her one option. She merely reacts to the environment and if that's all that I wanted to see I could also watch a dog walk around the island for ten hours and get the same result as playing this miserable reboot with no right to exist.",

Game play/mechanics: 8/10 Only marred by some of the quick time events, and as much as I usually hate QTEs, at least half of them are really good in this game, the ones that aren't give it a pretty major hit though. When they suit and advance the story, they are really really good, but there are a few of them that feel pretty tacked on, and one in particular that's the major concern. (No spoilers, you'll figure it out).  Graphics/visuals: 11/10 Best looking game I've ever played, the art direction, detail, atmosphere, everything is AAA+, amazing job.  Story: 10/10 Highly subjective, I really enjoyed it. It's a great concept, and really well pulled off in my opinion. Well above typical 'gaming' story and voice acting. Better than 99% of the movies released in the last 5 years.  If I had to use one word to sum this game up, it would be 'professional'. Everything about the production of this game is first rate. If it wasn't for the annoyance of a few QTEs, this game would rate as perfect for me. An outstanding game, and one that every gamer should own. Worth whatever price they feel like charging you.",

Most of the game was in fact Hid behind a rock and shoot every enemy you see until you run out of ammo and then switch to a different weapon.  The story started off great and successfully told the story of a girl willing to do anything to survive on a remote island, and managed to not suck all the way through.

The game is worth buying, especially if it's on a discount. The DLC on the other hand, is not so much worth buying even if on a discount. The DLC offers very little content even if you are not a cheapskate like me :) .   For me, as someone who hasen't played the entire Tomb Raider franchise, the game was fun. Even with the story that was lacking, this reboot was enjoyable. A bit of platforming here and there :)) , a bit of action (even though it was a bit to easy) and a bit of puzzle solving . . . although the puzzles in this game are extremely easy to solve. That is if i can even call them puzzles, since they require a minimal action to solve.   Overall, i would give this game a 7.5 out of 10.",

I mean the clues make the whole game feel like a training mission before you start the action campaign. On the plus when you see the game for what it is (hopefully not what the Tomb Raider series will be from now on), the action is fun, graphics are beautiful, controls are good, and plays more like a Uncharted game. The story is a bit far fetched, and would prefer a more adult approach to the entire game. Seriously this is a console version of Tomb Raider, not the game we/i remember at all. 6/10.

The story is pretty good, although I wasn't as invested in it as I wished I was. The gameplay is pretty fun. It consists of taking out swarms of enemies and some puzzle-solving. The missions are pretty good. There isn't much replay value in this game unless you want to play through the story again. Also, this is the only Tomb Raider game I have played, so I don't know what the old games were like. But I believe this game is much less focused on puzzle-solving than the old ones.

At the beginning of the game, the boat in which Lara and her team/friends are travelling capsizes and Lara ends up on a mysterious, hostile island, where the survivors are hunted down by the island inhabitants. In the game, Lara will attempt to find and rescue her team and to discover the terrible secrets of the island.   As Lara goes forward in her quest to make it out alive with her friends, she will get new weapons and new skills. She can also collect materials in order to upgrade her weapons (which are pretty powerful in the end). I really liked the fighting in this game, it can be pretty intense sometimes. As it's a Tomb Raider game, the player will also need to use their brains a little to be able to reach the next area from time to time.  +/-  + well-written story + beautiful game (not amazing by today's standards, but it looks good) + good gameplay + love how the game shows the progression of Lara  + a lot of action, stunts, and fighting  - even in the hardest game mode, the game is not that challenging in my opinion  - I had a few bugs, like my character getting stucked for 30 seconds before magically getting unstucked. It didn't happen often, it didn't bother me.  - the game is short to complete. I'd say you can easily finish it in 10 hours if you don't really take your time to look around each zone.  I would like to add that the game also has a multiplayer mode that I haven't tried and I'm not interested in it. If it's good and if there are still active servers and players, it might add a lot of fun to the game.  Also, I read in some of the reviews that didn't recommend the game that it's because it's too linear compared to games such as Far Cry or Just Cause. Tomb Raider is definitely a linear game, so if you're looking for open world games you shouldn't buy it.   In the end, I would give this game 8.5/10. Tomb Raider is a must-have for any fan of the series or just a fan of action-adventure games.",

They've somehow managed to maintain the spirit of the original Tomb Raider games and it makes this game rather unique, feeling distinctly different to other similar games. Definitely not an easy game, or for the squeamish, and it can be quite exhausting, as very intense sections appear regularly and can be utterly unforgiving. Be prepared to die, and die often ,,, and usually horribly.   Very strong game and holds up well throughout. There are small puzzles but they're nothing strenuous, they can be figured out fairly easily. They've added hunting which is interesting but doesn't really serve much purpose - if they'd gone the Far Cry route where you actually use the skins of the animals you kill, it would've made more sense.   The controls can make Lara look a bit jerky but it's a minor flaw. The climbing and jumping feels like pure Tomb Raider and work very well. It's easily the most fun part of the game. Combine with a bit of treasure hunting, history and collections.  The one serious problem with the game is that most achievements don't get recorded - I finished the entire game and ended up with 8 achievements of 50. From the forums, there are many, many people complaining about this. Extremely annoying.  All in all, very solid game and a pleasure to see a beloved franchise given a modern overhaul.

There are scenes in this game where woah holy sh*t everything is BEING DESTROYED AROUND ME LOOK AT ALL THE CHAOS all I gotta do is press forward on the control! Yeah it looks awesome and I loved it at first but after the fifth time I just rolled my eyes so hard. At a point I wondered what the difference would be between what I'm doing and just watching a Let's Play of the game. Because this thing might as well play itself at this point.   Just as the aforementioned room of explosive gas and enemies most areas you enter have everything set in a way that it might as well have been ANOTHER QTE. You are in a tunnel and crawl through it, and an enemy will always walk in front of you but not see you. The logical progression here is silently take him out, then take out his friend next to him on this small walkway where you have no option but to confront him, and then take cover behind this conveniently placed piece of cover on this small walkway and take out the enemies that are clearly in your line of sight whilst covering, proceed once they're dead to this QTE event where you press forward and ocassionally press the jump button as everything blows up around you. This isn't a game it's an ''interactive experience'' where even the shooting segments where you're actually playing the game feel like a QTE. That's amazing.  There was a point in the game where it started getting REAL good. This was somewhere around the mid point, where I find one of Lara's allies and am in a relatively large area with the task of getting to a waypoint. I felt like I was actually given a challenge and had to find a way to accomplish it. ''Ah, I can go here and then proceed this way''. Granted the solution was still just one, but giving me the space to FIND the solution rather than being given it makes a world of difference: you're still being linear in design but not in results and what the gamer is actually going through mentally. Allow me to fail; give me the space and vagueness to make me THINK and CONSIDER options. The solution can be one but give me the space to think of what it might be before you tell it to me cause having me stop and think is somehow an evil. Worry not cause the game defaults on QTE once again after that incredibly short section.  It's a shame; the game had a few glimmers of what could have been. Beyond the ''walk through small crevices really really really slowly'' sections, you had a few 'optional tombs'. Lara would monologue any pertinent information, and continue to do so as you explored it further. You walk in and find a way to get the treasure chest; simple but this is about as much puzzling this game will ever get. Too bad these tombs were short as hell and literally consisted of one puzzle each. One simple puzzle.  Then there was the Rambo feel I got at times: Lara making her way through the jungle alone with enemies looking for her. In the beginning you have to kill a deer for food; Lara is pensive but does what needs to be done. I was prepared for Rambo part 5. Nope; here's Lara's friends and people who's names you don't actually remember other than Sam and Roth (you know I'm right). We can't go down the internalized grief and silent suffering of a protagonist, gotta interrupt it with her friends coming on-screen every few seconds. Not caring for the storyline, which is typically VERY important in super linear games like these, is a HUGE detriment. I just didn't care about Bob or whatever the hell that dude who showed up for three minutes was. And it's not until now that I remembered there was that other explorer dude who was PRETTY IMPORTANT for 50 minutes. They're just not very interesting or, other than Sam, that vital to the storyline. Yet a lot of time is spent on them. It's really weird.  Anyway if you like Asura's Wrath but without an interesting plot or like QTE's in general and shaky cams that make your damn hurt (I'm not the only one) then this incredible game is up your alley. Otherwise stay clear; it's the WORST of modern gaming design. Which means an automatic overwhelmingly positive on the steam store.",

After playing the Uncharted series this game just feels really poor. The animations aren't as good, the dialog is terrible, and Laura's character is so poorly designed. She was fearless and badass as a kid, but somehow became super squeemish? Her reactions to everything are always the same, 'OMG NO! Okay I'll do it.' Over and over and over and over. It's really obnoxious. Then as soon as you find a tomb she's like 'YES, PARTY TIME!' Where did her apprehension go? Oh that's right... it's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game.  Don't even get me started on the bugs. I can't finish the first tomb because the animations freak out and Laura goes into this death tumble in the part of the plane fuselage you're supposed to climb. She just rolls and rolls and eventually goes back to that ledge I was hanging from. Over and over and over. It's awful.  The thing I find the most horrible? The quicktime events. Every time there is some fight, it's basically quick time events over and over. It's really terrible.  Graphically the game is nice, but if you're going to make a big fuss about this 'Tress FX' hair ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, then at least make sure the hair responds to gravity. In the FIRST SCENE, she's upside down and her pony tail is the right direction. The rest of that hair? Defying gravity like a boss. She must have some killer hair products.  Overall the game feels like it had lots of cool ideas, but then it was chopped up by publisher requirements and rushed out before it was ready. It's typical 'AAA gaming' these days. Only a few studios are really knocking solid releases out, and sadly this isn't one of them.  Overall I'd give this a 5/10. The gameplay is too repetitive, the story is awful, the character development is laughably bad, and overall the only thing I liked was some of the jungle designs. Those also felt very formulaic and very much a tunnel based level design.",

There is not much else to the game other than that, it is mainly a duck-and-cover shooter with some puzzle elements to it. Don't get me wrong, I loved the new game, but it didn't really, to me, feel like a 'Tomb Raider' game.   The game looks absolutaly beautiful, especially when being used with a high-end graphics card. The story line is pretty alright, but can be a bit overdramatic when it comes to Lara and her 'survival instincts.' What's up with that anyway? she can somehow turn her wierd little sub-machine gun/assault rifle that she picks up from one of the islanders and then somehow turns it into an AK-47? and then from that into a 'Commando Rifle'? It doesn't make sense. And Lara must be some sort of wizard to be able to fall from the heights that she does, lands barely winded, and walks off fine. She must have all of her ribs cracked by now. I had a friend of mine only fall a metre and crack a rib!   But anyway, enough of the rant.   tl;dr: Overall, it's an amazing game, doesn't really feel like a 'Tomb Raider' though, looks good, and has some wierd magical powers of turning a homemade bow into a compound bow.  8.5/10",

With terrific graphics, great music, over the top set pieces and a story which tells us how a survivor, aka Lara Croft, is born this game is a must play for every action fan out there!

I feel as though the developers either rushed to get a finished product or just got lazy past the half-way mark. After about the Natural Gas Caves, the game got confusing, hard to follow- traversing the terrain became difficult, because enviroments were just mashed together and forced. Game mechanics such as the Grenade Launcher were put in without any need.   I feel as if the developers took their time and continued doing the game the way they started, this game would've been god-tier.   Also, the finale was just boring and weak. Not very grand.

She's pretty but she's not a bimbo, she actually has some clothes on, which is sadly rare in videogames nowadays. She's smart, but she's not the nerdy scientist cliché. She's courageous but she's not some kind of dumb female rambo. She's vulnerable without being the usual annoying damsel in distress. Overall she's a very likable character. - The environnements and overall graphics are pretty nice. - The writing is interesting, even though the storyline isn't anything special.  That being said, here's what I don't like about the game: - The gameplay is just downright terrible, Lara's control feels very clunky, there's QTE's all over the place, the combat mechanics are just horrible, the game allows you to take the stealth option only when it's not important to do so, otherwise it throws waves of dumb enemies at you.  - The camera does a lot of forcing its pre-determined angles on you. - The animations are among the worst i've seen, and for some reason, the other animations in this 'worst' category are also from Square Enix games. - A lot of Hitman Absolution assets have clearly been re-used in this game. And Absolution itself was already terrible.  Overall, it's enjoyable at times, but it would have been better off as a movie than as an actual game. And that's actually how the game feels, an interactive movie you actually have very little control over.",

I wonder if this was designed for using a controller, because that would make sense...  Anyway, for all that it is, and what it holds as promise... I gave it a shot, and didn't really get into it... I don't know why... Maybe the puzzles began feeling like Myst meets pitfall.. Dunno.  I experienced what was intended, I don't know if I would have played this without having gone to that presenation. And don't know if I'm happy that I did.  What do you think?",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider unfortunately doesn't live up to the hype or praise.  It's extremely linear, the mouse and keyboard controls frequently fail to recognize what you want to do, while standing behind cover Lara will often outright refuse to shoot to one side or the other and I've noticed numerous bugs and glitches.  Some of the bugs include being shot (while being unable to shoot through) various solid objects; from the floor to the ceiling and even various chest-high-walls - you can never know when the game engine will mess up and you'll be hit by a random bullet from a guy you can't even see.  Another big issue that I want to get off the list quickly is enemies spawning and de-spawning in plain sight. There's literally no excuse for an enemy to appear from thin air within melee distance from me in this day and age. It's unforgivable. As for enemies despawning within clear vision - well, it would've at least been nice if the game allowed me to loot them for salvage first.  Beyond that, it's a cover-based shooter with four guns, each with some additional fire modes, but those do nothing to alleviate the fact that you're using just four standard weapons for the entire game (and in numerous sequences, only one of those weapons - usually the starting one which is the bow. Bow, pistol, assault rifle (which doubles as a granade launcher) and shotgun. Nothing special or exciting.  Functional would have been the best way to describe it, but due to the aforementioned bug where Lara refuses to shoot to the particular side of certain cover objects I can't even say that.  There's 'exploration elements', which means there's a bunch of collectibles for you to find if you're intereseted. But there's no reason given for them. Old GPS caches, understandable. Old things (coins, toys, etc) - okay, Lara is supposed to be an archiologist, so that makes some kind of sense. But desacrating cairns? Shooting tribal symbols? Gathering redcap mushrooms? It doesn't make any sense, and it doesn't offer any special rewards (just more useless exp points).  The game includes stealth elements - both the bow and the pistol (once upgraded) can be used to silently kill enemies. But there's no reason to when you have regenerating health and ludicrous amounts of ammo. Also, as soon as a single enemy spots you, or a target you took out, the alarm will be raised and every single enemy will know your exact position immediately, regardless of distance or number of walls (and floors) between you.  There's parkour elements, but those are terrible due to being awfuly slow for the majority of the game and are further hindred by the fact that Lara sometimes decides to simply not obey your commands. And, to top all that off, they are laden with QTEs.  Speaking of QTEs, they're all over the game. Chase sequences, combat takedowns etc - you can't play for ten minutes without having to perform a bunch of the buggers.  As for the story... Well, it's linear, boring and stupid, and every single character you meet has a digital clock over their heads just to make it a part of Lara's supposed character arc.  The problem with that is that she doesn't have any; from the moment you start the game you're scoring headshots and setting fire or exploding enemies with impunity. Whenever Lara whimpers (which is pretty much all the time), cries or is unpset it just comes across as fake.  It doesn't help that almost every member of the crew she travels with is extremely unlikeable.  Lara is supposedly heroic, but in truth she's just declared as chew toy of the day. Every single person, animal and stationary object she sees (other than the aforementioned crew) is out for her blood and they'll stop at nothing - including suicide or self-destruction - to get a taste.  I know lots of people were impressed by the graphics, but to me they aren't anything special; neither the level design, nor the quality of the assets. I realize a good while has passed since the game's release, but that doesn't excuse textures as low as can be found in this game nor models as crude as are often used. This is at it's most obvious whenever you 'raid' a tomb (which, in this particular game, means solving a single puzzle with no combat or traps) at which you find a treasure chest at the end. When you open it, Lara will always gasp at the poorly textured and low-poly, ugly items within and marvel at oversized coins with a texture so pixelated that it's almost impossible not to join her.  Overall, it's just another soulless AAA title to add to the pile - just as I initially suspected (which is why I bought it this late). Couldn't recommend even if I wanted to. 4/10.",

I've never played or bought a Tomb Raider game before - so I have no nostalgic memories to soften the rusty nails in this game (and there are many). Tomb Raider is a mediocre game ruined by Quicktime Events (QTE). Over and over again, after finishing a level you find yourself sitting back to watch a cutscene only to be killed because you must have your hands on the keyboard ready to press a button at any given moment. I suppose this tactic of distracting the player with pointless button-mashing tries to compensate for a cliche and boring story with cringe worthy dialogue even the above average voice actors can't pull off. 'You killed my BROTHER! NOW I'LL KILL YOU!!'...Yeah.   The story begins with you trapped on an island overcome by a hack director's shakey cam - where 1 by 1 Laura's friends must find themselves in situations that require their sacrifice to save her. Wah wah wah. Poor Laura, how hard it must be to lose flat uninspired characters we have no bond with. Laura herself of course is equally shallow, simply needing to be kept from falling off ledges. The whole narrative 'adventure' of this game is monotonous and repeatitive without intrique or humor. A 24page comic book could have more depth and imagination.  Unquestionably the standout pieces of the game are the environmental and level design - both second to none - which might make the game worthy of buying on sale for some who are curious. Unfortunately the tombs (puzzles) are rather few in number as they are one of the more engaging parts of the game. You'll notice at this point the controls neeed work as they still feel very controller based. The weapon system and upgrading is also another minor bright point in an otherwise unremarkable offering.   Ultimately Tomb Raider might be worthwhile if you find it on sale and are curious but you're not missing much if you decide to pass. A grand adventure game this is not.",

The gameplay really pulled me into the game. I got shivers when Lara was dangling by one hand to prevent a 1000ft drop to her death. I exclaimed during some the more gruesome kills. I gasped as Lara cleared a a ridiculously long jump over an endless chasm.  The game had great graphics, and fortunately I was able to keep on Ultra the whole time so the setting was beautiful (except for the piles of mutilated bodies, delapidated buildings, and various wreckage strew about the island). Although actual weapon variety is very limited, I never felt restricted, and always found myself coming back to the bow anyway, so I hardly missed having a full arsenal of weapons.   The story was gripping and like a good production should, wasn't afraid to let main characters die! This just pulled you even further into the game and brought a feeling of despair like you were actually there rather than just wathcing it from afar. Obviously much of what Lara does is impossible, but that's clearly beside the point.This game is fantastic and all of the absurb stunts it forces you to complete make it quite exciting. The puzzles and challenges in the game were thought inducing, but didn't make you struggle for 30 minutes to find the solution. They had the perfect amount of creativity and difficulty, making for a fun break from the raging violence!  Overall this game was very good, I have very few complaints, if any.",

That said, this reboot of the classic series is great.   Tomb Raider is a very gritty and violent retelling of how Lara Croft became the treasure-hunting survivor we all know. Rather than being eye-candy or Nathan Drake with boobs they actually make Lara likeable and her character development was fantastic. Unfortunately I thought the rest of the characters were forgettable and by the end I couldn't even remember most of their names. The story is great and kept me interested but it wasn't anything to brag about.   The combat and platforming are both really fun and I liked the upgrading system. The puzzles on the other hand leave a lot to be desired. While there are some fun puzzles I wish they had been a bit more challenging. There are also hidden tombs you can explore to get extra supplies and plenty of other collectibles like artifacts and journals.   Despite some minor issues I enjoyed Tomb Raider and I definitely recommend it. I'm really looking forward to the sequel.",

This is combined with having almost no skills or weapons apart from a bow with a few arrows. The sense of urgency is CONSTANTLY upon you and you always feel unsafe and uneasy. As the game progresses with gaining new weapons, skills and tools - so does the surroundings but more importantly, Lara's voice acting. Even the way she interacts with others and the way she talks to the enemies changes from 'Please! Don't hurt me!' in the beginning to 'BRING IT YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S!' by the end. Brilliant implementation and coming together of voice acting, interactivity (you can keep walking around even if there's an incoming radio call from your mates), cut scenes, voice acting, storytelling, level design, camera angles that show off the level design, did I say voice acting? Pure brilliance. 11/10 would pay to watch someone else play the game.",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider is the kind of adventure story that makes me want to stay home and NEVER GO ON AN ADVENTURE EVER. That may sound negative, and it kind of is, but i don't mean that I didn't like it, I just mean that it's not a 'fun' adventure. ... That didn't sound good either...  This game is fun as a user experience, but for the characters in the story who don't get to pause mid-combat and make themselves a sandwich, it's completely miserable.  It's a dark story is what I'm saying.  I find that the gameplay is... mixed. I'm not the biggest fan of quick time events (but who is?) and there are quite a few of those. The y are by far the worst thing in this game, I don't think I've raged harder at a game than during the QTE in the wolf cave. (I HIT THE BLOODY BUTTON! HOW DID I STILL FAIL?) The combat, on the other hand, is a lot of fun. It gets repetitive in places, but for the most part I had a blast. Another high point is the puzzles, which struck that perfect balance between not too easy and not too hard. I appreciate a game that makes me feel smart. Then there's the traversal... I'm down the middle on this one. On the one hand shooting a rope arrow into a cliff side and sliding down it is exhilarating. On the other hand I feel like the environment being littered with obvious 'THIS IS A PLACE YOU CAN DO A THING' markers breaks my immersion slightly, but not as much as the auto-run.  Speaking of auto-run, Lara runs when she wants to and walks when she wants to. This isn't a problem usually, but there were a couple of times where I wished i could move more slowly, especially in the shantytown area.  Also, why is the melee attack a second tier skill you have to unlock? If I were Lara the second i got the climbing ax my first thought would be 'I can use this to hit people.' but no, you have to unlock enough other skills to get to the second tier before it even becomes an option. I feel like I'm being too critical at this point, let's move on to the story. I like it. Mostly.  The story goes that you (Lara Croft) are going on an expedition to find the lost civilization of Yamati, said to be located within the dragon's triangle. which is kinda like the Bermuda triangle, but Japanese. A storm causes your ship to crash on an island populated by a cult of other shipwreck survivors who believe that the storms are caused by the spirit of the sun queen Himiko, and that the only way to stop the storms is to sacrifice Your conveniently Asian friend Sam to the sun queen. So they capture her and most of your other friends, and it is up to you, the most bad-♥♥♥ innocent shipwreck victim in history to save them, find a way to stop the storms, and get home. I like this setup, and for the most part The execution is also well done. I only have two gripes about it. First: Lara kills a guy and is devastated. That's good, but then after that she suddenly becomes a remorseless killing machine. but everyone else has already harped on this point enough, so I'll move on. Second there are three cutscenes where Lara is in close proximity to The game's main antagonist Father Mathias, when he doesn't know she's there. SHOOT HIM! Just snipe him now and this will all be over much more quickly! Oh, you're not gonna do that? alrighty then... this would be excusable once but she has the opportunity three. different. times. if you need her not to kill him at least give a reason why she can't, like maybe she tries but her gun is out of ammo and by the time she reloads it's too late. I dunno. Something. All in all, I would compare this game to Disney's Hunchback of NotreDame, It's really good, but it has a few gargoyles you have to put up with. I give it a 7/10.",

            "review_text": "This reboot of a classic series is my first experience with the franchise, so I came in with no bias, in addition to knowing little about how the game would be like. I will now proceed to give my thoughts on the various aspects of this game, rate them, and then combine the totals to give my overall score.   The Story  Lara Croft is part of an expedition to rediscover the lost Japanese kingdom of Yamatai, the Queen of which is apparently the ancestor of Lara's best friend. Upon nearing the suspected location of the island, an immense storm shreds the sea vessel, leaving the crew stranded on the island. It is quickly found that there are denizens on the island who shared a similar fate years ago, and they are hostile to Lara and company. It's up to Lara to save her friends, survive the wilderness, and uncover an ancient mystery and curse.  The story is easily this game's weakest aspect. Cliche and predicatble the whole way through, you'll solve the big mysteries early on and know exactly how a cutscene will play out a few seconds after it starts. Heck, you probably know what's going down just from the paragraph above. Not even one unexpected curveball to be found. As for the characters, Lara herself is very likable and acts realistically to what happens around her. I began to look forward to the next cutscene just to hear her piece out a mystery I already knew the solution to, or to speak to her friends. When she felt sad, I felt a bit sad as well, even though I didn't really care about what happened. The supporting cast have one-note personalities, but I did find two of them to be likable on a similar level to Lara, despite their comparative simplicity. The game's main villain has one single line of dialogue. Yeah. The game's secondary villain has quite a few more, and his backstory is relatable, but he seems evil for the sake of being evil, for no good/realistic reason.  Overall, I rate The Story 7.5/10. Not horrible, not great, but servicable.   The Gameplay  Picture Naughty Dog's  Uncharted , but with a good selection of qualities from the Metroidvania genre. I certainly didn't expect to find  that  element in this game! As the story progresses, you'll be trickle fed a bevy of upgrades that makes movement faster and easier, and allows you to access new nooks and crannies in old places. When you aren't monkeying around the semi-openworld levels in search of upgrade materials and backstory-rich books, you'll be gunning down enemies in smartly designed battlefields that keep each encounter fresh.  Stealth is certainly an option in a handful of parts in the game, using silent melee backstabs and the handy bow, but it's not a valid method of play for the majority of the game. You're forced into standard gunfights. The gun-wielding human enemies are far from bullet sponges (a common problem in the genre), going down after a reasonable amount of body shots, and dying outright from a single bullet to an unprotected head. The first half of the game, combat can feel somewhat unfulfilling. Enemies die just a little to fast to let you flex your impressive array of available moves and weapons, and you'll be wanting for more. Thankfully, the second half of the game delivers, when enemies start wearing armor that blocks bullets (It's a great, punchy feeling to shred off their armor with bullets!) and come at you in greater numbers. Unfortunately, just as the combat gets truly in its stride and you're lovin' the fast action, the game is already over. The obligatory 'final mook rush' before the final boss is the best fight in the game, and I would have loved to see more encounters like it.  The pacing is kept fresh by balancing a mix of exploration platforming, tense gunplay, and puzzle solving. No puzzle in the game is a true brain teaser stumper, but they do offer a repreive from the overwhelming action and they employ a satisfying physics element to them.  Almost everything you do and collect will give progress towards the next weapon upgrade and skill unlock. By the end of the game, Lara's a flippin' Terminator who wields guns that pretty much melt faces. Of course, you can opt out of the upgrades if you want a good challenge.  It should be noted that this game is somewhat quick-time-event heavy. The majority of scripted cutscenes have them, and they sometimes happen during platforming as well (usually only during high-action time-limit platforming). If you find them insufferable, it can be a problem.  Overall, I rate The Gameplay 9.5/10. I wish there was more of its best, and it left me eagerly looking forward to a sequel that can potentially refine and improve upon what's here.   Length and Replayability  On my blind playthrough, I endeavored to collect as many items as I could. I ended up completing the game with a 94% total, and it took me 10-12 hours. Not the best for the genre... The levels are quite open in appearance, but when you're solely progressing the story, you'll blitz through it all quite quickly. I imagine my time could be halved if I did so. Due to the linearity of the game and lack of ways to approach various situations, the replayability is very weak here. This isn't the sort of game where you'll be eager to have another go right after finishing. Instead, you'll be coming back a few months down the line when nothing else in your library seems attractive.  Overall, I rate The Length and Replayability 5/10. The slow-paced early hours aren't a big help, either.   Graphics, Quality, Glitches  I played this game on medium settings in order to maintain a high framerate on my computer. Even on medium, I found this game drop-dead-gorgeous! Every area has a heaping helping of eye candy, and they are all visually distinct from each other. One of the most beautiful 'realistic' games I have ever played. I'm sure my eyes would just flat out melt if I played on Ultra! As for quality, the game was consistantly 60FPS, even during the most hectic scenes involving particles, explosions, and large environments. It overall ran like a dream. An excellent PC port, it offers a very satisfying amount of options for graphics and keybindings, including gamepad support. I am exceedingly satisfied by the quality here.  As for glitches, I encountered two. The first was a game crash that forced me to restart my entire computer, but only made me lose 10 seconds of progress. The second was a progress-halting glitch in a PAID DLC AREA that prevented me from completing it. A google search determined that Square knows of this glitch, and offered no advice other than restarting the entire game and doing the area in a specific method. Let me make this clear... They haven't patched out a common, progress-destroying glitch in a TEN MINUTE LONG, THREE DOLLAR DLC AREA, in a whole year! That is scummy beyond belief. I encountered this glitch shortly before my game crash, and these two things happened early on, and the experience left me exceedingly mad, and almost made me quit playing.  Overall, I rate The Graphics, Quality, and Glitches 9.5/10. The two glitches I encountered where revolting and severe, but other than that, the game ran like a dream the whole way through. I can't disregard the quality of the whole crop because of two bad apples.   Overall Rating and Verdict  Story: 7.5/10 Gameplay: 9.5/10 Length and Replayability: 5/10 Graphics, Quality, Glitches: 9.5/10 Final Rating:  8  (7.8)  I would highly recommend this game if you're looking for an entertaining and cinematic action romp. It can scatch that Metroidvania itch, but not every well. Don't play for the story. Instead, savor the great gameplay, and look forward to the somewhat recently announced sequel!",

I love the graphics, and it definitely has some pretty cool moments. My opinion is coloured just a little bit by the instability i had on my system. Brand new system that is very fast and stable on every game i've played on it so far except Tomb Raider. Crashes galore, including frezing my PC once when i went to the steam overlay.   an entertaining third person shooter, haven't completed it yet but i'm a fair amount in.

Cover based shooting I never enjoy mainly to finiky positioning mechanics. But it works rather well here with a good control scheme and fluid movement animations. If I had any problems with it, it would have to be that many characters are still forgetable even till the end. And the game dosen't seam to flow well with it's tone and style, it looks like a survival game most of the time, then quickly moving into zones that look like they got pulled from 'The Evil WIthin'.

The key moment to think of is this (spoilers ahead): Lara is nearly ♥♥♥♥♥ by a man, and after a struggle she kills him with his pistol and has a moment where she cries and looks at her hands in a sort of 'what sort of monster have I become' way. Then you return to normal gameplay, and you swiftly find that you get bonus points for headshots.",

Graphically the Game is gorgeous, beautiful Vista's, great character designs and fluid animation. I personally found the setting evocotive, with the very Island you find yourself stuck on taking an ominous charachter of its own, feeling almost overwhelmingly oppressive and creepy at times. The sinister presence almost put me in a mind of the omiprecent antagonist from 'Alan Wake', but perhaps thats an odd comparison.   Mechanically the same high praise can be applied, combat feels great, platforming and puzzles are challenging without being impossible and the progression system feels almost beleiveable given the context of Lara becoming 'The Tomb Raider' through rising to tremendous challenges.   The only thing mechanically I can complain about is all the Quick time Events (QTE), of which I feel there where a few to many. QTE's have a bad habbit of getting really old, really quickly if failed. nothing ruins the sense of urgency in an adreneline pumping action scene more than dying repeatedly to a failed QTE, I find it jarring and immersion breaking, but thats just me.   Lara's new, strong &amp; beleivable incarnation makes for an engaging relatable charachter, a far cry from the juvenile, over-sexualised 1997-2008 incarnations that have put me off previous Tomb Raider Titles. Although its true that Lara does go from 'Innocent young Lady' to 'Mass Murderer' in the space of 15 minutes, we are talking about an action adventure game here, so I found it easy to suspend my disbelief.  Will I go back and 100% complete Tomb Raider? Probably not, but thats not necessarily a bad thing. At the end of the day I've gotten 9+ quality hours of escapism and and enjoyment out of this game, and It ended on a high note!   Would I would recomend? Wholeheartedly Yes.",

This game mixes excellent quicktime events with exploration AND tomb raiding (there's 6 or 7 major tombs, all with unique puzzles and art), as well as decent stealth mechanics and crisp, responsive combat.   The environments are varied and will make you go on a screenshot extravaganza, the story isn't some corny ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, it has hints and nods to past games and it's not cringeworthy or anything.   For every theme park driven zone you get a fully explorable at your own pace zone afterwards, this game just kicks major league ♥♥♥.

Tomb Raider Chronicles was one of my favorites, Lara Croft running around in all her polygonal glory shooting two pistols at foes in exotic locations (and, of course, trying to look up pictures of the Nude Mod [that didn't actually exist].) I couldn't get enough of the series. When the movie came out with Angelina Jolie, as a young teenager, I fell in love with it, watched it far too many times and developed a celebrity crush on Ms Jolie.  And then the games slowly faded away into memory and I transitioned over more to the Devil May Cry series.  It was completely forgotten about, for all I knew.  Then, a year after the actual release of Tomb Raider (2013), I heard about it. I had no idea it was continued! I saw it on steam and my nostalgic feelings for the old series came back.  So I bought it.  And I played it. And played it.  Lara was young! Hot! Ambitious! And a hell of a character. The production value of this game is absolutely wonderful. The cut scenes that turn into gameplay are so well done they took me by surprise every time. The characters are interesting and well played out each with their own personalities and histories, and they keep it all the way through.  There are enough twists in the plot to make Twizzlers blush and to keep you hoooooked. Oh my god, so hooked.   I have heard there's a sequel in the works, but I have mixed feelings about it since this one is so good. Can they make it equally as good, or will they completely ♥♥♥♥ it up? This was so unexpectedly good, I'm not sure another one can compare.  But I'm going to hope. I'm going to hope to the end of the earth that there's another one and it'll be as good.

The platforming is, as always in the Tomb Raider series, incredibly well made. You will feel like an adventurer of sorts playing this game. The story, although cliche, is fun and absorbing. However, there are a few problems.   The movement range and contralibility of Lara is rather low. There is no walking, or crouching, or going prone, or sneaking. Yes, you can 'sneak' kill an enemy, but it is easy to get spotted. It becomes frustrating. Also, the guns aren't too customizable. Enemies aren't too random, and there are no regular civilians on the island, so free travel can be a tad bland. However, if you play through the story and don't worry too much about the rest, you'll have a pretty good time.   One more thing; graphics. The graphics are very good in this game. I have an R9 280x (AMD, I know), and can run it on High-Ultra pretty well. Make sure your computer is prepared so it can experience the game in all its entirety.

Ratings for number geeks:  Story: 7/10 Graphics: 9/10 Gameplay: 6.5/10 Overall: 7.5/10  The story is interesting, but shallow. Same with the characters. I literally don't care whether they die or not. And you can't do anything to save them anyways. The gameplay is basically following prompts, basic platforming, and FPS. Sometimes it isn't clear where you are supposed to make your next platforming move, but most times the thing you want to get to glows like the sun(using MAGICALPERCEPTIONVISION). An unfortunate side effect of this is seeing areas, and 'interactables' that you cannot access without the correct weapon upgrade. Even if is doesn't make any physical sense. This should have been planned better. But I guess it's just another form of hand-holding.  Lara Croft Is fatally wounded at the beginning of the game, and continues on will-power alone so save the world, and her friends. She literally never eats, sleeps, or defacates. The seemingly fatal hole in her abdomen hinders her movement for all of thirty seconds. The rest of the time she holds onto it like an old sports injury, but only at idle. A sense of reality, or physics, is a hinderance when playing this game. Especially when crafting.  Most of the time, the game is good at hand-holding, but challenge/side quest items are intentionally placed in the most annoying places imaginable. Or are nearly invisible unless you intentionally scan dark corners using the zoom-in button.   My complants aside, the game is pretty fun if you can stop ignoring the minor issues. Nothing is really broken(How many games can you say that about these days?). It looks great, attention to ghaphical detail was incredibly high, and the perks and weapons are fun to play with.

On one hand this is one of the best 3rd person adventure games, and the other hand; a really bad button mashing game between cut scene's.   WARNING : There is a scene early in game where you will be forsed to watch Lara being forsefully felt up, you can not skip, gives you 2 seconds to try to work out what to do, 4 or 5 times, if you get one button wrong, repeat again and again. Honestly the frustration of stupid button mashing with such a sensitive scene, ruined the whole mood of the game for me personally.  Once you get passed that you can camp up, kill animals, level up, go treasure hunting, some interesting and historic artifacts, and more. Lap it up plenty more cut scene's to go.  The main aim of the game (apart from trying to make it a shoot em up, survival game) Is to set up Lara Croft's origins as a young woman turning into the great treasure hunter. Which in one sense they do a great job if you see the game for what it is ... A play through movie with a bit of camping. Was very impressed with the detail of character's, lighting voice acting and smooth game play.  True fans of Tomb Raider may not like the new direction they were going with this game, but if your new or not really a fan of Tomb raider, It may surprise you.  PRO's = Graphic's , gameplay, music, lighting, charaters = 8.5 MID GROUND = Storyline = 5.5 (It's there but something feels like it's missing) CON's = Too much button mashing between cut scene's.

The gameplay was was a little rocky at first and to me, the sensitivity was a little off at times. It took me longer than usual to get used to it, but after a while the game ran smoothly and I could really immerse into the story. Once that happened, I was hooked. I loved the design of the landscape and the environment and even though there may have been a lack of details, it didn't do anything to hurt the overall impression. aonly negative point I have to make is the very directive gameplay. Tomb Raider used to be tricky, clever and hard to to crack. This one makes it nearly impossible to go wrong.

The game is so much more than a cheap copy and seems to combine so many effective game mechanics together in wjat can only be considered a near perfect game.  Also worth mentioning is that the graphics are, to put it simply, incredible. They really set the bar high for what games can and should look like today. Combined with the excellent animation effects, the visuals stand out as a massive positive for the game.  One negative however is that the game is riddled with quicktime events. I hope their usage will be toned down for the sequel as they get annoying fast, seeming out of place in such an fresh game.  Another is the multiplayer mode. It's not worth your time or effort playing feeling completly unnecessary and tacked on. If you are considering getting this game for the multiplayer you are wasting your time, it's the single player experience where this game truly stands above the rest.

But the graphics and the puzzle factor kept my enthusiam otherwise I might not have given it a chance. However! After the initial 'tutorial' I was surprised! I loved the whole crafting/hunting after coming from a Skyrim, the system gave into my OCD of having to find and collect everything, and I had to retry many 'cutscenes' because I failed to press the buttons in sequence and time which actually kept me on the edge of my seat instead of an old couchpotato button bash..   Lookin back on my experience, the fears I had of linear progression were somehow distracted giving me a sence of openworld and being able to choose my battles, however once a battles complete it seems thats it for the area apart from the occasional wild boar that randomly stumbles into u (not fast travelled back yet so lets hope the developers will surprised me with some bandit camps).

I would say that the multiplayer is not that great, but besides that this game is worth looking into. I'll be looking forward to the sequel that they recently announced.",

It all boils down to the sharp bone/stick that forms the largest and most ghastly plot hole. If you are in a jungle and have an open wound, infection is practically assured. And yet Lara manages to shrug off this potentially mortal wound (scant inches from her kidney and the vascular system that feeds it) wading through blood filled cave water and yes even an open latrine for an improptu cliff city of psychotics. Still no infection or even the slightest concern for the wound that should be killing her. After getting medical supplies to help a friend with a broken leg, Lara places no priority on cleaning the wound even.  Round Up Time: can't get into the games other enjoyable features because I have basic first aid training and can't get over how a game using the phrase 'a survivor is born' can get away with ignoring basic survival priorities.

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider's never particularly been a series that I enjoyed. From my youth, I can recall people fawning over Eidos/Crystal Dynamic's creation as she swam through tombs, punched sharks in the face, and I presumably interacted with pre-rendered backgrounds.   Regardless of any connection to the former games, the 2013 remake of Tomb Raider is an incredible adventure in its own right. Setting the stage for Lara Croft, it acts very much as the birth of the character. Throughout the game, you will feel yourself pushed by nature until finally, Lara starts pushing back.  The environments are lush and relatively varied, especially considering that the entirety of the game is one geographic location. What becomes a game of hunting a few deer and defending yourself from feral wolves seems to effortlessly turn towards the Indiana Jones-style of blurred lines between myth and history.  The game has a high degree of reliance on two systems: its combat and climbing/navigation systems. I'll begin with the combat.   Like many adventure/action games these days, TR opts for a minimal HUD presentation, and players have access to (eventually) four weapons. Each of these weapons has its own alternate fire modes. Throughout the game, you are either granted or given additional tools or weapon upgrades; 'parts' for weapons are obtained in the numberous boxes hidden all over the island, so there's always something to upgrade. Combat feels relatively tight but not TOO tight: upon playing the game I was a bit confused by the lack of the standard lock-on function at least at the mid to close range to aid with dodging and counters. However, upon reflection, this is appropriate: Lara may have training, but she's no Kratos. The game feels much more interested in asking the players to use Lara's wits to survive rather than her brawn for many situations, and although I favored the bow in my playthrough, I found myself changing my ammo types and pulling out my other weapons with great regularity to match the challenge ahead of me.   There are some issues in combat, however. While the majority of the game is easily on the 'average gamer' difficulty, occasional situations can feel overwhelming, as enemy spawns appear linked to your movement. If you opt to mow down enemies while advancing forward, you can quickly find a pack of armored soldiers behind you. At least one encounter I died to, only to realize what was going on and upon slowing down it became much easier. This did somewhat bother me, as I felt like the game was dictating my pace, but it's not unforgivable. Additionally, at random times the heavy machine gunners will lock on you like they're 360noscopemlg420 and you'll find yourself eating dirt in less than 2 seconds from full health.  In addition, the Pistol feels like it's superfluous. Perhaps it's because mine lacked upgrades, but I pretty well threw it out the window. That being said, the moments where Lara finally realizes that she IS a badass and vocally lets it known are very appropriate in their timing in the combat and story.   The second system that it hinges on is its climbing and navigation. You have a small number of tools with a few uses. Long short short, you can climb rocks, grapple ropes on certain surfaces, etc. Lara's climbing got a solid 'A' from me solely because it avoids slowing down the pace of the game unlike the grunt-laden climbing in games like Assassin's Creed where it becomes a chore. Occasionally the game actually will integrate the navigation and combat elements and it's a delight.  While I feel like the story has a couple gaps; namely that it takes Lara far longer to understand the plot than it takes the player, they really don't detract from the overall enjoyment of the game itself. The game is also relatively short; you should be able to finish the entire game in a full day, 6-9 hours depending on how many of the ample side quests and collectibles you want to grab.   The biggest 'miss' I saw while playing is that the game really doesn't balance the hunting aspect very well. This is really stressed early on as you have to make a fire, find food, and so forth. However, and maybe this is to the benefit of the game, it's structured in such a way that you can ignore it once necessary.  All in all, Tomb Raider is a very solid entry into a saturated action-adventure field. It very successfully evokes feelings of desperation, sorrow, and downright sympathy from the player for the protagonist. You know the whole time that Lara will come out on top (especially if you're aware of the upcoming sequel), so there is no doubt that Ms. Croft will 'live', but the game piles so much misery and brutality from an unhospitable location that you begin to wonder if she can ever 'live well.'  8/10",

Lara's development is handled with gravitas, though as always it's difficult to reconcile a story depicting the emotional development of a neophyte while not leaving the gameplay angst-filled, incompetent, and non-fun for the first stages of the game. In this task, they decided to opt for a disconnect between her emotional state during cutscenes and her gameplay, which can be jarring. But she is a capable protagonist, and while she receives help from time to time she rarely needs saving. The other characters are there to support her.  If you possibly can, ignore the hullabaloo surrounding the pre-release scandal and all the comments made by various producers regarding the game in general and certain controversial scenes. Most fears I had going into the game - that Lara would be infantalized, gratuitously sexualized, or demoted to a supporting role in her own game - were unfounded. On its own - the game is everything one should want in this regard.  Gameplay itself isn't perfect. Some quick-time events are annoying to deal with. One at the end of the game is completely mis-calibrated - I had to switch to a gamepad during that sequence to even have a hope of finishing it properly. Lots of the game's content amounts to near-meaningless achievement-hunting. Ammo is tight in a few early segments, but eventually becomes a complete non-issue.  There's lots of Tomb Raider platforming, but very little in terms of Tomb Raider puzzles. The only real puzzles are contained in the optional tombs that you can raid along the way, and each tomb only has one environmental puzzle - solve it and you get a perk or two and a zipline back to the start of the tomb. There was so much more potential there, wasted.  Since Tomb Raider came out the same year as Bioshock Infinite, and the two are both adventure shooters, it's natural to compare the two. Bioshock is better. It's not much better - Tomb Raider is very well done, but Bioshock has a bit more depth and a bit more of an immersive factor.  7/10",

            "review_text": "after 7 hours i found out i didn't like this game and that its a good game here is a looong list why 1) things i liked which you might not: - the game made me feel bad for a fictional character. maybe im a perv but the first time Lara had to ,slowly and painfully remove a metal rod from her pancreas i thought it was kind of hot, 7 hours later however i just want to give her a blanket and send her to a psychologist. this character gets traumatized, shot, hit, stabbed, beaten, etc (not including the various death cut-scenes) so many times it feels like the writers really hated her for some reason, i like that in works of fiction - the 'tomb raiding' was mostly optional and separate from the main story, so if climbing puzzles aren't your thing, well you don't have to go looking for treasures as much  2) things i didn't like which you might like: - 'cinematic experience'. the game is cut-scenesand QTE heavy. they are done well for the most part, but this is basically why tomb raider is not my type of game.  - the cinematic experience means the game is very linear. most of the levels don't just start at A and end in B letting you do what you want, they are roads you are put in. even tho there are some optional quests and hunting and crafting, almost everything is done in what are basically corridors ( kind of like fable1). it is cinematic but a bit boring for me and i stopped playing after 7 hours.  - too much shooting/bullet spongy and numerous enemies. most gamers probably like this but personally if i have to shoot something multiple times in the head or have to kill hundreds of people as an individual i feel cheated - too many (nitpicky) problems with the story. i wont say anything spoilery but one that isn't and really grinds my gears is the simple logistics of running an island of murderers cut off from the world loosing HUNDREDS of them in firefights with a terrified girl with ptsd and then still having the man power for more, how do they feed themselves how do they get enough ammo where do they get cloth from just wtf!. that said for most people will be too immersed to care or notice - upgrade and customization is not done well and the game would have been better without it  3) things probably everyone will like: - they really did a good job with the player model. sure she is made attractive for obvious reasons but it goes deeper then that. over the course of the game youll see the effects of wear and tear on Lara's equipment and her body. at the start of the game she looks like a normal happy person would, give it a couple of hours of story and she will be bloodied, dirty, brutally scarred and have a very determined but sad look on her face as she runs (or limps) around. in other words they did her physical transformation to an action heroine very well - i think the animations are (while not ground breaking) done very will - the voice acting is ( for the most part) great - the graphical fidelity and effects are AAA, not the best but still very good (2013) - the ai while not very innovative, was (for the most part) competant",

Tomb raider was a big surprise, best reboot I've seen in long while. One of the best looking game on pc, but if you want to max it out it requires a bit powerfull pc. The story, the gameplay, everything was incredible. It's like and uncharted game, but with less action and more stealth. The only bad thing I could think of is that the game needs secondary character developpement and the game would have been perfect. The multiplayer is pointless, the only reason I could think of tho play it would be for the achievement. 9.5/10 the best game i've played this with alonside Bioshock Infinite",

There was also gigantic disconnect between cut scene actions and what the gameplay presented, that is never good way to present a GAME. Jumping bits were very much automated without any requirement of timing on the jump and the 'nearly made it' scripted QTE events reeked modernity, in the bad way.  Basically same issues as with nearly all new reboots and games. Gameplay sacrificed on the altar that worships cinema. Simplification with nothing added. Gameplay elements that are unecessary but create 'replayability' while the game actually provides none.  Meh game from start to end. I only hope the future installments take their gameplay cues from earliel games of the serie rather than what it was now.",

One thing that kind of of confused me was at the end when it gets mythilogical on you but besides that the story was OKAY. the gameplay though makes up for that 110%because there is alot of collectibes and fun tombs and areas. It was definitely a faithful prequel to the tomb raider series which I loved as a little kid {I really don't know why Iliked it as a kid I guess I was really into girl protaginists but but they were good so I don't care). you shouldn't get to excited to for the multiplayer though because some matchs you are matched with n00bs and the rest you are paired with the most try hard players ever ,it's kind of sad because I remember the trailers and many of them focused on the multiplayer but the multiplayer wasn't good.That is my review for Tomb Raider . .

The story seemed very interesting and well developed, just maybe not too in depth, but that is just my preference, I feel like the ending could have been wrapped up better, seems a bit rushed. It does appear slightly linear, and on games like this it is a feature that actually works pretty well, I could still feel like i have a lot of space to play around while not loosing myself to the vasness of the terrain, in times where a lot of games make you decide what to do, I find it refreshing that this game reflects on Lara's choices alone. The development of the character throughout the game is done with such a nice realistic feeling and getting to do more things as the game progresses helps it from becoming repetitive. Maybe my only flaw in this game would be the puzzles which were too easy and too predictable for me, it seemed too casual even on the hardest difficulty and I feel it is an element that could definetly spice up, not only the feel of the game but also the way you feel acomplished after completing such a difficult task. The combat system was well thought out and it was a lot of fun to figure out different weapons and use them to the fullest, the enemies gave me quite a bit of trouble, especially at the end but that is just the way I like it. I felt it was challenging enough, just maybe too predictable.

I was emotionally invested in her getting out of the island alive. The visuals were absolutely gorgeous. Played it at ultra and I swear I thought the visuals were better than the farcry series. Before the farcry fanboys begin to bash me let me say I have played farcry 4 before playing this one and I still think the environment in this game is surreal.Square Enix has done a ♥♥♥♥ing good job on the reboot and to a newcomer like me to the tomb raider franchise the story,the gameplay all were easy to grasp and enjoy. To sum it off I recommend to buy this 10/10 and would surely buy any future releases to the franchise",

Excellent voice acting, music and sound.Very good story and characters (despite the supernatural core). Clever level design and easy to understand puzzles that actual make sense. Character development and weapon customization.

Fantastic sense of presentation all around. 4. (On ultra settings) Is the most gorgeous game I have ever played. Seriously. It is ridiculous.  - Gameplay-wise think Uncharted except instead of a combat/platforming ratio of 70/30 this game is more 40/60 and never gets ridiculous (amounts of enemies) like Uncharted. - Runs about 9-11 hours.

Fighting your way out using CQC is also possible although when there are more than two enemies around you would be better off using a ranged weapon. The story wasn't something special, but Lara's character is really well written. The main theme of the game is surviving and it backs it up with a lot of sections where Lara's life is hanging by a thread and relying on your reflexes. When not in battle or climbing the game encourages scavenging for parts, hunting for XP and then building better weapons and improving your skills. It's a really good game.",

Controls: Although the controls felt a little weird sometimes, I was generally able to get done what I wanted to get done. The game is a great mix between AC (of which I am a giant fan), Uncharted (from which I rushed through the 3rd part) all combined with an amazing main charcter.  To lara: she is such an amazing character, she is smart, courageous and not afraid to do what has to be done. (what i did find ironic was that she complained about having to kill people after massacreing loads of them, but that barely bothered me)  Most importantly: This game is a finished game. It is done.

Though she learns a bit too fast to be realistic, with a few too many QTEs thrown in and too few tomb puzzles, it's quite enjoyable. The graphics are nicely done and allow you to experience the world in a fairly realistic fashion.  Not having to watch her get impaled over and over again in the waterfall because I kept getting the timing of movement wrong would have been nice though. At least the body being impaled was anatomically realistic. That's a step forward.  Despite its drawback, I enjoyed the game quite a bit and would recommend it.",

Tomb Raider will literally keep your hands on the keyboard and mouse. After the first couple MINUTES of playing the game, I would expect something sudden to happen in a QTE (Quick Time Event) or something to pop out and try to kill me. THAT is how intense and suspenseful this game can be. However, the QTEs can be hard to see through all that's happening in game, so take a second or two to see what button you have to press. And the deaths that can happen to you are terrible. I saw some of them in a review, and I happened to do a lot of deaths that were brutal and painful to watch. I got crushed by rocks, impaled in the neck by a wooden spike, impaled in the belly from a tree branch, fell into water only to hit a spike and float off in a bloody mess, and get filled with bullets and/or arrows. The combat is enjoyable, and the stealth feels great when done right.   I personally did not enjoy the multiplayer that much. I didn't find very many things to enjoy about it. All that happened was spawn camping and trying to push out only to be killed by someone who is a higher level. If not getting shot with bullets or arrows, it's being blown up by a constant spam of grenades.  Singleplayer: 9/10 It's a great story with fun puzzles, combat, and exploration. But lacks the replay value to continue. Multiplayer: 4/10 It's alright, I personally didn't like it that much. But it keeps the fun combat I guess.",

Great graphics (although for me that's not necessarily the most important thing) solid, intuitive game play mechanics, and most important (for me at least) it has a great story. I really feel like the developers did a great job of staying true to the essence of what Tomb Raider is, there are no shortage of puzzles to solve or tombs to explore in this game. There are also plenty of artifacts/relics to find, and Laura always has something to say about each one, which I thought was a nice touch. This is yet another survival game that has you using a bow (which is arguably Laura's most important weapon) and hunting for food-- although the hunting aspect isn't a huge part of the game. In a sense though, Tomb Raider has always been somewhat of a survival game, even before it was the trendy/cool thing to do to give the players a bow and arrows and add a hunting mechanic to every game the old Tomb Raider games still made you conserve your ammo and gear such as flares for example, and you still had to fend off/watch out for dangerous animals. For the next game I'd like to see the iconic dual pistols make a comeback, there was a moment at the end of this game that made it seem like that will be the case, but it could go either way. I also hope that the 'exclusive to X-Box' release is only temporary with a timed release for PC and PS4-- that is the way 'exclusive releases' usually go these days, so let's all hope that is the case here.",

By the end you feel great your bow will absolutly destroy life in the end but you need to get there. I fell in love with the game and it gave me the same feeling that i got from some platformer games like mega man x where you feel helpless i nthe begining but as you upgrade and find items you get stronger.  negatives :  Graphics where clearly meant for a console and the pc version was some sort of port from that.   Apon success i would have really liked to have been given additional quests beyond finding pickups .... maybe cleansing the island of the bandits or rescuing the loacals or somthing.  jus ",

            "review_text": "Tomb Raider is an excellent game and a successful reboot to the franchise. The combat is smooth, exploring is fun and as soon as you see the credits, you will instantlywant to press 'New Save'. Crystal Dynamics have put a lot of effort into this game and that is shown when you play it.  The controls and movement on this game is excellent. You will feel agile and strong when you play. The singleplayer story is captivating and also sad. The multiplayer, however, does not have many players, so it's hard to join a group.  The OSX port for Tomb Raider is basically identical to the Windows version, with the controls feeling fluid. The options are also identical, so if you have a really powerful Mac (don't know why you have one if you play on Steam), you can tweak everything to the max.  Tomb Raider is a masterpiece of a game. The experience is very captivating. Deserves a 10/10.",

Being an adult now, and finding this game at discount price at the Steam store, I decided to buy this game.  And I am so glad that I did.  This was my first high graphics game with my new computer, and it made me so excited to have my new toy with the spectacular looking enviornments and characters.  I could not help myself but think of the Uncharted franchise, which I also think is above par, but I would argue that Tomb Raider is better primarily for one reason: maneuverability. The movement feels less scripted, while remaining cinematic. Being able to jump like Lara, high and in whatever direction neccessary versus Nate's short, forward jump, makes a big difference for me.  Overall I would recommend this game to anyone and give it a 9/10 overall. One of my favorites ever.",

            "review_text": "I know this is an old game, but in case you're buying it to gear up for Rise of the Tomb Raider, here's a helpful review. Yes, this is the obligatory, gritty reboot of a classic franchise. But it's actually a good adventure game. Lara's on her first expedition and her lack of experience forms the emotional focal point of the story. She's forced to do a lot to survive, and mowing down waves of armed assailants to keep her friends from dying turns out to be a real drag. The storytelling and voice acting are on point, along with a soundtrack that lives up to the Square Enix name. The environments are what we might call “lush” (a word that never gets used outside of reviews), with plenty of action-packed set pieces to keep players interested. Several obstacles turn out to be cinematic sequences that involve things like escaping the path of a crashing airplane and scaling a treacherous mountainside. They’re a lot of fun, even if they do feel terribly “Triple-A”. A lot of detail went into creating Lara’s character. The ways she interacts with her environment and changes over the course of the game add to the immersion. Combat is important here, and it’s pretty solid. Lara controls well and enemies feel more human than the average NPC. My complaints are few, but significant. Firstly, Tomb Raider has always been about visiting exotic locales. While this installment definitely tries to incorporate the fantasy elements the series is known for, Lara’s expedition only covers one island in the Sea of Japan. There isn’t much to see in the way of landmarks (e.g. the pyramids, Area 51, Atlantis, etc.). Everything feels authentically Japanese, but not very awe-inspiring. As far as actual tombs go (Tomb Raider should be about tombs, right?) there aren’t very many. Most are little caves tucked into the environment that require players to solve a single puzzle. What does Lara get when she excavates a tomb? A pile of scrap materials she can use to upgrade her guns. It’s underwhelming. Exploration and platforming have been replaced by shooting and action sequences. It’s still a great game, but fans of Lara Croft might wonder how they stumbled into the Uncharted franchise while expecting something different. 8/10.",

            "review_text": "I absolutely love this game.  There. If you're looking for anything but gushing praise, you know to look elsewhere. Anyway - onward to glory.  Also, let me get this out of the way: the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay is solid, the crafting is fun, the environments are almost unilaterally epic, the story is fantastic, the supernatural element is downright rad, and the story is GREAT. Also, DAT HAIR. Now - onto why I really like the game.  I never liked the old Tomb Raider games. All my friends used to play them when we were kids, though honestly I think that was for the same reason anybody played Tomb Raider: the bewwwwbs. Hooray for fapping to early 3D pixels. And before we go on, a little about me: I like women. A lot. I like them better than men because, I'll be honest, I'm not much of a guy. I'm not macho. I only ever played soccer and ran track, and that was only for a little bit in my early scholastic career. I'm a skinny little romantic who writes fantasy novels and spends a lot of time daydreaming about being...well, basically anywhere else. Hmm. Think I got sidetracked.  Women. I love women. Specifically, strong women. I'm no social justice warrior, crusading around the internet to right the wrongs perpetrated against the feminine species; rather, I like my women to be smart, I like them to be strong, and I like them to be take-charge individuals. Bonus points if they're physically strong.  The new Lara Croft now shares the pedestal of My All-Time Favorite Video Game Protagonist with the late, great Commander Shepard. Why? Because she's the only female protagonist I've ever played who I've felt was more than bewbs and an a*s with dialogue. I'm sure I've played another one somewhere along the way, but for the life of me I can't think of any right now. So: what did they do to Lara?  First, they made her a newbie. You get to experience Lara's growth into the eponymous Tomb Raider right alongside her, and that's awesome. She goes from being a naive archaeologist, to a traumatized survivor, to a hardened hero.   Second, they gave her breast reduction surgery. I know, I know. WHAT?! That's horrible! They ruined the character and blerbedy blerbedy bler. This might seem strange, but I personally prefer women to look...well...real. Lara is still inhumanly beautiful, that is for damned sure. But the focus this time around is not on her sex appeal - that's a secondary character aspect. The focus now is on Lara the person, not Lara the body. I love it.  Third, the took away her sl*tty wardrobe. She still wears the tanktop, and toward the end of the game her pants start to show hints of the shorts she wore in most of her past games, but that's it. And honestly, the tanktop is completely reasonable. I know tons of girls who wear tanktops. It's a thing. Lots of them show their bewbs. Lara spends this game shipwrecked, with the tanktop being the last thing she was wearing before being stranded. It makes sense. It isn't there because HAI GUISE BEWBZ. And, let's be honest, if they'd done away with the tanktop in the first game in the reboot series, guys everywhere would have flipped their sh*t, because most of us think with our d*cks.   Fourth, they gave her an INCREDIBLE voice actress. I've never seen Camilla Luddington in anything else before, which is a tragedy. All of the VA work in this game is top-notch, but Luddington's especially stands out. Talk about breathing life into a character. I hope she gets more work outside of the TR games, because she deserves it.  And fifth, they made her capable. Lara spends the entire game just surviving in the face of ever-increasing odds. She starts off with almost nothing in the way of useful gear, and ends the game with a mishmash of homemade, MacGyvered tools and weapons that wouldn't be out of place four or five years into a zombie apocalypse. Not to mention - the girl takes a beating in this game. Honestly, I sometimes felt like I was watching a UFC fight where one person just continually got the sh*t kicked out of her but kept getting back up. Some (a lot) of the stuff that happens to her strains credibility (I don't think I'd be able to even function, much less climb cliffs and bare-knuckle fight bad guys after falling fifteen feet straight onto a rusty, old piece of rebar) but I think the message here is greater than the delivery: this Lara might not be a superheroine, but she's a tough scrapper whose determination against all odds is her defining character trait.  I don't think enough games have strong female leads, or honestly even secondary characters. They just don't. Bayonetta doesn't count, and neither does Quiet. And why not? In the now-immortal words of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, it's 2015. Why is this still not a thing? I don't want to play games, read books, or watch movies where men are the only real characters. It isn't realistic, it leaves me wanting more, and if I wanted to read about how awesome dudes are all the time I'd get a subscription to Maxim or Just For Men. Lara has scratched that itch for me like no other female character ever. She's on-par with the likes of Naomi Nagata and Sonmi-451, and I am immeasurably sad that Xbone fgts are playing Rise of the Tomb Raider while I'm not. I absolutely cannot wait for the sequel to this game. Infinity/10",

The idea to rework the concept and character of Lara Croft has been overdue for a long time. The guys at Crystal Dynamics did a very good job in reinventing the female character of Lara Croft as a fragile but tough and definitely not lady-like young woman. It is nice to notice a development of her character throughout the game, from a fragile and frightened little girl into a strong and confident woman. I also like the new weaponing and skilling system, it makes the game more realistic. The story itself is good and made from the stuff that action-adventures a la Tomb Raider are made of. The fights are the best part of the game in my eyes because they come close to reality, especially the in-fights. The level design is a bit too colorless and monotonous, I get the idea of a dark and morbid world and the situation the characters are stuck in. But especially the Japanese/Buddhist ruins are colorful and shiny in reality and therefore should have been depicted as such. The only colors you get are those from blood and explosions and this is simply not enough. What I absolutely don't like is the concept of mindless button mashing and randomly pressing buttons in slow motion sequences. Simply because it is outdated since the 1980s and has never been fun and adequate. If you want to emphasize the struggling of the protagonist you could have come up with combo moves or in case of the PC version include the mouse for once. What I also miss from the old games is that you play at different places all over the world. The story they came up with may only work for a single location but I hope that the guys at Crystal Dynamics come up with a multi-location setting in future games.  I finished the game in 11.5 hours with a total completion rate of 70% at a normal difficulty. In my eyes that's a little too short. You are more driven by the story and your missions, rather than Lara's actual natural behavior: relic and treasure hunting. Don't get me wrong there is absolutely nothing to complain about following the storyline, but here the act of 'tomb raiding' only looks like a nice mini-game for in between when you accidently stumble across a tomb entrance. And that's the kind of sad part, because once you have finished the game you got no intention to complete the remaining xx % or even the motiavation to play it again soon. It was fun while it lasted, but now this chapter is over. Tomb Raider is a fine piece of game: thoughtfully concepted (but not as thoughtfully created) with a love for details and fun. But nothing more.",

The graphics, even on the lowest settings are enough for me to enjoy the game. Of course, when there are huge areas of the map or an over-whelming amount of enemies, the fps will drop below 15 and it is quite annoying but If you have a beast computer, you have to check this game out.

After beginning several other games I haven´t played yet I was fascinated by detail, story and the amount of adventure in it and decided to concentrate on this game. As a passionated Assassins Creed player I found many similarities to the game in terms of character movement, which I accepted with pleasure. The thing that I found the most indicating for a good game ist the difficulty of the game itself. That means you are not being killed by a couple of shot nor are able to run into bullets with almost no damage. You have to take a look at your surroundings plan alternate escape routes and find cover and ammunition, which is scatteres across the area quite generously (but that is ok since there are no ammo shops). I never had the feeling to be bored of walking around or shooting my way through tons of enemies. The upgrade system of your weapon arsenal is huge and matches everyones wishes (e.g. silencer, flammable bullets).

Unlike Star Trek, they didn't do some convoluted time warp to change history and cause Lara Croft's life to play out differently than before. They simply gave the character and series 'universe' a complete restart.  If you haven't played any of the previous Tomb Raider titles, this is a good one to get into the franchise with. You'll be on par with Lara: experiencing it for the first time.  I described the game to my daughter as a 3D platformer. Not a platformer like Mario Brothers but rather 360 movement with obstacles requring jumping, climbing and even zip lining. Its not a true open world or sandbox game. But the story will stay on hold if you want to run around and complete any of the side challenges or look for the 'hidden' objects. You can even go back to previous zones using a fast travel system at each base camp.  Puzzles required to progress through an area can be challenging. But once you know what you need to do, its just a matter of getting the timing down.  There are some bosses which enter the area to fight with a short cutscene that can't be taken down with just any old weapon. These require you to pay attention to what hurts them and get them knocked down into a weakend state (denoted by a red exclaimation mark that appears), then run in to do a series of finishing moves which require you to press the displayed key at the exact moment.  Those are really my only gripes about the game. Difficult puzzles and difficult bosses. But if that is all I have to complain about, it just means that I need more practice.  If you haven't played it, get it and give it try. Especially if you can get it on sale.",

Every steam sale, it's cheaper than a fast food meal so there's really no excuse.  Also if you're reading this when Rise off the Tomb Raider is out on PC and aren't sure if you need to play this one first.

The ability to control the game setup in other languages good also. But, how about full Chinese audio or other languages? How about subscripts in English so that I can learn another language. How about a higher verbosity setting. Indepentalntly controlable Full audio, independently controllable subsctripts. I live in a bilingual environment. This is not usable enough. I noticed that the new TR has the languages I want, but I do not know if this new game has independent controls for audio and text. I question how playable this new game will be as I am not an action game type. So I thought I would revisit this to see if I could give this a better rating. So I started the game from scratch and now it doesn't even let me get past the Scavenger's Den. I get nailed by the guy with the pick axe. I have tried 2 dozen times.

Once I'd realised that the default refresh rate was for some reason set to 24hz it ran very nicely at 60fps and on highest graphics settings so looked tremendous. I had purchased some of the DLC only to realise that the extra guns are for multiplayer. I feel a bit cheesed off that this wasn't very obvious but oh well.. The weapons in the game are pretty great. They don't level up very equally... I ended up getting the exploding grenade arrows very near the end, at which point they were pretty redundant. Stealth fighting isn't supported all that well, the game forces you to fight from cover against numbers so the bow soon becomes more of a useful tool than a weapon of much worth, considering the time spent upgrading it! They could possibly learn a thing or two about different combat styles by playing 'Thief' and 'Dishonoured'.  The 'mash button like an idiot' or 'dodge things you can't see' sequences are thankfully few and far between, there are a few times where you just feel they might have swapped them for some puzzles as in the original games rather than having to time reactions to things without adequate warning. Those are my only issues with it... I wish the game was significantly longer, and that's how you know a game is good. After 33 hours in game to be begging for more (such as perhaps an extended mission getting all your loot back to Croft manor fighting against modern pirates and other treasure hunters on the island a month later perhaps) shows that this is truly a Tomb Raider game worth getting.

And as a young girl at the time I didn't like the idea of what should have been a strong female character being dressed in skimpy clothing (I still don't). However this game has changed my opinion on Lara. They've revamped her wardrobe. Made her dress more appropriate (for the most part -who doesn't wear a jacket on a boat?) This is who Lara Croft should always have been. And now in my mind always will be.  This is the first ever Tomb Raider game I've played. And I have to say I'm absolutely impressed. The graphics are great and the story holds up.   Game play isn't clunky at all and the controls make sense. Although I wish I could have been able to remap some of the controls for my controller however I got used to it.  What really impressed me was with regards to the subtitles. I know, who cares about the subtitles? I play most of my video games in the middle of the night, and I can't play my games too loud or else I will disturb the people I live with. So I rely on subtitles to fill in the blanks of the things I can't otherwise hear. Most games focus only on what is said, this game gave full on subtitles that included ambient noise as well.   Lara Croft, the female Indiana Jones.  Buy it now.",

            "review_text": "It was good game for what it is but it in the end it was underwhelming... although I would recommend people try it for themselves. It doesn't retain much about the franchise apart from Lara who I liked. It could be called anything else. It’s not a TR game.  Ludonarrative dissonance is a fancy term that's often thrown around but I found it particularly apt for describing the reboot. I couldn't help the longer I played it the more absurd I found it and I think it's because it wanted to come across as realistic that it's more farfetched 'gamey' elements stood out in a negative way where perhaps I would have glossed over them otherwise. Here are some of my gripes that stopped me loving the game, although again I'd say I did enjoy it overall:  - Lara is supposed to be fresh faced and her first kill is supposed to have impact which it does, for 10 seconds. She is obviously so harrowed by the experience that she can murder about 10 other people 2 minutes later without batting an eyelid and the game is about her downward spiral from innocence to full on psychopath. - There isn't any progress in Lara's skill, in real terms that is. Her weapon accuracy doesn't improve. She becomes better at melee kills at least but the game doesn't start you off completely ineffective, she's pretty much competent from the word go. I'd have preferred her struggle more and with each encounter slowly build her skill but this doesn't happen really. - Mastercraftswoman. The modifications to your weapons become increasingly farfetched for a supposedly grounded game. It's supposed to be an isolated island but the fact you can construct all these modifications from found / scrap metal is a little OTT. - Gun play and traversal is a little janky but at least the animations are well done and the game does look visually great. - Uncharted set pieces but with no pacing. This started off as a few great spectacles but eventually they just feel like they are being chucked at you for the sake of it. They don't have any build up and I did wonder on a few occasions why on earth everything Lara was near was just collapsing at this exact moment. It just felt more ridiculous than awesome. - It didn't have the courage to go toe to toe with the Uncharted series and I couldn't help be disappointed by that. Have some guts! It takes a lot of influence but doesn't want to be compared directly to it so I feel like a lot of the radical changes were put in place purely to prevent this comparison rather than for a real purpose. I feel like it created some strange hybrid. This is not an action adventure game like you'd assume TR to be. It's 1/3 Survival, 1/3 soft horror, and 1/3 shooter. Some sections felt more resident evil than TR. - the characters are boring; I couldn't care if they died or not. It wants you to care, have some emotional grounding but they could literally not even be there and it wouldn't affect my enjoyment of the game. - The ultra-violent deaths for Lara are notorious already and they were just off-putting personally. Not necessarily because they were violent but because they were just unnecessary. The lead developer must have a fetish for this stuff because I didn't feel like they added anything to the story. Remove them and it wouldn't have made the game worse. The npcs don't die in horrific ways but Lara does and the only real blood and guts are in the scenery rather than the game. It didn't go all out with the brutality to make it believable and knowing the franchise so well it felt strangely jarring and after a while I couldn't take it seriously at all like it trying too hard.  Uncharted is bowing out. I'd have loved TR to take the mantle back but it's not the direction this franchise seems to be taking. I'm not sure if I'm going to love RISE of the TR, I hope I do, but it's strikes me that it wants to be more of a shooter now than the rebooted TR / adventure game that I would have preferred.",

Good graphics, great controls and gameplay, compelling story, it's pretty much got everything. The game can be dull and boring sometimes, but the action sequences and satisfying combat make up for it pretty well.  The only thing I dislike about this game is Multiplayer; no one plays it anymore, and being an achievement hunter, there's 15 achievements I can't get without boosting, which sucks. But that's to be expected if a game is a few years old (unless it's Call of Duty). So if you buy this game wanting to play Multiplayer, you'll be disappointed.  8.5/10",

            "review_text": "This is by far the best of all the Tomb Raider games I have ever played. And even though its not perfect (but very close to), its fantastic. Its one of those games where you just keep playing no matter how many hours you have already played. You just have to try one more thing...  It has it all: A good story, Superb graphics, good sound effects and music and Laura look better and more sexy than ever (this is important). There is a lot of puzzel solving, FPS gameplay and a lot of jumping and crawling as we know Laura. This time much of the jumping is in the heights and so scary that it makes you jump in your chair many times.  What can be improved: Even though you can move Laura freely around in the world, its still a linear game. On each map Laura can move freely, but each map still has an entry and an exit you have to follow. This is not necessarily a bad thing bacause that also ensures that you have done everything needed to move on to the next map. No going back is needed (only if you want to do your 100% achivements, and for that they have made camps you freely can teleport between). Also some of the action (maybe 1 out of 10 times) are made as movie sequeces where your action is reduced to move left/right and jumping/shooting at the right moment. If you fail a sequence, the game has always been saved just before, so you have no worries. You can do them again and again untill you get them right. These sequences are often used to end some chapter with a nice cinematically presentation to move you further on in the story. Although simplistic in gameplay they are often very beautifully made and with tense action. You often discover that you were holding your breath during the sequence. There are also sidequests in the game, and although they are often just one single puzzle to solve, and not important for the game at all, you still feel a lot of joy and excitement just to have found the entrance to the sidequest.  Conclusion: The game has tons of hours of story, gathering plants, shooting and skinning animals, upgrading your weapons, finding GPS and boxes, bossfighting, shooting amulets and mines and so on. You really feel the enormous developing team behind this game. The game is huge, and have a very high quality. I don't think I ever encounted even a single error in this game. Buy it if you loved the previous Tomb Raider games, or if you like this type of game. Its among the best in its genre.",

The benefits include a fantastic new story line which aims at giving this reboot (1 of the 2) a new, more personalized, character while providing the standard 'tomb raiding' benefits. In similar regard, the graphics are quite fantastic and not excessively demanding on ones computer. My first run through of this game had the graphics all on low and it all worked, and looked, quite well. Since then, however, seeking those pesky achievements has never looked better. And in that regard, the negatives... Getting 100% achievement rate is next to impossible. You will need help to find some of the challenges, for one. Even then, some will take forever... The biggest downside, however, with this game is the multiplayer which is essentially non-existent. I feel the developers should have added a 'bot based' multiplayer option which would allow for 1 or 2 humans to have a good multiplayer game to get those other achievements. Or something, who knows...  Nevertheless! If you're a fan of story (it's somewhat half-life-esque in terms of 'do this, then this, oh then you need to do this! All while looking for these...'), shooting (the shooting system isn't 'ideal' in terms of responsiveness, but it definitely works), and seeing some totally unbelievable albeit really cool things. Then go no further...  For the price (5-10), it's basically playing a good novel.",

Compared to Deus Ex, where you stay hidden because things are easier that way (but you can still take on a military bot and a few bad guys all by yourself if you choose), here stealth is the only way to survive. Unfortunately, this game does pretty much the same evil thing Assasin's Creed did - it introduces collector's trophies, which are not exactly relevant to the completion of the game.  Also, not sure about the rest of language packs, but the english one sounds... strange at best, when that dude is trying to either kill you or ♥♥♥♥ you... whatever. If you, authors, meant him to be russian or something, at least hire a decent actor that knows the bloody language next time! I know, 90% of games, let alone Hollywood movies, are made by people who think they can make do with someone who knows a guy that knows a language specialist, but the results are always miserable. A game of this 'class' ought to do better.  Anyway, that's about it for now, more might come later as I actually finish this game. It's still worth playing, after all.",

            "review_text": "This was the biggest gaming surprise I’ve had in a while. I expected a lame rehash from a stale franchise. Instead, I’m happy to announce thatthat Tomb Raider is an incredibly fun and intense experience that has resurrected Lara Croft.  I played the original years ago and while it was fun at the time the formula got old quickly and I could not get interested in the sequels. It was roughly 90% intricate, drawn-out puzzles &amp; platforming with 10% miserable combat sprinkled in. What they’ve done is rebalance the game mechanics so it focuses much more on combat (which is oh-so-fluid) and the puzzles &amp; platforming are more of a side dish. I think this works because it keeps the game moving along.  For example, there are optional tombs you can raid, but they are very small areas with only one puzzle that won’t take you more than 10 minutes to solve. This is a little disappointing, I’ll admit. I would like to have a little more meat to the puzzles, but I will take the short ones over getting bogged down in a 45-minute labyrinth.  RPG elements have been introduced, as well. There is a lot of optional stuff you can do in this game which will yield experience to make Lara stronger through special skills as well as finding “salvage” which is used to improve your weapons in certain ways (more damage, less recoil, etc). Special journals can be found, too, which help to unravel the mystery of the island you’re on.  Another brilliant touch is how they’ve tweaked exploration. Each area has several sets of secrets to uncover but you don’t have to find them all before you move on (some will require items you don’t have yet, anyway). You discover campsites as you play and can fast travel between them. This lets you focus on having fun instead of feeling obligated to gut an area’s secrets right away to avoid a lengthy backtrack to an earlier area. It makes things so nice.  The game is gorgeous, too. Environments are beautiful &amp; smartly designed so they feel very open with lots of nooks &amp; crannies to peek in and usually multiple paths to traverse around obstacles.  As I mentioned earlier, combat is fluid and thrilling, the exact opposite of how it was in the original game. Head shots with fire arrows never get old, and the AI is smart. Ranged opponents will throw fire bombs to flush you out of cover or shoot guns at you while melee opponents will zip line in to close on you. And there are so many gratifying ways to kill them. Stick an arrow shaft through their neck with your hand at close range, dig your climbing axe into their back for a stealth kill, hit a guy right as he’s about to throw dynamite resulting in a friendly fire explosion, etc.  The story is very good, too. Games rarely make me want to play to find out what happens next anymore. Usually the story is something bland &amp; serviceable to keep me level grinding. I really like the narrative in TR, though. Quite unrealistic, of course, but still enjoyable.  And if you’re concerned, keyboard &amp; mouse controls work just fine. This is not one of those sloppy console ports that is unplayable w/out a gamepad.  The only knock I have against this game is the use of quick time events. QTEs are something I want to see go away and never come back. I am tired of the “press E to awesome” gameplay mechanic. However, Tomb Raider doesn’t rely too heavily on them and they are at least presented in a very dramatic way, so don’t listen to any commenters saying the game is nothing but cutscenes &amp; QTEs. The beginning is admittedly slow and has a lot of them, but that’s because you haven’t gotten your weapons yet. Once you get armed, you encounter them a lot less. The QTEs don’t ruin the game and only end up being a very minor annoyance.  There is also the obligatory multiplayer mode that all video games are apparently required by law now to include. I don’t know anything about it and I will probably never play it. It’s an extra thing if you want it, but know that the single player campaign is not lacking at all.  If you like action games, you should definitely pick this one up. Tomb Raider had lost several steps over the years but is now running like a more polished version of Playstation’s Uncharted series, with better combat &amp; storytelling. A very nice surprise that is worth your attention.",

BUT: - ZERO replay value from a campaign perspective- unless you like collecting crap to get achievements that have no real value. - DLC packs for skins are stupid- does that mean you going to play it again because you wearing different clothes? - Multiplayer..... seriously, there are better games for multiplayer than Tomb Raider.  I'd buy this purely because the story arc was such an epic journey (Look for it on Steam Sales), and if you looking to play a game casually for around 15hours or so because there's no Premier League on.",

It is clearly cribbing heavily from the Uncharted series of games to understand how to do the Tomb Raider format better than Tomb Raider has ever managed before, adding in an open world sandbox aspect, and replacing Nathan Drake with the person he originally replaced. The genius of the game design is not in being new or original though, but rather in taking those old mechanics and refining them to perfection.   However, more importantly than them getting the mechanics right, they got the story right. It draws you in, and drags you along. The quality of the writing is everything that you could hope for, and it pulls off the trick of feeling extremely cinematic, but doing so in a way that would never actually work in a movie. Rhianna Pratchett shows the deft touch of the consumate artist who is at the top of her game and understands the strengths of the medium she is working in, even as she plays with the tropes and clichés that would have sunk a lesser writer. To her credit, those very same tropes and clichés not only do not feel tired and over-used, but the fact that they would be so tired and over-used elsewhere actually plays in to setting the right tone and mood for this game. Like a true master, she takes what is death to other lesser artists, and makes beauty from what others would discard. ",

It's basically 3rd person shooting unless you get into close combat. The best part of the game is the exploration. The island looks incredible. On max graphics it lagged my fancy gaming computer so I had to lower the settings and it still looked great. Tomb puzzles were imaginative. They had an almost Zelda feel to them.

Firstly, the graphics, and Tomb Raider certainly does not disapoint. From the moment you are given control of Lara, staring out over the shipwrecked coast of the island of Yamatai, the lanscapes are completely stunning. This continues throughout the game, with a good variety of environments, from lush forests to the stone interior of a world war two bunker.  The controls are great and make navigating lara through the semi-open world environment a joy, from scaling large radio towers, to zip-lining down mountainsides. Furthermore the combat, always the weakest part of the series, has been completely changed, with the auto aim replaced by third person shooter mechanics, fun melee finishing moves and stealth sections which are fun, although this approach can not be chosen and is instead forced upon you in certain moments.   The story is solid, though not the strong point of the game. Although the characters all feel different enough from each other, they are all fairly one dimensional other than Lara herself, who develops well throughout the game from frightened victim, to hardy survivor, and is voice acted solidly and convincingly.   The puzzles are interesting and serve to break up the combat well, but unfortunately this is exactly their purpose: to break up the combat sections. For a game series which has traditionally been about puzzling, it was sad to see the emphasis lifted so heavily from this element of the game and this is my biggest criticism. For fans of the action/adventure genre, who occasionally like a break from the combat, I highly recommend this game, however long-time fans of the series may be disapointed by the lack of lengthy and difficult puzzles.   Overall, I would recommend this game for its great graphics, good combat system and most of all the sheer fun of controlling lara. Although the story is not the strongest and the puzzle elements feel like they could have been fleshed out, it is overall a fun experience and it's good to see Lara back.",

I tried it on the unsupported NVIDEA GeForce 8800 GS, and nothing rendered but Lara's hair, water, and fire along with trees etc. No actuall textures rendered such as the walls of the cave you start off in, and the ground.

In many ways it's merely catching up with the compitition, but with a surprisingly deep combat system, and the fact that it's TombRaider it seems to be able to edge just an inch ahead of the rest. In the end you get a extremly polished AAA action explorer game, with a fun and rewarding combat system.  The only problem to be had is in respect to whether it's in fact Tomb Raider, and how simular it is to the Uncharted franchise. Really the new game layout bares more in common with an Uncharted game with a girl then the next Lara. The latest Tomb Raider has little to non of the series past actual Tomb Raiding, non of the alternate costumes and general fan service of the past entries. This, much like the removal of the sex appeal of past entries is a matter of opinion of the player. Note however, that though the sex appeal has been toned down/removed, the violence is fairly extreme. Though it attempts to give you the idea that Lara is young and vulnerable, almost immediatly she is executing people with shotgun blasts to the face, and stabbing people in the throat. So if big boobs offend you more then gang style executions, you'll be right at home.  In conclussion Tomb Raider is an amazing comeback for this aging franchise bringing fresh life into it's whithered bones. As a franchise Crystal Dynamics has a chance to lead the pack, if they can out pace the likes of Uncharted and Assassins Creed.",

            "review_text": "Pretty decent experience. The opening minutes are harrowing and there are multiple occassions throughout the game where that feeling comes back in full force.  I do have to say, the game was at its best when all I had was a flimsy bow and I crapped myself whenever enemies were nearby because well, it wasn't exactly easy to fight them off. That only really held true at the beginning, however. Once you start getting weapons and upgrades, you become pretty damned unstoppable, and that feeling of utter menace you got from the environment simply vanishes. The only things that can really kill you, after a point, are the awesome set pieces where you have to scramble lest the ground beneath your feet crumbles and you die.  The weapon variety and upgrades were nice, but I mostly stuck to the bow and arrow, and wish that really would've been the only thing available to us. Maybe the handgun too. That combined with a greater emphasis on not being seen and getting Lara through situations by using more creative level design so that the whole game isn't one big freakin' shootout could have elevated it from being a good game to being a great one.  [spoilers] I mean, the disbelief increases steadily and exponentially as the game progresses, and nice little details like the journals of soldiers getting decimated by Oni and the stormguard etc could have made the whole experience that much more frightening and harrowing if those spooky bits of lore were substantiated by actual danger. I loved Lara's impetuous screams of 'see if you can stop me you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!' but come on... a bunch of well trained soldiers got decimated by these things but one little girl on her first adventure mowed them all down with a vengeance?  There's a degree of believability at the beginning that I found really enthralling and got me hooked, but the game dispelled it completely by the end. That's not to say it wasn't fun.  What kept me going was the exploration, and how creative you could get using environments to your advantage in a fight. It was really easy to just find a nice fox hole and kill everything in sight, but damn was it fun to just run out there and tear it up.  All in all, a good game, and a good start on the revival of the series. Looking forward to seeing where they take it.",

As far as i am concerned there is no place in tomb raider for QTE's, and if there is a place for them, this is exactly how not to implement them. I get it i am about to get attacked by a ♥♥♥♥♥ wolf and i have to press certain buttons in the right order at the right time. Miss a button press, wait for the death animation, then restart the whole damn thing again...and again...etc. Are they difficult, not really, but they are definately not fun.

I can only hope that future titles can carry on what this team of people brought to the series and find ways to improve on what they built here.

To me, this is a game of exploration. The physical puzzles and combat are secondary to the discovery of new places, documents and relics. We all know Lara Croft, sometimes we forget that she is an archaeologist. This game describes how she became the Tomb Raider of legend and I loved the ride. The game is defined by the tiny details that help make the experience immersive. Lara will, when jogging through a forest or through a narrow tunnel, reach out a hand as she passes a tree or to fend off a wall. Her clothing deteriorates as the game progresses, rents and mud and blood from her very physical activities having their deleterious effect. As she gets wounded her vision blurs and she moves a little more slowly; no health bars on screen. If she detects bad guys she ducks into a crouch, a position in which she stays until the threat is ended. I would call the combat cover-based but you don't need to press buttons to enter/exit cover. If she enters her combat crouch and nears appropriate cover she uses it. Later in the game enemy fire will destroy cover, as will your own, so combat becomes much more dynamic. If you want to stay alive you have to learn to stay mobile. While the story is linear there are fast travel points scattered liberally over the map that you can move between at will once discovered, allowing you to search for those things you may have missed. Using them, I was able to achieve 100% completion on my playthrough. I could go on and on about the things I loved about this game but I'll try to sum up my experience. I came to care about Lara and her journey of survival and sacrifice and I felt privileged to be allowed to help her on her way. If that's not an immersive game experience I don't know what is.",

The story is entertaining, the movement feels fluid, it looks and sounds nice, and they made a decent attempt to make the main character actually feel like a person rather than a nameless badass slaughtering endless enemies... Well, mostly.  You start off feeling entirely helpless, but the game eases you into things well enough, even if that means several mechanics that might seem important are touched on once or twice later, and then never again. The characters are about 'what you see is what you get', but even though there is a twist or two that you'll see coming a mile away, they might surprise you a bit with how decently written they are. Lara herself feels like an actual, ordinary person accomplishing extraordinary feats, which is enjoyable until later on, when you begin killing dozens of enemies as if they were nothing, breaking down any 'challenge' or 'ethics' that might've stressed you earlier. What I'm trying to say is that, as the game goes on, there is a slowly increasing dissonance between what you're doing in-game and what the game says is happening. But that's okay, it's not a huge deal.  If there is anything I could rag on, it's the sheer amount of firepower you get later on. You have access to more than four ways of brutally murdering people, and ammo is seeming always there when you need it most; a stark contrast to the first couple of levels where you're struggling to get enough arrows to consistently deal with threats. Any sort of scavenging you might do is eventually reduced to searching the fifty bodies you just killed to fill your ammo back up.  But enough of the negatives. It's a good game, and one I would certainly recommend if you have an aching for a new platformer.",

Lara has to fight to survive and save her friends, all while uncovering the secrets of an ancient kingdom. A very detailed game. The scenery is amazing, the combat is well developed, and the story is powerful as it shows Lara changing from a green explorer to the hardened adventurer that we've come to know and love from the other games.

            "review_text": "Usually, 'reboot' is synonymous with cash-grabs and low-key imitations of the original material. I'm glad that Tomb Raider 2013 didn't fall for that. Instead Crystal Dynamics have opted for a more modern, Uncharted-esque stance on what made Lara Croft special. The result is reasonably impressive but it won't please the fans of the old formula for many reasons : the title notwithstanding 'Tombs' are actually....optional.  Yeah you read that right a Tomb Raider game which isn't about raiding tombs, secondly the tone of the game has radically changed. In TR2013 we are talking about a grittier approach which dovetails nicely with the modern videogame audience which doesn't reward truthfulness to the source material. Dare I say the majority have only heard of Tomb Raider. Admittedly I was a little bit put off by the sheer amount of violence on display, the narrative didn't give me the impression that all this gore was warranted. It didn't really fit. Gameplay wise this is a rather standard third-action game featuring a agile cover system, gunfights and puzzles resolving. If there is one complain that many have made about the game is that the XP system is tacked on and doesn't really bring anything meaningful to the game, and it's weird to see boxes waiting to be salvaged in such an environnement. The XP system is put in place to stay in the loop so to speak, to mirror what Far Cry 3 or other games have implemented.   If you have played and liked Uncharted there is a good chance you might be thrilled by this reboot of the franchise. I can't say it's quite as impressive as Uncharted 1/2/3 in terms of pacing and writing but it's definitely a game worth playing and not a mere Uncharted knock off. Lara is definitely not the same but she remains a likeable character, some might not like her somewhat american accent but newcomers won't be bothered in the least.  7/10. Recommended. ",

Now this isn't GTA but somehwhere inbetween Uncharted and the old Tomb Raiders but on a single island. The Lara we're introduced to is unsure and vulnerable but as the story progresses the writing shines as we see her grow into a pretty strong heroine. This is made better by really good voice acting (for the most part) so it's hard not to be engrossed for the entire length of the story. With great gameplay, story, characters, music and a gaggle of PC tweaking options this game is nothing short of great.",

The artifacts and documents you collect also adds a little more to the story and every artifact you collect from modern to ancient times broadens your imagination and has a voiced-description of Lara. This game really makes you think of how thrilling it is to be an archaeologist. If this was a movie, this would have been a blockbuster hit in the theaters. Though the multiplayer is a ghost town but if you have friends you can have a private match or coop.

            "review_text": "Before this the only other Tomb Raider game I had played was Underworld. (which I only played about half of because it was borrowed) It was good I suppose other than the fact that I had to use a guide every so often for the puzzles and I felt pretty terrible about the way I had to perversely stare at Lara's tightly exposed ♥♥♥♥ the entire time as she backflips over endangered species whilst promptly shooting them in the face. Kinda makes you have to turn the screen off everytime someone enters the room.  Anywho, I did not have to turn off the screen or use puzzle guides in Tomb Raider 2013 because this game takes itself a lot more seriously and I had less of a hard time with the puzzles.  The new, rebooted Lara can be taken a lot more seriously because she seems to have much more of a human personality now and dresses a lot more realistically too. Her personality and character are complimented by the situations she has to go through and the strong story and setting around her. The majority of the game's puzzles are entirely optional as 'Tombs' which can subsequently be 'Raided' mostly for weapon upgrades of various kinds. I'm not sure if the puzzles are now easier or if I'm simply smarter than I was back when I played Underworld.  Let's be honest, it's probably the former. Nonetheless, I felt great when I accomplished a puzzle tomb and the snazzy weapon upgrade was nice always nice too. The action in the game is pretty awesome, the game becomes less and less scripted as you go along but even so, you'll never complain about a scripted moment later on because they're so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kick-♥♥♥ in your face. The gameplay is split between the platforming (which will become more and more advanced as Lara acquires new tools and equipment to help her)  ...and the combat (most of which you can choose to handle stealthily with melee, silenced guns and your bow OR you can go crazy with your machinegun and upgraded fire-breathing shotgun) All is handled awesomely and feels incredibly fluid and smooth using an adaptive cover system where Lara will crouch, stand and lean exactly when she needs to without the player having to do anything but move her there. The open world is pretty interesting. If you've played a game like Dark Souls then you'll be familiar. Large, open areas liniarly connected. Also containg bonfires from which you can upgrade, level up and fast travel. The whole world looks freakin' amazing too, you'll get a lot of situations where you can see somewhere in the distance that you can get to, if you can't then you can return to the area later on with new equipment and try again. A lot of the time you'll find explorable, puzzle filled tombs this way. Incase you can't tell by the essay of a review I have here: I love this game. The only complaint I have is that there isn't all that much to do after completing the main story other than find the remaining tombs which feels pointless because I have little use for upgrading weaponry after the main story where the wide majority of the enemies are fought. So if you get this game I'd also reccomend any DLC available provided that it's good and substantial. I'm not sure how good the game is on other difficulties but I'd reccomend highest difficulty on your first playthrough because with the stealth approach I died pretty rarely.  Too long, didn't read?

            "review_text": "I got this game on sale and it is my favorite game from 2013. At it's heart it is an easy third-person shooter on normal difficulty. Superficially it's a plot-based survivor game aiming for graphical realism (but not tedium). It's extremely simplified RPG elements (need to find next major equipment upgrade to progress) but no inventory to worry about (beyond ammo). The plot is a little corny/obvious but good enough that I never once felt like 'oh, so that the next plot device to delay my progress for another level'. Laura did not earn a single complaint from my girlfriend for being too fake, so that's a plus. Her early-game whining made me shout at the screen a few times though. Level design is fantastic and always fresh; it can be easy to get lost. Jumping is easy and there are simple climbing/ledge mechanics. There very few timing puzzles aren't bad enough to make you want to rage-quit, in fact the puzzles are pretty basic. There are only four guns in the game (always available once earned), plus a mid-game mellee addition, but they easily made the bow my favorite. They can be incrementally (lightly) upgraded as you go. Falling damage will kill you if you fall far enough (or 'out of bounds').  For the completionist: It gave me 31 hours of completionist enjoyment for the single player alone (only getting the optional dungeon as DLC). Spam that 'survival instinct' skill (Q) like it's your job. You may have to save at the campsite and reload to finish that DLC tomb because jumping onto the plane got buggy (reload fixed it). Chatterbox is an easy-to-miss achievement, but almost everything else can be 'gone back for' after the game's ending. The only thing you can't repeat (and don't need to) are cut-scene levels like swimming down some river rapids, dodging tree branches, for example (which is the closest I came to wanting a rage quit). Recommend upgrading survivor skills first if you're a completionist... but you'll end up getting all skills and upgrades by the end if you make a bit of effort.  I would have been fine paying $30 for this game, but for most folks I'd put it at a $15 (or less) value (including the optional tomb DLC).",

            "review_text": "This game scored 2 / 5 in my opinion. If your interested in why, read the review below, or just read the conclusion if you want the main points. Keep in mind this is my first tomb raider game, and the review is based solely on the campaign of this game, of the original edition.  Graphics:   The opening cut scene was stunning to watch, I thought it was real for a moment at a few parts. However after that, the graphics switch to the game play graphics which was still great to look at, although not the same, and they translated fine from the cut scene.    In a few of the high elevation areas in the game, If you just take a second or two and look at the island laid out before you, it is very beautiful to look at. Same could be said for a few of the low elevation areas, where you can get a good view of the mountains and the temples on them.   Game play:   Switching to game play graphics the whole game, saved loading time for cut scenes and allowed for upgrades you did to weapons to be seen in the cut scenes. Doing this also allowed for QTE (quick time event) to be used, however, almost every cut scene was a QTE, this rubbed me the wrong way. To many QTEs don't allow you to show off the games graphics, but rather make a player focus on pressing a button. Which brings me to the point, several of the QTEs state to “Mash” a certain button, where in truth you are to lightly press the button at a steady internals. Don't get me wrong these can be fun in certain games, but I like to watch my cut scene, especially in games I viewed as more causal. Although I know not many people may share this opinion of Tomb raider being a casual game.    Continuing on with other aspects, the gun play, so as aiming and upgrading your arsenal, was very well thought out. When you kill an enemy with a certain kind of weapon, they were more likely to have that ammo on them to pick up. Also gathering certain parts to upgrade certain weapons, mixed with the random scrap you pick up through out the game felt real. As well as certain weapons working best in certain situations. The shotgun worked best for “tank” units, rifle for fighting a group of targets, your pistol for dark areas that required a torch to be carried in one hand. Finally a bow to silently dispatch enemies and attach ropes to far places.   The game was very action orientated, this sadden me. After all for a game series I always heard was puzzled based with relativity hard puzzles, this game was no where near it. As a new player to the franchises I was very disappointed about this, as most of the tombs were optional, and these were the main parts that had the puzzles. The game was more of a run and gun through areas then climbing, more ducking and weaving behind cover to kill a group of enemies, then more climbing or crawling in tight spaces. The puzzles that did exist where extremely simple and lacking any type of challenge.   The Survivor Vision mechanic was useful when you had no idea were you where going, and it also let you know what you could interact with. The bad thing about this was that at certain parts, such as dark areas, were you are meant to have no real idea of where you were going. You could “cheat” and use the vision and have a clear layout of the room and where to go, as it would light up the darkness.  Audio:   The small sounds of this game were very good, such as bumping into a metal drum that could be moved around, it actually sound like you had run into a hollow metal drum. The voice acting was also very good, the voicing over was good to. You could follow the lips of characters in cut scenes and “see” the words they spoke.  Characters/Story/plot:   The fresh take on Lara Croft was well done in my opinion, keeping to the roots of a bad-♥♥♥, sexy, yet human character that felt real to the player (MOST OF THE TIME). The character design of the other character is good, and the ability to find the “notes” from certain characters was a good thing for people that like to dig into a games back story.   The Story itself is original, but it falls short of what most people expect in games today that are story driven. The main reason it falls short is because of the completely unrealistic series of unfortunate events that befalls Lara and the gang. I am not talking about the supernatural factor, that part is well done. However the unrealistic amount of ♥♥♥♥ that falls on them is to far out, where is the hope? The moments of build up of tension, then release of horrible events. Where is the actually plot twist and turns, that no one sees. They tried a story of high tension and survival, with the idea that your always on your toes, but they fail.    At one point they even take Lara Croft and place her out of character, to fall for an event that not only from a player perceptive, but from an in-game Lara Croft perceptive you can see it going to happen in the game. You could argue that because this is Lara “first” adventure (since its a reboot) that she is naïve of the world. Which in some cases the game designers do well to show this off in the game, when she goes through all this horrible events that befall her. However, this does not mean that she cannot see the actions of the person in front of her that will lead to a certain event that will transpire. I cannot buy that someone who when through college, that is in their mid twenties, had a well studied father, and is well studied themselves, can fall for such an event that is right before their eyes, regardless of the situation.   This brings me to my next point, they even start to destroy the image/character of Lara Croft by setting up a relationship between her and another main female character that has heavy undertones of possible lesbian relationship. I understand that this is a reboot of Lara Croft for a modern world, and that the designer have a character that Lara and her have a close relationship, so that Lara has a reason to care about trying to save her. Whether the lesbian undertones is intentional or not, I feel this takes away from Lara Crofts original character core. Then again this is a fresh face, and they are the designers, so maybe they will run with this and it will turn out to be something great instead of just poor story telling.  Conclusion and other notes:    The graphics were amazing to watch, I didn't like how almost all the cut scenes were QTEs. I especially hated the wording of how you were meant to interact in the QTEs. The gun play of the game was well done, however for a game title I personally would view as a causal game to play there was a lot of Action, and a little bit of adventuring. The puzzles I did expect to play, were few and far between, those that did exist were poorly constructed and were not challenging puzzles.   The Audio of the game was well made for a game that had no music in the background. The characters were well done, until you come to the point where Lara Croft is ripped out of character to fall for an event that in game she should be able to see. The story premise was good, but the execution of it was poor with the constant horrible events happening to the characters, with out any build up, real reason, or pause for a moment of breath for the story to sink in. For a game that is driven by story it falls flat on its face.   All in all, it adds up to be a 2 / 5 game in my opinion.  I played the normal edition on max settings, hard difficulty. I didn't try multiply player, as I had no interest in it.",

The story is quite good but could have been drawn out a bit more to make the evolution seem smoother. At a few times the game can be a bit challenging if you’re struggling with trying to do something and that it is unfortunately programed to not let you do (or do it differently). It’s too bad that QTEs are still in games today; however, this game utilizes actions in normal gameplay as QTEs and vice versa to the point that they become innate.

It doesn't introduce a whole lot of fresh ideas, but manages to be very frun from one moment to the next, with enough distractions in between to make the world feel open without being overwhelming. The gmaeplay is very reminiscent of the Uncharted series--bombastic scripted action sequences, linear platforming, the occasional environmental puzzle, and cover-based combat. Two things I really appreciated on the combat side was to cover system, which is entirely contextual, and the melee, which introduced a lot of different kinds of moves and dynamic finishers. Rather than dodging, Lara scrambles out of the way, which ties in well with the theme of 'leaning to survive by any means necesary' that pervades the narrative.  While much of what happens to Lara can be brutal and ugly, the graphics are absolutely gorgeous. Hands-down, with the settings turned up, this is the best-looking PC game I've played. That said, my water-cooled GTX 780 was really chugging during the most demanding parts. But, Lord, was it worth it. So much pretty.  The sound design and music were all great, too, and highlighted the intense action sequences very well. Overall, I felt like the story was tight and focused without quite being as much of an interactive movie as, say, Max Payne. The combat arenas tend to have just enough variety to make me feel like I'm making decisions.  As usual, I didn't try the multiplayer, so I can't speak to its quality.  For the completionists out there, the collectibles are pretty cool and there are lots of different types. Most have story-based components, and a lot can be picked up throughout the main quest. I got almost 100% with the exception of one combat-related achievement that relies on attacking an enemy at exactly the right time and also depends on the placement of other enemies. So, that one was annoying. Naturally, I have no insights into the multiplayer achievements.  A fine, fine first foray for the new Lara Croft. I look forward to the next. Between this and Sleeping Dogs, I've been quite impressed with Square Enix as of late. Then again, they're still making Final Fantasy titles, right? ",

The story is okay, but you kill so many people so efficiently that Lara's disbelief at what she is doing wears thin a little quickly. The first kill is believably world-changing for her, but after that you pickoff bad guys as though she does this every day, with not a lot of remorse or reflection being meaningfully shown. I found that the best bits of the story are, interestingly enough, in the optional collectibles. You get a good sense of the crazy nature of the island from picking up journals and, to a lesser extent, the artifacts.  The game's biggest problem for me was its overreliance on quick time events. Get in close with an enemy? QTE. Hit a ledge after a long jump? QTE. Finish a boss? QTE. Any game that regularly instructs you to 'mash F to ____' should take a step back and reconsider some mechanics.

There are a few Quick Time Events that get annoying... they were a bit unclear as to when to strike the key. (Wait til the larger circle shrinks into the smaller one... then mash the button they tell you to!) Also the 'mash this button to pry open...' got annoying.

Even with the combat being really good. There's just barely any enemies to fight or shenanigans to be had after you 100% it. I just wish they'd have gone for more options endgame in it. Some spoilers I can't reveal, but the enemies you face close to the end of the game is some of the coolest enemies I've ever had the enjoyment of fighting against. As shortlived as those fight sequences are at the whole scope of the game. It certainly could've been a gaming classic if only it had more replay value, endgame and just, more fun stuff to do. Because everything is fantastic until it's all done and over.  Still. Really good game. Exploration and combat is really fun. It's a more casual Dishonored to me. Which is a game that has endless replay value and even better combat to pretty much perfection of that genre. But Tomb Raider is still a fantastic game and will definitely surprise you if you didn't expect anything going into it.",

The second is that I have to do button sequences properly or I die. The third was the immense puzzles and intricate world that I found myself in. The depths of a jungle, with wild wolves circling me for dinner. Ruined castles and frigid mountain tops to explore and survive the dangers of. This reimagining of Lara Crofts adventures was not only sorely needed, but brilliantly executed. Just like the headshots you can kill enemies with.  Find and upgrade weapons, loot animals for exp, use the environment to take our enemies. They're all familiar mechanics in a platformer survival game, but this game is amazing, and I'm genuinely glad I purchased it.",

This game is more dark and mature featuring a young frightened Lara drenched in blood learning to kill to survive. Still you have the running, jumping, shooting, climbing ledges in fluid animations. Areas connect almost linear but you can come back for collectibles.  Features: The awesome graphics will immerse you in the game for example when you climb a radio tower. When young Lara gets penetrated by an iron spike you automatically flinch. (game is a bloodbath) I took screenshots all the time - nice wallpapers. Usually I'm not a graphic-mad gamer but here it's the main selling point beside some really satisfying combat and mildly difficult puzzles. A hint of RPG with some perks to unlock on level up.  Recommended for fans of action-adventure gameplay (Tomb Raider series, Prince of Persia) -climbing and shooting. Beware there's no replay value here except higher difficulty so wait for a sale.

This most certainly a mature title due to the store and the blood and gore. While she may be an archeologist for the majority of the game Laura is fighting for her life and scrambling to get buy. There are some very challenging battles, but none of them feel unfair. There are a few quick time events, however they are done better than most and don't detract in most cases. The story and voice acting is excellent though a few of the characters are a bit predictable.   You still have tombs to discover and explore and the jumping/climbing mechanics work very well. The gun play is excellent with a nice selection of weapons and a good upgrade system that rewards you for exploring the island.

After that, the only character development we get is; she has tombs to exploer. Yes we see her grow stronger and more dependant but the turning point happens too quickly.  As lara is stranded on an island her only tools are items she finds around the island to craft to make bows, spares etc, as well as guns left by previous enhabitants. Great machanic, but I only found myself using it once to make the bow and arrow that is nesersery. Other than that, your guns and bow and and arrow will get you through and there is no real need to want to craft more items.  Multiplayer... its there....  Other than the lack luster multiplayer and the tombs to exploer, there is no real reason to come back to want to play this game unless you are a completionist. I finished the story and loved it! Want more... tried multiplayer once... never player the game since.

The free-climbing felt better and more precise than Assassin's Creed. It has more open environments than Uncharted. The only minor flaws in my opinion is the unreasonable shaky camera in some cutscenes (during gameplay the camera is always spot on and very well positioned).  The skill and upgrade-system seems interesting at first but since you easily unlock everything by the end it seems kinda pointless.  The story starts out well and promising. Lara Croft is likeable and excellent cutscenes are showing her as a growing personality that is struggling with her situation. Unfortunately the game itself turns these cutscenes ad absurdum when you are a walking killing-machine that recovers health constantly. The overall plot is interesting and I enjoyed listening to all sidenotes and journals, but it is too predictable and doesn't offer any surprises. The voice-acting is excellent for every character as well.  All in all it is a highly enjoyable game and probably one of the best titles this year. Definitely worth more than the 10$ sale price.  Sidenote: Multiplayer seems dead for this game. Too bad.",

The bad things I stumpled across was the way to short tombs you find. Wished there had been alot more to them and the puzzles was way to easy.

The gameplay is pretty decent it feels like Tomb Raider that aspect of the game has not died.  I also really like what they have done with Lara shes still y'know the same Lara we've always known but this time we're going way back to before she was fully exploring or atleast went into trouble whilst exploring. Major things happen in the first 20 minutes of playing the game and you really see the character develope. Over a few short minutes of gameplay and some QTE's  I would have to say my fave part of the game so far is probably sneaking around when their are enemy soliders on patrol and you are using your bow to freak them out, the AI is good for that as they actually do get scared and start to search for you and speak about what is happening.

That is thankfully not the case here and has the best of a good television series where each cliffhanger leads to the next feeding that euphoria just enough to still want more.  The game makes excellent use of the Tomb Raider series, the icons of the series are not overplayed and come in at just the right moment to give that 'hell yeah!' feeling.  Each puzzle/combat segment is interlaced with story and cutscenes so that each part never feels like they overstay their welcome.

The game auto-saves at checkpoints, of which there are many, throughout the game so you never really have to back track very far if you find yourself acquainted with one of the game's many gruesome death sequences.  I felt that the bow was the most satisfying weapon with the pistol coming in a close second, and on normal difficulty ammo scarcity wan't an issue until the final confrontation. The characters were wonderfully fleshed out and I can't wait to continue down this rebooted series. The game is gorgeous and most of the environments feel like actual environments and not just set pieces. Climbing the radio tower was one of my favourite scenes.

Tomb Raider remedies this by providing stand out gameplay, skill/weapon customisation, lots of things to find throughout the environment and a good story to boot. This truely is a great fun game and in some ways, it even out-shines the Uncharted series. It feels very much like a cross between an open world RPG and a third-person action game.

Excellent controls, gorgeous graphics (especially when pumped up to max), and a compelling protagonist make this a fantastic experience. I would highly recommend this game to those who are fans of adventure/platforming games with a strong cinematic emphasis. Think Uncharted with a female protagonist who is strong, intelligent, and a legitimate character who isn't there as a damsel in distress. She's strong, motivated, and extremely capable. Part coming-of-age, part fantasy adventure, this game is an incredible testament to having a female protagonist in a game that is not simply there for pure T&amp;A factor.  My complaints are few, but pointed. Quicktime events happen fairly regularly, and are extremely infuriating. Often, the QTE happen during what seems to be a cutscene and ends up giving you an untimely and unavoidable death. Once you realize the cutscene was a lead-up to the QTE, you attempt to hit the appropriate keys (oftentimes without really being told WHICH key to hit), and then if you don't respond within what seems like a half-second, you hit your untimely and unavoidable death. The QTE segments really seem to be an exercise in Memory - die, remember the keypress for the next go, die at the next prompt, rinse and repeat. I'm never a huge fan of QTE because it's never a skill-based moment in the game; I always feel it's better to just leave it as a cutscene than to unnecessarily kill the character due to the player not realizing they need to start mashing buttons. I think, in the end, it may just be a more resounding issue of higher-fideclity gaming and engrossing players in a cinematic experience. The trnasition between cutscene and QTE should be more obvious if the developer believes using the QTE crutch is necessary for the storytelling.  Overall, a very hearty recommendation! This is not a game you should wait for the bargain bin unless you absolutely cannot afford $20 for an absolutely fantastic gaming experience.",

Instead, the game changes into Gears of War with Lara Croft... albeit a little more dynamic as you are required to move around more frequently as the enemies have ways of getting you out of cover.

Therein lies what bothers me. It may actually be a very good console game but not a good PC game. To be fair this is not the worst game I have ever played. In fact the second half is quite good. This justifies the thumbs-up. Just a pity the first half is so terrible. I would say that this game is not for serious gamers. It may be very acceptable for a pickup every now and then.  Tomb Raider should be all about exploring, searching for loot, solving puzzles and fantastic locations. Although the game has some of that its more about the action.   The good:  1. Mmmm.. nothing really stands out.  2. There are some nice locations but way too little. Most of the scenery is very standard.  3. Some cool loot. Unfortunately most loot is pointless other than for the achievement.  4. The second half action is quite good.   The bad:  5. Adapted form console, the camera does not flow freely.  6. Very linear game play. Although you have to go back to the few locations to get all the collectibles because you don't have the gear required yet. Very irritating.  7. The game looks good mostly, however Lara and other characters looks like a wax dolls. Skin tone and textures are console like.  8. Why is there a crouch button? It does not work. Lara crouches when she feels it is necessary.  9. Lara keeps on lighting a torch and switching to the pistol. I had to reselect my weapon the whole time.   The Ugly:  10. Some of the most pointless cut-scenes I have ever seen.  11. Be warned some of the death scenes are way too gross. Not for me. There are also heaps and heaps of blood and corpses; amazing number of corpses for a remote island.  12. Awful button pressing sequence scenes. This may work on console but not on PC.",

            "review_text": "all in all a decent game. If your looking for a classic tomb raider feel well . . . your going to come up short but if you take it as a stand alone game it's graphically appealing, has approachable mechanics and the pacing is decent It also has a solid plot for this type of game.  The downsides, I want to be delicate here which is not my strong suit, but I do this because this game shows a LOOOOT of conceptual potential which can and I feel will inspire later games to refine what they have done here. None of the mechanics are really new, but the way they are used is fresh to me. That said.  Much (To much) of the game was a series of win or try again timing minievents. think GoW boss battles where you have to hit a move that flashes up or you loose your footing and maybe a little life. The way it is used here if you fail you usually have to restart the fight after a bloody death and posibally some dialogue. On the plus side death has little to no meaning as you may just back up 30 sec or so to the start of the cinamatic you were playing. ALL major battles in the game are like that. and the button commands are not displayed over the action at times so you may not see it come up. Which brings up another issue.  due to the quality of the game and the cut scenes it is imposible to tell where one ends and the other starts, this can and will get you killed. as you do not realise you are now incharge of saveing your skin.  There are some areas where by walking in you are automatically noticed, this KILLS the cynamatic tension and mood to that point. and it is counter productive to the hard enforced stealth to survive mechanic.  there is a lot of discovery in this game but the discovery seems shoehorned into the most liniar story I have seen in a long time, this is not a strictly bad thing, you have an established character and a single end in mind but in a more modern sense this seems like a step back. Yes it was done to keep the plot on track and keep the near movie feel. which I say CAN work. but games as an interactive medium need agency or at least a sense of agency. here they have the right tools but they are useing them to often or to strictly and all to often taking the action away from The player only to hand it back without notice.  The camp menu, well it's a mess. it looks neat but does not function all that well. some screens have clickable areas to go back, others you have to use escape. while there are icons to indicate what menu you are in there is not always a way to tell where the menu you want is without memorisation, they do not loop so you will eventually hit an invisible menu wall  there was a hunger mecanic used early on for plot reasons which was quickly dropped. While I agree that the mechanic was unnessary, as a general rule of thumb if you are going to force a player to use a mecanic that mecanic is canon and beyond redaction. so use it regularly or never introduce it.  The Bow is your main weapon, a great all purpose stealthy weapon with very high stopping power. that doubles as a decoy maker, rope launcher, fire starter. For Laura's first adventure I would think she would never leave home without it. Yes Roth uses dual guns and yes you eventually get to use them also but serously as a survivalist I would be taking that bow to the grocery store after this experience. there is no emotional incentive for Ms. Croft to truely fall in love with the guns she is so well known for.  That's it for my griping. Good game Overly scrypted and cinamatic. but great plot and good character development.  I may sound grouchy but I give it a 7 out of 10",

This version is a fantastic 'origins' game with a young Lara Croft who must quickly grow up to use all her wits to survive and save her friends. The graphics are stunning and cutscenes well directed. The game play kept me well engaged with the traveling mechanics, from the parkour to the ziplines, and figuring out how to get to my destination and all the bonus items. There's a little sense of RPG with the skill points and which skill set to unlock first as well as the verious gear/weapon mod upgrades to select. Combat may involve stealthing, sniping, and sometimes you just have to get up close and personal to time your melee strikes. The only thing that took getting used to is when the cutscenes ended and game play begins. Don't hesitate to buy the GOTY edition. I'm looking forward to the next sequel. Overall: 9/10  Tip: If you've acquired all the bonus items and challenges but still finished the game at only 99% completion, then you'll want to fast travel to Shipwreck Beach and revisit the Cliffside Bunker (lower rightside of the map) since it's the only place that does not have a fast travel camp.

Being an adventure game, Tomb Raider includes a great number of secrets and areas to discover with lots of collectibles not always easily found. The plot is pretty simple and predictable, but it is a detail that you will not pay much attention to while playing. The game mainly focuses on scavenging items and fighting enemies. The former is actually a greater challenge than the latter, given the enemy AI which may tend to get ridiculous. However, if you like third-person platformer games with lots of walking around, jumping, collecting items, solving simple puzzles and finally, shooting, then you will be satisfied with what the game offers.

Gameplay is decent, the controllers are a bit messy but adequate. Difficulty is low, Lara can take more shots than a tank even at the highest difficulty (pretty sad as the enemies' AI is very good), and the puzzles are easy as hell so if you looking for a challenge go elsewhere. Also, too many scavenger hunts, gets tiring after a while.   DLC content isn't worth your while, a few outfits that I didn't use anyway and some multiplayer thingies that I have yet to play, and also another tomb. But tombs are pretty much a single puzzle with some XP and salvage as reward, and no real effect on the story, so... yeah.  Finally the game have some glitches. I just hate the need of having to break the gaming experience searching for a fix to a game-breaker bug, and this game have its good load of them.

            "review_text": "Overall rating: 9.5 out of 10  Gameplay: Combat is very intense and the gunplay is excellent. Entering any battle, Lara's actions and voice acting make the battle feel dangerous and important. Combat is cover-based, but it doesn't detract from the game because Lara can't take too much punishment (At least on Normal or Hard difficulty) and avoiding taking damage is often more important than dealing it. My personal favorite weapon was the pistol and upgrading it only made it more fun to use. Thankfully, weapons that did not receive as many upgrades were still useful in their own situations. Stealth is an option in TR and while it may not be the main focus of the title, it works well enough. Sneaking up on enemies is relatively easy but not being spotted by other enemies while taking out their friends is difficult. Using the bow to take out an entire area is extremely satisfying. If someone strays to far away, an arrow in the neck or head can remove them and strangling enemies in tall grass or bushes works as well. On a downside, alerting one enemy immediately alerts the entire area and they all run directly at you. Adventure exists but the game is very linear with only side paths. Personally, this did not detract from the game but others may be looking for more adventure. Thankfully, the game allows fast travel all over the island but usually it's just to find collectibles you missed or complete challenges.  Story: 'In our darkest moments, we find something to keep us going.' Lara starts off as an innocent archaeologist, but events on the island turn her into a hardened survivor willing to do whatever it takes to protect her friends and stay alive. All of the characters are very human and act/react accordingly. The death of a crewmate is blamed on others, killing results in disgust and fear, crewmates argue among each other as their confusion and fear grow, and while Lara emerges as a leader in the group, the others question and lash out at her. All in all, the characters are very realistic and easy to sympathize with, even the 'evil' ones.  Visuals: Absolutely stunning, this is definitely a high-fidelity AAA title and although my computer can only handle Ultra at 60fps, it looks incredible. Ultimate looks even better but I can't run it at 60fps. If you have a beefy PC, this game will look incredible and it still looks very good on the lower quality levels.",

The scenario of this came is well developed, the setting is rich in all its details, graphics are stunning and the possibilities to explore the island and do a lot more than just kill vilains or jump onto rocks, trees, boats and crashed planes are very well worked out. The same holds for the choice of foreign sound and music. Some of the action scenes are no less than thrilling, with the adrenaline flowing like hell. After finishing the game one feels compelled to go on exploring the island.

Anyway, even though the plot is pretty run-of-the-mill stuff, the delivery and craftsmanship of said plot sells it. You don't care that you've 'seen this movie before' because the character developement, acting, and the friggen scenery make it a remarkable journey (and sometimes downright heartpounding creepy).

What was once an iconic badass female Indiana Jones is now a run of the mill idiotic weakling. At no point in the game did I think 'yeah, that woman could kill a dragon.' or 'I bet if a T-Rex showed up, she'd have no problem with it.' The entire narrative is crafted by someone who loathes Lara as a character, and Tomb Raider as a franchise.  After all, it's called Tomb Raider and there aren't any real tombs. There are tiny puzzle rooms that would disappoint Wheatly with their simplicity. The gameplay used to be smarter. It used to be a third person puzzle game, now it's a third person shooter. Lara herself seems very dumb. It bothers me that I was able to put together the plot a good 4 or 5 hours before her. I was actually surprised when they devoted time to her realization. I couldn't help but think 'Really? She just realizes this now?' This stands in stark contrast to the original Lara who was usually informing the player of the situation. It felt like she was in control, but not anymore.  The politics are what really bug me about the game. Her main threat on this island is the white male and that threat is eventually replaced by rapey cannibal samurai. Any white male that is a good guy is basically a father figure, or a man-child. All of whom die for the sake of her character development. Can you be any more obvious? It's ham-fisted, cynical, and sloppy. Inverse the genders and suddenly this crap is unacceptably sexist. Yet here, there is a pretense of realism. A pretense created by Lara's redesign.   However, while Lara may be a idiotic weakling, you as the player never feel that way. While Lara may struggle in the narrative, you will cut a bloody swath through the island. The automatic cover system is surprisingly flawless, and traversal options make the game a seamless joy to play. The aiming, movement, and shooting feel like a vastly improved version of Uncharted. The guns have more punch. The game overall looks prettier. The aiming is perfect. The challenge is perfect.   This is a game that feels so good to play that I find myself going back to it over and over. I may moan over the poor writing, and I miss real Tombs, but it feels so good destroying everyone on that island. Counting the definitive version on the PS4, I must have played this a good 5 times this year. I've streamed it twice.  What makes a game isn't the politics it so obviously endorses, but the way it plays. And this game plays phenomenally. Overlook the SJW garbage and just enjoy the game part of the ♥♥♥♥ing game.  Worth it at 40 Dollars.",

The setting looked interesting but I wasn't sure how the gameplay would hold up, as I knew the game employed some quick time events, which are generally not an attractive feature in games. Turns out, this game was a great buy.  To start off, I really liked the fact that this game was a prequel to all other Tomb Raider/Lara Croft games, starting at the original adventure that helped her become who she is. It was really fun to see her character develop throughout the game from a simple archeologist to a battle hardened badass.  The setting and story for this game were amazing and engaging, and with maps and scenery to match. The bare bones of the story is that Lara and her friends, looking for a 'Lost Kingdom', end up crash landing on an unknown island in the Dragon's Triangle, which is described as the Bermuda Triangle of the Pacific Ocean. The land itself is strewn with ancient Japanese ruins which make the scenery beautiful and makes it feel like you're walking(and fighting) through history. Moreover, each section of the game is and feels unique and different from the previous sections as you traverse through the game. The story itself is based on a real historical legend/controversy, and it is very interesting to follow along as you help Lara unravel the mystery of the island and its savage inhabitants.  As for the gameplay, Edios and Square Enix have done a great job of striking a balance between combat sequences and puzzle sequences(as they did in Deus Ex: HR). The amount of combat sequences feels acceptable, as you are not constantly under siege but it is never completely absent from the game. The puzzles, both story -related and optional, are always fun to figure out but not too complicated. There are quite a few collectibles that give small bonuses and aren't particularly difficult to seek out if you wish. However, the game never forces you to go on 'collectible missions', which is a big plus, because nobody likes those. And yes, there are quick time events in this game, but it does not degrade the game 90% of the time, as they are mostly concentrated in the beginning or first half of the game. One or two can be frustrating when you die multiple times because you can't get the right key mashing down, but many of them are there in certain parts once or twice to help teach the player the function of new weapons/gear/etc.  Overall I'm very pleased at how this game turned out, I'm not sure if it's worth 50 bucks(I got it on sale), as it seems to have around 15 hours of singleplayer gameplay(though it does have multiplayer too), this is definitely a great buy, especially for any fans of the series.",

How was I surprised and delighted when I have to play this game.   Whole game is greatly built with solid level design. Story is not bad iether. After some time you know how the thing will unravel but it wont stop you or make it boring. Searching for artifacts, gps casches and better weapons make the gameplay longer but the game does not force you to this activities. Only thing that is not best are the controls. As todays standard this game was primary developed for consoles and sometimes you feel this (which occasionaly mean death). Its not frustating but little iritating.¨  Overall I realy like this game and have really good time playing it. So I recommend it to enyone who like 3rd person games. Even those who dont play any previous game of this franchise. Its wery solid and great fun. 8,5/10",

You gain EXP from enemy kills, optional tomb raids, hunting animals, etc. You then get a skill point every level to unlock or improve abilities.  Weapons can be upgraded with scrap collected to improve damage, accuracy or unlock an alt-fire ability.  The voice acting is good, the gameplay is good, the sound is good, and the graphics are great. Basically it's a good game.    The Bad    A few criticisms. The only weapons worth upgrading or using are your pistol and bow. The bow is silent, arrows can be retrieved, and it's alt-fire modes can be utilized to bypass tomb obstacles or storyline obstacles. The pistol is accurate, with a fast rate of fire and gets a silencer later in the game.  Because you are rewarded double EXP for head shots, and many of your gun fights will take place at a distant; neither the shotgun nor the assault rifle are accurate enough to get consistent head shots.  The cinematic aspects of the game are obnoxious. I don't need the camera angle to change as I wade through water and watch as Lara moves under a fallen iron beam. Or having debris fall as I'm climbing up a ladder or rock face. I'm literally holding up, feeling bored and you're dragging out this scene for no other reason then to make it feel like a movie or pad time.  Lara needs to shut her mouth when I'm doing puzzles. If it takes you longer than 2 mins to figure out a puzzle in a tomb, the game will remind you to 'activiate survival instinct' a ping type ability that highlights all interactive objects in your vicinity. If it takes you longer than that Lara will give you an audible hint like 'I need to do X somehow...'  From what I can tell you can't turn this 'feature' off.  If the player is too dumb to figure out the puzzles, then they're too dumb to figure them out. If they want to give up they can easily look up the answer online, but that should be the  PLAYER'S DECISION. I don't need a fu cking Navi over my shoulder spoiling the challenge for me.",

They've done fantastic work on her character - something which was lacking in previous games of the franchise (she's not just the arrogant, shallow Lady Croft she was in previous games) and you can actually SEE the progression of her character over the course of the game. She's every bit as fantastic as she was in previous games, but this time she's just a little more human.   One of my only problems with this, however, is how quickly her character changes between cutscenes and gameplay - in the cutscene she's horrified by her ordeal and how she actually had to (spoilers) kill someone, and almost as soon as you're thrown back into gameplay, you're taking out dozens of baddies. I understand that it's hard to express the development of a character in a game, but perhaps they could have worked a little harder on making it believable, or even a smoother transition?  Overall, a brilliant game with few flaws. Some have different experiences, but I play for both the game and the story, and as a Lara fan, I think it does quite well in fleshing out her character.",

The game does several things very well. The sense of progress you get from both skill- and item-based rewards, and the pacing of the story, its mysteries beginning to unfold as you explore the island, keep you on your seat for hours. The ambient sound and music are perfectly orchestrated and aligned with the impressive visual art style of the game.  EDIT: I came back to alter my review, because I have the feeling I have judged the game from the wrong point of view. Tomb Raider is a genre mix. It has first-person-shooter, stealth, melee, jump&amp;run, and interactive enviromnent puzzle elements. It does not excel in neither of those and my issues with the game basically result in problems I have with the game mechanics - specifically with the combat mechanics - rather than the product as a whole. When I perceive the combat in Tomb Raider as a storytelling technique, I can live with it as it is. Conflict in all its forms and shades is an itegral part of the whole story. The non-combat elements more than make up for it, however, resulting in an overall exciting gaming experience.  Things the next installment ought to do better: - Visibility is a problem. When enemies immediately know where you are after you shot one of them...with a bow....in the middle of the night...in a dark forest, then you know that visibility is not really part of the game mechanic. Enemy FOV also seems to vary from one scene to the other, ranging between 45 degrees to 210 degrees, resulting in spectacular silent-takedown fumbles. - Hard difficulty does not mean multiplying enemy hitpoints by 100. This just gives players a sense of powerlessness. Increase enemy numbers, frequency of special attack usage etc. instead. - Player insta-kills by adjacent enemy via QTE: just no. Just because I have engaged an enemy in melee, do not penalize me by instantly killing me for doing so. If I am reacting too slowly to an enemy attack animation, ok, then it is my fault. Killing me without any warning sign is just a dumb thing to do and very frustrating. I know this is not Chivalry nor Mount&amp;Blade, but please stop. - Harder and more frequent puzzles.",

As a long time fan of the series I probably expected the game to feel a little more like... you know, Tomb Raider.  Crystal Dynamics certainly has big plans for the franchise since this whole game is dedicated to Lara herself, rather than what all the other games are dedicated to, which is exploration and tombs. Their fixation on Lara is so strong they had to stick the whole family thing even into the remake of the first game, for god's sake. I didn't like that direction at all.   What bothers me is that this TR had the potential of having big interesting areas that weren't just shanty towns. There could've been way more exploring of the old Japanese palaces, rather than skipping through them in action sequences.   The overall cinematic feel is very Uncharted-like and seems very forced at times. QTEs are also present and I can't stand those. While they claimed there's gonna be so much exploring to do, there's really only two big areas in which some exploring can be done. The rest is pretty small or doesn't feel rewarding. I like the little history facts dropped here and there when picking up collectibles tho, that's what Lara should keep doing.   I just feel like the next game will be the one that really feels like a Tomb Raider. Unless they ONCE AGAIN decide that Lara's character should be the main focus, rather than her abilities and knowledge used in the field, along with exploration and mythology.",

It's a bit like Assassin's Creed platforming but with pressing buttons (and not too timing-obsessed either) instead of holding them down I suppose, which makes it feel slightly more natural.  Clambering around does go pretty well with cover-based shooting, and the enemies have a healthy supply of grenades to keep the combats bouncy.  Reading the journals and looking at the various priceless artifacts is fun, but the cutscenes make it seem like Lara didn't actually read the (optional) journals, so she seems a bit slow in the head when only figuring out the major plot points at the last possible moment rather than a few hours into the game. On a related note, it's very satisfying that the evil cult is founded on entirely accurate deductions, and not delusional at all.  The stealth sections are a bit pointless, as they're usually faster to beat if you take them head on, and most combats don't let you even try to start them sneakily despite stealth being pretty underpowered.",

It also has enough collectables to be fun, but not too many to be insanely time consuming. The game does have a schizophrenic attitude when it comes to Lara and being an empowered female main character though, she shows plenty of emotions through the game but she also ends up being victim to some of the most brutal death scenes I’ve seen in video gaming. This is a great game to get for any action adventure fan.",

Options tombs if you want addition challenge (I didn't care much for other tomb raider games so I skipped these.)  Cons: Kind of short Quick time events (I hate them so) To many close calls (This seems odd but you know movies that try to have non-stop action, but as a result you kind of get used to the constant danger and it loses effect. There were so many times in this game she just narrowly escapes that it kind of reminds you it's a game and breaks immersion. You climb burning buildings 3 or so times so it ends up becoming commonplace. Still doesn't take much away from the overall gameplay.)   Definitely a good game to buy.",

Lara, as usual, has a lot of awesome moves, including rock climbing with a climbing axe, scrambling up vertical surfaces, swinging from bars, that sort of thing.

Gameplay-wise it pulls its punches. Combat is braindead easy and Lara fights like a Delta team commando. Seriously, the mobs of enemies you face in this barely even slow you down, and I was playing on Hard. If you can get past the implausibility of that, it's cool watching her rip all opposition to pieces.  Not bothering with MP. There's better options out there and the combat isn't robust enough to justify any time spent there.  Picked it up for $12.00, and it was worth way more than that.

So you need to pay attention to the screen, but you'll come to know which actions do which and soon be able to guess which button to press without even looking at it. Still, in the beginning, it gets annoying.  The game also has collectibles throughout that give you bonus XP and stuff. You can easily max out before the end of the game. Each area can be revisited to get 100% completion in the game's collectibles.

            "review_text": " Summary review  A wonderful game that takes a character notoriously known for being oversexualized in past installments and turns her into a royal badass.   Detailed review  I heard a lot of great things about this game before buying this, and after trying it out on the PS3 at my father-in-law's apartment, I wanted to purchase this for myself.  I had somewhat of a rocky start with the game crashing every now and again (up to the 'saving a rescuer' mission), but that was only because I was trying to be stupid by using SweetFX with this game. I honestly found myself not needing that mod and the game stopped crashing altogether. Still don't know why that was a factor, and can only guess it was because it was forced to disable certain graphics options.  So fun fact for those getting crashes: If you're using SweetFX, try taking that off and see if that works. If not, I heard turning off tesselation also does the trick, but I haven't had that issue personally.  In any case, the story and gameplay are amazing.  The story, while predictable at some points, is enjoyable from beginning to end. It's amazing to see how someone so innocent that is freaking the hell out in every corner, transforms into a one-woman juggernaut. And it's not one of those types of games where they have one thing happen to them and they suddenly have Rambo powers, no.  This was a long process of enduring with having to fend yourself against a lot of things, both physically and emotionally.  I also give the voice actors and writers a solid A for convincing dialogues and interactivity. If there was a hiccup or two on dialogue, then I didn't notice it. And even enemy interaction was very entertaining. At the beginning, I sometimes forgot that I was supposed to shoot them only because I was expecting more dialogue and that got me killed, so huzzah for immersion.  Then there's the gameplay. Gameplay was super difficult at the beginning, only because everything was thrown into you at once. But that's most likely what the devs wanted to do. Throw everything at your face without knowing exactly everything on what to do, just like how Lara was thrown into everything the first time.  You'll be fumbling a bit yourself, and finding yourself saying 'Oh ♥♥♥♥!' to environmental changes, but as time goes on and as Lara starts adapting to everything around her, you too will find yourself adapting to the game mechanics, from figuring out how new weapons work, to becoming second nature the moment you get a new attachment.  My only downsides to this game is its replay value. Once you play the game from start to finish, you feel more than accomplished, so play at your desired difficulty setting and stick with it. I played on hardcore from beginning to end, and don't regret ever having started off easier and then working my way up to harder.  All in all, I give this game a 5/5, and would recommend this game to anyone who wants a good time.",

One second you are completely distraught about killing one person and the next you are a stone cold mass killer. It added more challenge to the game but it was a bit unnecessary and unrealistic. If I wanted to kill a bunch of people I would play Call of Duty or some game like that.

A bit disorienting at times.. -Near the end of the game you finally get your final upgrades of the weapons, so you don't have much time to mess around with them when they're at their best. -Tombs were shockingly straight forward and contained only one puzzle before reaching the reward.

For starters it's really well optimized for PC and runs great even on older machines. I could set the graphics to ultra (not ultimate) and get 40-60 fps even with my old GTX560. I really appreciate the extra work that has gone into the PC version.  The level design is great! With everyone and their mother going open world, it's kind of refreshing to see that the devs took a step back and made very interesting linear levels, most of which have multiple options to progress through. You can still travel anywhere on the island and there is fast travel in case you get lost while doing that.  The combat system is great too! You have 4 different weapons plus the option to go melee and each one feels unique.  Even when you fail the game feels rewarding because Lara dies in such gruesome ways that you can't avert your eyes. Also, every death felt justified to me; I immediately knew where my mistake was and was able to correct it in the subsequent attempt. Many games put you in really unfair situations where you die over and over again which leaves you frustrated; Tomb Raider is not like that.  Hands down the best game I played in quite a while. I totally recommend you play it too.",

Okay, so if you're wondering, this is a game somewhat similar to the last Thief game, in the sense that it has you collecting shinnies, sniping people around and doing a couple of parkour tricks with some gadgets. It has a more linear experience, and it's more focused towards fps than stealth tho (although it's also a viable way to play sometimes).  Cons:  - It's rather short, about 12 hours.  - There's so many miracolous escapes from crumbling/being shot/burning/falling apart locations that the suspension of disbelief gets stretched quite a bit.  - Nobody plays the multiplayer, so it's impossible to get half of the achievements.  - It's really easy unless you play with both difficulty and AI difficulty in hard, and even then it's not a game that would be remembered by it's difficulty.  - The optional tombs are a bit tacked in. But nothing horrid, and the puzzles are fine.  Pros:  - Stunning locations. I went around screencapping everything when I entered a new place.  - Surprisingly good combat system, both ranged and melee.  - Some replayability looking for the hidden collectibles, although as I said you won't be getting all the achievements anyway.  - Decent story. Could have been executed with a bit more finesse, but interesting.  - Interesting collectibles with their unique art and descriptions (just like in Thief), in addition to other, generic ones.  Overall: 8.5/10",

            "review_text": "The reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise that started in 1996, Tomb Raider (2013) is the modern day re imagining of Lara Croft and how 'a survivor is born.' Developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix, the game departs from its 3rd person action-platformer roots into more of a 3rd person shooter. While this change of genre may displease many of the series' older followers, it was good compromise to streamline the gameplay to introduce a new audience and allow the game to work in the next-gen, where very few AAA platformer games are successful.  Much like Christopher Nolan's Batman films, Tomb Raider takes a different approach to its preceding titles. Just like Batman Begins focused on a young and inexperienced Bruce Wayne, Tomb Raider focuses on the origins of a young and vulnerable Lara Croft, before she became one of gaming's most iconic heroine protagonists. After a violent storm shipwrecks Lara and her crew on the lost island Yamatai, Lara is forced to survive the islands hostile inhabitants and find a way to escape. The game holds no bars, indeed throughout the entire game, Lara is beaten, shot, thrown off cliffs. Not for the squeamish, many of the games failure states subject the player to see Lara ravaged by wolves, speared through the head 'Cannibal Holocaust' style, crushed to death by cave-ins, you name it. The darker and grittier gameplay works well in Tomb Raider, making the player care about what happens to Lara. Most of the focus of the game is building Lara's character, transforming her from vulnerable archaeologist at the beginning to the 'tomb raider' character she is known as.  The island of Yamatai is divided into several zones, which serve as the set pieces for the story. While the zones range from forests, beaches, abandoned World War II military camps and makeshift shantytowns, they all incorporate the same formula of base camps where you can spend skillpoints and upgrade weapons or fast-travel, collectables that tell serve to explore the islands mysterious history, journals that expand on the lore of the island and backstory of the games side-characters. Each of the zones are designed very well, each of them feeling different from one another. Scripted on-rails sequences are very enjoyable to play, even towards the end of the game, running from explosions and collapsing buildings never gets old. Combat remains fairly standard as a 3rd person shooter, albeit somewhat clunky at times due to the auto-cover system. The few puzzles there are, optional tombs that you can find, are fairly easy in difficulty, most of them easy enough to figure out for the average gamer just wanting to progress further in the story. Traversing the islands landscape is particularly enjoyable, the 3rd person platforming never feels frustrating to play. It should be said that Tomb Raider was programmed with a controller in mind, while mouse and keyboard is usable, moving the camera and controlling Lara often feels sluggish at times, not being able to get any precise movements with WASD or a mouse.  Special mention should be made for both the art-designers and graphics optimizer. Even on a fairly weak system, Tomb Raider still manages to look absolutely stunning, and runs extremely well. The audio is fairly well done, the weapons sound nice to shoot, and the ambient sounds, particularly at night add well to the islands atmosphere. The soundtrack however does feel fairly generic, with not many tracks standing out throughout the game, with the exception of Lara's theme.  Tomb Raider is not without its flaws. The most obvious is the ludonarrative dissonance between the story and the gameplay. Near the beginning, Lara kills a person for the very first time, shooting him through the head in self-defense. A cutscene immediately after shows her crying and horrified at what she had done. Yet two minutes later (yes I did check how long it took) a 3rd person shooter sequence plays out, with Lara killing two mooks with barely any trouble at all. While Lara's change of character development is well done throughout the course of the game, her development from a vulnerable young girl to John Rambo is done much too fast within the time frame. Tomb Raider would have perhaps benefited from less 3rd person cover shooter sequences and more stealth elements, where emphasis would have been on surviving and avoiding enemies rather than killing waves of generic mooks. Tomb Raider's lead writer Rhianna Pratchett admits this shortcoming in an interview with TotalBiscuit, citing the disconnect between game designers and story writers when it comes to making the game.  Another unnecessary addition was the absurd amount of collectibles to be found in the game. Having a few would have been alright, however Tomb Raider has well over 100 different collectibles to be found throughout. This vast amount to find disrupts the entire flow of the games story, and feels entirely out of place. Why is Lara collecting birds eggs? Why is she lighting statues? It feels all extremely obligatory, like the copy and pasting of the Ubisoft formula. The game would have been much stronger without them. With the exception of Lara herself, side-characters aren't as utilized as well as they could be, all of them feeling a little too cliche. There is the sassy black woman, the young geeky nerd, the wise and experienced mentor, the shifty middle aged man, the adventurous young girl, the crazy preaching bad guy. Their personalities are a little more expanded on in documents you can find throughout the game, but still they feel extremely 2 dimensional, especially compared to Lara herself. It feels like their sole purpose in the game is to act as plot devices for Lara to work with and overcome. I can forgive this a little more however, as Lara's character development is the primary focus of the story, and every character shapes her in some way by the end of the game.  Square Enix famously said that despite selling 3.4 million copies four weeks after Tomb Raider's release, the game was deemed as a 'commercial failure.' While it is sad to see game companies focusing on squeezing as much money out of their customers as possible instead of making a good game, Tomb Raider is undoubtedly a successful title, particularly for a reboot of an aged franchise. With solid mechanics, excellent graphics and an enjoyable story that re-imagines Lara Croft, Tomb Raider is well worth the play.",

Beautiful environments, class A art direction - as always, Tomb Raider games have been consistent with pushing the bar on graphics rendering and effects, and this installment is no exception to that rule. Great gameplay mechanics. Lara's character is more believable now than she ever was, from both the physical aspect - her physical proportions actually approach being realistic for the first time ever, she doesn't look like a blow-up doll for once - as well as her personality - no dry, witty, campy one-liners here. She's a whole different character at this point, and believe me, it's a very good thing.  I also like the more 'mature audience' approach being taken - these elements help to give the game and the characters and environments more believability when considering the desperate reality of their situation. To put it simply, this isn't your typical 'fun for the whole family' Tomb Raider game.  This game isn't afraid to get dirty, bloody, downright gory at times - I don't think I've ever really seen much (if any) bloodshed in earlier Tomb Raider games.  This game isn't afraid to have some strong language, never thought I'd hear someone drop an F-bomb in a Tomb Raider game. Not that strong language is a necessity, and by all means it's not overdone in the slightest in this game, it's not like characters are walking around sounding like drunken sailors. But again, it's a small touch that helps to add to the believability of the characters and the environment they're in. The voice acting is also top notch in just about every aspect.  This game isn't afraid to have a little good old-fashioned graphic violence, after all, it is kind of a 'survival' approach, even if it's not a true 'survival' game. But hey, if you were stranded on an island and constantly being besieged by survivors that have succumbed to barbarism, guess what? You'd do whatever it took to survive, and it probably wouldn't be pretty or sugar-coated in the slightest. Once again, immersion, immersion, immersion. Believability of the game world and its characters.  Crystal Dynamics has done a STELLAR job with the Tomb Raider franchise, they've done wonders to breathe new life into the series and Lara Croft - I've thoroughly enjoyed Legend, Anniversary, and Underworld. The engine they developed starting with Legend made playing Tomb Raider games fun again.  Get this game. You won't be disappointed, unless you're an undying fan of the old 'campy' Lara Croft. Believe me, I was for years, but this reboot has totally won me over, best so far, can't wait for Rise of the Tomb Raider to be released for PC.",

The action scenes with using weapons or stealth or traps from the enviroment like oil-barels and oil-lamps, is GREAT.  What I totaly DISPICE is the fighting sequences with wolves, which basically have no logic to them...press F or E at the exact moment that you are instructed , or you DIE... you can fight with any human vilain in many diffrent tactics (stealth, bow,guns) ,  but the with wolves it's F and E at the right moment or you reload....  Whoever designed the wolves-fight should be left on the same island and get eaten by them... settings on easy-explore each camp to 90% and have been losing to the same wolve straight 50 times...ENOUGH... just delete and never go there again...",

I would recommend playing with a controller.  I only have two negatives regarding this game. First, nobody could even come close to surviving what Lara does. Which pushes the bounderies of suspended belief much too far for me. Second, the difficulty. I would recommend anyone 13+ put the setting to Hard from the start. Even on Hard the game is not that difficult. Another, higher, difficulty setting would have been a wonderful addition.  I hope other developers take notice and we see more well-crafted female protagonists. Lara is strong and beautiful. A model of true femininity. Little boys may not like the new direction of Lara, but I sure as hell do.",

This Tomb Raider is a very casual game and the overall difficulty is rather low. This could possibly disappoint some hardcore players seeking a challenge, it didn't spoil my fun though (playing on normal difficulty).   The game has some sneaking but is by far no sneak game. It has some experience based leveling and some equipment upgrading but is by far no RPG. There's quite some shooting but it's not an FPS. It has some ridles, but they are rather easy and won't hurt your brain. Most of the time you will jump, crawl, moan, climb, shoot, burn, slide, run or fall through a really beautiful scenery and impressive levels. The rich setting of the game, taking place at a remote island with caves and tombs to discover and treasures to claim, is the true strength of the game.   The story won't win an oscar and levels and gameplay are pretty linear but the pace is well timed. The game is the opposite to 'harcdore' games like Dark Souls, because Tomb Raider is very forgiving and thus, very rewarding. Auto saves are often, you never loose gathered secrets, experience or loot. The controls are very forgiving in regards of the timings, even difficult jump passages can be mastered at the first try. This leads to fast progression in the game and joyful exploration, i never was frustrated or bored. Even with that steady progression i needed more than 20 hours for the playthrough, so there is plenty of content.   This is not a game for younger children because there are brutal death scences, most of the times of yourself ('What? I'm dead? Is that a pole coming out of my head?!').  Replayability is rather low, you can collect and see everything in the first playthrough. I skipped the multiyplayer part, so no opinion on that. But if you can grab Tomb Raider at a nice price it's definitively worth buying.",

I could only imagine playing this on a dedicated rig. The controls are fluid with a controller. (I have not tried using the mouse and keyboard, though I'd imagine itd be easier to shoot with) I'd give this a solid 8.5/10 A steal on sale and a must for any Tomb Raider fan. It also is a great way for the new generation of gamers to experience Lara Croft. I cant wait for the next one!",

But the reboot of Tomb Raider stood out for me. The characterization of Lara, the setting, the pacing, action, puzzles and the story all came together seamlessly to create a very good game.   The puzzles no longer feel like enormous out of place contraptions made by insane dwarves, but instead like believable obstacles in the way of Lara's path, and as such there's no jarring switch from puzzle mode to regular travel mode. Sometimes puzzles are just part of the action and you're not even thinking of them as puzzles.  I would like to see the survival aspect expanded on if there's another TR game in the future. It seemed good to need to hunt for food and to make a fire at the beginning of the game, but after that it wasn't ever necessary which didn't make a lot of sense.  Overall the game was up there with Max Payne 3 as both games did a really good job of constantly driving the game forward by perfectly blending really good voice acting, story, cut scenes, level design and overall game mechanics.

The ship crashes on the island which is populated by crazy survivors who want the entire crew dead. So it's up to you to find a way of the island.   To begin this review I want to express something about this game. When it was first announced, I wasn't a major fan of the gritty and violent tone of the game. I felt that taking it too far",

The only issue I have is remembering which button goes with which icon, but that's just me and my bad icon memory. It looks awesome on PC as well, I was thinking of getting it for console, then got this on sale. I think button mashing is better than stick wiggling too. I figured that Square Enix would do great, they made other great games, (Kingdom Hearts being the only other one I've played) and before anyone says anything, the other group that worked on this did a great job too. I like the idea of stealth, with a survival atmosphere, it makes ammunition for weapons so much more important and every shot counts. When I first started playing, I kept forgetting you could move while aiming ( recently played Resident Evil 4, ps2 version, don't recommend that version) so I surprised myself by pressing S, to back up, I felt dumb. Anyways, if you're looking to try Tomb Raider, try this one, it is just called that because it's related to the other games I think, then if you're in to it, try some of the others, just don't judge their quality of gameplay based off of this one :)  If someone says another game is worse than this and its older than this one, they either are telling the truth or they played them backwards (by release date).",

Pros: 1. Good gaming illusion with a moving story and a new fascinating Lara. 2. The introduce of bow and arrow is reall wonderful.

You genuinely felt like you were Laura and you would stop at nothing to rescue Sam, and you felt the intensity of every axe swing on a cliff that meant life or death. All of this wonderful work is tied in a nice bow that is the story line. While exploring the tombs is not necessary to understand the game, it brings so much into view about the sun queen and why everything is happening. Even if you didn't do any of these side quests, the game has such a rich plot you'll feel like you just exited the movie theatre after watching Braveheart for the first time when you finish this game. Overall, while I don't think the graphics will age very will, the gameplay and story will impress people for years to come. 9/10",

There is a decent melee system too which adds another dimension. It took me 24 hours of gameplay to finish the game and I only had a 84% completion since there were areas I didnt get to.

The graphics are great (for when they came out) and help add to the atmosphere. Water effects and particles are all detailed and clear giving a real sense of weight to the environments.   Gunplay is decent, not fantastic, but good enough to cary the game.

The situation (trapped on an island controlled by a madman and his goons) and combat (weapons/mechanics/strategy) are very similar to Far Cry, while the climbing and the actual tomb raiding reminded me a lot of the Ezio-era Assassin's Creed games.

Every time you failed, you need to load the last checkpoint, forced to waste a time by watching boring and long cut scenes.  Puzzles are more platfrom action oriented than RoTTR so you will fail to solve puzzles even if you know exactly what you should do. Every time you failed, you need to intereact a few things in the narrow timing and do boring platform which also requires narrow timings to waste more time.  Combat is pathetic. Mostly it's too easy. My deathes were because of enemies appearing from thin air. Surely, I can't prepared for that in the first run!  There was one cut scene where you have to fly through the trees by parachute while avoiding trees. I died a few dozen times because of the hitbox of the tree is larger than it appears to be!

Overall its a nice game with a nice story, but nothing too ground breaking though and the multiplayer isn't too great. If you plan on play it, do it for the story on sale.",

            "review_text": "I bought this game a few years ago, never expected to be so good, this game is action-packed, a leap-of-faith simulator, mountain climbing 101 guide, archery simulator 2013 etc. The main story of the game: Lara and her crew get stranded on an island in the Dragon Triangle after their ship was caught in the middle of a storm. Lara gets separated from the crew and she needs to find a way to get back to them. Soon after you get your bow, the first weapon out of 4, this is my favorite weapon just for the fact that you can be a silent assassin and has the most uses. You get fire arrows, rope arrows, penetration arrows, etc. After you manage to find a part of the crew, a man by the name of Mathias (  The bad guy which you need to kill  ) comes and gives you help, only to find yourself in a wolf trap and surrounded by a pack of wolves, luckily you still have your bow and get rid of them. After some time walking in the forest you find russian mercenaries which capture the crew and you. And so you set on to kill every single Russian and rescue your crew. However you can sidetrack and acquire documents, relics and gps-caches that will help you understand whats happening on the island and for that juicy 100% completion rate.   The controls are smooth, but I don't recommend playing this game with a controller, because you will have to do a lot of shooting and dodging, this is where the mouse shines and the music really kicks you into the atmosphere of the game.  Dont expect this game to be easy, sometimes the enemies are on steroids and aim-bot the ♥♥♥♥ out of you, I can't number the amount of times I died just because I was hiding behind a wall and the enemies still managed to hit my head. The game becomes more difficult the more you progress, to a point in which the enemies are armored as hell and you need to dodge, stun, shoot and repeat that until the enemy dies. Not only it's hard but sometimes you are swarned by enemies and can't even dodge because they are shooting you.   Overall, Tomb Raider is a game worth the money and time, the story is fascinating, the game is difficult and it's good for those who want a good challenge and for those who want 100%.",

A point where Tomb Raider loses to the mentioned Uncharted series are the secondary characters they aren't near as likeable as in the latter, and mostly worse written the only character you actually get to like is the one that's given sufficient screen time Conrad Roth. I actually felt sorry for the old warrior. The game's overall tone is gritty and dark, and that's what makes the plot quite inconsistent with the gameplay Lara whines and moans a lot (damn frequently the game actually sounds like a porno), cries over her dead comrades and after making her first kill in the cutscenes, but then the gameplay leads you to brutally murder dozens of random people. The gameplay itself is fun, killing (especially with the bow) feel satisfying, puzzles are short but well-made and actually require you to think and action setpieces are gripping. The campaign is structured as Batman: Arkham Asylum, so it isn't exactly open-world, but you may revisit the deserted locations to finish collecting stuff only you won't really want to do it after the main storyline. As for multiplayer, it's quite bland, a poor version of Uncharted's. To sum up, Tomb Raider is not exactly a gem, it doesn't bring anything new to the genre but it was one helluva ride!",

It doesn't have an atmosphere of being one on one in ancient tombs where you have to figure out puzzles. It packed with constant action and gunfights without compinsating it with enough platforming or puzzle solving.  We had this original 3D planformer (something that almost no one ever nailed before). Then came Uncharted, took a lot of inspiration from Tomb Raider and created itself as another game series. Then Tomb Rider forgot what it suppose to be good at and tried to simply copy its rival - the Uncharted while losing all of its originality that made it into amazing game to begin with. That irony could of not be any heavier. A franchise that drestroyed itself as an original title while trying to mimic its rival that actually took an inspiration from it.  If you want a TRUE Tomb Rider experience - Try out the Anniversary. If you want something slightly more action-packed - try the Uncharted series. Because this game is just one huge mistake. A step in a completely wrong direction for this rebooted franchise.",

Posting this in 2016 - 3 years on from release - my criteria for nominating any 3D stereoscopic capable game is - near perfect implementation with almost no visual errors and jaw-dropping three dimensional immersion - which this game achieves. Another title that could tie with this is Max Payne 3 - another 3D vision compatible title.  As i have just upgraded to a 27 inch BenQ 3D vision monitor and playing on a GTX 1070 - the experience is sublime - and it saddens me the ship has sailed for this rather immersive technology (when done right) in favor of virtual reality - whose compromises i could not overlook and for me, could not quite not surpass 3D stereoscopic gaming for now.",

            "review_text": "This was my first Tomb Raider game and I gotta say the developers have won a new fan of the series, the tldr for this review is that you should 100% play the game because it's a blast.  The game is set on a mythical Japanese island called Yamatai, the island has been a graveyard for many ships and planes that have been brought down or wrecked by mysterious storms that plague the area. The design of the different areas of the island are fantastic, every area from forests, beaches, old military bunkers, makeshift towns set up by a cult made up of shipwreck survivors and many more all get a great balance between feeling fresh and individual, but also that they are part of one island. This high level of design is maintained through the largest areas like the Shantytown and Beach, to the smaller through parts like mountainous passes and a radio tower you have to scale. I find this very pleasing to play through, as the team could easily have not put the love and detail into areas of the game you spend small amounts of time in but to see the quality throughout is commendable. The design level remains excellent in the side quests and collectibles, the Tombs were possibly my highlight of the game with many of them making me go 'wow' as they revealed themselves in full, after having to crawl through a tiny crack or hole in a cave, seeing a big beautifully crafted underground Tomb is very cool. They each have a puzzle in them to solve, none are very hard and will at most make you think for 2-3 minutes but as the game is being sold as a big AAA game to a large audience, I don't blame the developers for keeping the puzzles fairly easy. The relics and documents you collect are all interesting and nicely made, they give you nice insights into the islands history and culture, as well as few journals from present day island inhabitants. The best compliment I can pay for these is that I wanted to collect them and did so on my first play through, there is nothing worse than tedious collectables you do t care about and these are as far from that as you can be.   The game begins with Lara and her crew of the ship Endurance trying to locate the aforementioned island of Yamatai to explore its mythical history and the ancient empire ruled by Sun Queen Himiko, the ship is wrecked in a storm and the crew split up, your initial goal is to meetup with your crew and regroup, but thanks to a cult of insane bloodthirsty sun worshippers led by the craziest, most bloodthirsty sun worshipper you could wish to meet quickly make your task far harder. Without revealing too much she ends up delving deeper into the island to reveal its mysteries, and discoveres much more than she imagined. The plot and story is a very effective as an introduction to Lara as the badass woman we know her as for both new players to the series and returning players, the focus is very strongly on Lara and as a result the side cast of island cultists and the Endurance crew are fairly boring and uninteresting but I'm not too fussed about this as the game is about Lara and her beginning and it does a very good job of it.   Gameplay revolves around 4 weapons that you can modify and improve through the game by finding weapon parts and salvage in boxes around the island, animals that you can hunt, and the bodies of enemies. The pistol and assault rifle are pretty standard 3rd person shooter fare and I used both a reasonable amount, the shotgun I found fairly useless apart from blowing up wooden doors that can only be destroyed with said gun, however the star weapon is easily the bow, you start off with a makeshift bow and by the end you have an absolutely amazing competition weapon, with armour piercing, napalm and grenade arrow upgrades. The only down side to the bow is takes a little time to pull back the arrow and release so in an intense firefight you'll probably fall back to the assault rifle where you can quickly hop out of cover and send off a few bullets. You can also upgrade perks in Survivor, Hunter and Brawler categories, early perks are standard, slightly boring stuff like reduced damage taken, extra ammo space etc but by the end there are some decent T3 perks like Cartographer which shows all Tomb and treasure map locations, and instant kill dodges. I do have a bone to pick here though, 4 of the hunter perks unlock execution style finishers for each weapon that earns you bonus XP. In my opinion this does not in any way fit in with Lara's personality, she is in not a killer or muderer for the sake of it and these perks are so against her as a person I can't help but feel they do not fit in. I would also have liked to have seen a greater emphasis on stealth in the game rather than just shooting your way through the whole thing. Other than these I had a lot of fun with the game, flying along zip lines, doing all the mini challenges scattered around the map and exploring the island.  Scores: Design, 10/10. Plot, 9/10, gameplay, 7/10, for an overall score of 26/30.  I had a lot of fun with the game, it's one of the best designed and most interesting I've played in a while and I cannot wait to get my teeth into what I'm sure will be the next blockbuster series (Rise of the tomb raider is downloading as I type), I hope to see a bit more versatility in the gameplay though, I'd hate for it to become a stale shoot em up.",

            "review_text": "Why write a review for a three+ year old game? I don't know, maybe I'm disgruntled, or disappointed, dismayed maybe?  Tomb Raider was due for a reboot, and it hit during a gaming trend that put it in league with series like Uncharted, Far Cry, and Just Cause. A main character in an 'isolated' region driven to advance, explore, and discover while picking up an array of new gear during the progression of a mostly linear path set inside some otherwise semi-open maps. These games end up being part RPG, part Tell-Tale, and part semi-splash-illusion of sandbox concept. What's very clear in this particular Tomb Raider is that it's intended to bring new people in and give them a stepping stone to Lara Croft's adventures without creating a complex or convoluted experience to deter them.  Experienced FPS/RPG gamers are going to find this game (as like many in its genre/style) a cake walk, and that is one area that was a big sore-spot for me.   Lara is supposed to be somewhat experienced/and/or/developing in her tomb raiding skills for this go-round, yet an expeerienced FPS player can go through and perform flawless headshots and walk her through unscathed and it really breaks the emersion of the story. That's not the game's fault (admittedly), but for her to say 'I'm can't do this, I don't have the skills' and then walk out five minutes later of a crazy scenario going 'Wow, I barely made it,' when the player exerted little effort? I know, first-world gaming problems. Plus, there is a game setting of 'Hard' that, to my regret, does not come with achievement for having completed the game at. The achievement is at least 25% of the reason I'll select the difficult option alongside what (I hope) will be improved tactical/AI response of the in-game enemies. Sadly, with this game, 'Hard' just gives the bad guys more HP, and when any enemy takes 15-20 bullets out of an SMG to hit the dirt? That's just bad form. I would say 'Oh, just headshots all around, ja?' But no, more of the end-game targets start wearing helmets, masks, or shields that require a double or triple tap (or other acrobatics) to eliminate them.  Speaking of eliminating bad guys, there sure are an awful lot of them in this game. Like, a lot. A lot a lot. A decent bulk of my upgrading salvage came from stuff I stripped off guys I killed. I really think there could have been better planning in placement, function, and abilities to make less enemies a more realistic and imposing threat without feeling the need to flood the game with bodies.  Speaking of bodies. There is a lot of gore, dismemberment, and general 'disgusting' in this game. Rivers of blood, mountains of body parts? This is supposed to be an un-traversed-to, generally avoided, and rarely incursioned island. How have there possibly been that many people killed so recently?! There was a clear line of definition between 'old and dusty' dead bodies and 'fresh from the farm' bodies. And the ratio of dusty to fresh was easily 1 to 200. And I wish that was just an exagerrated joke, but I don't think it counts out that way.  There are other reasons about the ending, too, that I am very 'eh' about, but wont spoil. I'd really like a neutral review option for games. I'm not saying I don't recommend this game, but I'm also not saying I'm not not recommending it either. You follow me?  It's not a bad game, but definitely don't play it back-to-back with Far Cry 3, it'll discomfort your sense of game-reality.",
