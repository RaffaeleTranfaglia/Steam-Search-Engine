Every enemy clips through walls and the ground (granted, they are ghosts but it looks stupid) The attack combos are nothing special and you'll end up just mashing the number buttons randomly because none of it really matters. Honestly I got this game out of curiosity and that has been quenched after about 8 minutes of gameplay. Good luck!",
