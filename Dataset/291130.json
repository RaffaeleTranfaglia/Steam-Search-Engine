            "review_text": "This is a pretty decent 2D sidescroller. Many of the reviews I see here are pretty negative about this game. I myself have a hard time to see something bad with this game.   Its your standard generic story about somebody trying to save somebody they love from sudden generic badguys. We can call it 'the Mario concept' exept that instead of being some dude trying to save a girl you are instead a ninja girl called Akane and you need to save some dude she loves. Each level is filled with enemy ninjas and dogs that are trying to stop Akane from reaching her loved one. There are also alot of cool bosses that you need to beat. They all got different patters that you need to learn and are over all unique and fun in their own way. The levels offer a great variety and keeps you wanting to know whats coming next.  Akane can throw kunai's and walljump pretty easy. She also got 3 jutsus that she can use and they are all different. One throws alot of kunai's in one direction and the second one makes alot of kunai's rain down nearby and my personal favorite is the one that shoots kunai's in all directions at the same time.  The music is really great and atmospheric and has a good variety.  Other then that the game is kinda hard at times and can be really challenging at certain moment. You pretty much need to be ready for the challenge this game gives you. Do not get fooled by the first 2 levels. It gets harder then that.  I give this a 10/10. Feels alot like an old game that you would play on your 8-bit but at the same time if feels really fresh.",

Basically felt like I would be actively wasting my time playing this after beating a few levels.  Sorry Akane, too many good games to play to spend time on the subpar efforts you put out.",

            "review_text": "Imagine a game where you play as a ninja. What kinds of things do you do? Do you leap nimbly from rooftop to rooftop, strike silently from the shadows, and vanish in the blink of an eye? Or do you plod around slowly, bump into pacing bandits, and collect ugly kimonos? Because if the latter sounds good to you, boy do I have a game you'll love.  The game opens with a bunch of tiny women in kimonos and Akane swooning over some dude who gets whisked away by some witch lady. I guess you're trying to get him back by platforming through 15 levels, and impress him by finding three of the same ugly kimono in each level. That's pretty much all the direction you're going to get, and the kimono thing is optional. Along the way you'll have to throw tons of knives (your only attack) at tons of bandits, monks, and dogs. You can find power-ups for your knives, health, and magic (lots more knives) by breaking lucky cats scattered willy-nilly like bricks in Super Mario Bros.  Levels are bog-standard fields, forests, and castles, with one background and one floor texture apiece. Akane really looks like a game made using an open-source tileset, with enemies tweaked to be more ninja-y and Akane to be more top-heavy. Every third stage has a boss that attacks in such challenging patterns as 'drops things from ceiling' and 'jump over when he charges'. Everything in the game moves with the same sticky jumps and molasses slowness so there's not much challenge other than the threat of dozing off. I wish I could tell you how Akane's tale ends but I could only take about thirty minutes of zero-effort level design and boilerplate platforming. Actually I lied, I don't care how the story ends, either.",

            "review_text": "Ready to go back to 8bit gaming? This game does it all for nostalgia. From the graphics, to the terrible platforming controls. Playing as the clumsiest Ninja, you must defeat Hiromi for some reason. It seems a man fell in love with this woman, now you must go kill her. The story doesnt matter, did it ever in old games? Get ready to slip and slide on ice skates as you trip over your own shoelaces to get to the final boss, murdering the woman that man fell in love with, HA, that will teach him a lesson! Bosses are easy once you figure out their patterns, and you will die more from the controls than ever actually playing the game. Ahhh, just like the old days, this is a great lazy evening game, since it can be beaten in one playthrough. The game is real real short, I hope they make some DLC because its a fun game!!!  Rating: 8/10 Value: $4.99",

It's a pretty decent nod to the 16bit era of action-platformers on the Sega Genesis and Super Nintendo, and since it's a pretty short game, it doesn't overstays its welcome and gives you enough content for the price asked.  Give it a try, just don't play it expecting a AAA title for 3$.",

            "review_text": "An interesting retro platformer adventure? I liked the leveldesign as it's quite beautiful and fits with the theme, feudal Japan. And that's about it.  The controls are wobbly at best, the walljumping is terrible and enemies can corner  you pretty quickly if you don't anticipate it. I feel like this was one of those games where they came up with the character first before writing the story. From my view the story is not all that well thought out and mind you, really clich√©.  A warrior, or samurai is admired (and or loved) by a lot of girls, the protagonist being one of them. Some evil guy pops up and steals said samurai. Hmm.. where have I heard that plotline before? Oh right, in every Super Mario game ever. They only reversed the genders. I don't know what it is with that 'female protagonist' trend.. I like games with female protagonists in general, so I usually buy them and give them a shot. This time, however, I was disappointed. Also that's about all you get for a plot line. No additional thoughts, just genderswapped Mario.  I have not researched the game's creators, but I reckon this is some kind of university project by one or two people. It's not a bad start, but there's a lot waiting to be fixed, for example the controls and general responsiveness of the game.  All in all I'd say it's more or less well thought out, but kinda got cut short during production. There's definitely some potential there, however I don't see a reason to buy something that reminds me of Mario and Megaman, however is just inferior in quality. I'd have to say this game earns about a 6/10.",
