            "review_text": "I like the game, but it's not what I was expecting. This is more of a puzzle game than I anticipated, the maps are mazes to coordinate through and the goons perform a fairly simple function. I think the game is very cool, and fun if you enjoy the puzzle, and buy into the dynamic of the heists... but if you're looking for a heist planning sim, this is not it.",

            "review_text": "Imagine taking GTA5, Payday 2, Battlefield: Hardline, Doorkickers, and Frozen Synapse, and throw them into a bowl and mix them all together, then put them in the oven at 350 degrees for about 20 minutes.  The result would be some nasty stuff nobody would ever want, but at least it would give you good reason to not bake ever again and play The Masterplan instead.  I've watched and played this game since they jumped into Early Access last year and enjoyed every minute of it. I suppose that micro-managing a robbery/heist wouldn't sound too exciting, but the very first time you walk out with that cash in hand (and no cops giving you a hard time), it gets you hooked.  There are many different ways to complete each heist, but eventually it all boils down to busting through the front door with SMG's, Shotguns, and Rifles, and mowing down everyone, greatly hoping that you make it out with at least half the loot. OR, you could go the stealthy methodical route with silenced pistols and tranquilizer guns, taking down cameras and stuffing people into rooms. Each heist has their own way of making you think, with their own way of rewarding you by doing things by the book. Some heists you absolutely have to go in armed to the teeth, and some will brutally punish you for not sneaking your way in.  The Soundtrack is simple and somewhat dynamic, but still does its job good. Makes the setting feel like a real 70's action flick. Sadly, neither Austin Powers nor Foxxy Cleopatra make a cameo in-game.  5/5 Stars 11/10 Would heist a kiosk again $50 out of $100,000 loot taken, with a 75% evidence cleaning fee.",

            "review_text": "The bad. I'm gonna start this review with the negatives. The Masterplan is a game I really truly wanted to love. But… I just can’t… First off the game feels too half-baked for a game supposedly out of early access. Examples, why are there two lockpicks you can find on one level but no more anywhere else? Why can I not view my goons stats after I hire them? Why can't I buy a bigger car? Why after the final score is the only way of exiting back to the normal game to quit to the main menu? It in turn doesn’t save the game from that score so you can technically never fully finish the game. You will still get achieves for it however. And why oh why does the game crash so much? 30 out of my 50 hours spent on this game have been afk for the last 3 nights trying to get the, “It’s my dayjob” achievement seeing how it’s the last one I need to get only to find in the morning that the game had crashed when it didn’t even have to do anything other than just sit there. Finally, I am running windows 8.1 and have a GeForce GTX 750 Ti 2gb version and yet in full screen mode I only get 30 fps where in Battlefield 4 I get 80 fps that can drop to 40 when intense events are happening. That should not be the case at all for a top down game with such basic graphics.  The good. This game did provide me with some 20 hours of entertainment and I ended up beating the whole game. In this time there were some pretty fun moments. For example, when I used explosives to blitzkrieg the bank and later perfected my technique to blitzkrieg the casino. It is also pretty satisfying to go through all the work to clear a level and make off with the loot walking through the stealthy (or loud) chaos you’re leaving behind. Some other fun moments consisted of, holding up around 15 guards with 2 goons while my other 2 rounded up everyone else on the level, having a level without cops or cleaner costs where I basically stormed in with Uzis and murdered everyone, making off with the 4mil from the final score. Despite not being able to keep it was still fun. These are some examples of the good times you can have while playing this game.  Pros and Cons  Pros: Fun top down gameplay. Ability to hire and make a full sized crew. Satisfaction of perfecting a plan all the way through (as long as it doesn’t crash!) The ability to carry out a plan in such different ways really makes you wonder how you can approach each level. Pretty original idea.  Cons: Frequent crashes. Low fps regardless of good graphics card. Half-baked unfinished features. (example lockpicks) Loud not a very practical option as you can lose up to 96% of your payout from cleaner costs alone. Can’t view goon stats after hiring! The game will never technically acknowledge you completed the final score outside of an achievement, but everything else for that score resets.  TL:DR/Summary All in all this game is pretty fun at first providing a new and original idea. However, this game was yanked out of early access way to soon with too many unfinished features, and crashes to make it worth its $20 price tag.  Recommended? No ",

            "review_text": "It was really enjoyable while it lasted. At first I hated this game, I didn't know what i was doing so I was really confused, but after taking my time the game became enjoyable for a little bit. This game is basically a maze/puzzle game with a heist makeover. The gameplay is really enjoyable at first but my oh my does it get repetitive, you literally do the same thing over and over again. Avoid these guards, avoid these cameras, find the color coded keys to unlock specific doors; it just gets really boring after a while. But like I said before the game is good for a little bit. You will just get into the groove of the game when you encounter what alot of other people are saying, which is constant crashing. At first I didn't want to believe them becasue up until 4.8 hours the game was running flawlessly, but then that damn error popped up IN THE MIDDLE OF A HEIST. Yeah i said it smack dab in the middle and there is no save points, so if you were finished with a heist and just about to run to your car and you encounter a crash you have to start that whole heist over. So before you criticize my hours on this game take that into consideration. Before my 4.8 hour mark no crashes, after that though so basically between 4.8 and 6 hours i have encountered 3 yes 3 crashes. I was really wanting to go a little further you know just in case something good comes up, but after that third crash i had it with this game. So like I said I had a good time with this game when it was running. But do I recommend this, sadly no and the reason is soley on the repetitive gameplay and constant crashes.",

            "review_text": "The concept of this game felt wonderful and had MAJOR potential, (A mix between Monaco and Payday seemed like an ineresting concept) where the game falls is it's controls which are a LOT more confusing than you think, along with its constant crashing  The game requires you to click every time when you want to equip something and to interact with EVERY character around the environments, including yourself, this might sound easy at first, but when you pull out an item or drop something you need when a simple hotkey to activate things could've been used, it gets tedious.  You have to left-click yourself to 'activate' yourself, and right click to interact with things, and thats every part of interaction (i.e. right click on someone to aim and right click on them again to shoot, this might not seem like much, but when you aim at someone and when you need to quickly get rid of some people, the fast reactions needed for the game can easily be ruined if you accidentally move or shoot an object while people call police or beat you down, a better approach should've been moving and an attack/fire button   Then there's the awful camera, you constantly need to use WASD to move the camera itself, and this sounds like a minor gripe, but that (in my opinion) is lazy on the developers of the game because most top-down games that are styalized this way either show the whole map on the screen, or show arrows to where you need to go or the camera moves along with your movement  This game was a waste of time and it's disappointing that such an interesting concept and a game I looked foreward to messing around with ended up being poorly made, if anything, I only paid 5 bucks for the game and soundtrack, hopefully the sondtracks at least ok ",
