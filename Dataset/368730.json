            "review_text": "  (play time is inaccurate, due to offline mode)  No TIme To Explain is a 2D action platformer where you have a laser that can be used to damage enemies, and has enough recoil to act as a makeshift jetpack. You use that recoil to jump and fly your way past increasingly dangerous obstacles to get to the end goal on each level. The game spices things up by giving you other characters that each have their own way of getting around, but that's most of the game.  The story is simple and manages to be humorous the whole time. As you go on it becomes an increasingly silly tale of aliens, alternate realities, and time-traveling evil twins.  Is it worth it? Maybe not for 16 CAD, unless you  REALLY  like platformers. But on sale this charming title is definitely worth picking up.",

The whole level if you want, just imagine fighting a Crab and dancing at the same time, incredible, isn't it? 5- TELL MY WIFE THAT *boom* *boing* *fart* AUUUGHHHHH *fart again*  6- It has cooperative mode, DANCE PARTY! 7- Workshop levels, most of them are sh*tty but who cares :3 8- Did I say that I got it for free? Buying Speedrunners wasn't a mistake after all, I just saved 15$  Still I don't think the game is worth 15$, maybe if you add an online it would be better, but I like the game as it's at the moment. Also, I'm in love with the soundtrack &lt;3   DANCE!   oh yeh  9- Of course it has hats, my favourite one is the giant fox head, :3",

I would definitely recommend the game on sale, as 15 dollars for the amount of content available is asking a bit much.  I personally received this game for free because I previously owned Speedrunners, so I decided to try it out. To my surprise, the mechanics were enjoyable and not too frustrating. The game offered many great ideas and variants that transformed upon various platformer mechanics. At times I felt the controls were a bit irritating but for the most part I had no issues.   This isn't an amazing platformer like Super Meat Boy, but it is definitely worth a play, especially if you already received it for free like me.",

They will test your skills and you will become better while beating the game, beating it a second time is not as hard as the first time. Each grand section introduces some kind of new mechanic which keeps a refreshing pace of changes when a new section starts. Some parodies of games are in there as well, you will spot them when they are there.  It is a nice filler if you just want to play something oldschool with some weird physics and a gun which is more used like some kind of jetpack. The soundtrack is well made, you feel remindet to many other games which already are out there as well. Yes, Top Gear from the SNES will come back into your ears as well…  Oh and the hats… I still did not collect all of them, I am missing 4 of them…  GET THIS GAME! You will definitly not regret it.",

The controls and physics are way worse, and turn fun puzzle solving into levels where you are just fighting the controls.

Extremely restrictive mouse movement, with insane inverse mouse acceleration makes me question if they even tested the game before they released it.

            "review_text": "(Played with Keyboard and Mouse) Okay so i took my time to 100% the game(so my playtime might give you a clue about how much time it takes to complete the game), cause its not a very long game and the playtime in general is alright i guess.  The story is silly and fun with some quite simple platformer puzzles.  Graphics and sound are alright i guess, nothing special really but i enjoyed it. Levels are short so you dont have to spend too much time in them and its allways obvious what you have to do (go from the start to a fancy portal. pretty simple.) There are also some nice ideas of how you can get thru a 2d world with different movement types.  This is the point where i have to talk about why i wouldnt recommend it though: while there are several nice ideas of movement, the way it handles is just insanely frustrating. the 'normal' way (big laser that you basicly see everywhere getting used) seems like it has some mouse smoothing or something which wasnt too bad but a bit annoying. The main reason i have to talk bad about movement is cause of the ways you have to move in later levels, it feels horrible. while your character moves towards your mouse for example you can move your mouse around, so you can move the character while in the air with a new movement command, BUT you cant see where you move your mouse while your character is still moving towards your old mouse location actually go up and not drop down, making it very annoying to make precise quick movements like going up and then a sharp right turn or something cause you have no idea where your mouse exactly is. Also it seems buggy meaning that the movement suddenly stopped a few times, spikes kill you and dont spawn you where you should spawn and the boost in the air you get from shooting below you sometimes didnt really work the way it should either (big boost when on the ground - small boost while in the air when you jumped before you shoot) Setting wise ... there is nothing really. You cant change controls, you cant change resolution. atleast you could change the audio volume and mouse sensitivity. All in all its a fun idea but bad execution. I got it for free so i dont regret giving it a few hours but i cant recommend buying it.",
