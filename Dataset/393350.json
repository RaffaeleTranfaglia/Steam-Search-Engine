            "review_text": "'Um......' that was the first thing I said after playing this game. It is really rather strange. The art is kinda cool and the music is sorta neat. But there are no instructions, guide lines or goals at all. I know thats really part of the point of the game, but there really isn't much to do in the game and it doesn't capture my attention at all. It's almost like they tried to do what Proteus did and make a kind of anti-game where there are no goals, no objectives, no story, no instructions, and nothing to do but look and listen. Proteus got away with this because there was a sence of wonder and mystery. It made you want to go explore and see the world. In this I couldn't find that element of wonder so I lost intrest very quickly. I'm not sure the game is worth $4.99 so I can't recomend it.  EDIT I liked the game but I didn't like it enough to justify the 5 bucks. (I'm keeping the original post unedited for posterity and laughs; you don't have to read it.)",
