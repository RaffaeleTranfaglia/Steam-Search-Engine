            "review_text": "Demigod is a DOTA-like game that while providing a generally pleasing take on the genre fails to provide a complete experience and a number of game breaking issues means that most players will never truly enjoy it.  Demigod is a mix of strategy and role playing action, you pick from a list of demigods, either strong damage dealing assassins or minion summoning generals each with a unique set of skills and then do battle on a large arena as a team against another team of either human or AI controlled deities. As you kill enemies and do battle you earn currency and experience allowing you to level your demigod up through a branching skill-tree as well as purchase a variety of upgrades at your homebase, anything from stat boosting wearables to potions and massive faction boosts are available. At the end of a match all is reset and you get to do it all over again against a new foe or controlling a new hero.  Demigod makes a number of rookie mistakes however. The lack of any sort of tutorial makes the game difficult to learn and the single-player matches against the AI does in no way prepare you for the multi-player. As a heavily team dependent game it is quite possible for a single inexperienced player to lose the match regardless of his teammates leading to a generally hostile community.  The greatest mistake Demigod makes however, is in the multi-player. Connection issues plague every matchup and it requires an enormous amount of patience to play a full game. For a game that is so heavily multi-player based this should be a complete deal breaker for any potential buyers.  The game is fairly good looking and the sound and music is pleasant enough creating an enjoyable atmosphere.  All in all Demigod is a decent MOBA that provides you with a unique set of Generals and Assassins to control and has all the makings of an enjoyable game. The lack of single-player components and the massive connection issues makes me unable to recommend this to anyone however as even the most avid MOBA aficionado will be hard pressed to enjoy a game he cannot play.",

This is like a slower, but more strategy demanding game than more modern MOBA titles. You basically have to maintain control over certain points of interest to win the game.   Haven't played singleplayer modes.   POSITIVE: - Beautiful Design of characters and maps.  - Versatile gameplay styles depending on the map and Demigod you have chosen to play.  - Its a ton of fun for playing between friends.   NEGATIVE:  - Lack of online community.  - No tutorial.  - The Game crashed the first time I ran it on W10. But after a simple restart, the game functioned normally. I would expect more of these errors occur, but nothing too serious.   Note: Multiplayer skirmish games can last over an hour.   I recommend buying this game with a bunch of friends.",

However, when I grew up and remembered this game, I quickly realized that this game was definitely not the ♥♥♥♥. It just lacks in variety, and the combat feels clunky and slow-paced. It's not a bad game and it's fun to play, but it's not doto or lol. However, I lost a lot of respect for the devs of Demigod when I learned about their attitude in some media they published, idr if it was an interview or what. But basically, the devs were like 'we're going to beat those guys at league of legends, our game is better, it has more potential', and then when they failed, they blamed it on logistic issues at launch and etc. I mean, cmon, league is huge and very well polished as a game, and Demigod is not much more than an amateur game. Nevertheless, the devs did do a pretty good job with the game as it is, and it is quite fun to play once in a while.   P.S. I had a huge crush on queen of thorns when I was going through puberty. After puberty I realized that I was a fool.",

This game was Gifted to me by a friend and I have to say its a fun game for that style of gameplay.   This game however lacks characters... there are only two types... Tank/Healers and Assassin/Carry's. That is coupled with the fact there are only 8 choosable characters to play (+2 grey'ed out unchoosables... a DLC that didnt happen?) making gameplay a tad repetitive in the long run.  If you decide to pick this game up though be warned, there is no Online community for it anymore... pick it up knowing you will only be playing A.I. Bots solo  but for 2.50 (the sale price) its totally worth it as a great casual hour killing game. if you want to play this style of game Seriously though pick up League of Legends or DoTA2 (they are both free) they have huge communities and 'MLG' tournaments  7/10",

The level up system, including some carry over items that become permanate in your God is also very entertaining. If you can find a group to get in multiP it woud be nice and you'll enjoy it.

Skill trees are much more detailed &amp; allow for more possibilities than the normal 4-skill loadout that DOTA/LoL offers. Another thing that is offered is the ability to rotate your map, which is something that hasn't been offered by DOTA/LoL, yet. There are also a couple single player modes which is something that DOTA was never able to do &amp; LoL only allows in custom matches.

The multiplayer is all but dead - filled with nothing but elitists and impossible for newbies to get a game going. I played this about a year ago, so I can only imagine it is only more dead now.   I tried very hard to get a game going - went to the official forums and made a newbie thread and asked for anyone to play with me. Though some said yes, I never heard from them again and they didn't respond when I contacted them.   So I went into the online play in-game and joined one of the three games they had going - all were elitist games that didn't want newbies - I tried anyway because I was sick of single player. Told them up-front that I was new. I was kicked and told to go to another game that was in the lobby - so I did. Then they kicked me and told me to go to the one I was just kicked from.   Finally I met someone willing to play with me. The most horrible thing happened: The game crashed in the last 3 minutes of the game. It was already a done game - he was attacking my primary base. Somehow the game awarded me the win though - told me that the other guy lost connection. I guess there is some glitch that people can take advantage of and do this - because as soon as I contacted him he called me a cheater and refused to talk to me and swore he was done trying to help 'fake' newbies.   I love the lore and the gameplay but since single player mode is bad, and multiplayer is practically unplayable I cannot recommend this game at all.",
