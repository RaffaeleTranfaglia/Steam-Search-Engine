Unless you try to obtain all eleven cores you won't see just how true this is or how devious the developers have been!  Skill, not luck, rules in this game. Those who say otherwise are, in my view, mistaken... Experimentation is encouraged via 'seemingly' generous save points and it's best achievements will encourage you to play it several times with various completion aims in mind.  Five hours of real entertainment(if you push yourself to unlock all of it's secrets), something you don't always get from games costing many times as much!",

            "review_text": "Out There Somewhere is a 2014 platformer developed by unknown studio Miniboss. Another in a long line of Super Metroid lookalikes, it's enjoyed some success mainly due to being incredibly cheap.   But rather then simply riding on the coattails of Super Metroid (or Knytt, as it were), Out There Somewhere proves to be an enjoyable linear puzzle platformer, with a teleportation mechanic that features conservation of momentum similar to Portal (though the two have no real similarity beyond that). It's no metroidvania by any stretch of the imagination - most of the 'upgrades' are for an endgame effect that doesn't amount to much, and outside of that venture there's a total of 5 collectibles.   Instead of playing a retro pixel wannabe, I played a well-paced linear adventure, that nevertheless isn't perfect.   Most of the pacing is due to just how short it is - a playthrough won't run you longer than an hour (15 minutes if you know what you're doing) and the sheer lack of enemy variety becomes apparent on subsequent playthroughs. Add to that, that while the sprites are well designed and look quite nice on inspection (thankfully, not using the retro clause of pixel art to turn out subpar product) the very poorly handed tiling and lack of visual noise make the game's art look much more amateur than it really is.  This is most readily apparent during the intro and outro space battles. With a closer look, you can see the spaceships slowly rotating, the metal sheens and the sci fi aesthetic shining through, when taken as a whole it looks so empty and barren that you could mistake it for a first-year highschooler's Game Maker project.   These aren't particularly pressing issues; Out There Somewhere suffers from a lack of talking points. This isn't a particularly interesting game, and for all the secrets thrown into its linear world or the cool design of the protagonist, if this game hadn't gone for 20 cents then I wouldn't be recommending it. I wouldn't have even bought it. I've played Newgrounds games with more lasting value.   At $5, I wouldn't recommend it unless you're the type that goes for 100% completion. At the ridiculous sales price, I fully recommend Out There Somewhere as a snack-sized short romp to pace out the larger, more memorable videogames.",

The vast majority of the game is simple puzzle platforming with a teleport gun with a small scroll shooter segment at the beginning and end. I understand this is indie and short, but I liked it so much I wish there were more planets and scroll shooter segments to play. You encounter some alien species and a few power-ups for your ship, but it's only for one more shooter segment. I think it would be cool to extend this idea into a larger game with explorable planets and just more of the same fun.  I recommend this game because it's great and very fun, but it is short.

            "review_text": "The game feels a lot like a student project more than a completed video game.  The story is almost non-existant, all you know is that you crash land on a planet and need to defeat some Russian named fellow.  The gameplay, while decent, feels very unoriginal. Sure the idea of a gun that teleports you to where it hits seems novel at first, but the game doesn't really do much to challenge the player with the ideas presented by the gun. Also, the only real areas that feel like you would benefit from understanding the game's mechanics are, oddly enough, the first few screens. You can shave off, roughly, 15 seconds there by using teleport and jumps and just knowing how the jumping as a whole works.  The absolute worst part of the game is the beginning and ending SHUMP sections though. The devs must not have known how to make a very good SHUMP because what they put forth was one of the worst I've ever experienced. The ship has can take several hits, which is nice because the hit detection can be a little wonky, but there's a lot of things that are just plain wrong. There's no invulnerablity at all after being hit in the ship, which means if you move incorrectly and get hit once you aren't given any time to regroup, you need to go into full panic mode. This also leads to another interesting glitch, which is also present in the normal sections of the game, if you get hit by something that explodes you take three hearts of damage. Be it a plane or missile in the SHUMP sections or the big monster's explosive shots. On the brightside, this allows you to finish the opening SHUMP section in 3 seconds as you only need to crash onto the planet and not beat the Russian guy.  The game is a good pickup if it's really cheap, because you won't be able to squeeze much more than 4 hours out of it, assuming you're attempting to 100% it, and those 4 hours will definitely not involve you being fully engrossed by the game.  If you want a Metroidvania game with more depth I recommend the Shantae games or Guacamelee.",

I highly recommend to play this game with a Game Pad, because it is a little bit awkward with the keyboard. (Compareable to 'Super Meat Boy' + Keyboard' just worse...!)  Difficulty: 10/10 Although you cannot adjust the difficulty in the game options you are able to play this game without getting frustrated. There are maybe some points where it can take a minute longer than usual but all in all the game is quiet easy. But it gets much more difficult when you try to find all cores or try to collect all steam achievements.",

However it still plays differently. you start with a ship - and it is some sort of 'asteroids game' - eventually you will lose and u will crash - - you have to find the missing parts of the ship. You have a teleport gun - if u shoot - there will be a projectile flying - which will let you teleport if hit to a wall.  the game could be quite difficult too and with there puzzles. You also need intelligence and quick thinking in order to pass some area's. There are save stations/checkpoints throughout the level. It is also a little bit of 'metroidvania' that u have to go back point to point to do somethimg. but so far i know - you do not have a map which COULD be dissappointing the music is quite ok - it is 2D side scrolling 8 bit graphic style. monsters will respawn if u left the screen - the sound affects 'from guns, exploding, deaths, etc' are a little bit cheap - i mean, its a very very old sound effect. You can play with an xbox controller. Which actually plays better then on keyboard Default keyboard controls are weird. Z to teleport. X to jump. C to shoot. I think C should be jumping, Z to teleport and X to shoot. You can heal at checkpoints.  THE GAME IS OK BUT SHORT!   to make teleport useful - i do recommend using small hops, so that u can jump again once the projectile hit and u fly higher.  I give this a 6/10",

The main mechanic of this game is the teleportation system which is really cool, it allows for some really interesting puzzles that may require you to think about for a bit before you can complete them. In the same way Portal requires you to think with portals, this game requires you to think with perfectly timed teleportation.   Would reccomend it at the normal price.

I'm not a big fan of space adventures neither so much of shoot them all games but there are always chances for original exeptions to occur. Super metroid is an exeption in my tastes that I enjoy playing but I am not a fan at all of megaman or Metal Slug (from which I do enjoy at least the work on animation) though they are references for a certain amount of players. I wouldn't say it's a bad game but I'm not sure to find much entertainement in it to my concern unfortunately. It's important for this kind of game to show flawless design nowadays to be enjoyable. Although I give it a positive vote I do not enjoy it much yet. I'm not fan of minimalism or drab graphics (unless it would correspond to a choice that would help immersion like horror or a bit psychological or mental insanity) such as Risk of rain either unless there would be various worlds and that's why I will prefer games like Wings of Vi (very nice mix of difficulty a bit of gore and attractive design that is unsurprisely very successfully working on me) or Shantae or Fidding Teddy 2 where I appreciate the gameplay feeling and the atmosphere as well as the games it is inspired from. Any games that refer too much to realistic gun crafting and certain kinds of propaganda will highly increase chances to earn my dislike. Actually it's hard to define what makes old school like games attractive. But there are some ingredients that will most often help to make them enjoyable to replay more than once. It still remains very subjective as we are not always in the mood for the same things as well as we don't want to eat the same things everyday.",

The sprite art isn't particularly inspired and the environments are bland, but the games aesthetic isn't in any way bad. The music is along the same lines, passable, with really only one tune being moderately memorable. The teleportation mechanic here is used ocassionally well but never to any mindbending extent, though there is some promise in the nuances, and would be great to expand upon to make it more twitch based or have more intricare puzzles. It's definitely not a portal rip-off, and has plenty of its own imaginitive power, so hopefully that can be fleshed out if there's ever a sequel. Overall it was definitely worth 2 bucks.",

This is a great game, the soundtrack is pretty good, the graphics look classic and neat, it's game mechanics are easy to understand and fun to use and Playing with an Xbox 360 controller makes it control amazingly. However, there're two main gripes I have with this game. First of all, the length, I played this completely blind, and I was able to complete it in about 2 hours, the story, and the game, feel pretty short. And second, the difficulty, It never gets or brutally hard or stupidly simple, but it's relatively easy, some of the 'Harder' screens in the game are pretty trivial, removing some of the challenge.  So overall, should you purchase this game? Yes... But I feel 5 dollars is a bit high, if you can find it discounted to any amount, pick it up as soon as you can, so you can waste a few hours shooting teleporting bullets and talking to aliens. 7/10",

Basically it's a platformer, with minor Shoot'em Up parts both at the beginning and the end of the game. Armed with a teleport gun and a space suit you control Captain Yuri on his journey to defeat the evil Grigori.  Simple control scheme: arrow keys and 3 others, Z X C by default, Europeans might want to swap Z with Y prior to starting. The game does have controller support, I used a keyboard though and had no problems.  Over the course of my several playthroughs and experiments I only encountered 1 or 2 minor bugs you wouldn't experience without specifically looking for it. Even if, none of them was game breaking. Otherwise it's got smooth and clean animations, perfect hitboxes and overall fair difficulty. There's no real tutorial but is streamlined on directs you perfectly through the mechanics, the growing complexity should be no problem for the average player. If you want all achievements though, you're in for a tougher challenge, brace yourself and activate your thinker.  As for the design, it's an adorable small indie treasure, you won't get 10 hours of excitement but instead you'll get challenging fun packed into a small platformer. Nothing looks out of place, everything fits into this colourfully bright (but not bilindingly bright) small universe. Even the music is brilliant for such a small game, it's repetetive but it doesn't get boring, this way it's even fun waiting for the 'delay' Achievement while doing something else. Only downside is there's no transition when the BGM changes but hey, it's not like that would hurt anyone  My first playthrough took me an hour and roughly 15 minutes, the only thing that really got on my nerves was clicking through Yuris messages on my playthroughs after the first one...  Bottom line: whatever you pay, it's a bargain",

Steam tells me it took me 9 hours, that was with several runs focusing on different achievements over the course of a few months and I enjoyed it.   Going through the game to see the ending takes about 1 to 1,5 hours on an average person's first playthrough, maybe more if you get stuck, but there are guides on Steam and on youtube just in case. The quick run achievement has a 20 minutes time limit, and that leaves quite some room for errors.

This is a puzzle platformer that is so fun because the puzzles are very satisfying to solve. At the beginning of the game i was a confused but I quickly picked up the game mechanics due to the games perfect learning curve. In other words when the game teaches a new mechanic, it starts off easy until you are familar with the mechanic, then harder till it becomes secondhand knowledge, and THEN thats when the game shows you the next new mechanic. Of course this is not to say that you will never be stumped at some parts, after all it is what makes a puzzle game a puzzle game and takes some creative thinking BUT is never anything ridiculous to solve. The main part about this game that is kept me so hooked were all the puzzles. The harder puzzles are extreamly satisfying to solve (plenty of 'OHHH!!' moments) and secrets are very rewarding to find. The puzzles in this game will never become stale, thats because even though the puzzles are essentially the same, the variations and new mechanics keep it very fun, enjoyable, and interesting to play. One more thing is that great soundtrack, props to them!  PROS -Great learning curve -Puzzles never get boring -New Mechanics add depth -Puzzles are very satisfying to solve -Puzzles are so clever (I know i've said it a bunch but I really love the puzzles!!!) -Great price -Secrets keep the game interesting -Never too easy or too hard -Awesome music to play to  CONS -None (I can't complain as the game has everything advertised plus much more and FAR exceded my expectations)  The game is short and can not really be a con for being so, as it cost me a mere $0.21. (But the game is so awesome that I wanted more)  The reason I have more than 4 hours is because I tried to get all the 'Abandoned Cores' and 'Ancient Artifacts'  Bottomline : get this game while it's still on sale, but if it's not... still get it cause it's awesome.  P.S The very beginning with the old arcade shooter mini game is an awesome little 'backstory' and an interesting way start off the game and if you survive long enough it will explain what the 'Abandoned Cores' do and what the boss looks like (you can't defeat him!)",

TL;DR: twitch based puzzle plafomer, think VVVVVV with fancier graphics, no exploration aspect, and different mechanics.  1st off: unlike what the tags currently say; this is not in any way a metroidvania, metroidvanias are distinguished by a big focus on exploration, ferreting out secrets, etc. You don't do that in OTS, the game is very linear, backtracking is impossible, etc. Its similar to a metroidvania in the sense that there is just 1 big map... but thats about it.  What the game actually is at heart is a fairly difficult puzzle platformer, with a big focus on the platforming, you WILL need some good twitch skills to get thru some of the mid/late game rooms. Think VVVVVV except instead of swapping gravity you jump, shoot, &amp; teleport, and you'll have a good idea.  Oh, and also there are space shooter sequences right at the beginning &amp; end.  If you want a cheap, short, challenging game to kill a weekend afternoon, this is a good buy. Just be aware its only around 2 hours or so for a playthru, the platforming is very twitch, and it aint got any exploration.",

And while the puzzles involving the aforementioned teleport gun are definitely interesting, the claimed inspiritations led me to believe I would have a bigger arsenal at my disposal. Another issue I have with the game is the use of bullet hell-like portions of the game. These sections feel very out of place in a game that is otherwise essentially a 2D version of Portal.  Out There Somewhere is a decent game, considering the price, but the tauted inspirations to me implied a set of standards that the game did not deliver. Like I said above, this is 2D Portal.
