            "review_text": "Despite the big thumbs up, I wouldn't recommend the game at its full price. It's good but you can get a lot more with $10 on Steam.  As for the content itself, its atmosphere sort of reminds me of a 3D Sword &amp; Sworcery. However, I found Sword &amp; Sworcery to be little more than a collection of pixel art and mysterious but ultimately meaningless dialogue whereas I found Continue to have genuine meaning that you can connect to your own life. The gameplay is not the focus in either game, but it is at least entertaining in Continue. Where it really excels is in its metaphorical meaning,  It is more art than game, designed to make you think as you race against time to build up what resistance you can to a fate you ultimately cannot escape. There is little replayability; you will discover most of what the game has to offer in a few short playthroughs. But I wouldn't call that a fault considering the goal of the game is to explore a theme, not to provide hours of entertainment. If that doesn't appeal to you, then avoid the game; otherwise, it's something to look into.",

I really, really want to like it, but there's just nothing in it that leads you down the path I was hoping to find myself on, and that's a really unfortunate let down...",

            "review_text": "When I first saw this game in the Greenlight queue, I was astonished. The trailer looked wonderful. An action/platformer that is esentially a deep meditation on the existence of video game characters, with a simplistic yet stylish look, and not to mention, a great track to accompany the whole affair.   Once I saw it available in the Steam market, I bought it immediately (this never happens).  What I got was a little different than what I expected.  Yes, the deep philosophical message was there. The eerie, ethereal atmosphere was there. The melodious, calming soundtrack was there. But gameplay was not. At least, not what I was expecting exactly.  The game opens with a very beautiful sequence of death and transcendence into the after life (In terms of a defeated video game character). As wonderful as this opening is, you will get very sick of it. You will die quickly from the get go, and you will see this long cut scene each time you restart. But the first time around, it really sets the tone and feel of what is happening. Very melancholic and simple with an underlying complexity. From here on out is where my feelings for this game took a turn.  From the trailer, it looked very Zelda-ish (to which I'm a sucker for. See my review of 'Anodyne'). This was certainly not the case. You did not really have freedom to explore. By freedom, I mean with enough time. As soon as this starts, you are on a kind of timer for each world. After a certain amount of time, the world around starts to fall apart and glitch; the system is essentially trying to delete you for good. You have to do a lot of walking around, talking, while every once in a while being subjected to a rather lackluster battle sequence. The point is to get out of the area you are in and move to the next area. Now, there is also a small town in another area of the game. It is here that you build up buildings which will also be subjected to termination. At some point in the game (I forget when, as it has been some time since I've played this game) you go into the town. The program starts systematically deleting the buildings. If you get hit by a lightning bolt, you are deleted, and this results in a game over. Then, it is time to start again, from the very beginning.  The game is rather difficult, and when I played, I found it annoyingly difficult to survive inside of the small town you construct. No matter where I went or the buildings I had, that bolt found its way to me, resulting in an instant game over.  I might give it another go another time, but it was a big disappointment. I like how they tried to really do something different, but in the end it wasn't fun. I give it a perfect ten for style and music, but for gameplay...let's just say I give it a much lower score. Maybe if it had been more free and open world, then it would have worked well. I don't expect a Zelda knock-off AGAIN...but Anodyne seemed to manage being Zelda without being Zelda.  Sorry creators of Continue?9876543210....Great concept. Not so great execution.",

            "review_text": "This game is the most mixed-up 'mixed bag' i've ever played.  The good stuff- the idea is amazing, and the game captures the sense of hopelessness that wandering lost around the recesses of RAM might entail. I really like the dialogue too, which has a kind of meaningful meaningless quality, like haikus written by a gifted chimp. The music is quite good, and the basic organisation of the game (wandering around talking to people, finding clues, collecting game resources and then battling to save yourself) is well organised and a good idea for how to conduct this kind of game. So based on originality and thoughtfulness, it would be a 10/10.  However, the execution of the above gameplay is a solid 0/10, and since the gameplay is most of the game, it hurts the overall experience really badly. Generally, the game well captures the futility of trying to escape deletion because it is nigh impossible not to fail over and over and over again, based on flaws in the game mechanics rather than your skill. The combat is incredibly bad, making safe zones suddenly kill you, murdered enemies spring back to instantly and unavoidably shave off half your health (every enemy can do this), and enemies spawn teleported right on top of you to instantly initiate punishing combat with no chance to evade.  The punishment for failure also increase geometrically- every time you make a mistake, the punishment gets worse by 1. For reference, you need to build shelters towards surviving a storm every few levels, and each shelter takes a couple of conversations or minigames to build, with bigger (more effective) shelters taking more. Then when you fail, you lose a shelter. Fail twice, lose 2. Fail 5 times (throughout the whole playthrough), and you lose 5, then 6, then 7 shelters each time. Given how arbitrarily you fail, and that the game actively selects your biggest and most valuable shelters for deletion (i've played it enough to be sure this isn't random chance), the possiblity of getting past level 3 or 4 is extremely low for any given playthrough. Add in poor collision detection with environments (falling off parts of maps to your death), continue screens which also delete between 1 and 7 shelters every time, and randomised puzzles and level order, and you have a recipe for extremly consistent frustration. So I give the gameplay 0/10, with the developer either being really lazy on this element (doing no playtesting to realise what a piece of junk his game is to actually 'play') or really hostile to people who pay for his work (taking the 'avoiding deletion is really hard' story element as an excuse to ruin the gameplay element of the game).  I still really enjoyed Continue?, finding it artsy and thoughtful without being too pretentious. But being almost impossible to finish due to game design unfortunately takes it down quite a few notches.",

In my experience, Swords and Sourcery was the first of an indie game line up to use an obsure script, lovely art direction and slow-paced gameplay to execute an original, experiential game.  The idea of Continue? 0987654321, is kind of cool (A game character runnung around RAM)... but it seems to me like it's relying on the concept to appeal the indie fans, over content. The game feels uncrafted. The script is gibberish. Fighting (if you can call it that) is shallow and unsatisfying. The graphics at first seem cool, but quickly become dull, bland and uninspired.  Maybe they wanted to get it out the door faster. I think more time and more original ideas could've made this a sweet game. Iwant to like it. I want to want to play it more... but there are better games to spend my time on.  5/10",

            "review_text": "If you are looking for a game that has a lot of replayability or huge amounts of random number generation then this game is not for you. For the full price it may be expecting a lot so I would suggest getting it at a discount.  Continue?9876543210 is a game that has the feeling of the existence and what happens to video game characters that die, in a way. Death in a game, when we see it is just that. We reload and continue our attempt. But if we are to imagine that the game is truly 'alive' then what do the characters do? Are they spontaneously erased or do they remain until they are cleaned up at some point?  This game makes you think. And with the music the game uses combines with that feeling of nothingness or the bleak feeling.  Gameplay is simple yet a bit repetitive. You run around and talk to people in order to clear an exit or protection in future levels. The levels come in two types after the first one. They are 4 rounds of 45 seconds or 2 rounds of 1 minutes. In order to proceed to the next level it is best to ration what little time and pick the route to go. Otherwise the protection obtained will be lost. When the garbage collection hits the player is thrown into a minilevel where the goals are varied.  Story is the same no matter what character it is. Going in expecting multiple stories will set you up for disappointment and once you finish the game the need to replay it dimishes rapidly. What is generated is the character's appearance, gender, and name.  I, myself, found this fulfilling and I liked the style, the feeling it gives and the story it wanted to tell. As the developer said this is a love/hate thing. So take this with a grain of salt.",

            "review_text": "I've never wanted to give a game a great review so badly and been so disappointed. The game itself isn't BAD...it's just not good, either.   In this you play a video game character who got killed, but refuses to die. Your goal is to evade the Garbage Collector, a real-life programming construct that clears out the memory of a computer when variables fall out of scope or are nullified....such as a character from a video game dying and vanishing from the landscape. In it, a randomly generated series of worlds will be how you progress in your effort to resist death. It felt like pixellation meets the movie Mirrormask at first, but only at first.   It didn't take long to find myself frustrated at the lack of directional cues. I love open world games, but this isn't one, so you need some idea of what to do next. The devs did try to give us the appropriate clues, but much of the adventure has you staring down choices without any context for them. An example (in logic, not actually from the game): you're running across a field and meet a merchant. He wants to sell you a vial of cough medicine or a toaster. Up to this point, you've seen no chance to use either a toaster or cough medicine. You think, 'gee, medicine will help' and buy it...only to find a villager later who wants a toaster, and the GC destroyed the world selling toasters already. You play through that part again, make the other choice....and it turns out now it's a woman with a terrible cough who holds the key to your salvation.  The 'Nintendo Hard on Accident' nature of the game kinda killed it for me. It doesn't have the ability to ♥♥♥♥ you off and make you want more liek FTL and other really hard, really good games do. You just get annoyed with the PS1 style graphics and decide Minecraft is better; after all, you can figure out the rules there. This is a relatively hard, very confusing, and loses its novelty rapidly. Pick it up if it's a buck. Otherwise, there's a reason that the Garbage Collector exists, and it's best to let this game fall out of scope.",
