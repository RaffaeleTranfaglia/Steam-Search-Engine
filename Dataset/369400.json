The cat customisation is more in depth than that of Need For Speed 2015. Would definitely put this game up there with the ratings of Skyrim and Grand Theft Auto V. 10 out of 10.

The diffucutly isn't really there. I find i restart once or twice before solving the puzzle but crazy machines on other hand has a nice diffuculty level that isn't to easy nor very hard. another thing that annoys me is when you finish 5 levels you go up a floor, you see two floors at once but instead of a nice scrolling effect to go up 1 floor it goes there immedently and i find going to a level 5 levels ahead where im at and i get confused. even better, later on you have to use the stars you get for completing a level earlier on and spend them to unlock more, i understand if it was a requirement to have minimun of said stars but to take them away, this means if you're to intrested putting hats on your cat likes its TF2 your screwed.

Chop all of the remaining ingredients that shall be chopped. Put a dollop of butter into the carafe, let it melt and then put the onion and the garlic in the carafe and fry it for about half an hour. Season with ginger. Add coconut milk, cream and meat extract and let it cook for two hours – it should get really warm. After that add the cat meat and wait a bit longer. Finally add pimiento pieces, lime juice and season generously with freshly ground black pepper and just a little salt. Turn off your coffee maker.  The best way to serve this delicious cat stew is accompanied by a glass of a tasty red wine and freshly baked bread. Congrats you're done!",
