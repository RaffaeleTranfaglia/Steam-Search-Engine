            "review_text": "First up, YOU HAVE TO OWN MANSIONS OF MADNESS 2ND EDITION BOARD GAME to get anything from this app. Right with that out of the way, let me review it.  Played Mansion of Madness last weekend using the Android version of this app (techinally identical) and it just works. All the players really enjoyed the experience, which went on for several hours (we played the first scenario I suspect it took about 3 - 3 1/2 hours) totally engrossing thou'   The app runs the game, and it does a mighty fine job of it. When you choose to interact with objects or fight it will randomly pick a stat or give a cool description to your action. Like for instance unarmed combat might be  'You look around a room for anything to hit the monster with do a test on obvservation' or it might say 'You take a flying kick at the monster putting all your weight behind it, do a test on strength'.   We found the app worked best when one person controls it and reads out what happens (especially with a pc/laptop version). The only real other time the other players get to use it is for solving puzzles. There are a few changes I'd like to see. One is the puzzles themselves, before attempting to solve it would be great if the app asks for the intelligence stat. Then only allow the player to do that number of moves rather than relying on them to be honest. Simple changes like that so mistakes can't be made.'  The great thing about the board game + app is no-one has any idea what is going to happen. The app controls it all, giving out random items at the start, and during the mythos phase sometimes randomly affecting a single investigator. I guess the same senario has the same backstory, but randomisation on the maps,clues should make for interesting games.   Finally it keeps track of the puzzles, and monster life stats, meaning you can just get on and play the game :D",

Plus you can add almost all of your first edition content to it, making them practically expansions to this one! Who wouldn't want to randomly walk into the Dunwich horror on the streets of Insmouth!?  ",
