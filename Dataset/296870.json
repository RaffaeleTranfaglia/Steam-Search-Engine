By Yume Nikki in 2D i mean sidescrolling as opposed to RPGMakeresque top-down view. Yume Nikki 3D is a thing though. I think. Or maybe i dreamed that.",

Typically I don't really like such short games. A few hours can't possibly be enough time to really get a satisfying experience, right? This is more or less the only gripe I have with the game, though. I just wish there was  more.  It's a charming platformer with creative worlds to explore and nice atmospheric music to really suck you into this strange little land. (Oh, and a copy of the OST comes free with the game!) There are some bugs here and there, but I personally didn't run into anything gamebreaking, so I can't say I was too put-off on that front. Even then, the dev has been in the forums working to fix things as people report them, so with any luck that point will be resolved with time. As an inexpensive game that clearly has so much love put into it, I'd say despite the short hours it lasted, it was 100% worth the money I spent on it.",

It didn't take me long to beat, and you really don't need the walkthrough (unless you want to make sure you get the secret achievements :D) to beat it.

The story is about a girl who's apparently journeying around her subconcious. It may seem incoherent at first, but the game keeps giving you subtle hints. And all remaining questions are answered by an image after the ending credits.  The gameplay is relaxed and casual, closer to a 'walking simulator' rather than an actual platformer. There are some easy 'puzzles' and obvious 'secrets', which are more of an addition to the trippy atmosphere rather than a challenge-provider of any sort.  All in all, for me the game left a dreamy and serene aftertaste, so I can definitely recommend it. I especially liked the soundtrack, which is a decent example of the ambient genre - the devs appear to be artists indeed. What's more, it comes free as an album - another thanks for that.",

            "review_text": "Dreaming Sarah is an adventure/exploration game that is short enough to play in an evening while simultaneously delivering a fragmented (but by no means boring) storyline highly up for interpretation. Inspired by Japanese psychological/horror indie game Yume Nikki, it has a similar feel. Other than the obvious being that they are both exploration games taking place in a dream world, both have surreal music, at times disturbing art choices in character design, and a female protagonist with no dialogue. Also, both have artifact collection, with the game ending basically when you finish collecting all of them.  Whereas I enjoyed this game, I did feel as though it was just a lighter, more simplified, version of Yume Nikki in a lot of ways. Although they share many characteristics, Dreaming Sarah lacked the same amount of depth, and did not do much in adding to the genre.   That being said, the creator is upfront about it being a major source of inspiration for him, and there is at least one easter egg of Madotsuki's shirt's symbol on a bulletin board in one of the locations (there might be more, but I was giddy to find this one).   For the price it's being sold at, I would recommend this game. It's fun, doesn't have any boring tutorials, and most of all is an experience in surrealism that toys with your psyche.    Pros:  - Gameplay was simple and easy to get into - Puzzles/exploration wasn't too dumbed down - Character and level designs were interesting - Good music  Cons: - Didn't add anything to the genre - A little glitchy",

            "review_text": " We dream every night, regardless if we remember it or not.   Dreams are an important part of who we are. It is through them that we solve daily problems, face our fears and, sometimes, come to understand ourselves.   Dreaming Sarah  accomplishes exactly that: in a pixelated and rich platforming scenario we dwell into Sarah's mind to find out what exactly is bothering her. But it isn't as simple as that. The story starts off unassuming, mascarading itself as just another adventure platformer with nothing new to add to the genre. That's just meant to fool you, for as the story develops one is quick to grasp that, just like dreams, the game offers so much more behind what can be seen at first.  The game is creative and confusing, eye catching and trippy – all whilst maintaining coherence between Sarah, 'random' NPCs and inventory items. You will never get to know Sarah just by looking at what she does or the little she herself sometimes reveals. Her dreams scream of her identity, what she caries of her needs and desires, and who she envisions in her dreams of her past, her fears and her story.  All in all this is a solid indie game that leaves a short but sweet note at what dreams are, who we are in them and what one can be willing to see in if one looks deep enough – and there is hardly anything deeper that one's subconscious mind.  I recommend this game for the  good story ,  well done platforming ,  interesting NPCs ,  disturbing sights  and  meaningful details .  I don't think the  short length  or the  unremarkable music  are big enough downsides to stop anyone from playing this, even more so when the first one is more of an upside than downside and the second one is not the focus of the game.  As much attention as this game is getting, I'm of the firm conviction that it deserves even more.",

            "review_text": "Dreaming Sarah is unfortunately a disappointment. The visuals and music are both quite pleasing, but they're attached to an essentially mediocre puzzle platformer. The puzzles themselves are generally simple to solve, but are throttled by tedious back-tracking and slow-paced exploration. The platforming itself is a chore with no challenge. At under 2 hours for completing all achievements, there isn't a whole lot here, but unfortunately by the end it already felt too long. Most of that time was spent running back and forth through the same areas, which lost much of their charm in the process. There are shortcuts revealed throughout, as well as an item that can teleport you back to the start, but even with that, traversing the small map areas becomes tedious. There's not much story to get involved in; the dibs and drabs of text that come out are largely disjointed and don't form any sort of narrative. Given that the game is a dream sequence that could be forgiven; if there were more to the game itself then the lack of story or character development wouldn't be an issue. Some older reviews mentioned technical issues. I didn't find any in my play through. I would like to point out that there is an umbrella in the game that lets you float around, which is needed for some puzzles but can be used everywhere. It's a pretty enjoyable enjoyable mechanic, and jumping and floating through each stage is the one nice break from the tedium.  As I said before, the art and sound are both nice, and are what initially got me to make the purchase. But nice visual design and soundtrack can't make up for the flaws in the actual game. I bought it on sale for under $3, but unfortunately even if it were free I would have been displeased, as the time spent was not really worth it.",

I don't know if I'm the only one who's had this issue, but finishing the game was pretty difficult for me, since it doesn't really have any form of guidance (sometimes the compass will just not work outright, but that could also be caused by Sarah's coma) and the different areas can get confusing pretty quickly (I had to refer to a guide on Steam for the last couple achievements). Nevertheless, it was a great experience playing this game and I don't regret buying it. If I were a game critic, I'd probably give this game a rating of 7 or 7.5/10. Good job, Asteristic!",

Things to expect from this game: + lots of running around to explore and figure things out (I was stuck a lot and I admit, I had to google some things which I did not mind at all!) + Around 1-3 hours play time. + Very subtle, obscure humour (which I absolutely loved) + A linear story (you have to do XYZ or you won't progress) + beautiful, atmospheric score + incredibly imaginative art and design (possibly my favourite bit about this game!)  Fantastic indie game that works like a charm on the PC with an XBOX 360 controller.  What can I say? I bought this game on sale for literally nothing because I wanted to get back into gaming and the look of the game intrigued me.
