Just a damn good example of how environment design, sound mixing and unique mechanics can set such a great mood.  Unfortunately contains a few (seemingly random) game-breaking bugs where enemies refuse to spawn. It's a short game though (~30 minutes), so starting over doesn't feel like much of a chore.  Highly recommend.",

            "review_text": "They Breathe is a strange game that can not be categorized into any genre. You play as a frog that jumps into a body of water. Not sure if it is a pond or what. Your goal is to save as many drowning frogs as you can by pushing them into air bubbles until they regain enough to swim away to the surface. I use the word goal lightly as it doesn't really matter if you save them or not. The two enemies is a cow like creature and a jellyfish which will consume you. If a jellyfish consumes a drowning frog it becomes much more powerful. You can defeat these enemies by either waiting until they run out of breath or guiding them into air bubbles. They get stronger and faster when they get a air bubble so it may be better to simply out maneuver them until they drown.  Environments are cool and spooky looking the deeper down you go. The game itself actually has a creepy vibe to it which suits it perfectly considering all the animals you will see drown. The moody music you will hear throughout is pretty great too. There isn't really much to talk about this game as it is a very simple game and also about 20 minutes long. It's not an expensive game by any means but that may turn some people off. Not much to do other than dodge enemies and collect bubbles to stay alive. That does lead to some pretty cool moments where you have to decide if your own life is more valuable than the random drowning frog next to you. Even if you die though you will respawn in the last check point which will be just right before an enemy encounter.  I don't really see the point of dragging this review out. This is a good and interesting game with a very memorable ending. The short length of the game is both a blessing and a curse. On one hand it keeps the simple gameplay from getting stale but on the other hand it is a 20 minute game. I do think this is a game worth experiencing but do expect an artsy type of game instead of a gameplay focused one. It is certainly unique I'll give it that and it's visually appealing. Though there is no real reason to replay it once you finish so be sure of what you are getting when you purchase this. Recommended to those that want a very short but memorable experience.",

            "review_text": "Absolutely fantastic game. It certainly makes an argument for games as experiences rather than mindless, graphics-focused fodder.  Gameplay had a nostalgic, almost retro feel (this is a good thing) - tight, simplistic controls, with thoughtful, challenging level design. Nothing is spoonfed, leaving it up to the player to deduce how to proceed as each adversary presents itself.  The atmosphere is fantastic, utilizing excellent sound design and unnerving imagery to produce an almost suffocating, dark tension. Even without an obvious storyline present, the game clearly communicates that the protagonist's objective is much more dire and grave than we're initially led to believe from the title screen.  I highly recommend this - $2 is an absolute steal for this surprisingly deep, beautiful work.",

            "review_text": "This game freaked me out the first time I played it, because it was not what I was expecting. The underlying irony and cruelty in the game really got me, but it was neverless an enjoyable play. I would definately reccomend this game.  The music was excellent. It was a very low, abianient style that had me connect with the game on a deeper level rather than just in-my-face loudness. Although the game did not have a huge variety of tracks and the tracks themselves were rather simple, this made it all the more enoyable to play along with.  Gameplay was also fairly great. The controls were simple and relatively easy to master and later on this was tested, which made the game much better. Parts of the gameplay were hard to grasp at first, like saving the frogs and the jellyfish stuff, which you needed to grasp fast or else you would restart the wave. The waves system was also an enjoyable part of the gameplay that made sense in context with the story.  Finally, the story. It's pretty simple, you can basiclly read the game discription and you won't get too much more storywise from playing the game. The twists and turns of the game and the game's exploition of this, however, made the simple story of a frog's 'there and back' more intresting and exciting.  Overall, I would reccomend this game to someone who enjoys simple, not blatently violent games with an indie touch to it. Once you complete it you basically never need to play it again but in my case I enjoyed playing this several more times and explored different stratagies of winning and achivement hunting. Definately an enjoyable play, 4.5 out 5 only because of the possibility of making it longer might have, in my opinion, made it better.",

Art and backgrounds are amazing. Music and sound fit in very well. And by the time I got to the bottom I was extremely uncomfortable. I knew there was a surprise, but I don't think I could have expected what I found. The game tells a horrifying story without even saying a single word. There really are no explinations given in the game, so it is up to the player to make discoveries.   I found the game interting to play through again once I knew what was going on, but outside of that it doesn't have much replay value. I don't mean to say this as a negative thing, but just know that unless you are going for achievements you are going to get about 30 or so minutes out of this game.   Highly recommend, wish there were more games like this.",

All I can really say is try the game, it's not a long game though it has replay value, but with the same cost of a morning coffee it  really  pays for itself with the experience you get, give it a try.",

The issue is the game is 20-minutes long at best, meaning the $2 price tag is a bit much for what is essentially a moody website game, thankfully on sale it's pennies on the dollar. I don't think it's a waste of time and actually think everyone should play it, it just doesn't feel like something you should be paying for to experience. But I suppose that's up to you and the devs.  There are achievements that could potentially add logetivity to the experience if that's your thing, but I feel they're misplaced in what is essentially and atmospheric art piece.  Still, check it out if you can pick it up on the cheap.",

There is no introduction, no tutorial to show you how to play the game; you have to learn it all by yourself. I first didn't get the sense of this, but after playing a few minutes, it was obvious that the developers want the player to feel like the little helpless frog in the game, having to get to know the environment (or the controls ;) ) in order to survive.

            "review_text": "Whether you were there for the stream or not, it went down. All the way to the bottom. Letâ€™s get started on this review.  I â€“ Story [10/10]  They Breathe from The Working Parts is what it is. It is a harrowing, terrifying journey through a flooded forest (gone mad) by the unlucky Glenn the frog. The deeper downward you swim, the more eerie and disturbing it gets. Itâ€™s your job to survive in a twisted ecosystem where the only thing that matters is getting oxygen. I wonâ€™t say too much else. If you were watching the stream (on Twitch or Steam) youâ€™ve seen it for yourself whether you pieced the story together or not. If you werenâ€™t watching the stream, youâ€™ll have to find out for yourself what makes this bizarre environment tick.  II â€“ UI [5/10]  They Breathe has almost no user interface whatsoever. From the moment you dive into the deluge, itâ€™s every frog for themselves. You are given one clue as to what you can do to swim faster, and boy will you need it. Aside from this, the only time any sort of directional HUD appears on screen is if you manage to swim outside of the current boundaries. While this is incredibly useful, I felt very conflicted about it because it detracted from the atmosphere of the game as a whole.  III â€“ Gameplay [10/10]  The controls of They Breathe are as simple as they come. Youâ€™ll make use of only two controls; swimming in any given direction and swimming faster in any given direction. Youâ€™re left to figure things out for yourself when it comes to offense.   IV â€“ Content [10/10]  What They Breathe lacked in physical content, they made up for in mental trauma.  V â€“ Visual [6/10]  The visuals of They Breathe are hand-drawn and, for the most part, are just alright compared to most other games who share that artistic trait. While subtlety creepy, I personally feel that they could have been better.  VI â€“ Audio [10/10]  The majority of the game is deathly quiet apart from water-like ambiance and the terror-inducing screams of your enemies. When the music does come though, it comes in at just the right moment.  VII â€“ Overall [8.5/10]  Overall, They Breathe is a fantastic game, especially for such a low price.",

But do I think it is as good as everyone seems to claim currently? No - definitely not.  It looks and feels like one of those flash game we had in the first half of the 2000s. You scroll down for 20 minutes and try to avoid getting hit by enemies. After that there is a little surprise, but the game is over nonetheless. So if you manage to get this game for (near) free from somewhere give it a try, but I can't really recommend it.",

Ultimately the game had a slightly disturbing atmosphere, though the enemies that were meant to be, I assume, the most disturbing suffered from a rather comical appearance. The final boss also leaned more towards annoying than difficult as it has you repeat several tasks a number of times when once is enough to get all the enjoyment you will from the 'challenge'.  For two bucks you can't really go wrong but you could do better. Understand that you're buying a half-hour game that, while mildly atmospheric, doesn't have a whole lot to offer in the way of gameplay.",

Playtime is about 30 minutes, which is something I actually see as a positive. I wish there were more games which could tell a story and not require committing so much time to complete them.  I can somehow recommend this game if it's part of a bundle. $2 is not a lot, but it's not difficult to find better games that are on sale for roughly the same amount.",

The art style looked fun, the theme of the game was interesting, and I suckered myself into thinking that it would be one of those indie games that would be great, after hearing great things about it. I was wrong. The game has no substance. Sure it could be creepy if you put yourself into that mindset, but in all reality, I felt no emotion towards the game whatsoever. The gameplay is basic. You use the arrow keys or WASD to move your little frog around the screen, and enemies come in waves to kill you. This helps push the game in the wrong direction in my opinion, as I felt like it become repetitive far too quickly, surprising being that the game is only a half an hour long. The ending made no sense and was stupid, but maybe I was supposed to do something that I didn't, I'm not sure. The game just felt like a waste of time to me, even though I payed a sum of about 70 cents on it.  My verdict: 4/10  There are better games out there for your money, just look for them. Don't let art style style fool you and don't believe people like Markiplier.",

On the other hand it is easily finished in 30 minutes and, to me at least, just wasn't satisfying. I mean, can a game really be that short and still be worth selling? I feel like the dev's should have made a few hours worth of content before releasing this. Its only $2.00 but I would much rather pay $10 for a game that I can play for longer than it takes me to eat my breakfast. Others have said it has replay value... I see none.",
