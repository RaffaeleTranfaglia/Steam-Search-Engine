            "review_text": "This game is the love child of Galaga and Radiant with a mix of Radian feel.  This is a rapid pace game which relies heavily on power-ups and upgrades to your ship, with additional weapons to be purchased from the in-game store to help you fight your way against the endless hoard. The Store front is hard to see at certain times, being a light blue color on top of many bright objects could be a pain to see what of 3 tabs your on. Tabs included Weapons/Ship/Upgrades. As you defeat enemies, \\'cash\\' is dropped and you buy upgrades when it says it is available to buy via the indicater on the top left of the screen.  Complaints: As of this review, you cannot reassign keys. Menus are chunky;The exit menu while playing the game keeps on going leaving you to do as you exit. (Bug/Exploit: Exitting whle playing will remove all points and level area upon returning, but the lives/levels and upgrades are kept)And navigating the store is a pain, you can\\'t fully rotate,even though there is 3 choices. Selecting upgrades via an up/down menu is useful, but when getting on later levels, the bottom isn\\'t needed, but when you die, your in the same place where you left off, meaning you have to scroll all the way back down.   Also, Many things are red. MANY THINGS! A coin is both yellow and red, with the red one dropping more. You know what looks like a coin? Those slow moving explosive dots that look like a coin with a trail, palette changes would be nice or a new section to say what upgrades do and what to avoid.  OverAll: You\\'ll get a good hour or two worth of fun in one sitting. Steady and fast gameplay. You could get out of your vechile when it gets downed at some point(Don\\'t know how or why). It\\'s a vertical shooter, with nice graphics and upgrades  Also Steam Trading Cards, Sell those I guess?",

            "review_text": "Most of my 'playtime' is actually from idling to get the cards. All in all I spent maybe five minutes actually playing this atrocity.  Bad controls, confusing visuals, boring upgrade system and a weird resolution/aspect ratio all come together to form a game that is somehow less than the sum of its parts, if that makes sense. I am not the first to say these things, but I certainly wouldn't mind being the last one.",
