            "review_text": "As I'm writing this, I've played this game 700 hours and I've enjoyed every minute of it. It's hard to think of a better value for the money. No game is perfect, but this one has just the right recipe for me. In addition, a year after release the devs are still very attentive, cranking out updates, bug fixes and DLC. They have also released editing tools and tutorial videos for the modding community.  I've seen negative reviews written by people who played only a few hours, were stumped by some problem outside the game (computer or network problems, most often game controller problems) and had no patience to try to make it work for them. I use two full-size joysticks, a steering wheel and pedals, with no problem whatsoever. All these devices are 10 years old and my computer is 6 years old.  I've also seen complaints by people with unrealistic expectations. While CS2015 is not a perfect technical simulator (what do you expect, it is based on the Unity engine), it is realistic enough that it WILL help you with real-life operation. For example, I sometimes use excavators in real life, and playing this game with two full-size joysticks helps me maintain and improve my dexterity. Also, it is not focused on simulating a single machine, but rather a broad range of them.  But simulation is not the core of this game. Having fun building, driving, operating machines is what it's about, especially in multi-player sessions, which are where the game shines. Some players have complained that there is too much driving, too much delivery. These people obviously have never observed a real-life construction site. It's all about delivering materials when needed and setting them in place with machines. That is what the game does. Running around hammering nails would make a very boring game.  ",

This game is by no means a serious game, but if you walk into it with an open mind and a good friend and don't take the game seriously you are in for hours of laughter. At one point while excavating my friend walked on the tracks and sent the machine flying thorugh the air. Don't expect miracles of the physiscs engine.  Also, after reading through some of the negative reviews here I have to say the controls are easy to use (on KB&amp;M) within 5 minutes of operating the excavator it became my job in all missions as no one else could use it.  My recommendation? If you are planning on playing this solo, be prepared for a lot of time driving over town for materials. Pick it up on sale, play it with some friends and enjoy this game in all its buggy glory",

The physics are great in some aspects and others not so great. Driving is a nightmare if you drive too fast but once you get used to driving it isn't quite as bad. As far as the controls for the excavator, boom truck and crane I have to say they are very realistic. I used to be in construction so I have plenty of experience with and excavator and limited with a crane but I have been driving a boom truck for the past 8 years and I will say it is as close to realistic as you will get. The missions do get a little repetative like some of the other posters stated, drive here and get this, then take it to site, dig a hole and clear the site. Job Well Done. I'm certain they will add more features later and I have only been playing for 6 hours so there may still be more to come.  All in all I do recommend this game and it is worth the price if you want to play it bad enough, if you can wait for a price drop then do so, if not buy it and have fun.",

            "review_text": "With the myriad of 'simulators' coming out of small European game developers, and the number of those that are actually 'buggy, furstrating and demanding a refund simulators', you'd be excused for being cautious about this latest simulator. However, this game - despite it's rough edges (which are actually being address by the developers) - is actually among the better one's I've viewed and/or bought.  I buy these sorts of games because I like the business sim/management side of things and my two sons enjoy watching the machines at work. The models are very good, the physics engine works as you'd expect - unsecured loads drift around the tray at speed, cabins bounce etc. The controls don't really feel intuitive to begin with, but after a few contracts you're relying less and less on the 'HELP' menu.  I'll admit that it can get a bit repetitive, i.e. 'Go to site with this equipment', 'Go to outlet, get these supplies, bring to site', 'Prepare site' etc. but isn't that how every contruction job basically goes anyway? Rock up, figure out what equipment and supplies you'll need, bring them to the site and commence work? And when you're done, clean it all up? At least from my obersvations of construction sites around my area - couple buildings but mostly road works. So while it does feel like groundhog day, it's really part and parcel with any real-life construction job.  I haven't tested multiplayer and I don't expect to - I doubt any of my friends would enjoy this kind of thing: as I said, I mainly bought this game for my two sons to watch me play to keep them out of mum's hair for an hour or so.  From a business-sim perspective, for me it's both good and bad. Contracts seem 'reaonsably priced', you're getting 5 figure contracts pretty much straight away - basically it's not a constant grind to get the more lucartive contracts. Unless I somehow have it on 'Easy' difficulty...I should check that... Regardless, there are many contracts and many of them pay well. The downside is that hiring personnel is level-based, so you can't hire workers right away and go nuts taking contracts to build your business or potentially go bust and have to fire everyone... You're almost certain to NOT fail the way it's set up. That could be seen as a good thing, but to me there's not a whole lot of risk...at least not so far.  I'm nearly three hours in and the only bug I've noticed was on completion of a job and when the fence to the property was reapplied to the map, my several ton small excavator nearly went into orbit. Aside from that one instance, I've not had any other problems.  People complaining they can't load vehicles on trailers or drive vehicles (unless it is an actual bug) just need to calm down, bring up the 'HELP' menu (the '?') and look at the controls for their vehicle or trailer. Some functions, like securing loads, only occurs from outside the vehicle - you can't do it from the cab, just like real life. The controls can be 'dumbed down', I was playing it with realistic controls however I have since switched to arcade style controls as I use a keyboard and mouse.  This game is obviously not everyone's cup of tea, so to speak, however if you are into running your own business and going from small time outfit to large scale construction magnate as well as 'getting on the tools', then this game is pretty solid so far. If my friends were into this sort of game, I'd recommend it to them and I'm not mad I bought this game either so as far as sales pitches go - if you're into this sort of thing, it's worth the US$26.99 I paid. If you're expecting to bring down the town in a giant excavator rampage or run through the city COD style insta-killing everyone with a shovel or jackhammer I'd give it a miss: this is a construction simulator, not a 'lunatic goes nuts in an excavator, with a shovel or a jackhammer' simulator.",

            "review_text": "Overall one the best releases from Astragon to date. The multiple PATCHES FIXED MANY THINGS IN THE GAME. I have played quite a few of their releases for sure, but this is not just another &amp;%#% 'simulator'. They did a good job in this niche genre.  The overall play has been built up for MANY years of simulations they have developed. Game play concept for a full construction company running is solid and works very well, including the finances, resources, vehicles, and supplies. Late game it becomes equally important to manage your finances rather than just your work load.  Controls for all vehicles are EXTREMELY TIGHT (with an Xbox 360 controller), and the help tool tips for new players is very useful. Locking down loads is importantly for driving, due to 'odd physics'. If you are playing the game on simulation controls, inertia and momentum make a BIG difference. Vehicle selection is excellent, although most machines are recycles from previous releases with graphic and control tuning. Graphics are perfectly acceptable for the game and reasonably detailed, but not overly optimized with the code engine. If you are at the highest graphical setting you are going to get some lag, unless you have a solid game system, especially if you want to run this game ABOVE 1080p. If you are looking for Crysis 3 type graphics this is not that type of game with perfect shadows, shading, smoke effects, etc. Physics has always been little 'wonky' with these type of games, including some pretty funny moments with rag doll physics, flying cars, dirt realism, and lack of proper damage modeling, in that respect this is NOT a simulation in this area.  Keep in mind, this not a game for everyone though. It is closer to a 'real' simulation than pure light-hearted fun, although the time required for projects is much shorter than it would be in REAL life, but can still be quite painful at times if you complete them alone. A good example of some of the more complicated missions may take OVER 3 hours to complete, but THANK GOD the game auto-saves, and you can leave and pick up where you left off. There is no 'time crunch'. There are even some 'shortcuts' the game gives you if you are really tired of digging or concrete pump work. Fortunately, you can hire workers, but its too bad you cannot interact with them and join the work like some other games of the genre. Its not a REAL simulation however as time scale is fast, and controls are still simplified for non-equipment operators. However, you are going to have to put in a few hours to get good with the controls and be proficient anyway. For example: The Concrete Pump Truck, has 8 sets of controls to have to use simultaneously, but the design makes is fairly straightforward to understand with minimal fuss. For some people, this game is going to seem like a LOT of work.  However, it is a great game for more than one player as you can multitask, and have it count towards your construction company progress. THAT IS FUN.  Recommended if you like building construction projects and running heavy equipment. If you think simulations games are 'work', you will not like it. Still working towards that $10 million in the bank (although it is 'fake' money). Construction is ALWAYS hard work!",

My overall rating on the game is 8.5/10. I recomend waiting atlest 3 second before you do anything after the game has loaded anything, it may prevent it from crashing as frequently. Also, if the game if crashing frequently, just tone down the graphix one notch. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do and don't wish you haven't bought it!

If you enjoy Euro Truck Simulator 2 mainly because it's relaxing, you''ll probably find this game relaxing too.   I just had my first CO-OP experience and I really loved it! Working on the save job, both in different vehicles is really cool. I also love that you can leave your vehicle and just walk. Pretty immersive.  The reviews about bad controls are not true. I think they are pretty perfect this way. Couldn't think of a better control scheme. And you absolutely don't need a controller like another reviewer said. I have no idea what that person played, not this game, that's for sure.. lol.   If you want a relaxing simulator, grab this one.

I wouldn't pay full price for it, but having got the Gold Edition for £10 I definitely don't feel cheated out of my cash.  TL;DR - If you like Farming Sim 2015 and this is on sale grab it, otherwise it's probably not for you.  The controls can be a little fiddly, but this game markets itself as a simulator, controls of vehicles like this ARE fiddly and the onscreen help guides are very useful in reminding you what does what.  Graphically it's not exactly ground breaking, but this does mean it'll run pretty well on older hardware.  The missions can be a little repetative, but then, this is a contruction sim, what do you think working on a building site is like? Oddly enough, quite repetative!

            "review_text": "I really want to be able to give this a good review but sadly there are a couple of issues that constantly prevent me having much fun at all with it, despite numerous revisits to try and get things working.  First up, the controls. If you're only ever going to try playing this with kb/mouse this will be less of an issue, albeit still a moderate one, but that in turn means you have to put up with operating machinery being rather janky. Really this is a game that cries out to be largely played with a controller (doing so entirely isn't an option as parts of the ui simply do not work properly with a controller), the twin analog sticks work perfectly in place of the 2 sticks used in excavators and in general driving and operating any equipement controls is better with analog controls. Sadly doing so is a nightmare, first up you lose all camera control once you get into a vehicle unless you keep swapping one hand between controller and mouse every time you want to reposition the camera slightly, which just adds to the already annying camera that comes with additional pointless 'Action Cam' modes you have to keep toggling past to get between the useful cab/free camera options. If you want to customise the controls the option is there, but it's a confusing mess. In some screens the correct xbox controller buttons are shown, in the keybindings menu they are not, instead you get the generic 'controllerbutton6' or whatever. The game supports using buttons as modifiers, then doesn't let you assign your own multi-input preferences. To top it off the ingame help for the controls that you can bring up often stretchs off the top and bottom of the screen, because you wouldn't want to see all of it now would you?  My other major gripe is with the physics, which vary from being fine, to annoying, to vehicles being launched into the air doing flips. Seriously, how can someone get it so wrong these days that vehicles slide sideways downhill, while on a paved road? If the game took place entirely in the depths of winter it would work as an ice driving experience, but it doesn't so it's stupid, especially so as it can lead to getting vehicles wedged onto scenery as you slide down hill.  The physics and camera/control issues are a real shame, this isn't far off being a awesome game if you're into the whole &lt;thing&gt; Sim genre, if a sequel comes along that addresses those issues it needn't do a huge amount else different, from what I've seen fighting past the controls there's a solid foundation present here that just needs that bit more polish to make the whole experience a little less like fighting your way uphill through treacle to get to the fun.",

Though you dont get to do some of the construction yourself, you get to use alot of the construction equipment found in real life. So far im about 34 hours into the game and I still enjoy playing it. So if your looking for a good simulation game or just have some extra money lying around, you should definatly download this game and get the gold edition. Makes this game even better for the simulation lover.  Thanks for reading and let WSI wish you a positive future.  -WhiteStoneIndustries-",

Don't get me wrong, this is a nice game, but it only works if you have an XBOX controller.  -------------------------- PROS:   + Good range of vehicles, from small trucks to huge cranes + DLC's aren't expensive and adds some nice vehicles + Missions are ok.  + Aside from the regular missions, you will have the chance to get special ones. + You can see your little company grow up by buying more places to store your vehicles. + The level system isn't grindy. + Multiplayer! + Support Steam Workshop (which means more vehicles and stuff) + You can employ NPCs to do the hard job for you, if you want (but you can't see them working)  CONS:  - It seems this game was not designed for PC. The mouse and keyboard controls are awful. If you think the machines controls are like farming simulator, you are wrong!  - The camera. OMFG, THE CAMERA CONTROL SUCKS! You can't control the camera on the xbox controller, you have to do it on the mouse, because who the hell knows why? Why can't this game have a nice camera control like every other game out there?  - If you are playing on mouse and keyboard, you will have to keep pressing the right mouse button to turn the camera around. This sucks!  - There are a few bugs. Not a big deal, but it's annoying as ♥♥♥♥ (the truck with the crane, for example. Sometimes the crane stuck on the truck itself and dont move).  - You dont get to build anything. All you do is place things with the crane, dig holes with an excavator, and transport stuff from A to B. But it's quite fun.  ----------------------  So basically is this. If you have an XBOX controller, go ahead, it'll be fun! But if you dont, you better buy one before you get this game :)",

Controls, while seeming a little daunting at first, you'll soon work out what does what and doesn't stray too far with each different machine you use so it becomes ingrained rather quick.
