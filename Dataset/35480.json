            "review_text": "Dwarfs!? is a top down casual strategy game where you loosely control dwarves as they tunnel for riches. I played this game for about 2 hours and put it down as I was not particularly compelled to continue. The game isn't terrible; there are certainly far worse out there but the gameplay is just 'OK' to the point where it's not worth playing in my opinion. There are several gamemodes but the main gamemode is called 'Arcade Mode' where you essentially go as long as you can for a high score. This game would be good as a tablet/phone game that I would play on the subway but as a PC game I need more of a reason to play this. Priced at $10, this game is far too expensive for what you get.   Score: 5/10",

Gets even more interesting on higher difficulties because of more new enemies like Spider Queen and caves with treasures/minerals. And the price is low, totally worth it. Also the other reason to get it is for the Killing Floor to unock Dwarfs?! weapons, they are quite powerfull. EDIT: Before doing stuff in arcade mode, i recommend you to pass the tutorial in the campaign mode, every feature and mechanics of the game will be described there, so you can return already armed and dangerous.",

If you like action puzzlers like flight control, droplitz, devil dice, bombastic and miner disturbance you will love this game. Dwarfs!? is nothing like dwarf fortress, the best way i can think to describe is a mixture of flight control and lemmings. Iv had allot of fun competing to positions in the high score board and i know i will continue playing for a long time to come.    The carnival event is the weakest part of the game, it was added a free dlc back before dwarfs was 'f2p', its just a pointless little addition, completely disjointed from the main game (which i consider arcade mode to be the main game) The campaign made serves as a good tutorial but definitely isn't long enough to be a selling point. I had fun with it but its only 10 minutes long. The base defense mode is playable for a an hour or so but is very bare bone, if you have already bought the whole game it can be a bit of fun but i would not recommend buying it separately.    Iv found most of the fun or this game to be chasing a high score in arcade mode, its mostly free of hacked and glitched high scores which is great. There is a few scores at the top which are over 50,000,000 which i obviously glitched or hacked but i can attest that the rest are legit including all of mine where i can be found in the top 10 of most game modes.",

(This version is the full game; the F2P version allows you to buy individual parts of the game.)]  Dwarfs!? is a strangely addicting game. If you enjoy arcade games, where the main objective is to beat your high score (or someone else's high score), you'll probably love this game.  The way you score is by getting as much gold as you can, while trying to stay alive--but you're dwarfs aren't the brightest and will insist on digging into caves filled with water, lava, and monsters, so you'll have to keep a close eye on them, which becomes harder and harder as the game progresses.  The game has four difficulties which can be played in 5, 15, 30, and 60 min sessions (but beware, you cannot save the game mid-session).  The only problem I've encountered is in long games, where you have thousands of dwarfs in the field at one time, my computer starts to lag--which makes the game very difficult and frustrating to play.  Overall, this is a fun, simple, casual game that can keep you entertained for hours or opened for a quick 5-minute session.",

You are better off buying 4 dollars of cocaine and consuming it through your ear canal while engaging in violent non-consensual homosexual intercourse. At the end of the day, it does not matter which position you are in because I can guarantee that the visual experience that is 'Dwarfs!?' (appropriately punctuated, I would imagine that the reader is getting anally penetrated while reading the word) is much less pleasing than either of them. I can not possibly express to you the level of masochism required to participate in this visual experience, however the dwarves' constant desire to become engulfed and drown in several common terrestrial liquids should give you at least a hint. Your warriors exhibit extremely debilitating cases of both autism and arthritis, failing to destroy even the most unthreatening shaman. Even telling your dwarves to move or not commit suicide costs massive amounts of currency. You literally have to place explosives and force them to blow themselves into smithereens to prevent them from destroying your own barriers and transforming your entire base into a pile of volcanic mush. Yes, this is an actual game mechanic. If you are still at all interested in this experience, I might also ask if you are interested in the evisceration of your internal organs by your worst enemy after a bad day at work. You will experience approximately the same amount of pain either way, but Dwarfs!? will also cost you 4 dollars. Unless of course you desire the free to play version in which you will also experience internal devastation, but as a filthy casual plebeian.",
