            "review_text": "On My Own: ~~~~~~~~~~   Nature can be so beautiful, majestic and peaceful. However, when you are by yourself and need to survive in it, nature can be tough on anyone. And you will be on your own!  On My Own is an adventure / survival game in a pixel world type of graphics. At the start of the game you will be able to choose if you would like to be a female or a male survivor stuck in the middle of nowhere. Upon choosing your gender, you will start the game in the beautiful and hot season of summer. Plenty of fruits and flowers are available for the picking in this season and you should take advantage of it. Starting in the summer is great but you will need to get through the next summer without dying, which could be a slight challenge shall we say.   The game is set in seasons and each season has turns: summer has four turns, fall has two, winter has four and spring has two. This game is all about your resources via hunting animals and picking picking fruits. No Zombies or other baddies to kill in this game.  You will find boxes here and there; make sure you actually look in them as they have valuable information on how to craft new items.  You will use W,A,S,D to move your character and the mouse to pick up or use items. Good Pixel artwork.  Positives: ~~~~~~~~   - Good pixel artwork - Interesting survival game without Zombies - Achievements  Negatives: ~~~~~~~~   - Not much action  On My Own is a nice survival type of game based on accumulating resources.  7/10  Key provided by developer/publisher for review purposes.

            "review_text": "This game is fun and super easy to play if you have ever used a keyboard and mouse before. I love the classic feel, very reminiscent of the original Legend of Zelda on NES. Its not as big a game (content wise) as I was hoping, but there are a few fun surprises if you explore the seemingly limitless open world in each of the four different biome campsites.  The challenge is to scavenge, hunt, craft and plan out your journey, with some quotes, music, and a few little easter eggs along the way. If you learn to acquire food quickly, you can explore and focus on filling your journal. Travel wisely so that you dont starve, freeze, or get eaten by a bear.",

Let us support the developer :) At the moment the game for me: 7/10. ---- •Я думаю у этой игры хорошое будущие, так как задумка интересная, но на данный момент она далека от хоршей игры. Давайте поддержим разработчиков :) На данный момент игра для меня: 7/10.",

Ambients are very repetitive. Crafts are poorly varied. Hunting are very simple, almost like a math.  Bottom line, it's not worth of playing, unfortunately. It can still be a good game, but it needs improvements.",
