            "review_text": "Projectiles from off-camera behind you make this game quite frustrating, no matter how good your reflexes, if you can't see the bullet, you can't dodge it.  The game is not bad, but always having one eye on the radar and off the action to avoid surprise instant damage seems out of place for a fast paced bullet-hell shooter. Maybe some sort of warrning system that lets you know when an enemy behind you starts shooting, anything other than having to constantly look at the radar litterally every second.",

Go play Xevious, far better way to spend your time. &lt;/edit&gt;  People claim this game is hard, I've yet to run into that. Then again, I've only made it to level 2, which has thus far been impossible due to essential ships flying through walls where they become invincible. Might just be me, might not be.  Thrice now I've been unkindly hindered by heavy fighters flying through walls and getting stuck on the wrong side of a barrier.  Them pandas... so sad. If you still plan on playing this game, which is not a terrible choice, bring a controller. The support is instant and is by far and away the best control scheme.",

Aircraft spawn to the sides and rear of you giving no time to dodge it, the number that do show up is not countable. They could have had a hanger to stop or slow the spawn rate on air craft but they dont. The good part, they have a single shots from them but the speed they fly and the shot speed are the same, you can see them flying with there shots right in front. The ground based tanks the AA guns are better balanced then what you face in the air, when you kill an area its empty after.  I think they got he weapons swaped, guns would have been better for ground based and a little tracking on missles for anit-air, having to lead your target at a 90deg turn just to shoot aircraft makes it look bad. The limited ammo for big attacks has you wishing for more as this would have made the run and gun game play fun.  Not recommened at this time needs work.",
