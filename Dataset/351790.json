Yes, it's a visual novel, you have about 3 branching points that don't change the story much (it either ends quickly or progresses onto the same timeline quickly), it is set in a cyberpunk future, and the art and writing is decent but not outstanding. It feels more like the start of a novel than a short story, but even for that the characters and the world lack that certain something to draw me in and keep me wanting more. That said, generally the world building, the plot and the characters and their interplay are solidly done, so with more practice or the right editor, the writer could easily move up from 'decent' to 'good'. Pretty much the same goes for the art, it is decent, and 'free VN' cheaply made, and judging from observing webcomic artists develop, give the artist a few more years to hone and develop their style, they could easily move up from 'decent' to 'good'.  Despite the aforementioned weaknesses, I did enjoy playing this VN. It's free! Recommended.",

            "review_text": "I was interested to play this game after noticing the newest game to the series just came out. So i thought before i spend money on it, i'll play the first game so i know what is going on and with all the positive reviews, i thought this was going to be a good series i could fall inlove with. And it just so happens to be free. But even if its a free game to play, it doesn't make it a good game. As you can see, this is a visual novel which has choices you can make. But the choices in this game are dead end choices where you must pick the right one to continue onward. That was a huge disappointment to me because i kept picking the ones that got me caught. Linear novels with no tweaks for pick your own path really bother me because i felt duped in a way. And for whatever reason the 'quicksave' button would not let me save at my current point. So i had to start from the very beginning which was frustrating till i found out if you go into the menu and hit 'Save' it will work. When you make a visual novel, you want the reader to fall inlove with the plot, the characters and to pull them in. But i was somewhat lost by this novel. When you first start, the game puts you right in the middle of something that you won't understand and does not explain very well later on. And right off the bat you can tell this game felt rushed a bit or was mainly just a project to see if someone could actually make a visual novel. However, even if the art style and charming music were a nice touch which are positive things to note, the scene's did not flow well at all and made you felt like the developers didn't care if the dialog flew from one end of the town to a apartment or a rooftop without warning. I just couldn't understand it. The writing isn't good either but i kept playing it because i really want in my heart to like this so i can try out the 2nd game. So i pushed on, in hopes it would get better. But after reading more of the story, the main character Bunny started to make me mad. It was hard to tell that she was talking to the AI 'Mask' and not at the other character she was interacting with in the physical world. But it wasn't just that, it was her personality as well. She seemed to act like a child, not a skilled hacker. I just resented the character even further than i did in the beginning. And also what i noticed is how this novel lacks any descriptive details about the places bunny travels too. *Shes in a park* Well what did the park look like? *shes in a hospital* Well, can we get some more details please instead of bunny constantly talking? I love visual novels so much when the story comes to life, but i cannot recommend this to any of my friends and advise you to look elsewhere. But hey at least this game was free so no one had to waste anything but their time.",

There could be more dialogue to help the plot along, to make things more clear, but it probably just got lost in translation.

The emotions and thoughts of the main character are nicely shown, it makes you feel her and pretty much like her from start.  I recommend this mostly If you like cyberpunk.  Art is great, even if you play this just for that, is worth it.  Music could have been better I'd like it to fit more the future style but as a general music for a novel is good and emotional.

Though, you will know who will fill what role rather quickly upon reading each characters text, so, it's not bad considering it's such a short game. This has so much potential to evolve into one of the best Visual Novels 'out there'.   THE MUSIC IS AMAZING!  PROS- Fairly decent visuals. Enough plot to let you know what's going on. Several points of intereaction, where you make the choice to advance the plot. HUGE ONE here. The music is incredible, and it fits a cyber punk theme perfectly. ( Seriosuly, after a playthough, go back and just listen to the music)  CONS- Too short. Story is fairly common for Cyber Punk. Characters follow common tropes. No suprise twists. Visuals are a bit static, but hey, you're supposed to be reading anyway. ;) You will feel like it is unfinished at the end.  Side note; this game reminds me of Neo Seoul in that movie Cloud Atlas.  I give this game an 8/10. Play it.",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game. It's not for the story, which I didn't get far enough into to actually get to, It's also not because 'the gameplay is good' (it's not) It's finally not because of the story, which definately has potential, but started basically when the game finished. It's actually because this is an interesting example of how NOT to make a visual novel, without being necessarily bad.   (warning: contains very mild spoilers)  This visual novel is a great learning experience for starting visual novel creators as it's not 'just' a rough gem', it's an extremely rough gem with very fundamental flaws.  The game runs on a custom engine made for iOS and poorly ported to windows, and it really shows. There is literally only one hotkey and that's the spacebar for 'next line'. Every other function is a button either on screen or in the menu (which is also a seperate button). On iOS this makes sense since tabbing the screen at any place other than a button can only have one function.   Another result of this is that many functions are cut. There are no options for sound management (which isn't that much of an issue since the only sound is background music, making your line-out the only sound management you actually need), different screen sizes, text speed, font size, skip options, or jiggle physics (which is sliiiightly less important than the other options missing). It's all cut down to the bare minimum of 'play, save and load'.  It COULD work, but it doesn't here. The background is usually very light, but they use non-bordered white letters for this visual novel. The black bar that the text was displayed on, was, in combination with what I mentioned last line, not enough to actually make it readable at the speed I desired to read it at. This could be fixed in either one of two ways: give the translucid bar a higher opacity or an opacity slider in the options, or make the text borded by a small 2px black line.  Another thing, that's a clear relic of the iOS days, is that the buttons feel extremely unresponsive. This is, simply, because there is no feedback at all. I imagine that on iOS, the phone would vibrate a bit, and that visual aids aren't needed since you don't see the button anyway when your finger is in front of it, but on windows I can never tell whether or not I quicksaved.  The biggest flaw is the lack of history. In most visual novels, you can either press a button or scroll up to see some of the past dialogue, but in this game, that's not possible. Since it's a sci-fi game and not some romantic comedy, you sometimes really want this function when something in the next line refers to something you accidently read over in the previous line.   What to learn from it: 1. get, besides a load and save option, at least a way to customize some of the game, be it by resolution changes or some extra slider bars in an option menu 2. make sure that there's an option to read older dialogue 3. make buttons responsive/when you port an engine, optimise it well for the new platform.   And now to the writing: It's not bad. It started off just as atrocious as the interface, but 10 minutes in, I noticed how most annoyances were simply no longer there in the storytelling. The game starts off extremely fanfictiony, with *'s for action, rather than for ambience. The good way to use *: 'it's getting late *sigh* I'm going to bed' the bad way to use *: 'It's getting late *she sights* I'm going to bed' In the beginning, you're not sure what's going on until they actually go to the city where the invisible appartment actually is. It's not 'mysterious', it's just written messy. Finally, the big words used during stages of rest (when the player should relax as well) made it feel unimmersive and pretentious.  This was over time fixed after 20 minutes. The only problems I have now are that Bunny is an extreme whiner who talks extremely cheesy. This *could* work, if it wasn't for mask being awkward and for the spelling and grammatical errors.  Another flaw in the writing is the huge amount of sudden unannounced skips in the story with the only possible explanation being that she's narcoleptic.  What to learn from this: 1. do your research before you make your first VN. Look at how everything is used. Then, out of that, create your own style 2. when you come from a different medium, don't try to mix it in right off the bat (kind of overlaps with 1) 3. let someone playtest this before you put it up on greenlight. Ask him too look at more than just the story (which is, reading in the comments, basically the only thing this game is praised for).  And now the story: The story itself it a bit too short to actually review here, but there are certain aspects that I can review.  Without spoiling anything: for a first episode of an episodic visual novel, the story cut off at a good place. It's right at the start of something new that we'll see a next time. The story definately has potential. The longer I played it, the more I wanted to know about what happened. So far, it was predictable, but not in a bad way since it just followed natural progression instead of something forced. There are two things that I do have some critique for: 1. the choices you're given don't mean anything. I know you're only at the beginning of the game, but if there is only once choice that doesn't get a forced bad end, don't give them! The first choice, where two of the three branches are obvious dead ends, is a common thing in doujin soft/indie visual novels, but there are still too many choices where the other choice simply means instant death. Choices that in the end don't matter, but do matter for your sense of freedom in the moment (like when you find the woman in the hospital, and someone comes towards you), are fine, and, this early into the story, they're even good. The story branched off for just long enough to actually feel like it mattered. 2. You know way too much of the enemy already. You know, out of nowhere, his face, name and background, while none of this is actually necessary. The mystery stops when the evil has a face. it's a shame that they did that already. The encounter was fine, and Klement (I like this name for a bad guy) having a name is also fine, but the actual enemy should have just been a shadow.   This next one is just my opinion as an AI student, but mask seems 'too human for how stupid he is' and the other way around. It requires immense hardware to run a program that can interact with humans, let alone act human, while storing data and logical thinking are relatively extremely easy to pull off. I think that a better way of phrasing it is 'mask's mistakes are way too human for an AI'. Of course you can program AI to make mistakes like that, but that would be extremely counterefficient for a personal computer.  Now to the music: The music itself is pretty decent, but still has clear mistakes. The part where she's at the hospital sounded loud, drone and repetitive (because it was a 8 second loop that wasn't even well looped). 'Drone' is a word that comes to mind in many of the songs, and it's the only complaint I have, for example, about my personal favorite track in the game, which is the one with the guitar, harp and (drone) strings. Music with lyrics is fine, but it's a lot harder to make this work this work as background music in visual novels. At first I applauded this attempt, but I soon noticed that this track is played for a rather long time, making it loop just a bit too much.  Finally: none of the songs actually loop well.  What to learn from this: 1. mix your music right. If the rhythm is too loud, it could sound drone, but if the lead is too loud (doesn't happen in this game, however), the song could fall flat. 2. Make the songs about 3 minutes, or at least 30 seconds, but well loopable.  Reached character limit. read this pastebin for the art and conclusion: zAEyuL6V",

Sprites suffer from a lack of transitions, the default, boring textbox makes it hard to read the text at times, and by the point I had to give up on this game, every major speaking character had the same color name, making it a chore to keep track of conversations. In a medium that focuses largely on dialogue, those are pretty huge mistakes.  Use of sound effects was sparse, while the music was generally lacking. The game opens with a public domain piece, and at one point there's a song that's literally five seconds long and badly looped over and over. Add to that what appears to be a complete lack of any kind of options screen or main menu, plus absolutely wooden writing that has about as much style and substance as a bowl of tapioca, and you have a recipe for... well, something that's just not any good.  It looks like this game was used as a springboard to gain interest (and funding) for future games by these developers, and while there's a good chance their other games are better than this one, I wouldn't pay to find out.
