            "review_text": "If you care about these type of games in even the slightest, this is a must purchase.  In what seems to be a common trend among people who are first exposed to this game, I was initially ready to dismiss it however many years ago before it initially arrived on Xbox 360, based on the seemingly underwhelming visuals and rudimentary looking gameplay.   Then, I played it, and it demonstrated how wrong I was about it.  I now consider it one of the best shmups to have come out in the modern era, and my favorite of that wave of 360 releases aside from G.Rev's Strania. Yes, it's a relevantly simple game on paper, unadorned by any of the complicated scoring trappings of your average CAVE shmup and it's contemporaries, or the elaborate weapon systems of more “traditional” shmups, but the beauty of this game lies in the execution. I like to think of it as a modern day Zanac (which is one of my favorite games of all time), where underneath the mediocre aesthetics and muted presentation, lies a game full of depth and complexity. A shmup that was crafted with such quality, it became one of the standout examples of excellence in the genre.  On top of that, much has already been said about the high quality of the soundtrack. Youskue Yasui, usually does good work, and I think this is still his hottest soundtrack to date. “Survive” in particular has been a regular jam of mine since it was first released.   Get this game.",

Includes 'Original' and 'Advanced' modes with multiple difficulties for both. Definitely worth picking up. Wonder pack includes JUDGEMENT SILVERSWORD, which is also neat as heck so go for it",

P.S: Awesome, i repeat, AWESOME OST!!! (Original &amp; Arrange)   A MUST BUY FOR ANY SHMUP PLAYER.",

            "review_text": "Eschatos may not LOOK good, but it is good in dozens of subtle, fundamental ways that even I cannot put into words. Fair, charming, expertly crafted, accessible when it needs to be yet brutal as well when needed, and with encounters designed almost perfectly to wordlessly teach you the score system.  I am not clever enough to really explain clearly why Eschatos is so good when you have so many other options on Steam. But it is. And you absolutely should play it, whether you are are shmup master or a shmup neophyte.",
