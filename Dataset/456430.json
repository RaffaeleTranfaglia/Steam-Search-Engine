            "review_text": "Basic hidden object game. Graphics are OK but not great. There are a few spelling errors and object description errors that are just an inconvenience. The puzzle element of the game is interlocking, so lots of things you get are used with other things that you get. The story line is extremely limited and acts only as a vehicle to advance the puzzles. All in all, it is worth it for the extremely low price.",

            "review_text": "A pretty basic Hidden Object game, a single playthrough to completion should net you all of the acheivements. While I've logged about 6 hours, easily 2-3 of that was idle, since I made a point of idling out the (surprisingly expensive!) cards before ever playing the game.  HO scenes are ok, never hard. Plotline is... um, well, you start off stranded at a candy house because your car turned into candy, and now three totally not-witch sisters want you to perform various totally reasonable tasks to get it running again. Tasks like finding a piece of mail (  it's in the mailbox  ); prying up their stairs (to find out what's hidden in there!); and taking apart clocks and other household devices (so you can build a magic panel that needs a gear one of them eventually gives you, so that you can find the lilac branch and grind it into powder by using a mortar &amp; pestle and combining it with a chocolate bunny and maple syrup, of course!).  The plot is fairly simple and striaightforward, and the 'hint' button pretty much always works if you're stuck, or just have a bad memory.  Creativity/how high on goofballs: 8/10 kaleidescopic range of color: 10/10 - it's a pretty game. would keep a kid busy/kid-safe game: 10/10 May help put an adult to sleep: 8/10   Ease of achievements: 10/10   - just takes some time  Endgame: For $1.99 it's not a bad buy, but knowing what it is now, I wouldn't pay that price again; wait for a sale (that is probably coming up soon for, you know.... Christams.",

Perfect for when you need something to relax or get into the right mood for Christmas (or you're like me and you can't get enough of Christmas). Definitely worth the price, a bargain when it's on sale. Oh and the soundtrack is beautiful. Very relaxing.  A few minor spelling errors, one of which caused me to be stuck for a bit because I couldn't figure out what the word was supposed to be, but there's a hint button so it's not a real problem. Just mentioning it for the sake of feedback.",

            "review_text": "I purchased this game because it was inexpensive and because it had a Christmas theme. While some of the objects were holiday-related, there wasn't really a holidy feel to this game at all.  It's a very short game at about 2 hours at most to complete. There are only 4 locations. Each one is fairly loaded with puzzles though. Some of the logic on where to put what items you find seemed off at times.   The story seemed very arbitrary, help a few women do some random stuff in exchange for a magical cure to fix your car.   There is either no music, or a single track from the Nutcracker on loop (that I can recall hearing). I don't remember much in audio in general.   I found a single typo. Once asked to find a 'dool' when it meant 'doll.'   It wasn't always easy to discern what all the objects were in each puzzle, but as a test, I started selecting items from the screen that somehow stood out from the base image and was able to find most of them without even reading the item list. So it's pretty obvious what the target items are. When you revisit a hidden object location, it's extra easy to find objects, because they are all new objects that weren't there the last time.   The hint tips are useful and there wasn't any limit on using them. However, it didn't always direct me to move to a different location when needed. If it didn't point to anything, I knew to visit the other three areas.   It's okay for $1.39 (the sale price I paid). I finished it. There are better games of this genre out there though.",

            "review_text": "Lovely graphics and very simple, perfect for young children. I enjoyed swaying in my chair to the music from the Nutcracker.   There were cases where a hidden object scene would freeze upon loading, showing only the scene but not the list of items to find. I had to quit the game and restart it to remedy this.  Overall though, very sweet and an enjoyable 90 minutes.",
