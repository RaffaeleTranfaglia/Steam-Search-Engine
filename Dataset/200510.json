            "review_text": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown is incredibly fun. I love turn based games and this takes strategy to the fullest. In this game it is man vs. alien and we are fighting back to remove the aliens. You control a squad of soldiers that you move and tell them who to attack, defend, or to do overwatch to attack moving enemies. There are four types of soldiers you can get randomly when they level up and each will gain rank and you choose from 1 or 2 abilities when they do. If your soldiers die you have a chance to save them by healing them before they die but if they die they are gone forever. You also have the build up your forces by researching technology and spending resources to buy new technologies, weapons, and buildings.  This is a highly addictive game which can be pretty difficult if you don't cheat (save often and reload over and over again to get the best results). An interesting thing about XCom is it saves its random number generator so that means if you load a game and do the same actions over again you will get the same results but if you do things in a different order you can get different results (the chances to hit will be the same but if one soldier is more likely to hit, he might hit an enemy when another would miss).  The only thing I didn't like about this game is it seems to be very short to finish one playthrough but you could always play again with a higher difficulty or it also comes with Second Wave which lets you chance certain settings in the game. I would highly recommend if you like turn based strategy games.",

            "review_text": "This is a fantastic strategy game with a couple minor flaws. Firstly, let me say that I love XCOM. I owned the original UFO Defense for PC and PlayStation, Terror from the Deep, and Apocalypse. I played many reboots including Afterlight and some community made versions as well. This game comes the closest to remaking the original and adds a few nice elements in its own right.  Ill list off the bad first. This game is RNG hell! Try this scenario. You’re down to your last move and have a half dead Muton waiting around the corner. You wisely saved your crit happy, shotgun toting, assault run and gun soldier. You confidently streak towards your adversary with only a slight degree of separation as you stop moving. You check your aim, breathe a sigh of relief at the 98% hit chance. You fire away only to find your Muton buddy laughing furiously as you miss. How did I miss at point blank distance with a shotgun!? Next turn my emboldened Muton friend slaughters my cross eyed soldier with one quick shot to the face. This in turn causes a nearby rookie to freak out and panic. He begins shooting my colonel in the back causing her to bleed out. From this point on in your life, 99% will never be a sure thing again.   Now here is the good. Excellent challenge. This game forces you to think ahead and plan accordingly. Do you think you mastered the game? Try classic or impossible difficulty with ironman enabled. And if that’s not enough try out the long war mod. Both tactical and base management layers offer enough strategy and replayability to keep anyone that likes strategy games entertained for at least two playthroughs. Now add all the alien lore discovered by engaging new aliens and base side research and development, and you have one engrossing experience.  Graphics and sound are fantastic. The game presents in an isometric top down orientation for the tactical aspect. In between turns you can sometimes hear the ominous movements of moving aliens or mortified screams from unsuspecting civilians. Environments are very detailed and there are enough unique maps to not see any repeats on a single play-through. Music is great, but still doesn’t beat the PlayStation soundtrack in my humble opinion.   I highly recommend that any person wanting to experience a great turn based strategy game pick up Enemy Unknown and at least the expansion Enemy Within. Despite the RNG issues, the game is a solid, well thought out attempt to make XCOM relevant again. Fraxis did this game some justice for both stalwart XCOM veterans and new players alike. XCOM 2 has already exceeded my expectations as well. I however think this game belongs in anyone’s collection. ",

            "review_text": "I have mixed feeling about XCOM. As a gamer who played games in early 90s allready and played the first XCOMs when those were brand new. After i played Enemy Unknown i had a feeling that this isnt what i expected.  I bought XCOM long time ago and i must say that i found the price of the DLC outrageous later, especially because it actually added what i expected to be in the base game. Since this experience i dont buy brand new games until they have expansions out and they have GOTY or complete packs available. I miss the 90s and early 2000s when internet not existed or was used only by the minority of the population, because game DEVelopers had only one chance to release their product so they released complete products. Nowadays none of the AAA games complete, if i play any of them i have empty feelings, i feel that something is missing, in sequels i have a feeling that 'omg this was in previous version, why not in this' ofc those coming with DLCs but this feeling ruins my entertainment.  In this case i missed that aliens dont invade my base and a few other things, dont missunderstand that, the game was ok, but when my first playthrough ended, i was like: 'ok, that was it? hmmmm am i rushed through or really that was it?'  Do i recommend the base game? yes, if you not played any original XCOM game, but if you dont own the game i suggest the complete pack with DLC (i still find it outrageous that complete pack cheaper than buying the DLC for those who bought the game before, i promised, because of this, that ill never buy DLC but suddenly i got it as gift).  Do i recommend the game with DLC? yes, its awesome, no emptyness feelings, the game got what should have been at release, this what we should have gotten for the price of an AAA game.  The game is pretty hard and challenging, i liked it, need to plan every movement of your units, i felt some classes are useless, i actually preferred only support and snipers for my crew because supports can explore area and avoid getting hit with ligthning reflexes while exploring and snipers can eliminate enemies from long and safe distance.  Base Game: 3/10 for me at least, its my opinion. Game with DLC: 10/10 original XCOM feeling, i wasnt able to stop while i played.  I encountered still a few BUG in the game but usually quiting game and reloading fixed those, so nothing serious.",

I tried Civ 5 first, but really couldn't get into it at all. So I am only now giving this game a fair chance. I literally said to my best friend that this was the last strategy game that I was going to play if I didn't like this one.  This game though...This game is great! I can't fault it so far. It sort of feels like a game of chess in a lot of ways. Nice graphics and art style too. Actually, the visuals and music remind me of Deus Ex, which is great. It sounds like the same composer to me.  There are also a lot of familiar voices, which is actually kind of distracting, because I am trying to figure out where I know the voice from and not concentrating on what they are saying...The council guy sounds like the narrator from Screenjunkies 'Honest Trailers' lol (It IS him!) :D  Haha, and I guessed the other one right too! It's the Dharma Initiative guy from LOST! :D  Ha! again! It is the Deus Ex Human Revolution composer too! :D  Anyway, the gameplay and strategy elements are very engaging. You need to plan your moves and take good advantage of cover while getting your squad into position. Then there are squad member promotions, weapons upgrades etc. which offer some interesting choices. The engineering and research aspects are very interesting too. You need to prioritise what to develop, research, build etc. At certain points you have to choose where to go and who to help, which causes panic levels to go up in the regions you don't help. So you have to manage panic levels too.  There is a lot going on here, a lot of re-playability, and very satisfying gameplay. I am finding it quite addictive so far and I am glad that I have finally found a strategy game that I like. This is definitely helped by the way the game is designed and the intuitive, easy to learn UI, which is a big reason why I haven't liked other strategy games that I have played.  So yeah, very cool game so far.",

            "review_text": "XCOM—Enemy Unknown is the best turn-based game about immigration. How should we treat the immigrants? Should we kill them?  Your immediate response may be: “We should not kill all the immigrants.” Understandable pity. But what if the immigrants are destroying our cities via their plasma weapons?   This game, XCOM: Enemy Unknown, answers that question; in such a case, we must create a multi-national, multi-gender special forces group with which to kill the disgusting invaders.  You see, in the game the aliens enter our atmosphere--UNINVITED--and start stealing our women and shooting our men. And for this reason, the commando organization is made--XCOM. XCOM’s elite soldiers fly to the gas stations and grocery stores and office buildings of our pure Earth, in their jet-version of the V-22 osprey, and shoot the aliens. It is..beautiful. Like Mozart.  I love how the game slows down whilst you see an alien take its final bullet, no longer able to withstand human fire. Do you know the film The Matrix? Of course you do. Imagine, though, that instead of Neo dodging bullets, it is outer space foreigners slowly getting torn to pieces by our Made on Earth bullets; the yellow, green blood spewing from the bodies.   Cross over the ozone layer without a valid passport now, alien! Oh! You can't? Why? Is it because you are dead?  But it doesn’t stop with bullets. XCOM eventually gives your troops laser and plasma weaponry, which replace your metal rounds. And they are worth it, so worth it. The laser and plasma are red, green, and bright. They make the killings like Christmas Eve at night. I actually get the shivers thinking about it. Mmmm, yes. I have..so many memories of the glow, bursting through immigrant bodies. I love to just...close my eyes, and conjure up memories from this game. They are so beautiful.  I almost forgot the explosives. Grenades and rockets fling the xenos’ bodies like rag dolls. Unfortunately, though, the game doesn’t slow down and focus the camera on their flying corpses.  You can also capture the aliens alive. Three times you HAVE to do this. I didn't like those parts.  If you decide to get this game, you should do so right before a vacation begins. I couldn’t stop..hunting after it began. ALSO, you should get the Enemy Within DLC with the base game. Doing so will let you turn your troops into large, mutilated, killer robots. They lose their humanity, yes, but that’s okay; it helps you kill aliens at a faster rate, and with greater force.  If XCOM’s aliens came in peace, then I guess it would be okay not to kill them all. But as the game shows, the aliens do not come in peace.   When the real aliens land on our planet and start taking away our jobs, we should follow XCOM's example.  9/10",

Now, first off, this is not Real-Time Strategy, this is Turn-Based Strategy, and the only previous experience I had with such titles was tabletop games, and Pokemon. So I gave it a shot.  The game is set during the begining of a war with extraterrestrial beings. You are made Commander of the Extraterrestrial Combat Unit, XCOM for short and lead a global effort to push back the invasion. With a Council overseeing you, and people being abducted every day, this is no easy task.  How do you stop the alien menace? The gameplay is mainly divided into two parts: all of the gameplay that happens at the base (i.e. sending air support, investigating alien technology, changing your soldiers' names and looks, promoting soldiers, choosing countries to support, and expanding your base) and the gameplay that takes place in the battlefield, with your international squad of customized elite soldiers (i.e. moving them, shooting at aliens, recovering resources, saving civilians caught in the cross-fire). Both parts are incredibly well done and very fun to play.  Now, when I say elite soldiers you might think this is easy, but make no mistake, this game is unforgiving, sometimes to ridiculous extents in higher difficulties. It should prove a challenge to beat the game even on Normal, as countries stop giving you their support and the world crumbles around you. And, as it is no longer common in most AAA games, death really does matter in this game. Do you have a Sniper Major who you spent hours costumizing, giving medals to, promoting and always saves your team? One lucky shot by the enemy and you have him no longer.   If you like intelligent, highly customizable, hard but enjoyable games this one is for you.   And don't even get me started on how good the DLC is.",

The aliens start out small, they're hardly a threat at all, Then they bring in the big ones, who can each weigh a ton, and your operatatives start to fall.  Your soldiers are all unique, so you get attached to them each. They go and fight together,  but they deaths are forever, so when that happens, it's bleak.  The missions are randomly generated, so they can't be anticipated. They can happen in a hurry,  but don't you go worry, they help your base get upgraded.

The way the story flowed seemed very logical, even-handed, and motivating. Working with the military, engineering, and scientific wings of XCOM was unique and interesting. Turning your band of merry warriors into legendary powerhouses, nicknames and all, was as anticipatory as unleashing them in the field.  The scathing difficulty, even on Easy, is apparent throughout; if you're gung-ho, your soldiers will die. Period. I liked that, having a challenge requiring tact and discretion.

            "review_text": " A Well Done Remake! [KAMGUSTA's REVIEW]   I had high hopes on this remake because I had some great times with the original classic trilogy. After playing it to the end I must say that most of my hopes have been satisfied. They took all that made great the previous chapters and included into this new game: the graphic is very nice, the combat system is turn based, you can expand your HQ by building new facilities, you can upgrade your weapons and technologies, you intercept and board alien spaceships, your team skills advance as they level up and you can stun and vivisect the aliens! What could you ask more?  Well, to be honest there are a couple of things I would liked to be addressed: the enemies spawn 'magically' and adopt not so clever strategies; it is too easy to overpower your team with flying suits, plasma cannons and psy powers; you can only build 1 HQ and team members have their nationality random choosen (the last one is not a great deal, but won't you trust more a male american assault team than a female indian one...?).  The things that really ruined my happiness are the ending coming after an average of 30 hours and not even a single HQ defense mission. Sadly the replay value is also quite low even if there are different levels of difficulty (there are no incentives in finishing the game twice if you fully completed the first run as I did). I guess this also means the Enemy Within DLC is a must buy.   Best played with Keyboard and Mouse Recommended Buy Price &lt; 25$ Score 8/10 ",

            "review_text": "In XCOM: Enemy Unknown players are tasked with running a military base who's sole purpose is to defend the Earth from alien attacks. The base view is presented in an ant farm style, which allows you to explore the structure of your base as though it is a living system. Unfortunately in this iteration of XCOM satellite uplinks/nexus are so vital to your success (especially on harder difficulties) that you are forced into a fairly standard base makeup. If you don't focus on getting your satellites up, you will almost certainly lose.  The main focus of the game is the battles, which on the whole are interesting and tense. Cover is vital during tactical battles, and if you do not use appropriate cover on harder difficulties you will quickly lose your valuable soldiers as often times taking one hit means death. Forcing yourself to use Iron Man difficulty or otherwise not reloading your saves is almost certainly the most interesting to play the game and means that losing a soldier is permanent. But it's this chance of permanent loss that brings so much tension and excitement to the battles. There is nothing like the joy of nailing an alien on a 25% chance shot and save a squad member's life, or the sting that comes from missing a 97% shot you thought for sure was in the bag. Soldiers rank up from battles and learn more and more abilities as they do. Successfully completing missions and killing aliens you can recover their technology in order to research it and further improve your soldiers. The visual upgrades your soldiers get from new equipment is probably one of the most appealing aspects of the game. Seeing a loved soldier move up from standard gear to become a future soldier with glowing guns and sleek armor is fantastic.  Unfortunately in the battles the AI opponents do not follow the same rules as the player units until they are 'activated' by coming into field of view of your soldiers. Until they activate they are essentailly one 'unit' and will teleport around the battlefield (outside of your view usually) into positions of varying believability. For instance one time I cleared a building by killing all the sectoids within, and then my soliders heard a sound coming from the neighbouring building. As I stacked my soldiers up on the doors and prepared to breach the building they suddenly heard sounds behind them. I sent them back to the first building only to find more sectoids had teleported onto the ones that I just killed, and were no longer in the building my soldiers heard them in only two turns ago. Another case of this is when my rookie soldiers began to panic and hunker down, I once had a group of sectoids teleport in the middle of my soliders! They quickly took cover on every side of my soldiers and were flanking from so many angles that there was no chance success at all.   Another way in which the game 'cheats' is during some missions (usually 'council' missions like escorting VIPs or defusing bombs) aliens will simply drop in from the sky. They'll either drop in out of view, behind you, in perfect sniping positions, at your flank, at all of your flanks... in other words, pretty much anywhere. There is a pattern to when they drop in, but there is no warning, or rather the warning comes as they are dropping on top of you which kind of renders it useless.  While there are certainly some problems and questionable decisions in this reboot, overall it is a very worthy successor to the original. XCOM: Enemy Unknown kind of screws up the base building by railroading you into satellite focus, and the tactical battles by cheating the rules your soldiers are forced to follow. On the other hand they enhance the experience by allowing your soldiers to learn interesting abilities when they rank up, including some interesting equipment and enemy types, and just making the game much shinier and easier to play.  Overall it is clearly one of the most solid strategy games on Steam despite it's flaws. It is one of my favourites in my collection and I'm sure that will only be reinforced by Enemy Within.",

It took ages, but oh, was it WORTH IT. I'm in love with this game. I really am. Would I want to marry this game if given the opportunity? YES. I just love it.   The game is fast paced, even for a strategy game, and danger lurks every corner. XCOM just says 'Alright, hope you enjoyed the tutorial. Now we'e going to load you with insanely difficult missions where your squadmates might permanently die. Oh, you saved the wrong city? Too late. Game over.' That is XCOM's difficulty summed up. Is this a good thing? Yes. I don't want games that 'Oh, let me show you how to destroy all the aliens' and 'Oh, silly, this whole game is a tutorial!' They waste my time. Recently, I've been thinking about comparing this game to Civilization V, another extremely popular turn-based strategy game. I cannot give my opinion on it yet, but I will.   The graphics are fine, no issues with it. It keeps a cartoony feel and doesn't go too far into realism. It seems a bit bright in this kind of atmosphere, but it gets the job done.   I like the songs, and they match the game pretty well. Not the greatest soundtrack, but still impressive.   Overall, XCOM is an extremely good game, but there is one major downside to this game: BUGS. The game crashes here and there, and it is loaded with bugs. I have issues in combat where the screen is focused only on a corner and nothing else. It gets really annoying pretty quick. One other issue I found is that sometimes when you're at your base, you're stuck there. Seriously. It freezes up. I can't think straight due to how great this game is, with the base building, the great replayabilty, awesome gameplay, and lots more. If this game had no bugs, it would be perfect.   I would definitely recommend this game. Aside from a couple of issues, XCOM is a great reboot to an amazing series. With it's strong replayability and awesome turn based combat, Enemy Unknown shows to be one of the finest games of 2012.

In my first playthrough I played on normal and got a grip of how the game works but once you got a hold of what you were doing it was quite easy I thought. When I finished the game I tried the classic difficulty which really pushed my strategy which was a good thing. The difference between normal and classical is quite big but I think that it was good. After completing it on classic I'm trying impossible… and well it's as the name implies. I love it.  I really like the part where you build your squad and get experience for them and so on. There is also permadeath so whenever someone dies they stay dead. So there's a real sense of loss when your best soldier dies.

After your first fight you get to head back to base and begin customizing soldiers the way you want, even so they are named after and resemble your friends and family, giving you just that much more investment in their continued survival. But soon the fights become more intense with choosing between moving your characters to better positions or taking the risk to stand your ground and fight. The enemies you face get progressively harder as you advance through the story (unless you're on a harder difficulty then then they get harder no matter how much you've progressed) and all of them have different ways of fighting you off. The tension is always up to 10 and goes to 11 on those times where you're outnumbered, outgunned and running low on medikits. Even if you make it back to base the tension does not let up. Different countries start to panic and threaten to leave the council that fund your operations. You live or die on the choices you make on a shoe-string budget. You even begin to sell off important assets just to make it a few more days. This game is concentrated intensity and it will have you biting your nails and praying for just one more well-placed shot/credit/day/less panic bar/engineer/scientist/mission/movement tile/round all the way into the wee hours of the morning.

In the field you'll long for the time when you can get back to base hopefully with a full squad. Since mission are, for the most part randomly generated it has a huge replay value.

Without the load option, you will always commence and never retry the same difficult situation over and over again. Sometimes evacuation becomes a valuable option, to save what is left of your team. And there is the uphill fight, when your experienced soldiers are gone and you need to rely on s.h.i.v.s to get at least some resources for consolidation.

My only gripe with this game is that snipers seem to be extremely accurate, but until the late game, anyone with a rifle can't hit the ground by dropping the damn thing. Moral of the story: Bring at least two snipers on your fireteam.  Final verdict, awesome game. Worth the money without a doubt, and getting it for free with Bioshock Infinite just made it all the better.  EDIT:  I had to change my opinion of this game with Enemy Within. While I greatly enjoyed the vanilla game, getting half my squad killed off by freakin sectoids in the second ground mission while they were in cover made me rage quit. I started a new game, lost 4 guys to critical hits (all four shots) from SECTOIDS (the lowest enemy) while they were in low cover on HIGH GROUND.  I really do enjoy the vanilla game, but the expansion diffuclty on flipping EASY ramps up so hard and so fast that it isn't even fun. It's like the game wants you to quit, uninstall, and then kill yourself.  EDIT 2:  I really want you all to know that I really did want to enjoy this game. I tried so HARD to enjoy it. After writing the preceeding I decided that maybe it was a chance of fate and so I decided to not only fire up another game, but install a mod that takes away the 'Alpha Strike' that the AI gives itself by allowing the aliens to move to cover after you encounter them. Even with this advantage, on mission freaking ONE the opening mission of the campaign after the tutorial they killed two guys on my squad from INSANE ranges with ♥♥♥♥ing pistols (Sectoids) on turn freakin THREE. Know what? Done. I wish I could get my money back for this xpac. It's really giving me that old feeling I'd get when I would play Starcraft back in the day and I would just.. know.. that I was playing a cheater with a multiplayer trainer.",

It is one of my most treasured games of all time. It involved a LOT of micromanagement, from the 'which kind of ammo' for certain weapons (explosive, incendiary, armor piercing...) to buy (yes, you need to actually buy ammo), to the soldiers selection based on the stats (recruitment involved). You even have to hire scientists, engineers and so on. And then you have the 'proper' game, the action. OMG, it was difficult, but really addictive.  XCOM EU is a different game, not just the same one with better graphics, easier interface and 'dumbed down' micromanagement. No. A different animal. A beautiful and different animal. Is more focused on the action (TBS)... and its really well executed.  I like to play it on a slow pace, enjoying every bit of it. Right now, I'm around 30 hours, and maybe 50% complete... and I'm not tired of it AT ALL... can't stop playing it. You have to understand that 30 hours is a lot to me, because I can only play about an hour per day (if I'm lucky)... and add my backlog to that... 30 hours is really good, I really have to love the game to reach that.  If you liked the original X-Com, trust me, you'll love this one. Maybe you'll miss some aspects, but you'll like all the new perspective.

The meat of the game, tactical turn-based combat, was an OK experience (Line of sight system isn't perfect, sometimes an alien is right in front of you and your soldier can't see them, I didn't enjoy the Overwatch mechanic, and randomly activating 3 alien camps with one movement is not fun). The best part of this game is the squad system, you get to customize and outfit all your soldiers; there being different classes, abilities trees, weapons and equipment.  Sidenote: I do criticize Firaxis for releasing XCOM: Enemy Within as a standalone game on consoles, but on PC you have to buy the $32 base game XCOM: Enemy Unknown before you can play the $32 Enemy Within, which is just the same campaign as XCOM:EU with some extra missions and updates. I would recommend XCOM: EU, but buy Enemy Within only if you like the base game and if it goes on sale.",

Once you read some strategy guides or figured out how to go through step by step, you can kick some ♥♥♥, enjoy the game, and save Earth!

Playing against human players is always something different.  XCOM ENEMY WITHIN  Good news. Many bugs belonging to the vanilla videogame have been fixed and game looks much better now! In addition, different little things have been added, such as different animations, while dyin, moving, and so on. There still are some little imperfections but it's really hard (or impossible) to have the perfect videogame, nowadays too. I really suggest you to buy the videogame + this expansion.

The classic difficulty is not classic at all, it's just a losing game against rng roulette where aliens get instakill crits from maximum distance while your guize have 40% hit while standing two meters away, because 'hardocre yo!'.   Due to the above the game can randomly just lose itself for you. Example: one of these mind-numbingly boring VIP search and rescue council missions. I spot the VIP. I have to approach him for him to notice me. I cannot approach him without triggering two thin men spawns (that get a free turn). After I approach him, I cannot move him to a place where he won't be hit with a poisoning attack. After he gets poisoned, he panics. After he panics, he gets one-shot by one of the thin men that literally fall from the sky behind my line in automatic overwatch. Mission failed. 8/10, would rage again.  The tactical battle mechanics have literally nothing to do with classic UFO games bar the 'secret organization fights aliens in turns' premise. Even the most basic stuff like being able to shoot whenever and at whatever you want is not there. Instead, the game carbon copies the core mechanics (one move-one attack instead of ap, no free movement, 4 slot 'inventory', attacking through skills with 'action camera' animations and so on) from the so-called tactical jrpgs. Which is not surprising, considering this is a console game after all.  The strategic layer is more akin to EU, but of course horribly castrated with things like one base, one skyranger, one (scripted) alien base etc., because that's apparently what 20 years of advancements in gaming brings us.",

            "review_text": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown tries to revive the legendary XCOM series to it´s former glory and in some aspects it even succeeds. It's Cons lie mostly in limited economical and tactical options/behavior but it´s huge strengths are it´s charracter building, strategic and tactical decision making, Immersive cutscenes, events, music and story line. More on these below:  Pros: + Music, Voice acting, Immersion. XCom Enemy Unknown really puts you in the shoes of the Commander. Your key personnel continously brief on important matters and give you comments on new tech, items and mission results. This is boosted by excellent music and cutscenes. One of the most rewarding things is seing the beginning of an alien interrogation knowing that you lost some men to get the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. + Story Line This game progresses quite clearly after certain completed missions, research and other key events. + Soldier progression While it isn´t the same as in the old XCOM games. The progression of your soldiers has always been one of the key hooks in these games. To make it even better, all of your soldiers have their own looks &amp; personalities. They throw ballsy comments which makes losing one your best even more (if you are playing in NoLoad mode as these games should be played). + Strategic Decisioning Your choices really count. The losses you take in missions count. Losing a critical mission can hurt you in number of ways, the least of which is getting your best soldiers wiped. The path you take in research, engineering and base develoment count. Your starting continent counts. + Tactical skills and weapons There are lots of AoE weapons like rocket launchers and grenades plus your soldiers skills that can make the difference between life and death. While many of them can only be used once, they are often worth it. + Replay value Each run is different. Your soldiers are different. The events triggered won't be the same / they happen at different times. Mission rewards are different. Your starting continent can be changed (each continent has different bonuses).  Cons: - Very limited number of Economical choices compared to older XCOM games You can't really buy much in this game. Inventory management is dummed down and even the country income is not based on your results but only on how many countries you have under your satellite cover.  -Simplified tactical combat You start with only 4 soldiers. In time you can get this to 6. This is a very low number when you are playing in a noload mode. (In old X-Com this was around 14). Unless you have certain exp boosts on your soldiers, you can only shoot once per turn. With this in mind a lvl 1 soldier can't really anything usefull in the later game. Combat itself overemphasizes taking cover and flanking enemy cover. Enemies (and your soldiers) are practically free kills.  -No inventory management in tactical combat our soldiers cannot pick items from fallen soldiers. Have one of your soldiers bleed to death while there is medkit on the ground next to him and you will feel what I mean. You simply can't pick up anything. For alien items this explain: They explode when the wielder dies, but you can't pick them up after you have stunned one either.  - Tactical combat intiations Most important thing in this game is not to see enemies at the end of your. When you see an enemy, they get to move first. If this is followed by enemy turn, your enemy can move your entire sight radius and get some free kills before you can do anything. After you realize this and start avoiding late turn spotting, the game gets a lot easier and kinda boring. In addition to this you shouldn't trigger more than 1 set of enemies at a time. This is even more important than covering your flank, which makes it quite counter intuitive.   To Sum it Up: To be honest, if you are looking for a same kind of tactical game as XCOM Apocalypse, XCOM Terror From the Deep or UFO Enemy Unknown, you will be disappointed in one way or another. While this game have some painfull cons, overall it really is a good game to say the least. With some tweaks it would be a great game. Easily worth one or two runs. I strongly recommend starting with normal difficulty and noload mode. It is challenging, but manageble even with no earlier experience.",

The layers of strategy upon strategy make this game an incredibly deep experience and getting attached to your characters (and renaming them to friends and family member's name) gives an emotional investment as well.

Like... if Good was... 80%, and Great was 90%, and Perfect was 100%, this game is a solid 89%.  THE GOOD: The game uses modern ideas regarding user interface to simplify a lot of the unnecessarily complex portions of the original game system *without significantly reducing quality*. That last bit is important. Dumbing down a system for the sake of making it simple is usually a disastrous move, but X-Com still feels pretty complex and strategy-minded despite simplifying the way in which your squads move and interact with the world. The added skill-driven leveling system is a welcome addition, and I found soldier and squad management to be a very enjoyable part of the game. Had a lot of fun.  THE BAD: The simplification process removed a lot of the technical things you could do to improve your chances of survival. It is now much more difficult to remove cover from an enemy because free-targetting on most weapons was removed. Also, the removal of time units seriously limits the amount of off-turn defensive fire you can provide. Finally, the method by which you discover aliens was a nice effort but in my opinion, was very poorly designed. Aliens you discover immediately use free actions to get into cover, and then act on their next turn, but aliens will rarely, if ever, discover your squad if you are in a fortified position. This means that exploration is a very dangerous activity, and it discourages a player from using his squad tactically to flank enemies for fear of discovering squads of additional ones. In the end, the safest way to proceed is to simply have one of your squad run as far as he can at normal speed, then retreat back to a full squad on overwatch if anything is discovered. It feels a bit tedious and cheap-♥♥♥♥♥, and i felt like the tactical element of the game suffered somewhat as a result of the need to cheat the game to cope with the unbalanced discovery system. The maps also felt really small and linear in comparison to the original Xcom, so some of the suspense of exploring an open map is lost.  THE UGLY: The random number generator is a vicious and implaccable foe in this game. There are some truly frustrating moments when it feels like cover has no effect and your soldiers are totally defenseless. As someone who has beaten this game on the harder difficulties and also Ironman mode, the best advice I can give you is: research and produce the highest level of armor you can as soon as you can. It will save the lives of your soldiers. Having the highest level officers possible at any given time is important.  TL;DR: Game's recommended. Some of the facets of the old game are lost in the translation but I feel like Xcom gained more than it lost in the most recent incarnation. Looking forward to DLC/Sequels.",

It’s a reboot of a old franchise in new guise, where it's streamlined and modern without dumbing down on what made the original so good.  You care and feel for the soldiers under your command, and cry as they get killed (by something you did or just bad luck). All while following a storyline that got a distinct feel of old Sci Fi Horror B movies, something i think really work in the game's favor. That said, for those that are not into the “classic” mode and every decision is final and no take backs, there is modes where you can save and play less punishing to your gameplay.  As far as multiplayer goes it is a bit bare bones, if you have friends into it and want to take some turn based action there is some stuff to work with here. Issue is mostly the fact that it is point based, it has little customization value and overall it is kind of weak compared to other titles of this type. I would get it for its single player and then do MP if you feel like friends are up for it or just pretend it is not there.  So, does it hold up to the old game? I think it is better, as I said earlier they streamlined the game to make it more accessible, easy to understand, a clear understandable UI and a good story to go with the attacks. You feel like you are fighting the good fight, you feel like every step could be fatal and you take your time to think through your actions to keep your men and the human race safe.  You owe it to yourself to own this game and have it in your collection, so show the alien filth that this is our planet, and they are getting an eviction.",

However, if you are looking for an easy, Blow-the-aliens-up-and-save-the-world type game, this is NOT for you. The game is hard, even on the lower difficulties. I have had this game for a couple of years now and I have completed the storyline. Once. And this was after I had re-loaded saves, after losing most, or all my men. The content is amazing, the way that you play and unlock weapons and updgrades is very clever, and I have found that one of the reasons this game can be hard is if you don't research the right stuff by the right time, meaning that the aliens shoot ahead of you, with you losing a lot of your men, and having a bunch of rookies. The aliens are well designed, however some of them are painfully over-powered, which is exactly how the game should be. It is a real challenge to complete, and you have a real sense of achievement when you complete it. That said, you will probably spend a very very long time on this game, with multiple games, but you will definitly improve, and learn from your mistakes. There are a few bugs and glitches, but not that many, and there are mostly only with view. A couple of times, I have had soldiers die because of mis-clicking and movement which I didn't tell them to do. It was fine. I lived in the end.

They've streamlined &amp; simplified things &amp; yet somehow still managed to retain enough so that it doesn't feel as if it's been dumbed down. You're left with nail biting decisions such as 'should i rush forward to finish off this alien &amp; risk exposing new aliens'? Or 'should i take that 40% shot or cower in cover?'.

The research and base management can get a bit clunky, but they're still good overall. With all sorts of different tools in the main menu, you can also put a lot of different constraints and changes to a playthrough, making it more interesting and challenging just to your liking.  The only downside is that the maps can get repetitive after a while, so unless you're planning on buying Enemy Within (which is a great DLC, but I'd advise to get it on sale) or downloading Long War (a fantastic mod that completely changes the game and adds much more content) you'll have the maps memorized within 20 hours or so. Also, some of the controls, especially the rockets, can be unresponsive. Other than that, the game's very good.  Good luck Commander.",

Its seeding mechanic also makes suggested 'randomness' not really random since it is all predetermined when the map loads, where procedures occur based off of your actions instead of random response as it should be--it reduces the strategy and urgency in this strategy game with urgency in its story, imho, by forcing the random number generator to be more static. Even when set to 'random' it still is procedural, and by no means actually randomised. I understand the devs' position on wanting to prevent players from reloading saves to make the same choice for better results, but I do not agree with it since the game's probability is so broken to begin with. If they wanted to take a hard stance on development choices without protest, they needed to iron out the flaws tied to the decision.  Still, I sunk time into it, albeit swearing all of the while. Good game, it needs work which will never come, and it needs Steam workshop for mods made specifically to fix bugs and other problems that the devs will continue to ignore (these mods exist online already, but they are not integrated with Steam). This game's problems are too outstanding for me to ignore despite what is good, and the shortcomings are too numerous to like this game more than it allows me to.

A turn-based game, its steady pace of new resources, abilities and enemies delivers a rewarding experience.  As the commander of the newly initiated XCOM project, you must lead your Soldiers (in squads of 4-6 in each mission) against an emergent alien threat. Soldiers are fairly unique (certain options can widen the gap between Soldier base stats); each is made up of a mix of RP stats (gender, race and a voice type for personality) and battle stats (Health, Aim, willpower). While unit health and Aim are determined only by class and rank, will power can vary wildly between 2 Soldiers, based on that Soldiers service. In addition to stats, classes determine weapon loadouts, skill trees and movement ranges. Variations in the class (2 choices of skills at 2 separate ranks) can turn two SOldiers of the same class into completely different specialists.  As the Commander, you are also responsible for maintaining order planet-wide via manegement of 'panic levels' for each of your member countries; let panic rise too high and you loose support, loose too much support and your project may be disbanded. Panic levels can be lowered or maintained via performance on missions and selection of missions in a member-states territory or missions provided by your ominous counsel of ominousness.  R&amp;D, base staffing, construction and funding is also your responsability. While staffing occurs naturaly over time, you will sometimes need to choose between extra funds or R&amp;D personel. R&amp;D itself is a standard fair, set your labrats on a task and they'll knock it out in time; which projects are available depends on prior research and your dedication to capturing/killing the aliens. Construction of your base is slightlly randomized (several 'tiles' have special facilities that can be made only there), and grants bonuses for construction similar facilities on like 'tiles'  The challenge of the game is completely customizable, though I would recomend default settings for first time players. Despite the main story remaining the same, adjustments in difficulty (something as small as selecting a different starting country) can give an entirely different experience.  The expansion content enhances the main story line, making it unnecessary* to play the base game, even for first time players. In fact, I would recomend against playing without the expansion if possible, as the added maps help keep the experience fresh. However, the base game still delivers on a fantastic experience.  *As of this writting, there is 1 achievement that cannot be acquired through playing the expansion content",

You take the role of the 'commander' a faceless entity who issues orders on the battlefield to your 5 man unit while also juggling research/engineering/training back at home base.   Starting off you have limited options but the game does well in introducing new features, the interface is user friendly and everything is well explained.  As you get further in the game you have lots of options; Do you build a satelitte nexus? - So you can have full coverage over Asia/Africa?, Do you invest all your monthly earnings in Research&amp;Development?   You have to be careful as some countries might leave the XCOM program if the panic lvl stays in the red, diplomatic missions and satellitte coverage can help reduce this.

In the same style as the original, humanity starts at a major disadvantage. It's up to you to throw dispensable jarheads at the aliens 'til humanity can invent technology capable of stopping them... and then, you know, figure out how to turn the tables and stop them murderizing everyone.  The standard difficulty is difficult enough that you're gonna die within a month until you get to grips with it. Then it's still pretty dámn difficult. Of course, if you want a challenge you can opt for classic difficulty to make it as hard as the original. And then there's impossible mode. Like you're ever gonna finish it on classic.  Anyways.

You'll control a squad of up to six varied soldiers taking on a variety of mission types, all with the eventual goal of stopping the alien threat. Each soldier has one of several classes (like a Sniper or Support medic) with special skills for that class that make your job easier the more you level up.

The different strategies required to most effectively utilize the strenths of the different classes (especially once they get into their respective skill trees) encourages a dynamic, and most often edge of your seat approach. As the game develops, there are plenty of little intricacies you can use to more fully capitalize on a class too - gear, weapons, even machines. Your guys feel powerful and yet fragile. Its so gratifying when your sniper can double tap for 30+ damage. But with the fist pumps come the sighs on the other hand....  While there is a tutorial, there were some key aspects of the game, most notably the economy, which I didn't know about until further into my game, which was frustrating because I'd already allocated my precious money in another area. Its unforgiving, and can be a real handicap. A few times I rolled my eyes at the 'bad guy pop out one shot critical - my captain is dead' factor - while that adds to the risk, and thus the fun in escaping with another victory, the setback the next mission is palpable and frustrating.  Overall a risk taking game that I really enjoyed. Its plenty of hours and highly engaging. 9/10.",

I'm trying out the popular Long War mod now, because it adds a lot of depth/ character/ difficulty to the game but I have no idea why I'm even doing that, since I can't even complete the base game. It may have something to do with the fact that I insist on playing on Ironman mode, I like the idea that of having to live with my decisions but it just ends up being a horribly masochistic choice to make...  XCOM: Enemy Unknown, and it's exemplary expansion, Enemy Within is a reboot of an old, venerable turn based strategy franchise. I've never played any of the old XCOMs, and die-hard fans will say this is a casualization of the franchise, but I found this game to be amazing, and definitley very tactically deep. Essentially, you are placed in charge of a top secret military organization that is formed, funded, and supported by every major nation on the planet, activated with... you guessed it, when ALIENS ATTACK! The game does a phenomenal job of making you feel outgunned and outmatched, you truly feel like you're fighting a desperate war where victory seems literally impossible. If you play on the harder difficulties especially with Ironman, you'll bemoan the loss of your troops and the failure of your actions.  Most of the game is spent in a tactical top down view of combat with aliens. Pretty standard fare, similar to the Fire Emblem series with more ranged weapons, but in between missions you spend time at a secret underground base where you build laboratories, factories, and research/ interrogate alien species to help you better fight future battles. A shadowy group of country representatives known as The Council funds you and critiques your mission performance, however, you don't have enough resources to respond to every attack around the world all the time, so you have to pick and choose which countries you want to keep from 'panicking.' If a country 'panics' they'll pull out from funding you, giving you even less resources to choose from. This leads to an interesting moral choice, similar to the old Atari game Missile Comand where you have to protect cities from getting destroyed. Should you try to save every country, or just focus on a few, and forget the rest? The Enemy WIthin expansion allows you to augment the ever living ♥♥♥♥ out of your soldiers, leading to amputations/ enhancements that lend better combat abilities but also make you feel as if you are losing your humanity. In my opinion, since we are all getting lasered to death by aliens anyway, of course I would augment the ♥♥♥♥ out of my soldiers to give us a chance, but it's up to you, really.  XCOM: Enemy Unknown is one of the best strategy games on PC and you should probably own it already, but if you don't, pick it up if you like Fire Emblem/ Independence Day or if you enjoy strategy titles in general. I love that since this game was so difficult, the canonical ending of the game is that we failed. WE ALL FAILED, GUYS, THE ALIENS WON! XCOM 2 appears to show an earth dominated by the aliens due to a complete failure of earth's defenses, and in that game, we'll get our second chance at finally completing the game. Can't wait to lose again!",

What it feels like is you are risking a squad of your best, most skilled, and most cherished team mates. You don't know what's around the next corner (ha, seriously, not kidding on that one), but they believe in you. They trust to make the tough choices, the right choices, so they can help make the world a better, safer place from those alien scum that will stop at nothing to wipe out humanity. Oh and you also throw in a rookie with them cause you need him to skill up. (And why did my random 'class type' rolls mean I only got 2 support class but like 10 heavy's?!!!)  Really enjoyed the tactic stuff (quickly learned that rushing into the fog of war is a BIG no-no). Growing attached to a few of my best. Killing the bad guy and saving my team with the last shot from the last person on the last move of my turn. Also, when you get the best weapons and gear and are taking the battle to enemy (thank you lab guys).  Really no a fan of the way the random enemy spawn means occasionally you move the first guy like 1 step forward and suddenly every enemy on the map appears - aaarrrgggh! Or Missing with the last shot from the 3 person in a row. That's the random number generator for you.  Also, it looks kinda nice, and you can whittle quite a bit time customising the look of your people.  Overall, totally enjoyed. ",

The game is full of cute additions that quite quickly become incredibly annoying. The constant talking heads (some of which can be disabled in the expansion apparently), the little cutscenes, the soldier voice acting; they simply make the game less enjoyable as you go along. You can disable them, but you'd think they'd make 'fluff' less aggrivating. There are other 'features' that I found offputting, useless, or hindered my enjoyment. The entire 'Ant Farm' base being a good example of something that serves absolutely no function.  Gameplay is simplified from the original X-Com quite a bit, sometimes with artificial limitations that don't make sense when looked at critically. My honest opinion about the game was that the AI cheated, or the game had no idea how to computate odds for various actions. Which is odd, given that the original X-Com; a very difficult game never felt like it cheated. It comes down to the difference in presentation: One soldier in X-Com means nothing. In Enemy Unknown it means everything. That one soldier can be the difference between failure and loss; making the AI 'cheating' or being 'cheap' incredibly frustrating.  Also has to be mentioned that 2K promised mod support prior to release, but then changed their tune once the game came out, including making the game 'call home', which nukes mod support unless you run it offline or without autoupdate. Not a cool move. There's also the bugs, which last I played were quite bad and patch support was very slow.  Despite that, it's still a solid strategy game. In no way do I think it is anywhere near the original game, but it's a solid attempt. For me, there are enough issues and questionable design decisions that I don't know if I'll ever get the enjoyment I could have out of it. If you don't have any illusions for X-Com, or just want a solid modern strategy game, it's worth a look. I'd still recommend the original over the remake.",

This game has a lot going for it. Firaxis decided to go with core ideas from UFO Defence and then streamlined them to make them easier and somewhat more forgiving. The story in the game is decent but can get stale during a second game but this is made up during the missions you play in game. As you play the game you grow attached to soldiers that stand out or are general bad asses. You start out seeing them as rookies and then attach to them so much you are literally crying when you see him getting shot right in the face by a sectopod beam before dying. Even if they aren't complete badasses you can still connect even if it is the soldier that manages to miss the 99% shot at point blank. In my opinion that in itself makes the games 'story' different every playthrough. If you’re not lazy like me you could even read the incredibly well written flavour text that is honestly very interesting. On top of the flavour text the game gives off a very creepy atmosphere that overall makes up for the somewhat linear story and keeps you immersed in the game. The cover system in this game is extremely easy to learn and overall the games combat system is easy to get the hang of. The game’s tutorial is extremely helpful and gives you a good summary of what this game is about. The game is also interesting and fun when you are in your Xcom base. You are going to be mostly focusing on research because if you aren't researching new weapons and armor fast enough your soldiers are going to go into battle with huge disadvantages. But engineering is also important if you are playing on harder difficulties. The hardest decisions to make are what countries you want to help. Every month you are given 'abductions.' These are when you have 3 countries that need your help you have to choose 1 and then receive the reward that country gives. The countries that you don't help rise in panic and leave the Xcom Project (if too many countries leave you lose). The decisions are easy at first but later in the game the decisions get extremely hard and you'll have to really think about it. Overall this game is very entertaining. The only bad things that come to mind are the 'Xcom Glitches' aka funny animations and corpse ragdolls that are funny looking but break immersion for some people, and the somewhat dated graphics that still hold up but are beginning to show their age. But other than that the game is extremely fun to anyone who plays.   Final Rating 9/10",

            "review_text": "For a game nearly devoid of meaningful plot, characterisation and dialogue; it certainly has a way of wrenching your heart strings every time a squad member has a brush with mortality.   Let's assume you've been sleeping under a rock and have just noticed this gem on a steam sale - XCom: Enemy Unknown is a reboot/remake of a 90s classic tactical turn-based, squad-based shooter.   The core gameplay is centred on your select cohort of highly trained multinational supersoldiers, with the general hope to rid earth of a multiracial group of alien baddies. XCom itself is the title of a highly advanced international military cell tasked with the defence of its constituent nations from an unknown threat. You play the part of its commander, and you answer to a Council of the world's constituent nations.   So far so good? Game on.  This defending of nations business comes about by completing global missions for various nations with differing objectives; taking your soldier's differing abilities into account as you shift, turn by turn, into nail-biting trades of gunfire with whichever variant of alien crusader you're pitted against. As you complete missions, you earn the means to research your increasingly diverse foes; with incrementally more valuable and powerful rewards as you reverse-engineer the enemy's technology to suit your own purposes.  Missions are received as a result of successfully intercepting invading craft (provided you've managed your infrastructure of defensive satellites and aircraft over the world's nations), defending nations as abductions and alien terrorism takes place, or on a particular assignment (story-specific mission) from the 'Council' itself. These missions develop nicely in both complexity and variety as the game goes on.  The challenge, and the game itself, lies in the brutally indifferent nature of the random number generator. It decides whether your '95%' aim chance will actually connect, or whether you'll be left watching your precious soldier being blasted into meat paste by plasma fire. Your soldier's innate class abilities offer a rewarding approach to tactical thought as you mitigate the random nature of the gunfights with careful squad placement and movement.  The classes are the centrepiece of your progression throughout the game. As you inevitably settle down on a chosen few soldiers to take on the majority of missions, they gain experience and additional abilities according to their class. These will be pretty familiar to any players of traditional squad-based shooters: long-range, high damage snipers; exceptionally mobile assault units; versatile support units; and high impact heavy units. Each class features an ability tree that provides each soldier with an increasing number of tactical perks to better your chances against ET nasties. Such a careful progression of a chose few individuals make the high-risk gameplay all the more immersive as you will literally cry out with the untimely demise of a hardened veteran. Though the game is ingenious in its ability to never leave you feeling cheated: it is always your mistake.  As mentioned, the other aspect of game progression is presented in technological research. As you encounter more advanced and lethal enemies, you gain more opportunities to better equip your soldiers with advanced weapons, armour and useable items. This is also linked to another mechanic of base-building, where you progressively advance your homebase with laboratories and workshops as you gain the reward of additional staff from nations you've successfully defended.   Whilst so many facets of a game may sound fractured and confusing, the mechanics tie together in a very satisfying manner. Your gametime takes you from an initial desperate scrabble - barely managing from mission-to-mission as soldiers die to superior enemies and countries drop out of the XCom program as you fail to defend them - to a final plateau where you task your honed team of veterans to finish off the alien menace, once and for all.  The game offers a few twists and turns with story missions that allude to a central plot line, though the real enjoyment is testing your favourite soldiers against whatever challenge the game throws at you. There is a genuine satisfaction to be had in having soldiers become ridiculously powerful in terms of combat ability, purely as a result of surviving high odds through your initial struggles.  The Enemy Within DLC presents a new twist to the campaign story with new enemy variants and mission types, as well as sprucing up the soldier classes with the moral quandary that is alien augmentation. You can either opt to hone your soldiers with genetic modification, with more options provided as you discover new aliens from which to splice genes; or do away with their limbs entirely and give them a massively powerful mechanised suit.   The game underlies this newfound power nicely with thoughtful quips from your research staff questioning the intrinsic trade-off of humanity for alien power as you further meddle with your soldiers.  Philosophical tangents aside, the DLC brings enjoyable variety to an already feature-packed game.   Made it thus far? Now the not-so-good. There are some incredible bugs to be found, even at this stage in post-game patching. I’ve been forced to alt-F4 essential story missions as a result of hitches in gameplay with little motivation to continue from where I left off. There are well documented bugs in final-stage missions, especially poor considering the amount of player investment to get to these points.   I’d recommend saving often, if only so you don’t have to trudge dutifully through already-played sections to reach critical points.",

That's XCOM, baby! A game where it's actually more fun when you're getting your ♥♥♥ handed to you. Sure, sometimes it's fun to curb stomp aliens, but when you're really fighting to keep hope alive across the planet, that's when you truly get the full experience. It does sometimes feel like the shot percentages straight up lie to you, but the randomness of everything always keeps you on your toes. You're never really safe until the last alien lies dead at your feet.  The DLC is worthwhile, too. Enemy Within makes major changes to the base game, all of which are quite nice. The bonus missions and squaddie you get from the Slingshot Pack are sweet, and even the simple cosmetic changes given by the Elite Soldier Pack are worthwhile if only because they let you make your Squaddies that much more unique.  In short, it's a well crafted game that will keep you coming back again and again.",

They're too clunky, too micro-management intensive, with mechanics favoring people who are colloquially referred to as 'grognards.' Aside from some PC-only holdouts, the turn-based strategy has been considered a dead genre for years. They tried to revive XCOM as a shooter once, with expected results. They were (are?) trying to revive it as a shooter a second time. But as Enemy Unknown teaches us, there's no need for that. Firaxis knows how to make turn-based strategy games where the focus is on actual fun stuff.   XCOM: Enemy Unknown may be multi-platform, but it's not 'dumbed down for console.' The important stuff is all here. Earth is under attack by aliens. You lead a military organization dedicated to intercepting and repelling these attacks. You got a base to expand, soldiers of different classes to train, tech research to develop, weapons and armor to build. At first you're hanging on for dear life, overwhelmed by the enemy's superiority. Your soldiers die easily and often. You can't be everywhere or save everybody. You have many things to do and not enough money to do them all. But figure out a balance, and eventually you'll turn the tide.  THAT is XCOM to me. Not 'Time Units.' Not buying individual clips of bullets to individually assign to individual soldiers. Not 3 pages of steps in the manual you need to follow just to throw a grenade. All that stuff from the old games is gone here. The nuts and bolts of combat and base building have all undergone a total overhaul, and the result is something that is serving as an introduction to turn-based strategy for an entire generation of gamers. Now if you want to throw a grenade, you just select the button. The diehard aficionados can still crank up the difficulty as needed (the jump from 'Normal' to 'Classic' is...significant), or let their aspie flag fly over Xenonauts.  The single-player is the kind of game you can play and replay time and again, since it's never exactly the same twice. (Well, you'll see the combat maps repeat quite a bit.) But there's also competitive multiplayer, and from what I gather it's fairly well-liked. Personally, I never bothered with it. Not when the campaign is the kind of thing that makes you stay up until 4 AM.  So far, the DLC hasn't been worth it. Customizing your soldiers with additional colors and giving the option to wear hats is nice, but not for the money they're charging. I'd rather see other customization options. They go out of their way to show that the soldiers come from nations all over the world, yet the voices you can assign are all virtually identical. Similarly, the fact that the invasions happen throughout multiple countries is not in any way reflected by the combat maps. China, the United States, and South Africa all look the same. In light of that, the fat that one DLC adds a few more council missions and a guy with a unique voice set sounds like a good idea...until you realize those missions will now happen every playthrough now.  Honestly? I doubt I needed to recommend this to anybody. XCOM: Enemy Unknown was a top seller on Steam for weeks, and it's almost sure to be Game of the Year. It's a major hit on all systems, and companies are taking note. Why, we're going to see a new version of Space Hulk soon!",

If you really want it, here it is.  XCOM: Enemy Unknow is a turn-based strategy game where you fight the aliens from outer space. The game present to you the story in just the way that you will know the basic of what is going on quite loosely and have you fulfilled the rest of the story yourself through your campaign.  The story is just as I mentioned before. The aliens come out of nowhere, kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of us. We(the nations) form the special operation called XCOM to fight back. And you happend to be its commander.   So your job is to lead the squad of four soldiers(which can be expanded into 6 at maximum in most difficulties) to the battle fields. Fight the aliens through turn-based strategy system which, as you can imagine, you move your sqaud and they move theirs. You have to try exploiting the territory by the cover system, flank system and ♥♥♥♥ tons of depth in gameplay you'll experience in game.   Your squad then will grow or gain ranks. And through ranks comes abilities which will help you in your quest. The abilities comes in two branches which you can choose which one you want your soldier to be.   Your soldiers start off as the rookies and then will be determined/assigned classes randomly. The classes consist of 4 different classes which are 'assault','sniper','heavy' and 'support'. Each class has its own good side and bad side which you can and must exploit it to full use especially in the harer campaign.   The Assault, as the name suggests, do assault. The Assault specializes in close-range combat. They can run&amp;gun, have high rate of critical in close-range and can dodge reaction fire with lightning reflex skill and else. But again, they are still but human not a tank and this game is nothing but XCOM. So don't try have him or her go on ramboing through hordes of aliens because inevitably they will end up being corpses.   The Sniper, again as the name suggests, specializes in long-range combat. They have high accuracy in long-range but poor in close-range due to the distant penalty. You can place them really far behind the front line(as long as the sight is not covered) and still have them shoot the ♥♥♥♥ out of that ♥♥♥♥er who really annoys the ♥♥♥♥ out of you. All that is possible due to the ability you gain when your rank climbs up. This unit will be a crucial unit in your team since they can get you out of tigh situations if being used wisely. And yes, the sniper is very vulnerable so tacke good care of him.   The Heavy specializes in heavy weapon and rocket firing. They do deal a lot of damage but have the lowest accuracy of all. This unit is again very useful if being used wisely. The rocket can be exploited the way you might never imagine so keep your eyes peeled.   The Support is the most crucial class of all. Why? Because they can travel the furthest, have the highest accuracy of all(but sniper), can smoke up your team either to cover their flank or psych them up and hell, they carry medkits and can revive your critically wounded unit. Isn't that awesome! They are awesome in these ways but yet also they can't win the battle for you alone. The bottom line is that you always have the support in your team no matter what.   And moreover than that, you can craft the robot to fight along you. You will eventually have your team use psionic power or become mech soldiers to help you fight the aliens.   The aliens also come in various forms. There are the lowest rank Sectoid to the Highest rank Ethereal. They can kick the ♥♥♥♥ out of you and they will do just like that.   Aside of the combat, You will do the researches on technologies and build facilities. You will receive monthly expense to spend on the researches and facilities. You will expand your base deep down underground and try to balance the panic level around the world and not to have the nations abandoned the project.   The campaing is around 15-20 hours long(for me) but you can definitely make it longer or shorter depending on your skills in combating and base management.  And that seems to wrap up all the basics you need to know to be convinced enough to buy this game.   So please, Do yourself a favor and click that little purchase button and enjoy the hell out of XCOM: Enemy unknown!  ",

It's not an exact replica, obviously the graphics are updated significantly, and some of the gameplay details are changed slightly. Overall, I think they've actually IMPROVED on the gameply of the orginal, while retaining all of the most fun aspects of the original.  The original game featured multiple bases, in this version there's just one enormous (eventually) base to manage, which keeps things simpler. The funding, panic, UFO interception, research and engineering is all basically the same. The combat missions are still turn-based, but they've simplified the interface. You still have a limited number of movement 'points', but rather than make it look like a board game, the numbers are mostly kept off screen in favor of a bar graph, HUD style pop-up that floats above the active soldier, so you can see in a glance what your soldier can do in a given turn.  During combat, the perspective swoops in to a third person, over-the-shoulder view when aiming at enemy targets. This effect is really nice, in fact one of the most pleasing aspects of the entire game is the way the 'camera' swoops and pans smoothly from one screen to the next, kind of the way you can zoom in on a GPS map... it's a nice effect and really engages you while playing.  There's a good reason this game has such high ratings, both published and posted - It's a fantastic game, and for anyone who is too young to remember the series' beginnings, this game is a great introduction.

            "review_text": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a modern remake of an old classic game. The game is set in a near-future where UFOs start to invade Earth. It becomes clear that these sectoids are not friendly, and an international squad of soldiers and scientists, XCOM, is activated.  This is a strategy game, and it is a strategy game on two levels. The action takes place in a turn-based tactical setting. The other mode is a management simulation, which puts you in charge of the XCOM headquarters. You are responsible for recruiting soldiers, building support structures, overseeing research, and so on.   The turn-based missions are not based on reaction time, but on strategic positioning and commands. Use of height, cover, and line of sight can win or lose the mission. This puts the battles as more of an intellectual challenges that a brute force one.   As a simulator, the game is fairly streamlined, like a typical Firaxis game these days. The micromanagement is pretty easy to figure out, and the game doesn't let you overlook necessary steps. So it's a strategy game the typical person can pick up and play.  Where it really differs from the original is the difficulty. The classic XCOM is frustratingly hard, and your team will die. I won't say this version is easy, but it has been designed for playability. The ironman mode does make it more challenging.   There are a few technical issues, mostly driver-related in my experience. The game does crash a bit, and some missions cause poor performance on lower-end graphics. Fortunately, this does not affect turn-based play much. The controls are intended for a gamepad, and although they do work on a keyboard and mouse, there are issues with aiming when using a mouse. I recommend a gamepad for this, as it reduces the chance of your target changing when you click.  So it's a great strategy game, not so much depth or micromanagement as other strategy games, as this one is more based on combat positioning, instead of balacing numbers. Which is perfectly fine.",

            "review_text": "I know it says I've only clocked 41 minutes. But recently I didn't have internet for a week, and in my desperation I stopped playing Xenonauts and played this. 15 hours of gameplay later, and I'm still hooked. I know it doesn't have that original XCom feel that Xenonauts captures, but in the words of Vaas, 'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over...'. Hell, we give the CoD Series for doing the same thing over and over XD.   But I digress, Xenonauts, you see cities being bombed as a piece of writing on the Geoscape, in this you see those cities literally being bombed, you experience the chaos first hand. I found myself asking in Xenonauts 'Where is the worlds Armies, these aliens aren't too hardcore and ♥♥♥♥, we're using Ballistic Weapons and don't even have proper body armour'. My Solders dont feel that elite. In XCom i find myself feeling that the world is doing what they can to stop the Invasion, but my *Elite* (as they are called in both games) Soldiers, the worlds best, are fighting back hard. Not only that, but we have the Tech to stop the invasion.   I love the cutscenes within, as we discover technologies and the 3 main characters talk among themselves about findings. It really makes the game more indepth, more intresting and adds to the story. Xenonauts, though the writing is very good, its writing, and it doesn't get you as involved. But the cutscene everytime you find Aliens gets a bit old after a while.  I prefer the Interception Missions in Xenonauts, which relies on Skill rather than Luck, but the ground combat, which is the brunt of both games, is far more intresting XD. I love the little cutscenes that go on as your men do things, and the whole hunting of the aliens is like the calm before the storm. You get kinda nervous, the tension rises. Where are they, how many, what kind? You get into a big gunfight, scrape out of it by the skin of your teeth, kill what you hope is the last one, but the mission isnt over, theres more of them out there somewhere.   You get cocky after a few good missions, you be more reckless, these Aliens are easy to kill! But then everything goes to ♥♥♥♥, the man, you favourite amazingly, on the left flank is dead, the rest of your troops are underfire, panicking, theyre on your flank! Another woman down! A Cryssalid comes out of nowhere and poisons your man, the rest run, and then your team is dead.   Which leads to another part of both games I love. The Character Creation, I always make sure I rename characters after people I know, just because it makes the game so much more fun, as you actually get attached to troops. Where Xenonauts doesnt let you change the look of your people, this one does, which helps in the creation, however you can't choose the class of your men, where as in Xenonauts you could, which really bugs me. I play with the Not Created Equally option on, so my men all have different stats, and it still bugs me that the guy with 80 Accuracy gets assigned Assault (Running a square away from the enemy and shotgunning them in the back of the head) and the guy with 60 Accuracy gets given Sniper (Sit at a distance and take potshots) -.-. But that one bug where if your man is next to a window, he'll always break it when shooting, even if he isn't shooting through that window makes me laugh everytime which makes up for it XD.   But I ramble too much. 8/8 gr8 r8 m8.",

It was worth every penny I paid for it.  This game is supremely well designed. Solid gameplay, engaging storyline, excellent graphics, and great DLC. Everything you would expect from a AAA title and then some.  The game has a solid tutorial and works right into the first mission. It was easy to get the hang of, but almost impossible to get perfect. The interface is intuitive and provides all the information you need (weapons, ammo, targeting, chance to hit, line of sight, etc...). This game made me give turn-based gaming another chance (I'd never been a big fan of turned-based games) and I'm incredibly glad that I did.

Tactics is excellent in this game - well just watch some youtube videos and you'll have an idea if that is your cup of tea.  There is a linearity to the game in contrast other Sid Meier's titles - a story is unfolding as you play, and there's not very much parallelism other than unit levelling.  All the tactical maps are pre-written, so once you understand the layout, it gets just slightly redundant - but it's not bad.  The technology tree is quite blind - all you know is the duration of what you're about to research, but no details about how that new thing will compare to what you're currently using.  As a personal preference this game is not my favorite, but it's good enough to come back to and get right back in and try out some new ideas.  Will I buy XCOM2? Almost certainly. I might wait for a sale price, but XCOM: Enemy Unknown has sold me on the franchise.  UPDATE: I forgot all about the zombies. There's something about zombies in a science fiction game that just breaks my immersion. It's like the game stops taking itself seriously at that point.",

            "review_text": "Ah, X-COM. Few series can boast to be as long-running or as divisive as this one. The original game was known for its complex tactics, complicated mechanics, intensive micromanagment, and occasional silly moments; victory was possible through good tactics and a good equipment loadout. This one... is different.  Firaxis came around over a decade later and decided to reboot the franchise with a risky venture. They simplified or outright removed many mechanics in order to remove a lot of the tedium of the old games. Gone is the clunky micromanagment of checking everyone's ammo and equipment, and of individually moving each of your many soldiers step by step across the wide fields; now everyone gets one primary weapon, one pistol, one armor, one item, and one class that is randomly assigned despite you already having half of your roster filled with Heavies. You also have to move each soldier only on the paths recommended by the computer, which often says that it counts as dashing to walk through that open door to enter good cover three spaces away but you're free to run through three buildings to shimmy up a pipe and take low cover on the opposite side of the map. Aiming is also handled by this same computer that says you can not shoot at the enemy around the corner, but it is free to get a flanking shot on that same character without moving. Remember slowly expanding to have multiple bases so that you could cover every continent and have multiple strike teams out at once? Now you get one base and one Skyranger to try and cover the entire globe while panic builds in the countries you're no longer able to cover! Fun!  Whenever new gimmicks were added on for this reboot, they were often done just to punish old tactics. Did you want to rush in aggressively and take out the enemies before they could do anything? Too bad, mate! Each group of enemies gets a free movement period when first discovered to take great cover against your soldier who just used half of their turn! Did you want to sit back and snipe? Woe to the long-range fighter, as many enemies now possess teleportation, unerring poison spit, invisibility, enough health to take full bursts from your entire squad, and insane movement rates in order to dissuade the sniper. How about using explosives to take out cover or large groups of enemies? Well, actually, just like the old X-COM games that still busts most of the loot you wanted, so that's still the same. There's an enemy type and an accompanying ability to punish anything you might try that would be seen as 'intelligent tactics', and you're only allowed to carry one countering item per person; that's presuming you psychically knew to bring those items along beforehand for that specific enemy hazard and did not mind giving up a different loadout for your team. Really, the only way to win with minimum casualties is to always have known in advance exactly what all will be waiting for you in the next randomized mission and gear up specifically for it. Fair!  The plot? It's actually better than the original, but not by much. Oh, but don't worry too much about it! The sequel totally retcons everything you were meant to accomplish in this game anyways, so any progress you make against the stacked RNG just to get to that next story objective is entirely meaningless. F***!  If you want to get maximum possible enjoyment from this game, then wait for it to go on sale and play it on any difficulty lower than 'Classic' so that the RNG isn't quite as broken; it will not fix any of the inherent system flaws or bugs, but at least your soldiers will not arbitrarily miss an enemy that is only one tile away... assuming they're allowed to target it in the first place.",

However it has a few downsides. The combat is purely chance based, and on higher difficulties these odds just stack more and more against you, meaning tactics mean less and less as random shots fired with a pistol from enemies miles away will instantkill your sniper, while your sniper just spent three turns missing the same alien, standing still in the open. Then the turn after 6 brutes with more hp each than you can deal out in a turn spawn on top of your position and annihilates you. These kind of cheap difficulty adjustment concepts just makes you annoyed and reduces the overall fun greatly.

One of the key points I liked about in the first one the aliens where always trying to establish a base so the game could go on for ever (or until it ran out of memory). There was also something nice about having 3-5 battles at the same time and there was a chance you could win members back to the council (i think its been awhile). They also took out the base raids which where the most fun and the need to attack target carefully in this one you attack everything no matter what.

SGUFD, as it is known by fans, is rumoured to be one of the most difficult games of all time, with a full 88 keys assigned to various aspects of pitch and yaw for the sea-faring sections. You'll never look at a humpback whale quite the same way again! A literary classic, SGUFD is known to be highly prized amongst collectors of fan fiction, with a level of subtlety, terror and suspension-of-disbelief which is only matched by Independence Day, the movie. Unlike Blizzard's tepid original, Ubisoft's version ditches your favourite Starcraft characters, making up for it with lots of jump-scare shots, which incidentally later inspired the game 'Five Nights at Freddy's'. And Oh! What a stupendous ending - with at least 30 minutes of closure! (wait did I say 'minutes'?)

            "review_text": "XCOM follows in the steps of the UFO series and while it's upped graphics did inspire some, the whole system was lacking compared to its inspirations. Nonetheless, the turn based game play and challenging atmosphere on higher difficulties and ironman or the second wave options are a quite nice short term experience for two or three runs. And there lies the problem, this game wasn't designed to be as deep and long like the past games. That is why most see Enemy Within as the true continuation and it really feels empty without it. Yet for all achievement hunters, those two are handled like a split entity and you need to do it all over if you switch to the other. This is mostly a problem for the Cosmopolitan achievement where you need to win on all continents. In the worst case this means playing the game up to nine times. The base game has a distinct lack of maps Enemy Within repairs. And while it doesn't bring back base invasions as such, the aliens at least try it.  If there weren't the problems... the very terrible problems. Most of these are fixed in Enemy Within. And this I might add is the TERRIBLE problem. If you switch back to Enemy Unknown to grab achievements or play casual again, the things they fixed in Within, the crashes, are still there five years later. Patching that? Why care! This attitude is something I would never have expected from Firaxis. The games worst nightmare is overwatch. Overwatch will kill your game at one point, crashing it mid-mission. Especially without ironman, that can be a pain if you forgot to save again. And the battlescanner, despite being clearly overpowered here by working through closed doors sometimes just doesn't work. It does in Enemy Within, but there it triggers doors. Another long lasting companion even in Enemy Within is the UI bug. Sometimes it glitches out and if you are lucky you can get to save and exit and reload. If you are unlucky, you are stuck in a loop. I don't know where it comes from, but it is nasty. It actually kills the multiplayer... aside of lag. The multiplayer could be a quick sidenote, but instead it never took real flight and even friends struggle to play it 'in fun' together. If the UI doesn't crash your mission or the lag spikes relaod a move and count it twice, denying shot or overwatch, the game tilts. It is a chore...  So what can you say about XCOM?  Most of these bugs are outweight by the fun gameplay - for two or three runs - but the game lacks nearly everything. Longtime playability only comes with Enemy Within as it fixes all but the UI bug and with the Long War Mod, it becomes a great game.  If you plan on getting XCOM Enemy Unknown without Within, I would say DON'T! The denial of bug fixes in the base game is an INSULT. With Within it is fine.  So this review is neutral, I would say finish it if you like strategic round based games, roguelikes or a nice short story of aliens. Complete it only if you are a masochist. Either the five runs will crash often on Unknown or you need to do the same base and story run - much longer than Unknown - in Within.",

Voice acting can be a little cringe worthy at times for the two NPCs that help you but the soldiers themselves are pretty well done.

The only downside to this game is a few bugs. None of them are gamebreaking, so long as you have autosave on. Bugs include: - Fiddly free targeting: difficult to find and keep a range, especially when crossing elevations - Elevation: the elevation mechanics downright stink, with different levels flashing as you mouse over them in an eye-gouging fashion - Occasional crashes: Make sure to turn autosave on in the options. Occasionally a menu will freeze and you will have to load the game or restart the game entirely. Not frequent enough to be gamebreaking or even annoying, but it will happen once or twice. They could be the Joss Whedon to the Marvel universe.  That said, the game is well made, well voiced and scripted, and the scenario maintains a good level of challenge throughtout, even on normal difficulty. This is one of the best tactical combat engines out there, and I hope they license it out, or even bring in other IPs such as WarHammer 40K.

The turn-based strategy is very well done with an overall pretty good AI (though at times it really lacks AI :p)  I have given XCOM a couple of tries to play through on Iron Man (great feature I must say!), but each and every time, the AI beaten me to it, making it pretty much unable to continue and forcing me to start over. It was only yesterday (after a total of 80+ hours of playing) that I was finally able to complete the game. A good thing there is that every game felt like a totally different one compared to the other one. This also gives the game a high re-play value for me, which I think is very important as well.  An other good thing is the lack of overly many DLCs.

An example of this is you have moved all your guys but two, move one ahead and you see the enemys. They get to go into cover and the only way to shoot them is if somebody is in overwatch.

The story is uninspired, the characters are entirely insignificant and forgettable, the visual style is generic at best and the gameplay is solid but unremarkable and not particularily challenging. I have seldomly felt less enthusiastic about unlocking new tech for my squad, base, or individual soldiers in other games, and when one of them died or got severely injured before I got good medkits, the only emotion I felt was annoyance (mostly because that usually happened due to unforseeable circumstances, like not-previously-introduced mechanics/enemies, but also because the death-mechanic seemed unnecessarily punishing while adding little-to-no value gameplay-wise).  As I said, the gameplay is solid, and if you haven't played other (TB)S games before, this might be the bees knees, but I'm glad I got this game during a sale- it did not, for me, live up to other peoples' hype, and somehow managed to disappoint my non-existant expectations.

That would have made the game more challenginig and fun, but also rage inducing, but in a more fair way.  Aiming It works on a percentage based accurecy system, where the higher percentage gives you the higher chance of hitting a target and that is where most of my frustration comes from.

Obstructions You have your high walls and low walls, simple and they protect you depending on there the enemy is fireing at you, sure.... but when you or the enemy just straight shoot through the walls, no... thats not how cover works. Some times, the cover explodes, sometimes bullets ignore cover, most of the times, when you think you have a safe shot, you dont and it just breaks the logic of how things should work. Walls cant be trusted, especially when some walls explode and some dont.

            "review_text": "Do not be fooled. XCom is not a tactical strategy game. It is a random number generator disguised as a tactical strategy game. This means that there is no geuninuely fair challenge in the game, only dice rolls which determine the potential outcome of an action (much akin to Space Hulk), and the shockingly poor AI which either camps, suicidally rushes you, or completely ignores your soldiers in favor of killing civilians (on those oh so wonderfully designed terror attack missions).  This is par for the course for the UFO/XCom series of games, however this remake of the original is far crappier in every aspect. From the frequent game crashing glitches, to the teleporting enemies bug, to the horribly inept interface, to the constant and annoying computer control of the camera that slowly scrolls the screen to find whatever action is currently occuring, the game is a bevy of poor design choices, right down to the pointless base design.   One of the worst of these is the occulsion of vehicles and buildings (based on grid height) which is supposed to dynamically hide with wireframes, terrain blocking your vision for things like movement. It doesn't work. More often than not, it simply prevents you from clicking on where you want to go, mistaking your mouse hovering for wanting to look inside a building when you'd rather be on the roof, if you haven't mousewheeled out to the propert height.   Additionally, occlusion frequently hides vehicles your units might be standing next to, which have the inexplicable ability to catch fire and explode the very next round regardless of when it was set on fire. Did you just take cover behind a car, agro a group of enemies, and then on their turn they manage to light the car on fire? Congratulations, your soldier is now dead the second your turn begins. Alternatively, you may not even notice the vehicle has been lit on fire, becasue some vehicles are on fire by default and possess models identicle to the ones not on fire.  Range and accuracy seems to be another one of those wonderfully poorly designed mechanics, as closing ranks on an enemy unit doesn't always improve your characters supposed chance to hit. In fact, more often than not, getting closer to an enemy actually decreases your accuracy for some inexplicable reason not covered in the game. It could be moving then firing incurs a penalty, it could be a bug.  You will start the game being technologically and economically disadvantaged, as the alien invaders naturally posess better weapons than the lowly humans they're attempting to conquer, and will be required to research and build equipment and facilities in order to reach an equal footing. This simply boils down to figuring out how to deploy satilites (your primary weapon agains the alien onslaught) to maximum efficiency to ensure that you both gain money and reduce the panic levels in countries around the world. After figuring out out to manage satilites, the game becomes a trivial slog of repetative random missions (shoot down UFO, pacify UFO, halt terror attack) and once at maximum tech level, will see you continually fighting the same enemy units over and over, as they no longer have anything new to throw at you, just bigger numbers of their most powerful units, which are plagued by the same stupid AI.  Research and development is also entirely linear in the benefits of equipment it provides, providing no depth whatsoever with regards to improving on older equipment, or providing any sort of branching alternative (though given how RNG driven the game already is could be construed as a benefit as it quite easy to completely cripple your attempt to playthrough).  The Enemy Within DLC expands on both missions and enemy types (adding a few new ones in, primarily in the form of human enemies mimicing your own units) and adds in two alternate research options, geneic and cybernetic modifications, both of which add next to nothing towards the gameplay (similar to the psychic powers your units can obtain) as all three can only be unlocked 1/2 to 3/4s of the way through the game due to the afformentioned R&amp;D and construction requirements on facilities and tech.  Ultimately the game is at it's core, a rogue-like. No matter how careful your approach is, you will find no end to the manner of stupid and cheap events which occur, including poor map layouts and enemy/objective placements.  A waste of potential that suffers from far worse RNG than any of its predecessors ever did all in an effort to artificially induce difficulty. Skip it.",

This is the same regardless of difficulty you pick.  -Pointless Skill Tree's: Every skill selection is A or B, and you will be selecting the same crap every time anyways, since 50% of the skills are there as filler.  -Terrible replay value: if you complete the game on a normalish difficulty, it will have been by using the same 6 troops and 95-100% tech researched, the missions are randomly generated but ultimately the entire game feels incredibly linear with trigger points.

As such even though it can be a lot of fun, it also becomes quite annoying when you realise that you have very little real choices in trms of how to play it. This is doubly annoying when it's not apparent that you are *doing something critically wrong* until 4 hours later when you suddenly realise you are in a dead-end game scenario with no real way out, and you realise that you have to go back to a save you made ages ago to try to make the *right choice* this time; except that the *right choice* is not obvious until prior experience tells you so.  It also becomes clear after a while that the game's design predetermines certain things to happen, no matter what you do to try to prevent it.  I admit that I like games to have choices, allowing for player creativity and multiple ways to make various strategies work; X-com just does not allow for enough freedom of play: some of the ideas were very nice, but just were not implemented well enough to allow for enough possibilities. I was continually wanting to do things that were just not possible becasue of arbitrary restrictions and simplified mechanics.  Another crappy aspect seems to be that sheer luck seems to play such a big part in it too, you can get a string of right missions (that will give you the right rescources, and allow you to build the right things and allows you to control the Countries panic ratings), but you can just as easily get a string of missions that will give you effectively nothing and create a bad domino effect, and just screws things up so bad you end up in a state of impasse. Repeating the same missions over and over can get very tedius and severely destroys the game immersion imo.   The tactical part can be lots of fun, but with the rest of it being the way it is, just so often isn't an enjoyable playing experience overall.  Becasue of the games ridiculous rigidity, inflexibility and overly linear nature I just can not recommend it. This could be a very fun game that could be made so much better if there was a more sandbox+open ended gamelay aspect to it; a choice of missions that secured areas, rescources, tech, science so that you could strategically plan ahead and take control, and play it the way you want, instead of having to just *jump through the hoops* to get to each stage that the game expects of you.  Edit: I have been making myself play it to see if it gets any better, but no, the more I play it, the more I realise how screwed up it is: uncovering more and more critical failures in the game mechanics. I always really try to see a game through to the bitter end, even when its this messed up, but I am getting to the point where I have had enough; and its a shame because I really like certain parts of it. Very disapointed.",

There is hardly any strategic element to this game, its simply who is lucky and has their soldiers actually hit a shot first.

Base placement, radar coverage and range management on a planetary scale, full building demolition, proper incindiary characteristics from a battle perspective, using your engineers to provide saleable components to the world market at a profit. All of these things have just gone away, and been replaced by a simplistic interface, with a story line pushed ahead like it's on rails.  Soldier classifications was a waste of effort on the developer's part. In previous X-Com games, there was no specialization. People don't operate that way. They are all soldiers, mostly equally capable of doing the same things. Some have faster reaction or aim scores, but all of them can weild a rocket launcher or shotgun.   The true successor to the Xcom series is Xenonauts, and even that missed the mark.  If someone were to look for an uncomplicated game in the genre, I would point them towards the new Shadowrun series. It has most of the same elements, but doesn't adulterate any old franchises by removing much of the complexity of the system originally created.  I realize that I will never see a better version of X-Com: Apocalypse, and that really disappoints me.",

WTH is with this? is it just a random # generator to ever actually get more abductions? i thought i would be more pressured to setup of the 12 troops to split them in 3 platoons of 4, yet with that i NEVER had to not use the innitial 4 after the tutorial.  Idk seems like i got dealt a bad hand, or maybe need to figure out away to actually aquire more alien sightings to rush the available troops into combat...

Optional soldier voices, kill cam, etc. If you're a die hard x-com fan that believes this is blasphemy: don't play this game. Cause you'll never enjoy it. Let the rest of us enjoy this little gem.  While I didn't play too many of the original X-Com games, I did play the first one. This is no direct replacement for the old one, and definitely doesn't have the deep micromanagement that X-Com:UFO Defense had. What it does have are smaller squads (Think more like a kill team/seal team six) with abilities to round them out. It gives more meaning to individual soldiers and utilizing their abilities against a larger alien force. Imagine storming an alien battleship with six elite soldiers (if you're doing it right) armed with the proper gear and class abilities to work together as a cohesive group.   Another thing which I was worried about was map size. Welp, definitely not worried after doing my first playthrough (Classic difficulty, Ironman). The larger maps are rediclously huge, which makes me happy there were not as many soldiers being ordered about as it would take a long time to get done.  If you're looking for a remake, look to Xenonaughts (closer to a reskin and remake in an earlier time period, and which will be finished...sometime). If you're looking for one of the better X-COM games that is more a reimagining (and from what I understand comes closer to what Gallop wanted in the game) then give this a shot. The Demo doesn't do it justice, look for a sale or find a friend who'll let you give it a whirl. It is still a difficult game (Hell, I had to start over/quit and start a new game 10x because I made a tactical error or made a poor tactical decision, etc.) So don't go in thinking it'll be a cake walk.

The game also throws tons of fun gadgets, powers, perks at you as the game progresses, making you feel like you are being justly rewarded for your perserverance against the alien invasion.   I think part of what makes xcom's progression so fun is the fact that the upgrades you earn actually let you employ new strategies and change the way you play.. instead of just giving lame % modifiers all the time. For example, if you keep your soldiers alive over the course of your campaign, some of them will develop nearly superhuman skills. When augmented with some of the more advanced gear that you develop later, these troops will litterally dictate the way you play every mission, and their deaths will feel absolutely terrible, and make you want to tirumph even more.  That being said, the core game actually total trash...when compared to how good it is when combined with the ENEMY WITHIN expansion and LONGWAR mod. These two additions make the game INCREDIBLE. Every few months I feel compelled to come back and try out a new ironman playthrough... and get sucked in for 40+ hours.   To be honest XCOM enemy unknow, and especially 'Enemy within' are both pretty poorly paced and balanced, but the free longwar mod off xcom nexus fixes all of that. The game becomes essentially a desperate, tense, and extremely rewarding war simulation. The vanilla game is fun in its own right, but gives you too many powerful tools like mechanized suits too early in the game in a way that doest make too much sense.. and dont give the aliens enough of a numbers or technological advantage at endgame.   Anyways. Get this game. If you like sci-fi, if you like tactical games, if you like rouge-like punishment, if you like good games.. get xcom... and for god sake get enemy within and longwar, otherwise youd be wasting your money on this.",

A fantastic turn based strategy game that challenges your tactical decision making skills and your ability to adapt when things go wrong.

The game loses some steam near the end when your team becomes so powerful that the aliens cease to threaten you in most engagements, but that point usually comes near the end game anyway and the variant rules and higher difficulties will encourage you to play again and again. The Enemy Within expansion's use of Meld Countdown timers will force veteran players to juggle smart tactical play with aggressive advancement, and the Exalt missions present a unique switchup to the standard alien sweep and clear missions. Highly recommend for turn based tactical gaming fans, fans of the original XCom, or rogue-like genre fans.",

Bought it on the first day and didn't regret it, lived up to all the expectations. At first little things like the cover system made me uneasy as it was different mechanics than the original, but after playing it a few hours realized it was a good change. Xcom is my favorite game of all time, and I have enjoyed this remake very much I would highly recommend it both to players of the original and new players to the franchise.   That said everything has its cons, and this is what I didn't like very much about Enemy Unknown: - The base in it's new panel shape is not very good, I liked more the top down perspective form the original. I don't thinks it adds anything to the table, it actually takes away from the original. In the original Xcom you design your base and when aliens attacked it you actually fought in your own designed base with its pros and flaws.This was very fun and added a layer of entertainment when designing your base. In the new one you supposedly watch your crew do everything things, but really you never see anything and the visuals seem clumsy while navigating it. If there is something I could change from UO it's this. - I played the expansion game and after some 20 or 30 hours of gameplay the file corrupted and I lost all my progress. This is inexcusable, I just stopped playing after that as I have no guarantee that I will lose everything suddenly. - They took away some of the mystery and eerie atmosphere that made the original great. For example I don't think greys should move like monkeys, it makes me feel that they are not threatening at all (even though I think they took this decision for the very reason of making it feel more threatening, it had the opposite effect). This goes the same for the tall thin guys, they feel animalistic and personally I think a mysterious intelligent alien is much more scary and threatening than a guy that moves like a monkey. In the same vein the music isn't quite right.  Still with all these issues the game is great. Definetely worth buying it even full price.",

As I learned more about the title, I was more then elated to know the developers took the time to experience the original in order to be as faithful as they possibly could be and it definitely shows.   For the most part, Enemy Unknown stays very close to the original franchise. From the creation of the base to researching new alien life forms it's apparent that they didn't want to stray to far from the original formula but they have taken a few liberties.   Most of these changes happen at the combat level where fitting your crew members with extra accessories has been taken down significantly. With only two spaces regulated toward carrying things such as grenades and weapon enhancements, fitting your crew gets a bit tricky when deciding who gets to carry what.   Gone are the time units that determined movement, attack style, etc. Though there is still a cost in everything you do this process is a bit more streamlined and a lot more forgiving then in the past. Another interesting addition is the squad upgrades as members of your team receive not only extra attributes but soldier classes as well.   These upgrades involve special abilities like fire suppression, headshot, extra movement, and more. As your soldier continues to increase rank, more abilities become available. Another significant difference in this game is the amount of soldiers you can take on a mission. You are regulated to carrying just four soldiers to begin with and 6 total.    While originally I was happy with Enemy Unknown, I felt the DLC Enemy Within was the game that we really deserved. Enemy Unknown tried some new things but Enemy Within honestly set the franchise apart from it predecessor. Enemy within gave us new ground adding to it the ability to augment soldier abilities through gene or robotic development.   It also gave us a different type of threat one that will give players an even bigger challenge then what Enemy Unknown had to offer. I intently suggest anyone interested in checking out this title skip Enemy Unknown entirely and just play Enemy Within as they are both the same game when it comes to progression and story telling.   If you're just experiencing XCOM for the first time, then this is definitely a game I encourage you to play. If you've played the previous XCOM titles you'll be right at home with this next gen offering. While there is still a great deal of elements that are gone from the original, I honestly have no real complaints when it comes to this new offering and I'm just happy to see it come back and get the upgraded treatment that it deserves.",

You don't have to be familiar with the series to appreciate the concept - nutshelled as 'ALIENS WRECKING OUR STUFF KILL THEM TAKE THEIR STUFF STUDY IT TO KILL THEM BETTER' - and there's little pesky plot to get in the way of managing the crisis. In fact, 'crisis management' is probably a better name for this type of game, as it blends sim elements with turn-based strategy to deal with alien threats across the globe.  As hybrid games go, XCOM hits the sweet spot that makes it very easy to keep playing, regularly introducing new mechanics, toys, and threats to deal with. You'll feel the difference as you unlock new tech, and feel is the right word for it; it's immensely satisfying to start flinging lasers and UFOs right back at the enemy. Environments are destructible on a Silent Storm scale, meaning you can blast through a wall if doors and windows are inconvenient or too boring. Rockets and grenades become tools for the imaginative.  It's not always fair, even by hardcore standards, and I would caution against an Ironman run on your first time. There are too many bugs and interface glitches that can ruin your day in a single turn, sometimes by spawning actual bugs which kill your team then reanimate the corpses to kill the rest of your team. It's that kind of game.  Here's the bottom line. Do you like turn-based strategy? Do you enjoy advancing under overlapping cover, trying to coax foul Xenos into your carefully-arranged chokepoint? Do you dream of managing base construction so your power generators are linked for redundant bonuses? Can you live with occasionally fussy movement controls on multi-level missions?

You are probably going to enjoy this game. I didn't give it a perfect score for this group because if you play long enough, you will eventually wish that they had done more to make the game feel a little more complete. Until then, you'll probably enjoy dozens and dozens of hours of it, especially if you purchase the expansion, ENEMY WITHIN.  - If you are a casual gamer who does not enjoy tactics games, I would give this a 6/10.

            "review_text": "This game was based on the classic game of X-Com and has come back with new things that are good, and bad that many new and old fans have debated on about for close to 2 years. For this review I will not be telling you wether or not to buy this game, insted I would like you to take this information as what this game is about, and as good start or end to making your choice to buy this game, or not. I'm also puting this review in the postitive posts about the game because I would like more poeple to see that even thought steam has implamented this system for reviews, I feel that this positive and negitive reviews has only seperated the good from the bad reviews. I know that steam has the power to change this but, it would only be for the worse. However with out further extending this little review of steam's review system, I give you Xcom: Enemy Unknown.    The plot of Xcom Enemy Unknown is somewhat of a simple one. The game starts with the Alien attack on Earth and then Earth's UN create the Xcom project which is an elite taskforce that was created to combat the alien threat. You (the player) are a pointed as leader of the Xcom project and your job is to make sure that you can protect the human race from being wiped out by using the skills as a leader in battle and in construction and progress of the Xcom project. With that Xcom begins and then you move the plot along by doing sertain plot missions that advance the plot, like collecting Alien bodies, capturing Aliens alive, defeating Alien leaders, defeating Aliens that have attacked a major city, saving civilians, nations, and leaders of nations and lastly using your two most important teams to create/discover new weapons, armor, and important and relavent info on Alien combatants and new and better upgrades for your soilders. Sadly the plot itself has little to explain about the Aliens and more to say about the three charaters of its plot (that being its field commander who you will be for most of the game when in combat sections, the lead scientist who commands the expert team of scientists, and the lead engineer who is the only character that ever brings up serious questions, gives the game slight humor, and adds more character to the story more then the other two combined), and how the Aliens are more or less plain bullies to the human race for no reason. In any case the story hops from new discovery to defeating the main Alien base, and then new discovery, and new Alien threat, and so on untill you reach a point when you discover the main mother ship which contains the leader of all the Aliens. The story actully comes to a swift and quick close to the end when the story reveals the leader of the Alien forces, and gives that character little to no understanding of what they were or what their motive was. The story only ends with one of the most important soilders (that was required to get to that level by the way) sacrifice themself to save the world. In short the story is a short one, but unlike Portal which used many important points to get across what was going on, and alow things to be added on like Doug Rattmann's lairs and out of testing facility areas to create a better understanding of what kind of situation you were realy in. However this story doesn't do that insted it focuses on what the Aliens are doing and doesn't give enough chararcter and emotion into its own story to realy make you care about it.   The gameplay as guessed is a mimic of original X-Com's gamplay of turn based strategy combat with some new twists that are for the most part on the good side. First off the soilders that you are given are equipped with the basic tools of war (an assault rifle, a pistol, and a grenade) and for the start of the game this is ok. The amount of soilders you carry in to combat (without upgrades) is about 4 and you can upgrade this number to 6 by leveling your self up (more on that later). Now with the vastley decreased numbers you have compared to the previous X-Com, changes have been made to make sure that combat will not be unfair for you and your troops. For example a cover system has been created to protect your troops from on coming fire and has now prevented your troops from standing out in the open. These upgrades also alow your troops to move very fast around the battlefield, take more hits, deal more damage, give defensive protection, give them stealth, alow them to control the minds of enemy Aliens, and more. Now with all these upgrades does come a downside, and as you play this game you will realise that even with the great improvements that have been brought to the table it has been matched with its down sides, along with problems that can be made about its original to this that should have been rethought. First to start the upgrades that are given to you troops are thee most hardest things to come by because they need to be researched, then you need to gather the materials, and then pay for them on top of that. Now even though that doesn't sound hard keep in mind that these materials can only be gathered by Alien encounters and even though this would be acceptable if the game accommodated in a more fequent encounters, but it doesn't untill the half way point when the game floods you with a spike that doesn't leave untill you beat the game. With this it creates an unbalanced troops that are ether under armored, or under leveled by the Aliens that you are combating at that point of time. Now at this point this is where the game could be called unfair to any and all that play it, but that is were the battle saves come in and only soften the blow that this spike will have on your progress. You see these battle saves are just normal saves that you can do in battle. These saves can be extremely help full by alowing you to rewind to a point that you made a mistake and you could fix it, but during the begining of the game you will not use them because the game is fair enough for you to not want to use the battle saves, and the game does not tell you about them to begin with. This save is invaluable for the spike of the game, but can and/or will be unreliable, and thus this brings us to the biggest problems that this game sufers from.  To begin, the game (since its release) has come under the rightfull fire of bugs and glitchs that were mostly left in the game and thankfuly some were patched and we now have a some what cleaner game, but as any one who owns this game can tell you their are still bugs that can completely force you to restart everything, and make you lose progress (look at 'Reasons why we hate Xcom Enemy Unknown' for good refrence). Also a bugy game is not all you have to deal with; this game second fault is a gameplay feature that is the bane of the game's over all worth, the percentage system. The percentage system is a simple numbers system that caluclates the chances of your soilder hiting the Alien opponent. Percentages range from the regular 0% to 100% with 0% being no chance of hiting the target and 100% being that you are guaranteed to hit. This system is an aggravating experience to say the least becuase of how much the numbers that the game provides you are unreliable to begin with. Everyone who has played this game or has known about this game knows the infamous '99% miss' shot that will agravate the player to no end, but that joke is far more real then it seems. There has been more then a fair share of moments when the game has told me there was 79% to hit and it missed.    Unfortunately due to the lack of proper planing and time management that has been in this review of which I planed to only take an hour or 2, has now forced me to quit at up to 7 hours of typing. I would like to thank all who took time to read this and to thank a sertain search engine that helped me correct many of the simple mistakes that I have made. I know that I have alot more mistakes in here then I realise, but I hope you have found this review usefull. Sorry :(",

Yes, advance and overwatch does get a bit dull at times, but all it takes is a single Chryssalid and you will see the importance of being careful. Chryssalids are for me the worst enemies to run across, kill them quickly, thats the best advice i can give. :p   Other than that, it is a great game, if you like Turn-based strategy games, it is one of the better ones. If your curious about it, you can try the demo or watch many streamers on Twitch play it as well as a ton of films of it on Youtube.

The game style is the same including buildings. When intercepting a UFO you cannot pick the different type of stands for the aircraft, but you can upgrade weaponary.    Now, for the people who never played this game. Still a good game to pickup but will have a little learning curve. This game combines simulation game with a Turn-Based Strategy (or TBS) and a little dog fighting in the air. The battles are turn base so it plays like a chess match. When you are not fighting, you are upgrading your building/soldiers/planes/tech/etc. to help you in the next fight.   Overall the gameplay is smooth and does not seem choppy, The story is not the best, maybe with more believible voice actors I could get into the game. The replay value for the game is high. In order to get all the achievements you would have to beat the game at all starting Continents. I wouldn't pay more than $60, but even $45-$50 would be a good deal due to replay value plus some DLC.",

Aswell as having these basic missions you get terror missions (which you will soon learn to hate) where you need to go deep into a city and rescue some civillians whilst fighting of aliens who will be killing off the civillians, and the more civillians you save the more panic is decreased. You will also retrieve missions from the council (which i think is basically the in game NATO) where you usually just need to find a V.I.P and return him to your ship safely whilst fighting off lots of aliens.  Throughout the game you encounter lots of different and unique aliens ranging from the basic puny sectoid to the fearsome muton and the ♥♥♥♥ing satan of xcom - the chryssaids. theyre all different some can mind control some have tons of health and some can turn people into zombies. During the game depending on how you play you will recieve different things on missions as well as the standard weapon particles,alloys and alien corpses you can use to research and build new items.

Your fighting intelligent aliens, so the better the equipement, the better the chance you have of surviving. A very cool sort-of reboot that I would highly suggest to any alien or strategy fan.

If that's what you wanted, don't buy this game and please don't bother us by giving 0 point reviews here.  As I said, this game is different from UFO: EU(X-com: UFO Defence in america) it is however not worse or dumbed down. They may have simplified the tactical combat, but simplifying is not the same as dumbing down. Dumbing down is making the game easier and losing strategic depth in the process, simpifying is making a game easier to understand while trying to maintain or improve strategical depth.   And XCOM: EU does the latter. The strategic base management is probably even more complicated than it was in the original and the tactical combat is, while streamlined and symplified, just as deep or even deeper than the original game.  It now involves units working together instead of having 14 nearly identical soldiers just scouting if every direction. Ammo is now more important unlike what many 1993 fanboys are saying. Guns still need reloading you just don't need to equip your soldiers with ammo anymore. And most of all there's the completely new cover system. Now, when you move your soldiers, you actually need to think about flanking aliens, because shooting aliens in full cover isn't going to kill them. I've come across a situation where my assault soldier tried to flank an alien but revealed another alien in the process which left him exposed. I then moved my support soldier in to throw a smoke grenade to protect my assault and used my heavy to suppress the flanking alien to avoid him shooting at my assault... Tactical situations like that would almost never occur in the original X-com so i completely disagree wit people who say this game is dumbed down.   The things that were simplified are mainly things like Time Units and i think the new system is actually better. It might kill the nostalgia a bit but this system is faster, easier and makes every decision more important and rewarding.",

Not with the button to accept, or the escape key. Couldn't anything. Alt+Tabbed out, to see if the game was just unresponsive according to task manager. It was. Restarted PC. Loaded game. Same issue with that dude, but at least the first time I got a single turn out of him after blowing up the aliens with a rocket. That was cool. Thought 'I better save before I try and make any turn at all, who knows when the game will glitch out again.' so I did. That's when the game stunned. Forced it off through task manager. Loaded.

The game gives you allot of room to decide on your play style or allows you to adapt styles as situations unfold.  What I remember from when I first got the is it can be extremely challenging at first especially if you are a perfectionist however you quickly adapt over time and now in later game stages especially you can develop a style that can be unstoppable.  The expansions are great in that they add variety to the missions to keep it fresh although this may cause you to spend more time than you should playing.  I recommend the elite solders pack it allows them to look allot more polished in many areas and allows you to define your own look and feel for them. totally is worth it for the this is my squad effect.  One down to this dlc though is it can be a bit monotonous fitting each new recruit and as from time of writing when a soldier is injured the deco value will reset to default and you will have to go in and do a simple switch to the deco type you like.  Game play has allot of tactical aspects to it and with unit variety, skill sets and equipment bring many variables to be considered on the battlefield.  A typical mistake for me as a beginner was rushing solders into enemy fire or clumping up in a group and being hit with a grenade.  All in all fantastic game for its tactical system and game play, story immersion and detail given to customizing the squad and giving them quirks and characteristics that can make them memorable like my Greek sniper who was code named Zeus and had phsyonic abilities.",

The mechanics in this game are very interesting, your people you control can get scared and if they do they either: a) blindly shoot at enemies b) run away c) find cover somewhere else and they can't fight the next turn meaning you have to find a way to save them with your other members.  I have this one character I favour most which is my sniper, she's amazing the damage she does with a plasma sniper rifle, it's like watching mozart play his master pieces. I don't personally think I could ever rate this game further then anyone else has but if you love RTS and you enjoy turn based games with real depth to it by all means please buy this you will not regret this purchase. Even if your curious about this type of genre or game just buy it you'd be surprised how much fun you will have with it.  *edit*  Updated review after finishing the game...wow all I have to say is this game was outstanding, the ending...I wasn't ready probably because I was invested so much into the game but it was too much for me. I really can't wait to play Xcom 2 when it comes out I'll definitely be keeping this game on my PC to play people online and play again doing things better.  I give this game very high raitings",

I tried to start playing in 2013 then stopped; I tried again in 2014 and faultered again. I gave XCOM a proper go in 2015 and am glad I did.   XCOM:EU is fantastic.  It is a really fun blend of base management and small scale tactical battles. All the soldiers are named and even on easy can die very swiftly due to poor decisions made or just plain bad luck. Similarly on the management side if you don't appease the various countries funding you, they can and will bail on you and withdraw their funding.  This abundance of consequences is what really *makes* XCOM as a game and for a novice like me, the lower difficulty setting allows that 'feel' while not being off-puttingly hard.  The game also feels polished, in terms of visuals, sound and general aesthetics.  I would recommend this game to anyone - especially if on sale.",

Voice acting is good too, nothing special, but better than a lot I've seen.  Enemies are fun, and each one requires a different tactic (to a degree) FIghting sectoids? Look out for that mind merge.

Pro: -Many choices and options in game play. -Poor choices in research can really bite you in the butt. -Mods have opened a door to better game play and options. -Many new things added that are really nice. (Even more with the X-Packs) -Controls are smooth and easy to learn. -Analog Controller friendly. (Big Plus on this type of game) -Better looking and art work. -The voice overs are not bad and the acting is passable/fair. (Nothing like bad acting in a game like this to kill it for you) -You will be looking forward to new Mods as well as new X-Packs. -The Mechs and Psi abilities really can be a game changer. (Plan how many of each you want) -Loads of fun.  Con: -Enemy Unknown comes with very few maps and can feel repetitive due to that.(Enemy Within fixes this issue) -The default game seems to move way to fast and can be over in less than 20 hours of play.(Can be fixed with Mod 'The Long War'-Ups game play to 100+ hours) -It seems that the percent amounts of chance to hit are just for decoration. Even when your troops reads 90% chance to hit it really means nothing. You will miss more times than you should with 90%+ accuracy. (Personally I find it funny that 'The Best We Have To Offer' miss so often at high % shots)  I am an old schooler who played the original Xcom and loved it. So yes I miss some things from the old game but the new things make up for it in so many ways.  I do recommend this game but again I will say that the Mod 'The Long War' is a must to really feel a bit of a challenge.",

I'm not one of those types to get to the end and beat it as quickly as possible - I drag things on, get a good group of experienced soldiers, etc. In one game, I actually had a group of soldiers with kill counts in the 900s. That should give you an idea of how long I like to play a game!  Ultimately though, even on Impossible Iron Man Mode (hardest difficulty, only one save), I could get through the game with hardly any losses at all. When the expansion dropped, I beat the entire thing in IIMM in one sitting. After you play the game for 50 or so hours, you start to understand the patterns of how the aliens function in battle. It becomes all too easy to lure them 1-2 at a time into a kill squad, without your guys taking a single hit. There are also various glitches (I'll let you figure them out) that make the battles completely one-sided - certain angles that really give you the advantage, for example.  Then, I discovered 'The Long War'. It's a mod on Nexus that breathes new life into this game, and boy does it. I tried doing an IIMM run in Long War, and got my rump handed to me! I've since logged another 100+ hours in TLW, and am still playing new games in it. I highly recommend installing this mod!  Being a veteran of the original X-Com games isn't a requirement. The gameplay is completely different, and nothing in this game assumes that you've played the pervious. As a veteran of the first, I can still highly recommend this game. I'll be playing it all the way up until the day the second one launches!",

Essentially, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a turn-based battlefield tactics/base management game, where you command a small group of elite military operatives against an invading alien force, killing the attackers, rescuing civilians, and blowing things to Hell and back.   What's good?   Pretty much everything. With the exceptions of a few flaws I'll get to later, almost everything about this game is brilliant. The two main gameplay elements, turn-based military strategy and base managment, both work well, each standing up on their own two feet, but combining together in a brilliant way. What you do in your base affects your troops in the field, and vice-versa, so the game really rewards you for clever tactics and strategy in both areas. The graphics, while less than perfect, are as good as they need to be, and since the joy of this game comes less from spectacle and more from the reward of good strategy, the lower-end graphics don't let the game down.   The combat system works beautifully, and while there's random number generation to keep it tense, you have enough control over the shooting that you never feel like it's completely up in the air (unless you're playing badly). The four classes are unique enough in their own ways to each be highly useful in battle, and this game has one of the greatest modding communities I've seen in years. This game is phenomenal, and if you enjoy more thinky, strategic games, you should absolutely pick up not just the base game, but the DLC as well.   What's bad?  As much as I like this game, there's a few things that bug me a little bit. Some of these are extremely subjective, though, so take them with huge amounts of salt, as they may not bother you in the same way they bother me.   Most of the choices in this game are either absolutely pointless, or ridiculously contrived. Let me give you an example. At random times in the game, aliens will invade and attack three different cities. Panic will rise in the countries they attack, and I can only defend one of the cities. WHY? I have 20 troops twiddling their thumbs back at the base while 4 of my soldiers go to defend one of the cities, so why can't I go and take care of the others?   From the other end of the spectrum, you spend a portion of the game upgrading weapons and armor for your troops. But the issue I have with this is that any new weapons you get will always be better than your old weapons in every single way. You go from ballistic to beam to plasma, but plasma guns will always shoot more accurately and do more damage than beam weapons, no matter what. Personally, I would have liked a bit more of a difficult decision in what weapons to equip my troops with, but that's just me.   All that being said, these issues were fixed in an absolutely beautiful mod called 'Long War', but since this mod is also extremely difficult, you'll need to do at least a couple playthroughs of the vanilla game before moving up.   Don't take away that XCOM is bad, because it's absolutely amazing, and between the time I've spent playing on here and on my old Xbox, it's easily one of my most played games of all time. There are a couple issues, yes, but they can be fixed when you're good enough to handle Long War and even before that, they're never dealbreakers. Please get this game, you owe it to yourself.",

For a fan of turn-based strategy games this is (in my honest opinion) a must-buy. Back to my original statement; this game will do anything it can to screw you over. You WILL miss important shots, enemies WILL hit dangerous shots, the game WILL introduce enemies at horrible times, it WILL put your best units in the sickbed when you need them. This game loves to taste your salt, be it through tears or ragequits. But beating a mission without anyone dying after the game seemingly did everything in its power to kill them all is really satisfying. I recommend starting on easy, even if you're familiar with turn-based strategy games. You don't want to be too horribly screwed by the enemies before you know anything about them.  -Good things- Unit classes which are all varied with different skills to bring, really fun to play around with some skill sets and combos. Winning a map can be very satisfying. Bit of base management which is good for relieving the stress combat brings. Solid replayability (coming partly from something I'll get to). You can customize your units' appearance.  -Bad things- The base game has a tendancy to break, at some points the game simply froze with nothing to do but close it and load a save (if available), I have not encountered this (to my memory) with the expansion. When you run out of money or other resources for the base building there's nothing active you can do, all you can do is wait for something to happen. Some enemies can ruin your day by just showing up on the map, being most of the later enemies (Floater being the first to come to mind), this can work to the game's advantage with replayability though: many times that I start a new game is because I miss the pre-Sectopod period.  I also recommend getting Enemy Within: the aliens it adds are a bit weak, but everything else it adds makes it worth every penny.",

The moment you sneak up on aliens they get free actions to just run off into cover and safety, while when they stumble upon your characters, or on occasion Drop right into the middle of them with the slendermen wannabes, you just have to sit there and take it up the ♥♥♥ while they wipe out your squad, no matter how well dug in and carefully equipped.  You get two actions. Move and shoot. Or Move and move. and If, just if your the right class, shoot, then move. or move, and move, then shoot. But its likely going to end the same way, you spot an alien, they dive into cover, and you can either take wild shots with no accuracy, or run up really close and get killed in the enemy phase.  The expansion doesnt give much better, the mecs look awesome, and work awesome, genemods, all of that. But it just doesnt make it worth it. Ok, maybe it does if your a hardcore one who likes overly difficult games, where the deck is so stacked against you the game is always going to have a pair of aces in hand, go for it. And there are mods that... Balance? it, Long war, the game is a more balanced difficult, and alot mor enjoyable with it making alot more sense, but in the end, i cant suggest it. even when i win a long hard battle there isnt any satisfaction, just a resigned sigh and the strong urge to just play something else.",

EU also includes a great multiplayer that allows for public, private &amp; LAN matches. Multiplayer works great with practically ANY internet connection including satellite. You can easily sink hours into the campaign alone and once you get into multiplayer it robs you even more. One nagging thing with the multiplayer is that it could bug out sometimes such as being unable to move units although it can be solved. For the most part, a solid addition to the X-COM franchise. I look forward to playing the second one which is set to come out in November of 2015.",

Now I have a pretty strong grasp on the mechanics and flow of the game.   Having a soldier die isn't really that big of a deal since a rookies gains rank pretty quick. All I do is deck my soldiers out in the best armor and weapons. More firepower is better than less.

Enemy Within is pretty neat, adds a few extra things but wouldn't necessarily say it's like a whole new game, just that it makes the game a bit denser. It adds a new mission arc, new mission types to go along with the story, a new alien race and the ability to mod your soldiers cybernetically or genetically. The ♥♥♥♥ off factor comes in the way the camera works, you can only see at one of 4 angles and it makes it a bit tough to navigate/see what is going on. When there is a second story it can be VERY difficult to select where you want to move, it may look like you are selecting a tile on the second floor but its actually the first floor and your soldier very well may just run out into a middle of aliens and die. Another way this game can ♥♥♥♥ you off is when you miss three times with a 89% hit chance, granted you can't hit everytime but it can get frustrating when you run out of cover towards an alien to deliver the final blow and miss or only do 1 point of damage and die the next turn. As long as you aren't playing in Ironman mode, then this won't bother you that much since you can just reload your save. If you can get past those obnoxious mechanics, then the game is very challenging and fun. Worth checking out if it's $20 or below and you enjoyed games like civ and fallout.",

Teach him Rapid Fire so you can laugh while he decimates aliens up close. Want more map control? Teach him Flush and he can shoot at enemy cover forcing them to run the ♥♥♥♥♥es they are! But you can only have one or the other since both skills are presented at the rank Lieutenant)  -You can literally make your dream team with the character customization (I made a Mr. T clone before he got destroyed by some big guys)  -Armor diversity is good (Cloaking, jetpacks, and mechsuits oh my!)  -The dead stay dead   Cons-  -The dead stay dead  -The interface with moving your units can be tricky at first  -Civilians like to get killed before you can save them  -Lack of weapon diversity (New weapons researched just offer more damage. They could have added more weapons that could allow for more strategies instead of just flanking and hiding behind cars that can explode)   CONCLUSION- Go buy it now you cheapskate",

            "review_text": "I've been playing the first UFO back in 1994 and loved the approach in mixing resource management strategy with a tactics game. What put me off were the frequent and rather long battles, coupled with an input system that drove you nuts, especially when you had to switch between levels. At some point I had to give up. because it wasn't fun to fight 20 battles without having any idea if the game is actually progressing or not.  The remake did adress all the aforementioned problems. You actually have a steady game progression wich is tied to the narration of the plot. Controls are intuitive and allow a flawless execution of your ideas.  There are a few things left wanting, though. The difficulty ranges between stupidly easy and deadlock situations, in which you save and load over and over to have the lucky roll you need to survive the first enemy initiatve attack. But most of the time it is sufficient to advance slowly in a coherent fire line to blow the enemies to pieces. But well, I could live with that, although I didn't really feel like having to worry about tactics too much.  Another tings is the missed opportunity to add some personality to your squad members. They are just some exchangeable, generic action figures without any personal background, distinctive traits or anytihng else that would make you feel care about their fate. But then, I'm still waiting for a worthy successor for Jagged Alliance 2, so I guess that's too much to wish for atm.  Recommended for fans of the old X-COM games. Die hard fans of tactic games might be disappointed by the rather simple combat gameplay.  Wait for a sale like I did, then try it out. I for my part probably won't replay it, I didn't even feel motivated to continue with the addon.",

Aliens begin to appear the same as once you've seen em all you've seen em all. Adding some kind of random build to the alien would have made it better. Making it like you never know what you will encounter would have made it better.   More skins more fun. I got so sick of seeing the same characters in the same suits and not much to change things. That certain armor and certain weapons were it and all you'd ever get kinda made me sad.  One of the greatest things about Xcom Terror from the Deep is I never felt like I was playing the same exact place twice. Oh sure the missions were the same but the exploration of them was different. I can almost tell you where every alien is in each mission now. Plus the direction signal gives them away also. ;)  The air combat is pretty lame and once you get the dodge upgrade and one demon fighter ship it's all she wrote. I haven't lost a battle in the sky ever. Even without the demon and dodge. I had more fun with the subs in Terror from the Deep.  Plus there are no base attacks on the humans in this one. THat made Terror from the Deep exciting also. To have to worry not only about your characters but also your sub bases made the game a lot more fun.  All n all it's pretty fun but looking at Xcom 2 it's turning into silliness now with geurilla warfare and snakehead aliens and gasp swords!! lol Xcom meet Alien Creed. :)  ENEMY WITHIN on the other hand is a piece of crap. Missions where it's impossible to save everyone and you have to pick which ones you are going to sacrifice for the betterment of mankind. Ludicrous spam of alien creatures in some missions that you just can't keep up eliminating and reloading too. I wouldn't recommend it to my monther in law. :)",

To live despite the odds even knowing full well that casualties will occur at some point. So I end up restarting to see if I could have made a better team. The tech tree is engaging, you'll feel like its something you want to break open all the way but the time frame will prevent that. The scenarios feel well executed with a nice list of bad guys getting tougher with success. Its loads of fun and good strategy and the gripe I have is based on extreme luck. It's not entirely clear sometimes if the cover I have taken protects me in the diagonals or if I'm open to alien attack. My well trained squad can sometimes be unbelievably unlucky in taking shots or getting shot even after popping smoke and taking cover.

Lots of time and experience (think the King of Strategy: Sid Meir) went into this game, and while there are some visual bugs, it's quite pretty and eery at times (although the envirorments are not continent-specific whatsover; sometimes you kind of chuckle when you're dropped into a jungle in the middle of Egypt). It's also hard; really, really flippin' hard. I would venture to say that in my short span of gaming, this is the hardest game I've played. I'm a casual gamer, granted, but this game...it has infuriated me beyond any other game I've played. It's fun! Really, it's a 'one more turn/one more match/holy crap it's four AM' kind of game, and the story line really makes you push yourself (sometimes too quickly) to advance. But it's really hard. Now, I actually DO recommend this game - to gamers really good at strategy and tactics (AKA NOT ME). But for the casual gamer who has maybe five hours a week max to sit down and game, this is NOT the game to play. It's honestly ruined a few nights for me because I've had to keep restarting to beat one level - and that's on easy. Okay, so odds are I suck (95% sure of that). But that doesn't mean I'm wrong. That's also one of the beautiful things of the game, especially when you put Ironman mode on (automatic saves, perma-deaths). It really makes you take ever turn, every decision, every research and engineering project seriously. But it's just really flippin' hard, and as a gamer who wants to be slightly challenged, not frustrated, and experience a good story line, this game doesn't do it. Also, it’s hard in some dumb ways - your guys are gonna miss A LOT of seemingly-super easy shots, only to get murdered the next round. So, summed up: it's a great game, even two years later - but it's hard, and while I got it for free via a promotion, I would never spend actual money on this game that has visibly upset me for a good few days now. If you feel up to it, by all means go for it. You might find it worth it. As for me, I'm shelfing it and moving on.",

A UFO had landed there, and brought with it a full contingent of alien troopers. The battle raged from the landing zone all the way to the UFO itself. An injured Muton retreated inside the UFO whilst my elite warriors mopped up the remaining survivors in the treeline.  Wave after wave of Xray scum crashed against my troops, trying desperately to resist, but they were no match for the advanced tactics of my troops. We pressed onward, seizing the interior of the alien craft itself, until we cornered the wounded muton. FIghting back with the terrible savagery of a cornered bear, he lobbed plasma shell after plasma shell onto my troops.   It was as though he knew I had yet to capture a live specimen of his species for study.   Through the use of smoke grenades and first aid I was able to recuperate the damage he had dealt to my warriors' minds and bodies. It would not be easy to subdue this beast, but a plan was devised. The majority of the squad would cover the hallway so that he could not retreat further into his ship. Two soldiers, one carrying the super-taser device and the other carrying a rocket launcher went around the outside. a hole would be blasted in the side of the ship, allowing for the quick subjugation of this fierce, elusive creature.  The soldiers took their positions.  The rocket was fired.  Through the fiery smoke and debris the brave soldier rushed in.  The beast turned around, angry and startled.  The device fired, sending a concentrated burst of electricity into the behemoth's body.  Stun failed.  Why RNGesus. Why.",

I like XCom, don't get me wrong (and am looking forward to XCom 2) but I didn't like the Long War mod, one bit and it's a shame because it adds so much to it.  Xcom Enemy Unknown: 7/10, a pretty good games, which has a few gliches here and there but nothing breaking, although I'd given up on iron man matches because the occasional gliches can kill an entire game, when it forces a reload and loops.  Xcom Enemy Within: 9/10, just love the additional content, which adds so much to the original. The cynic in me wonders why the hell this wasn't shipped with the original if not to screw more dollars out the player ffs but I'll ignore it and put it down to a hard-working team, who continued to work on it after release and took the uncomfortable decision to put a price on it because of the amount of work that went into it.  Long War: 6/10. Now I know this is a free mod and I'm not stamping my feet or anything like that, I'm just simply saying that overall, after some time playing it, I felt that the minuses considerably outweighed the plusses. Don't get me wrong, I liked the additional difficulty and improved tactical play of the aliens, the more technical outlook of air combat, research and basically the whole approach to the game. What I didn't like and this is the game breaker for me - one-on-one, for the most part, the aliens will hit you more than you hit them in a straight-up gun-line firefight, which forces you to try to outflank and collapse their line. This is all well and good and I had no problem with that but the fact that you are considerably outnumbered and the operational theatre is quite small results in your outflanking force being outflanked purely because there isn't enough room in the OT to accommodate your outlfanking without running into another pack of aliens who are on a guard loop. You are therefore forced to just try your luck, which will have cataclismic consequences if your outflankers hit another squad or ride out the gun-line fight and accept the casualties and hope your squad doesn't get ground down before your clear out the level. Shame really.",

I run this game with an I7 second gen PC, It was the last system that GATWAY produced expressly as a game machine, back in 2011... It now has 16 gig of ram, and a 2G NVIDIA GTX660 video card, along with a CORSAIR high end power supply. The Witcher 3 runs at the top setting with no stutter on this system, and it never gets hot, but I do run only one LCD TV 32 INCH screen at 1360x768... Absolutely no pixlation, and always great live sense of realism... I'm pretty sure two more side screens of same size could run at the same of 1024 resolution, if I wanted wrap around for space games etc... That said, to start with this game gives well defined objectives, teches the player how to use its component parts strategically, and tactically. With the way I run my system, as earlier described, there is no bogging down of any part of the graphics, that would lead to the loss of missions, due to visual stutter, and misdirection of resources as a result. Also the training mode is very positive and encourages the player by complementing their decisions, which build confidence, and self relience... This helps almost any player I've talked to gain self relience quickly, and develope mission decision making profisciency very quickly, and seems to be a very good teaching technique. Not everyone will agree I'm sure, but so far, I see little or no falts with the game in whole, and although I'm really a newby at it, I think this early positive experience will be the indicator of what is to come for probably the whole game, unless, there is some hidden issue later on, that I have not yet encountered. I do recommend a BELKIN N52te type control pad, to use for commanding your group, and woul definitly print out and display the commands programmed into it, because this game is command-rich in choices of action for each team member you have, and proper setup for quick selection and easy use of all actions availible will be key to getting your most enjoyable stategic experience out of this X-COM game. I will add to this as I progress, and list any new idea's etc... Hope this initial encouter startout related rating helps you ! Enjoy :-)",

For those familiar with the X-COM series, this installment definitely takes a more player-friendly approach when it comes to difficulty than the classic X-COM games. Beware though, overly ambitious playing style is usually punished. And sometimes luck simply turns against you. But in general it feels a lot more fair than the classics.  I would have liked the base management a litle more fleshed out and some of the encounters felt repetetive after a while (UFO crash landed, go in and kill the same old enemies over and over). But this is nothing that gets in the way of the sense of achievement when gloriously taking out a large group of heavily armed foes by well thought out tactics and returning home without a scratch. The game does a great job at creating a challenge by limiting the player's resources and options in a smart way. Do you buy those new rifles or save up for better satelite coverage?   If you don't own this game and gunning down some aliens by using your brain over your reflexes sounds like your cup of tea, go ahead and buy it already. It's really as good as they say. If you prefer fast paced RTS, shooters or highly complex simulations, this is probably not your game.",

X-COM Enemy Unknown is a really, really good game.   I'm not going to go into specific features, there are plenty of videos on YouTube which can show you better than I can explain them but in a nutshell:  This game is a tactical, turn-based squad combat strategy game with an overlayed level of base building and managment. These two seemingly disperate features compliment each other very well.   X-COM EU is also a very difficult game, if you like having to really work for your victories then this game might just be for you.  I'm writing this review now because I'm seeing the game reduced fairly often and to pretty reasonable prices. With the sequel out early next year, this is a great time to grab X-COM EU if you have never played it.   On a final note. Enemy Within is a large expansion to the game with adds a lot of really good content. If you have the extra little bit of cash, I'd recommend grabbing the complete edition. ",

            "review_text": "ayyliums get free turns when spotted, every time anyone does anything there's a horribly long animation to watch, cover doesn't actually do anything tangible, and you will miss pretty much every shot you try to make while the enemy will almost never miss theirs in the early game. in the late game, the reverse is true; you have armor and perks that completely negate anything's chance to be a threat anymore, and the enemies actually lose things they had earlier in the game that were so threatening.  actually very much unlike the original in terms of difficulty since it's not so much hyper-lethal on all sides and generally unforgiving as it just outright cheats and all your decisions are utterly meaningless, assuming the game isn't too busy with the same animation you've seen a hundred times to respond to your keyboard inputs  it's riddled with bugs and design issues. so far I've encountered: * Object hiding is completely insane and basically doesn't work. Sloped roofs never hide. Multiple-floor buildings generally hide all at once if there's objects of interest on more than one floor, making it difficult to manage soldiers on different elevations.  * Grenade/Rocket HUD does not accurately show what environmental objects will be hit and destroyed.  * Characters can move into or out of grenade/rocket explosions in real time, because it's based on real radius and not tiles occupied. Thus, depending on what animation a character is doing, they can dodge an explosion that should have hit or be hit by an explosion they were clear of a literal second ago.  * 'Missed' shots can still pass hit characters, complete with blood effects. At least it doesn't do damage!  * 100% to-hit shots can still be missed if they somehow don't connect with the enemy in question. This will fail to do damage.  * The skyranger sometimes just doesn't land at XCom HQ. It'll be shown moving on the geoscape world map, but the game will be soft-locked at this point and you have to Alt-F4. (The pause menu is not usable.)  * Combat Stims straight up do not work. Item is not depleted when used, and does not confer any benefits when used. It still takes a round-ending action to try, though.  * VIPs in escort missions can be killed before you have control of them. This is hopefully unintended behaviour.  * Soemtimes, escort missions will give control over civilians who aren't the VIP to escort. If these civilians die, the mission will fail. They are not targeted if you don't have control over them, but aliens will try to kill them if you do have control. (Oddly enough, they count as VIPs and will end the mission if you escort a body guard or generic soldier to the escape zone instead of the prescribed VIP.)  * Enemy groups don't move on lines, and just teleport from point to point. Because of this, enemy groups can teleport to closer range than where the fog ends, making for bizarre overwatch behaviours and easy flanking/point blank shots for them after being activated if you don't kill the whole group immediately.  * Enemy groups can activate such that one or more members of the group will phase through a wall. Occasionally, they will phase into normally inaccessable areas, such as the insides of shipping containers or closed rooms without doors/windows. In these cases, if you don't have explosives, the mission is effectively impossible to complete as the alien cannot leave the space and you cannot breach it to kill the alien.  * Enemy airdropped troops can land directly inside your soldiers. Oddly, shots on aliens that are occupying the same tile as you are counted as being pretty far away (but not infinitely far) and will generally have a mediocre aim chance instead of the 100% you usually get from point-blank shots.  * Destroyed cover objects generate fog of war where they were. This fog takes real time to clear; a shot that seemingly broke LOS by interfering with peeking behaviour on full-cover objects usually just made the game confused, and not doing anything for a minute or two of real time will bring the alien back into view. When this happens on alien turns, the enemy stops moving until the glitched fog clears.  * Enemies in cover who have their cover destroyed often retain the cover state they were last in when the cover was destroyed for several real-time moments, similar to above.  * Overwatch shots made by aliens have a tendency to make the camera linger on nothing of note. May also be related to above.  * Soldiers may have the HUD note that they can see an alien, but trying to select 'Fire' or any similar action says that there is nothing in range. Sometimes waiting real time will fix the problem and make the supposedly seen alien able to be fired upon, but not every time.  * Left-clicking a door occasionally causes the soldier to charge through the door and stand in the doorframe instead of quietly opening the door from the side.  *The perk Rapid Reaction sometimes fails, and the Heavy will not get a second reaction fire opportunity despite hitting the first overwatch shot on an approaching enemy.  * Putting a SHIV in front of a door breaks the door forever, and makes each tile on boths sides of the door impassable terrain.  * Open doors sometimes become impassable terrain when loading a save made during a mission.  * Fire occasionally clears or spreads in the middle of a turn, making a space impassible one moment and passable again the next.  * Thin Man poison generates on the corpse in real space much like explosions, with many of the same bugs. Women are better at not getting poisoned just because their models are smaller so they have less of a chance of being hit by a random particle!  * Dense Smoke is insanely GPU-taxing for no clear reason. Several normal smokes in the same space run fine, but a single Dense Smoke tanks the framerate. Oddly, Combat Drugs smoke is less taxing than normal smoke despite having more particles to draw (it includes blue flakes in addition to the normal smoke)  * Hitting a Muton Berserker and causing it to move on the player turn makes the game stutter very severely for no clear reason.  * Berserkers rarely trigger Close Combat Specialist's free Overwatch strike, but sometimes do. Seems to do with their intent to melee.  * Close Combat Specialist can trigger multiple times. It also triggers when movement begins within the 4 tile radius, such as an enemy panicking and attempting to flee from your CCS-having soldier. Not sure if that's intended.  * Skeleton Suit and Ghost Armor grappling sometimes fails. The action is spent and the animation plays, but the charcater then teleport to their original position and the tile they attempted to grapple to becomes impassable terrain for the remainder of the round. If this triggers on the last action of the turn, the soldier gets a 'free' actions back (though the HUD won't show a pip denoting the action is available), but if it was the first action, it is completely wasted. Soldiers who can fire without spending an action (e.g. In The Zone sniping, activating Run&amp;Gun, etc) can do so normally before doing anything that would consume the action.  * Cars and other explosive objects can catch fire and explode, and then be set aflame again and explode again even though they've already exploded.  * Overwatch sometimes fails, leaving the soldier unable to use any abilities (including basic Fire, Hunker Down, etc.) but somehow retaining actions. They can move, but not do anything else.  * Overwatch sometimes fails, consuming the action and leaving the soldier supposedly in overwatch, but aliens can run directly across their view and the soldier will not even attempt a reaction shot.  *Starting the game without an audio device installed and active (i.e. your headphones/speakers are unplugged or off for whatever reason) will cause the game to never have audio for that session.  And that's just the bugs.  10/10",

            "review_text": "30$ plus 30 more to fix the game with an expansion is way too much for a unfair three years old unpredictable tactic RPG.  Here the long version  This game has ENORMOUS game design flaws that makes this TACTIC RPG unpredicatable, the encounter system forces you into extreme caution and creates boring gameplay. Also, this game's UI and engine are super buggy. Most of the problems can be fixed by a 30$ expansion, but the bugs aren't patched in the regular game.  First of, the difficulty is artificial. This game is not hard if you know what you're doing, but RNG makes it unpredictable. Sometimes you miss 95% shots. It happens and is not inhenrently bad game design. What is bad game design is when you cannot prepare in a tactic RPG. Sometimes enemies just spawn next to you and uses overwatch, which means your first priority is to kill that enemy because he prevents you from repositionning safely. But when that enemy dies, he explodes into a poison cloud on one of your unit that you could not move without getting shot and killed. There are plenty of those unpredictable situations that makes the game smiply unfair instead of difficult.  The way you encounter enemies is also very flawed. Since you are very vulnerable to aliens because there is very little full cover (at least in Enemy Unknown), you advance very, very slowly, which creates boring missions. If you don't move slowly, you encounter several alien groups in one turn and they simply kill you. Sometimes alien run into you during their turns, at which point they are given another turn to reposition because aliens do not have good enough AI to move from cover to cover in the fog of war. This si not a huge problem, but it still creates this impression that the game is cheating you. Sometimes, during the aliens' turn, multiple groups of them walks in your line of sight. This creates situations in which you are at a clear disadvantage only because of the game's RNG.  The UI is extremely buggy and lacking. First of, you cannot know what your soldiers are able to shoot before moving. This forces you to take moves without knowing what follow ups are possible afterwards. The lack of indication on your line of sight (and the aliens' line of sight) makes it that you have to GUESS in a TACTIC RPG, which is exactly what you are trying to prevent in this genre of games. You cannot take the less risky move if the game lacks a UI that indicates what the safest move is. Sometimes, parts of the UI don't load, which leaves you waiting 10 seconds for the max distance of a soldier's move to load. When you shoot a rocket or a smoke grenade, the game shows you a sphere to indicate the range of the explosion. That sphere is lying. The range is actually a bit smaller than what it shows you, which can result in you wasting ressources because of the terrible UI.  This game has a weird way to show the results of its RNG calculations into the engine. Sometimes, you miss, then the game shows you shooting into the alien's shoulder three times and tells you you missed. Sometimes you shoot trough ally soldiers or walls, without breaking the walls, etc.  I think the worst about this game is how most of these UI problems are fixed through the game's expansion, Enemy Within. The 30$ patch provides other gameplay elements, but, most importantly, it fixes issues with the original game. For exemple, rockets indicators now changes to red everthing that will be damaged by the explosion. This is nice, sure, but these changes were not patched into the regular game. This basically makes Enemy Within a paid patch and renders this game alone a TERRIBLE value proposition.",

I didn't like it for personal reasons as it was not like the classic version where you could have multiple bases not just one. Where you could have multiple hyperwave decoders that act like rader not just one. Where you could have multiple psi labs that trained more than 3 people per base, not just one.   Well I went back and now have played this game over 20 hours now and I can say I actually liked it taking the nostalgia goggles off. Even if it's 4-6 man squads instead of over 20 like the classic on missions, it makes things way more personal when you lose a soldier of high rank. After I get paid next I am gonna download the enemy within dlc then wait for xcom 2.   You can thank beaglerush on youtube for previewing xcom 2. That's why I went back and played more of this game. If you haven't tried this game and you have over 50 games in your library or something, this is one game you absolutely cannot pass up.  P.S. Percentages don't mean jack in this newest series.   EDIT: So I finally got the Enemy Within expansion. I haven't gotten too far in but I played the zombie mission where you need to clear the infestation. That was hard as ♥♥♥♥ to finish. I lost one guy and finished on the last turn so much for a perfect game, I couldn't even save scum around it even if I wanted to. I would highly reccomend this and install the DLC as soon as you can so you can play the missions sooner rather than later in your campaign.",

            "review_text": "XCOM Complete Edition Summary :  Pros :  1. Very DECENT strategic decision making like the old XCOM titles, however the game is dumbed down a lot for the modern audience (because almost everyone plays games these days unlike the old days) and a lot of those decisions dont exist anymore. Still makes you feel like the Commander of XCOM.  2. Repetitive dialogues NEVER get old in this game, which is suprising by itself.  3. Each Mission, each save/load game, each of EVERYTHING is randomly generated and doesnt have anything to do with the previous positioning or timeline of a Mission except the progress. FRESH every time you load the game in the same mission.  4. Many customizations and loadout options although the older XCOM games had way way more stuff but like I said this is a a more simple version.  5. I recommend easy difficulty for people that arent veterans in turn based strategy games as you will die a lot. Even though the soldiers have no storylines to themselves except one guy, you will feel devastated everytime someone dies in your team.  6. Battle strategy is crucial to winning every mission with excellent rankings.  7. The council report of A makes you feel so good of yourself that you might just go to sleep.  8. With dated graphics and sometimes broken AI this game is still the most addicting turn based RTS you can find on the steam database.  Cons :   1. The game has a crash issue which gets fixed once you enable the hardware Physx via the config file, google for instructions.  2. The game fights with older hardware Physx on weaker gpus like 9800GTX+ / GTX 260 / GTX 285 and berseker units make the game lagg during their movements.  3. Save game issue, you really need to disable steam cloud sync for the save files of XCOM and also periodically delete older save files as the file limit is limited and once you run out, you cant save anymore but it doesnt so any dialogue box after that so you wont know if its saved or not till you learn the hard way.  9/10 - A Game Reboot that met the expectations.",

My support trooper, he was the backbone of my X-Com team. He ran more missions than anyone else on the team and saved the lives of just about everyone at least once, popping smoke and deploying medkits. He was more than a medic- he had 54 confirmed kills and was a crack shot with a plasma rifle.   On his 28th mission the team hit heavy resistance securing a downed UFO. After tense fighting against elite troops that left half the team wounded, a mech that we'd never seen appeared. This big ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ put two plasma rounds into our MEC trooper, critically wounding him. Whiskey sprinted to his side and stabilized him, saving his life. Afterward he tried to sprint to Carol 'Spider' Stevens, our wounded sniper, to pop a medkit on her. Passing a doorway the mech unexpectedly got an open shot on him, and put two rounds clean through his midsection. He died instantly.   I play on Ironman, which means no quickloading, and losing him hit me like I've rarely ever been hit by a game. I even thought about him the next day at work. In X-Com, every decision counts and death is permanent. Your squad members that survive and develop over many missions become something special, and when you lose one it can be absolutely devastating.   That sort of emotional investment is why I play games, and I can't recommend this one enough!   10/10",

            "review_text": "It was raining. Corporal Mayweather adjusted the sights on her laser sniper. It was pretty fancy but she almost preferred the standard issue rifle, not this alien junk. She hated them. It was still hard to believe this was even happening: aliens, abductions, death. It was all she knew now. For the last 6 months she jumped from mission to mission. Quickly falling into the role of squad sharpshooter. Her lightning reflexes and dead aim kept the others alive, and she could never take her job seriously enough. This particular day they had been flown to Germany to invetigate a downed UFO, a milk run, command had said. She was beginning to doubt it. The squad leader had her positioned on a ridge, providing overwatch to her comrades below, and watch she did. Suddenly out of the corner of her eye she saw them. Three sectoids. Thats what the scientists called them. They had that 'classic' alien look to them and they carried plasma rifles attached to their wrists. She alerted the rest of her squad and they took up position. Stevens ran up to the ridge and took cover behind a stump. 'You all set up there?' he asked. Mayweather looked down and gave a nod, her bright purple hair soaked and matted on her head. Stevens was the squad medic and she had taken a particular liking to him. He was always quick to run in the line of fire and rescue a downed squadmate or provide moral support. The sectoids approached cautiously, and as they closed in a few shots rang out from the east. It was the rookie, Himata. He had panicked and taken a few shots at the sectoids, but was nowhere near his target. Mayweather shot a glare in his general direction, but she remembered how it was during her first mission. The poor guy could barely keep himself alert and mentally intact. Wait... Had she heard those noises before? The downed UFO echoed something fierce and suddenly three Floaters shot out of the hangar bay. She had a few confirmed floater kills from previous missions and she knew they were a force to be reckoned with. Her training and reflexes kicked in and she snapped a quick shot at the nearest floater. As it always did, the shot connected with a crisp burning sound and the floater dropped, lifeless, to the ground. The other two quickly hovered into positions and began their counter attack. Their heavy plasma rifles flashed in a series of shots that seemed to casually drift not to her, no. Stevens was their target. Desperate not to lose him she shouted: 'STEVENS GET DOWN!' He was hit, badly. She jumped down from the ridge and ran to his side, struggling to give him any kind of cover. 'Mayweather, what are you doing!' It was the seargent, he sympathized with her but he knew she was their only chance at getting out of this mission alive. 'Get back on overwatch!' She was torn, conflicting emotions tumbling around inside her. She looked down at Stevens and as their gaze connected two things happened. First: she realized what stevens would have her do, he wanted her to do her job, to kill those ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s that had caused the human race so much pain. The second thing that happened was that a plasma shot from a previously unseen sectoid came flying through the air straight at Stevens. Time seemed to slow as it lazily drifted into the side of his head and continued onwards, as if the human life it had just taken didn't phase it at all. Even though her sights were muddled from the tears, Mayweather stood and took her shot. The sectoid fell, then another, and another. Her thoughts lost in a cloud of rage, she let loose and gave the aliens what they deserved. Justice wasn't as simple as paying them back, and it was small compensation for what they had taken from her, because she knew none of her missions would be the same again.     There is enough emotional material in this game to write a million books.  10/10 would become amateur author again.",

The graphics are good for the time, enemies are unique and constantly changing, and as a bonus, the game actually requires you to THINK to get the best performance out of any mission. Currency managing is a must, as doing so will reward you when something bad DOES happen.  Breakdown:  Pro(s) +Good graphics. (Customizable for higher-end PC's like mine.) +Smart enemy AI - It WILL kill you if you don't pay attention! +As your forces get better, they can be customized to fill the role that you want them to fill. +Has a very interesting mechanic of researching and constructing facilities to further your 'Rush to the top!' +Story is..Well..Interesting! It won't bore you to death, if you're into that kind of thing. +Overall a well made game. Enemy within Significantly adds to the game, and fixes some annoying bugs, too. +Really nice customization. Especially the customization DLC 'Elite soldier' which gives you some sweet power-ranger lookin' crap.  Cons: -After a while, the aliens begin advancing so damn fast, that it's mentally straining to know that it will only get worse. ( At first, this is 100% OK, keeps you interested and won't allow you to become overpowered. BUT, eventually, it just gets ridiculous..) -Some pretty annoying state-of-the-art bugs. (Honestly? You can easily look right past them, so it's all good. ) -System can often screw you violently. A 90% shot can miss really easily. (Realism. Realism hurts.. ) -Some aliens are outright overpowered no matter what you upgrade. (Ok at early stages - Later becomes annoying, as you know 'Okay I'm definetly going to get one guy seriously injured after this.. )   Middle:  -/+ System can and WILL cheat you, with insane amounts of aliens to fight at once. (This, again, is okay at the early stages. But eventually - - It's too much to handle, no matter how advanced your guys are. ) -/+ The maps repeat. ( This is kind of OK, as you become familiar with maps and learn the best tactical approuch to overcome odds at them. ) -/+ Aliens advance just like you. (Is okay at early stages - But they can and WILL start advancing 3x as fast as you, and suddenly, out of the blue, have MANY, new, powerful units. ) -/+ The 'Will' stat on soldiers. (While this is reasonable, sometimes, it makes you want to bash your head in with a rock. You'd think a soldier's will would seriously increase if you win - But no, this game pretty much says 'This, this is your soldier's will. THIS is how it will stay-, and annoy the hell out of you when one of them panics randomly because their will is slightly lower than the next guy. OR, worst case, gets mind controlled because of it. Really annoying, but I guess understandable. )   Overall: 8/10. Very good, and very fun. Early stages become fun, while keeping the difficulty up there. Later stages..Well, become significantly more annoying to deal with and overcome.    ",

Having wasted my middle school years playing the original X-Com, I wanted to see rebirth of deep strategy on a global scale from a capable game studio, but XCOM went a different direction. The combat is actually fun and modern, but there are 'features' that make the combat scenarios unappealing, such as aliens getting a free move upon discovery and wounds making soldiers more likely to panic-- permanently. I wish Firaxis had given more options in base construction and some random encounter maps to lend the game replay value. As is, playing once was enough.",

However, the game itself is a pure tacticians dream. The game immerses you as the officer in command who must tell his troops where to go and what to do. In the beginning you control up to 4 soldiers on a field of battle that is turn-based. You must first order your soldiers where to move, and if possible what to do after moving. Such as attacking an enemy, or setting up cover fire, throwing a grenade, etc.  You are also in command of the main base where your soldiers are housed and all the technology and weapons come from. As you progress in the game you are given currency to spend on makeing facilities, building armor or weapons, and also building aircrafts to protect the skies with as well. Depending on how well you do in the missions you can also gain access to various research options which will allow you to make better upgrades for your soldiers or aircrafts you make.  This game can become highly addictive, and if you play each mission very cautiously like I did you will end up finding yourself watching the hours go by as you become immersed within the game. There is too much to do and far little time from my experience. Finding the right balance is key, and if you are a perfectionist expect to start the game over a few times until you get the hang of it.  Have yet to play the expansion, but I've heard its even better and offers more of a challenge but also even better upgrade options. Well worth the price.",

Every country you gain funding from improves your chances to get new weapons and units to kick the arses of new, heavily armoured or psychic aliens. A variety of missions are available after a few hours, and this is where the fun begins.  The game focuses on turn-based squad strategy. Placing units behind objects for cover, using weapons and abilities to eliminate hostile forces is crucial, while trying not to get killed along the way. Key tip: you are expected to lose lots of squad members throughout your playthrough, maybe even losing funding from a country, but it's okay - that's how XCOM works.  The artwork is nothing to behold, honestly, but some of the designs for the aliens and mechs are pretty cool. The environments look a bit repeditive (probably because they are) after a while, but they are also destructive.  The key fun factor to this game is the multiplayer. It's very customisable with choosing units and abilities, but with different limit settings you'll need to use a bit of strategy or luck to win.  With the XCOM: Enemy Within expansion, new missions, units, environments, abilities and upgrades are available with make this awesome game even better.",

With added weapons, armor, gene therapy, and a new subplot involving a Cult of Sirius-like human enemy called Exalt this game has earned itself several new replays.

I've never played the original, so unfortunately I can't make comparisons with earlier games - but seeing this as a standalone, I've found this to be a very addictive (and challenging enough, even at normal difficulty) turn-based strategy game. The pace of battle is taking cover and moving in slow, deliberated steps at a time while taking care not to expose your flanks in various environments, using the debris and buildings you have at disposal for your ingenuity. If Game's Workshop were to make a Necromunda game for PC, I would look at this as a starting template. Managing your base (a vague similarity to Evil Genius echos, but without boobytraps) is an extra factor to deal with when you're not on the battlefield. Researching, upgrading, building ships to stave off UFO invasions and making decisions with consequences are many of things you need to budget for with your limited funding at disposal. A (small) particular upside I like is that you can customise the look and names for your squad members - but it does make it harder to accept when you lose them in battle. A (small) downside is with the customisation - there isn't enough faces, races, hair, etc. to play around with. Overall - you could probably play this game, one battle at a time and put it away and come back to it the next day (for all us full-timers out there, stuck at the grindstone), but chances are, you will lose sleep with that 'just one more battle and then I'm done' kind of attitude.",

That said, I was a fan of the original Xcom, and Terror from the deep, so it was going to be hard to like a remake. Xcom Enemy Unknown and Enemy Within are not remakes, they are concept enhancements. It is a very good example of taking the best features and applying them with new technology of the day and some new Ideas. It is still turn based, it is still time unit based. It still has place the base and build the base. It has soldier development, which is so important to hook you. All mine are named after family and friends as soon as they have a specialism. I give them cool outfits and laugh when they get assigned nick names/call signs that are just so appropriate to my family. The tension when the top squad is in sickbay and you send out the new team on a hard mission is great and a sign of how effective buy in is. great telling the family member you just turned in to a zombie and I had to kill you. What could be better? Well I would like to assign call signs myself, be able to pick up dropped equipment and be over burdened as in the original Xcom. Bigger maps, more maps, a map editor and the ability to play from the Alien side so we could have whole campaigns of player versus player. That's it, add those and you have reached turned based heaven rather than pushing at the pearly gates. thank you for not disapointing my hopes and for confounding my fears with respect to the original Xcom. Well done!",

It seamlessly combines tactical RPG and resource management while providing with a decent, interesting story and a setting full of surprises to discover. Everything about this game is solid : the combats are thrilling and engaging, the base building / management part is very well balanced and the whole formula is addicting. You might find yourself waiting for one more mission, one more upgrade to your weaponry, one more science lab discovery.  The best part about the game is how unforgiving it can be. Soldiers die easily in this game, especially early on. You may lose many good men in your first few missions, but those who survive will thrive on the battlefield : they will be your heroes, the pillars of your teams... until they fall, too. One big mistake can lead to a character's doom, no matter how far you are in the game. XCOM manages to make progression feel truly meaningful while never allowing you to ignore the risks of a mission. For extra fun, use the character editor to make your soldiers look like your real-life friends, rename them and try to keep them alive as long as possible.  I recommend the expansion, for it fixes the only true issue I had with the base game : the very limited amount of maps. Enemy Within adds a lot of new battlefields, which makes missions very unpredictable and fresh. It adds amazing new concepts such as mechanical soldiers in giant steel suits and genetically modified super soldiers and also has you fighting human enemies that are often much more crafty and dangerous than the aliens you usually confront. It's a great expansion that improves on nearly everything.  If you're not afraid of a hard game that rewards progress as much as it punishes you for your mistakes, I think XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a game for you.",

The fact i still want to play this game proves how great it is.   The gameplay is fun and building up your squad throughout the game is the best part. You'll find you get really attached to your team members in this game. I had a Norwegian and Irish guys, both assault that were some of my core veteran members. I lost them both in the same mission and genuinely felt distraught atthere loss. The way this game makes you care about your team is a brilliant accomplishment. Besides the turn based combat which makes up the core of this game game you also have tojuggle things like researching new equipment,building up your base and keeping all the council members happy which all combined makes for a really challenging strategic experience.  The only complaint i have is that the non-story missions can geta bit boring as there isn't mch variety in mission types but this didn't impact on my enjoyment of this game too much.

It has everything a good game needs and after finishing it, it is not possible not to start a second game with a higher difficulty. It is a round based taktic game with some RPG elements combined with trade, diplomacy and PERMADEATH. Yes when a soldier dies you will never see him/her again. (mayby in the ingame cimitry but thats all)   The story is quite simple: Aliens are attaking the world ...... I guesss you can imagine the rest. But the special thing is the gameplay anyway. You have to build your base produce and explore new technologies survey the countries round the globe. (it is impossible to survey them all you will loose some) and try to find out what the aliens want. With time you build up your team, improve the special skills of your soldiers and try to keep them alive.  In the DLC, which I recomand, you have eaven some little side quests and you have treators all around the globe. AND YOU CAN BUILD FREAKING MECHS WITH GATTLINGS AND FLAMETHROWERS!!!! and something with modyfy genetic soldiers or smth. like that.  But in my opinion its important to play it with 'iron man' mode on. So you have no possibilities to save your game before you have to take decissions  -&gt; ergo when your favorite/strongest soldier die no way to get it back.   -&gt; Attaked the wrong county- meh deal with it.  -&gt; Yor enemies are firing with lasers and you only with bad pistols because you wanted to explore better armor instead of plasma weapons 10 hours ago -- you will loose.  Yes thats possible too in the iron man mode you loose one important battle and you have lost the entire game. No respawn or safe spots, game over has his defenition back.  It sounds hard but it still makes a lot of fun and you are motivated to restard imiedatly. Thats the other cool side of this game, every 5 minutes you get new epic stuff to kick some asses out from this planet, and suddenly its 3o clock in the morning.   But there is the other side of the medal too. The fighting system is way too easy. Mayby its quite cool for beginners but much too simple after the first playthrough. Eaven Warhammer 40k for the nintendo DS had a much more complicated fighting sytem.( ok I exagerate, but only a bit)  But beginners will still be bombarded with information in the first 15-30 min   ( fighting system, level ups, base building , resource management, radar controlls, planes, money .........and in the DLC you can eaven build your first mec within the two first hours of gameplay)  and than there is only little new things during the rest of the game (wow psychic class and mayby a handfull of new aliens. And there aren't eaven much of them maybe a dozen and most of them arent really special or extraordinary)  There are some other things wich doesnt really work but that would be nidpicking because every game has some smaller problems you can live with.  (balancing problems, seekers will not attak groups of you (wich isnt cool because they are invisible and you have to kill them to win--ak ai fail) , a bug to detect seekers without a special perc(look where your soldiers can go and where not), and this thing with the stairs(i hate them because it isnt possible anymore to navigate accurately when there is more than 1 floor)  ok especialy in the end I sounded harch but the reason is that that is a realy good ROUND BASED game (there are't enough of them) but has some problems wich are disturbing the expirience of this (in my eyes) beautyfull game. BUT to everyone who can imagine to play a game wich shows you consequences of making wrong decisions, exploring new technologies and combat tactics I have to say: BUY IT  and why is it 11oclock again?",

Then just keep playing that, rather than wasting your money on something you 'know' will disappoint you, and your energy on complaining about it.",

            "review_text": "Okay, where to start with this... Being a fan of Jagged Aliance 2, I have seen several elements from that series that was implemented here, with some alternative twists to it (IE no real time inbetween encounters, no overworld map where mercs/troops in squads have to march around on foot, no REAL stealth mechanics, and no Queen Dedrianna ♥♥♥♥♥ slapping her bad-news advisor, Eliot). Some of these changes are good, some of them are bad.  Most of the issues I've seen are graphical and animation based: soldiers sometimes shoot through walls rather than actually trying to twist around them to shoot at enemies. This provides some humorous moments and some wtf moments as it combines with the rag doll physics that have been employed.  The most irritating issue though is that of the movement and aiming grenades features. To put it frankly, there are so many levels of terrain and the grid is so case sensitive that it winds up twitching between one cell and another. This would not be a problem if it didn't lead to my soldier getting no cover, or that sight scanner from the sniper some how going through the ceiling and on to the roof of an alien space craft.  Also, what is highly annoying is the first time you play the game, it forces you to go through a tutorial that gives you a pretty nasty cruch. 3 out of the 4 soldiers that get sent in at the start are pretty much guaranteed to die. Thankfully it does not force you to repeat this tutorial of death after you've done it once. They also force you to start in America the first time, which leads you to wind up only with cost decreases in the aircraft department... not useful at all for the first playthrough.  Then the final issue is occasionally this mission requirements reminder pops up upon return to the main facilities and it won't really go away until you A) save the game, go to the main menu, and load it up again. or B) some how manage to get it to allow you to take another mission and send your troops off; it will remove it when you go to the battle scenario. This also adds for some confusion as occasionally it'll try to select a facility rather than pay attention to your click on the tabs at the top right of the screen. There is also a bit of an issue with the damn people randomly speaking to you while your in the facilities and giving you an unskippable line, but thats a minor issue, as you can still some what navigate and work using those tabs I spoke of.  ... Thats all the negatives through with. Now, what I can say is despite all of these issues, I have gotten some entertainment value and had some fun with this game. Is it perfect? No, nothing is, I plan on trying to see if there are patches or something for these issues that I spoke of. Is it worth buying? I think it is, provided you find a way to get around the control issues (you should find that turning the map really does help in this department, though you might still hit the occasional throwing something through the ceiling if you have to try and raise the view a little bit so you can actually see what your trying to hit and prevent these issues).  I give it a 7.8 out of 10.",

The game also does a great job making you care about your soldiers since permadeath is in play. Losing a Colonel you've groomed since the beginning is a very tragic moment.   I will say it is easy to learn the base concept but takes a long while to fully grasp the deeper elements of the game and master. I am in no way a master of the game but feel more confident with each playthrough.   After 60+ hours of play I really do not get tired of it. I have not played any of the DLC yet but I am very excited to try it.  All in all one of my favorite go to games.

I was both optimistic and hesitant when I heard about a franchise reboot for XCOM-- excited, of course, but would it live up to the gold standard already carved out by its predecessors?  Make no mistake, the core gameplay *concepts* are all present and accounted for, but the mechanics have changed. XCOM now concerns itself with one central HQ, removing the need to micromanage several different bases. Radar coverage is replaced with remote satellites, and each continent is nice enough to allow you some hangar slots to police the airspace. Within the battlescape, your squaddies now perform two 'actions' per turn, as opposed to the traditional TU system. Move, fire, sprint and a handful of unique abilities replace the classic system I grew up with, and it's... different. Admittedly, I had a little culture shock when I first jumped in, but I feel like it's a case where change really can be a positive thing. My hesitation about the new system faded even within my first session-- it's a genuinely intuitive set of mechanics that very quickly grew on me.  All things considered, my optimism paid off. If you're like me and harbor a classical love of the genre, don't miss out. It's a different game, but I can't put it any more simply than this: The game is a legitimate credit to the franchise, and with the flair of a more modern look and feel, it truly lives up to the XCOM name.",

Now, about the game itself, Enemy Unknown was a good game, but it became a bit repetitive, and the options to grow your soldiers and base were sometimes limited. I didn't even finish it prior to the expansion, also because of the crashes.  With Enemy Within, there are several very welcome additions such as the augmented soldiers (MECs and genetically enhanced), using a new resource (Meld), a few new enemies, new missions, and the EXALT sub-plot. This gives much more variety in the gameplay, story, and overall everything is well balanced. Maybe the MECs should be rebalanced as they are very (too much ?) powerful.

Good storyline there is alot of things to do in this game. Very nice research feature where you unlock new technologies for your alienkilling needs. The gameplay is very intense and every action you do on your turn can possibly lead to one of your field troopers death 'Ironman mode' which makes you play on just one save game thats autosaving so with just that turned on this game can prove to be very difficult. Has couple of tickbox options for further difficulty (Second Wave) And we all like a challenge right? ;)  Some cons and bugs I've noticed -You know if you are going to hit the monster or not and whether youll kill it or not because the camera turns to a different angle if you are going to hit (takes the camera almost behind the weapon sights as you fire) -And as you are going to miss your troopers just aim at almost anything but your real target for like 3s and then shoot. -Sometimes when you save your game just before you are shooting someone with say 99% accuracy and you decide to load after that (maybe wouldnt crit and your toon died and just want to try to play it differently or whatevs.) Even with the 99% hit chance you wont hit anymore. you can reload like 10 times and everytime for that turn you shall not hit. Don't know if that happens with 100% hit but..  Once tried 26 times with 86% hit and always a miss.. so some serious RNG? -nah don't think so. -Unable to skip some cutscenes. Like when you fly to and from mission zones. You are just forced to look at these lift off and landing cutscenes which repeats itself.. well same video every time and have to watch it twice per mission and then theres the scene that shows you your flight path.. Can't skip that either. 9/10",

Getting a favorable engagement is key because a simple misposition can end in a sqaud member death, and unlike other video games they actually die not just 'not unconcious' from a stream of bullets. You actually grow attached to your most powerful squad members and every victory is incredibly rewarding. I recomend saving a bunch when you first start playing until you get the feel of the game just so you don't mess up to badly. Now a lot of the complaints go with 'The orginal X-com is much better/harder'. Most older strategy games had a ton of micromanaging that for some people just becomes tedious while others consider it depth. This reboot focuses on strategy in the battlefield rather than paying for every bullet you fire.

Well-thought out and pretty polished. I've yet to run into a game-related bug, and in an era of buggy releases, that alone gets it a high recommendation from me.

The strategy elements are well balanced and the plot is reasonable at least, with some great individual moments. You have to balance both micro-managing a combat squad in ground missions and strategically planning your research projects and finances.  In the end, the fun happens in the combat missions, where you will fight off aliens attacking civilians, strke their bases, swipe UFO's you shot down and even defend your own ground should they find you.  The long term planing, while not quite as dynamic as the combat missions, is equally important to guarantee your continued survivability. Chose whether to rush your research by adding laboratory may and you may risk not having enough satelite coverage to prevent the aliens from dominating whole nations. Chose the other way around and you risk being greatly overpowered in the long run. This is just one a great deal of strategical choices you will have to make.  The plot, while not a shining masterpiece in itself, is true to its origins and provides great immersion. You are trusted with the decisions on how humanity will fight off the threat of impending exctinction caused by an alien invasion. If you are a fan of the original game, expect to see pretty much everything in this re-enacting. If you are not, then you have a lot of content to explore.  Here's how I'd summarize the ups and downs of this game:  Pro's:  1. Can be challenging at the right difficulty setting. 2. Respects the original game's formula for a balanced TBS experience. 3. Has good replayability value.  Con's:  1. Fails to replicate the tense atmosphere of the original game. 2. Can get a little repetitive without the expansion.  Overal 90/100 without the expansion, 95/100 with it.  *The reason I add 5 points for the expansion is because it adds good variations of combat missions, lots of customization options and new content never before seen in the franchise, adds a lot of new variables to the combat missions, and it all works to improve the overall strategy experience and mitigate some repetitive scenarios of the original game.",

As you kill the aliens, you take their technology and repurpose it to use against them. XCOM is a remake of a very popular old DOS game, and this is the first XCOM game since then to stay in the same genre.  XCOM is very good, but it's far from perfect. The strategic base management is fun, but I would've liked a bit more. The battles were tough and engaging, but they are long and too frequent. Poor controls and camera really hurt the battle system. The story is also far too short for a game of this length. But, this game is still tons of fun, and the situations that emerge through normal gameplay can make for some great stories on their own.  As flawed as the game is, though, it's still a top-notch strategy title. Not many companies are still making games like this, and I'm grateful that Firaxis still puts out amazing strategy titles. Fans of strategy games will love XCOM.  Update: XCOM: Enemy Within has been out for a bit now, and it's definitely worth mentioning. Enemy Within is a full expansion pack that adds the ability to build mech pilots and use gene modifications to give you some more abilities to use. Enemy Within doesn't fix what was wrong with the original, but it improves upon XCOM's strengths. At the very least, I'm much more confident giving this game a recommendation to anyone that's interested in a fun but slow strategy game.",

It is incredibly fun and rewarding to build up a base as you see fit and equip soldiers with all kinds of weapons and armor as you give them orders in battle against alien invaders. The ability to customize your soldiers' names and appearances was a nice touch that can help make the game seem more personal or can be used to make it more silly. You are given a reasonable amount of freedom to deal with the alien threat however you choose. Do you choose to focus on researching armor for your soldiers first? Or do you want to focus on your interceptors? Maybe you want to spend your money on another satellite and forego building that Laser Rifle for the time being. The choice is yours. The recent expansion, XCOM: Enemy Within, added a number of new and extremely fun features including base invasions, mechanized soldiers, and genetically modified soldiers. These add a new level of depth that make the game even more fun. The replayability of the single player of this game is endless due to the various difficulties, Ironman Mode, and a number of modifiers Firaxis has included to alter the game slightly. That being said, the game isn't without flaws. There are a number of minor bugs specifically UI related. At times it is difficult to tell where your cursor is, especially on stages where there a number of different levels to the stage (like the roof of a building), which can lead to some frustrating situations when your soldiers end up going someplace you didn't want them to (especially in Ironman mode!). The RNG can be frustrating and feel unfair at times, but, hey, that's the nature of RNG, isn't it? Overall, the game is absolutely terrific and is a must-buy for anyone into sci-fi and/or turn-based strategy games! 9/10.",

There are always multiple via paths presented, and the game favors a patient and thoughtful approach. I love that.  The game's most glaring issue is the steep learning curve, which isn't the result of the game's difficulty so much as the fact that early on it does a poor job of explaining basic mechanics. It can take a little while to get your feet on the ground and if you're not picking things up fast enough on your own your first playthrough might be a wash.

I missed the ability to scout for enemy bases. In the old X-Com you could visually track where UFOs were and if you followed them on the Geoscope you could sometimes uncover their base. The same went the other way as well. If you shot down a lot of UFOs right outside your base, sometimes they would send a ship to directly assault your base. It wasn't a 'story' element, it was just something that you had to watch out for that could happen at anytime, regardless of whether your base or troops were prepared for it.",

The game is infinitely replayable thanks to alternative upgrades, dozens of maps, mutators to the campaign, and variable difficulty modes that are mitigated somewhat by the ability to quick load a save every time an operative bites it.  Your choices on soldier abilities have impact because choosing one route usually locks out the other. You have limited funding and have to juggle weapons and armor production and research and base expansion.

Being able to just have a country host a satellite and interceptors without the unnecessary base is nice. One complaint I have is not being able to choose a soldiers class. I think a better system would be if you could choose any class you wanted to a soldier but one would be the role they were adept at and you would receive bonuses for taking it over the others. If you're worried about it ruining balance early game, make it something you have to buy from Officer Training and only if you have one of each class maxed out.

No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized, as someone with a microscope studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered the possibility of life on other planets and yet, across the gulf of space, minds immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely, they drew their plans against us.  At midnight on the twelfth of August, a huge mass of luminous gas erupted from Mars and sped towards Earth. Across two hundred million miles of void, invisibly hurtling towards us, came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth. As I watched, there was another jet of gas. It was another missile, starting on its way.  And that's how it was for the next ten nights. A flare, spurting out from Mars - bright green, drawing a green mist behind it - a beautiful, but somehow disturbing sight. Ogilvy, the astronomer, assured me we were in no danger. He was convinced there could be no living thing on that remote, forbidding planet.  'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one,' he said. 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one - but still they come!'  Then came the night the first missile approached Earth. It was thought to be an ordinary falling star, but next day there was a huge crater in the middle of the Common, and Ogilvy came to examine what lay there: a cylinder, thirty yards across, glowing hot... and with faint sounds of movement coming from within.  Suddenly the top began moving, rotating, unscrewing, and Ogilvy feared there was a man inside, trying to escape. he rushed to the cylinder, but the intense heat stopped him before he could burn himself on the metal.  'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one,' he said. 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one - but they still come!' 'Yes, the chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one,' he said. 'The chances of anything coming from Mars are a million to one - but they still come!'  It seems totally incredible to me now that everyone spent that evening as though it were just like any other. From the railway station came the sound of shunting trains, ringing and rumbling, softened almost into melody by the distance. It all seemed so safe and tranquil.   8/10 play on ironman mode unless you're a massive faglord",

I very much enjoyed turn-based squad combat games of the past and was excited to purchase this game. In most aspects this game met my expectations, although there are a few 'glitches' that can be frustrating.  The game has several frustrating bugs that can ruin your playing experience. I remember several times where I was attempting to move my units to a different level, only to have the camera spaz out and accidentally move my guys where I didn't want them to be. Also, sometimes you seemingly can't move to a valid location because the game will not register that you've moved up a level.   Not being able to direct your character's movements in a specific way really hurts this game. In the past XCom game, you could advance little-by-little instead of having to move in one big chunk. While I do agree that removing that from this game was the right decision, not being able to control how your guys get to their destination can prove deadly. Why would I want my guy to run blindly around cover or climb a building and then jump down again when he could have taken a much safe route to get to the same location? This has caused some frustrating deaths or inability to move my guys.  Also, the equipment management is not the easiest thing in the world to use. I've often found myself hunting down individual pieces of equipment from recovering soliders in order to outfit the squad I'm taking on my mission. It would be a lot easier if there was a global list of equipment we could assign rather than having to individually unequip items from soldiers not on the mission.  Although there are fan-made patches to solve some of these issues, the panic system is by far the most frustrating intended part of the game. I can recall several times where a squad member has, for some reason, paniced after someone took a grazing blow, shot his own squad member in the back of the head, which then proceeded to set off a chain reaction of panics and led to the entire squad suiciding after someone took a plasma blast to the arm. That's just frustrating game mechanics and doesn't really have a place here. I realize they were going for the squad panicing in a tough situation, and I know it's tied to will, but especially early on in the game, there's not a whole lot you can do about it. You certainly shouldn't have a good chance of your squad killing themselves at the slightest bit of panic. Hunkering down I can CERTAINLY understand, but all these random actions that they can perform is just ridiculous. It's a bad part of the old game and should have been done away with.  The overall graphical style of this game is excellent, the cut scenes are well played out, and I was actually surprised to note the impressive amount of depth they gave to uncovering what the aliens were actually doing on earth. As I played through it, I wanted to uncover more secrets to find out what exactly was happening with this invasion.  Recommended for anyone who like sci-fi, squad combat, turn-based, or casual gaming experiences.  Not recommended for those who like fast-paced games, don't like sci-fi, and are looking for detailed combat games.",

The enemies were brutal, well armed, and deadly accurate. I was comparatively weak, the constant underdog. But the climb, the work put into each facet of my facilities, and the well knit team I had crafted, all paid off. This game is exceedingly well made, the balances that the player strikes, paired with the work involved are what makes it exceptional. The tactics genre, the most frustrating of gameplay styles, does not overstay its welcome, instead it is well paced and fair in its gameplay. And even minor details are great. I still remember with some glee the faces of the captured aliens, worthy payoffs to the hectic process involved in their capture.

There are two modes to the game: Tactical turn based missions, and base planning in between missions.   The missions are fun and are an absolute blast. When you first start playing, you will probably die a lot, especially at one of the higher difficulty levels. You learn that you need to be careful, advance slowly (but not too slowly) and take chances that matter. Do you want to advance a little faster, maybe get a little bit better ground, knowing all too well that you might get ambushed and wiped out? Or do you want to advance at a snail's pace but then have all of your shots with low percentage hits because of the distance? One thing I will say - cover is your friend. And flanking attacks? Wonderful!  The base planning is a careful balancing act of where to spend money and what missions to take. You build your base, research tech, and decide which countries to save. You cannot save them all, and you will never have enough money, so you need to be very careful. Yeah, that new sniper rifle may be wonderful, but you could use those funds instead to build two new ships capable of intercepting UFO's. It is deep, and a very enjoyable aspect of the game. Personally, I like the base planning even more than the turn based combat, and that is saying A LOT.  After you beat the game, you get the option to turn on new features as well! Things like 'solider have random stats', or 'leveling up provides random bonuses', etc. Basically, you can add a lot more randomness to the game, which I think is a nice touch and gives it a lot of replayability. This is one of the very few games I have gone back to multiple times.  And finally - the expansion: Enemy Within. Holy heck... If you like the base game, you NEED the expansion. It makes the game so much better! They added more than enough features to justify the cost. You can make 'Mechs, you can genetically modify your troopers, they added more enemies with new surprises for you, and a completely additional mini-campaign with some new missions involved. I love the new mission types, especially the one you have to do as part of the regular campaign. I won't say more because I don't want to spoil it, but hands down, the expansion makes this amazing game even better.  I would rate it a 9/10 if you are a fan of turn based strategy and tough choices.  With the expansion, 10/10.",

Obviously there are many differences between the old original (which I got from a friend RAR-ed onto three diskettes all those long years ago) and this remake, but even so, it evokes the same tension, the same narrative, and the same fun the original did. I even find myself being annoyed by the same things, which makes it quite a good remake.  The turn based combat is fluent and well exectued, the enemy AI leaves a bit to be desired, but still manages to suprise me from time to time, the base expansion and maintenance, along with R&amp;D all hold true to the original, and feel natural.  Most importantly however, just like in the original, you begin to care for your squad members, and fear for their safety once a mission goes sour. Losing one is always hard, even the rookies.  So, if your are unfamiliar with the original, but are looking for a tactical turn-based strategy game, give this a try. If you are familiar and indeed even a fan of the original game, definately give this a try. Prepare to meet old frenemies, and get to know a whole bunch of new ones.",

X-Com's 4 classes and small handful of weapon and armor upgrades give you all the options you need to get the job done if you are smart enough to leverage them correctly, and the multitude of alien types will make your head spin.  **EDIT**  Now, that I have had the pleasure of playing the Enemy Within expansion, I must say this is the best strategy game in years.

It ranges from keeping your soldiers from being wounded/getting kill in missions, to stopping aliens from abduction/terrorizing countries to keep the council funding the XCOM.   During missions you'll have to be careful on how you'll position your soldiers. Because depending on what difficulty you're playing, (I recommend Normal for people getting started) the A.I will try to flank you in any chance it has, or you'll sturr up a hornets nest and will end up having to fight off a large number of enemys. So it not recommended to go running off in the fog of war unless you want five or more aliens shooting at your squad.  You can also customize your base. From building laboratorys to power plants to exotics ones. You can build your underground base anyway you like.    If you think you got the hang of the game and you'll start breezing through missions without losing a guy... It won't last long... This game will only get harder and worse the more you proceed. Enemy's will get stronger and worse to the point where you'll be biting your nails again.   Of course you can get better weapons and armour for your soldiers, including equipping your intercepters (Your jets) with better weapons to take down alien aircraft. Even have satellites coverage on countries to monitor alien activity. But this will take time to build/research and you will likely be put into situations where you'll have to decide which countries would you like save from withdrawing? Armour or Weapons first? and as well as other tough decisions.   If you're a fan of the original 'XCOM UFO DEFENCE' or Someone thats not into turn-base games? You will love this. Dosen't matter what sort of fan or what genre or any other reason.... This is a game that you must play...   ",

            "review_text": "Everything about me wants to mark this as a 'YES'.  However, because of the problems with this game, I MUST give it a no. This game should be considered BETA at best. Unfortunately, most 'BETA' games on steam should be PRE-ALPHA so, my scale isn't quite the same as STEAM's.  Here's the major problems: - Game locks up into impossible situations - example: Character required to move, with no 'valid' locations to move. - Save system is WRETCHED!!! I can't under-emphasize this point, if the game did not have any lock-ups (which it does) you would want to plan for a gaming marathon, and never a short session, because the opportunities to save are few &amp; far between. When you're at your base &amp; hit [ESC] there's no menu to save, and when I've been on missions, there are two options 'Proceed, or Return' and 'return' does nothing. Why even make a button that does not work?  My personal grievance: So far there's one track to follow, and it is a buggy track. I got to a place that mandated 'Launching a missile' to continue, but there were no options to 'Launch a missile'. And since I could not save, I had to relaunch from a previous campeign, as there were no auto-saves either. I was completely stuck @ 'Launch missile to continue' and could not goto mission control, or the situation room, and those were two of the three buttons possible to push, the third was about events &amp; that just told me nothing was upcoming. With nothing 'upcoming' and no way to leave a screen, because both buttons were broken, it became an eternity of hell, that I couldn't reload back to, as again, no save was available.  My personal praise: There are many redeeming aspects of this game. The concept is brilliant, and the action-sequences are amazing. I like the level of graphics, and a lot of work was done here. I'm looking forward to more from this developer &amp; this makes me delighted at the prospect of multiplayer with this game-style.  Hopefully there will be an update that addresses these issues, until then, I need to keep my 'No' for recommendation.",

Game actually hard, countries ♥♥♥♥♥out too quickly if you mess things up, the chance to hit system is a pain in the butt( you could be standing next to each other, and unless the chance is 100% , you could miss) , also your soldiers sometimes panic because they see their team member die, you need to keep balance between upgrading your soldiers equipment, proving satelite coverage while pleasing the council.  So to sum up this game provides a decent challange, a good ammount of hours, fun and sometimes unforgiving gameplay. Also has a cherry on top which is multiplayer, where you can actually take a role of the Aliens (which my opionion has more interesting and fun classes).",

I hated the tendency a couple of years ago that everything suddenly had to be a first person shooter, so I'm glad that finally a sequel of a great classic was made without replacing all the game mechanics by mindless shooting.  Compared to the original X-COM some parts of the game mechanics were simplified (e.g. it's not possible to change stance or view direction), but the rest was adapted to modern graphics and gameplay so well, that it didn't bother me too much (yet I would have liked it better to keep the old game mechanics ;-) ) Definitely a highly addictive game (just one more mission, just one more research, or with DLC just one more gene modification ;-) ), unfortunately it feels short, but only because you have to play evening after evening and suddenly it's over. In my opinion it's a perfect example how to port a great classic with awesome gameplay to modern times, without loosing all the original greatness.  UPDATE: After initial performance problems on Linux, I can say now, that the game runs great since the last updates. Had some trouble with my XBox 360 controller, the support from Feral (who made the Linux support) was very friendly and helpful, turned out the controller was broken, so in fact everything works really great on Linux now :-)",

Overall, this is a good game with replayability value. Especially if you check out the long war mod.  What it doesn't do good, is the aiming system which partially relies on a, shall we say, way too random randomnumber generator. I've seen 1% hit and I've seen 100% miss, but most of the time if the aim is lower than 70%, you're more likely to miss than not. Sometimes it doesn't even help that you're standing adjacent to the enemy. Now this isn't awfully frequent, and certainly not frequent enough to ruin the game. But it is annoying when it does happen. And it doesn't really help that the enemy seemingly always have a bigger chance to hit than you. Furthermore, there are some problems with clipping and line of sight. There have been instances where you or the enemy is able to shoot through the wall. At other times, you feel like you ought to be able to see an enemy but cannot. Again, nothing frequent and nothing game breaking, just know that it can happen. The enemy also gets a free move action, when you discover them, which they'll use to run into cover if available, or sometimes even to flank you, giving them a big bonus to aim and critical damage chance.  The base game works really well even on lower end computers. I used to play it on a laptop with just one core. Now I say USED to, because once I upgraded to Xcom Enemy Within, the requirements changed to a minimum of two processor cores. Something I wasn't very happy about, especially since there was no warnings given. The DLCs available are overpriced and really should have been included with the basegame, it hardly offers naught. Yet the ability to change colors of uniforms and customize the soldiers costs extra. And yes, I do own all the DLCs, though I would strongly suggest getting them at a sale.  There could definately have been a few more maps, aliens and especially different types of missions. The missions consists of;  -Kill all enemies -Escort squishy and useless VIP -Disarm Bombs -Kill all enemies while rescuing idiotic civilians  And not much else, none of the DLCs or the Expansion offers much more variety either. But despite all the ways that the developers are cheap, greedy, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s and the small ways in which the game is broken, it IS STILL FUN. No really, it is.",

The dynamics, the cinematics, everything about the game is great. The gameplay was very detailed and good for a turn-based strategy game. The story was okay, but what made it the most fun were the soldiers you commanded during the entire alien invasion. All the soldiers you receive are randomly generated, yes. But you can customize them to how you want, and I did just that. I didn't lose a single soldier the entire game, and I kind of bonded with 8 soldiers of mine that I would switch in and out depending on if any suffered injuries. Regardless, I ranked them up to the highest rank a soldier could receive and I really cared about their survival. Once you spend all that time ensuring they do the most amount of damage, surviving any damage, and tailoring them to how you want them to look, you bond with your soldiers.

But you can have only one base, it's due to simplification of the gameplay, to make this game more user friendly - booooring.  - 1 points.    Battle screen. This game is way more casual than original one, but due to awesome new perk system, the variety of moves you can make is far more wider than you can imagine. Your soldiers can retrieve Psy-abilities, or can become a cyborg - ultimate fighting machines(imbalanced i think). But there are not many kinds of missions in this game, in fact most of missions are boring as hell, it's either abduction missions, or bomb mission, both of them based on speed of you advancing through the map. Faster you move - better you go, but in the meantime, it costs you safety. You have to balance speed and safety to be successful.  - 3 points for battle screen(6 points for battles and -3 pts for boredoom).    Screenplay.   DANGER!!! ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! Boredoom again. You will have some 'story' missions, but they're not very various. You will have to go through so called 'sidestory' about another secret agency involved in conflict, but it's boring. Everything about this story is boring.  - 1 point, it's like, come on, it's a strategic game, what do you want?    Graphics. Design.   Cute, nothing more. Design is cartoon like. Aliens are boring. XCOM equipment is okay, not interesting but okay. Other stuff is boring aswell.  - 1 point.   Specs.   Optimization is poor. Game runs okay with something like GHz 2.4 dual core CPU, 6Gb RAM, 500 MHz GPU, 1024 VRAM. But if you have less - you will suffer. Yeah, I know, those specs are pretty low, but, baby Jesus, in this game you don't have anything that can load your PC.  - 2 points.   Multiplayer.   And in the end, the thing you will definitely enjoy - multiplayer. It's awesome, because of the varieties of moves that game gives you, it's really interesting.  - 6 points.   So, let's see. (0 + 1 + 3) + 1 + 1 + 2 + 6 = 14 / 5 =  ~3 points.  You should play this game, because of the multiplayer. Singleplayer is rather boring or difficult.       3 POINTS",

That compared with the inability to just load whenever something goes wrong is amazing. It feels like reading 'A song of ice and fire', you know you love it, but damn, your precious soldiers... Only thing I would improve is the 'out of mission' difficutly, failing a mission ends the whole game rather swiftly.

Anyway, I enjoyed the play until mid-game, after that it started to feel boring. Once you research the plasma weapons &amp; badass armors and build the advanced fighters it became a bit too repetitive without a real challenge.

This game has very few shortfalls and was very entertaining - lots of replayability, though i would recommend buying its expansion pack at the same time; 'Enemy Within' as this allows far more customization of your individual soldiers as well as awards/medals and obviously, extra mission variation and content.  Pros: - well thought out and simple interface, everything has a purpose here and its explained well enough even for turn-base tactical rookies like myself, stats system is totally self explanitory. - looks good, weapons and explosions - buildings and destroyable cover. - engaging gameplay with a good prospect for replayability. - varied soldier types, nearly every perk is useful in some way and they can all support different playstyles, except snipers and squadsight ... that is the ONLY perk ive found you HAVE to pick. - every action has a consequence, you cant just bull rush the objective and not take casulties and casulties can cost you time or your best trained soldiers life, its also a game where you cannot save everyone - you must carefully manage how you respond to alien abductions and terror attacks to mimimize worldwide panic and keep x-com nations in the game. - encourages careful play with your assets, money, alloys, weapon parts and most importantly, troops - losing an experienced soldier can be disasterous, pro tip; always end your turn in cover! - like almost all turn based games, there is no limit on your turn - you can spend as long as you like considering your next move. - no autosave by default - its an option, but i believe the devs intended it to be a game that once youve made a choice its final but with the way gamers are these days, if there wasnt an autosave feature it would be considered herasy of the highest order. - soldiers behave like real troops under heavy pressure and may panic and make snap descisions.  Cons:  - Movement system is a little junky when working with altitudes, mech walkers jetboot module cannot see higher altitudes when there are movable tiles directly under them. - Grappling hooks on armor are buggy and may launch your troops across the map instead of say; climbing to the top of that building. - soldier voice packages are a little limited, even though Enemy Within added much more - many nationalities still lacked a flare in their speech and many languages were not included. - final boss fight easier than the battleship raid, infact, i believe the hardest mission i played was the one where you have to call down an airstrike and get out when youre surrounded by chrysalids. - too many troops, not enough bad guys!  All in all, if you like this genre of strategy game ... then this is definately a good game for you, if you can stand the sometimes infuraitaing RNG like missing on a 99% hit chance.",

Found a 3rd-party software that makes windowed games seem fullscreen and it was perfect! Different ways work on different machines, it seems.  However, for reasons unknown to me, the game can corrupt your saves upon trying to load them. And now that my 3rd game's save-files got corrupted I've lost my will to even try to start a new game. 'Corrupted' acts like your screen freezes on game load, but the game responds to keyboard/mouse input (audio works).

I have cackled gleefully and mouthed 'Boom! Headshot!' as an elite sniper takes down an alien halfway across the map in glorious cinematic action. Gritted my teeth in exasperation and watched helplessly as nations critical to the funding of my XCOM forces were absorbed by the ever encroaching Alien forces. Cried out in dismay as veteran soldiers got cut down in battle and then desperately filled out my depleted forces with inexperienced rookies, praying they make it through the next mission.  This is a game that sucks hours out of your life until finally you either emerge bloody and victorious, or it crushes you in ignomious defeat. Overall game replayability is limited but there is some variation in the way you approach each mission tactically and the strategic campaign overall. Plus you can make big stompy cyborg troops and gentically enhanced super soldiers! This game is like a neverending supply of your favourite food of choice and you will find yourself gorging on it constantly, until you are sick of it, and take a long break from eating it again before returning to gorge on it once more.

The game is spent deligating research, construction, purchasing, and (to a much lesser degree) financial tasks. This is great fun as it adds a sort of overarching strategy to the game. However, the primary focus of the gameplay is on each individual mission. These playout as turn-based, squad-based, combat scenarios. They make for great fun. There are tactics such as flanking and cover bonuses. Shots are on a percentage chance to hit basis, which means you can sometimes have a glorious unlikely success, as well as a stunning unlikely defeat. While this adds a negative element of luck to a game of strategy, I feel the lack of certainty is realistic and adds a great element of intensity. You can customize and name your squad, which is great because, frankly, you grow attached to your soldiers. When one dies, they are gone for good, which helps add to the intensity mentioned above.  Pros: - Fun strategy and turn-based combat. Similar to a tabletop war game of some sort. - Single Player has an element of long-term strategy gaming which I enjoy. - You form surprising attachments to your squad members. - You will find yourself becomming emotionally involved. - The levels and events are mostly random - You often have to make hard decisions which can sometimes have very negative consequences. This isn't game ending.  Cons: - The game crashed on me twice.... That's really the only thing I can think of a the moment.  If you like turn-based combat, and/or tabletop war games, buy this game.

Best of all, it is very decently priced (at 30€ for the full bundle EU/EW/DLCs) and if you're lucky, you can even snatch it at some 80% discounts as well during sale events. If it's not in your library yet, make sure it's at least #1 on your Wishlist.",

Everytime one of my units die, I find myself asking, 'Why XCOM, why do you do this to me?' and smiling at the same time. To sum this game up, it doesn't hand victory to you lightly, and it was designed as such. It is creative and has a lot to offer to the strategy genre of video games. In XCOM, you are the commander of an elite last defense called the XCOM project that is to be activated if/when aliens attack earth, and of course, aliens attack. You must fight back the alien threat with a squad of the finest soldiers from any and every country. The ultimate goal of the game is to defeat the alien threat and not get your funding pulled.  One of the things that makes the game so great is that it limits you to a certain extent. Certain classes can only weild certain weapons which are only good for certain things (I.E. A sniper will be horrible at point blank range with a sniper rifle). This helps make it so that a player doesn't become so overpowered that the game just isn't a challenge anymore.   Now, with any good game, there are some annoying cons. Sometimes, units can't see down ramps which makes it extremely hard to get rid of anything on said ramp and will likely kill your unit because of it. There are also some small visual bugs such as bullets coming out of a units side when he shoots at something, but it's more funny than annoying since it doesn't happen too often. Also, if you are to buy this game, you should note that it isn't very story driven.  For this game, I would not only recommend buying it but also the Enemy Within DLC which adds more missions, maps, and an entirely new enemy to the game (as if one wasn't enough).   So really, if you don't have this game already, you should get it. It has brought me lots of fun and well earned this review and it's way to the top of my favorites list.    (For those who hate reading things that long review)   Pros:     Good gameplay    Amazing DLC    Hard but fun at the same time    Creative   Cons     Small visual bugs    Line of sight bugs    No big storyline  ",

Very high factor for replayability, because each time you play again it is a little bit different. 6. The turn-based combat is the best I have seen so far in any game, it keeps up the suspense but gives you enough time to plan your moves. No pain with calculating time units, the interface shows very well how far you can go and still shoot.  Overall: A very well designed game with a great story, intense combat, good visuals, sounds and music.

Yes, I was one of the throng who fondly remembered the original X-COM and believed that this game was a pale, dumbed-down remake for the console generation.  However, I recently dusted it off and gave it another try. I've been pleasantly surprised.   I'm not going to sit here and say it's a great game, because the strategic part still feels to me like it's on rails and is way more restricting than I'd like. I also won't go in to the myriad reasons why the strategic element is a let down, because three years after release you can bet everyone else has already covered all my possible gripes.  What I will say is that the tactical element has a lot more depth than I first gave it credit for. I don't particularly care for the way the aliens are 'activated', but that aside the battlefield abilities of the various classes and the mechanics of cover and elevation make for a rewarding - sometimes even nail-biting - experience.  If you were sorely disappointed that this wasn't a direct X-COM remake when if fitst hit the shelves, maybe it's time you gave it another chance. If you can overlook the controversially 'streamlined' elements of the strategic side you just might find an enjoyable squad-level tactical simulation underneath.

Xcom lets you customize your soldiers, upgrade them and reward them accordly. This forms a kind of bond and makes you really feel the impact of permanent death and adds real consequences to your choices.  The difficulty of the game seems to plateau at about 1/3 of the way thru. Early on soldiers will die if an alien lands any kind of a hit on them, this makes the first handful of missions very challenging and critical. If you fail an early mission you are out men, money and your terror level will increase, which can easly snowball into losing Xcom councel members and funding. Once you get past this stage in the game, you should have things on lock to the point where losing men and being short on funds will not directly lose you the game. The difficulty does rachet up later as new aliens, weapons and ablitlies are introduced however never to the point of the early game.  The ending of the game seems a little abrupt, thankfully Xcom is more about the journey than the destination. I do wish there was a dooms day clock or some mechanic that forces the player to move quicker and make harder choices near the end. As it stands, at the end game you can sit on your hands finish off your research, engineer anything you want and level up soldiers until you have the perfect squad to send out.  The AI is just smart enough to catch and kill you if you're not paying attention. However after a while you can easily predict how it will react to a situation and use that to your advantage.  I appreciate the 'Ant Farm' base building, dispite it being fairly simple. I really wish the base assault mission used your base's layout, (Old School Xcom) instead of just a generic base map. Being able to zoom in and look around is a nice touch.  The technology tree is alittle weak and pretty linear, it does and has just enough to get by. You will find some items you can skip completely, while others are forced on you to progress the story. That's not really a problem, it is what it is.  Multiplayer is flat and boring. There is a point system you use to select troops and a handful of map to play on. I really wish there was a CoOp option.  The DLC adds some nice additions to the game, more maps, couple missions, Mech and Cyber Soldiers and more customization.  Solid replayablity, some combat maps can become repedative; achievements, DLC, difficulty settings, and a little combat RNG helps.  Xcom is what I expect out of my turn based strategy games, it sets the bar.",

I'm not afraid of difficult games, Dark souls is super difficult, you know. I broke a mouse, a headphone and a keyboard while playing DS, but each time I died in DS, I knew it was because of my own mistake not because of the ♥♥♥♥ing designer who is cheating to control the gamer which was me.   In XCOM: Enemy Unknown, when you lose a soldier or when you forced to load a save file, it does'nt feel like it happens because of your own fault, but it just feels like game is trying to put your dice at a lower amount to keep the diffculty at a good level. When it happens, you miss shots while they are even up to 90%, and all the enemies have their shots hit even when they are less than 40%, and most of their shots does high incredible amount of critical. At this moment, I yell WHAT THE ♥♥♥♥? because enemies was just like potatos until 1 minute ago and now, after just 1 minute miracle happens and enemies become into some 'Aim Bot's.

            "review_text": "XCOM: Enemy Unknown is a brilliant strategy game that hits all the right notes for its genre.   Pros: 'Ant farm' mode is surprisingly absorbing, rather than feeling like the downtime between missions. Managing the base adds to the sensation of being a military commander. You get to decide the direction XCOM will go in and make decisions to adjust your combat style past just moving your soldiers from tile to tile. Speaking of combat, I'm a big fan of the percentage chance for hitting/missing shots. Rather than weapons dealing less damage in improper conditions or only working in a certain range, you have the chance to miss entirely. This encourages strategic play (i.e. moving your assault with a shotgun into a flanking postion rather than trying to snipe from the minimum distance). Moreover, it adds to the sensation of real combat; despite all your planning, things can and will go wrong. Difficulty is high enough so that you have to at least be trying and have some idea of what you're doing but not to the point where it's frustrating to progress. Finally, despite the non-procedurally generated maps and exact same story every playthrough, the randomness of UFO encounters and diversity of combat options adds a lot of replay value. That, and the Long War mod (but that's a whole seperate beast).   Cons: Despite what you'd expect, the game gets progressively easier as time goes on. Once you get the hang of combat and stop doing stupid stuff like ignoring council missions (give me a break, it was my first playthrough) it's just a matter of when the technology comes along and your soldiers level. Challenge is lost when your squad consists of six colonels with plasma weapons. The only thing that can really make the game suddenly harder is losing part of your team. Which is another problem; it is exceptionally easy to screw up your game. One mistake in combat can cost you all your soldiers and council nations without much you can do to fix it. I love a challenge, but save scumming often seems unavoidable with XCOM.   Overall, I'd still suggest XCOM: Enemy Unknown to almost all gamers. It's fun, addictive, immersive, and provides some of the best victories to be had in gaming. Ayylmao/10.",

            "review_text": "I recommend this game but be warned: it has bugs and glitches.  Pros:  +Its fun and addicting, turn based, tactical, strategy game. +There's a lot of game (good value), that will keep you wondering what happens on the next turn. (I've come to expect this from Firaxis.) +Critical thinking and management game -- you manage your XCOM base, and depending on your performance, you either keep or lose nation (members) for your XCOM project. +Interesting plot, and CGI/voice acting isn't too bad. +It's really cool when you're tasked to capture an alien. You have to critically think of strategies to keep your troops alive and not get hurt while they attempt to do this. +The best strategy is, if you can employ it, rather than letting your troops take damage, which requires them time to heal, try to find a way to never let them get hurt in the first place. I found by playing with this as my priority, it seriously has helped my overall strategizing. Sometimes you can't help it. +It's a lot of fun just blowing the hell up out of some important building, and getting paid for it because aliens are present. Having to use rockets on a particular office building, or having to use grenades next to vehicles can make some spectacular explosive displays.  Cons: -Though I have never seen it crash to desktop, it has completely froze on me, usually right at the start of the AI's turn. I can move the mouse but the UI doesn't come back.  -I don't know what it is about the Berserker Muton but whenever this particular unit has a move, the game gets severely choppy; I guess it's because the camera anchors to this unit and it causes slow down/staggering. -I have lost a troop due to it getting it's foot stuck in the floor. I literally have had to fight an entire mission down a man, not because he was dead, but because I couldn't move him because he was glitched for some reason. -I have had to reload missions simply due to mis-clicking on a tile for a troop to move to, and have him going to some other tile. Sometimes, the isometric perspective doesn't work best, especially when you're going through an alien base or a large alien ship (like a supply ship), and you have multiple levels to deal with. This creates havoc for the already problematic unit placing tool. -Other note on the unit placing tool: it's glitchy. Attempting to move a unit to a particular location on a floor could have the floor or roof intervening on your placement, right at the time you're about to click, thus placing the unit in a bad position. It just seems to cause the floor or roof to disappear by 'flickering' on and off and is extremely annoying. I've had to reload games due to this. -Probability chance of getting a hit or being hit seems to be off by a mile at times. I don't know what it is, there's just something wrong when you go to take a shot, like say, a Sniper with a 98% chance to hit a target and he misses. Crap like that has me uttering bad words... Sometimes I wonder if the % chance to hit even makes sense in this game because I really don't think it does. I have missed enemy combatants with 85-98% chance to hit and it blows me away that when they make the same moves, they never miss. You'd think that a troop that is aiming at an enemy combatant would have the same chances as the enemy combatant in terms of hitting. Sometimes, it feels like 50/50, regardless what the aiming tooltip has to say. -Some annoyances in regards to the back and forth motion of the camera; as it zooms to whichever unit's turn it is, so you can better plan your move. Personally, I don't care about the presentation so much, especially after I'm hooked after 15 hours of gameplay; at this point, all I want to do is just play. But it's so annoying when you want to take your move and the screen is bouncing around from enemy to friendly because it has to do it's little 'focus' effect, where it centers the camera right on top of the unit whose turn it is to move. Very annoying, especially when you already know where you want to throw the grenade/launch a rocket, then you click the button on the unit for it, and it goes back to focusing/centering on the unit again, so you have to find again, the spot for launching said rocket/grenade to. And then misclicking at this time can have terrible consequences -- especially if you're not intending it, you'll have to reload your game. -I found the mini cinematics, such as watching your troop fire/throw a grenade/run to a certain location to be pointless. Deactivating them doesn't seem to speed up the game, now you just wait the 3-4 seconds instead of seeing a little cinematic, in place of watching the cinematic, as if the cinematic is playing in the background. -Would be nice if it let you customize the individual settings for like say, map scroll speed, if whether or not it will focus/center the mouse on every action for every troop (actions being grenade toss, rocket launch), the area of map scrolling (how close the mouse has to be to the edge for the map to move left or right, up or down). If whether or not you can go with a more basic tile selecting tool because the one in the game, as it is now, is very glitch and feels resource demanding (is slow in later levels, when there's a lot going on). -There have been times when I lost units that have been standing next to a vehicle, that doesn't appear to be on fire, but is actually on fire. But I wouldn't know it until after it explodes. Very annoying to discover this. I have determined that the tiny little fire on the inside of the car window, that is visible at any angle, indicates the vehicle is on fire.  -The difficulty of the game ramps up incredibly, especially after you're able shoot down a UFO that is known for taking out satellites. It becomes incredibly important to capture any alien you come across, and sometimes, they're incredibly strong. It only makes you wonder how can you possibly budget to have the best gear for your men and at the same time, have enough funding to launch all the satellites you need for all the members of your XCOM project? For instance: going against the Red Mutons that have plasma laser guns is an extremely bad idea, if all you have is carapace armor and less than plasma sniper rifles, since these guys can hit you at an incredibly long range, for a lot of health damage, and don't take much damage themselves.  -Snipers seem to be so important after just a little while. They have incredibly useful talents, such as being able to target foes that are visible by other troops. I find bringing at least two to every mission to be detrimental, while Support is okay, as long as you don't use any variation of the shotgun, and run&amp;gun ability is totally stupid, except in situations where it means you have completed a mission or saved a fellow troop -- otherwise, it's just an excellent way to lose a troop; and Heavy is terrible at long range, and will miss just about every time, but is awesome for the rockets it can launch, as well as the suppression ability -- detrimental for catching aliens. So, I think there's some balancing issues with the classes and how they come together.  -Some abilities can't be lived without and some are totally pointless.  I know, I bellyached quite a bit but it's the little things that kill in a game like this. Honestly, the game is quite fun and playable, as long as you can put up with all of it's frequently occuring glitches.",

When I got into PC, however, I was amazed at how good the game actually was.  In XCOM, you are the commander of a strike team, under the project XCOM opperation, to liberate all the aliens on Earth, and save the planet. It is VERY turned based, and forces you to think on the spot, most of the time, when you are pinned to walls against hostile ailens. The game is also very difficult. Even on normal mode, the game is tough. There will be times when you are yelling at your computer screens to try and tell your team to 'learn to aim', and other times, you will hoping that they recieve promotions and don't die.  There are some more aspects of the game, however. You need to manage the research department, to make sure the stuff that you salvage off of the remains of aliens can be studied and more thoroughly understood. There is also the workshop, wheer you can craft items to help your strike team in battle, to help other nations, and to help to fight against UFO's. You also need to manage your crew, make sure they have the best stuff they can, and make they get their promotions.  Overall, XCOM: Enemy Unknown is an amazing game, that I will definitly play more of. This is a game that I HIGHLY recommend to all players out there who REALLy like to think and analize things in games, but also, have a great time and feel satisfied after each victory.   ",

DLC is awesome....in fact it make the vanilla version better than first set of XCOM when it came out.   Emeny within....made it much better but..again...with LONG WAR mod... way better such as... mutliple assults at XCOM bases but in Vanilla version of Emeny within... just one time assult at xcom base. Like that...    Anyways...  Now there is other series came out...XCOM 2... Im tottally looking forward to more of mods. and hopefully third series if they would considering about new alien force or new story something... maybe spaceship set out to alien homeworld something...",

            "review_text": "Ok, strap in boys and girls 'cause this is gonna be a fairly long one(I think).  The game is about a secret task force, the titular XCOM, that has to defend Earth against an invading alien force with unclear motives. You need to help various countries that are invested in the XCOM project, as your lose condition is losing too many countries to the alien threat.  Let's get the main flaws out of the way first. The game doesn't exactly feel entirely complete without the Enemy Within expansion which along with the base game makes the price a bit high at first glance for a 3-4 year old game. However, it could be that the expansion adds so much that it's hard to think of the game without it.  Also, the Normal difficulty feels much too easy after a certain point in the game, to the degree where I could aggro 3 enemy squads/pods(something which is very stupid, you should only aggro 1) and take them out easily. To get a better experience of the game, to really immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the game which asks you to take on an unknown enemy, you have to play on the harder difficulties.  Another complaint, albeit a somewhat subjective one, is that weapons don't really have the variety that is present with the different types of armor. There is an armor type that grants extra HP, another 2 that amplify your soldiers mobility, one that grants the ability to turn invisible, so on and so forth. With weapons however, all classes are limited to having one type of weapon(with the exception of Assault). All new weapons that you develop are incremental improvements over their previous iterations. Perhaps it would've been nice to add some abilities depending on the weapon itself in order to make them more varied.  Another thing is that the soldier customization is disappointingly bare-bones, it's hard to make soldiers distinguishable from one another without giving them something ridiculous(my favourite soldier was Guile Theme, named so due to his fabulously ridiculous blonde hair). This is probably fixable with some mods though.  Lastly, the game is fairly buggy. Crashes are pretty infrequent, but I've had more than too many situations where the game would get stuck in one animation and I would have to restart it in order to continue or when the movement UI wouldn't work properly and I would accidentally expose a soldier.  Enough with the downers, now with the positives.  The gameplay is INSANELY fun. XCOM: Enemy Unknown is turn/squad based and you have to use cover smartly in order for your soldiers to survive and you have to think of ways of defeating enemies that are (most of the time) in solid cover themselves. It is amazing trying to outflank or flushing them out of cover with explosives, not to mention a large variety in enemies and tactics to handle each. The basic formula is extremely simple, yet it proves addictively fun.  The variety in soldier classes is also a strong pro. There are 4 basic classes with 2 others discoverable later in game(provided you have Enemy Within installed). That might not sound like a lot, but there are numerous combinations of classes that you can try in a squad. What's more, each class has various abilities that have a mutually exclusive alternative and those make the soldier play differently from one of the same class, but with a different selection of abilities.  Lastly, the game has plenty of time/money value, warranting multiple playthroughs on different difficulties, with Second Wave settings that also change the game and after that you can also try the Long War mod which is supposed to overhaul the game entirely, though I cannot say more on this since I did not try it. However, just one playthrough of the campaign took me more than 30 hours with a lot more to try left.  Some mediocre aspects of the game now.  Story. It's mysterious at first, becomes increasingly meh in the mid to late game and becomes interesting again at the end. Basebuilding outside missions. Crucial to your performance, but dull. Slingshot DLC is meh.  That's about it, overall a definite recommendation for any strategy game fan and a good way to get non-fans started on the genre.",

In particular the character animations and body language, the voice casting/acting and referential sci fi aesthetics are all superb and possibly revolutionary. The music evokes Morricone's theme for Carpenter's 'The Thing' - a big plus for me.  Crits are mighty satisfying too.  The camera is bloody awful. It continuously removes you, the player, from the equation. I'll explain; You make the last move of your turn. Perhaps you uncover some more aliens during that move on top of the ones you're already engaging. Perhaps you immediately realise that the move was an error and would simply like to load your last save. Tough luck. Now you sit there locked out of both the menu and the camera while it flits from alien move to alien move (much more snappily than if you had control of it I might add) - this could be 10+ aliens. After it's shown you all those alien moves it'll then move through any other incidents, like maybe some of your squad panicked or were poisoned or some npc dialogue in one of the (ugh) extraction missions. If any vehicles were on fire and due to explode it will move through these too. Then, after all this, you can take your thumb out of your behind and access the menu or move the camera again. The camera is also buggy and will frequently fly off on it's own into the fog of war and expect you to fetch it back ... when it's not falling through the environment.  Free aim is also a joke, clearly not optimised for anything other than controller input. Certain reproducable conditions will freeze/crash the game - known bugs that were never fixed. Line of sight is ropey. Sometimes aliens just appear out of nowhere in a room you're in (this is rare though). The so called 'rng' is also very strange. Of a particularly dubious nature is the chance for your Heavy's rocket to fire off target. Lord only knows what this chance is based on.  Thing is, all these things can be brushed off for the first few play-throughs or on difficultys up to and including classic iron man, 'cos it's a cool sci fi game, but once you're into impossible difficulty territory then they really start to get on your nerves.  Also, if you're into achievements, then you better buy Enemy Within, otherwise you'll be stuck at just above half completion since EU achievements are not separated. Reasonable proof that EW content should have been part of EU in the first place and was taken out to be sold to you for another £20 later on.  In the end though, I grudgingly recommend it.",

Or, if you've researched both already, do you BUILD plasma weapons or hover armor? That's just when you're at base; when you're on the battlefield, you have an entirely different set of options to constantly second-guess. You WILL, at some point, spot a group of aliens during your last action of the turn, and they WILL get first dibs on retaliating. Sometimes they'll rock your world, sometimes they won't, but the mere threat of them rocking your world is enough to make you load your last save.  Fortunately, on the default difficulty setting, the game is quite forgiving of mistakes, because the AI is intentionally dumbed down, sometimes to the point that enemies do literally nothing on their turn. You can still complete the game even if you make several 'wrong' choices. Especially because, as implied in the last paragraph, save scumming is an integral part of keeping the game going. Save early and often. (It baffles me than Ironman mode even exists...and further baffles me that people have completed it.)",

            "review_text": "An easy recommendation for people who like turn based tactics games.  Be aware though: Enemy Unknown relies heavily on percentages to hit. You can mitigate that to a pretty decent extent, but just remember that a 99% chance to hit can still fail. Plan ahead.  The game consists of 2 layers. The first one is the meta game, building your base, conducting research, hiring and training new soldiers, etc. The second one is the actual combat, of which there is a lot. The 2 layers work hand in hand. You need a strong base and a good economy to actually have enough well trained soldiers to stand a chance in the battles themselves. These battles are turn based. You control up to 6 soldiers, all with potentially unique skills and gear. You are forced to make use of cover, otherwise your soldiers will drop like flies. Cover reduces the chance to be hit...but not the actual damage received. Same goes for the aliens of course. Flanking is a thing and is required in order to be effective. Same goes for height advantage. It's really quite an intricate system. Flanking an opponent often guarantees you a 100 chance to hit. Every hit can also be a crit if you have the right modifiers on your guys.  Missions vary from rescuing civilians to securing objects or killing all aliens. Actually there's not that much variation, but there are a lot of different maps and setups that still make it interesting. I strongly advise you to disable the action cam pretty soon. It gets lame and annoying quickly. Enemies can be captured, killed or 'obliterated' (with explosives). Capturing enables you to interrogate them (once per species) and to grab their weapons intact. Killed enemies leave weapon fragments behind, which are necessary for upgrades. Explosives are strong, but if an enemy is killed by them, all equipment is lost.  The later stages of the game introduce a LOT of different options and concepts, especially with the Enemy Within expansion, which adds a new resource type to genetically enhance your soldiers (higher jumping, immune to mind control, better perception, etc.) and turn them into cybernetic supersoldiers (MECs), which are the ultimate warrior, but require a lot of resources and research. Seriously though, the game has so many different resource types and things to do, it's hard to get it all done. On my easy playthrough I had 2 MEC soldiers and only a few genetic upgrades, because everything costs everything kinda. Would you rather invest in genetically enhanced soldiers, MECs, items, or maybe fighter jets and improvements for them? On easy, this is not so much a problem, but on the harder difficulties you will feel every death of a really good soldier, you will have to decide which countries you want to save, which research you want to pursue and which battles you can win. Play on Iron Man and every decision is final. No going back to another save file.  And trust me, the game can be brutal. You can dominate your enemies, but all it takes is one mistake or a little bit of bad luck for one or two of your soldiers getting insta killed. And here lies my one big gripe with the game: Enemy movement. Whenever you move across the map (from cover to cover) you can trigger enemy movement, i.e. you can encounter a pack of enemies, which then get a free move (at least they can't attack you yet). There is no real way to surprise enemies. Maybe with enough heigth advantage or the 'cloaking armor'. When fighting these enemies and maneuvering around you may just trigger another group...and so on. Things can quickly escalate, especially in the later stages of the game, which fields much stronger enemies as your soldiers get stronger as well.  Enemy Within also introduces another enemy: The Exalt...human traitors. They are the single most boring thing in the expansion. Their missions are interesting exactly once. After that you have to SUFFER through the same cutscenes over and over and over again, since they are not skippable. Yes, I know I have to hack the radio towers...good god. The missions aren't even particularly fun...and you will be doing a lot of them until you find their base of operations, which is an anticlimactic fight. So disappointed with these. They're also pretty weak. Your specialists will melt them.  Apart from that it's a really fun game. Go get it!",

That's where after being wounded in battle a soldier rarely may sit at the bottom of the roster Wounded, unusable, with no timeclock, forever. Characters stuck this way (and undeletable, too) apparently can never be recovered unless you have a save to restore to in which they're not bugged, which I no longer did by the time I understood what had happened.  Sometimes the RNG just seems to be out for some nice, yummy player blood.   Pros:  It arrived, I installed it, I sat down to play it, I looked up and holy crap the sun was rising... And I wanted to keep playing.  I got hit by the accursed Wounded bug, and I still wanted to keep playing.  I got crushed in a campaign battle in which several of my soldiers had an 80+% chance to hit, they missed every shot, and the aliens proceeded to hog all the good dicerolls for themselves and plasma-BBQ my team in two rounds. I still wanted to keep playing.  My friend and much more experienced XCOM player repeatedly kicked my butt into a new postal code in PVP mode... while I flew the clueless newbie flag high and goofed up in every imaginable way and a few ways I wouldn't have imagined... and I still want to keep playing and to someday, if not win, then at least fail less hard in a rematch.

Adds a ton of options, customizable soldier options, new story mission, new rewards, more ways to deal with aliens (new useable items like flashbangs for example). Really opens up the game to have a lot more variety.   BUT ABOVE ALL ELSE, getting the Enemy Within content allows you to play with the Long War mod. Long War is free, and basically installs itself. It can be so brutal and fun, can make the game take much longer to complete, makes it much more possible to lose (like if you lose some of your best troops over and over, the aliens will just stomp you). It really makes the game what I think it should be imo. Revamps air battle, makes money and building your base much more important, mistakes you make really impact you.    So if you just get the vanilla XCOM: Enemy Unknown it is a good buy and can be a ton of fun learning and replaying. If you can get the Enemy Within DLC content it really makes the game much less rigid than vanilla. And if you choose, can play Long War if you have the DLC (pretty sure there is a non dlc long war, but it has much less features than the Enemy Within version). And Long War will really just ♥♥♥♥ your ♥♥♥♥ up so much, and you might enjoy that too. I've had a ton of fun with it and can replay it and have it be different everytime.",

Edit 1.  Also, this game really reminds me of Valkyria Chronicles ( in how the gameplay works).",

You get money from each area if you set up satellites as well as other things like Engineers or Scientists.   Research and Engineering facilities to discover and make new items with resources you find.   Base has a Fallout vault feel to it.
