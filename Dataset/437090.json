A nice platformer that is challenging and not for those looking for something casual, even though it might seem like it. The game does well as a platformer as it has a lot of levels but that pretty much sums up the game. I believe more could've been done for the game, like a story for example (if there is a story then it's not shown properly and clearly).  Here is some gameplay from my YouTube channel:         YouTubeâ„¢ Video:  CUTE PINK CREATURES! // Let's Play // Wobbly Jungle&nbsp;",
